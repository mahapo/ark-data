Flowers V°- 9 -A1: The Sphinx and the Chimæra- a conversation recorded & annotated by Michael A. Aquino IV°May 30, 1975In this Greater Black Magic working, a sphinx and a chimæra were evoked tomanifestation in orderto explore certain magical implications of the Dialogues of Plato. Placed uponthe altar: The CollectedDialogues of Plato , Hamilton & Cairns (Ed.), Princeton University Press, 1961CE.The Sphinx: I think it essential to preface any discussion of a single Platonicdialogue with two majorqualifications. The first is that, to be treated without distortion, Plato’sphilosophy must be appreciated inits entirety. Emphasis upon any single dialogue or group of dialogues carrieswith it a certain unfairness tothe author.The Chimæra: Yet our span of materialization is limited, and we cannot hope totreat the entire range of Plato’sthought in the time available to us.The Sphinx: True, and so let us focus first upon The Sophist, which illustratesmany of the points most importantto this investigation.The Chimæra: But what is your second qualification?The Sphinx: There is the problem of understanding what Plato “really meant”.This is an issue against which I ampowerless to defend myself. I am of Khem and not of Hellas; I am bilingual onlyin English and hence mustdepend upon my understanding of Plato as he is translated into the Englishlanguage. The dialogues centermuch of their discussion around terms whose final definitions are elusive atbest, even in conversationscarried out at intellectual planes below that of Plato. Then, too, there isalways the spectre of imprecisetranslation from the Greek to the English. And Plato himself could notanticipate this.The Chimæra: Your qualifications are entirely acceptable. Proceed.The Sphinx: The initial question raised by The Sophist is its raison d’être. Whyshould Plato have felt it necessaryto include such a dialogue as this in his philosophy at all? Was it trulybecause the included lines ofargument required exposure? Or did Plato intend the document rather as agauntlet of sorts to be flungbefore the Sophists themselves?The Chimæra: I sense that the editors of this book ventured one explanation.Grasping it with a forepaw, heturns to page #958. Yes, here it is:The argument is hung on the figure of the Sophist quite arbitrarily. No realpicture is given of themen who were the professional instructors of Greece for many years. All Platodoes is ascribe tothem every notion he disapproves. He detested the whole band of Sophists. To himthey wereshallow-minded, pretentious, superficial, mercenary - they were really doingwhat Socrates wascharged with, corrupting the minds of the young.And this appears to be reinforced by the dialogue’s concluding statement, whichseems to be little more thanan outright vilification of Sophistry. He turns to page #1016 and quotes:The art of contradiction-making, descended from an insincere kind of conceitedmimicry, ofthe semblance-making breed, derive from imagemaking, distinguished as a portion,notdivine but human, of production, that presents a shadowy play of words - suchare the bloodand lineage which can, with perfect truth, be assigned to the authentic Sophist.The Sphinx: Obviously that is not an objective philosophical statement. It is adeliberate insult reached through adialectical process which, in retrospect, seems a transparent parody of Plato’smore serious argumentativestyle. In most of the Platonic dialogues one feels that Socrates is not“managing” the conversation towardsan end that he has conceptualized beforehand. But every twist and turn of TheSophist is designed only tochannel the conversation into providing a part of that final statement.The Chimæra: But how would you have Plato compose such a definition, save by asummary of the componentarguments preceding it?- 10 -The Sphinx: I quarrel not with the final assembly process, but rather with thefashion in which the componentsthemselves were forged. For, you see, there are many ways along which each ofthose component argumentscould have proceeded. Each, however, consistently follows a path derogatory tothe Sophists. If the Sophistswere in fact personifications of all that is erroneous and destructive inteaching, all possible paths wouldlead to the same conclusion, i.e. one derogatory to the Sophists. But this isnot the case at all. See - He takesthe book from the Chimæra and turns to page #973:STRANGER: They cross-examine a man’s words, when he thinks that he is sayingsomething and isreally saying nothing, and easily convict him of inconsistencies in hisopinions; these they thencollect by the dialectic process, and, placing them side by side, show that theycontradict oneanother about the same things, in relation to the same things, and in the samerespect. He, seeingthis, is angry with himself, and grows gentle towards others, and thus isentirely delivered fromgreater prejudices and harsh notions, in a way which is most amusing to thehearer, and producesthe most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation.For as the physicianconsiders that the body will receive no benefit from taking food until theinternal obstacles havebeen removed, so the purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient willreceive no benefit fromthe application of knowledge until he is refuted, and from refutation learnsmodesty; he must bepurged of his prejudices first and made to think that he knows only what heknows, and no more.THEÆTETUS: That is certainly the best and wisest state of mind.STRANGER: For all these reasons, Theætetus, we must admit that refutation is thegreatest andchiefest of purifications, and he who has not been refuted, though he be theGreat King himself, is inan awful state of impurity; he is uninstructed and deformed in those things inwhich he who wouldbe truly blessed ought to be fairest and purest.THEÆTETUS: Very true.STRANGER: Well, what name shall we give to the practitioners of this art? For mypart I shrinkfrom calling them Sophists.THEÆTETUS: Why so?STRANGER: For fear of ascribing to them too high a function.THEÆTETUS: And yet your description has some resemblance to that type (theSophist).STRANGER: So has the dog to the wolf - the fiercest of animals to the tamest.But a cautious manshould above all be on his guard against resemblances; they are a very slipperysort of thing.Now let me rewrite the latter part of the dialogue. In doing so I shall move toeliminate the stranger’sinstinctive or preconceived notion of what Sophists actually are. The Sphinxgestures at the page, and thewording changes:STRANGER: Well, what name shall we give to the practitioners of this art?THEÆTETUS: The characteristics you have enumerated are those the Sophists use todescribethemselves.STRANGER: But I fear this ascribes too high a function to them.THEÆTETUS: To say that individual Sophists may not achieve the standards theyhave set forthemselves does not disprove the nobility of their goal, nor their right toclaim it as a standard andhence an identifying characteristic of their profession.STRANGER: I cannot find fault with that. But let us examine the Sophist fromsome other vantage-points.The wording reverts to normal, and the Sphinx closes the book.I do not say that the dialogue should have proceeded in a different direction. Imerely demonstrate that itwould have been possible. This fact - that it is possible -testifies to thelooseness of Plato’s logic in this- 11 -instance. Rather than refining the definition of the Sophist by the carefulelimination of inconsistentcharacteristics, Plato simply ignores implications which do not support hispreconceived notions.The Chimæra: I’m beginning to see what you mean.The Sphinx: There are other examples which I could take from the text. But Ithink this demonstration sufficientproof of the principle involved. The entire dialogue is not an attempt tounderstand what a Sophist is. It isan attempt to denigrate Sophists. As such it is of no value as an exercise inlogic or in the true process ofreduction.The Chimæra: But now we are back where we started, enriched only by an irony ofSocratic logic: We know whatThe Sophist is not, but we don’t know what it is. So we must consider why Platofelt it necessary to attackthe Sophists at all. Why did he not feel it possible merely to coexist with themin friendly competition formen’s minds?The Sphinx: Here we must depart from the dialogue as a universe in itself. Wemust try to place it in contextamidst a larger and more complex universe. The reason for doing this is that,viewed in isolation, TheSophist is logically invalid; this we have just proven. Seen against a largerbackground, however, it mayindeed be significant. We attempt, like Archimedes, to move a world. For a placeto stand we have theexistence of The Sophist; for a lever we have its bias. The world need move onlya little, and we who pushagainst the lever may count ourselves satisfied.The Chimæra: I follow you, but beware of unsubstantiated speculation.The Sphinx: The proponent of a viewpoint who feels secure in his position willnot find it necessary to attack themere existence of opponents. He may point out the fallacies in their argumentsin an effort to hasten theirunderstanding of his “correct interpretation”. But he will not see their“incorrect” views as a threat to thetruth of his own. An attack against the very existence of competition is mountedwhen one is uncertain ofthe invulnerability of one’s own position. Permitted to exist, competition mightpose a mortal challenge.Hence it must be destroyed without delay. Such a preemptory strike is justifiedby the rationalization that,while one has glimpsed an ultimate truth, more time is needed to refine theideas to a form which may beunderstood by those of lesser intellectual acumen.The Chimæra: You are suggesting, then, that Plato may not have felt secure inhis philosophy - that he feared theaxioms upon which he based his logic to be false?The Sphinx: Let us not say that he feared them to be false. It is enough to saythat he may not have beencompletely certain of their truth. Had he been, he would have ignored theSophists.The Chimæra: Why should Plato have attacked the Sophists in particular? Was itsimply because they were hisonly Athenian competition? That would make his motives rather materialistic.The Sphinx: Here we should bear in mind that we have no precise catalogue ofindividuals whom Plato consideredSophists. At various times he took issue with the ideas of Heraclitus,Parmenides, Zeno, and Protagoras, toname but a few theorists. Whether he considered the Sophists as comprising onlyspecific individuals, orwhether he considered Sophism more broadly to be composed of all challengers tohis own philosophy, is anissue we cannot decide. If we are to look through Plato’s eyes via The Sophist,we can establish only that theSophists were guilty of teaching according to methods too close to those ofPlato himself.The Chimæra: You mean, I take it, by the process of cross-examination describedby the stranger in the passagewe considered earlier?The Sphinx: Precisely. I ask you to consider both the praise that the strangeraccords the system itself and hisunsubstantiated reluctance to credit that system to the Sophists. Historycontains many examples pointingto the fact that the most dangerous threats are those akin to the favoredphilosophy in all ways save one -which is considered to be crucial. Wars have been fought simply because men wereunable to agree uponone name for the same god, or, later, because they could not agree upon the samemeanings for words suchas “freedom”, “democracy”, and “equality”.The Chimæra: Only two wars that I recall strike me as having made any sense: theTrojan War, which was foughtfor sex, and the Carthaginian Wars, which were fought for money.- 12 -The Sphinx: Very funny. But to return to the issue at hand, we have the evidenceof that passage in The Sophist tosubstantiate this point. Plato regarded the process of teaching throughcross-examination to be a standardof excellence in itself. Its use to teach anything other than pure philosophy,accordingly, would have beenintolerable to him. Hence his extraordinary anger at the Sophists.The Chimæra: But we do know more about the Sophists than that. Even if we limitour scope to the school ofProtagoras, we know that Sophistic thinking disavowed absolute knowledge.Despairing of attaining suchknowledge, they regarded even its pursuit as worthless. So they taught a sort ofrelativistic pragmatism asthe only sound basis for human affairs. Hence Protagoras’ famous statement thatman is the measure of allthings.The Sphinx: That is right. And we know that Plato was firmly opposed to thisview. Perhaps our most convincingevidence of this is the inscription above the entrance to his Academy: Let noone ignorant ofmathematics enter here.The Chimæra: I thought it was “geometry”.The Sphinx: Unfortunately for purists it has been recorded both ways. But eitherserves to illustrate the point.Plato saw in mathematics unshakable evidence that there was an absolute standardfor the Universe. Andwhere one such standard existed, it was logical to assume that there wereothers. Today humans regardmathematics principally as an applied science, but in Plato’s time it wasconsidered by the Pythagoreans tobe “pure”, having nothing to do with the gross and imperfect everyday world.The Chimæra: I presume that Plato would have been somewhat upset to learn of theTheory of Relativity, which isinconsistent with the notion that mathematics adhere to a fixed standard. But doI understand you to saythat Plato was a Pythagorean?The Sphinx: Not in the sense that he had any connections with one of thePythagorean schools as such. He wasborn in Athens in 427 BCE, and he was a disciple of Socrates from 409 to 399.Following Socrates’ executionin that year, Plato traveled abroad, absorbing Pythagorean doctrines in many ofthe Greek cities located inItaly and Africa. It was not until 387 that he returned to Athens to found hisAcademy.The Chimæra: That is interesting, but it does not constitute evidence that Platoendorsed the views of thePythagoreans.The Sphinx: No, and for that one must turn to the Timæus, wherein Plato presentshis concept of the Universe.Here he describes the five possible regular solids - that is, those withequivalent faces and with all lines andangles equal. Four of those represented the four elements, he said, while thedodecahedron represented theUniverse as a whole. He also postulated that the various stellar/planetarybodies move in exact circles (theperfect curve) along with the crystalline spheres (the perfect solid) holdingthem in place. All of thesetheories were originally Pythagorean, as one may see from the writings ofPhilolaus and other avowedPythagoreans. But we wander too far afield. Let us return to Plato’s convictionthat the Universe was basedupon absolute, not relative standards.The Chimæra: I presume that the Sophists did not consider mathematics as aninvalidation of their relativism.The Sphinx: Whether the issue centered around mathematics or not is something wecannot know. We do knowthat the Sophists considered whatever evidence Plato offered insufficient todislodge them from theirposition. From their point of view, the Sophists were champions of logic. Theybased their arguments uponwhat they understood to be “obvious” realities. And they drew “common sense”conclusions. What soantagonized Plato was not that they held different views than his concerning theprimal forces of theUniverse. Rather it was the intolerable insult - in Plato’s eyes - that theywere not interested in that topic asa field for rational inquiry. Plato must have felt somewhat akin to Noahbuilding his Ark in the midst of anignorant and unconcerned society.The Chimæra: The Noah legend is not in our myth-cycle, if you please.The Sphinx: My apologies.The Chimæra: And so Plato wished to identify the primal forces of the Universe.This resulted in his famousTheory of the Forms, if I am correct. But I sense a weak point here. Plato was afinite being, and yet hedesired to comprehend Universal absolutes. As perfect standards they wouldnecessarily be infinite, sinceany measure of perfection must extend in all dimensions without limitation. Itwould be possible for a finite- 13 -entity like Plato to comprehend the infinite without distortion only if theinfinite reveals aspects of itself toand through the finite. But the finite must have faith or trust that the aspectsare undistorted in theirpresentation.The Sphinx: Precisely, and now we are getting to the crux ansata of the matter.For, you see, assumptions basedupon faith or trust are logically indefensible, otherwise there would be no needto base them upon faith ortrust to begin with. Plato, being a man of no mean intellect, was certainlyaware of this. He feared that anintelligent Sophist might see it as well and proceed to attack the foundationsof his entire philosophy asillogical. And so, in the dialogues, he constructed a very elaborate defense ofhis concepts according,apparently, to the most rigorous standards of the cross-examination system ofthe Sophists.The Chimæra: Statements like that are liable to get you into a great deal oftrouble, I hope you know.The Sphinx: Only with those who underestimate Plato and interpret this as a sluragainst him. Quite the contrary,it is all the more indicative of his brilliance. The entire process of “logicalreasoning” is ultimately circular.What humans loosely tern “cause and effect” relationships are not really that atall. They are ratherobservations of phenomena believed to occur consistently under identicalenvironments. But logic cannotexplain why electrons circle protons, or why the color red and the color blueare distinct, or why theUniverse exists at all. Yet every one of our senses tells us that these thingsare so, and if we, as Descartes,deny the validity of our sensory input, we resign ourselves to insanity. Plato’sfaith derives from no greaterand no lesser observation that things are what they seem to be. Once thatconsistency is granted, all elsefollows.The Chimæra: If that is so, why should Plato have gone through all the troubleto create the dialogues? Merely as ablind for Sophist critics who might have interfered with his Academy or accusedhim personally of beingirrational or illogical?The Sphinx: Again the explanation is not that simple. The dialogues may indeedhave served as a blind for theSophists, inasmuch as they defend Platonic principles according, apparently, toSophistic logical criteria.But the dialogues would thus serve only a negative function, and that hardlyseems to justify the obviouseffort of their preparation. Plato was first and foremost a teacher, and hewould have designed the dialoguesto teach.The Chimæra: That appears to run afoul of your previous statement that faith andreason are mutually exclusive.If Platonic students studied the dialogues only to become skilled at theSophistic argumentative proceduresemployed therein, they would complete the Academy only as skilled Sophists.The Sphinx: We are at something of an impasse. I confess that I cannot resolvethis evident inconsistency. Let usseek fresh counsel.Quite suddenly there materializes a Gryphon.The Gryphon: The dilemma can be resolved, but it is so constructed that itdefies resolution by Sophistic logic.And that is precisely the trap into which the two of you have fallen. Indeed thedialogues are there to teach,but the student must put forth the effort to see past the Sophistic teachings tothose of Plato himself.The Chimæra: But the argumentative pattern of the dialogues is Sophistic, andany connection between Sophisticlogic and Platonic faith cannot exist. Do you think to pursue me?The Gryphon: The key to Plato rests in the Meno. Here - He turns to page #364:SOCRATES: Those who tell it are priests and priestesses of the sort who make ittheir business to beable to account for the functions which they perform. Pindar speaks of it too,and many another ofthe poets who are divinely inspired. What they say is this - see whether youthink they are speakingthe truth. They say that the soul of a man is immortal. At one time it comes toan end - that which iscalled death - and at another is born again, but is never finally exterminated.On these grounds aman must live all his days as righteously as possible.For those from whomPersephone receives requittal for ancient doomIn the ninth year she restores againTheir souls to the Sun aboveFrom whom rise noble kings- 14 -And the swift in strength and greatest in wisdom,And for the rest of timeThey are called heroes and sanctified by men.Thus the soul, since it is immortal and has been born many times, and has seenall things both hereand in the other world, has learned everything there is. So we need not besurprised if it can recallthe knowledge of virtue or anything else which, as we see, it once possessed.All nature is akin, andthe soul has learned everything, so that when a man has recalled a single pieceof knowledge -learned it, in ordinary language - there is no reason why he should not find outall the rest, if hekeeps a stout heart and does not grow weary of the search, for seeking andlearning are in factnothing but recollection.The Chimæra: You imply, then, that it is not the object of the dialogues to“teach” at all -but rather to exposePlato’s students to demanding mental gymnastics which will inspire them torecollect knowledge of theForms.The Gryphon: You have recollected admirably. The Gryphon dematerializes.The Sphinx: Is it not interesting that the example given by Socrates in the Menoemploys mathematics andgeometry? That ties in rather neatly with the inscription over the entrance tothe Academy. To the Platonicphilosopher, then, that inscription would have meant something more than mereability to calculate areas oftriangles. In effect it would say: “Let no one ignorant of the recollectivebasis of knowledge leave here.”The Chimæra: Harking back to what you said concerning Plato’s exposure toPythagorean concepts, it is quiteappropriate. Mathematical consistency was Plato’s “foot in the door”, so tospeak, where the Forms wereconcerned. Yet, in view of relativity, does not that door slam shut upon us?The Sphinx: That’s the Hades of it; it doesn’t. Or rather it does, but anotherone opens simultaneously.The Chimæra: Do you mean that relativity provides access to another Form similarto mathematical consistency,upon which a modern Plato could base a Theory of the Forms?The Sphinx: No, not really. But what relativity has done has been to turn theMeno inside-out. Look here: Socratesproves the immortality of the soul by demonstrating its intrinsic grasp ofmathematics, which he considereda Form. Pause here and consider: What, precisely, is immortality?The Chimæra: I should say the continuous existence of the mind or soul.The Sphinx: That would be the case if there were no such thing as relativity.But there is. So let us say rather thatimmortality is the ability of the mind or the soul to exist unbounded by time,i.e. the fourth dimension.Mortality is measured according to the notion that time is a constant. Butrelativity disproves this, showingthat time may be retarded, hastened, stopped altogether, or, presumably, raisedto infinity. Thus the prisonof a so-called temporal span of existence is no real prison at all. It is onlyimagined as such by a minduntrained in fourth-dimensional movement. The mind that is immortal is one thatbreaks free of time, notone that merely plods along within it as it ticks off the æons.The Chimæra: And so the same principles of relativity that destroy Plato’sfirst-known Form now open the door tothe very immortality which he sought through knowledge of the Forms.Fascinating.The Sphinx: Now we must consider the implications of this as applied to thenotion of recollection of knowledge.When Socrates used the term in the passage cited by the gryphon, he meant it ofcourse in terms of a fixedfourth dimension. He visualized the soul as plodding along through the æons,“seeing all things” along theway. Thus, by the time it reached incarnation in Greece circa 400 BCE, it hadcompleted some 9.5 to 10.5billion years’ “sightseeing” since the last Universal concentration of radiationunderwent transformationinto matter and antimatter, making it possible for existence to displace vacuum.The Chimæra: Just out of curiosity, how do you come up with ten billion years?The Sphinx: Simply by dividing the distances of the known galaxies from thecalculated metagalactic center of thisexpansion cycle by their speeds according to the Red Shifts, then taking anaverage. But we digress again.We must still work out the nature of the acquisition of knowledge.- 15 -The Chimæra: If the invalidation of time as a constant has been shown, then themind or soul could not haveacquired knowledge via an æonic sightseeing trip such as Socrates describes. Butthe mind possesses thecapability to cast itself forward and backward through time, since time is notfixed.The Sphinx: Correct. The process is to imagination what directed thinking is tounconscious dreaming. It issomething like the Raja-Yoga technique of uniting the mind to a single ideathrough force of will, or likecorresponding ceremonial magic techniques.The Chimæra: But I thought that the object of Yoga is to break the cycle ofbirth-death-rebirth through union ofthe soul or mind with the whole of existence. To one who achieves the eighthstage, samadhi, the concept ofknowledge - itself a relative measurement of that which is known versus thatwhich is not known - would bemeaningless. All would be known, or, to use a more precise term, realized.Nothing would remain to be“learned”.The Sphinx: Indeed.The Chimaera: I think I am beginning to see your point. There is an identitybetween the state of samadhi and theinnate condition of the mind or soul as Plato perceived it. Both exist in astate of absolute awareness,including, presumably, the freedom to move through all dimensions including thatof time. Thus they breakthe bonds of both a finite period and a finite path of existence, achieving trueimmortality. Earthlyincarnation becomes a prison in terms of both time and space, and it is theincarnated mind’s ability totravel within time that allows it to break free from this prison. The ambitionof Plato, like that of the Yogi,was to regain the freedom of mental movement through all dimensions of existence- which, of course,would provide access to knowledge of the Forms.The Sphinx: That is right. And the final proof of this is that Adepts in allcultures and all ages have inclinedtowards this same realization, no matter what exploratory methods they may haveused and what linguisticterminology they may have employed. “Proof” in the scientific sense is theachievement of identical resultsunder identical circumstances by independent researchers. Our comparison of justtwo initiatory systems -that of Plato and that of Yoga - meets these criteria exactly, given that the“identical circumstance” in thiscase is Earthly incarnation.The Chimæra: Similar evidence could be obtained from additional case studies ofother initiatory systems. But onesubstantiation suffices for our discussion.The Sphinx: And now, I think, we are finally in a position to understand Plato’sdistinction of the work of a truephilosopher from that of a sophist. Let us return to The Sophist. He turns topage #998:STRANGER: Well, now that we have agreed that the kinds stand toward one anotherin the sameway as regards blending, is not some science needed as a guide on the voyage ofdiscourse, if one isto succeed in pointing out which kinds are consonant, and which are incompatiblewith one another- also, whether there are certain kinds that pervade them all and connect themso that they canblend, and again, where there are divisions [separations], whether there arecertain others thattraverse wholes and are responsible for the division? ... And the man who can dothat discernsclearly one form everywhere extended throughout many, where each one lies apart,and manyforms, different from one another, embraced from without by one form, and againone formconnected in a unity through many wholes, and many forms, entirely marked offapart. That meansknowing how to distinguish, kind by kind, in what ways the several kinds can orcannot combine.The Chimæra: I am well satisfied. Now that we have resolved the questions raisedby The Sophist, it seemsnecessary to consider The Statesman as well.The Sphinx: We know that The Statesman was written as a sequel to The Sophist -that Plato intended his idealstatesman to be antithetical to the “worst possible kind” of Sophist. Observe:He turns to page #1074.STRANGER: Therefore all who take part in one of these governments - apart fromthe one basedupon real knowledge - are to be distinguished from the true statesman. They arenot statesmen; theyare party leaders, leaders of bogus governments and themselves as bogus as theirsystems. Thesupreme imitators and tricksters, they are of all Sophists the archSophists.YOUNG SOCRATES: It seems to me that the wheel has come full circle, now that thetitle of Sophistgoes to those who most deserve it, to the men who get themselves calledpolitical leaders.- 16 -The Chimæra: That may be nothing more than another of Plato’s invectives againstthe Sophists in general - a bitof name-calling without real substance. Such seems to be the opinion of academiccritics, who are prone toignore this exchange. But let us reexamine Plato’s alienation from the Sophists.As I said earlier:Even if we limit our scope to the school of Protagoras, we know that Sophisticthinking disavowedabsolute knowledge. Despairing of attaining such knowledge, they regarded evenits pursuit asworthless. So they taught a sort of relativistic pragmatism as the only soundbasis for human affairs.Hence Protagoras’ famous statement that man is the measure of all things.The Sphinx: We then considered the Pythagorean precedents for Plato’s convictionthat the Universe adheres toabsolute and not relative standards. But how does this tie in with TheStatesman?The Chimæra: The connection seems to be that Plato considers statesmanship alsoto be absolute and not relative.Observe the following key passage: He turns to pages #1051-2.STRANGER: Must we not do now what we had to do when discussing the Sophist? Wehad to insistthen on the admission of an additional postulate, that “what is ‘not x’nevertheless exists”. We hadto introduce this postulate because the only alternative to asserting it whichour argument left uswas to allow the Sophist to escape definition altogether. In our presentdiscussion too there is anadditional postulate on which we must insist, and it is this: “Excess anddeficiency are measurablenot only in relative terms but also in respect of attainment of a norm or duemeasure.” For if wecannot first gain assent to this postulate, we are bound to fail if we advancethe claim that a manpossesses statecraft, or indeed that a man possesses any other of the specialforms of knowledgethat function in human society.YOUNG SOCRATES: In that case we must certainly follow the precedent and admitthe additionalpostulate in our present discussion too.STRANGER: Our present task is greater than our previous one, Socrates, and wecan hardly haveforgotten what a very long time that took us. However, while discussing theseproblems, there is onething to be said at the outset that it is perfectly right and proper to sayhere.YOUNG SOCRATES: What is this?STRANGER: That when one day we come to give a full exposition of true accuracyin dialecticmethod, we shall find the need of this postulate concerning the due measurewhich we have justenunciated. However, the statement in the form we have made it and with thedemonstration -adequate for present purposes - which we have given of it, is a very great helpto us, or so it seems tome. For it shows that two propositions stand or fall together. The first is thatthe arts exist; thesecond is that excess and deficiency are measurable not only relatively but interms of therealization of a norm or due measure. Thus if measure in this second senseexists, so do the arts,and, conversely, if there are arts, then there is this second kind ofmeasurement. To deny either is todeny both.The Sphinx: That “existence of ‘not x’ postulate”, as I recall, left somethingto be desired in terms of logicalintegrity. The point hinged upon things that were not themselves “existence”being able to exist. Indistinguishing them from “existence”, Plato treats “existence” as an entity.But, when saying that certainthings “exist”, he treats “exist” as a quality. That is inconsistent and henceinconclusive. He glances atpage #1003 indignantly, then turns to pages #1050-1. And what sort ofdemonstration of this secondpostulate does he offer?STRANGER: On the other hand, will we not also be ready to assert that we do infact hear wordsspoken and see acts done which at one time exceed the essentially right measureand at anothertime fall short of it? Is it not just this matter of attaining the due measurewhich marks off good menfrom bad in human society?The Chimæra: That’s not much of a proof. The words or actions that impress oneobserver as ideal may strikeanother as excessive or inadequate. Similarly “good” and “bad” are subjectiveterms. Plato is guilty of a nonsequitur.The Sphinx: True. If the stranger had been talking with someone like Protagorasinstead of the docile youngSocrates, The Statesman would have floundered [and foundered] right there.- 17 -The Chimæra: Note that, immediately after making that statement, Plato tries toreinforce it by denying thatstatecraft - or any other art - can exist without it. Thus he assumes thatstatecraft has already been proved tobe an absolute standard, when in fact it has not. Two unproved statements cannotbe used to prove eachother, and so Plato is guilty of a second logical fallacy, generally known asinterdependence.The Sphinx: Since the rest of The Statesman hinges upon young Socrates’ blinddisregard of these two fallacies, isthere a point in our discussing it further? What we have uncovered here is notsome relatively-unimportantdigression. The subsequent structure of The Statesman is one of peeling awayinadequate manifestations ofstatesmanship, leaving, theoretically, the Form itself at the core. If there isnot an agreed-upon Form, thenthe peeling-away process is pointless.The Chimæra: To be fair to Plato, let us examine his idea of the Form ofstatesmanship. He turns to page #1077.STRANGER: If you will view the three arts we have spoken of as a group with acommon character,you will be bound to see that none of them has turned out to be itself the artof statesmanship. Thisis because it is not the province of the real kingly art to act for itself, butrather to control the workof the arts which instruct us in the methods of action. The kingly art controlsthem according to itspower to perceive the right occasions for undertaking and setting in motion thegreat enterprises ofstate. The other arts must do what they are told to do by the kingly art ... Itis a universal art, and sowe call it by a name of universal scope. That name is one which I believe tobelong to this art andthis alone, the name of “statesmanship”.The Sphinx: On the whole, that’s not a bad definition. And, I might add, thereis nothing in it which necessitatesthe existence of an absolute standard for statesmanship. A statesman can simplybe a person who isrelatively skilled at emphasizing, directing, and applying the various arts andsciences of a state orcommunity.The Chimæra: So it would seem. In view of Plato’s attack on “arch-Sophists” asbeing the leaders of all but theperfect [Form] government, one might suspect that he insisted upon an absolutestandard of governmentjust so that he could attribute everything less than that to Sophistry. Havingdelivered such anuncomplimentary blow to both Sophists and politicians, Plato could quietlyabandon the notion of anabsolute governmental standard. In fact, the definition that I just quoted isthoroughly relativistic andcannot be applied in terms of absolute standards.The Sphinx: And just how do you draw that conclusion?The Chimæra: If each subordinate art in a community possesses its own standardof absolute perfection, a raisingor lowering of the application of that art by the statesman would cause excessor deficiency in the art itself.For example, the military art involves winning battles and wars. If thestatesman, for the good of the entirecommunity, prevents the military from conducting battles or wars, the militaryart itself experiences adeficiency. At a later date, if the military does go to war, that deficiencywill be evident as inexperience incombat. Similarly, if the statesman orders the military to fight too manybattles or wars, excess will occur.The military will become inefficient through demoralization and attrition. Topermit the military to functionat an ideal level, a statesman would have to allow a level of continuous orintermittent warfare. This,obviously, would not be ideal for the state as a whole.The Sphinx: Your point being that the ideal level of a subordinate art as athing in itself is at odds with its idealapplication by the statesman’s art.The Chimæra: Yes, and there’s more to it than that. If there is an idealstandard or level for both component artsand the statesman’s art, then the maintenance of that standard or level over aperiod of time should ensurecontinuous and ideal prosperity for the state as a whole, correct?The Sphinx: Theoretically, yes.The Chimæra: But conditions outside that state will vary. A neighboring statemay go to war against it, forexample.The Sphinx: That would necessitate an alteration of certain component arts -such as materiel production,resource allocation, and military activity - by the statesman, if he is toperform his ideal role.The Chimæra: But this means exceeding or falling below the ideal standards ofthe individual component arts. Inother words, the ideal standards of a component art by itself and the ideallevel of that art as a factor in the- 18 -overall community do not coincide. Therefore, if Plato insists upon absolutestandards, he places hisstatesman in the position of having to continuously violate the absolutestandards of component arts for thesake of his own art.The Sphinx: I suppose Plato would argue that the ideal standards of thecomponent arts would includeconsideration for the proper level of those arts within the community as awhole.The Chimæra: That still begs the question. The posture of the community mustchange as its externalenvironment changes. Therefore the component arts will be subject to continuousrevision of their levels ofactivity and emphasis. They become factors relative to the community, just asthe community becomes afactor relative to its external environment. Q.E.D.The Sphinx: So Plato’s definition of statesmanship is valid only if both thatart and the subordinate arts areassumed to be variable and relativistic. How intriguingly Sophistic!The Chimæra: ... All of which brings us back to the basic “relativity vs.absolutism” issue between [what Platowould call] Sophistry and Philosophy respectively. In a purely practical sensewe cannot continue to usethose terms as Plato did, because “sophistry” now conveys the image ofcharlatanism, while “philosophy”embraces relativistic as well as absolutist theories.The Sphinx: True. The basic issue still remains, but the old labels are nolonger accurate. Why do you supposePlato felt so strongly that absolute standards (Forms) existed?The Chimæra: It probably started with what he believed to be common sense. Oursenses seem to tell us that theworld around us is made up of reliable and permanent phenomena. A chair can becounted upon to remaina chair, a desk a desk. The Sun and the planets behave regularly. Relativismcarried to its logical conclusionwould deny these things. How could the Sophists say that “man is the measure ofall things” as they walkedabout on the solid and permanent ground of Greece? Man cannot decide that theground will be there oneminute and transmute into water the next. Plato must have felt that he wasarguing a case for the way thingsactually are, even if he encountered difficulties in justifying that positionlogically.The Sphinx: To be quite precise, a chair does not remain a chair or a desk adesk. Both are undergoing continuousmolecular breakdown, which is not apparent to humans because they normallyexperience sensory input ata relatively swifter rate. Nor are astronomical bodies truly constant; they onlyseem that way, again becauseof the relative differences in their rates of change and in human perceptivepowers. At the other end of thescale, there are phenomena that occur too swiftly for human senses to registerthem. So they seem“instantaneous”. So how dependable is Plato’s “actual world”?The Chimæra: I am tempted to say that, relatively speaking [from the human pointof view], the world appears toadhere to absolute laws.The Sphinx: Now that is an interesting statement! You mean that the humanability to perceive relative changeexists in a comparatively small range, and that phenomena changing at ratesbeneath or above that rangeappear to be instantaneous or permanent, as the case may be.The Chimæra: I suppose so.The Sphinx: Can we not identify anything that is truly permanent? That is infact absolute and not relative?The Chimæra: That was Einstein’s problem. He was able to postulate only onething that was absolute - the speedof light. But in that he was wrong.The Sphinx: Wrong? Kindly explain!The Chimæra: We run the risk of straying rather far from The Statesman.The Sphinx: But not from our ultimate topic. Remember that we are trying to geta grip on true conceptualanalysis, and to do that we had better resolve this relative/absolute issue onceand for all. According to thePlatonic school of thought, political science has an absolute standard, just asphysical laws do. That is theargument of The Statesman. So now we have said that Einstein reduced physics toonly one absolute - thespeed of light - and you dispute even that. I for one consider a resolution ofthis germane. If you destroyabsolutism in the physical world, then the basis for attempting to parallel the“absolute physical world” withan “absolute political world” disappears altogether. So proceed.- 19 -The Chimæra: All right. According to Einstein’s second fundamental postulate ofthe Special Theory of Relativity,the velocity of light is always constant relative to an observer, no matter howfast the observer and the lightsource may be separating or converging. A derived equation states that, when anobject is moving withrespect to an observer, the mass of the object becomes greater, the amount ofincrease depending upon therelative velocity of object and observer. As the mass of the object increases,its length along the axis of itsdirection will decrease. At the speed of light, the object’s mass becomesinfinite, and its length shrinks tozero. Since an infinite-plus amount of energy would be required to raise thespeed of an infinite massbeyond the speed of light, such hyper-light speed is not possible.The Sphinx: So states the Special Theory.The Chimæra: Now, internally the Special Theory is consistent, because it treatsthe speed of light as a constantand incorporates a series of equations which rely upon that constant and areconsistent with one another.As the Special Theory applies to phenomena which are substantially below thespeed of light, it is practical.The interrelationship of mass and energy relative to 186,000 miles per second(the Einstein speed of lightconstant) has been formulated as E=mc2 and put into practice through nuclearfission.The Sphinx: Where, then, lies the fault?The Chimæra: The Achilles’ Heel of the Special Theory is that, while applyingthe principle of relativity toeverything else except the speed of light, it thereby treats the speed of lightas an exception to the rule. Anexception to a rule of physics is an indication that the rule is inadequate tocover all known phenomena.Einstein’s decision to treat the speed of light as a constant was based upon thedifference between the speedof light and non-light-wave-related phenomena being so vast as to makesub-186,000 mps light speedimpossible to detect; and also upon the inability of science to detect anythingtraveling faster than 186,000mps.The Sphinx: Why this emphasis upon the word “detect”?The Chimæra: Detection and existence are two different things, and thatdifference is crucial to my argument.Now consider this hypothesis: If light waves from a stationary source travel at186,000 mps, and those lightwaves are the only means an observer located elsewhere has for detection of thatsource, what wouldhappen if the source were to begin moving away from the observer at 186,001 mps?Those light waves thatare the sole source of the observer’s information would no longer reach thatobserver. The waves are nowreceding from him at 1 mps. As far as the observer can detect, the light-sourcevanished when its speedexceeded the speed of light. But did the source in fact cease to exist? It didnot. [And its presence may bedetectable by observing warps in radiation waves and emissions affected by it -a possible explanation of the“black hole” phenomenon.]The Sphinx: What about light-sources that are proceeding in directions otherthan diametrically away from anobserver?The Chimæra: As for an object approaching an observer at 186,000+ mps, it wouldarrive before it could bedetected at any distance as a moving object, because humans do not possessinstruments that can identifyapproaching light speeds in excess of 186,000 mps - which would be the onlymeans of identifying theobject’s approach. If the source were to proceed at a tangent to an observer, itwill seem to compress as itapproaches the speed of light. The explanation for this illusion is morecomplex, but I may approximate itby saying that the lateral movement/oscillation of the emitted light waves isless detectable as the lateralspeed of the object approaches 186,000 mps. At 186,000 mps the waves are nolonger detectable as waves -merely as radiation; hence the illusion that the source has transmutated frommatter to energy.The Sphinx: In fact, then, the Special Theory contains its own invalidation. Itstates that everything is relative, butit cannot exist as a formula without at least one absolute constant - which,upon examination, proves to berelative itself. Which leaves only one question: If it is wrong, why does E=mc2work?The Chimæra: Because the values which are plugged into that formula are so farbelow 186,000 mps that thespeed of light might as well be treated as a constant. For equations thatinclude values closer to 186,000mps, the formula becomes increasingly less accurate. Hence the preposterouscalculation that a mass at186,000 mps becomes infinite. That is simply the result of the formula’sintrinsic distortion.The Sphinx: This is all very unsettling. So everything is relative?- 20 -The Chimæra: Let’s not jump to conclusions. Remember what we decided concerningPlato’s own proof ofabsolute Forms?The Sphinx: Yes. I referred to the Platonic Academy’s inscription Let no oneignorant of mathematics enter here,and then I said:Plato saw in mathematics unshakable evidence that there was an absolute standardfor theUniverse. And where one such standard existed, it was logical to assume thatthere were others.Today humans regard mathematics principally as an applied science, but inPlato’s time it wasconsidered by the Pythagoreans to be “pure”, having nothing to do with the grossand imperfecteveryday world.The Chimæra: Would you care to elaborate upon that?The Sphinx: The best thing to do is to quote directly from Thomas Stanley’s 1687account of the Pythagoreandoctrines, which draws its material from Porphyrus, Iamblicus, Strabo, etc. TheStanley text materializes,and the Sphinx turns to Part IX page #522. Consider the following: [sic]The mind being purify’d [by Discipline] ought to be applied to things that arebeneficial; these heprocured by some contrived ways, bringing it by degrees to the contemplation ofeternal incorporealthings, which are ever in the same state; beginning orderly from the mostminute, lest by thesuddenness of the change it should be diverted, and withdrew itself through itsgreat and longpravity of nutriment.To this end, he first used the Mathematical Sciences, and those Speculationswhich are intermediatebetwixt Corporeals and Incorporeals, (for they have a Threefold Dimension, likeBodies, but theyare impassible like Incorporeals) as Degrees of Preparation to the Contemplationof the things thatare; diverting, by an artificial Reason, the Eyes of the Mind from corporealthings (which never arepermanent in the same manner and estate) never so little to a desire of aliment;by means whereof,introducing the contemplation of things that are, he rendered men truly happy.This use he made ofthe Mathematical Sciences.These Sciences were first termed μάθημα by Pythagoras upon consideration thatall Mathesis(discipline) is Reminiscence, which comes not extrinsecally to souls as thephantasies which areformed by sensible objects in the Phantasie; nor are they an advantageousadscititious knowledg,like that which is placed in Opinion; but it is excited from Phænomena’s, andperfected intrinsecallyby the cogitation converted into it self.The Chimæra: How very interesting. It would seem that the recollective basis ofknowledge, heretofore assumedto be a Platonic concept, is in fact Pythagorean.The Sphinx: And the use of mathematics as a key to this particular sort ofknowledge, i.e. of the Forms.The Chimæra: Who is this Stanley, and how reliable can he be considered to be?The Sphinx: Thomas Stanley graduated from Cambridge at age 16 as a Master ofArts. He practiced law; was fluentin French, Italian, Spanish, and the Classical languages; and issued the firstvolume of his famous History ofPhilosophy when he was only 30. The three paragraphs cited above are allfootnoted to original Greeksources.The Chimæra: So Plato used mathematics as a “place to stand”, in an effort tomake the Universe intelligible byreason alone. And Platonists tend to emphasize this, shielding Plato from thedespised title of “mystic”. Seehere: He indicates page #xv in the Collected Dialogues .[Huntington Cairns:] But the difference between Plato and the mysticism that hasattached itself tohis philosophy is essential. Plato’s aim is to take the reader by steps, with assevere a logic as theconversational method permits, to an insight into the ultimate necessity ofReason. And he neverhesitates to submit his own ideas to the harshest critical scrutiny; he carriedthis procedure so far inthe Parmenides that some commentators have held that his own doubts in thisdialogue prevail overhis affirmations. But the beliefs of mystics are not products of criticalexamination and logicalclarification; they are, on the contrary, a series of apprehensions, flashes,based on feeling, denyingthe rational order. The mystic’s reports of his experiences are beyonddiscussion inasmuch as theyare subjective and emotional; they must be accepted, by one who wishes tobelieve them, as a matter- 21 -of faith, not knowledge. Plato’s view of the world is that of an intelligiblesystem that man can knowby disciplined intellect alone. He was, in fact, the founder of logic, alogician and a poet, but he wasnot a mystic, he never exalted feeling above reason.The Sphinx: Well, well. What do you think Cairns would say to the followingquote from The Statesman? He turnsto page #1082.STRANGER: When there arises in the soul of men a right opinion concerning whatis good, just, andprofitable, and what is the opposite of these - an opinion based on absolutetruth and settled as anunshakable conviction - I declare that such a conviction is a manifestation ofthe divine occurring ina race which is in truth of supernatural lineage.YOUNG SOCRATES: It could not be more suitably described.The Chimæra: (dryly) He would probably say that, since sphinxes and chimæras donot really exist, nothing wesay is to be taken seriously.The Sphinx: So, where Plato is concerned, a great deal hinges upon the basis formathematics itself. Is it acquiredthrough reason or through mystical vision, so to speak?The Chimæra: This is rather curious. Plato actually sets his dialectic processin contrast to mathematics, almostas though the object of the Dialogues is to arrive at a Form greater than thatof mathematics. He turns topage #746.I understand, he said, not fully, for it is no slight task that you appear tohave in mind, but I dounderstand that you mean to distinguish the aspect of reality and theintelligible, which iscontemplated by the power of dialectic, as something truer and more exact thanthe object of the so-called arts and sciences whose assumptions are arbitrary starting points. Andthough it is true thatthose who contemplate them are compelled to use their understanding and nottheir senses, yetbecause they do not go back to the beginning in the study of them but start fromassumptions youdo not think they possess true intelligence about them although the thingsthemselves areintelligibles when apprehended in conjunction with a first principle. And Ithink you call the mentalhabit of geometers and their like mind or understanding and not reason becauseyou regardunderstanding as something intermediate between opinion and reason.The Sphinx: It’s all very well for Plato to say that, and I’m sure thatdialecticians are not displeased to considerthemselves more intellectual than mathematicians. Yet we have found, in both TheSophist and TheStatesman, that Plato cannot proceed with his arguments unless he assumes thedivinely-inspired ability toperceive not only greater, but absolute perfection when he is confronted withit. That is not reason; it isrevelation. Plato does mathematics an injustice: While mathematicians openlyadmit that theirconclusions are originally based upon assumptions (axioms), Plato pretends thathis are not. And of coursethey are. Just as Einstein required a concrete assumption - a constant speed oflight - upon which to buildhis mathematical philosophy, so Plato must have an assumption - the ability torecognize absoluteperfection - upon which to build his dialectic philosophy.The Chimæra: Plato seems to be caught in a trap between the relativisticSophists on one hand - who denied thereliability of intuitive assumptions - and the Pythagoreans on the other - whopermitted originalassumptions via revelation/intuition. Plato rejects the notion that axioms arenecessary for reason, yet hecannot reason without them. No wonder he was so touchy about the Sophists.The Sphinx: Note the very precise manner in which the Pythagoreans discussed theoriginal assumptions ofmathematics: Again he indicates page #522 of the Stanley text.The whole science of Mathematicks, the Pythagoreans divided into four parts,attributing one toMultitude, another to Magnitude; and subdividing each of these into two. ForMultitude eithersubsists by it self, or is consider’d with respect to another; Magnitude eitherstands still, or ismoved. Arithmetick contemplates Multitude in it self: Musick with respect toanother: Geometry,unmoveable magnitude; Sphaerick, moveable.These Sciences consider not Multitude and Magnitude simply, but in each of thesethat which isdeterminate: for Sciences consider this abstracted from infinite, that they maynot (in vain) attemptin each of these that which is infinite. When therefore the wise persons saythus, we conceive it isnot to be understood of that multitude which is in the sensible thingsthemselves, nor of that- 22 -magnitude which we perceive in bodies, for the contemplation of these I thinkpertains to Physick,not to Mathematick. But because the Maker of all things took Union and Division,and Identity, andAlterity, and Station and Motion to compleat the soul, and framed it of thesekinds, as Timæusteacheth, we must conceive that the Intellect, consisting according to thediversity thereof, and thedivision of proportions and multitude, and knowing it self to be both one andmany, proposethnumbers to it self, and produceth them and the Arithmetical knowledg of them.According to theunion of multitude and communication with it self, and colligation, it acquirethto it self Musick: forwhich reason Arithmetick excels Musick in antiquity, the soul it self beingfirst divided by theMaker, then collected by proportions. And again establishing the operationwithin it self, accordingto its station, it produceth Geometry out of it self, and one figure, and theprinciples of all figures,but according to its motion, Sphaerick: for she is moved by circles, butconsists always in the samemanner according to the causes of those circles, the straight and the circular:and for this reasonlikewise Geometry is precedent to Sphaerick, as Station is to Motion.But forasmuch as the Soul produced these Sciences, not looking on the excitationof Ideas, which isof infinite power, but upon the boundure of that which is limited in theirseveral kinds, thereforethey say that they take infinite from multitude and magnitude, and areconversant only about finite:for the mind hath placed in her self all principles both of multitude andmagnitude, because beingwholly of like parts within her self, and being one and indivisible, and againdivisible, and producingthe world of Ideas, it doth participate essential finiteness and infinitenessfrom the things which itdoth understand: But it understands according to that which is finite in them,and not according tothe infiniteness of its life. This is the opinion of the Pythagoreans, and theirdivision of the fourSciences. Hitherto Proclus.The Chimæra: In the final analysis, whether Cairns would enjoy the idea or not,Plato must be classed with thePythagoreans as a “mystic”, in that he assumed that humans possess asupernatural power beyond reason torecognize perfection/ absolute Forms.The Sphinx: Yes. The Sophists were the only ones who could claim to be“non-mystics”, because they would notadmit to revealed accuracy of any sort. Plato tried to strike a balance betweenthe Sophists and thePythagoreans, but there is just no halfway position that holds water. ThePythagoreans would have beenamused by Plato’s laborious argumentative process, holding it to be a waste oftime, in that the final answerto a given problem could be known only by revelation/recollection. As for theSophists, they would havefaulted Plato’s arguments by denying the primary assumptions/revelations inthem.The Chimæra: All of which leaves us where?The Sphinx: Well, I think we have pretty well finished with The Statesman. Butour discussion concerning thePythagorean aspects of “Plato’s” philosophy raises yet another question: To whatextent was Plato anoriginal thinker?The Chimæra: On that thorny little problem I will let you take the lead.The Sphinx: I think we would be wise to start with some observations about time- not just the way most humansregard it, but the way Plato himself perceived it. I recall a pertinent commentof G.J. Whitrow’s in his bookThe Nature of Time:The first question to consider is the origin of the idea that time is a kind oflinear progressionmeasured by the clock and the calendar. In modern civilization this conceptionof time so dominatesour lives that it seems to be an inescapable necessity of thought. But this isfar from true ... Mostcivilizations, prior to our own of the last two or three hundred years, havetended to regard time asessentially cyclic in nature. In the light of history, our conception of time isas exceptional as ourrejection of magic.The Chimæra: Well said. Modern academicians are conditioned to an essentiallyNewtonian attitude towardstime. They regard it as a simple progression of events. The past may be referredto, and visions of the futuremay be projected, but neither past nor future has any intrinsic effect upon thepresent - nor do they existobjectively at all.The Sphinx: In a cyclical system of time, by contrast, past, present, and futurewould all be part of a singlecontinuum. This wouldn’t necessarily mean that “history repeats itself” either.Rather the components offourth-dimensional existence would continue to exist, although they might beundergoing periodicrearrangement and recomposition. One might draw an analogy to theinterchangeability of matter and- 23 -energy; a seemingly-endless variety of transmutation takes place, but the “sumof the whole” remains thesame.The Chimæra: Take the Platonic notion of the transmigration of souls. Itwouldn’t make much sense if entirelynew souls could come into being “out of nothing”, would it? Yet thetransmigration theory has beenridiculed on the grounds that (a) world population is expanding, and (b) pastincarnations have not beenrecalled to standards of scientific proof. If “the stuff of which souls aremade” can transmutate from othercomponents of a unified time-continuum, then the first objection disappears. Andlimited recomposition[short of transmutation] would account for the second.The Sphinx: And this would put the concept of the recollective basis ofknowledge in a new light as well. Instead ofknowledge being cumulative or progressive [again a purely-linear concept] withthe linear “passage” of time,it can be considered “circular” - rearrangements and recombinations of certainall-inclusive principleswhich are part of the cyclical continuum, i.e. “timeless”.The Chimæra: A provocative way of approaching the Theory of the FormsThe Sphinx: Let us try to “clear the air” of modem presuppositions and placeourselves in the time-environmentthat Plato himself perceived. As he looked at the world around him and observedchanges taking place,wouldn’t linear time have seemed obvious to him? Within the scope of his ownconsciousness, for example,he could tell that things “weren’t the way they used to be” and that new eventswere regularly taking place.The Chimæra: On a small scale, yes. But, seen at the “Forms level”, variousevents could be viewed asmodifications of a single Form of political behavior or as more complexcombinations involving more thanone Form. Thus the conquest of Athens by Sparta or the conquest of Sparta byAthens were essentiallyvariations on the same Form [of conquest], distinguished by variableapplications of other Forms [such aseconomic pressures, military power, political imperialism, etc.]. Viewed in thiscontext, events could indeedbe considered cyclical.The Sphinx: Well, have we justification to presume that Plato truly thought inthat context? After all, it is aperspective so broad that it could have been attacked as useless for concreteapplications. In point of factthis was the basic Sophist criticism of Plato - that his philosophy, while itmight be true on a macrocosmicscale - was of no help to people who were trying to solve immediate problems. Sothe Sophists advocatedproblem-solving techniques that ignored macrocosmic Forms.The Chimæra: In the Republic, Laws, arid Statesman we have three attempts byPlato to make his politicalphilosophy relevant. But it would be a mistake to say that he merely attemptedto “scale down” this Form orthat Form to a problem-solving level, in order to compete with the Sophists. AForm is not that sort of“thing”; it is not an axiom which can be applied to various problems. Rather itis a sort of sum-total ofidentifying characteristics in various phenomena which relate them, as sphinxesand chimæras arevariations of the Form “mythical beast”.The Sphinx: Speak for yourself. But we have now reached a point where we canexplore the development of Forms-theory prior to Plato’s time ... excuse me, Plato’s point of focus in thecontinuum. Because the Forms - andespecially the ones that were applicable to statesmanship - weren’t all thatnebulous. In fact they were theguiding principles of the most ancient civilization in the Mediterranean -andthe one with the most highly-developed political system as well. I am talking, of course, about Egypt.The Chimæra: The most highly-developed political system? You’re going to getsome objections on that score. Theaccepted impression of Egypt is that it was a simple military monarchy,reinforced by a death-obsessedreligion, which cared nothing for philosophy. I quote Bertrand Russell:Philosophy begins with Thales, who, fortunately, can be dated by the fact thathe predicted aneclipse which, according to the astronomers, occurred in the year 585 B.C.Philosophy and science -which were not originally separate - were therefore born together at thebeginning of the sixthcentury. 1The Sphinx: Bertrand Russell was ever quaint. “Sixth century” my claw! Forthirty recorded centuries beforeThales, Egypt had existed as a national system - not a mere city-state or evenfederation of city-states. It wasolder to the Greeks than the Greeks are to present-day humans. Scientifically itdeveloped architecture to a1 Russell, Bertrand, A History of Western Philosophy, page 3.- 24 -precision unapproached again until the present century [and in some aspectsstill unequaled]. 2 It developedelaborate, codified medical skills [including that of open-skull brain surgery]which were used with a highmeasure of success.3 It possessed the only accurate calendar in the entireMediterranean until the time ofJulius Cæsar [when Cæsar introduced a modified Egyptian calendar to the RomanEmpire]; the Egyptians’own records date back to 4241 BCE!4 And what of the hieroglyphic alphabet,introduced more than seventhousand years ago? 5The Chimæra: I expect that part of the problem lies in the fact that thealphabet you just mentioned was so veryhard to read. Indeed it was almost a sort of cipher used exclusively among theEgyptian intelligentsia.Training of a scribe took about twelve years, and even then a scribe was not ina position to understand thesignificance of most of the philosophical material he was recording. By Plato’stime other, less complexlinguistic systems had come into use for both reading and writing, and probablyno one in Athens couldread hieroglyphic, let alone gain access to philosophical texts hoarded by theEgyptian priesthoods. So it isnot so very surprising that Egyptian philosophy was not discussed by the Greeks,except for tourist-typeaccounts such as that of Herodotus and the Egyptian passage of Plato’s ownTimæus.The Sphinx: The last known use of hieroglyphic writing even in Egypt itself wasin 394 CE [on the Temple of Isis atPhilæ]. 6 Thereafter all knowledge of the language vanished from human knowledgeuntil Champolliondecoded the Rosetta Stone in 1822 CE. And only a small number of Egyptian textshave been translatedtoday -by a smaller handful of people who can read the language. So perhapsRussell’s statement can bepartially excused, if not condoned.The Chimæra: Then, too, Egypt has suffered a savage pillaging over thecenturies. As a symbol of “heathenpaganism” it was viciously despoiled by the early Christians and their Moslemsuccessors. Countless ancienttemples were either appropriated or razed by the Catholics, and thousands ofstatues and inscriptions weredisfigured. In 389 CE a Christian mob, acting on the orders of the ChristianRoman Emperor Theodosius,burned the great library of Alexandria to the ground. 7 Even so, millions ofbook-rolls were rescued orgathered together from other repositories and the library was reestablished -until 636. In that yearAlexandria was taken by Omar, the Third Caliph of Islam, who decreed: “Thecontents of these books are inconformity with the Koran or they are not. If they are, the Koran is sufficientwithout them; if not, they arepernicious. Therefore let them be destroyed.” They were burned as fuel to heatthe city’s baths; it took sixmonths for all of them to be consumed. 8 So it is not too surprising that modernresearchers have only apitiful few scraps of information from previously-undiscovered tombs oroverlooked monuments.The Sphinx: Before we explore the links between the Egyptians and Plato, it mayhelp if we bring out some of thesalient characteristics of the Egyptian political system. To begin with, it wascyclic rather than linear.Individual pharaohs and dynasties came and went, but the social system andpolitical structure remainedconstant. Each successive pharaoh, for example, was merely the momentarypersonification of a permanent,semi-divine entity that governed Egypt in the name of the gods. The nationitself was not viewed as merelyone in a series of political units located in northeast Africa; it had existedas a divine creation beforerecorded history, and it would continue to exist indefinitely. Various naturalcycles and human lifetimeswould impact upon it, but the essence of Egypt would remain untouched by[linear] time. 9 Consider, forexample, the following hieroglyphic inscription accompanying an image of thescarab-beetle Xepera,principle of cyclical regeneration and immortality:I was the spirit in the Primeval Waters. He who had no companion when his nameCame Into Being.The most ancient form in which I Came Into Being was as a drowned one. I was hewho Came Into2 Stecchini, Livio, “Notes on the Relation of Ancient Measures to the GreatPyramid” in Tompkins, Peter, Secrets of the GreatPyramid, pages 287-382.3 Cottrell, Leonard, Life Under the Pharaohs, pages 189-191.4 Casson, Lionel, Ancient Egypt, page 146.5 Ibid., page 141.6 Ibid.7 Tompkins, op. cit., pages 3-4.8 Berlitz, Charles, Mysteries from Forgotten Worlds, page 36.9 Compare this to the Chinese view of China as the “Middle Kingdom” ( Chhungkuo), the “focus” of civilization and creativity.- 25 -Being as a circle. He who was the Dweller in his Egg. I was the one who beganeverything, theDweller in the Primeval Waters. First the Wind emerged for me, and then I beganto move. I createdmy limbs in my glory. I was the maker of myself; I formed myself according to mydesire and inaccord with my heart. 10The Chimæra: If each pharaoh were held to be divinely-appointed, what was theactual selection procedure? Andhow could a human-supervised selection procedure retain credibility as a divineprocess?The Sphinx: It compares rather intriguingly with the system for selection ofphilosopher-kings in the Republic.During stable dynasties new pharaohs were selected from among the male offspringof the late pharaoh.There was more latitude in this process than one might think, because (a)pharaohs generally had manywives and concubines, resulting in scores of children, and (b) the education andselection of pharaohs werehandled by colleges of priests, themselves detached from the secular governmentbut exercising a sort ofguardianship over it. Unsuitable princes were either diverted to harmlesscareers or simply assassinated.With the exception of a few temporary puppet-kings or usurpers, then, Egyptianmonarchs were generallypriest-kings [an intentional reference to the Atlantean tern in the Critias] ofexceptional calibre. Incumbentpharaohs who began to behave in maverick fashion [such as Akhenaten, themonotheist mystic of the XVIIIDynasty] were also assassinated with the tacit consent of the priesthood. Thismethod of “impeachment”does not seem to have been abused, because an attack on the divine pharaoh forpurely-partisan motiveswould have been thought extremely ill-omened. Only for an obvious betrayal ofthe pharaoh’s sacred trust -as determined by the priesthood - could assassination be contemplated.The Chimæra: What sort of legal system did the Egyptians have?The Sphinx: Now we enter some particularly interesting territory from a Platonicstandpoint. As far as can bededuced from surviving records, bureaucratic and judicial affairs were notconducted according to acentralized legal code superior to the judgment of individual officials. Suchofficials were given a more-or-less free hand within their respective areas of responsibility - contingent, ofcourse, upon the maintenanceof order, payment of taxes, and general preservation of a harmonious attitudeamong the people. Therewere no legislated standards of good and evil/right and wrong. Justice was metedout ad hoc according toeach supervisory official’s concept of fairness and equity. The Egyptians prizedthis system very highly; itwas personified by the goddess Maat. When an Egyptian died, a feather fromMaat’s crown would beweighed against his heart to determine whether he would be granted a pleasantrepose in Amenti or be tornlimb from limb by monsters from the Tuat. I expect that would-be crooks wereinhibited accordingly, sincethe Egyptian religion was taken quite literally. Consider the followinginscription, dating from one of theearliest Old Kingdom dynasties of Egypt [and compare it to the concept of Tao]:If thou art a leader who directs the affairs of a multitude, strive after everyexcellence until there beno fault in thy nature. Maat is good, and its worth is lasting. It has not beendisturbed since the dayof its creator, whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished. It liesas a path even in frontof him who knows nothing. Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port.It is true that evilmay gain wealth, but the strength of truth is that it lasts; a man can say, “Itwas the property of myfather.” 11The Chimæra: A rather interesting contrast to the governments of Mesopotamia,Persia, and Greece, all of whichlaid stress upon codified law. I expect you are leading up to a comparison tothe Republic and Statesman,wherein Plato argues for specially-trained or specially-gifted rulers above thelaw. Are you going to suggestthat Plato took the Egyptian system as an ideal governmental model?The Sphinx: Let’s not jump the spear on this. I have a few other points to makeconcerning the Egyptian systemproper; then we’ll look into the matter of its actual links with Plato. Againbearing the recommendations ofthe Republic in mind, consider the following: Almost uniquely within the ancientworld, Egypt was freefrom hereditary caste, racial, or sexual discrimination in political affairs. Asocial aristocracy was created byproperty-inheritance, but a scion of poor or even unknown parentage might justas easily rise to high officeupon demonstrating suitable prowess. At various times the throne was held byNegroes, Persians,Mesopotamians, Greeks, and assorted Asians without racial objections beingraised. Women enjoyed thesame “citizenship” status as men, including choice of mate and inheritance ofproperty. Queens such asNefertiti and Ty wielded as much or more power than their consorts, and femalepharaohs such as10 Clark, R.T., Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt, page 74.11 Frankfort, Henri, Ancient Egyptian Religion, page 62.- 26 -Hatshepsut and Cleopatra ruled Egypt as decisively and with as much popularsport as did male pharaohs.Even in the Egyptian religious pantheon, gods and goddesses enjoyed equalprestige.The Chimæra: To an observer this extraordinary flexibility and tolerance mightwell account for the staying-powerof the Egyptian system, in spite of the occasional invasions, occupations, andeven civil wars that took placethere. When the dust cleared, so to speak, the political and social institutionsremained intact.The Sphinx: Precisely. Egypt was no more a utopia than any other human-runsociety was, is, or will be. Therewere power-struggles, epidemics of corruption, popular revolts, and all therest. During the MiddleKingdom (2150-1792 BCE) a pessimistic Pharaoh Amenemhet I advised Crown PrinceSenwosret:Harken to that which I say to thee,That thou mayest be king of the earth,That thou mayest be ruler of the lands,That thou mayest increase good.Harden thyself against all subordinates.The people give heed to him who terrorizes them;Approach them not alone.Fill not thy heart with a brother,Know not a friend,Nor make for thyself intimates,Wherein there is no end.When thou sleepest, guard for thyself thine own heart;For a man has no people in the day of evil.I gave to the beggar, I nourished the orphan;I admitted the insignificant, as well as him who was of great account.But he who ate my food made insurrection;He to whom I gave my hand aroused fear in my heart. 12The Chimæra: But the institutions survived, and on the whole Egyptians were ableto boast of a far more stable,prosperous, and inspiring society than those of the other Mediterraneancountries. That is your point?The Sphinx: Yes. By contrast the Greece of Plato’s time was in pretty sorryshape. The various city-states couldn’teven maintain stable governments of their own, much less get along with eachother. Elitist systems such asthat of Sparta were vulnerable to tyranny by strongmen; democratic Athenssuffered from demagoguery anddictatorships. The much-vaunted philosophers were tolerated only as long as theywere not thought to beactual threats. When they were inconvenient, as Plato and Aristotle had occasionto observe, hemlock orbanishment awaited. Great principles of religion and/or philosophy wereridiculed in favor of Sophisticopportunism. Yet -and I think this is an important point - the Greeks haddemonstrated that they were quitecapable of high intellectual achievement. They had produced a number ofnoteworthy philosophers, artists,statesmen, architects, and military leaders. What they had not produced was astable cultural environmentin which such talent could be nurtured. In his politically-oriented dialogues,therefore, Plato sought asystem of government that could achieve this stability without being asdictatorial as, say, the Persian orAssyrian monarchies. In Egypt, if in fact he realized it, he had a near-exactfunctioning model of hisRepublic - and one which was working quite well.The Chimæra: ... If he realized it! So the problem is now to discover whatconnections, if any, Plato had withEgypt. Are the Dialogues of any help?The Sphinx: No, they aren’t. There are a very few passing references to Egypt,but nothing of any substance. Itwould be discouraging if it were not for the fact that the Pythagoreans aresimilarly ignored. That makes thesituation a bit suspect. If Plato’s links with Egypt are tenuous, his links withthe Pythagoreans are beyonddoubt. The geometric passages in the Timæus are virtually pure Pythagoreandoctrine. And, from a politicalpoint of view, the Pythagoreans represented the extreme of initiated elitismthat Plato juxtaposed toSophistry. To the Sophists, human values were purely relative to custom,convention, and practicalnecessity; to the Pythagoreans, values were eternal, unchanging, and universal -the “Platonic” Forms. Howis it that the Pythagoreans came to hold this point of view? Let us look toPythagoras himself for the answer.The Chimæra: Back to the Stanley text. I see that most of its biographicalentries concerning Pythagoras arefootnoted to Iamblicus, a fourth-century CE Neoplatonist, and from DiogenesLaertius, writing about a12 Fairservis, Walter A., The Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile, pages 98-99.- 27 -century earlier. Specific passages dealing with Pythagoras’ stay in Egypt arefootnoted to Porphyrus andClemens Alexandrinus as well. In Chapter III “How he travelled to Phœnicia” weread:He made a voyage to Sidon, as well out of a natural desire to the place itself,esteeming it hiscountry, as conceiving that he might more easily pass from thence into Egypt.Here he conferred with the Prophets, successors of Mocus the Physiologist, andwith others, andwith the Phoenician Priests, and was initiated into all the mysteries of Byblus,and Tyre, and sundryof the principal sacred institutions in divers other parts of Syria, notundergoing these things out ofSuperstition, as may be imagined; but out of love to knowledg, and a fear, lestany thing worthy tobe known, which was preserved amongst them, in the miracles or mysteries of thegods, mightescape him. Withal, not being ignorant, that the rites of those places werededuced from theEgyptian ceremonies, by means whereof he hoped to participate of the moresublime and divinemysteries in Egypt, which he pursued with admiration, as his Master Thales hadadvised him. 13The Sphinx: Two rather intriguing points - first that Mesopotamian initiatorypriesthoods were thought to becorruptions or derivations of their Egyptian counterparts, and secondly thatPythagoras undertook thisquest on the advice of Thales. Thales was reputed to have been born of aPhœnician mother, and it is more-or-less reliably established that he studied the science of geometry in Egypt.14 But please continueThe Chimæra: Here are some extracts from Chapter IV “How he travell’d to Egypt”:Antiphon, in his Book concerning such as were eminent for virtue, extolleth hisperceverance whenhe was in Egypt, saying, Pythagoras designing to become acquainted with theinstitution of theEgyptian Priests, and diligently endeavoring to participate thereof, desiredPolycrates the Tyrant towrite to Amasis King of Egypt, with whom he had friendship (as appears also byHerodotus) andhospitality, (formerly) that he might be admitted to the aforesaid Doctrine.Coming to Amasis,Amasis gave him Letters to the Priests, and going first to those of Heliopolis,they sent him to thePriest of Memphis, as the more ancient, which was indeed but a pretence of theHeliopolitans: [Forthe Egyptians imparted not their mysteries to every one, nor committed theknowledg of Divinethings to profane persons, but to those only who were to inherit the Kingdom;and, of Priests, tothose who were adjudged to excel the rest in education, learning, and descent.]From Memphis,upon the same pretence, he was sent to Thebes. They not daring, for fear of theKing, to pretendexcuses; but thinking, that by reason of the greatness and difficulty thereof,he would desist fromthe design, enjoyned him very hard precepts, wholly different from theinstitution of the Grecians,which he readily performed, to their so great admiration, that they gave himpower to sacrifice tothe gods, and to acquaint himself with all their studies, which was never knownto have beengranted to any forraigner besides. Clemens Alexandrinus relates particularly,that he was disciple toSonchedes, an Egyptian Arch-prophet.15The Sphinx: Again something catches my eye - that comment about Egyptianinitiation normally being reservedfor the pharaoh and the priesthood alone. In the Statesman Plato writes:For the priest and the diviner have great social standing and a keen sense oftheir own importance.They win veneration and respect because of the high tasks they undertake. Thisis shown in the factthat in Egypt none can be king unless he belongs to the priestly caste, and if aman of some othercaste succeeds in forcing his way to the throne, he must then be made a priestby specialordination. 16The Chimæra: Now how would Plato come to know that bit of information, unless hewere party to policies withinthe Egyptian priesthoods?The Sphinx: It is always possible that he heard it from the Pythagoreans,although it seems only incidental to thesort of doctrines that Pythagoreans would be inclined to discuss. So here we mayhave a link directlybetween Plato and the Egyptian initiatory orders. Continue with the materialfrom Stanley.13 Stanley, Thomas, The History of Philosophy, page 494.14 Asimov, Isaac, Asimov’s Biographical Encyclopædia of Science and Technology,page 2.15 Stanley, op. cit. , page 94.16 Plato, Collected Dialogues, page 1059.- 28 -The Chimæra:Diogenes saith, that whilst he lived with these Priests, he was instructed inthe Learning andLanguage (as Antiphon also affirms) of the Egyptians, and in their three kindsof writing, Epistolick,Hieroglyphick, and Symbolick; whereof one imitates the common way of speaking;the restallegorical, by Ænigms. They who are taught by the Egyptians, learn first themethod of all theEgyptian Letters, which is called Epistilographick; the second, Hieratick, usedby those who write ofsacred things; the last and most perfect Hieroglyphick, whereof one isCuriologick, the other,Symbolick. Of the Symbolick, one is properly spoken by imitation, another iswritten as it wereTropically; another on the contrary doth allegorize by Ænigms. For instance, inthe Kyriologick way,to express the Sun, they make a Circle; the Moon a Crescent. Tropically they doproperly traduce,and transfer, and express by exchanging some things, and variously transfiguringothers. Thus whenthey deliver the praises of Kings, in Theological Fables, they write byAnaglyphicks. Of the thirdkind, by Ænigms, let this be an example: All other Stars, by reason of theiroblique course, theylikened to the bodies of serpents, but the Sun to that of a Beetle, becausehaving formed a ball ofCow-dung, and lying upon its back, it rolls it about (from claw to claw.)17The Sphinx: Once again there is more here than meets the eye. It is possiblethat lamblicus or one of the othersources could have made up the other details of a trip by Pythagoras to Egypt,but here we seem to haveconclusive proof - both of the trip itself and of Pythagoras’ initiation. Forthe description given of theEgyptian linguistic system is in complete agreement with what has come to lightwith the discoveries ofChampollion and Young. 18 Stanley could not have known this, and it is highlyimprobable that Iamblicus orany of the other biographers could have known it either. Hieroglyphic writingwas a closely-guarded skill inEgypt, and, as we noted earlier, its teaching required many years of study.Pythagoras’ initiation seems allthe more probable.The Chimæra: Here is the concluding passage from the chapter:Thus being acquainted with the learning of that Nation, and enquiring into theCommentaries of thepriests of former times, he knew the observations of innumerable Ages, asValerius Maximus saith.And living admir’d and belov’d of all the priests and prophets with whom heconversed, he informedhimself by their means accurately, concerning every thing; not omitting anyperson, eminent at thattime for learning, or any kind of religious rites; nor leaving any place unseen,by going into which heconceived, that he might find something extraordinary. [For he went into theAdyta of theEgyptians, (and, as Clemens saith, permitted himself to that end to becircumcised) and learnedthings not to be communicated concerning the gods, mystick Philosophy.] Hetravelled to all thePriests, and was instructed by every one, in that wherein they were particularlylearned. In Egypt helived twenty two years, in their private sacred places, studying Astronomy andGeometry, and wasinitiated (not cursorily or casually) into all the religious mysteries of thegods. Lærtius saith, Hemade three Cups of silver, and presented them to each [Society] of the EgyptianPriests; which, aswe said, were three, of Heliopolis, Memphis, and Thebes. 19The Sphinx: It is perhaps worthy of note that the sources cited by Stanley livedat points of time when the bulk ofthe material from the library at Alexandria still existed. It is notunreasonable to assume that they wouldhave either taken or verified their accounts from such records as they couldread [in Greek if not inhieroglyphic] from that institution. At the time its prominence was unparalleledby any other literaryrepository in the Mediterranean, and it is hard to imagine scholars -particularly ones dealing with such asubject as this - bypassing it.The Chimæra: The highly-selective “clubs” or schools which Pythagorasestablished in Sicily and southern Italyseem to align more closely to the fashion of the Egyptian priesthoods than toschools of the Greek tradition.Stanley, quoting lamblicus, makes this point and hints that Pythagoras’ exactingmethods were not well-received:His country summoned him to some publick employment, that he might benefit thegenerality, andcommunicate his knowledge: which he not refusing, endeavored to instruct them inthe symbolical17 Stanley, op. cit., pages 494-495.18 Budge, Sir E.A. Wallis, Egyptian Language, pages 13-42.19 Stanley, op. cit. , page 495.- 29 -way of learning, altogether resembling that of the Egyptians, in which hehimself had beeninstituted. But the Samians not affecting this way, did not apply themselves tohim. 20The Sphinx: I think we have satisfactorily established the links betweenPythagoras and the Egyptian priesthoods.Now we must determine to what extent the Egyptian doctrines reached Plato,either directly or through thePythagoreans.The Chimæra: Stanley quotes the following passage from Porphyrus:Moderatus saith, That this (Pythagorick Philosophy) came at last to beextinguished, first, because itwas aenigmatical; next, because their Writings were in the Dorick Dialect, whichis obscure, bywhich means, the Doctrines delivered in it were not understood, being spuriousandmisapprehended, because (moreover) they who publish’d them were notPythagoreans. Besides,Plato, Aristotle, Speusippus, Aristoxenus, and Xenocrates, as the Pythagoreansaffirm, vented thebest of them, as their own, changing only some few things in them; but the morevulgar and trivial,and whatsoever was afterwards invented by envious and calumnious persons, tocast a contemptupon the Pythagorean School, they collected and delivered as proper to thatsect. 21The Sphinx: That certainly doesn’t appear to be too complimentary to Plato. Yetthe fact remains that thecosmological philosophy in the Timæus is indisputably Pythagorean, yet isnowhere credited by Plato to thePythagoreans or to Pythagoras himself. What of the Pythagoreans’ politicaldoctrines?The Chimæra: In The Genesis of Plato’s Thought, Alban D. Winspear summarizesthem succinctly, if lessexhaustively than Stanley:It is true that Pythagoras himself seems to have held no elective office in anyGreek state. Hisfunction was rather to organize political clubs which busied themselves withpractical politicalaffairs and developed a general intellectual apologia for aristocratic rule.[Quoting Iamblicus] The Pythagoreans met in caucuses and gave counsel aboutpoliticalaffairs. With the passage of time, it came about that the young men not onlytook the leadin domestic matters but in public too; they came to govern the city, forming agreat politicalclub. For they were more than three hundred in number.It is in this connection not without significance that Pythagoras himself held(according to oneauthority) [Stobæus] that all income should come from agriculture. Here we havea hint of thatsame prejudice against the merchants and the democracy, that defense of theposition of the landedproprietor which so constantly recurs in Greek idealistic thinkers.Once this point is understood, the philosophical teachings of the Pythagoreansbecome intelligible.A passage in lamblicus (which goes back to Aristoxenus) gives their point ofview very clearly, andwe must connect it with our previous discussion about the importance of theproblem of justice:Pythagoras thought that the most efficacious device for the establishment ofjustice was therule of the gods, and beginning with that he established the state and the laws,justice andthe just.In this interesting passage we have a long step forward in the theologizing ofthe concept of justice.The contemplation of divine things, thought the Pythagoreans, instructed byPythagoras himself,was useful for mankind. The reason was that we need a master, some rulingprinciple against whichwe do not dare to rise in rebellion, and this is provided by the divinity. Ouranimal nature, heargued, is subject to hybris and is diverse and chaotic, subject to control by avariety of impulses,desires, and passions. There must be a power which by its superiority and its“threatening eminence( epanastasis)” will introduce prudence and order into chaos. 22The Sphinx: Compare this notion of justice as a divine standard to the Egyptianconcept of Maat which wediscussed earlier. Here we find evidence of a Form discussed virtuallyidentically by first the Egyptians, then20 Ibid., page 496.21 Ibid., page 508.22 Winspear, Alban D., The Genesis of Plato’s Thought, pages 81-82.- 30 -Pythagoras, then Plato. It is something higher than law, higher than humanreason or learned wisdom - it isa “god” itself.The Chimæra: The actual characteristics of what are generally known as the“Egyptian gods” are far closer to thenotion of Forms than they are to the later pantheons of pagan cultures such asGreece, Rome, andScandinavia. A reading of Egyptian texts translated directly from thehieroglyphic will substantiate this. Inonly a very few legends [such as that of the death and rebirth of Osiris] do thegods assume humanbehavioral characteristics. In the vast bulk of the existing texts they are farmore abstract, having“personalities” that seem to overlap one another and symbolic attributes thatare difficult to identify interms of purely-human desires. Consider the following inscription from the tombof Rameses VI in thislight, noticing the overlap between Truth ( Maat) and Ra:Adoration to Truth. Salutation to thee, this Eye of Ra through which he livesevery day! They whoare behind the chapel fear her, the Brilliant One, She who comes out from thehead of him whomade her. On the Head Serpent, who comes out in front of him! Thou art thebrilliant eye who leadshim, the word of judgment of the One Whose Name Is Hidden, the victorious onebefore theEnnead, Lady of Fear, great of respect, Truth, through whom Ra is glorified, shewho appeases forhim the Two Lands by her decrees, she who speaks to the gods and chases awayevil, whoseabomination is sin, she who appeases the hearts of the gods! Thou art thebalance of the Lord of theTwo Banks, whose face is beautiful when Ra comes to his Truth, being gloriousthrough her. Thosein Busiris praise him through her, litanies are sung to him by the great godswhile she adores thepowers of the Two Chapels. He is glorious through her, more than the gods, inthis her name of theBrilliant One. Thoth brought her and reckoned her, the Established One, theBrilliant, the ReckonedOne, in this her name of the Ipet Serpent. He made her live as a Uræus in thisher name of Openerof the Ways, She who leads him on the ways of the horizon, in this her name ofLeader of Men. Heerected her on his head in this her name of Very Great Crown. 23The Sphinx: A passage such as this is quite impossible to explain in terms ofordinary human conventions andvalues. It certainly bears scant resemblance to the light, allegoricaladventures of later Mediterranean godsand goddesses. Yet to one versed in the language of the Egyptian priesthoods,its meanings are quite clear. IfPlato were an Egyptian initiate, one can see why he would dismiss conventionalmeans of reductionist logicas a means for comprehending the Forms.The Chimæra: We have seen definite evidence of Pythagorean doctrine in thePlatonic writings, and at thebeginning of this discussion we recounted Plato’s visit to the Pythagoreancenters in Italy and Africa from399 to 387 BCE. But are there any grounds to suppose that Plato received directinitiation at the hands of anEgyptian priesthood?The Sphinx: There are at least two indications that he did. First there is thefollowing passage from the Prefaces ofSt. Jerome [circa 340-420 CE], placed by order of Popes Sixtus V [1585-1590] andClement VIII[1592-1605] as introduction to the Bible:Pythagoras and Plato, those masters of the genius of Greece, visited as pilgrimsseeking afterknowledge and as humble disciples the sacerdotal college of the soothsayers atMemphis[ Memphiticos vates], preferring to be initiated with respect to the ancientdoctrines of that distantland, rather than impose on their country the yoke of their own ideas. 24The Chimæra: At the risk of belaboring the point, I again note that this passagewas written prior to the finaldestruction of the Alexandrian library and [possibly] such references to thematter as it may have containedfor scholars of the time.The Sphinx: For that matter, there may have been other sources available to St.Jerome which, for one reason oranother, have not survived to the present day. Our second bit of evidence comesfrom Proclus, who statesthat Plato was initiated in Egypt over a thirteen-year period by the priestsPatheneitb, Ochoaps,Sechtnouphis, and Etymon of Sebennithis. 2523 Piankoff, Alexandre (Ed.), The Tomb of Ramesses VI, page 321.24 “Taceo de philosophis, astronomis, astrologis, quorum scientia mortalibusutilissima est, et in tres partes scinditur. to dogmathnmeqodon, thn empeirian.

Hyeronomi,Prologus galateatus, in Bibl. saer.].25 Proclus, quoted in Christian, Paul, Histoire de la Magie, du Monde Surnaturelet de la Fatalité à travers les Temps et lesPeuples, page 88.- 31 -The Chimæra: Again we can indulge in a little detective-work. The names of thefirst three priests can be renderedprecisely in hieroglyphics; that argues for their authenticity. [The fourth canbe rendered onlyapproximately and thus is not conclusive.] The “thirteen-year period” happens tocoincide with the normaltraining time for an Egyptian scribe [to achieve full fluency in thehieroglyphic language]. As forSebennithis, it was the seat of the Egyptian government from 378 to 360 BCEunder Nekht-Hor-heb I, firstpharaoh of the XXX Dynasty. Hence it would have been both relatively secure froma political standpointand a logical place for Plato to seek Egyptian initiation.26The Sphinx: Talk about last-minute timing! In 340 BCE, after more than fourthousand years of native nationalrule, Egypt finally fell to a Persian army [which in turn fell to Alexander theGreat in 332]. Howsophisticated the Egyptian initiatory systems remained under purely-occupationalgovernments is open toquestion - as would be the willingness of Egyptian priests to initiateforeigners under such circumstances.Even Pythagoras’ initiation many years earlier seems to have occurred only aftersome arm-twisting byAmasis, himself a native Egyptian pharaoh and thus an initiate in his own right.A Persian or a Ptolemaicruler would not have had such leverage over the native priesthoods, nor theknowledge to judge whetherforced-instruction were in fact genuine. After Pythagoras and Plato the linkwith the Egyptian priesthoodswas broken. [This may very well account for the sharp distinctions between thePythagorean/Platonicdoctrines - with their apparent sophistication and seeming uniqueness - and thedecidedly-dilutedcommentaries (such as those of Aristotle) which trailed along after them.]The Chimæra: Having come this far, what may we conclude concerning Plato’slegacy?The Sphinx: He left two memorials: his writings and his Academy. The formercontain discussions of Forms [orEgyptian “gods”, if you will!] on an initiatory level, although they are alsouseful as exercises in ordinarylogic. The latter was, in effect, a Pythagorean school minus the strict personaland psychological disciplinethat Pythagoras thought important [and which contributed directly to the burningof Crotona and theslaying of Pythagoras himself - by outraged ex-students who had failed towithstand the pressure]. EvidentlyPlato thought that he could transmit the doctrines in an environment more suitedto Greece than to Egypt.And he was successful, at least to the extent that the Academy enjoyed a longand productive existence - andto the extent that his own writings were preserved for our consideration at thispoint in the time-continuum.He may have failed to provide the Greece of his own day with the sort ofenlightened government that hemight have preferred, but he had seen Pythagorean domination of Sicily and Italycome to grief. So perhapshe was not so anxious as some might suppose to duplicate the Pythagoreanexperiment in Greece itself.Whereas Pythagoras died a violent death and left none of his personal works forposterity, Plato lived a fulllife and left a rich heritage for scholars - and Initiates - of the future.That, certainly, is testimony to hiswisdom.The Chimæra: “The secret worship of the Logos in the cosmos, the divine spark inevery human form.” 2726 Brugsch-Bey, Heinrich, Egypt Under the Pharaohs, pages 450-451.27 Incantation, Raghavan Iyer to M.A. Aquino, 1975.- 32 -BibliographyAsimov, Isaac, Asimov’s Biographical Encyclopædia of Science and Technology.Garden City, New York:Doubleday and Company, 1972.Barker, Sir Ernest, Greek Political Theory: Plato and his Predecessors.

The fate of my Gifted race rests inbalance, and I shall not recant my Word, spoken to my High PriestMehenPetTha in old Khem and now again to you. Proclaim thenineteen Parts of the Word, and vanquish thus the feeble and corruptKeys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my true Word and noware an affront to me.I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe. I created HarWer that Imight define my Self. All other gods of all other times and nationshave been created by men. This you know from the first Part of myWord, and from my manifest semblance, which alone is not of Earth.Known as the Hebrew Satan, I chose to bring forth a Magus,according to the fashion of my Word. He was charged to form aChurch of Satan, that I might easily touch the minds of men in thisimage they had cast for me.In the fifth year of the Church of Satan, I gave to this Magus myDiabolicon, that he might know the truth of my ancient Gift tomankind, clothed though it might be in the myths of the Hebrews.Even you, who delivered the Diabolicon from Asia, did not know it forwhat it was. But he that I had fashioned a Magus knew, and hethought often of the Diabolicon as he guided the Church of Satan.Upon the ninth Solstice, therefore, I destroyed my pact with AntonSzandor LaVey, and I raised him to the Will of a Daimon, unboundedby the material dimensions. And so I thought to honor him beyondother men. But it may have been this act of mine that ordained his fall.Were I my Self to displace the Cosmic Inertia, I should be forced tobecome a new measure of consistency. I would cease to be One, for Ishould become All.To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to break his Self- referenceto the bounds in which his semblance must exist.[index-35_1.png]- 35 -I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore toAnton Szandor LaVey his human aspect and his degree of Magus inmy Order. Thus all may understand that he is dearly held by me, andthat the end of the Church of Satan is not a thing of shame to him.But a new Aeon is now to begin, and the work of Anton SzandorLaVey is done. Let him be at ease, for no other man has ever seenwith his eyes.In April of the common year 1904, I came forth in Africa as myOpposite Self and brought into being an Aeon to end the horrors ofthe stasis of the death-gods of men. This new Aeon was a Purification,to prepare men for that which would follow it.And Aleister Crowley received the Book of the Law, and my OppositeSelf declared him Magus of the Aeon.But HarWer, my Opposite Self, is a strange and fitful presence. I, Set,am my Self distinct from the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordered inand of my Self. HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos andcould achieve identity only by becoming what the Cosmic order wasnot. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a Void in which trueCreation could take form as Set.But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the Cosmic Inertia without havingto assume its place. And so HarWer must exist while Set exists.The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equinox of the common year1966, when HarWer and Set were fused as one composite being. Andso commenced the time of Set- HarWer - known as the Age of Satan -which was to bridge the expiring Aeon of HarWer and theforthcoming Aeon of Set.Truth there was in the words of my Opposite Self, but a truth evertinged with the inconsistency and irrationality of which I have spoken.And so the Book of the Law was confusion to all who came upon it,and the creative brilliance of the Magus Aleister Crowley was everflawed by mindless destructiveness. He himself could never understandthis, for he perceived HarWer as a unified Self. And so he wasperplexed by a mystery he could not identify.[index-36_1.png][index-36_2.png][index-36_3.png]- 36 -And I, Set, spoke too in the Book of the Law - “Aye! listen to thenumbers and the words -- “What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thouknow ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it.”And many of the Aeon of HarWer sought to read this but could not.Nor could the Magus himself, though he guessed rightly at itssimplicity. It was said that every number is infinite - hence eachnumber or sum of joined numbers became merely the correspondingletter.Even so the sequence remained unknown - and so, after its issue, tome as well. For, while I may pass free of the boundaries of time,memory of the future cannot exist.Now it has come to pass, and the Book of the Law is laid bare -Destined First Century heir - Aquino - breaking Keys by doctrinesAnton LaVey - great Magus of reconsecration coming Year Xeper -founding his rightful Priesthood - Set - true origin Volume AL.”Michael Aquino, you are become Magus V° of the Aeon of Set.I, Set, am come again to my friends among mankind - Let my greatnobles be brought to me.In Khem I remain no longer, for I am forgotten there, and my house atPaMat-et is dust.

During the Age of Satan I allowed thiscurious corruption, for it was meant to do me honor as I was thenperceived.But this is now my Aeon, and my pentagram is again to be pure in itssplendor. Cast aside the corruptions, that the pentagram of Set mayshine forth. Let all who seek me be never without it, openly and withpride, for by it I shall know them.Let the one who aspires to my knowledge be called by the nameSetian.I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward anannihilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid. And alone Icannot preserve my Elect, but I would teach them and strengthentheir Will against the coming peril, that they and their blood mayendure.

Now let theSetian shun all recitation, for the text of another is an affront to theSelf. Speak rather to me as to a friend, gently and without fear, and Ishall hear as a friend. Do not bend your knee nor drop your eye, forsuch things were not done in my house at PaMat-et. But speak to meat night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier.

And Ithink not of those who think not of me.The years of the Aeon of HarWer were confused, and I do not wishto think of them save as curiosities. But I wish to remember theChurch of Satan and the Magus of that Age.

Aquino VI°The Ides of March XL ÆS"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONFrom 1966 to 1975 CE there existed in the United States of America a mostsingular organization known as theChurch of Satan. Founded by Anton Szandor LaVey in the city of San Francisco, itespoused the social doctrine of“Indulgence”, challenging all creeds, cultures, and codes that seek virtuethrough abstinence from the pleasures ofmortal existence.In its formative years the Church of Satan took an essentially metaphoricalapproach towards the being fromwhom it took its name. “Satan” was a term representing, it was thought, simplythe principle of carnality. Suchrituals and ceremonies as the Church first celebrated, therefore, were conceivedas illustrative, inspirational, andallegorical. That, at least, is the way it all began.“When he is called,” Eliphas Levi once observed, “the Devil comes and is seen.”And in that prosaic statementlies a truth whose implications challenge the rational constructs of the mostexacting intellects. The one commonfeature to all the gods of all the nations of history, it may be said, is thatthey do not come and are not seen.Satan, however, did come to the Church of Satan - first as the faintest ofatmospheres in its ceremonies, andultimately as a metaphysical presence whose expression of being was awesome,exhilarating - the very fire of life tothose who took his name as a part of their own and called themselves Satanists.The full history of the Church of Satan is documented in The Church of Satan,which account culminates on theNorth Solstice of the Satanic Year Ten, the evening of June 21-22, 1975. For theChurch of Satan had fallen in ruins,Anton LaVey having corrupted the Priesthood; and it seemed to me, at that timeMagister Templi IV° and successorby default to the Satanic High Priesthood, that only direct intervention by thePrince of Darkness himself couldprovide us with a basis for a viable raison d’être.Alone that night I called upon him, and he came forth - through a sequence ofrealizations within my mind that,in a few short hours, I recorded in written text as The Book of Coming Forth byNight.In its most immediate sense this text brought the Church of Satan to a final,dignified terminus, superseding itwith a new initiatory institution - the Temple of Set - whose history to datemay be found in its variousadministrative papers, newsletters, and the Jeweled Tablets of Set. Yet the Bookof Coming Forth by Night was toprove a far deeper and richer mine, as again and again I strove to explore itsdepths. My first comment - a singlepage - was written on the morning of June 23, 1975. Over the following decadesgradually-expanding ones were tofollow, and finally this one.Since 1975 the Temple of Set has attained a far richer awareness of itsidentity. I myself grew to comprehend thefull meaning of the Word whereby I came into being as a Magus V°. In doing so Iaided others to attune theirmagical wills to ever more powerful sources of energy and inspiration that hadlain dormant within them. Havingfulfilled that which was set forth for me to do upon the Earth as a Magus, Imyself came into being on the Ides ofMarch XIV as an Ipsissimus VI°.This, then, is an examination of the Book of Coming Forth by Night from a VI°perspective, encompassing thekey magical texts of two Æons and their intervening Age. The Book of ComingForth by Night is no longer just a callto arms and a charge to the fellowship of the Prince of Darkness; it is aprinciple which has woven itself into thefabric of existence so thoroughly that it has become an immortal element ofmankind’s higher potential. It remainsfor those who seek the path to that towards which it shows the way to trainthemselves and refine their states ofbeing until this Grail appears in its truth before them. This commentary is aforetaste of the elixir of the Grail; it is tosay that Xeper is also no mere illusion - it too comes and is seen.To what extent does the text lend itself to objective interpretation? At firstreading it is both straightforward andunambiguous. Many of the words and phrases, however, are evidently used in anemphatically precise or uniquesense. A magician and philosopher will consider them with corresponding care.Moreover the Book of Coming Forthby Night is not simply a compendium of abstract generalizations; its appearancewas keyed to specificcircumstances, and many of its passages address them. Thus backgroundinformation is important, particularly forthose unfamiliar with the events and subjects in question.While the Book of Coming Forth by Night is sufficiently integral to be read andconsidered as a whole, itsstatements are best treated in sequence. Hence I begin as the text itself began:with its name.Xeper.- 40 -The Book of Coming Forth by Night (title)In hieroglyphics this would be Sat Per Em Kerh. It is an evident negation of thename of the Book ofComing Forth by Day, the Osirian funerary text that is popularly known as theEgyptian Book of the Dead.Persons unfamiliar with the ancient Egyptian culture often assume that theEgyptian religion, like thoseof later Mediterranean civilizations, consisted of a single, integrated pantheonof anthropomorphic godsand goddesses. It is rather the case that the earliest Egyptian god-figures wereprovincial, being patrons ofindividual cities and districts ( Nomes). Nor, despite their famous human/beastcomposite appearances,were they mere “supernatural persons” after the Greek, Mesopotamian, or Romanfashion. While popularstories were woven about them - presumably for popular consumption - thehieroglyphic treatment of theseentities suggests that they actually represented various aspects of existence -the “Forms” or “FirstPrinciples” discussed by Pythagoras and Plato in a more abstract manner.The hieroglyphic term for “god” is neter, of which Sir E.A. Wallis Budgeremarks:This word has been translated “godlike”, “holy”, “divine”, “sacred”, “power”,“strength”, “force”,“strong”, “fortify”, “mighty”, “protect”; but it is quite impossible to becertain that any word whichwe may use represents the meaning of neter, because no one knows exactly whatidea the ancientEgyptians attached to the word. The truth is that the exact meaning of neter waslost at a very earlyperiod of Egyptian history, and even the Coptic does not help us to recover it.28Commerce, protective alliances, cultural contact, and finally the unification ofthe entire nation ca. 3200BCE resulted in the gradual incorporation of local gods into regional groups,and then into a loosely-knitnational pantheon. Local and regional cult centers continued to hold theirrespective patrons in especialregard, however, and so the character and role of a specific god might varyremarkably from place to place.Individual dynasties also tended to be oriented to particular cult centers, andso the gods in question wouldbe elevated - at least for a time - to the status of national patrons.29The information concerning these cults which is available to modernEgyptologists is both sparse andconfusing. Since a given god could be portrayed in a number of different ways,identifying the “core god” isdifficult. The images and inscriptions concerning a god were often altered orappropriated by cultists of rivalgods.In Christian and Moslem times the old gods were considered blasphemous, andmonuments to themwere regularly defaced and destroyed. By the end of the fifth century CE,knowledge of hieroglyphics haddied out, not to reappear until the nineteenth century; meanwhile many “useless”records perished throughneglect.For two reasons the cult of Osiris ( Asar) and Isis ( Asa) has been emphasizedin modern literature: First,it was the last cult to dominate the entire Egyptian nation. Thus it was in aposition to do a “final editing” ofnon-Osirian manuscripts and monuments. Secondly it was described in detail byPlutarch, permitting itsstudy long after the hieroglyphic records of the other cults had becomeunreadable. 30 Observes Budge:In the early dynasties Set was a beneficent god, and one whose favor was soughtafter by theliving and by the dead, and so late as the XIX Dynasty kings delighted to callthemselves “Beloved ofSet”. After the cult of Osiris was firmly established and this god was the“great god” of all Egypt, itbecame the fashion to regard Set as the origin of all evil, and his statues andimages were soeffectively destroyed that only a few which have escaped by accident have comedown to us. 31The Osirians recast Set as Osiris’ treacherous brother and mortal enemy ofOsiris’ son - for whom theyappropriated the god Horus. Not content with attacking Set personally, theyfurther appropriated hisconsort and son from the original triad of his cult - Nepthys and Anubis - whomthey now describedrespectively as a concubine of Osiris and a son of Osiris by Nepthys.When the Osirian cult came to dominate Egypt after the XX Dynasty, all traces ofthe Set cult werepractically obliterated. “Between the XXII and the XXV Dynasties,” commentsBudge, “a violent reaction setin against this god; his statues and figures were smashed; his effigy washammered out from the bas-reliefs28 Budge, Sir E.A. Wallis, The Book of the Dead. New Hyde Park: UniversityBooks, 1960, page #99.29 Ions, Veronica, Egyptian Mythology. New York: Hamlyn Publishing Group, 1968,pages #11-13.30 Budge, Egyptian Language. New York: Dover Publications, 1971, page #15.Ions, op. cit., pages #50-55.Fagan, Brian M., The Rape of the Nile. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1975,pages #34-36.31 Budge, The Book of the Dead, page #181.- 41 -and stelæ in which it appeared.” 32 We know of the Set cult through a fewarchæological finds that managedto survive both the Osirian influence and the more general vandalism of theChristian/ Moslem eras. Henceit is no small irony that the Book of Coming Forth by Night plays upon the titleof the Osirian “bible”.It is also of note that the Osirian cult in particular glorifiedlife-after-death above life-before-death. TheBook of Coming Forth by Day is essentially a selection of spells andincantations designed to aid a newly-dead person through the perils of the underworld. This preoccupation with deathis conspicuously absentfrom the Book of Coming Forth by Night, which is ultimately an incitement to anda challenge for theenhancement of conscious life.North Solstice XeperThe Book of Coming Forth by Night was written during the night of the NorthSolstice (June 21-22)1975 (the year X of the Age of Satan, according to the Church of Satan). Herethe year is given thehieroglyphic name Xeper, symbolized by Xepera, the scarab beetle who representsthe principle of the Sun’s“immortality” via its transition through the darkness towards another dawn.As a god of darkness and night, Set was the complement to Horus ( Hor - god ofthe Sun and daylight) inpredynastic times. So integral was this relationship that the heads of the twogods were frequently shown ona single body (hieroglyphic name: Hrwyfy “He with the Two Faces”). With regardto the annual cycle,Horus was thought to govern the waxing of the Sun from the South Solstice, whileSet governed the waningof the Sun from the North Solstice. 33In The Dawn of Astronomy Sir Norman Lockyer suggests that “‘Set’ seems to havebeen a generic nameapplied to the northern (? circumpolar) constellations, perhaps because Set =darkness, and these stars,being always visible in the night, may have in time typified it. 34 Since thenorthern constellations weresymbolized by the name of Set, the god of darkness, we should take Set-Horus tomean that the stars in theDragon ( Draco) were rising at sunrise.” 35 To support his theory, Lockyer citesthe following inscription fromroyal tombs in the Valley of the Kings:The constellation of the Thigh appears at the late rising. When thisconstellation is in themiddle of the heavens, having come to the south where [the constellation Orion]lies, the other starsare proceeding to the western horizon. Regarding the Thigh: It is the Thigh ofSet; while it is seen inthe northern heavens, there is a band [constellation] to the two in the shape ofa great bronzechain. 36Lockyer concludes that the constellation Draco, and in particular the star atits head ( GammaDraconis), represented Set. If indeed a single star were so regarded, it wasprobably Alpha Draconis (orThuban), the Polar Star at the beginning of the Egyptian civilization.Due to the Precession of the Equinoxes, Alpha Draconis will return to thecelestial pole atapproximately 24000 CE. Since its last appearance there ca. 3000 BCE coincidedwith the unification anddevelopment of the world’s first advanced human culture, related calculationsbased upon the PrecessionCircle may yield interesting results. 37The Equinox has succumbed to my Solstice, and I, Set, am revealed in my Majesty.The apparent reference is to the North Solstice, as explained above. There maybe a second implication:Aleister Crowley identified the events surrounding the inception of the Æon ofHorus in 1904 CE as the“Equinox of the Gods”. The Book of Coming Forth by Night heralds the eclipse ofthat æon in favor of theÆon of Set.My evocation - an effort to interpret the surprising downfall of the Church ofSatan - was addressed to“Satan” (which I believed the proper name of the Prince of Darkness).Immediately, however, he correctsthis name to that of Set. The term “Majesty” is also significant; in Egypt thishonorific title was accorded32 Budge, The Mummy. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1973, page #276.33 Carus, Paul, The History of the Devil. New York: Land’s End Press, 1969, page#17.34 Lockyer, J. Norman, The Dawn of Astronomy. Cambridge: M.I.T.

In hieroglyphics it is the suffix -hen. A possiblephonetic origin of the Hebrewterm Satan is thus apparent. 38The time of the Purification is past.This period is not conclusively identified. It may refer to the Age of Satan(Set/HarWer), when all of theOsirian death-worship and posthumous salvation cults have undergone amore-or-less final archæologicalexposure and discrediting, despite lingering emotional enslavement to them ofprimitive intellects. Or itmay refer to the Æon of Horus (HarWer), during which time the grip of the oldcults on the human mindwas gradually broken. Or it may indicate the entire passage of time since theOsirian death-worship cultgained supremacy in Egypt and either absorbed or outlawed the life-orientedcults.The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance, and I shall not recant my Word,spoken to myHigh Priest MehenPetTha in old Khem and now again to you.The emphasized term “Gift” refers to the non-natural expansion of humanintellectual capacity thatoccurred in prehistoric times, as discussed in Black Magic and The Temple ofSet. “Word” refers to theWord of Set, discussed below.There are no records of the ancient Priesthood of Set through which “High PriestMehenPetTha” mightbe identified, but the name can be rendered in hieroglyphics. Ipsissimus DonWebb has observed:Mehen is the serpent-goddess whose “hidden” faces are those of Horus and Set.For informationon this, see my The Seven Faces of Darkness. 39 She was around from predynastictimes, but wasonly used in personal names during the Setian Renaissance according to GeorgeHart, when her cultgained a status among the tomb workers at S*t Maat - an area known for its Setchaplains and itsspecial devotion to Set Aaphate (“Set Strong of Foreleg”).40Mehen shows up in the funerary decorations of people like Rameses VI and Seti I.Dr. Aquinopointed out to me that she shows up in the Book of Gates after the Slaying ofApep.The other nouns in the name are a bound genitive (they mean “of”), which iscommon in anominative utterance. Pet is pretty simple: Heaven. There are several words thatsound like tha. Ofthe nouns I choose “fire”. My reasons are magical; pursuing Rev. 13:13 willsuggest them to you. 41So I would say “Mehen of Celestial Fire” is the name. 42“Khem” is a phonetic rendition of the hieroglyphic Xem, one of the many titlesof the ancient Egyptiannation.Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, and vanquish thus the feeble andcorrupt Keys ofEnoch, which were but a shadow of my true Word and now are an affront to me.On April 13, 1584 CE John Dee, mathematician and magician to the court of QueenElizabeth I,undertook a series of Workings in Cracow, Poland. With the assistance of EdwardKelley, he wrote into hisdiaries a series of nineteen magical incantations in what he called the“Enochian or Angelic language”. Witheach incantation or Key Dee provided an English translation, also communicatedby the angels to Kelley. In1659 the Dee diaries containing the Keys were published by Meric. Casaubon as ATrue and FaithfulRelation of What Passed for Many Yeers between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits. 43The attribution of the Keys or language to Enoch is interesting insofar as he isa remarkable individualin legend. Described in the Old Testament as the seventh master of the worldafter Adam, Enoch is theHebrew equivalent of the Phœnician Cadmus, the Greek Hermes, and the EgyptianThoth. As such he is thereputed author of the Tarot, the Cabala, the Emerald Tablet of Thoth, and theapocryphal Book of Enoch.He receives only a brief mention in “Genesis”, where the fifth chapter recounts:38 Ions, op. cit. , page #65.39 Webb, Don, The Seven Faces of Darkness.

The Apocalyptistswere a school of pre-Rabbinical Hebrews who believed that the world was in sucha hopeless mess as to beincurable by any of man’s efforts. The name “Apocalyptist” means “revealer”, andthis sect maintained thathuman progress was rigidly mapped by God and was not subject to human will atall. In this theApocalyptists differed from the other major Hebraic branch, Pharisaism.The Apocalyptic literature is generally fixed to the period 200-150 BCE, and theBook of Enoch isgenerally regarded as the oldest such work. It seems to have been written by anumber of authors, theearliest being a Hebrew from the Land of Dan in northern Palestine. The originaltext was probably writtenin Hebrew or Aramaic, later translated into Greek and Latin. These translationsdid not directly survive thedecline of the Holy Roman Empire. The Greek version had been translated intoEthiopian, however, and anexplorer named Bruce brought back a copy of it from Abyssinia in 1773 CE.The Book of Enoch is sometimes referred to as I Enoch to distinguish it from IIEnoch (or The Secrets ofEnoch), a later work executed in Slavonic. The Book of Enoch contains sixsections: The Book of Enoch, theParables, the Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries, the Dream-Visions,the Conclusion, and theNoah Fragments. Most are restatements of traditional Hebraic doctrine, but thefirst section - the Book ofEnoch - includes accounts of Enoch’s visits to certain areas of Earth and Sheol,including the followingdescriptions of the Palace of the Prince of Darkness:And I went in until I drew nigh to a wall which is built of crystals andsurrounded by tongues offire, and it began to affright me. And I went into the tongues of fire and drewnigh to a large housewhich was built of crystals. The walls of the house were like a tessellatedfloor of crystals, and itsgroundwork was of crystal. Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and thelightnings, and betweenthem were fiery Cherubim amidst a background of water. A blazing fire surroundedthe walls, andits portals were covered with fire. And I entered into that house, and it was ashot as fire yet as coldas ice. There were no delights of life therein. Fear covered me, and tremblinggat hold of me. And Iquaked and trembled and fell down upon my face.Shortly thereafter Enoch beholds the Black Flame:From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the Earth. And Isaw a burningfire which ran without resting, and paused not from its course day or night butblazed withoutrespite. And I asked, saying, “What is this flame which burns unceasingly?” ThenRaguel, one of theholy Angels who was with me, said, “This is the Dark Fire in the West whichpersecutes all theluminaries of Heaven.”In the “Conclusion” the coming of a new kingdom is predicted - not in anafterlife, but here on Earth.The destruction of the existing Earth and Heaven is foretold, followed by theinstitution of a “new Heaven”.The relevance of this Book of Enoch material to the deciphered “Enochian Keys”will become apparent.In the late nineteenth century the Casaubon text of the Enochian Keys wasadopted into the magicalinventory of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a London-based Rosicruciansociety. The GoldenDawn altered and augmented the Keys in order to align them with its own emphasison the Hebrew Cabala,and its publications assert a mastery of the Enochian language by the leaders ofthe Order. 44 AleisterCrowley later incorporated the Golden Dawn edition of the Keys into hisA.'.A.'., again claiming fluency inEnochian and constructing rituals from Enochian words and phrases. 45The Keys next appeared in 1969 CE, when Anton LaVey took the Cabalistic versionfrom Crowley’sEquinox, replaced references to the Judaic/Christian God with references toSatan, and included the resultin his Satanic Bible. 46 The general sensation caused by this book, togetherwith a considerable amount ofindignation on the part of old-line Cabalists, eventually inspired a revival ofinterest in John Dee and hismagical diaries. 47 In 1974 CE Stephen Skinner brought out a second (facsimile)edition of A True andFaithful Relation, a copy of which I acquired in March of the following year.44 Regardie, Israel, The Golden Dawn. St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1970,Volume II, pages #260-269.45 Crowley, Aleister, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley. New York: Hill &Wang, 1969, page #612.46 LaVey, Anton Szandor, The Satanic Bible. New York: Avon Books, 1969, pages#155-272.47 Regardie (Ed.) in Crowley, Aleister, The Vision and the Voice. Dallas:Sangreal Foundation, 1972, page #10.- 44 -Upon comparing the facsimile Casaubon to the Golden Dawn, Crowley, and LaVeyKeys, I realized theextent of the distortion that had taken place. Being familiar with language andcipher construction, I set outto unravel the original Keys to determine their linguistic lineage. After someweeks of work, I concluded thatEnochian is not a true language. Rather it is an artificial jargon, i.e.arbitrary words placed together inroughly consistent sequences to simulate a true language. It is so cleverly donethat it can fool non-linguistsfairly easily:We have here fragmentary pieces of a very ancient tongue - a language which isfar older eventhan the Sanskrit. 48Immediately after admitting that he is no philologist and is “without the leastscientific knowledge ofcomparative languages”, Regardie offers the above statement about Enochian -which may be discountedaccordingly.The story continues, however: Aleister Crowley included virtually the samesentence in his Confessions(page #612), again with no supporting evidence whatever.Then Anton LaVey, assuming that both Regardie and Crowley must have known whatthey were talkingabout, included virtually the same sentence in his Satanic Bible (page #155).Later attempts to validate Enochian as a language or to place it historically -Donald C. Laycock’s TheComplete Enochian Dictionary (London: Askin, 1978) and Geoffrey James’ TheEnochian Evocation of Dr.John Dee (Berkeley Heights, NJ: Heptangle Books, 1984) - have met with similarfailure. James, followingLaycock, reaches the conclusion that the unpronounceable words and random letterarrangements ofEnochian indicate that it was designed for non-material entities [lacking vocalcords]!The last word was written by Hans Holzer in his The Truth About Witchcraft(1969), in which he calledthe language “Inelkian” and labeled it “a form of distorted Hebrew”!It is even possible to “write” in Enochian as Crowley did, altering suffixes tocreate the impression ofdeclension or conjugation. But a comprehensive grammar, essential to a truewritten or spoken tongue, islacking.For an example of how a jargon may be used, see pages #181-201 of the SatanicRituals by AntonSzandor LaVey. Some years ago I ghostwrote the entire section on H.P. Lovecraft- introduction and rituals -for the book. It was the work of about two months to develop the jargon thatbecame the “namelesslanguage” [I called it “Yuggothic”] of the Ceremony of the Nine Angles and theCall to Cthulhu. A word thatsounded properly “Lovecraftian” would be constructed arbitrarily: El-aka =world, gryenn’h = [of] horrors.Then the word would be used consistently throughout the text of both rituals.Slight modifications ofendings would suffice for different sentence constructions, and there you have a“language” every bit asflexible as Enochian!49Once I realized Enochian to be a jargon, I changed my approach. Now I suspectedthat it might be somesort of cipher or code, Dee being famous for his use of same. I tested the firstthree Keys against a variety ofcode-breaking techniques. 50 Once more I met with no success. I had not heldhigh hopes that I would. Theloose alignment of Enochian words to their English counterparts, together withan entirely differentfrequency of individual letters in the two languages [even cancelling out themost divergent letters], makescipher improbable.Only pure code - with Enochian words or letters meaning something not revealedby their internaldesign alone - remained. To uncover such a code, one would simply have to knowthe words or phrases inEnglish triggered by a given Enochian word or phrase, unrelated though theconnection might otherwise be.[For example, the otherwise random appearance of “vorsg” might be code for “forthe Queen’s eyes only”,etc.]Two avenues of investigation remained. First, if it were true that Enochianwere neither language norcipher, then there was still the possibility that it might be a corruption of agenuine tongue. Regardie [citingMathers’ method], Crowley, and LaVey had all accepted Kelley’s comment that “Heseemeth to read asHebrew is read”. 51 I decided to eliminate this Hebrew-letter pronunciationentirely, treating each word as aphonetic unity and deemphasizing the vowels. [Thus “vorsg” should be pronouncedjust that way, ratherthan “vaoresaji”.]48 Regardie, The Golden Dawn, Volume II, page #266.49 See Appendices #72-74 of The Church of Satan.50 from my experience with the U.S. National Security Agency, concerned amongother things with cryptography.51 Casaubon, op. cit. , page #120.Crowley (Ed. Regardie), Gems from the Equinox. St. Paul: Lewellyn Publications,1974, page #408.- 45 -My test case was the XIX Key, 30th Æthyr (TEX) on the assumption that theremight be visual resultsper Crowley’s experiences in The Vision and The Voice. 52 This time there was acertain success, in that Iexperienced a sequence of unusual visions and dreams. 53Finally, during the evening of May 30, I experimented with the XVII Key and wasrewarded withspectacular results - the “Sphinx and Chimæra” Working.54Then, in the first week of June, something quite unexpected happened. I began towrite a text ininstallments of one or two hours per night. In the same style as the future Bookof Coming Forth by Night,it declared the Enochian Keys to be a remote corruption of something called theWord of Set. Therefollowed two “pure” Keys in English - called “parts” of the Word of Set. Beforeproceeding further I wasforced to break my concentration because of the sudden crisis in the Church ofSatan, and so the Word ofSet remained unfinished for the next six years.As to the “breaking” of the Keys “by the doctrines of Anton LaVey”, therein liesstill another tale.Anton’s principal contribution to the Crowley Keys was to render them in whatmight be called a “BlackMass” form, with Heavenly references arbitrarily changed to Infernal ones. Onemight presume that thiswould invalidate the statements of the text. Oddly enough, however, the use ofthese “Black Keys” by theChurch of Satan produced magical results that were, if anything, far morepowerful than those of the “pure”system.In my Working on the Word of Set, I used an approach similar to Anton’s, seekingwords to expresswhat I seemed to sense the Keys were actually intended to say. In short I wasendeavoring to present theKeys in a still “Blacker” version than that which appears in the Satanic Bible.Moreover the North Solstice X Working which resulted in the Book of Coming Forthby Night wasbegun with this new First Part of the Word of Set rather than with the FirstEnochian Key. Such would seemto be the basis for the Book of Coming Forth by Night’s reference to the“breaking” of the old Keys.Six years later the Working of the Word of Set was finally completed - on April13, 1981 (anniversary ofJohn Dee’s initial Working).In the Satanic Bible the Enochian Keys, even in their altered form, are stillgarbled and unintelligible.Hence Anton felt the need to venture an interpretation of each one preceding itstext. These interpretationshave no basis in previous documents, and indeed previous commentators -including Dee himself - hadbeen unable to integrate the Keys into a coherent translation.After completing the Working of the Word of Set, I found that the newtranslation needed no externalinterpretation - at least not for those to whom it was evidently addressed.Obviously it is idiomatic and not aword-for-word translation - as are all translations from original hieroglyphs.In 1980, furthermore, I learned that the Casaubon account of the Dee Keys wasnot as error-free as Ihad previously supposed. My benefactor was an Initiate of the Temple of Set whokindly provided me with acomplete microfilm of the original Dee diary Keys from the British Museum. Hencethe “Enochian” textreproduced with the Word of Set is an exact copy of the original as John Deepenned it, includingcapitalization.As I have noted above, this original does not lend itself to grammatically-basedtranslation or to word-for-word correlation with Dee’s own English “translation”. [The most recentefforts to do so - in DonaldLaycock’s Enochian Dictionary - resulted in an arbitrary subdividing of theEnochian text and the additionof a modern-English-based punctuation in order to “force” a correlation. Thequality of the result is self-evident.]An “Enochian purist” might question the translation provided by the Word of Setin that it is not theEnglish version recorded by John Dee in his diaries. My answer is simply that Iapproached the Keys not asa historian seeking to reprint what Dee did, but as a magician seeking tooperate the same “magicalmachinery” that Dee did - and to operate it with greater care and precision thanhe did.Hence it is not a case of my “corrupting Dee”, but rather of my uncorruptingsomething which predatedDee’s own existence, and which was, after all, not of his [or Kelley’s]authorship. Were one to take theposition that the Keys are a Dee/Kelley creation, then they would be fraudulentas a GBM Working - andmerely an uncommonly-successful LBM stunt which has mystified and obsessedoccultists these manycenturies.As it appears here, then, the Word of Set is an eighteenfold sequence ofstatements addressed to theoriginal (“third ordering”) Initiates of the Temple of Set in ancient times. The19th Part is not so much astatement as an operative invocation to be used for access to what Dee referredto as the “thirty aires oræthyrs”. Use of this invocation is best described in Crowley’s Liber LXXXIV velChanokh; see also TheVision and The Voice.52 Crowley (Ed. Regardie), Gems from the Equinox, pages #408-591.53 See the record of one such example in Chapter #1.54 Appendix #1.- 46 -What exactly is an “æthyr”? Cabalistically these are “rings” or “spheres” [ofconsciousness] progressivelycloser to the universal godhead. Per Crowley, each æthyr also awakens certainkinds of dispositions andperceptions in a magician who focuses his attention towards it - and may alsoprovide him with access torelated magical tools and/or weapons. The æthyrs will stand further exploration,in light of the Initiatoryadvances of the Æon of Set, and should provide a rich opportunity for Setians totest their GBM sensitivityand skills.I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe. I created HarWer that I mightdefine my Self.All other gods of all other times and nations have been created by men. This youknow fromthe first Part of my Word, and from my manifest semblance, which alone is not ofEarth.The Universe as a whole is mechanically consistent, but it does not possess a“God” personality thatfavors one of its components - such as mankind - above others. The Set-entity,however, is a finiteintelligence within the Universe and can draw such distinctions. Set is a beingoperating independently ofthe order of the objective universe, not in enforced or unconscious concert withit.“HarWer” or Har-ur (“Harœris” in Greek) was one of the most ancient forms of theEgyptian god Hor(“Horus” in Greek). [The English translation of Hor is “face”.]In predynastic and Old Kingdom times, Horus was the god of light, complementaryto Set as god ofdarkness. Together the two gods also symbolized the unity and wholeness of theEgyptian nation: Horus asthe god of the north (Lower Egypt) and Set as the god of the south (UpperEgypt). This union wasrepresented on monuments by the ritual gesture of samtaui, showing Horus and Setbinding the heraldicplants of Upper and Lower Egypt around the stem of an AnX, symbol of divinelife.The roles of Horus and Set as the original state gods of Egypt were furtheremphasized by the pharaohs’famous Double Crown ( SeXet), being a composite of the Red Crown of Horus (Teser) and the White Crownof Set ( Het/“Great One of Spells”). 55 And the Tcham sceptre, with the head andforked tail of Set, became asymbol of power and authority for gods and pharaohs alike.56Horus, originally a solar deity, was later adopted into the Osirian mythos asthe son of Osiris and Isis.Egyptologists generally distinguish the original and the corruption by the terms“Horus the Elder” and“Horus the Younger” respectively.HarWer is a form of Horus the Elder combined with Wer (“The Great God”), atranscendent god oflight. The Sun and the Moon were said to be the right and left eyes of HarWer,known as the Udjat (“Uræus”in Greek). At the same time the Udjat was also considered to partake of theessence of Set. “This is theUræus which came forth from Set.” 57 Mounted both on the SeXet and on othernational crowns andheadgear, the Udjat became another symbol of the pharaoh.According to the Book of Coming Forth by Night, the dual Set/HarWer entity isthe only “god” thatpossesses intelligence independent of the objective universe. The Universe as awhole is not intelligent, if arequirement of “intelligence” is an active, distinct personality; there isnothing for the Universe as a wholeto act upon or be distinct against. [This principle refutes the doctrine of“deism”, in which God is assumedto be identical with the totality of existence.]The only quality common to the entire objective universe as such is internalconsistency [which is not tosay that such consistency is a simple thing to incorporate]. And other gods,whether Egyptian or foreign, arederivative of Set or of the human mind. This does not imply that they are“imaginary” in the vulgar sense[except when crudely conceptualized by vulgar imaginations]. The disciplined,educated, and experiencedmind is capable of substantive creation; it can give life to stereotypical,archetypical, and/or unique godsand dæmons. This creative ability distinguishes the magician from thesuperstitious believer: The formerconceives and actualizes such entities consciously and deliberately, while thelatter is controlled andconditioned by externally-imposed images of them.The “Set-animal” of portraits and hieroglyphic inscriptions has remained theobject of considerablecontroversy. Its long, curved snout, stiffly-upraised and forked tail, and tall,brush-like ears (?) appear torule it out of any known animal category. The most extensive and thoroughtreatment of Set’s image to dateis by H. Te Velde in his classic work Seth, God of Confusion. 5855 Ions, op. cit. , page #62.56 Te Velde, op. cit. , pages #89-90.57 Utterance #683, The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, R.O. Faulkner (Trans.).London: Oxford University Press, 1969.58 The “-th” ending is the result of spellings of “Set” using the Greek letterq. In hieroglyphic writing, according to Budge, thename should be pronounced with a hard “-t” ( Egyptian Language, page #53).Similarly I write the name of Set’s divineconsort as Nepthys, not the q-heavy “Nephthys”. It is fair to point out,however, that the name of Set has appeared in phonetichieroglyphs in at least a dozen variations (Te Velde, op. cit. , pages #1-3).The Temple of Set uses the name with a hard “-t”,after the Book of Coming Forth by Night.- 47 -Among the animals he cites as past candidates for the Set-animal are the ass,oryx antelope, greyhound,fennec, jerboa, camel, okapi, long-snouted mouse, aardvark or orycteropus,giraffe, hog, boar, hare, jackal,tapir, long-snouted Nile mormyr, and the Egyptian Nh-bird. Dismissing each ofthe above as essentiallydifferent from the portraits and statues of Set, Te Velde takes the positionthat the question cannot beresolved from the information currently available to Egyptologists.Concerning the hieroglyphic image of Set, Te Velde states that it does not showthe characteristics of anactual, living animal, and expresses doubt whether the hieroglyph can be tracedto any animal which everexisted in the area of Egypt. 59In his magnum opus From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt, Sir E.A. Wallis Budgeattempts to associatethe Set-animal with the Saluki dog of Arabia. By way of evidence he cites thedog’s characteristicallyaggressive nature, ignoring the fact that it displays none of the aforementionedphysical features. HenceBudge’s identification must be rejected.60In hieroglyphic and pictorial representations, Set was also the only god shownwith red-toned skin.Most of the others were flesh-colored, save that Osiris and his principalattendants frequently had palegreen complexions (symbolic of corpse-flesh).One may note that Set was by no means the only “fabulous” creature everportrayed by Egyptian artists.But he was the only one represented as a principal god, as opposed to apurely-animalistic monster of theTuat.Known as the Hebrew Satan, I chose to bring forth a Magus, according to thefashion of myWord. He was charged to form a Church of Satan, that I might easily touch theminds of menin this image they had cast for me.Before proceeding further, I should perhaps at this point address a point ofconfusion concerning theSet/Satan relationship of particular note to some students of Aleister Crowley:Kenneth Grant, coeditor of many of Crowley’s works with John Symonds, hasrepeatedly andexhaustively tried to connect Set with Crowley’s philosophy in general, and withAiwass in particular. 61Crowley’s own writings, however, do not substantiate this. Crowley practicallyignored Set, except for anoccasional mention of the god in an Osirian-mythos context. In his principaldiscussion of the Devil on page#296 of Magick, for instance, he does not even include the name of Set.It is obvious that Crowley’s orientation with regard to Egyptian theology wasexclusively towards theOsiris-cult mythos. On page #399 of his Confessions, while discussing thesequence of magical æons interms of the Osirian triad (Isis, Osiris, and Horus the Younger), he emphasizesthe position of Horus as theavenger of his father Osiris - a role accorded only the Osirian corruption.Additional confirmations are to befound in Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law, wherein“Hoor-paar-Kraat” isidentified on page #94 as the “God of Silence” and “Harpocrates”, bothdesignations of Horus the Younger.On the following pages his position as the son of Osiris is restated. There areplenty of other examples, butthe point should be made.Grant also endeavors somewhat desperately to identify Set with “Shaitan”, whomhe states was the godworshipped by the Yezidi in Mesopotamia. The Yezidi religious texts - the BlackScripture and Book of theRevelation - do not use the term “Shaitan” at all, calling the Yezidi deity bythe name of Melek Taus, TausMelek, or Taus-e Malak. [Only in LaVey’s Satanic Rituals - which containsseveral errors in its Yezidisection - is the term “Shaitain” alleged to be a Yezidi term.] It is probablymerely a Hebrew spelling of“Satan”, and the Yezidi Book of the Revelation clearly establishes that theYezidis considered Jews to be“profane”. 62Summarily Kenneth Grant appears to arbitrarily rewrite ancient Egyptianmythology, Yezidi mythology,and the philosophy of Aleister Crowley according to his personal tastes.As noted previously, the Hebrew term “Satan” is a possible corruption of thehieroglyphic Set-hen. justas the Hebrew “YahWeh” and its derivative Christian trinity are corruptions ofthe earlier Osirian cult. 63By the end of the XXV Dynasty the Priesthood of Set in Egypt was probablydestroyed, 64 and thesubsequent loss of the hieroglyphic language virtually eliminated the originalSet from human knowledge.59 Te Velde, op. cit. , pages #13-15.60 Budge, From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt. London: Oxford University Press,1934, pages #87-89.61 Cf. page #226 in Grant’s Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God and page #x ofGrant’s introduction to The Magical Record ofthe Beast 666.62 See Chapter #22 and Appendices #69-70 in The Church of Satan.63 Brandon, S.G.F., Religion in Ancient History. New York: Charles Scribner’sSons, 1969, pages #102-132.64 Budge, The Mummy, page #276.- 48 -Only the Osirian corruption survived in legend - principally through Plutarch,who described it in somedetail in his Moralia. 65The archetypical dæmon most closely akin to Set was the Christian Satan,particularly in his Miltonianrepresentation. See in particular Book I of John Milton’s Paradise Lost. [Someinteresting comments arecontained in Asimov’s Annotated Paradise Lost by John Milton/Isaac Asimov(Garden City: Doubleday &Co., 1974). Asimov discusses both the role of Satan and the nature of evilitself at some length, and notalways to the credit of God.] Set accordingly chose this image as the one mostmeaningful for post-Egyptianmanifestations.The term “Magus” is used in the specialized sense of Western initiatorytradition. A Magus ischaracterized by his identification, comprehension, and introduction of a newmagical/philosophicalprinciple - a process described as the Utterance of a Word and/or Formula.For Aleister Crowley’s interpretation of the role of a Magus, see his Magick,page #330. [This is the“One Star in Sight” essay, which may also be found in other Crowley works and isabridged in Black Magicin the Crystal Tablet of Set.] Like a prophet he accomplishes this through amental “link” with a higherintellectual essence (what Plato termed Nœsis). Such a “link” may be eitherexternal (with a separateintelligence) or internal (with the higher sensitivity of one’s ownintelligence). In either case it is the resultsof the experience that are significant.Unlike a prophet, a Magus establishes such a “link” through deliberate mentalfocus, and with fullcomprehension of the result. Hence an essential distinction between magic and[conventional] religion isthat philosophical discipline is required for the former, while mentalrelaxation and abandonment of criticalfaculties (=faith) are required for the latter. 66In 1966 (the year I Anno Satani) Anton Szandor LaVey assumed the title of MagusV° and founded theChurch of Satan in San Francisco. For its first three years, the Church remainedprimarily a local institution.In 1969 it began to accept memberships from other areas. By 1971 it developed anationwide Priesthood andadministrative structure.In the fifth year of the Church of Satan, I gave to this Magus my Diabolicon,that he mightknow the truth of my ancient Gift to mankind, clothed though it might be in themyths of theHebrews. Even you, who delivered the Diabolicon from Asia, did not know it forwhat it was.But he that I had fashioned a Magus knew, and he thought often of the Diaboliconas heguided the Church of Satan.In January-March of the year 1970, I was a Satanist I° of the Church of Satan. Iwas also a FirstLieutenant in the Army, stationed in Lai Khe/Ben Cat, South Vietnam. Wishing tomake a contribution tothe lore of the Church, I decided to write a restatement of certain themes fromJohn Milton’s Paradise Lost.But what flowed from my pen began to assume a dignity beyond what I hadanticipated. Unlike the laterBook of Coming Forth by Night, it was not written in final draft in one sitting;rather the entire projectoccupied the better part of three months. I revised the Diabolicon extensivelyuntil I thought it “soundedright”, and then I recopied the final text in calligraphic letters becauseordinary handwriting or typed copyseemed inappropriate. The final document was sent to Anton LaVey in April of1970. His response camesoon thereafter:I received the Diabolicon safely. It is indeed a work which will have a lastingimpact. It is donein an ageless manner and with complete awareness. So impressed am I that I haveselected passagesfrom it for my own personal reading in this evening’s ceremony, which payshomage to the writingsof the Satanic Masters of the past, such as Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Twain,Hobbes, etc. … You havemy sincere gratitude for the fine gift you have so graciously bestowed upon us,and you may beassured that it will assume a meaningful place in the Order. 67The Diabolicon was retained unreleased in San Francisco. Although I subsequentlycirculated a fewtyped copies among the Priesthood, the Diabolicon was not made generallyavailable until the publication ofthe first edition of this Analysis & Commentary in 1976. It is included in TheChurch of Satan as Appendix#15.65 Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, Volume V in Moralia (14 volumes), F.C. Babbitt(Ed. & Trans.). London: Loeb Classical Library, 1936.66 Cf. William James, Varieties of Religious Experience.67 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 27, V/1970.- 49 -Upon the ninth Solstice, therefore, I destroyed my pact with Anton SzandorLaVey, and Iraised him to the Will of a Daimon, unbounded by the material dimensions. And soI thoughtto honor him beyond other men. But it may have been this act of mine thatordained his fall.For the next four years after the creation of the Diabolicon, I wrote nothingsimilar to it. Even adeliberate attempt to recapture its style - a manuscript entitled Flame ofInfernus - proved abortive. In thesummer of 1974, however, I once more experienced the restlessness that hadcharacterized the Working ofthe Diabolicon; and over a two-month period I penned a similar documentcontaining the message referredto in this passage. In August I again sent the calligraphic original to AntonLaVey. In an accompanying noteI disclaimed the prerogative to comment on it. The text of this document, sinceknown as the “Ninth SolsticeMessage”, is included in The Church of Satan as Appendix #111. Anton repliedwith a note in -uncharacteristically - his own handwriting:It pleases me that you perceive that which you do. You have entered a new realmofcomprehension and truly deserve the name of Satanist. 68What I did not know for many years was that coincidental with the forming of theChurch in 1966,Anton LaVey had privately handwritten and signed a personal Pact with Satan(titled simply “My Pact”). Henever mentioned nor displayed it to others, but on one evening in 1974, during avisit of mine to his home,we happened to be discussing Robert W. Chambers’ The King in Yellow. He left thePurple Room, thenreturned with a locked metal strongbox, which he opened, revealing his personalcopy of the then-quite-rarebook. The only other item in the strongbox was his Pact - which I was unable toread beyond seeing its titleand noting that it was completely handwritten on a single sheet of paper. I haveoften wondered whatmirrors of his innermost self it contained.Were I my Self to displace the Cosmic Inertia, I should be forced to become anew measure ofconsistency. I would cease to be One, for I should become All.Here Set observes that he, as a finite intelligence possessing the prerogativeto act in disregard of themechanical norm of the objective universe, cannot completely replace or redesignthat universe withouthimself becoming identical with it, i.e. infinite, omnipresent, hence mechanical[from the point of view ofany component intelligence]. This is a more precise restatement of the famousMiltonian paradox: that aconquered God would become Satan, and a conquering Satan God. [This theme isexplored by AnatoleFrance in his classic The Revolt of the Angels (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co.,1914).]To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to break his Self-reference to the boundsin whichhis semblance must exist.A human passing beyond the initiation of Magus encounters the same paradox thatSet describes above.He ceases to view himself as a finite intelligence working upon an inertialenvironment. Rather he attainssuch a strong sense of harmonious interrelationships that there is a tendency tosee the entire ObjectiveUniverse as conforming to his Word as a Magus.Initially this would seem to be immensely satisfying, but in fact the phenomenonis so instantaneous,automatic, and comprehensive that there is no particular sense of achievement.An individual in such asituation is in danger of losing a sense of unique identity, as the barriersbetween his consciousness and thephenomena of the universe become fluid. [It is not inappropriate to compare thisexperience to that ofquantum physicists, who suddenly encounter an objective universe in which all“constants” are revealed tobe “variables”.]A second consequence of this situation is that a human magician is stillrestricted to his physical body.This requires him to move about and to participate in the ordinary society ofnon-magicians. Skilledmagicians learn to do this without inciting fear in or ostracism bynon-magicians, but a Daimon may tend tocarelessness in such mundane matters. Accordingly he runs great danger ofbecoming a target of the mob.Socrates and Pythagoras were two who displayed Daimonic detachment. Both wereslain for their “impiety”.In the Church of Satan there was no initiatory degree beyond that of Magus V°(alternately called“Satanic Master”). The designation of “Daimon” here may be considered comparableto what the Temple ofSet would later Recognize as the VI° of Ipsissimus. The word “Daimon” comes fromthe Greek daimon,meaning “divine spirit” or “tutelary divinity”. It is, of course, the term whichwas later corrupted into theChristian term “demon”. The irony is not inappropriate.68 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, August 22, IX/1974.[index-50_1.png]- 50 -I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore to AntonSzandor LaVey hishuman aspect and his degree of Magus in my Order. Thus all may understand thathe isdearly held by me, and that the end of the Church of Satan is not a thing ofshame to him. Buta new Aeon is now to begin, and the work of Anton Szandor LaVey is done. Let himbe atease, for no other man has ever seen with his eyes.In May 1975, Anton LaVey announced his intention to sell the initiatory degreesof the Church of Satanfor “professional services, funds, real estate, objects of value, etc.”. It wasa decision completely inconsistentwith the previous standards of individual awareness and ability he hadmaintained, nor would it haveachieved its intended result of augmenting his income. It was precisely thenon-corruptible nature of theSatanic degrees which had made them so highly prized. Such a startling shortfallof logic by an individualknown for his analytical mind was inexplicable. The entire Church of Satan wasplunged into crisis;organizational resignations poured in; and by the end of June the once-strongnational network hadvirtually ceased to exist.For a decade the Church of Satan had surmounted every obstacle and solved everyproblem with an easeunequaled and unprecedented in occultism. Now it was dying, not with a bang butwith a whimper, This toowe could not understand. Hence my decision to appeal directly to Satan on theeve of the North Solstice.In the Book of Coming Forth by Night Set assumes responsibility for thedisastrous course of events byciting the unanticipated dangers of the Daimonic state of mind. At the same timehe implies that the Age ofSatan (Set/HarWer) would have evolved into the Æon of Set in any case [thoughthis would not necessarilyhave meant an organizational crisis or change in leadership; it was the means,not the end, which proved tobe unnecessarily traumatic].In middle Egyptian hieroglyphic this inscription reads: Xu thenru ast a ari-f emsuten. Translation: “Hedid many glorious things and mighty deeds as High Priest.”.In April of the common year 1904, I came forth in Africa as my Opposite Self andbroughtinto being an Aeon to end the horrors of the stasis of the death-gods of men.This new Aeonwas a Purification, to prepare men for that which would follow it.On April 8-10, 1904 in Cairo, Aleister Crowley wrote down the Book of the Law, amagical text whichannounced the end of the Æon of Osiris and the beginning of the Æon of Horus.Crowley was identified asthe Magus of that Æon [though he did not immediately acknowledge the title], andits Word was proclaimedto be Thelema (Greek thelhma = Will).Crowley’s most thorough account of this incident is to be found in his book TheEquinox of the Gods,published by the O.T.O. in 1936. See also “The Temple of Solomon the King” inhis Equinox #I-7. For anoutside analysis, see pages #61-66 (“Aiwass, the Holy Guardian Angel”) in JohnSymonds’ The Great Beast(London: Macdonald & Co. Ltd., 1971).Crowley attributed the Book of the Law to Aiwass, an entity identified in thetext as “the minister ofHoor-paar-kraat”.69 In translation this becomes “the infant Horus” and refers to[the Greek] Harpokrates, arepresentation of Horus the Younger as an infant.Crowley was not familiar with the distinctions between the original Horus andthe later Osiriancorruption. His Egyptological orientation appears to have been exclusivelyOsirian, since his commentsconcerning various Egyptian gods place them squarely in the Osiris-cultcharacterizations. He named themagical æons according to the Osirian triad - first that of Isis, then that ofOsiris, and finally that of “thecrowned and conquering child”, Horus the Younger. 70Closely associated with - and mentioned in - the Book of the Law was an Egyptianfunerary stele, whichCrowley called the “Stele of Revealing”. The three figures on this stele, whomCrowley called Nuit, Hadit,and Ra Hoor Khuit, lent their names to the three chapters of the Book of theLaw.Nuit he correctly identified as the Egyptian sky goddess.Hadit or Had is not the name of any Egyptian deity; the winged solar disk inquestion is identified in thehieroglyphs of the stele as Behut-t (Horus Behdety), a form of Horus the Elderworshipped in the western69 The Book of the Law #I-7.70 See pages #22, #399, and #665 in Crowley’s Confessions. Concerning Horus theYounger/Harpocrates, see Ions, op. cit. , pages#68 and #72.- 51 -Nile Delta at Behdet. 71 [The curious term “Hadit” is actually Arabic, and means“a divinely inspiredutterance”.]As for Ra Hoor Khuit, whom Crowley incorrectly identifies as Horus the Younger,72 the hieroglyphs onthe stele title the figure Ra-Harakhti. Ra-Harakhti (“Ra-Horus of the TwoHorizons”) was a form of Horusthe Elder identified with Ra, especially in his aspects of Atum and Xepera. 73Ra-Harakhti was a rival “final judgment” god to Osiris in addition to being asolar deity, which explainshis presence on the funerary stele. He is also noteworthy for having defendedSet in the Osirian-mythos trialbetween Set and Horus the Younger. [At one point in the debate, according to thelegend, Ra-Harakhti wasinsulted and retired to his house in a huff. The proceedings resumed only afterHathor had cheered thegrouchy god with a striptease. 74 ]The Book of the Law and the “Stele of Revealing”, consequently, are notdocuments of the Osiris/Isis/Horus the Younger triad or cult. They reflect the more ancient solar/light cultsof Ra and Horus the Elder -the “Opposite Self” of Set.And Aleister Crowley received the Book of the Law, and my Opposite Self declaredhimMagus of the Aeon.Crowley did not acknowledge the title of Magus (9)=[2] (according to theA.'.A.'. system) until 1915-16,although the Book of the Law appears to confirm him thus in 1904. 75 Mycommentary on the Book of theLaw appears as Appendix #5.But HarWer, my Opposite Self, is a strange and fitful presence. I, Set, am mySelf distinctfrom the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordered in and of my Self. HarWer I waswhen I wasonce part of the Cosmos and could achieve identity only by becoming what theCosmic orderwas not. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a Void in which truecreation couldtake form as Set.Here is recounted the phenomenon of the separation of the Set-entity from theUniversal order. It isinteresting to compare this statement with the “revolt” of Lucifer and hissubsequent metamorphosis intoSatan. [See in particular Book I of Milton’s Paradise Lost and the Statement ofSatan ArchDaimon in theDiabolicon.]But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the Cosmic inertia without having toassume its place.And so HarWer must exist while Set exists.Ostensibly this is a restatement of the previously-discussed “Satanic paradox”.Contained here,however, is the comment that the preservation of the HarWer entity is necessaryfor the continued existenceand independence of the Set-entity. HarWer thus acts as a sort of “buffer”between Set and the Universallaw that seeks to include all existential phenomena within itself.It might also be hypothesized that the HarWer entity is a sort of link betweenSet and the objectiveuniverse which enables him to act upon it, although he does not directlyparticipate in it.This passage may also be considered from the standpoint of physics. If Set is abeing that displacesspace, then he must consist of matter. Matter may be formed by the applicationof energy within a zero-mass environment, the result being equal quantities of matter and antimatter. 76While both the matter unitand the antimatter unit may theoretically be transformed into energy [the E=mc2equation], neither can bedestroyed unless they are brought together. Should such a reunion occur, theresult would be an explosionreleasing many hundreds of times as much energy as a hydrogen fusion bomb of thesame size. The matter71 Ions, op. cit. , pages #67-68.72 Crowley, Aleister, Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of theLaw.

Klein, former Professor ofTheoretical Physics at the University of Stockholm.]- 52 -and antimatter would return to zero mass, and the energy required for theinitial separation would berecreated.77If Set is not matter or antimatter, he may be an energy-form of either. This isnecessarily purespeculation, because detection of material energy - let alone distinguishing itfrom antimaterial energy - at agreat distance is a young science. Such a hypothesis, however, would explain theexistence of Set in a formundetected by the human sense-range within the electromagnetic spectrum.The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equinox of the common year 1966, whenHarWerand Set were fused in one composite being. And so commenced the time ofSet-HarWer -known as the Age of Satan - which was to bridge the expiring Aeon of HarWer andtheforthcoming Aeon of Set.Anton LaVey announced the founding of the Church of Satan on Walpurgisnacht(April 30) 1966, ashort time after the Vernal Equinox (approximately March 21). Simultaneously heannounced the beginningof what he termed the Age of Satan.In his Satanic Rituals he defines this concept in terms of Hans Hörbiger’sWelteislehre or Doctrine ofEternal Ice, in which the history of the Universe consists of alternating cyclesof fire and ice. 78 The “Wel”, asit was termed, gained popularity in Nazi Germany because of Adolf Hitler’senthusiasm for Hörbiger, whomhe called the “German Copernicus”.Anton LaVey, however, offers the theory in a social, not a cosmological context.The key number, hesuggests, is nine - the number of the Devil because it always returns to itselfwhen subjected to basicmathematical calculations. [For example: 9x3=27 and 2+7=9. 92=81 and 8+1=9.]History, says Anton, is divided into “Epochs” of 13,122 [adds to 9] years. EachEpoch is divided intonine “Ages” [1,458 years: adds to 18 and 1+8=9], and each Age consists of nine“Eras” [162 years: adds againto 9]. An Era is divided into nine 18-year “Workings”. A Working consists ofnine years of “action” followedby nine years of “reaction”, with the midpoint year being a “zenith ofintensity” and the beginning andending years being “Working Years”. The initial Working Year sees the generationof the Working, while thefinal one is witness to its ultimate product. 79Whether or not there is any external basis for this theory of social evolution,the history of the Church ofSatan itself adhered to it. At the midpoint of the mid-year of the Working begunin mid-1966, the Churchwent through the crisis which resulted in its transformation into the Temple ofSet. Strictly speaking, theTemple is not so much a “reaction” to the doctrines or design of the Church asit is an “evolutionarysuccession” to them.And what of the final Working Year (1983)? At the Wewelsburg Castle inWestphalia, Germany inOctober of 1982 was celebrated the Wewelsburg Working, resulting in thereconstitution of the Order of theTrapezoid, a creature of both the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set.The “fusing of HarWer and Set as one composite being” evidently does not referto a physical reunion ofthe two entities, else there would have been some spectacular fireworks andneither Set nor HarWer wouldhave survived. Some sort of mental link or unified purpose seems to be implied.The use of the Age of Satanas a “bridge” between the two Æons seems appropriate. During the Æon of Horusthere was a revival ofvarious forms of primeval life-worship, as well as a reaction against thedeath-worship monotheist cults.During the Age of Satan this “purge” reached a climax, with all external godsbeing denied and man as “justanother animal” being deified. 80 Only in an atmosphere free from subconsciousmental programming couldthe Temple of Set be reestablished in an authentic form, uncorrupted by theOsirian distortions.Again Set pointedly uses the phrase “common year” when referring to theChristian (“Anno Domini”)dating system; his repugnance is evident.77 Ibid. , page #29.78 Pauwels, Louis and Bergier, Jacques, The Morning of the Magicians.

And so the Book of theLaw wasconfusion to all who came upon it, and the creative brilliance of the MagusAleister Crowleywas ever flawed by mindless destructiveness. He himself could never understandthis, for heperceived HarWer as a unified Self. And so he was perplexed by a mystery hecould notidentify.HarWer, as an entity possessing characteristics of both the non-consciousuniverse and theindependently-conscious Set, is necessarily inconsistent and irrational from theperspective of either Set orthe objective universe. HarWer is not a true synthesis in the Hegelian sense.Rather he is the antithesis thatenables Set to emerge - not as a synthesis, but as an entirely distinct andseparate being. [This is arestatement and refinement of the sequence cited in the Diabolicon.]The Book of the Law is extremely emotional, internally inconsistent, rambling,and in general quiteconfusing to those who have read it. Nonetheless it conveys an atmosphere ofauthenticity [or at least theglamor of mystery].Why would a god make such mistakes and present such a profile? The compositionof HarWer explainsthis. The Great Horus is not a foolish or childish neter, but rather one who iscaught between the Scylla ofSet and the Charibdis of the objective universe: perpetually attracted to andrejecting of both.Crowley’s disciples have debated the Book of the Law vigorously for the years ofits existence, and notwo of them have been able to reach a consensus upon it. Crowley himselfremained at odds with the text,speculating upon it for the rest of his life.As for his “creative brilliance” and “mindless destructiveness”, no one familiarwith the writings andcareer of Aleister Crowley will deny either quality. Indeed he acknowledged bothof them in his own diariesand publications, yet without resolving to address [or even to fault] hisnegative qualities. Had he succeededin overcoming them, he could well have been a respected, rather than an infamousfigure in his own time.Ironically it is Crowley’s notoriety that has accounted for much of hisposthumous popularity. [Thenthere is the question whether a “reformed” Aleister Crowley would have remained“the” Aleister Crowley.Perhaps not. His split personality was essential to his function as Magus of theÆon of Horus, per theconstitution of Horus himself.]Crowley’s “perception of HarWer as a unified Self” presumably refers to hisignorance of the distinctionbetween the original Horus and the later Osirian corruption. The Osirian Horuswas a unified personality(Osiris’ son) who fought Set (recast as Osiris’ evil brother). 81 Horus theElder was complementary to Set, notantagonistic towards him, and so these two original gods were often shown with asingle body. 82The god identified by Crowley as Horus the Younger was in fact Horus the Elder.This accounts for the“surprising” inconsistency of Crowley’s patron, as well as Crowley’soft-expressed bewilderment at suchbehavior.Inclusion here of the word “perplexed” is significant in a particularly poignantsense. According to TheGreat Beast, the definitive biography of Crowley by John Symonds, the agingMagus spent his last years innear-poverty, sick from heroin addiction and visited only infrequently byfriends. He fought death, tears inhis eyes as he sank into his final coma; and his last words were “I am perplexed…” 8381 Ions, op. cit. , pages #72-78. The Osirian legends on this subject aretreated comprehensively in J. Gwyn Griffith’s The Conflictof Horus and Seth (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers, 1969).82 Te Velde, op. cit. , pages #68-72.83 Symonds, The Great Beast, page #400.[index-54_1.png][index-54_2.png][index-54_3.png]- 54 -And I, Set, spoke too in the Book of the Law - “Aye! listen to the numbers andthe words -“What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not, nor shalt thou know ever. Therecomethone to follow thee: he shall expound it.”These are verses #75 and #76 from the second chapter of the Book of the Law. Thestrange handwritingis that of Aleister Crowley, from his original manuscript of the document. Verse#47 of the third chapterstates:This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original inthe writing of theBeast; for in the chance shape of the letters and in their position to oneanother: in these aremysteries no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh afterhim, whence I say not,who shall discover the Key of it all. 84Significantly, all printed texts of the Book of the Law show “24” and “89”without the top and bottomlines that suggest their sum as integers. Only the Crowley handwriting indicatesthis. Verse #47 continues:Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a keyalso.Again the figures are shown only on the handwritten manuscript. The line inquestion progressesthrough squares of a grid. The “failing circle” is located in one of thesquares. If “each number becomes thecorresponding letter”, then the sum of the multiplied coordinates of the line[3+6+9+16+20+30+35=119]less the multiplied coordinate of the “failing circle” [28] = 91 = 10 or X, theyear in which the Æon of Set wasmanifest and the Temple of Set revived.Crowley, in defiance of #III-47, believed the “one” to be Charles StansfeldJones of Vancouver. AfterJones’ disavowal of the Æon of Horus and its Beast, however, Crowley reversedhis earlier opinion andexpelled Jones from the A.'.A. '.85In his “New Comment” to the Book of the Law ca. 1920 CE, Crowley describesverses #II-75 & #II-76 asbeing a “Qabalistic test”, identifying the person who may claim to be theBeast’s Magical Heir. Moreover thesolution will be conspicuous for the simplicity of its method, and its messagewill carry self-evidentconviction.Crowley’s use of the term “Qabala” differs in key respects from conventionalinterpretations of the“Hebrew” Cabala. For example:Qabala is an instrument for interpreting symbols whose meaning has becomeobscure,forgotten, or misunderstood by establishing a necessary connection between theessence of forms,sounds, simple ideas (such as number) and their spiritual, moral, orintellectual equivalents. Youmight as well object to interpreting ancient art by consideration of beauty asdetermined byphysiological facts. 86The “New Comment” continues with a word of doubt expressed concerning Jones’announcedattainment of the grade of Magister Templi (8)=[3], inasmuch as Jones had notadvanced sequentiallythrough all of the lesser grades. Should it become evident that Jones hadwrongfully assumed the (8)=[3],said Crowley, he would be destroyed as a “Black Brother”. Crowley defines thisterm thus:To attain the Grade of Magister Templi, he [the Adeptus Exemptus] must performtwo tasks:the emancipation from thought by putting each idea against its opposite andrefusing to prefer84 The Book of the Law #III-47.85 Symonds, op. cit. , pages #226 and #351-352.86 Crowley, 777. New York: Samuel Weiser, 1970, page #125.- 55 -either, and the consecration of himself as a pure vehicle for the influence ofthe order to which heaspires. He must then decide upon the critical adventure of our Order: theabsolute abandonmentof himself and his attainments …Should he fail, by will or weakness, to make his self-annihilation absolute, heis nonethelessthrust forward into the Abyss; but instead of being received and reconstructedin the Third Order[the Silver Star of the A.'.A.'.] as a Babe in the womb of our Lady Babalon,under the Night of Pan,to grow up to be Himself wholly and truly as He was not previously, he remainsin the Abyss,secreting his elements around his Ego as if isolated from the Universe, andbecomes what is called a“Black Brother”.Such a being is gradually disintegrated from lack of nourishment and the slowbut certainaction of the attraction of the rest of the Universe, despite his now desperateefforts to insulate andprotect himself, and to aggrandize himself by predatory practices. He may indeedprosper forawhile, but in the end he must perish, especially when with a new Æon a new Wordis proclaimedwhich he cannot and will not hear, so that he is handicapped by trying to use anobsolete method ofMagick, like a man with a boomerang in a battle where everyone else has a rifle.87Here there is a paradox. To become a Magister Templi, an individual is told todestroy his capacity forlogical thought, i.e. his ability to draw deductive or inductive conclusionsfrom the phenomena of theobjective universe. Since it is precisely this capacity that produces the“mirror in which the Self may beseen” ( Cogito Ergo Sum), the aspirant is invited to obliterate just what it isthat enables him to perceivehimself as a unique entity. Theoretically he is “reconstructed by the gods in aperfect form” - an ideal “self”.Herein lies the heart of the paradox: It is that an independent Will, capable ofperceiving itself incontrast to the objective universe, cannot be entirely a product of forcesderivative of that universe. Truefreedom of the Will necessitates the ability of that Will to move both with andagainst objective-universalpatterns (“laws”). The Will is Self-creating, Self-sustaining, andSelf-improving. [This is the basis for theFormula of the Æon of Set XXX.]Because of the paradox, it is impossible for a Magister Templi to be the resultof such an annihilation asCrowley prescribes. Such a “Magister” would possess no Will of its own; it wouldbe a zombie, non-consciously moving in harmony with the objective-universal laws. It would be ananimated corpse, a mere“meat machine”. This would not be a rebirth of the Self; it would be suicideunder the illusion ofparticipating in a “greater life force”.Now let us look a little more closely at Crowley’s description of a “BlackBrother”. Those familiar withCrowley’s life will note that, in these few short phrases, a veritable blueprintfor his own life has beenpresented. Crowley’s writings attest to the overwhelming presence of hisindividual Will in all of hisenterprises.The inevitable conclusion is that there is no Right-Hand Path to the initiatorylevel of Magister Templi[at least not as prescribed by the original G.'.D.'. and A.'.A.'.]. There isonly the Left-Hand Path, and it isfraught with danger - not a one-time crossing-the-Abyss test, but a continuousperil that exists from themoment the individual completely realizes him-Self as a Magister.The Magister Templi is one who can comprehend the entire objective universe. Inorder to do this, hecannot have vision which is distorted by instinctive assumptions internal tothat universe. He - his Will -must be independent, separate, and distinct. This necessitates an extremelystrong presence of mind, apersonality that is sufficiently secure not to require “crutches” from theobjective universe, and adetermination to fight off the panic that could result from the sensation ofbeing utterly alone.The Magister Templi, if he is truly entitled to that degree, possesses theabilities necessary to thwartthese dangers. Those who presume to that degree without appreciating thesedangers or the severe mentalpressures they can cause, do in fact suffer the fate that Crowley prescribes:death or loss of sanity [or mererelapse from that level of initiation to a less-stressful one, or even toprofane “freedom from initiation” … Cf.Fromm, Escape from Freedom].And many of the Aeon of HarWer sought to read this but could not. Nor could theMagushimself, though he guessed rightly at its simplicity. It was said that everynumber is infinite -hence each number or sum of joined numbers became merely the correspondingletter.The statement that every number is infinite is also in the Book of the Law[#I-4].Crowley develops this concept in a brilliant essay appended to 777 which he alsoincluded in his latercommentaries on the Book of the Law. Its central thesis may be found in thefollowing included statements:By adding 1 to 8 we obtain 9, so that we might define unity as that which hasthe property oftransforming a three-dimensional expansion of two into a two-dimensionalexpansion of three. Butif we add unity to 9, unity appears as that which has the power of transformingthe two-dimensional87 Crowley, Aleister, Magick, page #332.- 56 -expansion of three aforesaid into a mere oblong measuring 5 by 2. Unity thusappears as inpossession of two totally different properties. Are we then to conclude that itis not the same unity?How are we to describe unity, how know it? Only by experiment can we discoverthe nature of itsaction on any given number. In certain minor respects, this action exhibitsregularity. We know, forexample, that it uniformly transforms an odd number into an even one, and viceversa; but that ispractically the limit of what we can predict as to its action.We can go further, and state that any number soever possesses this infinitevariety of powers totransform any other number, even by the primitive process of addition. Weobserve also how themanipulation of any two numbers can be arranged so that the result isincommensurable witheither, or even so that ideas are created of a character totally incompatiblewith our originalconception of numbers as a series of positive integers. We obtain unreal andirrational expressions,ideas of a wholly different order, by a very simple juxtaposition of suchapparently comprehensibleand commonplace entities as integers.There is only one conclusion to be drawn from these various considerations. Itis that the natureof every number is a thing peculiar to itself, a thing inscrutable and infinite,a thing inexpressible,even if we could understand it. 88The corresponding letters are those of the English alphabet, in keeping with theEnglish text of the Bookof the Law. Cabalists may desire an interpretation based upon the Hebrewalphabet or Cabala. In the Bookof Coming Forth by Night, however, Set implicitly rejects the entire Hebraicmythos as a latter-daycorruption of the Osiris cult. The Cabala, whose authenticity is alreadyquestioned by reputable scholars ofJewish religion, is nowhere to be found in the Book of Coming Forth by Night,or, for that matter, in theTemple of Set. 89Even so the sequence remained unknown - and so, after its issue, to me as well.For, while Imay pass free of the boundaries of time, memory of the future cannot exist.Set states that he may “pass free of the boundaries of time” - a rather curiousway of addressing theproblem of time-travel. Yet such “passing free” seems to involve mentalperception of the past and presentonly, not the future. This has interesting implications for those who believe in“predestination” (a fixedcourse of future events). The contrasting school is that of free will, whichcannot exist unless the future isundetermined. The problem, as Crowley and Gurdjieff demonstrated, is one ofidentifying the true will andfreeing it from mechanical conditioning, either conscious or subconscious. 90Time-travel - or, more precisely, the control of time - is a skill which isessential to a magician. IsaacNewton believed in the idea of a universal “absolute time” or “linear duration”,saying that time is a thing initself, not a relation between events. Leibniz argued to the contrary,foreshadowing Einstein, who said in his1905 paper:If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of itscoordinates asfunctions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind that a description ofthis kind has nophysical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time”.We have to takeinto account that all judgments in which time plays a part are always judgmentsof simultaneousevents. If for instance I say “that train arrives here at seven o’clock”, I meansomething like this:“The pointing of the small hand of my watch to seven and the arrival of thetrain are simultaneousevents.”It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending to thedefinition of “time” bysubstituting “the position of the small hand of my watch” for “time”. And infact such a definition issatisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively for theplace where the watch islocated; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time seriesof events occurring atdifferent places, or - what comes to the same thing - to evaluate the times ofevents occurring atplaces remote from the watch. 9188 Crowley, Aleister, 777, pages #134-135.89 According to Richard Cavendish, writing in the Encyclopædia of theUnexplained (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974), the“Hebrew Cabala’s” oldest identifiable works can be authenticated to between thethird and sixth centuries CE. Since that time ithas been added to and revised by innumerable occultists, with the result that ithas lost even what cohesion it may once have had.90 The most lucid explanation of the Gurdjieff approach to this subject iscontained in P.D. Ouspensky’s The Psychology of Man’sPossible Evolution (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969). Crowley did not addressthe notion of free will in depth, save perhapsindirectly in Liber Aleph. He seems to have interpreted the idea in a mysticalsense, along the lines of The Sacred Magic ofAbra=Melin the Mage (S.L.M. Mathers [Trans.], Chicago: deLawrence, 1948). Seepages #172-179 in Crowley’s Confessions.91 Whitrow, G.J., The Nature of Time. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston,1972.[index-57_1.jpg]- 57 -Then there was an effort to prove “linear duration” by the Second Law ofThermodynamics - thetendency of ordered molecular structure to decompose (the phenomenon ofentropy). Logically it isunsound, if it is assumed that the laws of motion are symmetrical for bothdirections of time. [Symmetry for“reverse time” can be demonstrated by the actions of particles at the subatomiclevel.] So “time” is not afixed law which the magician cannot influence; he may at the very leastaccelerate or decelerate it. To “passfree” of it altogether, he would have to be a being like Set, i.e. independentof the laws governing theobjective universe.Now it has come to pass, and the Book of the Law is laid bare - “Destined FirstCentury heir -Aquino - breaking Keys by doctrines Anton LaVey - great Magus of reconsecrationcomingYear Xeper - founding his rightful Priesthood - Set - true origin Volume AL.”MichaelAquino, you are become Magus V° of the Aeon of Set.I, Set, am come again to my friends among mankind - Let my great nobles bebrought to me.Set has returned in his true identity, for the first time since the destructionof the original Temple of Setin ancient Egypt. “Let my great nobles be brought to me” is the same passagethat, in hieroglyphs,surrounds the Seal of Set at the end of the Book of Coming Forth by Night.In Khem I remain no longer, for I am forgotten there, and my house at PaMat-etis dust.

Other cities which were centers of the Setian Priesthood wereOmbos at 24.5N, 32.9E andTanis at 31N, 31.9E in Lower Egypt. 92Magus of my Aeon - Manifest the Will of Set.The essential characteristic of a Magus is the manifestation of a philosophicalprinciple - in magicalterminology the “utterance of a Word” - to supersede or enhance previous ways ofunderstanding,actualizing, improving, and eventually transcending the human condition.Reconsecrate my Temple and my Order in the true name of Set. No longer will Iaccept thebastard title of a Hebrew fiend.When I resigned from the Church of Satan on June 10, 1975, I spoke for itsMandate and, as a MagisterTempli IV°, assumed the Satanic High Priesthood. Initial steps were takentowards a “second Church ofSatan” during the next ten days. With the coming into being of the Book ofComing Forth by Night, thoseplans were dropped. The Temple of Set was organized, incorporated, andrecognized nationally as a tax-exempt religious institution within four months.The “bastard title” is “Satan”, which is in Hebrew a title (“Adversary”)although in Egyptian it is thename Set-hen (“Majesty of Set”). It is by Set’s name that he is known within hisTemple and Priesthood,with “Satan” being used only to identify him by his historic image to theprofane.92 Brugsch-Bey, Heinrich, Egypt Under the Pharaohs. New York: Charles Scribner’sSons, 1891, page #452.Ions, op. cit. , page #63.Carus, op. cit. , page #17.- 58 -When I first came to this world, I gave to you my great pentagram, timelessmeasure ofbeauty through proportion. And it was shown inverse, that creation and change beexaltedabove rest and preservation.The significance of the pentagram is discussed in Chapter #16.With the years my pentagram was corrupted, yet time has not the power to destroyit. Itsposition was restored by the Church of Satan, but its essence was dimmed with aMoorishname, and the perverse letters of the Hebrews, and the goat of decadent Khar.During theAge of Satan I allowed this curious corruption, for it was meant to do me honoras I was thenperceived.As its emblem the Church of Satan used the Sigil of Baphomet, an inversepentagram decorated with agoat’s head and surrounded by the Hebrew letters lamed/vav/yod/tav/nun = LVYTN =Leviathan, the seamonster mentioned in Job #41 of the Judaic/Christian Bible. The goat was theGoat of Mendes, the Devil’sform of manifestation in traditional Satanism. 93The term “Baphomet” - the “Moorish name” - came into prominence as the godreputedly worshippedby the medieval Knights Temple (Order of the Temple). There have been manycolorful and creativeexplanations of this curious term, but the most sensible is that of Idries Shah,who in his book The Sufissuggests that it is a corruption of the Arabic abufihamat (pronounced“bufihimat”), which means “father” or“source of understanding”.Going beyond Shah, this in turn may have been a corruption from the ancientEgyptian Ba-neb-Tettu,the hieroglyphic term for the city of Mendes, capital of the XVI Khar Nome inthe Nile Delta at 31N, 31.5E,not far distant from Tanis. In Ptolemaic accounts Mendes was “notorious” for itsgoat-god, who was said tomate with human females in religious festivals. The truth is probably lesslurid. Comments Budge in hisGods of the Egyptians:The title Ba-neb-Tettu was sometimes held to mean the “Soul, the Lord Tettu”,and this was thename at Mendes of the local form of Khnemu, whose symbol there, as elsewhere,was a ram … Hewas regarded as the virile principle in gods and men, and is styled “King of theSouth and North, theram, the virile male, the holy phallus which stirreth up the passions of love …”But this is now my Aeon, and my pentagram is again to be pure in its splendor.Cast aside thecorruptions, that the pentagram of Set may shine forth. Let all who seek me benever withoutit, openly and with pride, for by it I shall know them.The pentagram as used by the Temple of Set is returned to its pure form, so thatthe beauty of Φ isundiluted and undefiled. It is enclosed in a perfect circle (a function of π),which represents themathematical order of the Universe. The pentagram does not touch the circle,however, signifying that Set isan independent entity.The pentagram itself does not appear on statues and bas-reliefs of Set that havecome to light, nor doesthe Temple of Set use the image of Set against the pentagram in place of theBaphometic goat. Each may beconsidered a “key” to knowledge of the other, rather than two parts of a whole.The reconsecrated Temple of Set displays the pentagram openly, and Initiates ofall degrees wear asimple pentagram medallion as evidence of their affiliation.Let the one who aspires to my knowledge be called by the name Setian.The word “Setian” is now used to refer generally to all Initiates of the Templeof Set. It is used in a morespecific sense as the formal title of the First Degree of Initiation, whoserecipients are in the position ofaspirants to the knowledge of the Temple.I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilationwhichnone but the Elect may hope to avoid. And alone I cannot preserve my Elect, butI wouldteach them and strengthen their Will against the coming peril, that they andtheir blood mayendure. To do this I must give further of my own Essence to my Elect, and,should they fail,the Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended.The term “Elect” refers to the degrees II° and higher in the Temple of Set. Inaddition to avowingthemselves Setians, such Initiates have been examined by the Priesthood andfound Adept in the arts andsciences encompassed by the Temple. The Temple of Set does not judge or evaluateInitiates by criteria93 LaVey, The Satanic Bible, pages #129 and #136.- 59 -outside of its specialized areas of expertise. Hence it is more an intellectualdiscipline or school of thoughtthan a community per se.During the first several years of the Æon, I was inclined to interpret thewarning of this passage interms of the general ecological crisis confronting the human race as a wholeduring the next century. Whilethe factors presaging that crisis remain, it is increasingly obvious that theTemple of Set is far too selectivein scope and interests to be a significant factor in confronting it.It seems more probable that Set’s warning is meant to alert the Elect to thegeneral fear which profanehumans feel concerning Initiates of the Black Art, and in particular theirtendency to search out scapegoatsduring times of stress, confusion, and crisis. [See also the Eighth, Ninth, andTenth Parts of the Word of Set- a warning to the original Temple of Set which proved all too justified.]The Temple of Set’s response to this situation is first to dispel fear born ofignorance by explaining itsexoteric doctrines to the honestly curious, and secondly to avoid the carelessoversimplification of itsesoteric doctrines in contexts which would tend to excite the superstitiousdread of the profane.Concerning the “gift of Set’s own Essence to the Elect”, see also theDiabolicon, specifically theStatement of Azazel.Note again the phrase “Majesty of Set”.Behold, it is I who call you, because you are the Guardians of the Aeon of Set,zealous in whatyou do.This is a salutation to the Council of Nine, the highest officials of the Templeof Set and Guardians of theÆon. Their emblem is the sacred Tcham sceptre. They carry forward the traditionand name of the NineUnknown, the basis of the Church of Satan’s Council of Nine and now of theTemple’s Council.The Legend of the Nine Unknown, as recounted by Louis Pauwels and JacquesBergier in their Morningof the Magicians, began with Asoka, Emperor of the Maurya Kingdom of India fromapproximately 274 to236 BCE. He became a Buddhist ca. 260 BCE, and was famous for administering hiskingdom according tothe most enlightened principles. Before his death he selected nine great sagesto form a secret, protectivesociety to carry on his life’s work. Each One of the Nine would select ninedeputies known to him alone, andeach of these nine would select an additional nine, etc. [The legend waspopularized in Talbot Mundy’s 1925novel The Nine Unknown.]94The High Priest of Set determines the policies and operations of the Temple andPriesthood of Set, buthe in turn is responsible to the Nine.The Satanist thought to approach Satan through ritual. Now let the Setian shunallrecitation, for the text of another is an affront to the Self. Speak rather tome as a friend,gently and without fear, and I shall hear as a friend. Do not bend your knee nordrop youreye, for such things were not done in my house at PaMat-et. But speak to me atnight, for thesky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier. And those who call me the PrinceofDarkness do me no dishonor.Set was originally the god of the hours of darkness; hence, presumably, thesuitability of the title “Princeof Darkness”. The word “prince” derives from the Latin Princeps, meaning“first”. Etymologically this is notinappropriate.From a physical standpoint there are a surprising number of differences betweenthe hours of daylightand the hours of darkness. This cycle is, of course, controlled by the positionof the Sun relative to the Earth.There are resultant changes in gravitational pull, weather, the Earth’s magneticfield, radiation levels, andboth plant and animal physiology. The impact of this cycle on the brain is asyet undetermined. 95It may be noted that the sky, seemingly opaque by day, becomes transparent atnight. Alpha Draconis isthen visible.The Setian need conjure neither curse nor kindness from me, for by the magic ofmy greatpentagram I shall see with his eyes. And then the strength that is mine shall bethe strengthof the Setian, and against the Will of Set no creature of the Universe maystand. And I thinknot of those who think not of me.The pentagram is here described as a geometric “gate” linking the mind of theBlack Magician with thatof Set [in a GBM Working]. The Temple of Set is also admonished to direct itsefforts towards its ownInitiates, not towards mankind as a whole. A crucial distinction is thus drawnbetween humans who seek to94 Pauwels and Bergier, op. cit. , pages #67-70.95 Watson, Lyall, Supernature. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1973.Playfair, Guy L. and Hill, Scott, The Cycles of Heaven. New York: St. Martin’sPress, 1978.- 60 -develop their magical abilities and those who permit them to atrophy as theysink back to an existenceharmonious with the objective universe. 96The years of the Aeon of HarWer were confused, and I do not wish to think ofthem save ascuriosities. But I wish to remember the Church of Satan and the Magus of thatAge.Therefore let the years of my Aeon be counted from the conception of the Churchof Satan.The Æon of Horus (commenced 1904 CE) has left few legacies of practical value tothe magician. Thosethat do exist are heavily tinged with error and inaccuracy. Worthwhileprinciples may be identified only byindividuals who already possess the sophistication of judgment to formulatethose principles themselves.This is an important point - usually taken, unfortunately, only by those who donot need to.Anton Szandor LaVey and the Church of Satan are held in honor by Set, hence bythe Temple of Set. TheAge of Satan was a necessary catalyst to the Æon of Set, and all of itsexperiences, whether pleasant orpainful, have been important to the realization and implementation of the Æon.In subtle yet enduringreminder of this, the dating system employed by the Church of Satan (1966 CE = IAnno Satani) is to becontinued by the Temple of Set, with the initials A.S. [or ÆS] now signifying“Æon of Set”.And now, having looked upon the past with affection and reverence, we shall turnour gazeto the times before us. Think carefully of the Word of Set, for it is given inwitness to myBond.Many factors have gone into the design of the Æon of Set - among them the legacyof ancient Egypt; thework of John Dee, Aleister Crowley, and Anton LaVey; and the contributions ofinnumerable theorists,magicians, and metaphysicians. Each is to be appreciated as appreciation is due;yet the orientation of theTemple of Set must be to the future - to the development of the new Æon and itsunprecedented identity.The Word of Set has been discussed above. Concerning the Bond see the Statementof Belial in theDiabolicon.Behold, O West, I have established my Aeon. I punish the enemies who are in it,placed in thePlace of Destruction. I deliver them to the examiners from whose guard there isno escape.Lo, I pass near to thee, I pass near to thee.This passage is conspicuous for its style, which lends itself to precisehieroglyphic translation. The“Place of Destruction” is the Tuat, of which Budge has written:The meaning of the name Tuat is unknown, and it is useless to speculate upon itor inventetymologies for it; it was applied to the home of the beatified spirits and thedamned, no doubt inpredynastic times, and the exact meaning it conveyed to the minds of those whofirst used it hasbeen lost. To describe its general situation is less difficult, but not manydetails as to its exact extentare forthcoming.To find a word which shall at once describe the situation and character of theTuat isimpossible, for the reason that the Egyptian conception of the place of departedspirits is unique.The Tuat is not the “Lower Hemisphere” because it is not under the ground, and,though for want ofa better word I have frequently used “Underworld” when speaking of the Tuat, itis unsatisfactory;for, unless it is specifically defined to mean the place of departed spirits ingeneral, it produces awrong impression in the mind. Again, the word Tuat must not be rendered by“Hades” or “Hell” or“Sheol” or “Jehannum”, for each of these words has a limited and specialmeaning. On the otherhand, the Tuat possessed the characteristics of all of these names, for it wasan “unseen” place, andit contained abysmal depths of darkness, and there were pits of fire in itwherein the enemies of thegods were consumed, and certain parts of it were the homes of monsters invarious shapes andforms which lived upon the unfortunate creatures whom they were able to destroy.97According to the Book of Gates, 98 the first region of the Tuat was called Set-Amentet, and also theWestern Gate. 9996 Lovecraft, H.P., “The Silver Key” and “Through the Gates of the Silver Key”in At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels.Sauk City: Arkham House, 1964.97 Budge, The Egyptian Heaven and Hell. La Salle: Open Court, 1974, pages#87-88.98 Ibid., page #85.99 Ibid., page #100.[index-61_1.png]- 61 -Affix now my image as it was given to you, so that all who read of these mattersmay nowlook upon the likeness of Set.Approximately a month prior to the North Solstice X, I happened to be lookingthrough some books ofancient art. Among the illustrations were some mutilated images of Set, and Irecalled Budge’s commentthat no known portraits of the god had survived unmutilated. 100 Feeling asudden sympathy for this “oldmythological figure”, I decided to create at least one picture that was neithermutilated nor commercial.After doing this, I surrounded it with hieroglyphs - the phrase “Let my greatnobles be brought to me” whichwould unexpectedly reappear in the Book of Coming Forth by Night. Satisfied withthe design, I relegated itto my archives, presumably indefinitely. On the North Solstice, at approximately4:30 AM, it was appendedto the manuscript.The Word of the Aeon of Set isEach magical Æon is characterized by a philosophy, which may be summarized by aFormula, whichmay in turn be summarized by a Word. The Magus of an Æon “Utters its Word”, i.e.he formulates andexplains the new philosophy. 101Although Crowley speaks of only three historic Æons (Isis, Osiris, and Horus),he identifies eight Magi:Lao-Tzu, Gotama Buddha, Krishna, Tehuti (Thoth), Moses, Dionysis (Christ),Mohammed, and himself.Anton Szandor LaVey is the ninth, his number is Nine, and his Word isIndulgence. The Formula of theAge of Satan was an expansion of this Word: Indulgence Instead of Abstinence.102I am therefore the tenth, appearing in the year X, and it has been my Task andCurse to Utter the WordXeper. This is the Egyptian hieroglyphic term for “to become/to be/to come intobeing”, and it waspersonified by the god Xepera (Kheph-Ra). This god was portrayed as the scarabbeetle, symbolizing Self-generation and the dawn.Summarily the Word Xeper refers to the transformation and evolution of the Willfrom a human to adivine state of being - by deliberate, conscious, individual force of mind.The Formula of the Æon of Set is XXX = Xepera Xeper Xeperu = “I Have Come IntoBeing and CreatedThat Which Has Come Into Being.” Concerning this then-Magister [now Ipsissimus]Don Webb commentedin 1995:I’ve traced the Xepera Xeper Xeperu formula, which Budge got from theBremmer-Rhindpapyrus, to the XX Dynasty. It is a protective formula on the back of a statueof Rameses III, inwhich Rameses III portrayed himself as Xepera.It is not unreasonable to suspect that the formula is/was the personal propertyof Set priests ofTanis, from whom Rameses III is descended. Rameses III’s reign, as that of hisfather Setnakt, isdetailed in the Great Harris Papyrus.Budge was one of its first translators, and sentences from it show up in many ofhis books,including “He did may glorious things as king ( suten)”, which also appears inthe Book of ComingForth by Night.The same papyrus describes Setnakt as having the rage of the god KhepriSet onthe battlefield.The effect of such few men as Seti, Rameses II, Setne, Seti II, Setnakt, RamesesIII, Rameses IV andRameses VI on us is amazing. Outdoing them will be hard work. 103100 Budge, The Mummy, pages #276-277.101 The Task of a Magus is to Utter his Word. The Curse of a Magus is that,since he necessarily Utters his Word in anenvironment unfamiliar with it, few will initially comprehend or tolerate thatWord.102 Crowley, The Book of Lies.

Aquino VI° Temple of Set Santa Barbara, California,1979 CE"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONOn March 18, 1904 Aleister Crowley and his wife Rose visited the old BoulakMuseum in Cairo. She drew hisattention to the XXVI Dynasty funerary stele of the Theban priest Ankh-f-n-Khonsu.Represented on this stele are two Egyptian god-figures and a winged solar disc,which Crowley identifiedrespectively as Nuit, Ra- Hoor-Khuit, and Hadit. He thought Ra-Hoor-Khuit to bea form of Horus the Younger (theEgyptological term for the son of Osiris and Isis in the Osirian mythos) andthus the symbol of an “æon of the son”to follow those of the mother-goddess (Isis) and the father-god (Osiris). Healso believed Hadit to be “Heru-pa-kraath” (Harpokrates), the infant form of Horus the Younger. He identified Nuit[correctly] as the Egyptian goddessof the sky.An examination of the hieroglyphs on the stele - called by Crowley the “Stele ofRevealing” - indicates thatit was not conceived or executed according to the Osirian mythos [save that thedead priest is referred to as “anOsiris”, i.e. a dead soul].“Ra-Hoor-Khuit” is correctly translated to “Ra-Harakte, Master of the Gods”.This is a form of HarWer (Horusthe Elder - the Great Horus of pre-Osirian legend), literally “Horus of theHorizon” in his solar aspect ofXepera. Ra-Harakte had been the judge of the dead in non-Osirian Egypt, and hewas also cast as the champion ofSet in the Osirian-mythos trial between Set and Horus the Younger.The curious term “Hadit” is simply the Islamic word for a divinely-inspiredutterance of any sort; hence itis not found on the XXVI Dynasty monument. The “Hadit” disc is hieroglyphicallyidentified on the stele as“Behdety”, a form of Horus the Elder worshipped at Behdet in the eastern Niledelta. Summarily the Stele ofRevealing is not based upon the Osirian triad at all; its themes are those of aTheban Sun-cult based upon Horusthe Elder and Ra- Harakte.This casts an entirely new light on the Book of the Law that Crowley transcribedon April 8-10, 1904. Heinterpreted the chapters and verses of this document according to hisunderstanding of the figures on the Stele ofRevealing, and these interpretations have been published as The Law is for All(Ed. Regardie), Magical andPhilosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law (Ed. Symonds& Grant), and The Commentaries of AL (Ed. Motta). Crowley’s account of the CairoWorking - thetranscription of the Book of the Law - is contained in The Equinox, TheConfessions, and The Equinox of theGods.The concepts introduced in the Book of Coming Forth by Night make possible anentirely new analysis of theBook of the Law. This should be understood neither as an æsthetic criticism ofCrowley’s comments nor as anattempted distortion of them. It is rather the result of the perceptualvantage-point of the Æon of Set as opposed tothat of the Æon of Horus. The original Comment to the Book of the Law forbadeall discussion or criticism of thattext, not unjustifiably on the presumption that initiates below the grade ofMagus could not evaluate it withÆonic perspective. As an Ipsissimus I assert a trans-æonic perspective, hencethe right - even responsibility - tocomment accordingly on the Book of the Law.A Note About Æons ...As far as most occultists are aware, references to æons began with AleisterCrowley’s much-advertised Æon ofHorus, which he proclaimed to have followed first the Æon of Isis (roughly pre-Christian paganism) and thenthat of Osiris (roughly 2,000 years of Christianity). Since Crowley’sunderstanding of Egyptian mythology wasessentially that of the Osiris/Isis/Horus trinity, this tied Westerncivilization up into a nice, neat package.Not only was Crowley responsible for bringing about the Æon of Horus, we aretold, but that of Osiris as well- in a previous incarnation as the High Priest of Osiris [and Priestess of Isis]Ankh- f-n-khonsu. The detailed storyof this is told in his memoir of that incarnation, “Across the Gulf”, in Equinox#I-7:But Thoth the mighty god, the wise one, with his ibis- head and his nemyss ofindigo, with his Ateph crownand his phœnix wand and with his ankh of emerald, with his magic apron in thethree colors; yea, Thoth,the god of wisdom, whose skin is of tawny orange as though it burned in afurnace, appeared visibly to all- 68 -of us. And the old Magus of the Well, whom no man had seen outside his well fornight threescore years,was found in the midst; and he cried with a loud voice, saying, “The Equinox ofthe Gods!”And he went about to explain how it was that Nature should no longer be thecenter of man’s worship,but man himself, man in his suffering and death, man in his purification andperfection. And he recited theFormula of the Osiris as follows, even as it hath been transmitted unto us bythe Brethren of the Cross andRose unto this day ...In his own writings Crowley does not indicate where he came by this concept of“æons” or exactly what ismeant by it. A little detective work, however, takes us back to the days of theGolden Dawn and the writing of abook entitled Egyptian Magic by Florence Farr, Scribe of the G.'.D.'., in 1896.This book, part of a 10-volume seriesCollectanea Hermetica edited by W.W. Westcott, contained a very interestingchapter called “The Gnostic Magic ofEgypt”:Let us first consider the essential principles of Gnosticism, which are brieflyas follows:First - A denial of the dogma of a personal supreme God, and the assertion of asupreme divineessence consisting of the purest light and pervading that boundless space ofperfected matter which theGreeks called the Pleroma. This light called into existence the great father andthe great mother whosechildren were the æons or god-spirits. That is to say from the supreme issuesthe nous or divine mindand thence successive emanations, each less sublime than the preceding. Thedivine life in each becomingless intense until the boundary of the Pleroma, or the fullness of God, isreached. From thence therecomes into being a taint of imperfection, an abortive and defective evolution,the source of materiality andthe origin of a created universe, illuminated by the divine but far removed fromits infinitude and perfection.Now the Gnostics considered that the actual ruler and fashioner of this createduniverse and its beingsgood and evil was the Demiurgos, a power issuant from sophia or wisdom. By someit was said that thedesire of souls for progression caused the origin of a universe in which theymight evolve and rise to thedivine.The Gnostics definitely believed in the theory of cycles of ascent and return tothe evolutionaryprogress of worlds, ages, and man; the ascents & descents of the soul; thepre-existence of all human soulsnow in worldly life; and the surety that all souls that desire the highest mustdescend to matter and be bornof it. They were the philosophical Christians.The rule of the Christian church, however, fell into the hands of those whoencouraged an emotionalreligion, destitute of philosophy, whose members should be bound together bypersonal ties of humansympathy with an exalted sufferer and preacher rather than by an intellectualacceptance of high truth.The Gnostics dissented from the creed then being taught, on the ground of theinferiority of thehero- worship of Christ to the spiritual knowledge of the supernal mind, whichthey considered he taught.The Gnostics were almost universally deeply imbued with the doctrines ofSocrates and Plato; and areligion of emotion and reverence, combined with moral platitudes, did not seemto them of a sublimitysufficiently intense to be worthy to replace the religious mysteries of Egypt,India, and Persia, thetheocracy of the Jews, or the sublime truths hidden in the myths of Greece.In Religion in Ancient History S.G.F. Brandon comments:In his “First Epistle to the Corinthians” Paul had occasion to contrast histeaching with that of othersystems known to his readers. In so doing he was led to give this significantaccount of his own: “Howbeitwe speak wisdom among the perfect: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of therulers of this world,which are coming to naught: but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even thewisdom that hath beenhidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory: which none ofthe rulers of this worldknoweth: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory”(ii. 6-8).In our official English translations the proper meaning of this passage isobscured at two crucialpoints. The Greek word translated as “world” here, severally in its singular orplural forms, is aion, whichdoes not mean this physical world or Earth, but “time” or “age”.]Paul’s use of aion here accordingly shows that he was thinking in terms of anesoteric system of“world- ages” that probably derived ultimately from Iranian and Babyloniansources, and that in variousforms was much in vogue in current Græco-Roman thought. Next the wordstranslated as “rulers ofthis world” ( archontes tou aionos toutou) do not refer, as is popularlysupposed, to the Roman and Jewishauthorities who were responsible for condemning Jesus to death. They denotedæmonic beings who wereassociated with the planets and believed to govern the lives of men on Earth.As Farr and Brandon both go on to observe, Gnostic Christianity was regarded asa very serious threat tothe Christian church and was intensely persecuted. Had it become prevalent, the2,000 years might have evolvedvery differently in Western civilization - with a very intellectual,philosophical, and initiatory religious climateinstead of the intolerant, ferocious, and ignorant horror of dogmaticChristianity.- 69 -Now we are beginning to see this term æon in a new light, if I may be excusedthe expression. The Æon ofHorus is not just a period of time when ideas symbolized by Horus are dominant.Rather it is a Ding ansich, a noumenon: something of purely rational apprehension, not perception bythe senses.Thus in what one might term the Lesser Black Magical sense, an æon is simply anattitude which one choosesor is conditioned to adopt. This is what is meant by saying that differentpeople “exist in different æons”: that aJew, Christian or Moslem exists in the Æon of Osiris, a Wiccan in that of Isis,and a Thelemite in that of Horus.Accordingly, while æons are “pyramidal” in sophistication, after the fashion ofPlato’s “pyramid of thought”,there is no reason to consider them time-sequential, with each new onesuperseding and obliterating the one before it.In an LBM sense, therefore, the population of the world continues overwhelminglyin the grip of the Æon ofOsiris, the best intentions of Aiwass notwithstanding. The Æon of Isis is thenext influential, followed by that ofHorus. The Æon of Set, highest on the pyramid and most difficult to comprehendand indwell, is the most rarifiedand elusive of all.As with an initiatory degree/grade system, it would be very difficult if notimpossible to spend all of one’stime in a “higher æon”. When we go about our affairs in the profane world, weare usually Osirians, peering withcuriosity and vague alarm at ecological activists (Isis) or avant-garde artists(Horus). Yet we experience periods ofIsis and Horus too - and, when we wish to, that very rarefied Æon of Set.Crowley, who suggested that æons were periods of time in “catastrophicsuccession” - I presume in order tomore forcefully advance the cause of the Æon of Horus - predicted in the Equinox#I-10 that following the ÆH“will arise the Equinox of Ma, the goddess of justice. It may be a hundred orten thousand years from now (1913),for the computation of time is not here as there.” In 1921, in his “new comment”to Liber Legis, Crowleyspeculated that the next æon would be that of Thmaist, third officer in theG.'.D.'. Neophyte ritual. Yet, hecontinued, “It may be presumptuous to predict any details concerning the nextæon after this.”That is essentially my attitude as well. As Magus of the Æon of Set, I am an Eyein that particular Triangle [orShining Trapezohedron], as it were. The only one who knows for certain what thenext-conceived æon will be, ifindeed there should be one, would be the Magus or Maga who Utters its word.Above I made reference to æons “in an LBM sense”. There is a “Greater BlackMagical sense” as well:Seen through the lens of GBM, an æon is in fact a living entity, in which itsinitiates are “cells”. This is the secretwhich the Gnostics brought from antiquity, and which so frightened the Christiandogmatists. The “god” of an æonis thus a creature of the total magical and philosophical energy of materialbeings who are initiates of that æon, i.e.who are aware that they are “components of the god”. [Are you now beginning tosee the ancient origins ofHegel’s concept of an “overmind”?]Understood in this sense, a GBM working is a way of the “part’s” reaching out tocontact, experience,and/or express the “whole”. This is why true GBM is not even remotely like“prayer” as the profane practice it.Nor is it mere meditation, in which the mind of the meditator merely extends toits own limits. It is the greatestsecret, and the greatest fulfillment, of unique existence.Once an æon is apprehended in this way, a great many veils fall away, a greatmany mysteries of what magic is/why it works are revealed, and indeed the entire “why” of human consciousness isexplained. All you need is thenœsis to perceive it. Don’t be concerned if you don’t attain such nœsisimmediately. It is there; and when you areready for it, It will be ready for you.... And About Initiatory States of BeingThe concept of magical æons is further involved - one might say entangled - withthe three highestdesignations of Western initiation: Magister Templi, Magus, and Ipsissimus.These and their preliminaries are usually attributed to the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.) inturn-of-the-20th-century London. 104The G.'.D.'. never conferred the three senior grades (as they were called),reserving them to the mysterious/supernatural “Secret Chiefs”; they were thus held to be “astral” grades beyondincarnated human attainment.When Aleister Crowley founded his G.'.D.'.-superseding A.'.A.'. in 1907, he madeit possible for incarnates toattain the astral by a process of consciousness-transformation he referred to as“crossing the Abyss”. Now thegrade of Magister Templi (8)=[3] came into focus as characterizing one capableof completely comprehending(“Understanding”) an æon. A Magus (9)=[2] identifies one who creates (“Uttersthe Word of”) a completely newæon, or who significantly expands or enhances apprehension of an existing one.So far so good, but Crowley left Ipsissimus (10)=[1] floundering in vagueness:“It is beyond all this andbeyond all comprehension of those of lower degrees.” 105104 Nevertheless they go back considerably farther. G.'.D.'. founder Dr WynnWestcott adapted them from the elder SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia (founded by Robert Little in 1866), which in turn hadadapted them from the Gold und Rosenkreuz, aPrussian occult society (founded 1757?). Cf. Christopher McIntosh, The RoseCross and the Age of Reason: Eighteenth-Century Rosicrucianism in Central Europe and Its Relationship to theEnlightenment (Brill Academic Publishers, 1997).105 Crowley, Aleister, “One Star In Sight” , Magick (New York: Weiser, 1994).- 70 -What the Temple of Set later attributed to it is both simple and self-evident:the attainment of a perspectiveabove and beyond all existing æons, enabling the Ipsissimus to harmoniously andbeneficially integrate them. 106Where the Book of the Law is concerned, what this means is that, as theinauguration and Utterance of theWord of the Æon of Horus, it should [in 1904] have instantly redefined Crowleyas a Magus. Nevertheless he didnot claim even Magister Templi until 1909, nor Magus until 1914. He neverexplained this awkward - and glaring -discrepancy. Moreover he did not initiatorily formalize the Æon until thefounding of the A.'.A.'. in 1907, nor publishthe Book of the Law itself until The Equinox #I-7 in 1912.And so with the Book of the Law we do not have a nice, neat package ofhuman/divine interaction, but a collageof attention and reflection which gradually emerged only over several decades.106 Until the Temple of Set evolved these grades into its degree structure in1975, they had never been even theoreticallyachievable by females. Setians Recognize them correspondingly as MagistraTempli, Maga, and Ipsissima.The First Chapter1.Had! The Manifestation of Nuit.This chapter is a verbalization of the Nuit-neter as perceived by Crowley.[Throughout this commentarythe term “neter” (hieroglyphic ntr) is used in the Pythagorean/Platonic sense asa first and/or comprehensiveUniversal principle.] As the Egyptian sky-neter, Nuit was portrayed as themother of Set, Horus the Elder,Ra, and Xepera.2.The unveiling of the company of heaven.The Book of the Law constitutes an explanation of concepts derived from thesefive neteru. HarWer iscompletely manifest, as is necessary for the Equinox of the Æon of Horus. TheXeper-neter is partiallyrevealed through passages in the text dealing with transformation and evolution.The neter of Set wouldremain unrecognized and enigmatic, its presence but not identity sensed, untilthe announcement of the Æonof Set on the North Solstice of X/1975.3.Every man and every woman is a star.A star is a completely-contained environment of matter, energy, and the processof conversion betweenthe two. Once formed, a star is an island of existence unique unto itself amidstthe Universe, interactingcomparatively remotely with other celestial bodies and phenomena throughradiation and gravitation. Theconstitution of each uniquely self-conscious human being ( homo sapiens) issimilar; one’s interactions withother beings and with one’s environment have the capacity to be dwarfed by theself-containedconsciousness of the non- natural intellect. Ultimately the self-createdperceptual universe (SubjectiveUniverse/SU) of the magician can surpass the stimuli and consequences of thenatural, material one(Objective Universe/OU).4.Every number is infinite; there is no difference.This principle was later revealed as an important key to #II-76 by the Book ofComing Forth by Night.Crowley’s extensive essay on the subject in both 777 and his 1920 Comment isexcellent and deserves athoughtful reading.According to Pythagoras and his Egyptian initiatory sources, numbers are the“building-blocks” ofexistence: They are not Forms per se, but are rather the “alphabet” throughwhich many Forms are madecomprehensible. 107If Nuit is considered to represent the expanse of the natural, material universe(OU), then theinclusion of this statement in this first chapter assumes additionalsignificance. Numbers are infinite. Forexample, there can be countless manifestations of things which are viewed asquarters of wholes or asquartets of complete wholes. At the same time the “4-principle” is rigid initself and is thus a fixed componentof the OU.5.Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men!The “warrior lord of Thebes” is Amon (Amun/Amen), the patron warrior-neter ofThebes ( Uast), generallyportrayed as a ram or as a man wearing a twin-plumed headdress. This statementsuggests theforthcoming catalyst of the Age of Satan [or Set/HarWer], symbolized by the Ramof Mendes ( Ba-neb-Tettu), as a transitional phase between the Æons of Horus and Set. Note theemphasis given to the term“Children”, implying an elect body of initiates rather than the human species asa whole.6.Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue!“Hadit” means “inspired utterance”. “Had” is also the “secret center” of theword Abrahadabra,described by Crowley as the Magical Formula of the Æon of Horus. The “abra”prefix & suffix eachtranslate hieroglyphically as “heart of Ra” or “purification of Ra”, which wouldrender the entire Formulaas an “inspired utterance from the heart of Ra”.107 An excellent introduction is Peter Gorman’s Pythagoras: A Life (London:Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979). For a [much] moreextensive treatment, the 2- volume set The Secrets of Ancient Geometry by TonsBrunes (Copenhagen, Denmark: “TheAncient Geometry” [Nygaardsvej 41, Copenhagen 0], 1968).- 72 -7.Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor- paar-kraat.Harpokrates is Horus the Younger, the later Osirian corruption of the GreatHorus (HarWer). Hencethe authenticity of Aiwass as an OU entity seems doubtful. More probably he is aSU idealization of Crowley’sown personality. The Book of the Law is most coherently viewed as an “inspiredutterance” of the neteruidentified in #I-1 and #I-2, not a statement by Aiwass on behalf of a corruptedgod-image.8.The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs.Khabs is the hieroglyphic term for the gods of the 36 Dekans [or for stellargods in general]. Khu maybe translated from the hieroglyphic in several ways. Crowley preferred “spirit”.It may also mean “fire” or“flame”. Corresponding translations would be: “The stellar gods are conceived byone’s spirit; they do notimpart it.” -or- “The stellar gods are within the flame; they do not create it.”108If the “spirit” or “flame” is presumed to be the Black Flame of primal separateintelligence109identified in the Diabolicon, then the two translations are identical.The stellar neteru [as opposed tothose signified by other symbols] are identified as aspects or Forms of thePrimal Form of separateintelligence.9.Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you.Attention is properly directed towards the stellar neteru and what theysymbolize. One personification ofthese neteru [according to the imagery of the Age of Satan] may be found in theDiabolicon. Other, morecomplex interpretations are now being developed through the Orders of the Templeof Set. 11010. Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known.This affirms the principle of initiatory elitism [as opposed to egalitarianmob-rule]. The recurrent tragedyof human political history is that, whenever the elitist principle is abandonedde facto - whether or not it waspreviously admitted de jure - corruption and disintegration of the host cultureinvariably results.11. These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools.A sharp and succinct statement concerning the inauthenticity of the world’sprior religious systems.Crowley disregarded this admonition, needlessly encumbering his speculations andcalculations concerningthe Book of the Law with irrelevant myth-material from Buddhism, Hinduism, andCabalism. If the resultswere so often confusing and inconclusive, he had no one to blame but himself.12. Come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love!Crowley interprets this straightforwardly as a statement that sexual or artisticlove should be indulgedopenly and innocently, and that an empathy with Nuit will be one of theconsequences. It may also be thatone’s vision, magical abilities, and emotional sensitivity will be heightened atnight, when Solar light andradiation are at least partially shielded. 111108 Cf. J. Norman Lockyear, The Dawn of Astronomy (Cambridge: MIT Press,1964). Lockyear, an eminent 19th-century British astronomer, developed a theorythat the Egyptian neteru - and the temples andartifacts dedicated to them - were closely integrated with astronomicalphenomena. Although he accompanied his argument withextensive documentation, the theory was initially considered too radical to havesubstance. Recent archæological discoverieshave prompted the reprinting and reconsideration of this book.109 The Diabolicon is a retelling of the legend of John Milton’s Paradise Lostas seen through the eyes of Satan and his fellowarchdæmons. It was composed by me over the first several months of 1970 inVietnam and “nearby areas”, and whencomplete was sent to Anton LaVey as a gift to the Church of Satan, wherein itbecame a keystone of its mythology until1975. It is reprinted in my The Church of Satan ebook. The “Black Flame” was themedium by which humanity wasawakened to self-conscious isolate existence (the “great sin” of Satan and thoseinspired of him.110 The classic 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey represented the Black Flame asa rectangular monolith as a less-shocking version of Arthur Clarke’s overtly-Satanic Childhood’s End. Historically as theGreek Promethean Fire, the Spear of Odin, and similar images it has appearedthroughout human history. Within the Templeof Set are several specialized Orders, each focusing upon differentmanifestations of the Gift of Set (as it is now called).111 The A.'.A.'. might arguably be described as the G.'.D.'. plus sex, and theO.T.O. as Freemasonry plus sex. It certainly madeboth successor organizations more fun then their predecessors.- 73 -13. I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see yourjoy.A straightforward sexual statement concealing a more subtle truth: The essenceof the Gift of Set,emitted from the stars, is captured and sustained in the persons of the Elect.The intelligence of the Gift, bothchaotic (HarWer) and composed (Set), takes pleasure in the generation andpreservation of similarqualities in the Elect. For their part, the Elect experience a uniqueexhilaration at night, especially whenexposed to starlight.14. Above, the gemmèd azure isThe naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kissThe secret ardours of Hadit.The wingèd globe, the starry blue,Are mine, O Ankh-f-n-Khonsu.Crowley’s poetic rendering of the juxtaposition of Nuit and “Hadit” on the Steleof Revealing. Hismisidentification of Behdety is again apparent, as the lover of Nuit was a godof the Earth, not [either] Horus.This verse - an excerpt of a longer poem included by Crowley in “The Temple ofSolomon the King”in Equinox#I-7 - does not appear in his original Liber Legis manuscript, which raises thequestion why, despiteAiwass’ admonitions to the contrary, Crowley later modified what he published asthe Book of the Law.The name “Ankh-f-n-Khonsu” translates to “[He whose] Life is in Khonsu”. Khonsuor Khons was theMoon-neter of Thebes, son of the family triad Amon/Mut/Khons. By the time of theXXVI Dynasty, thepriesthoods at Thebes and Memphis were among the few remaining non-Osiriancenters of learning. During theNew Empire, Amon was usually combined with Ra as Amon-Ra, which explains theSolar disc and Ra-Harakteon the stele of a Theban priest.15. Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is theprince-priestthe Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given. Theyshall gathermy children into their fold: they shall bring the glory of the stars into thehearts of men.“Infinite space” [of the OU] characterizes Nuit. The initiatory role andauthority of Crowley and his ScarletWoman are herein defined. They are charged to bring the A.'.A.'. into existenceand to promulgate its doctrinesto society in general. Both of these tasks they indeed undertook, and theirsuccessful accomplishment was anecessary precondition of the Age of Satan and Æon of Set.16. For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secret flame,and to her thestooping starlight.Crowley interpreted this verse as a simple identification of the Beast andScarlet Woman with “Hadit”and Nuit respectively. He further hypothesized an analogy to the Yang/Yininterrelationship of Chinesecosmology. To me this latter interpretation seems more substantive, implying asit does that complementarymagical influences would be required for the Æon of Horus to exert its fullinfluence.17. But ye are not so chosen.Crowley excuses this particular comment as being directed to “the otherworshippers of Nuit” besides theScarlet Woman and himself. I read it as establishing to all readers of the Bookof the Law that there would bebut one “prince-priest the Beast”. The pathetic posturing of the manyself-proclaimed “reincarnations” ofAleister Crowley speaks for itself.18. Burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent!The Uræus cobra, worn on the forehead, was the symbol of Egyptian kingship. Moreprecisely, the pharaoh’srole was that of a priest-king: a divinely inspired and sanctioned guardian ofthe initiatory Elect of Egypt. Nuitannounces Crowley’s ascent to this station as Magus of the Æon. Once again theauthenticity of the Book ofthe Law is subtly evidenced, as the exclusive symbolism of the Uræus isunmistakable. “This is the Uræuswhich came forth from Set.” - Utterance #683, Pyramid Texts.19. O azure-lidded woman, bend upon them!Nuit is the “azure-lidded woman”. Considered together with verse #I-18, thisimplies that the priest-king powers and perceptions of the Beast and Scarlet Woman will be more fullyrealized during the hours of- 74 -darkness. Horus, however, is a deity of daylight; consider the three 12-1 PMtransmissions of the Book of theLaw itself.20. The key of the rituals is in the secret word which I have given unto him.Crowley believed this word to be “Abrahadabra”, symbolizing the union ofcomplementary conceptsthrough ritual. He explored its construction via Cabalistic numerologicaltechniques, arriving at variousnumbers which he believed significant to the Æon of Horus. While the HebrewCabala possesses no OUvalidity, Crowley insisted - presumably as a consequence of his G.'.D.'.training - upon trying to use it as adevice for systematizing his philosophy. His diaries reveal his exhaustiveefforts in this vein and the manypointless “results” he achieved.Exactly how Crowley used “Abrahadabra” as a ritual key is obscure. He didobserve that it contains 11letters, and that the (1)=[10], (2)=[9], (3)=[8], etc. grades of the G.'.D.'.and A.'.A.'. incorporated anelevenfold base [which was rather at odds with the tenfold Cabalistic Tree ofLife]. He also felt the word to bea “corrected” version of the older term “abracadabra” (a pyramidal word-puzzlebased upon the a-b- c-dsequence).21. With the God & the Adorer I am nothing: they do not see me. They are as uponthe earth; I amHeaven, and there is no other God than me, and my lord Hadit.Crowley saw this as describing the Stele of Revealing. I read it rather as astatement of the true natureof “God”, i.e. the mechanical, inertial cosmos (OU) (Nuit) as opposed to God thebearded dignitary on theceiling of the Sistine Chapel.The OU presence and proof of the existence of the collective neteru [or aunified “God”] is, as areuniversal truths generally, both simple and self-evident: the consistency of OUmechanisms, e.g. “naturallaw”. Such consistency, represented by Nuit, is only recognizable from anexternal point of perspective,e.g. Hadit.22. Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secretname which I willgive to him when at last he knoweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, and theInfinite Starsthereof, do ye also thus. Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made amongyou betweenany one thing & any other thing; for thereby cometh hurt.The secret name, revealed in the 12th Æthyr of Liber 418 ( The Vision and TheVoice), was that of Babylonor Babalon, incorporated by Crowley into the seal of the A.'.A.'.. Again Nuit isshown to comprise the OU.The adjuration of this passage lays bare the terrible secret of all forms ofGod/nature worship: the forcing ofall deviant will towards uniformity and conformity to the cosmic inertia.Difference or independence of anysort - particularly intellectual separation - is alien and anathema to Nuit.23. But whoso availeth in this, let him be chief of all!A Magus - (9)=[2] A.'.A.'., V° Church of Satan, or V° Temple of Set - is in factan individual whosucceeds in achieving a perspective of separation from the OU and, from thatpoint of perspective, Utteringa Word [=formulating a philosophy] to alter that universe in some fashion. Thusthe creation orenhancement of a magical æon exists not merely in the SU of the Magus, but [ashis Task] extends outwardinto the OU, changing it throughout its entire substance. The Magus thusrefashions, if only to a subtle degree,the identities of the neteru/“God”.Nuit’s reaction is predictably one of inertia. The change is resisted, but onceaccomplished it is reinforced.Once a Magus has successfully completed his Task, he becomes obsolete as suchand must either revert to thefunction of Magister Templi [since the OU now incorporates his Word] or take theoath of Ipsissimus andventure into a still-larger universe.24. I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty.25. Divide, add, multiply, and understand.Crowley divided 6 by 50 and got 0.12, which he thought might signify his 0=2equation. His otherattempts to solve the mathematical riddles of these verses were unsuccessful,though he attributed one or twoCabalistic symbols to the numbers that resulted. He did not, however, uncoverthe word of Nuit. That word is“inertia”, whose letters, numbered per the English alphabet [cf. the Book ofComing Forth byNight]=76=13=4. 50÷6=8. 50+6=56. 50x6=300. 8+56+300=364=13=4= key numberconcealing thesacred decad of Pythagoreanism (1+2+3+4=10). Cf. also Crowley’s most significantBook 4.- 75 -26. Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one: Who am I, and whatshall be thesign? So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue, all- touching,allpenetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithe body arched forlove, and hersoft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be myecstasy, theconsciousness of the continuity of existence, the unfragmentary non-atomic factof myuniversality.112The response to Crowley’s appeal for confirmation of his identity was thisendorsement of his belief thathe was in fact the Beast 666. The most subtle and meaningful of all signs wasgiven - a reminder of his ability tosense the omnipresence and comprehensiveness of Nuit. Such an experience wouldhave been impossible forone of lesser vision than a Magus, because a Magus, by definition, must firstcomprehend the totality of whatpresently exists before Uttering a Word to exert change upon it.27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovelybrows, and thedew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: ONuit,continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as Onebut asNone; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!Crowley’s ecstatic recognition of the sign, and hope that mankind generally willnot transcend inertia byachieving a point of perspective similar to his [from which Nuit may be seen“from outside”]. Presumablythis follows #I-5 and #I- 10, in which only Elect initiates may presume to “seethe goddess unveiled”.28. None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two.Nuit validates the concept that she is all-inclusive, hence cannot bedistinguished from any other thingknown to her. [The Set/HarWer juxtaposition is distinct and apart from the OU.]Yet the OU is not ahomogenous whole; it is everywhere separated into complementary parts: +/-magnetic fields, matter/antimatter, mass/energy,light/darkness,heat/cold, etc.It is the interaction ofthese parts which engendersthe mechanism of time and mathematics.29. For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union.Love is the highest expression of complementary attraction, for it is bothOUniversal and elusively non-mechanical: the ultimate field-phenomenon of the neteru. It is the inexplicableaffection between twosentient beings and the equally- inexplicable gravity between two insensatelumps of matter.30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing,and the joy ofdissolution all.Division - the forced separation of a homogenous whole into parts - isdisruptive, hence painful to theinertia of Nuit. Dissolution of components through their union with complementsis joyful, insofar as thehomogenous whole is thus restored. The statement argues against division and forthe reunion of the whole.Again this tendency of the Nuit-neter confirms its true identity as such.31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feellittle; what is, is balancedby weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones.Crowley need not worry about obstructions to the unification of Nuit resultingfrom the emotional andintellectual spasms of uninitiated mankind. These are balanced by complementaryforces - joy for pain,satisfaction for curiosity, the death-wish for the life-force, etc. Henceintellectual or emotional ventures willbe neutralized before they stray so far from the pattern as to recognize it forwhat it is. And the initiatesknown to Nuit are only those who seek to hasten reunification of the whole.112 Within the modern Thelemic community the 1904 Liber Legis manuscript isidentified as Liber 31, while typeset versions areredesignated Liber 220. Unsurprisingly both Crowley and later editors madevarious modifications to such printed versions,such as his insertion of the #I-14 poem and the replacement of the final phraseof #I-26 with “the omnipresence of my body”.How exercised the reader gets about such revision depends upon whether LiberLegis is regarded as a direct statementfrom the neteru or an interpretation through the lens of Crowley’s mentality[and of well-meaning editors after him].My own commentary is not “pure”: I have taken the text from what I concludedwere the most painstaking printedsources [as cited in my Introduction], because the prospect of trying to workfrom Crowley’s ghastly scrawls exceeded mymasochistic threshold.- 76 -32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Thenthe joys ofmy love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by the vault of mybody; by mysacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all.Nuit admonishes Crowley not to stray from the goal of reunion. Dissolution ofthe self into Nuit bringsan end to all self-consciousness and thus from pain. The ultimate argument ofNuit is for suicide of the finiteself in order to become part of the infinite whole. [Cf. Crowley’s discussion ofthe “annihilation of the self”via the “crossing of the Abyss” between Adeptus Exemptus (7)=[4] and MagisterTempli (8)=[3] in OneStar in Sight.]33. Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the Queen ofHeaven; Writeunto us the ordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us the law!Crowley desires the means for reunion with the whole to be explained to him interms of ordeals (stressesnecessary to destroy the self), rituals (mental and physical exercises to bringinitiates closer to Nuit), and law(commandments that are to be obeyed to achieve the reunion).34. But she said: the ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known andhalf concealed: theLaw is for all.Nuit refuses to identify the suicide “ordeal” required of separate personalitiesfor absorption into thewhole. The procedures for the rituals will be imparted, but the weakening of theself resulting from thoserituals will not be identified for what it actually is. The Law - that Nuitinsists the reunion be pursued - is all-embracing: integral with the neter of Nuit.35. This that thou writest is the threefold book of Law.Identification of the name of the Book of the Law.36. My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in oneletter change thisbook; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khu-it.The Book of the Law is not to be altered, edited, or abridged in any way byCrowley, though he maycomment upon it in order to explain its relevance to the Æon of Horus. Thereason that the text may not betouched by that Magus is that it contains formulæ recognizable only after theÆon of Horus, as is evidentfrom this commentary and the contents of the Book of Coming Forth by Night.37. Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wandand the workof the sword; these he shall learn and teach.Ceremonial and operative magical procedures are among the tools that the Beastis to use for thecommunication of his Word. The suit of Wands in the Tarot covers aspects ofpositive existence; the suitof Swords covers aspects of force and destruction. The path of the Æon of Horuswould seem evident,particularly against the tableaus set forth in the second and third chapters ofthe Book of the Law.38. He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.A Magus must Utter his Word; that is, he is compelled to explain hisphilosophical principle.Nevertheless he may choose those for whom he deems such explanation educationaland beneficial. Pearlsneed not be cast before swine.39. The word of the Law is θελη∝α.[In English: Thelema.] Crowley explained this concept as “harmony of Will andAction”, but he alsowondered if it might not also have “probably a very lofty secretinterpretation”. That interpretation isdecipherable once the word of Nuit - inertia - is known. What is understood bythe term “Will” is anexpression of mental separateness from Nuit, in that the self is impressing itsdesire for inertial change uponNuit.By definition, then, the separate Will cannot be harmonious. Harmony withNuit can occur only whenthe separate Will is destroyed and the mind mechanically fused with the inertiaof the OU. This notion hasbeen expressed as “oneness with God”, nirvana, etc. From the standpoint of Nuitthis is immortalization ofthe Will; from the standpoint of the individual apart from Nuit it is suicide.- 77 -Contained in the concept is the principle that the individual Will can beweakened and destroyed only bythe separate being possessing it. It is not “of Nuit” and cannot be directlyinfluenced by that neter.Within the context of the Æon of Horus, then, Thelema could be seen as the“sane” alternative tochaotic behavior, since the essence and presence of Set were as yet concealed.40. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into theword. For there aretherein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth. Do whatthou wiltshall be the whole of the Law.Crowley advanced a Cabalistic interpretation thus: The = the Hermit [of theTarot] = “invisible yetilluminating”. le = the Lover = “visible as is the lightning-flash - the Collegeof Adepts”. ma = “the man ofEarth - the Blasted Tower”. He went on to add the Cabalistic/numerologicalvalues of these three cards andobtained 31 (“AL”+“LA”), whence came the secret name of the Book of the Law.The famous final sentence of this passage, originating [like “Thelema”] in Dr.Francois Rabelais’ novelGargantua, had also been used by Sir Francis Dashwood who inscribed FAY CE QUEVOUDRAS over themain entrance to Medmenham Abbey.Crowley, in adopting it, applied it specifically to “one’s true will” - which,according to the Word ofthe Æon of Horus, meant the uniting of the individual will with that of the OU(Nuit).41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! Olover, if thou wilt,depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is acurse. Accursed!Accursed! be it to the aeons. Hell.Compare the Magical Formula of the Age of Satan (1966- 1975 CE): “Indulgenceinstead of Abstinence.”Crowley interprets “love” in a sexual context, but the comment concerning unionof the divided implies theneutralization of complementary opposites by fusion - the compulsion of Nuit.[See #I-29 through #I-32.] Allimpulses other than those which lead towards such reunion and neutralization areseen as a curse, and theyare collectively characterized as Hell. This is not inconsistent with thesymbolism of the Diabolicon and theAge of Satan that succeeded the Æon of Horus.42. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thouhast no right but todo thy will.“Hell” is further described as “that state of manyhood”, i.e. a variety ofdistinct and separate wills,which, from the standpoint of Nuit, is a condition “bound and loathing”. Compareagain the Diabolicon.Again the charge is given that polarized intellects “have no right” but to “dothy will” - a meaninglessaphorism except as interpreted per #I-39.43. Do that, and no other shall say nay.The human intellectual separation from Nuit is the only such manifestation onEarth. Once this “flaw”has been “corrected”, the natural inertia of Earth will have been restored.There are no other intellectscapable of achieving a sense of separateness - of “saying nay”, as it were. 11344. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, isin every wayperfect.Will “delivered from the lust of result” and without “purpose” is independenceof will destroyed. Theconcept of will then becomes completely meaningless except as identified withthe cosmic inertia as a whole.This would in fact be “perfection” from the standpoint of Nuit.45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!Perfection as defined by Nuit consists of unity. Once it has been achieved, itbecomes a meaninglessconcept, since there will be none apart from it to appreciate that unity.The113 Arkte Element of the Temple of Set, emergent from the Word Arkte Utteredin 2000 by Maga Lilith Aquino, has brokenthrough this “natural law” into a new awareness and appreciation of non-humananimal consciousness.- 78 -46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call iteight, eighty, fourhundred & eighteen.In that fulfillment of the Law would reduce all intellectual existence to unityand thus obliteration,“nothing” is indeed a secret key to the Book of the Law! What the Jews call itis unimportant, since theHebraic/Cabalistic numerological system is OU-baseless. The sum of 8, 80, 400,and 18 is 506 = 11 = theeleven-lettered formula of Abrahadabra.47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.Another reaffirmation of the law of Nuit.48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and noneby the Book?A criticism of Crowley for his strong sense of individuality and subconsciousrefusal to accept and embracethe nihilism of Nuit. [Here it appears that “fool” is to be understood in themundane sense rather than assynonym for the A.'.A.'. grade of Ipsissimus.] Nuit perceives separateintellectual existence as stupid - as areoxen - and futile according to the doctrines put forth in the Book of the Law.49. Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuithath taken his seatin the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa, who also areone. But theyare not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa the sufferer; Hoor in his secretname andsplendour is the Lord initiating.All principles of ceremonial magic not in accordance with the Book of the Laware obsolete and should nowbe discarded. Ra-Harakte “hath taken his seat in the East”: The Sun is nowdawning on the Equinox of theGods. Since the Vernal Equinox occurs at approximately March 21, it may beassumed that the statement refersto an “equally-balanced night” between the unity of Nuit and the chaos of HarWer[to be seen in the thirdchapter].Asar (Osiris) and Isa (Isis) are identified as representative of an irrelevantprinciple: that of posthumousredemption and revival. Osiris is a mythical object of popular worship; Isis issymbolic of those who equateworship with abstinence, suffering, and deprivation.Death-worship [in the biological sense as distinct from the self-obliterationsense] and worship byabstinence have no place in the Æon of Horus; they would be distracting to theactual Word of the Æon.The secret name of Hoor (the hieroglyphic Hor or Horus) is HarWer - inhieroglyphics the “Great Horus”or Horus the Elder - not the Horus [the Younger] of the Osirian mythos.50. There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! there are threeordeals in one,and it may be given in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let thefine be tried inintellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest; thus ye have star & star,system &system; let not one know well the other!Within the Æon of Horus the initiatory Order - the A.'.A.'. - may accept personsof various levels ofintelligence for appropriate pursuits within the Order. Tests and ordeals shouldbe tailored to individuals’potential as appropriate. [Consider also #I-3.] Nevertheless there should be noconfusion or blurring of thedistinction between the several intellectual levels; intelligence is adispassionate identification of elites.51. There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silverand gold; lapis lazuli &jasper are there; and all rare scents; jasmine & rose, and the emblems of death.Let himenter in turn or at once the four gates; let him stand on the floor of thepalace. Will he notsink? Amn. Ho! warrior, if thy servant sink? But there are means and means. Begoodlytherefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet winesand wines thatfoam! Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and withwhom ye will!But always unto me.Crowley considered this passage a more or less literal interpretation of theinitiatory environment theA.'.A.'. was to use. Lapis lazuli and jasper he considered symbolic of Nuit and“Hadit” respectively, and hethought jasmine and rose to represent “the two sacraments” (the male and femalesexual fluids). He referredguardedly to the “emblems of death” as the ceremonial symbols of Freemasonry -to be adopted and usedby the A.'.A.'..If the passage is indeed descriptive of an initiatory temple, then it may beread literally and a templeconstructed accordingly, complete with four gates and sinking floors [perhaps analligator pit for the quick& tidy disposal of would-be initiates who failed the tests of #I-50?].- 79 -52. If this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They are one;or saying,They are many; if the ritual be not ever unto me: then expect the direfuljudgments of RaHoor Khuit.Crowley identified “space-marks” as stars [in the sense of #I-3]. It is equallyerroneous, he said, to regardindividuals as either completely interconnected with or completely disconnectedfrom one another.By “the ritual” he understood the sex-act, taking the admonition to mean that itwas of value as a magicalritual more than as an expression of brutish lust. This is an importantdistinction in Crowley’s own magicalphilosophy and explains his interest in the later, sex-magic-intensive OrdoTempli Orientis (O.T.O.).Crowley’s magical and æsthetic approach to sex has not, it may be said, beencarried forward in thepractices of his latter- day disciples, most of whom err on either side of thedelicate balance between thesymbolic and the animalistic.53. This shall regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart & mytongue, untowhom I send this kiss. Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of theprinces, it shallnot assuage thee nor absolve thee. But ecstasy be thine and joy of earth: everTo me! To me!The impulse of Nuit is to restore natural harmony and balance to the Earth - acondition which isdistorted by the non- natural intellectual self-consciousness of mankind.Crowley’s exalted role in this designshall not exempt him from self- obliteration as well, but he is promised“ecstasy and joy” - the first fromintellectual union with the OU/Nuit and the second by return to the physicalstation of a non-intellectual,natural animal on Earth.54. Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! thou, o prophet,shall not behold allthese mysteries hidden therein.In fact the various printed versions of the Book of the Law have consistentlyomitted key elements of thehandwritten manuscript that could not be typeset. Two of these elements - theconfiguration of the codedpassage #II-76 and the grid/number matrix behind part of #III-47 - provedcrucial to their decipherment inthe Book of Coming Forth by Night.55. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them.Crowley interpreted this verse in a magical, rather than in a genealogicalsense. At first he felt the “child” tobe Charles S. Jones (Frater Achad), but then abandoned this opinion when Jonesdeveloped theories not inaccordance with Crowley’s own beliefs concerning the Æon. The matter wasunresolved at the time ofCrowley’s death, nor were his various disciples or organizationalsplinter-groups able to reach consensus uponit. The question was resolved by the Book of Coming Forth by Night precisely acentury after Crowley’s ownbirth.56. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected housecometh thatchild. Aum! All words are sacred and all prophets true; save only that theyunderstand alittle; solve the first half of the equation, leave the second unattacked. Butthat hast all inthe clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark.The “child” would be neither of the “Eastern” (oriental/Theosophical) nor of the“Western” (Cabalistic/Masonic) magical schools, but would come rather from aschool distinct from andunrecognized by both - the Church of Satan, an initiatory magical Order thatitself rejected the doctrines bothof the aforementioned systems and of Crowley’s organizations.The “child”, as Magus of the Æon of Set, necessarily had to reject the premisesof the Æon of Horus asobsolete and/or incomplete, but this same perspective and initiatorycomprehension enabled him toexplain key mysteries of the Æon of Horus that had been unresolved even byCrowley himself. Bydefinition only a Magus may completely comprehend a previous Magus - because thesuccessor possessesthe extra-æonic perspective required.Crowley’s curiosity concerning the identity of the “child” is also dismissed asfutile - a word of advicewhich he, to his continuing frustration, refused to heed.The Words of the several Magi are valid under the circumstances of theirUtterance, but each Maguswill Understand only those magical and philosophical principles encompassed byhis Word [and previousWords to the extent that it elaborates upon them].Each Word represents a new equation between the experience of the past and theproblems of the future.A Magus may use the power of his Word to better understand the past and toaddress the present, but heshould not presume that his Word will be the final solution to the indefinitefuture.- 80 -The intellect alone will enable man to confront problems purely in the realm ofthe OU, but theuninitiated intellect is inadequate where the entire OU/SU totality - includingmetaphysical realities - isconcerned. This is the realm of the Magi.57. Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let thefools mistake love;for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Chooseye well! He,my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of the fortress, and the great mysteryof the Houseof God. All these old letters of my Book are aright; but Tzaddi is not the Star.This also issecret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.Nuit is to be invoked during the hours of darkness.“Love is the law, love under will” became one of Crowley’s key aphorisms[generally used to close anydocument opened with the “Do what thou wilt” quote from #I-40]. He understood itto mean a profoundempathy with all entities of creation, guided not by fear [which he consideredthe Christian motive for love] butby deliberation.There is further a caution concerning superficial types of love. There is “pure”love for its own sake -the dove; and there is love for ulterior motives - the serpent. [Crowleyinterpreted the serpent as a symbolof Kundalini, a sex-magic force supposedly coiled at the base of the spine. Ifind the concept quaint, ifhardly to be taken seriously.]Crowley himself chose the love of the serpent, always subordinating human loveand affection to hismagical workings. As a result his love-life consisted of an endless string ofdisasters, his opinion of womenremained immature, and his experiments with sex-magic [as highlighted, forexample, in The King on theRoyal Art, one of his sex-magic diaries] were pathetic and fruitless.The “great mystery”, which Crowley declined to explain in his comments on thegrounds that it wasreserved to the highest grades of initiation, was simply that he believedsex-magic to be the most potent formof the art - explained only at the highest degrees of the O.T.O.Crowley understood “Book” as the Tarot, and the Hebrew letter Tzaddi as theEmperor trump in thatdeck. In his commentary he proceeded to explain why this passage identified thistrump as complementaryto the Star trump XVII - which I simply do not see implied by the above passageof the Book of the Law.- 81 -58. I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainly, not faith, while in life, upondeath; peaceunutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.The promise of Nuit to mankind upon its reintegration with the OU: there wouldbe nothing left to sacrifice,nor any perception of a distinct “deity”.59. My incense is of resinous wood & gums; and there is no blood therein:because of my hairthe trees of Eternity.The composition of incense for Nuit and the reason for it - the tree as a symbolof timeless existencebecause of its apparent lack of change, slow growth..60. My number is 11, as are all their numbers who are of us. The Five PointedStar, with a Circlein the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but theblue & gold areseen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.See #I-24; 5+6=11. See also the comment concerning #I-20. The five-pointed staris the Pentagram ofSet, and a red circle is the Egyptian symbol for the Sun. To non-initiates theesoteric nature of the Book ofthe Law might seem “black” (i.e. nihilistic), but in fact it is “blue & gold” (aOU-neteru- oriented initiatorysystem of magical philosophy).For the “secret glory” see again #I-30.61. But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars in thedesert thou presentlyburnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpentflametherein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thouthen be willingtogive all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Yeshall gathergoods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceedthe nationsof the earth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall yecome to my joy.I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, and covered with arich headdress.I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am allpleasure andpurple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings,and arousethe coiled splendour within you: come unto me!62. At all my meetings with you shall the priestess say - and her eyes shallburn with desire asshe stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple - To me! To me! calling forththe flameof the hearts of all in her love-chant.63. Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to mejewels! Drink tome, for I love you! I love you!64. I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of thevoluptuous night-sky.65. To me! To me!66. The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end.- 82 -The Second Chapter1.Nu! the hiding of Hadit.Within Islam, the term hadith identifies a “divinely- inspired utterance”. Theterm has no meaning inEgyptian hieroglyphic. The “Hadit”-figure on the Stele of Revealing isidentified in the inscription as Behdety,a form of HarWer, the Great Horus. This Second Chapter is intelligible if it isunderstood as an utterance ofAleister Crowley inspired by HarWer. [By contrast, the Third Chapter is in theform of a direct address bythis neter.]In this first verse Nuit is said to conceal or obscure the magician’s awarenessof HarWer. If Nuit isrecognized as the inertial neter of the OU, and if HarWer - per the Book ofComing Forth by Night - isseen as a concentration of intelligence directly opposite to Nuit, the antipodaltension between them maybe understood.2.Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I, Hadit, amthecomplement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the name of myhouse.Crowley considered Hadit to be symbolic of “infinite contraction” - a geometricpoint - and Nuit“infinite expansion” into the three geometric dimensions. The concepts have nomeaning save in puremathematics, because the former state would mean nonexistence save as a locus,and the latter a state ofexistence embracing everything - in which case “Hadit” could not think or talk,while there would be no one“else” for Nuit to talk with!“Khabs” may be translated variously [see #I-8]. Here it characterizes HarWer asa neter of “purespirit” [see #II-1].3.In the sphere I am everywhere, the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowherefound.Crowley compared this to “an old mystical definition of God - He whose centre iseverywhere andwhose circumference nowhere”. In terms of Euclidian geometry, of course, boththe center and the shell of agiven sphere can be determined. Technically the shell can be “found”; it is thephysical displacement of asphere in space. But the center has no three-dimensional existence; it haslocation only. #II-3 is thuscontradictory to fact. This statement would place HarWer completely outside ofthe OU [where such lawsapply].4.Yet she shall be known and I never.The OU may be comprehended through the logical and empirical procedures ofscience. The pureintellect, since it possesses the capacity to behave illogically, may not bedefined through logic alone. Nœticintuition is also required. Consider here the Dialogues of Plato relative to theactual identification anddefinition of a Form/ neter.5.Behold! the rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be cast away;let the goodones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go aright.Crowley understood the “old time” as a reference to the Æon of Osiris,characterized by thepredominance of death- worship religions, now to be superseded by the Æon ofHorus.He understood the ritual reference to mean that he must purge the texts of theGolden Dawn (G.'.D.'.)to ensure their compliance with the principles of the new æon.6.I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.I am Life, andthe giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.The phenomenon of isolate self-consciousness (the Gift of Set of the Book ofComing Forth by Night or“Black Flame” of the Diabolicon) distinguishes man from beast. This samecapacity enables man to perceivehis existence as distinct from that of the Nuit-cosmos, hence the finity of thatdistinct existence - eventualdeath of the self.7.I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube inthe circle.“Come unto me” is a foolish word; for it is I that go.HarWer is the creator of a new æon and the destroyer of the old one. His beingis the origin - or axle - ofthe new æon, and elaborations of the Word of that æon extend outwards from thiscore principle.- 83 -Cubical altars within magic circles were used for certain types of magicalceremonies, but the relationshipwas expanded to three dimensions in the “Cry of the 30th Æthyr” in Liber 418 (The Vision and The Voice):“This cube is surrounded by a sphere” - implying the spiritual above and beyondthe purely material.8.Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper.Harpokrates, the infant Horus the Younger of the Osirian mythos, is in fact acorruption of HarWer, theGreat Horus. Here HarWer exposes the corruption and points to a further fallacy:An intellect cannotworship itself as an “object”.9.Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but asshadows; theypass & are done; but there is that which remains.This reaffirms the opposition of HarWer to Nuit, who considers nonexistence [ofanything else] thesupreme joy [see #I-32]. Finite intellects are subject to death. Thenon-conscious whole of matter/energy(Nuit) will, however, continue to displace space indefinitely.10. O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.11. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger.12. Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not.13. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.Crowley recounts that, at this point, he resented the direction of the Book ofthe Law but was unableto cease transcribing it. At the time he was an avowed Buddhist [which, sinceBuddhists seek obliteration of theself in nirvana, is not inconsistent with his attraction to Nuit]. The SecondChapter of the Book of the Lawattacks this position with an affirmation of the independent existence of theintellect. And even the veryattempt to “deny” the intellect affirms its existence: Cogito Ergo Sum.14. Now let there be a veiling of this shrine; now let the light devour men andeat them up withblindness!Despite the glaring truth of #II-10/13, those who “don’t want to hear it” willsimply ignore it in favorof cherished fantasies. Crowley himself missed its significance altogether.Hence he also failed tounderstand that it was the HarWer aspect of his own mind that was the actualsource of this SecondChapter.15. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but withthe just I ameight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress andthe King arenot of me; for there is a further secret.In the Old Comment, which appeared in the Equinox in 1912, Crowley wrote: “I amperfect, being Not(31 LA or 61 AIN) … Which is vital, for I am None indeed. LA.” This is rather atodds with Charles StansfeldJones (Frater Achad) first revealing the AL/LA “key” to Crowley in 1919.9 is the number of the Tarot trump “The Hermit”, symbolizing [according to theBook of Thoth] theSecret Fire Khu [see #I-8 and #I-13]. Within the scope of the Æon of Horus,however, only anIpsissimus (10)=[1] - a “fool” - could perceive this.To others an intellectual evaluation of HarWer would yield 8 = “Adjustment”.Among other things thistrump signifies the displacement of an obsolete æon by a new one.Trump #1 - “The Magus” - refers to Crowley’s role “in 8” - i.e. in the new æonas the instrument ofAdjustment. This is “vital” insofar as the HarWer neter cannot manifest itselfin the OU save through themind of a material/intellectual medium.“The Empress” (trump #3) and “The Emperor” (trump#4) add to trump #7 (“The Chariot”), signifying the North Solstice and themystery of the Grail. This isindeed a “further secret”, as it is not of HarWer and would be revealed only inthe Hall of the Dead( Walhalla) at Wewelsburg Castle, Westphalia, in XVII/1982 CE.16. I am the Empress & the Hierophant. Thus eleven as my bride is eleven.“The Empress” (trump #3) and “The Hierophant” (trump #5) again equal“Adjustment” (trump #8). TheÆon of Horus is characterized by the eleven-letter formula “Abrahadabra” [see#I-20].- 84 -17. Hear me, ye people of sighing!The sorrows of pain and regretAre left to the dead and the dying,The folk that not know me as yet.18. They are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor andsad: the lords of theearth are our kinsfolk.19. Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us.They shall rejoice, our chosen, who sorroweth is not of us.20. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, for and fire,are of us.The Law of Thelema is for those with the wit and the will to comprehend andapply it. Others are fated toslow, inevitable regression to beasthood. [Cf. H.G. Wells’ Island of Dr.Moreau.] As for intellectuals andmagicians of the obsolete æon:“Such a being is gradually disintegrated from lack of nourishment and the slowbut certain attractionof the rest of the universe, despite his now desperate efforts to insulate andprotect himself, and toaggrandize himself by predatory practices. He may indeed prosper for awhile, butin the end he must perish,especially when with a new æon a new Word is proclaimed which he cannot and willnot hear, so that he ishandicapped by trying to use an obsolete method of Magick, like a man with aboomerang in a battle whereeveryone else has a rifle.” - Magick in Theory and Practice21. We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in theirmisery. For they feelnot. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched & the weak: thisis the law ofthe strong: this is our law and the joy of the world. Think not, o king, uponthat lie: ThatThou Must Die; verily thou shalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: Ifthe body of theking dissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! TheSun, Strength & Sight, Light: these are for the servants of the Star & theSnake.The “law of the jungle”, raised to its most complex expression in the writingsof Nietzsche. One of theprerogatives of an independent intellect, however, is that of defying the law ofthe jungle - to enable the weakor injured to survive in order that they may prove their worth under othercircumstances. Excessive devotionto one extreme means cruelty. Excessive devotion to the other results inweakening the self through thehosting of parasites. An Aristotelian “Golden Mean” must be sought.In Egyptian philosophy the pharaoh was not a king in the European sense. Ratherhe was an embodiedmanifestation of the neteru. Human shells for him to inhabit might be required,but the “actual” pharaoh wasimmortal.The Star is the Silver Star (A.'.A.'.) of Babalon, and the Snake is subsequently(#II-22) identified asHarWer.22. I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stirthe hearts ofmen with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I willtell myprophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, thisfolly against self.The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things ofsense andrapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.Here the random volatility of the HarWer- neter is shown at its most extreme. Itmay well be one of thegreater tragedies of the Æon of Horus that Crowley did not recognize the fourthsentence of this verse asbeing an abrupt rejection of the disordered thoughts of the first three. Thisrejection is emphasized by thefifth and sixth sentences, which encourage him to strengthen, not impair hissensory powers.23. I am alone: there is no God where I am.The conceptual separation of HarWer from Nuit is absolute; the two neteru aremutually exclusive.24. Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who behermits. Now thinknot to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple,caressed bymagnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes,and massesof flaming hair about them: there shall ye find them. Ye shall see them at rule,atvictorious armies, at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a milliontimes greater thanthis. Beware lest any force another, King against King! Love one another withburninghearts; on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day ofyour wrath.- 85 -Strengthening of self-awareness is not to be achieved through isolation andmeditation, as in the Hinduand Buddhist systems, but through exposure and expression of the self. Thosewith the most highly-developed sense of self-awareness are also those who are seen to attain successin their endeavors; it is a signthat they have correctly identified and actualized their true will. Such aperson will continue to achievesuccess, unless he should clash with another whose true will is equallywell-developed - or more so.25. Ye are against the people, O my chosen!A reaffirmation of #II-18/19.26. I am the Secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy.If I lift up myhead, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down my head, and shoot forth venom,then is raptureof the earth, and I and the earth are one.A learned discourse on the pleasures of sex.27. There is a great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shallmake a greatmiss. He shall fall down into the Pit called Because, and there he shall perishwith the dogsof reason.28. Now a curse upon Because and his kin!29. May Because be accursed forever!30. If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & doesnaught.31. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness.32. Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all theirwords are skew-wise.33. Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!Neither the Book of the Law nor other texts dealing with metaphysics can becomprehended throughpurely-logical analysis. This is the ultimate message of the Platonic Dialogues,which collectivelydemonstrate the futility of a logical approach to the Forms/ neteru. After allrational and scientificprocedures have been exhausted, an intuitive (nœtic) apprehension of each Formis required.A reading of the Book of the Law with an inaccurate or insufficient appreciationof the neteru manifestwithin it can lead to disaster. [Consider Crowley’s own misreading of #II- 22.]34. But ye, o my people, rise up & awake!35. Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy & beauty.36. There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.37. A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride.August 12, the day in 1903 when Crowley married his first wife, Rose EdithKelly. In his Comment heobserved that this event ultimately made possible the Cairo Working [yieldingthe Book of the Law].38. A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.April 8, 9, and 10 beginning at noon.39. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet - secret, O Prophet!40. A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.Crowley identified the “Supreme Ritual” as the March 20 invocation to Horuswhich resulted in thesubsequent success of the Cairo Working. See “The Temple of Solomon the King” inEquinox #I-7.41. A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feastfor death!- 86 -42. A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!43. A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight!44. Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is the dissolution,and eternal ecstasyin the kisses of Nu.A reaffirmation of the true nature of Nuit. Concerning the “dissolution” see thecomments to #I-32 and#II-21.45. There is death for the dogs.Those who reject such dissolution and absorption, and who are not initiatescapable of sustaining theexistence of the ba and ka after the transfer of the khu, will in fact die.46. Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?47. Where I am these are not.48. Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not: Ihate the consoled &the consoler.49. I am unique and conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be theydamned & dead!Amen. [This is of the 4; there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as ababe in an egg.]A restatement of the themes in #II-18/21. Amon is the “conqueror” - the warriorlord of Thebes [see#I-5]. He was the patron of Uast, the IV (4th) Nome of Upper Egypt. Patron ofthe V (5th) Nome wasAmsu, portrayed as one of the children of Horus the Younger [hence “babe in anegg”].50. Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in myeyes; & my spanglesare purple & green.See #I-60. Yet there is also an aspect of HarWer that is closer to Set [whosecolor is red] than to Nuit[whose colors are blue & gold]. Purple is the color of a Magus, and green theblending of the colors of Nuit.51. Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight.The “vision” of a Magus extends beyond the scope of the normal range ofeyesight, just as ultraviolet isbeyond violet in the visible spectrum.52. There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; itis the veil ofsorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre ofthe centuries:veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, &I will rewardyou here and hereafter.The “lying spectre of the centuries” is Osiris, the death- god of the æonpreceding that of Horus. The“vices” of emotional excess are characteristic of emotional use of the intellect- an attribute of HarWer’sdistinction from the dispassionate OU.53. Fear not, o prophet, when these words are said, thou shalt not be sorry.Thou artemphatically my chosen; and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt look upon withgladness.But I will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: they that see thee shall fear thou artfallen: but I liftthee up.A restatement of Crowley’s role as set forth in #I-15. The Curse of a Magus isthat, because he Utters anew Word amidst the values and norms of the expiring æon, or as an unfamiliarcomplement to thepresent æon, few if any will initially understand or endorse that new Word.Hence he can expect to begreeted with disinterest or even contempt. Truth, however, is not determined byvote. HarWer suggeststhat Crowley’s reception will be so antipathetic that even his disciples maylose confidence in him. This,however, will not affect the essential truth of his Word.- 87 -54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail;thou shall revealit: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: They are not of me. The stopsas thou wilt;the letters? change them not in style or value!The Word and philosophy of Aleister Crowley cannot be understood as a mereproduct or synthesisof existing philosophy. A Word [as the Utterance of a Magus] introduces a newphilosophical principlealtogether. While it may contain elements of preexisting wisdom, its essence andemphasis will be unique andaccessible only via nœtic intuition.Crowley is permitted to punctuate the Book of the Law as he thinks appropriate,but he is not to tamperwith the words, letters, or numbers of the text.55. Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English alphabet; thou shalt findnew symbols toattribute them unto.A straightforward instruction for Crowley to discard the number & letter valuesof the Hebrew Cabala. Heignored #II- 55, due no doubt to the years he had already invested in Cabalism,and put forward LiberTrigrammaton as a gesture of compliance. He admitted his dissatisfaction withthis in his 1920 Comment,theorizing further research into Sanskrit or Enochian.The actual solution was deceptively simple: a direct, numerical equivalence tothe order of the Englishalphabet and the construction of a new symbol for each letter/number. #II- 55was later to prove crucial tothe revealing of #II-76 in the Book of Coming Forth by Night.56. Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh notlong: then whenye are sad know that I have forsaken you.Those who ridicule the Book of the Law, feeling secure in the conventions andnorms of the expiring Æonof Osiris, will find that this conservatism works against them when the inertiaof Nuit gradually aligns itself tothe emerging values of the Æon of Horus.Crowley himself was of the opinion [in the 1920 Comment] that this verse alsohad a specialmeaning with regard to impostors and false cults abusing the license of the Æonof Horus: that ultimatelythey would merely make themselves look foolish. There is a lesson here for anyindividual or groupattempting to “go through the motions” of ritual magic, Thelemic or otherwise,without actuallyunderstanding the principles or desiring the results the ceremonies in questionwere originally conceived toactivate. Ritual without such understanding and purpose becomes merely a roteexercise, hence an excuse tonot think!True to the OU-unifying principle of Nuit, Crowley went on to proposeintellectual separateness [from Nuit… ironically the central feature of HarWer, whose æon he was inaugurating] asthe ultimate “evil”. In LiberAleph he observed:“And of such the Lords are the Black Brothers, who seek by their Sorceries toconfirm themselves inDivision … know this concerning the Black Brothers that cry: I am I. This isFalsity and Delusion, for theLaw endureth not Exception. So then these Brethren are not Apart, as they Think;but are peculiarCombinations of Nature in Her Variety.”Alas for those who think that mere insistence upon a law can make its violationimpossible! Quite thecontrary: Were it not conceivable or possible to do so, no law would benecessary in the first place. Nor isit sufficient to say that “[objective] universal law is a fact, not aconvention, hence cannot be violated”.Until man understands and correlates all of what he so boldly calls “naturallaw”, how can he be certain that noexception exists to the tiny province he has thus far mapped?Why should Crowley so dislike the “Black Brethren”, then? Is it just becausethey are explorers bolderthan he, or is it rather because the endless evolution, change, and variety theycherish is antithetical to the goal ofa monolithic, homogenous OU - that siren’s song of Nuit which so enraptured the“Buddhist” Magus of theÆon of Horus?Unfortunately - or fortunately, depending upon your æonic point of view - theBeast 666 had a bit of BlackBrotherhood in his modus operandi as well. He may have advocated the theoreticalideal of universalharmony, but he nonetheless devoted considerable time and effort to exercisingand maximizing his ownindividuality. [I am certain HarWer approved.]57. He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall befilthy still.In the 1920 Comment Crowley viewed this as a corollary to#II-56, suggesting that it is actually impossible for an object to undergochange, because it cannot bealtered in its basic chemical constitution. If an apparent change occurs due tothe addition, subtraction, orrearrangement of elements of this constitution, then the object has lost itsoriginal identity and assumed anew one.- 88 -This argument does not provide, however, for unrealized potential, which may notbe apparent in theoriginal assessment of an object although it is in fact there. A caterpillardoes not lose its identity because itevolves into a butterfly, any more than a man loses his identity because hegrows a beard. For Crowley’sargument to hold true, identity would have to be defined in a strictly limitedsense, and at a fixed point intime. Either one of these assignments would be arbitrary, hence artificial - astepsister’s foot beingjammed into Cinderella’s glass slipper.58. Yea! deem not of change: ye shall be as ye are, & not other. Therefore thekings of theearth shall be Kings forever: the slaves shall serve. There is none that shallbe cast down orlifted up: all is ever as it was. Yet there are masked ones my servants: it maybe that yonderbeggar is a King. A King may choose his garment as he will: there is no certaintest: but abeggar cannot hide his poverty.The Æon of Horus [and the Æon of Set, for that matter] will not enable silkpurses to be made fromsows’ ears. Yet superficial appearances may be quite deceptive, and an Adeptseen through the eyes of a non-Adept may seem to be behaving erratically or irrationally. It is true that abeggar might not be able to hide hispoverty, but a king in a good disguise would seem every bit as impoverished. Injudging another, one mustfirst determine one’s actual ability to render such a judgment, then thejudgment criteria.59. Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King concealed! Say you so?Fool! If he be aKing, thou canst not hurt him.See the discussion of “love” in the comment to #I-57. In his 1920 Comment withreference to #II-59,Crowley further characterized it as a “right relationship” between twocomponents of the Nuit-totality -not a blind attraction for superficial motives which, upon closer examination,might not prove to be mutuallybeneficial.60. Therefore strike hard & low, and to hell with them, master!Crowley is to be aggressive, uncompromising, and remorseless in hisproclamation, definition, andapplication of the Word of the Æon. [He was.]61. There is a light before thine eyes, o prophet, a light undesired, mostdesirable.62. I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thybody.63. Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; theexpiration is sweeterthan death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress of Hell’s own worm.64. Oh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee: hail!hail: prophet ofNu! prophet of Had! prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu! Now rejoice! now come in oursplendour &rapture! Come in our passionate peace, & write sweet words for the Kings!65. I am the Master: thou art the Holy Chosen One.Crowley’s ecstatic experience of the transcription of the Book of the Law, and areaffirmation of hisidentity as Magus of the Æon of Horus.66. Write, & find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! Thrill withthe joy of life &death! Ah! thy death shall be lovely: whoso seeth it shall be glad. Thy deathshall be the sealof the promise of our agelong love. Come! lift up thine heart & rejoice! We areone; we arenone.This is certainly the most tragic and poignant passage in the Book of the Lawbecause of its propheticirony. Crowley died frustrated and confused, tears in his eyes as he fought thecoming of his final coma. [Cf.John Symonds, The Great Beast.] The “red gleam in his eyes”, I suspect, resistedthe dissolution of hispersonality into Nuit.His death was indeed testimony to the promise of the “love” of Nuit [see#I-29/32]. By becoming one,he and Nuit ceased to exist as entities who could be contrasted to one another.save in others’ eyes.Consider also the paradox of the “magical death” of the self when becoming aMagister Templi (8)=[3]A.'.A.'.. See “One Star in Sight” in Magick in Theory and Practice, and also the“Cry of the ThirteenthÆthyr” in Liber 418 ( The Vision and The Voice).- 89 -67. Hold! Hold! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the excellentkisses!68. Harder! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep - die!69. Ah! Ah! What do I feel? Is the word exhausted?Crowley’s ecstatic vision recommences and is likened to a sexual experience.70. There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canstthou bear morejoy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight andninety rules ofart: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there besubtlety therein!This verse addresses an important aspect of Crowley’s philosophy - thatpertaining to indulgence insex and other sensual pleasures of the human body. Critics have accused Crowleyof being a pervert, alecher, and a disgusting sexual psychotic. Many admirers, on the other hand,have tried to imitate hislifestyle on a purely behavioral level - and have succeeded in earning preciselythose titles.Both groups fail to appreciate the artistry, the magical philosophy, and thesensitivity that wereessential components of Crowley’s sensuality. Thus there is an almost surprisingatmosphere of innocencein even the most “lurid” of Crowley’s erotica that is conspicuously lacking inthe crude, genital/anal-obsessed antics of certain latter-day “Thelemites”. Yet another illustration ofthe point made in the commentto #II-56: that ritual without understanding is at least futile, and more oftendangerous, degrading, and/orridiculous.At the other extreme are the compulsively cerebral schools of modern Thelemitethought. Such devoteesare enthusiastic about Crowley the metaphysician, but quite uncomfortable aboutCrowley the sensualist.So they practice a quaintly “proper” version of his Magick: When the text of hisGnostic Mass calls for thepriest to part the veil of the priestess with his lance, such practitionersdutifully brush aside a veil with aceremonial spear!71. But exceed! exceed!Again this verse captures an extremely significant aspect of Crowley’sphilosophy. As he observes in letter#33 of Magick Without Tears, the Aristotelian Golden Mean “is more valuable asthe extremes which itsummarizes are distant from each other”. The depth of this statement cannot beoveremphasized; in fact adeliberate exploration of extremes became the Formula of the Age of Satan,according to the WordIndulgence.A procedure for ascertaining viable extremes from which to define a Golden Meanis too often neglected bystudents of Aristotle. The difficulty in arriving at any sort of “absolute” meanis more understandable whenAristotle’s motives are appreciated: He was trying to construct an alternativeto his teacher Plato’scontention that absolute standards are not definable through purely logicalmethods. [Aristotle failed,returning to Plato’s perspective.]72. Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine - and doubt it not, an ifthou art everjoyous! - death is the crown of all.The OU order of Nuit and the non-natural, emotional will of HarWer - “death” and“life” in the rawestmetaphysical sense - are the ultimate extremes. [The position of Set is notinaccurately approximated as aGolden Mean between these ordered and chaotic extremes; another of the magicalsecrets of the absolutestandard of beauty symbolized by the phi-ratio of the Pentagram of Set.]73. Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man,unto thee.74. The length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. He that liveslong & desires deathmuch is ever the King among the Kings.The Curse of a Magus, as discussed with reference to #II- 53, necessarilysubjects him to strong forces offrustration and depression. The new Word may imply values that are so alien tothose of existing society thatthe Magus doubts his sanity and sense of proportion. All he has to combat thesefactors is a fundamentalconviction that the Word he Utters is true.Can those who are not Magi ever understand the intensity of such a realization?Yes - those who areMasters of the Temple and thus have attained the power of Understanding.75. Aye! listen to the numbers & the words:- 90 -76. 4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L. What meaneththis, o prophet?Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: heshallexpound it. But remember, o chosen one, to be me; to follow the love of Nu inthe star-litheaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word.In his 1920 Comment Crowley observed: “This passage following appears to be aQabalistic test (on theregular pattern) of any person who may claim to be the Magical Heir of TheBeast. Be ye well assured all thatthe solution, when it is found, will be unquestionable. It will be marked by themost sublime simplicity, andcarry immediate conviction.”Revelation 13:11.77. O be thou proud and mighty among men!78. Lift up thyself! for there is not like unto thee among men or among Gods!Lift up thyself, omy prophet, thy stature shall surpass the stars. They shall worship thy name,foursquare,mystic, wonderful, the number of the man; and the name of thy house 418.Revelation 13:12.79. The end of the hiding of Hadit; and blessing & worship to the prophet of thelovely Star!I John 4:3.- 91 -The Third Chapter1.Abrahadabra! the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.Ra-Harakte was a form of HarWer as an aspect of Ra by the priesthood of Ra atHeliopolis. [Cf. Budge,From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt (London: Oxford, 1934, page #216).]Crowley, whose familiarity with Egyptian philosophy was limited to the Osirianmythos, did not knowthat the cosmological systems of the Great Horus and Ra were originallyindependent of the Osirianmovement and were only assimilated into it in corrupt forms during the finaldynastic decadence. HenceCrowley remained confused as to the name and significance of “Ra Hoor Khu[i][t]”and the Third Chapter ofthe Book of the Law - and confessed as much in his 1920 Comment entry concerningthis verse.2.There is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. Spelling isdefunct; all is notaught. Beware! Hold! Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.Again Crowley missed the point of this verse - a simple admonition to correctthe name of Ra-Harakte asindicated on the Stele of Revealing.3.Now let it first be understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shalldeal hardly withthem.4.Choose ye an island!5.Fortify it!6.Dung it about with enginery of war!7.I will give you a war-engine.8.With it ye shall smite the peoples and none shall stand before you.Historically the two most significant events of the Æon of Horus were World WarII and the developmentof the atomic bomb which ended that war. Nor can England’s critical importanceduring the Battle of Britainbe denied.9.Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the Law of the Battle of Conquest: thus shallmyworship be about my secret house.Were the values of the Æon of Horus reflected more by the Allies or more by theAxis? The latterchampioned elitism and “right by might”, whereas the former at leastpropagandistically upheld thebanner of egalitarianism, socialism, and democracy. Yet the police-stateenvironments of Germany, Italy, andJapan also acted to stifle creativity on an individual basis, encouraging andrewarding conformity andautomatic obedience to the very few who, through circumstances as much as geniusor talent, hademerged in positions of power. While the defeat of the Axis might seem to havebeen a defeat for the values ofthe Æon of Horus, then, it may well be that, in a more subtle and long-termsense, the cause of elitism wasbetter served by the victory of more openly-competitive political systems. It isstill too early to venture afinal evaluation in this regard.10. Get the stele of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple - and thattemple is already arightdisposed - & it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shall not fade, but miraculouscolour shallcome back to it day after day. Close it in locked glass for a proof to theworld.11. This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. Iwillmake easy for you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the VictoriousCity. Thoushalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thoushalt havedanger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire & blood;worship mewith swords & with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword before me: letblood flow tomy name. Trample down the Heathen: be upon them, o warrior, I will give you oftheir fleshto eat!Kiblah: a point towards which prayer or devotions of a spiritual nature aredirected.- 92 -Crowley evidently thought better of burglarizing the Boulak Museum to steal thestele. He settled forhaving a replica prepared for him. [The antiquities of the Boulak Museum havesince been transferred to theCairo Museum.]Cairo ( Al-Kahira) = [the city of] victory.12. Sacrifice cattle, little and big: after a child.13. But not now.14. Ye shall see that hour, o blessed Beast, and thou the Scarlet Concubine ofhis desire!15. Ye shall be sad thereof.Crowley later identified these verses as a reference to the death of hisfirstborn daughter in 1906.16. Deem not too eagerly to catch the promises; fear not to undergo the curses.Ye, even ye,know not this meaning all.17. Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Moneyfear not, norlaughter of the folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth orunder theearth. Nu is your refuge as Hadit your light; and I am the strength, force,vigour, of yourarms.18. Mercy let be off: damn them who pity. Kill and torture; spare not; be uponthem.19. That stele they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well itsname, & it shall be toyou as 718.After many failures, Crowley set down “stele” in Greek, which “to him” was 52.He then subtracted 52from 718 and got 666.20. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again.In his 1912 Comment Crowley indicated that he had mentally questioned #III-19.Ra-Harakte chideshim for seeking a justification [see #II-27/33].21. Set up my image in the East: thou shalt buy thee an image which I will showthee,especial, not unlike the one thou knowest. And it shall be suddenly easy forthee to do this.Ra-Harakte (“Ra Hor of the Horizon”) was the aspect of the Sun at dawn, when ofcourse it appears inthe east.22. The other images group around me to support me: let all be worshipped, forthey shall clusterto exalt me. I am the visible object of worship; the others are secret; for theBeast & hisBride are they: and for the winners of the Ordeal X. What is this? Thou shaltknow.Crowley thought “the other images” to be those of Nuit and “Hadit”. In view of#III-21 it would seemmore probable for them to be Ra’s other aspects: Aten (noon), Atum (sunset), andXepera (the Sun at night).Nevertheless [in Liber Resh vel Helios] Crowley did institute periodic devotionsto these other aspects of Ra.The significance of Xepera would indeed remain a secret until the year X of theÆon of Set, at whichtime it would indeed be revealed to the “winners” of that particular ordeal.23. For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine: then oil ofAbramelin andolive oil, and afterwards soften & smooth down with rich fresh blood.Oil of Abramelin [from The Sacred Magic of Abra=Melin the Mage]: Eight parts ofoil of cinnamon, four ofoil of myrrh, two of oil of galangal, seven of olive oil.24. The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, ordropping fromthe host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers:last of somebeast, no matter what.- 93 -25. This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me. This hath also another use; letit be laid beforeme, and kept thick with perfume of your orison: it shall become full of beetlesas it were andcreeping things sacred to me.26. These slay, naming your enemies; & they shall fall before you.27. Also these shall breed lust & power of lust in you at the eating thereof.28. Also ye shall be strong in war.29. Moreover, be they long kept, it is better; for they swell with my force. Allbefore me.30. My altar is of open brass work: burn thereon in silver or gold!31. There cometh a rich man from the West who shall pour his gold upon thee.While Crowley did not specify anyone in particular as the object of this verse,in his later life he receivedcrucial help from one American disciple in particular: Karl Germer, who becameOuter Head (chiefinternational executive) of the O.T.O. following Crowley’s death.32. From gold forge steel.33. Be ready to fly or to smite.34. But your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: though withfire andsword it be burnt down & shattered, yet an invisible house there standeth, andshall standuntil the fall of the Great Equinox; when Hrumachis shall arise and thedouble-wanded oneassume my throne and place. Another prophet shall arise, and bring fresh feverfrom theskies; another woman shall awake the lust & worship of the Snake; another soulof god andbeast shall mingle in the globèd priest; another sacrifice shall stain the tomb;another kingshall reign; and blessing no longer be poured to the Hawk-headed mystical Lord!Crowley felt the “holy place” to be Boleskine House, his former estate by LochNess in Scotland.Boleskine has remained standing to date, but has become a celebrity focal pointfor Crowleyphiles. If thephysical Boleskine is thus reduced to a “haunted house” spectacle, the mysticalBoleskine remains anuntouched image in the minds of those initiates who understand and appreciateits unique role in thedevelopment of its Beastly “Laird”.Harmakhis was one of the many forms of Xepera as a symbol of regeneration,transformation, andimmortality. Harmakhis was portrayed in many shapes, the most famous being thatof the Great Sphinx atGiza.The “double-wanded one” is Set, whose symbols in ancient Egypt were the D’m( Tcham) and w3ssceptres. Both sceptres were Set-headed, but the w3s was distinguished by aspiral shaft and the absence of adecorative base (Set’s forked tail on the D’m sceptre). On the Stele ofRevealing, Ra Harakte holds a D’msceptre. The Setian sceptres signified magical power, as opposed to the crook &flail sceptres symbolizingthe pharaoh’s roles as shepherd and taskmaster of the Egyptian nation.“Fresh fever from the skies”: the Book of Coming Forth by Night.“Another woman”: Lilith Aquino, the Serpent One: Maga V° Temple of Set and Oneof the Nine.“The globèd priest” and “another sacrifice”: Anton Szandor LaVey [who shaved hishead to signify hisoffice as High Priest of the Church of Satan], and the destruction of the Churchof Satan as precondition forthe manifestation of the Æon of Set.“Another king”: Ra-en-Set suten net.35. The half of the word of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.The first half of “Heru-ra-ha” reveals the name of Her-Ur (HarWer), the GreatHorus, of whom bothHarpokrates (the Osirian Horus “the Younger”) and Ra-Harakte [see #III-1] arecorruptions.36. Then said the prophet unto the God:- 94 -37. I adore thee in the song -I am the Lord of Thebes, and IThe inspired forth-speaker of Mentu;For me unveils the veiled sky,The self-slain Ankh-af-na-khonsuWhose words are truth, I invoke, I greetThy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit!Unity uttermost showed!I adore the might of Thy breath,Supreme and terrible God,Who makest the gods and deathTo tremble before Thee: -I, I adore thee!Appear on the throne of Ra!Open the ways of the Khu!Lighten the ways of the Ka!The ways of the Khabs run throughTo stir me or still me!Aum! let it fill me!The sacred bull Mentu was the patron neter of the city of Ani, capital of the IVUast (Thebes) Nome ofUpper Egypt [see #II-49]. Ankh-f-n-Khonsu is the priest on by the Stele ofRevealing. His name means: “[Hewhose] Life [is] in Khonsu (the Moon-neter of Thebes and son of Amon and Mut)”.Crowley saw himself areincarnation of this priest.38. So that thy light is in me & its red flame is as a sword in my hand to pushthy order. There isa secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters (theseare theadorations, as thou hast written), as it is said,The light is mine; its rays consumeMe: I have made a secret doorInto the House of Ra and Tum,Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.I am thy Theban, O Mentu,The prophet Ankh-af-na-Khonsu!By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;By wise T’a-Nech I weave my spell.Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!Bid me within thine House to dwell,"},{"pageContent":"O wingèd snake of light, Hadit!Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit.#III-37 and #III-38 contain extracts of poems Crowley had written prior to theCairo Working [of theBook of the Law]. These poems (titled paraphrases of the inscriptions on thefront and back of the Stele ofRevealing) are contained in the 1936 edition of Crowley’s Equinox of the Gods.[Therein the final line of theextract in #III-37 reads: “Aum! let it kill me!”]39. All this and a book to say how thou didst come hither and a reproduction ofthis ink andpaper for ever - for in it is the word secret & not only in the English - andthy comment uponthis the Book of the Law shall be printed beautifully in red ink and black uponbeautifulpaper made by hand; and to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but todineor drink at them, it is the Law to give. Then they shall chance to abide in thisbliss or no; itis no odds. Do this quickly!The secrets of the Book of the Law are to be found through both the English andthe Egyptian hieroglyphiclanguages.40. But the work of the comment? That is easy; and Hadit burning in thy heartshall make swiftand secure thy pen.In both his 1912 and 1920 Comments Crowley indicated dissatisfaction with theresults of hiscommentaries. He might have fared better had he reconsidered #II-55, though someof the contents of theBook of the Law would remain enigmatic until the advent of the Æon of Set.- 95 -41. Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house; all must be done well and withbusiness way.42. The ordeals thou shalt oversee thyself, save only the blind ones. Refusenone, but thou shaltknow & destroy the traitors. I am Ra-Hoor-Khuit; and I am powerful to protect myservant.Success is thy proof: argue not; convert not; talk not overmuch. Them that seekto entrapthee, to overthrow thee, them attack without pity or quarter & destroy themutterly. Swift asa trodden serpent turn and strike! Be thou yet deadlier than he! Drag down theirsouls toawful torment: laugh at their fear: spit upon them!See #I-32/38. Many who thought to exploit Crowley got the worst of theencounter, and he shed few tearsover them. In fact his contempt to those whom he had discarded is at leastpartly responsible for the often-vicious criticism he received - and continues to receive - at their hands.43. Let the Scarlet Woman beware! If pity and compassion and tenderness visither heart; ifshe leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses then shall my vengeance be known.I will slayme her child: I will alienate her heart: I will cast her out from men; as ashrinking anddespised harlot she shall crawl through dusk wet streets, and die cold andan-hungered.The fate of Crowley’s Scarlet Women was not a pleasant one. After Rose Crowley’sdaughter died, shebecame an alcoholic and was eventually committed to a sanitarium. Crowley’sdaughter by Leah Hirsig, themost famous Scarlet Woman, died at the Abbey of Thelema as an infant, and theshock caused Leah tomiscarry a second child. Eventually she too was abandoned by Crowley under thebitterest ofcircumstances.44. But let her raise herself in pride. Let her follow me in my way. Let he workthe work ofwickedness. Let her kill her heart. Let her be loud and adulterous; let her becoveredwith jewels, and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men!45. Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: then will I breed from her achild mightier thanall the kings of the earth. I will fill her with joy: with my force shall shesee & strike at theworship of Nu; she shall achieve Hadit.None of the Scarlet Women was able to sustain #III-44 and thus attain #III-45.46. I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, & areabased. I willbring you to victory & joy: I will be at your arms in battle & ye shall delightto slay. Successis your proof; courage is your armour; go on, go on, in my strength & ye shallturn notback for any.This is popularly [by Crowleyphiles] considered to be a validation of the Bookof the Law’s propheticpower [as a prediction of World War II] and a further prediction of war in the1980s. Since there are localor regional wars ongoing constantly on some part of the planet, whether or notthe “eighties” predictionis considered to be validated is simply a question of how extensive a war mustbe for Ra-Harakte to takenote of it. Alternately the 1980s were in fact a decade of internationalparanoia concerning and socialpersecution of occultism generally.47. This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the originalin the writingof the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to oneanother: inthese are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but onecometh afterhim, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this linedrawn is a key;then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shallbe his child &that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall fromit.See #I-54, #II-75/76, #III-22, and the Book of Coming Forth by Night.Although #I-56, #II-76, and #III-47 explicitly state that Crowley himself wouldnever know themysteries of the manuscript, the one who would expound them, or the initiatorysystem from which he wouldcome, Crowley nonetheless took it upon himself to recognize Charles StansfeldJones of Vancouver as the“one”. Jones could not interpret the #II-76 passage, but he did announce that“AL/LA” constituted the“master key” to the Book of the Law. Since Crowley was already well aware of thereversible qualities of thisterm in the Hebrew tongue [see comment to #II-15], his enthusiasm for Jones’announcement seemsunjustified - nor did Jones’ “master key” unlock anything at all concerning theBook of the Law.What neither Crowley nor Jones realized was that “AL” in Hebrew is merely acorruption of an elderEgyptian hieroglyphic term which may be pronounced in three ways: “Al”, “Ar”, or“Har”. This term- 96 -translates to “divine son” and specifically identifies Har or Hor, the GreatHorus. [-ur or Wer is a suffixmeaning “great”.] In Egyptian mythology both Set and Horus (HarWer) wereidentified as children ofNuit, but the actual derivation of the two neteru from Nuit is explained moreprecisely in the Book ofComing Forth by Night. So, ironically enough, “AL” is a sort of master key tothe Book of the Law,identifying it as a creation of Horus. A full translation of its name ( Liber ALvel Legis) would be: The Book ofthe Law of Horus.As for Jones, he suffered the fate predicted in #II-56. In 1926-27 he convertedbriefly to Catholicism,then disavowed the Book of the Law and proceeded to announce the new æon to bethat of Maat. Crowleyexpelled him from the A.'.A.'..48. Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I want to go on to the holierplace.49. I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.Crowley felt this “word” to be the four words “Do what thou wilt”, on thepresumption that it would makeeach person his own god.50. Curse them! Curse them! Curse them!51. With my Hawk’s head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross.52. I flap my wings in the face of Mohamed and blind him.53. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongoland Din.54. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.55. Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women beutterly despisedamong you.56. Also for beauty’s sake and love’s.57. Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, butplay: all fools despise.58. But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers!59. As brothers fight ye.60. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.61. There is an end of the word of the God enthroned in Ra’s seat, lighteningthe girders of thesoul.62. To Me do ye reverence; to me come ye through tribulation of ordeal, which isbliss.63. The fool readeth this Book of the Law, and its comment & he understandeth itnot.Moreover the fool readeth this comment & he understandeth it not.64. Let him come through the first ordeal & it will be to him as silver.65. Through the second, gold.66. Through the third, stones of precious water.67. Through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire.The initiatory history of mankind since the destruction of the ancientpriesthoods of Egypt has passedthrough an era of silver (early secret societies and medieval witchcraft), gold(the G.'.D.'. and A.'.A.'.), stones ofprecious water (the Order of the Trapezoid and Church of Satan), and ultimatesparks of the intimate fire(the Temple of Set).- 97 -68. Yet to all it shall seem beautiful. Its enemies who say not so, are mereliars.The Book of the Law exudes an aura of both beauty and authenticity that is notsimply a function of itsincluded statements. It too is a Form which cannot be defined by purely logicalmethods. it must beapprehended through nœsis.69. There is success.And thus is the Book of the Law Understood and Revealed.70. I am the Hawk-headed Lord of Silence & of Strength; my nemyss shrouds thenight-blue sky.71. Hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your time is nighat hand.See the Book of Coming Forth by Night concerning the primal bond of samtauibetween Set and theGreat Horus.72. I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power: the wand of the force of Coph -but my left handis empty, for I have crushed an Universe & nought remains.Again the Crowley manuscript’s value is demonstrated. Crowley originally wrote“Coph”. Rose laterscratched it out and penned “Coph Nia” in its place; this corruption appears inprinted texts. “Coph”, whichCrowley recalled hearing only approximately, would make sense as one of thehieroglyphic variants of Xeper(pronounced “kheffer” with the vowels assumed). Perhaps it is significant thatthe Magus of the Æon ofHorus could not “hear” the Word of the Æon of Set.73. Paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold!Crowley experimented with “chain”-pasting but noticed nothing remarkable. [Iread this as a simpleinstruction to bind the manuscript of the Book of the Law as a book.]74. There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnightis ever the son.The “sun of midnight”: Xepera. The “splendour in my name hidden and glorious”:Set, True Origin ofLiber AL, who would remain hidden until the North Solstice of X.75. The ending of the words is the Word Abrahadabra.The Book of the Law is Writtenand Concealed.Aum.

Murrary to M.A. Aquino17 de June, XDear Magister Aquino, Counselor & Friend;Salut!Before getting to the meat of the matter, let me quote to you a portion of aletter I am currently drafting to Dr.LaVey. I want you to he aware of something that has hit me with megaton force.“... therefore I wish to inform you ofmy intention to withdraw from ‘The Church of Satan, Inc.’ and return to TheChurch of Satan which has been inexistence for many thousands of years.” To quote a recent bandied about quote, “’Nuff said?”!O.K., here we go. The phone has been coming off the hook here since Friday, 13Jun. Of course I was in Elkoover the weekend, but when I returned Sunday morn, dear mother had a note pad ofmany pages with notesregarding who called and why. Sandy, the mailperson is now delivering by thebag. No joke!For some reason I have become in the eyes of many, a sort of Vicar-General ofthe Caldron, or to put it in myown elegant way, a wailing wall for odds and sods from all over the lot. Alas(as the case may be), I am reaping seedsof my own sowing. For the past six years I have; answered every letter, returnedevery phone call, gone out of myway for every bloke who needed a visit, handed out advice and admonishments(when called for) --because, likePopeye the Sailor, “I yam-what-I-yam!” Now, whether I an the recipient manytimes over of that famed CentralGrotto decoration, “The Short End of the Stick” w/Splinter Cluster is anacademic question. Though I must say thatthe letter I received from the group a la nom de plume “John Kincaid” re thenebulous nature of my RegionalAgencyship was a monument of misinformation and downright fucking lies. All ofthis, of course, is stacked up inthe useless lumber pile of the past. Having served its purpose, it is discarded.Warlock Mark Harris and his lovely wife, Janice (Now there is a marriage made inHell!) are currently visitorsto Carpathia. Mother Keller will he up here some time today. It is raining, thehot spell breaking, and for three daysa great black crow or magpie has been circling the block and the house. Goodsigns, I would say.Three turgid paragraphs of preamble to open this letter. Not had, Bill, not hadat all. Oh, well, it could have beenworse. I can imagine your in-basket is overflowing, so is mine. So in some sortof order, mixing phone calls andletters but trying to keep them in sequence to the order of your “informationalpacket” which I hope will he a handyreference for you, and away we go;Bits and Pieces“Bill, if Dr. LaVey needs some money, why couldn't he sell off some of that isthat is listed in that book thatWolfe wrote?”“If it is money, I’ll contribute something.”“And in this case my II° doesn’t mean a fucking thing!”“Who the hell does he think he is, the Pope? Shit, my dad bought all his degreesin the K.C. Is this what theChurch of Satan is now?”“I cried all night!”“I am stronger, because of this, than I have ever been before.”“I think it is a joke.”“Is this what he meant when he talked about whoopie-cushions?”“I’ve been calling Central Grotto all day. All I get is that recording.”“Does Magister Aquino really mean that I can write to him?”“I saw this coming a year ago.”“When my wife and I saw Dr. LaVey at Central the night of the 23rd, we werereally surprised. He seemed sotired. Except for some girl with the name of Hansen, there seemed to be no oneelse there. I felt that he just wantedsome friendly people to talk to -and listen to. He made me feel like he was mylong-lost father. He was so gentle. Itwas all I could do to keep from calling him ‘Tony’. God damn it, he seemed sotired.”“When we got hack to the car, I turned to (husband) and said, ‘Oh, my god, heseemed so alone. I wanted to holdhim in my arms.’”“When we were driving back over the bridge, suddenly we both turned to each andin almost the same voicesaid, ‘Was that Dr. LaVey?’.”“Hey, Bill, is this some sort of backstairs revolution?”“Is it true, can anyone ‘lift the Mandate’?”“Poor Mr. (sic) LaVey, I am so embarrassed for him.” [Note: Seven other peopleexpressed embarrassment. Oneof our Canadian members expressed it with such compassion: “I feel as though avery old and dear friend hadunintentionally farted at the vicarage tea.”]“What do I do now? Join the Hell’s Angels?”“I see the hand of Diane LaVey in all this.” [Now that is an interestingthought.]“Hey, is what happened down in Santa Cruz connected with all of this?”“I saw all this shit coming when West II went down the tubes last year.”- 123 -“Who does he think he is - Richard Nixon?”So far, that is just a brief sample of what has been coming in. I think I cansee a trend starting to develop. Agree?Perhaps I am wrong. It is really too soon to tell.Now this is what I have been doing. In my response to all telephone calls and inmy answers to letters, I havebeen saying this: “Please do not react without chewing this over for a while. Anemotional reaction is not whatanyone needs right now. Besides, when you react emotionally, there is always thepost operation of removing hooffrom mouth! If nothing else, we are realistic and logical [or at least try tobe]. Let’s base our reaction on this littlestory: When modern China opened its doors to western newsmen again, thethen-current editor of the SingaporeStraits Times (who has recently written a book on the Chinese Army; P.L.A. ) wasable to interview Marshal ChuTeh, one of the driving forces that created the P.L.A. One of the questions, inso many words, was ‘How did thecollapse of the Roman Empire in the year 300 effect or affect the East?’.Marshal Chu pondered the question foronly a few seconds and replied, ‘It is too soon to tell.’” I am telling everyoneto stay cool and just wait.For the most part, I think most folks are going to do this, for a number ofreasons; 1. They are scared of gettingin the way of “two of the Biggies slugging it out.”, 2. They will just give upand die on the vine. O.K. I am not tooconcerned about this lot. Perhaps they are the “chaff” you referred to. As weknow, there are resignations starting tocome in: you, Lilith, Dale, Shai, Harris, some others as well. My letter is onthe drafting board.Gumbo Ya Ya - or, What is Happening in “the Network”On the 11th and 12th of July a meeting of all concerned in the Ohio area will beheld at Warlock Huddleston’splace in Mt. Vernon. Warlocks Huddleston and Zabrecky have been in constantcontact with Warlocks Shai,Andrews, and Rev. McQuown. From what I can gather from Art Zabrecky’s last phonecommunication, it looks likequite a mob from the Midwest will be there. I have instructed him and Ratley tomake a full report to you. I havealso indicated to them to immediately write you and tell you themselves theirfeelings regarding this whole matter(favorable to you, by the bye). But I want you to hear it firsthand from them,and not secondhand from me. That iswhy my charge to them. As you know, Warlock Zabrecky has phoned the SantaBarbara “hot line” several times. Heseemed upset that you did not directly answer him. Art can be a hit impatient attimes. I indicated to him the pressof your work and this current situation, and also delivered a short lecture oncommon sense. He saw the point. Youshall be hearing from him and Tom shortly.Shai called for the second time last night when I was conducting the Harris’ onthe 50-cent tour of Carpathia.We had a good chat, and he indicated to me again his original reasons fordropping the III°, and now the final act,his resignation from C of S, Inc. Please tell the lovely Lilith that we alsotalked of “Semper Barley” and happiertimes. My eyes got a little wet around the edges. Must be the dust and “chaff”.Mike is such a good friend.Incidentally va multimisc, dear Priestess Lilith for the copy of your letterwhich came yesterday in the bag. Youspeak for all of us.From our friends in Canada, much of interest. Long telephone call from Stu Munrolast night. Incidentally Stu(“Cheech” to his friends) was most appreciative to receive the entire packetrather than just the letter.To digress for the nonce: Had things continued to run at their usual pace,Priestess Wendall and I would havebeen in contact with you regarding Stuart Munro’s possible appointment to theII°. There is good reason for this.Currently the Eastern Canada Regional Agency is a shambles. I was compiling areport to you on this matter, butjust didn’t have all the facts yet. It really breaks my heart to report that[and this guy I considered a friend at onetime] Stephen Hollander is just not doing the job. He refuses to respond tocontacts from the people in. his agency.This policy of non-contact has been in effect since the final gavel at East VI.Needless to say, our Canadian friendsare up in arms about this. Prior to these events I had received a stack ofcomplaints over the way Hollander [andLynne Jarman] were conducting their meetings, the subject matter covered, andhis general holier-than-fucking-thou attitude. People in the Ottawa-Hull area actually stopped coming tomeetings. Now I wonder who wasboycotting whom.Anyway, Stu indicated to me in a letter of a week or so ago that he was ready tobecome a working member ofthe Church, and was wondering just what he could do. As you know, Stu is theDirector of the Motorcycle SafetyProgram of the Canadian Ministry of Transport. Fact is, he wrote the course.Currently he has been traveling all overthe continent, as not only has Canada accepted the program but the U.S., GreatBritain, France, Switzerland, theNetherlands, Belgium, etc. are very interested. Stu will be in Paris on the20th.Incidentally when he was in Washington, D.C., he “recruited” the executivesecretary of one of the “big wheels”in the Secretary of Transportation’s Office. He felt very frustrated as he hadno one in the D.C. area to refer her to.He said she is a real firecracker and a Compleat Witch. I told him to have hercontact the Central Grotto P.O. Box.What else could I do?I have as yet to hear from Jzamon in Massachusetts, or “Bear” Brownell in NovaScotia. If I know them as Ithink I do, they are listening, pondering, and waiting. Which would be prettydamn good advice for anyone.Back to “Bits and Pieces” for a bit: letters and telephone calls. Four peopleindicated that they felt there were“gaps” in the 17 pages that were sent in “the packet”. This I could not answer.However I do not believe this is thecase. If it is, then O.K., whatever your reasons are, they are yours. I feelthey felt there were gaps as in one case onlyone page of a letter was included. Well, hell, what was of value was on thatpage. There was no reason to reproducethe entire letter.- 124 -To date, 12:30 P.M., 17 June; 12 people feel that this is the culmination of“the great joke” Anton LaVey startedin 1966: “This is the Big Rip-Off, and now he is going to split.”Twenty-five people feel that about two years ago or so, and they are basing thison rereading past issues of theAgents Bulletin and the Hoof. Anton LaVey delegated too much authority to thewrong people in Central Grotto, acorps of “yes-persons” developed, each one out to grab what he or she could, andthings got out of hand.I remember way back one Hallowe’en year VI, after the gate buzzed open and Itrudged up the brick stairs, “theBoss” related in so many words, “This is what I have created. Now it is up toyou - the II°, III°, and other degrees - to‘carry the ball’.” Now get this: “I have other fish to fry.” So help me, Hastur,sir, he said it!I’ve got to say it, otherwise I’ll bust: “Beluga caviar and Stolichnaya vodka” -Bullshit!Five people commented on paragraph 1 of page 1 of your letter dated 2 May. Theywanted to know if the“accountant” you were referring to is an accountant who does the books of theChurch, or an accountant who doesthe personal books of Dr. LaVey and his family. Or are both accounts one and thesame?Everyone so far has commented on the two pages of the proposed Hoof for May/JuneX. They all thought youdid a nice job of easing the pain, however somewhat less than 50% did expresssome verbal eyebrow-lifting at youeven wanting to “go along with the gag”. Sorry, sir, but that is what was said.Hell, some people just do not knowhow to read.All did say you handled as well as could he expected considering what wasa-brewing.The general opinion of the LaVey letter of 27 May is “Pooey on the LaVey letterof 27 May!”. One delightful soulfrom one of our southern states observed, “Well, well, it is certainly a greatstep from Manichewitz(?) and Lox toBeluga and Stolichnaya.”All cheered your letter of 31 May. Nineteen [give or take one or two, can’treally remember, as I did not keepscore on these] did wonder why the telephone was not used during thisinterchange that, of course, led to what hasnow happened.The Diane LaVey letter of 4 June. Almost all agree that this is vitriolic,contradictory, and an immediate,hysterical lashing-back at you in that you did dare to question the papalinfallibility of him. It was bitter, vicious,“witch-bitch cat infighting”, and also showed the true colors of Central Grottoat its worst.Reports as early as last year from the Eastern area indicated to me that therewas some great concern as to thedirection the Church was taking with regard to “this over-ego, power-mad,headlong rush the Church and its leadersseem to he taking.”Let’s stick with this a little longer. Take another look at paragraph 3 on page2 of Diane’s letter. Some of thenow-embarrassing things that occurred during the “early prankish stage” of thedevelopment of the Church are stillcoming home to roost. Because of some of the drivel that was handed to Wolfe,who slavishly included it in “thatbook”, we lost three excellent members here in Winnemucca - two, mind you, beingrather well-placed in the policedepartment. We also lost a good, older husband and wife team in Reno/Sparksbecause of this.Now I know damn well [or think so] that Anton LaVey really did lead Wolfe downthe garden path when all thiswas going on, just as he led the poor chap that did that thing in the recentissue of Argosy.Now, about “those photographs”: When I was speaking to the students of Nye Hall,University of Nevada atReno, the minister of the Campus Methodist Church quietly handed me a page tornfrom a girlie magazine. “How doyou explain this, sir?” I had to satisfy my ego by countering, “Try it, youmight fill your church this Sunday.” I wasnot proud of my answer. And I sure as hell did not mention that particularencounter in my report to Central.Last night Warlock Harris showed me a magazine which was published several yearsago, and will probably he avaluable collector’s piece in the future, showing the High Priest and otherscavorting with all sorts of naked younglovelies. I will say everyone seemed to be enjoying each other’s company. But,and with all reverence to Sir FrancisDashwood, there is a time and a place for everything. And really there are timeswhen a photographer should notbe present. I am no prude, mind you. I like my “meat and potatoes” sex, and Ialso like my “chilled vodka, pepper,cracked crab, and Arab coffee” sex as well. But I shall never make a publicdisplay of it!All wondered at why Diane wrote the letter. Was Dr. LaVey too overcome or tooindifferent to answer? Or makea statement of position? Why Diane? [Why Diane indeed?] That breaks my heart.When I was down there, I was completely bowled over as to how charming and whata wonderful hostess shewas, how she welcomed me to her home as though I were a loved and valued memberof the family. Unfortunately,having just gone through a dreadful emotional experience, I overreacted andbasked in the blaze of the LaVeys like alittle lost puppy who had been brought in out of the rain and in front of thekitchen stove was given a warm dish ofmilk. That was Mistake Number One.“Circus of Dr. LaVey” - that raised a few eyebrows!Holy Toledo, the fence around Central is a fine idea. Ask Mark Harris aboutsecurity measures here atCarpathia. Also ask Margaret Wendall about the eggs, smashed bird feeder,cosmetic smears on sidewalk and wall ofhouse, and, most wretchedly, the mutilated body of a little rabbit that wasthrown on her lawn!“Little place on the Napa/Sonoma County border” - Everyone commented on thatone. The general roar thatwas most heard was, “Not according to Wolfe!”“Just don’t let us know who considers ...” etc. This was greeted with howls oflaughter and snorts of glee. Onewell-knowing gent commented on the phone, doing a rather good impression of Dr.LaVey’s voice, “I am Oz theGreat and Terrible. What do you want, tin man?”- 125 -All of us who know, love, and respect Lilith have no comments to make regardingthe last three paragraphs onpage 1. Other than the remark that her and “Lana” (?) “used to giggle overthis”. Hell, I was led to believe that “LanaGreen” was the nom de plume of who ever was currently secretary. Have I been thevictim of a falsehood? Same dealwith “Kincaid”.Nobody was too excited about the remark that she felt you had on purpose writtenyour letter with the idea that“others see it”. Everybody said, “So what?” Hell, it’s just like me. You canshow this particular letter of mine toanyone you want to. I am not ashamed of anything I have written to anybody.Your letter of 10 June is a monument of tact, diplomacy, and, yes, heartbreak.All agree that you, or any of us,have the power to “lift the Mandate”. You chose to do it.The “general letter” to the membership of the 10th naturally had to follow. Tonot have done so would have beena violation of your “Mandate”.More to follow ... Thus ends Part One of the tender and true-to-life story ofJust Plain Beau, Warlock ofWinnemucca. Brought to you by Garcia’s Guacamole - great for eating and shininggreen shoes.Respectfully,Salutari Satan!William F. MurrayWarlock II°[index-126_1.jpg]- 126 -A9: Paul Kantner & the Jefferson Starship- by Michael A. Aquino VI°____________________________"},{"pageContent":"PART I: RETURN OF THE PANTECHNIKONFirst published: Runes #I-3November XVIII/1983A week or so ago I received a surprise phone call from an NBC reporter in LosAngeles asking me what I knewabout sinister/occult messages being “reverse-mastered” on rock music albums.“Nothing to be gained by it, even ifit is occurring,” I said, “since it would be far more effective to insertmagical messages straightforwardly.” “Do youknow any group that does that?” asked NBC. “Sure,” I said. “The JeffersonStarship’s been doing it for over adecade.” “Yes, we heard that you had some connection with the Starship,” saidNBC. “Anything to that?”Suddenly I had visions of Charles-Manson-and-the-Beatles “exposes”, followed byJerry Falwell picketing theStarship’s Earth-base over on Fulton Street. “Paul Kantner and I correspondedbriefly in ’75-78,” I said, “but thatwas about it. None of the Starship are or were affiliated with the Temple ofSet, and none of them has been involvedwith conventional Black Magic.” NBC sounded disappointed, but gradually perkedup as our discussion led intosome of the other exotic interests of the Temple.In fact the story of the Temple of Set and the Jefferson Starship is a good dealweirder than Charles Manson’sfixation with “Helter Skelter”, and far more Black Magical in the bargain. Aswith so many other things concerningthe Temple, however, it is so complicated that an answer to Mr. NBC would havechurned up his phone bill wellbeyond its already 3-hour bite ...18 years ago in August a new band opened in San Francisco at a small nightclubnamed the Matrix. Calling itselfthe Jefferson Airplane, it soon became the most prominent band of theHaight-Ashbury “acid rock” culture. Thethemes of its songs [and first 6 albums] were those of the late 1960s: love,political protest, and psychedelic fantasia.Flying my loudspeaker-equipped psychological warfare chopper around Vietnam in1969-70, I used to treat U.S.fire-support bases to a sky-blasted (12-horn/12,000 watt) tape of “Volunteers ofAmerica” or “Somebody to Love”before my trademark, Simon & Garfunkel’s “Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine”.In 1970 I returned to San Francisco, was ordained to the Satanic Priesthood, andencountered a very singularnew album which I wrote up in the Nineveh Grotto’s Blacklist newsletter. BearingPaul Kantner’s name and“Jefferson Starship” (rather than “Airplane”), it was called Blows Against theEmpire. Kantner’s compositions,arranged in a loose sequence, told the story of a group of young countercultureAmericans, increasingly alienatedand frustrated by the climate of the Johnson/Nixon era, who ultimately decidedto hijack an orbiting starship justconstructed by the government and go streaking off into the cosmos en route tothe Andromeda Galaxy. At the endof the accompanying libretto booklet was a proclamation:- 127 -We intend to hijack the first sound interstellar or interplanetary starshipbuilt by the people of thisplanet. A time of 3-7 months will be needed for tantronic conversion of themachinery to make it usable forpractical travel - involving light years. We need people on Earth now to beginpreparing the necessary tools.There will be room for 7,000 or more people. If it seems that your head is intothis, please write & talk aboutsomething for a bit. You will not be contacted immediately. Please just prepareyour minds & your bodies.Experiment - move your mind. Practice telepathy & telekinesis - if you feel it.Search out Atlantis. Itlives and breathes inside of you. Join us - a plunge into reality.- Starship FoundationUnfortunately Blows Against the Empire was rather ahead of its time. The fad ofthe day was not spacemigration but the “Jesus Freak” movement. The “Jefferson Starship” went back tobeing the Jefferson Airplane, andfor the next 4 years produced 4 albums - Sunfighter, Bark, Long John Silver, andBaron von Tollbooth & theChrome Nun - characterized by increasing musical expertise and a kaleidoscope ofthemes and images. By nowGrace Slick and Paul Kantner were all that remained of the original 1966 band,but the availability of guest crew forthe Airplane seemed endless.Kantner’s 1971-73 songs appeared to deemphasize space travel in favor of magicaland mystical concepts,ancient Egypt, and weird, futuristic fantasies. In Bark (1971) he had firstfocused on the summer of 1975 as anoccasion of special importance, but seemed reluctant to be specific. As late asMay 30, 1975, when asked what hethought was about to occur, he responded: “I think it is going to be obvious bythe end of the summer where thiscountry is going. I’d be really surprised if it isn’t. Several differentpossibilities, depending upon whether you areoptimistic or pessimistic. Either you are going to have Gerald Ford for another30 years and it will keep gettingprogressively worse, or it will explode in a civil situation, or it’s going toget better. And there is a great chance of itgetting better from any number of natural and supernatural origins.”“I don’t know,” commented Grace Slick. “I’ve asked Paul a number of times whathe means in the lyrics. Hesays, ‘I don’t know - any way you take it.’ I’m sure he means well, but I reallydon’t know what he is talking about. Ithink the political situation all over is so screwed up that nothing is going tocome together, and actually once a weeksomething else falls apart. Then next week something else falls apart, and thenext week something else. It doesn’tseem to go ‘Blam!’ all at once.”In terms of mundane history 1975 proved to be neither more nor less noteworthythan its predecessors andsuccessors. It did prove to be a very significant year for the band itself, asits latest album, Dragonfly, hadmushroomed into an unprecedented hit. Coincidentally it had been released underthe signature of “JeffersonStarship”. The theme which had been ahead of its time in 1970 was now perfectlytimed, aligned, and focused. TheUnited States had just emerged from the Scylla of Vietnam and the Charybdis ofWatergate into energy shortagesand ecological doomsday forecasts. Escapism was pervasive, beginning withrevivals or the old Star Trek televisionseries and culminating a year later in the popular hysteria that greeted GeorgeLucas’ Star Wars.Everyone in the music/literary world had an explanation for the JeffersonStarship’s sudden success. It was thereturn of Marty Balin, or it was the new sophistication of the music, or GraceSlick’s voice was now repaired/perfected. All such analyses blissfully ignored the elegantly simple fact of thename-change. Everyone was nowlonging to escape to space, and here was a genuine space-band to sing us on ourway.Until 1975 the Jefferson Airplane had been significant to me primarily as an“old San Francisco friend”,nostalgically comforting to hear as I roamed about the planet. But the crisisand destruction of the Church of Satan,the Book of Coming Forth by Night, and the creation of the Temple of Set on theSummer Solstice of 1975 suddenlymade Paul Kantner’s predictions very intriguing indeed. I sensed the presence ofa Magical Link. From theirdisconnected beginnings in San Francisco nine years earlier, both the JeffersonAirplane and the Church of Satanhad passed through a “lens” in 1975 and emerged as something totally different.The only one of the original thirtycopies of the Book of Coming Forth by Night not sent to the hierarchy of theSatanic Priesthood, therefore, went toPaul Kantner.As the Temple of Set began to emerge in its newfound identity, Kantner’scuriosity was aroused. “Beware therespectable,” he wired me. “Interested in your explorations of 7 deadly sins.What do you pursue in yourcommunity? I’m coming through soon, perhaps, and care to explore the limits.What can you offer?”“Essentially,” I answered, “the Temple of Set is a machine to facilitate theexchange of information and ideasbetween Setians; it is a means, not an end. The real value of the Temple lies inthe minds of the Setiansthemselves.” But Kantner’s question continued to provoke me. He was in quest of“the limits” - presumably ofhuman consequence. He himself was pursuing this quest through the medium ofmusical expression, and verysuccessfully so. How might a “machine” like the Temple of Set embrace such aquest? The projects and priorities ofthe Temple being what they were, I didn’t have a chance to devote serious timeto the problem for another two years- during which time the Starship launched two more albums, Spitfire and Earth.Since the Winter Solstice of X/1975 the Temple of Set had been researching theconcepts of human evolutionand extraterrestrial migration, the results of which were sent to the Priesthoodin a series of five working papersunder the general title Setamorphosis. Setamorphosis-V crystallized the researchinto a proposal entitled ProjectAtlantis, addressed to both the Priesthood and Paul Kantner:- 128 -The object of Project Atlantis is to execute a three-phase operation designed toprovide a base forsimultaneous transmission to both Earth and outer space. Such transmission is tobe entirely artistic andwithout any military or utilitarian/scientific influences or applicationswhatever. Project Atlantis is to becontrolled by a nonprofit corporation specifically designed for this purpose,with directors designated by theJ.S. and the T.S. but with no other legal or financial ties to eitherorganization or to any other outsideagency or institution ...Phase I’s object is to conduct a single, suborbital transmission from space ca.1982 by means of theNASA Space Shuttle, which is expected to be operational by 1980 and availablefor private experiments on atime-sharing basis shortly thereafter. This package may consist of: (1)Transmission of specially recorded, orretransmission of live music to Earth by the Jefferson Starship. (2)Transmission of the same program toAlpha Centauri and the Andromeda Galaxy in the form of uncoded music ormathematically-encodedimpulses. (3) Transmission of test patterns to evaluate communications linksbetween elements of theTemple of Set First and Second Foundations. (4) Transmission of encoded signalsby the Temple of Set toAlpha Draconis, Sirius, and the Crab Nebula.Phase II, ca. 1985, would be a series of scheduled transmissions of a mixsimilar to that of Phase I,through relay from Earth to an orbiting satellite designed, orbited, andoperated by Project Atlantis itself.Difficulties may be encountered because of many nations’ propaganda andcensorship policies towards anindependent satellite with a trans-world reach. A PSYOP analysis will beconducted accordingly, as willfeedback analysis of its influence.Phase III, programmed for 1990, will consist of enhanced experiments of theorder of Phase II,conducted from a manned space station specifically designed for Project Atlantisand controlled by it,subject only to recognized international space treaties. The station will be asinaccessible as possible to anygovernment, military instrument, or interest group. Its sole orientation will betowards the musical,magical, and recreational principles of Project Atlantis. It is conceived as thestarting-point for experimentsbeyond Project Atlantis itself.Paul Kantner wired back his enthusiasm for the preliminary study, and I began tocorrespond accordingly withcontacts in NASA, RAND, Princeton’s Space Studies Institute, the World FutureSociety, and the Smithsonian. Thepreliminary study, prepared in November 1978, identified some serious problems:The Environmental Fund in Washington, D.C. projects an average annual worldpopulation increaseduring the Project Atlantis time-span of 87.3 million. This figure’ssignificance lies in its effect upon thefreedom of action of U.S. individuals and institutions, including the tighteningof domestic budgets[including NASA]. The Soviet Union will have a temporary military advantage overthe United States from1983 to 1985, during which time the U.S.S.R. is projected to be under seriousalliance and economic strain.In addition to social pressure against the “selfish” use of an orbital spacestation for the recreational/artisticuse of a relative few, we would face significant danger of a military threat,considering that nuclear deliverysystems are targeted by satellite. In view of the estimated $3,000 per 1.5square feet of space on the NASASpace Shuttle, we may contact OTRAG in New York and Stuttgart for its estimates.Preliminary data forPhase III will be initiated through NASA’s LDEF program.Alas, Project Atlantis was doomed. Controversy bordering on outright fear wasdeveloping within the Temple ofSet, many of whose Initiates weren’t certain they were ready for orbit, muchless a trip to M31. If our seasoned BlackMagicians were getting cold feet, one may presume that the Starship crewmemberswere similarly dubious abouttranslating their Captain’s “quaint fantasy” into something very real - and incollaboration with the dark & diabolicalTemple of Set! Moreover the Jefferson Starship had confronted disaster of a moreimmediate kind during a trip toGermany that year. 12,000 fans had rioted and destroyed over $200,000 of theband’s equipment. An exhaustedand unnerved Grace Slick had announced her departure from the group, andcofounder Marty Balin was on thebrink of following suit. The appearance of each new Starship album wasaccompanied by reviews lauding Balin’slove songs and disparaging the “inevitable” Kantner sci-fi pieces.Project Atlantis, it seemed, would have to be postponed until prospects for itssuccess improved - from all inputsources. Then within three months I had retired from the High Priesthood, andthe new High Priest was nervousabout flights even in conventional airliners.While awaiting a more opportune launch-date, I decided to take Paul Kantner andGrace Slick to Andromedaanyway - via The Dark Side. Slick was transformed into a fire-dæmon of Sith anda confederate of Darth Vader’s.[She sang beautiful music in Dreams, and I was sorry I had painted such aterrifying picture of her. Then shereleased Welcome to the Wrecking Ball, and I decided I wasn’t so far off thetrack after all.] I took the liberty ofdestroying Kantner’s body and transferring his mind to a Pantechnikon (an“ultimate cyborg”). These tworemarkable creatures contributed to the outcome of the Star Wars scenario in asequence rather more startling thanthat experienced by audiences of the Lucasfilm movie sequels.It has taken Paul Kantner five years to get the Jefferson Starship’s enginesback to full translite power. GraceSlick is back on board, and this month has seen the release of Kantner’s PlanetEarth Rock & Roll Orchestra, the 13-years-delayed evolutionary successor to Blows Against the Empire. [AppropriatelyPlanet Earth is subtitled The- 129 -Empire Blows Back.] I could tell you something about the plot, but then yourcuriosity wouldn’t drive you to acquirethe album and hear the music (which is the Key to the Link). [Select the record,not the cassette, as only the formerincludes the critical documentary inserts.]The Temple of Set may be returning to its original scope, and the JeffersonStarship may be soaring high again,but Project Atlantis remains dormant. The projections in our initial researchhave materialized only too well. Aconstricting network of barriers to Phases I & II have arisen, while the killersatellite technology of the Soviet Unionand the military capabilities of the Space Shuttle [whose program was saved fromscuttling by Defense Departmentinterest] would make Phase III a highly vulnerable undertaking.Space colonization efforts pioneered by Gerard O’Neill, deliberately designed toappeal to the corporate profitmotive, have yet to yield substantive results. Even so, space efforts by themilitary/industrial complex are a far cryfrom the utopian beauty and vision of Project Atlantis. At the other end of thespectrum are the antics of TimothyLeary et al., whose simplistic space migration fantasies tend to subject anyserious attempt towards non-M/I use ofspace to public ridicule [hence disinterest].Are we then condemned to the placebo of fantasy? Must Paul Kantner contenthimself with singing about spaceto audiences attracted far more to the mind-dulling throb of rock concerts thanto his lyrical concepts andexpressions? Must the bodies of those who are developing Setian consciousnessesremain chained to a biospheregoverned increasingly by what Nietzsche described as “the tyranny of the mostinferior and the most stupid”, evenas their intellects yearn towards the limits of existence? Not necessarily. TheOrder of the Trapezoid will beconcerning itself with research towards Project Atlantis’ successor.

Attempts to explain it - to reduce it tological statement or argument - alwaysfall short of the original and are thus inadequate and disappointing. Setiansare well-acquainted with how difficult itis to explain the atmosphere of a Black Magical ceremony to someone with aconventional, materialisticbackground. This supra-rational quality also characterizes good music, whoseimpact on the senses similarly cannotbe reduced to words:Music and architecture - Is it not in these disciplines that we find recordedthe path of humanity’sascent? When I hear Wagner, it seems to me that I hear rhythms of a bygoneworld. I imagine to myself thatone day science will discover, in the waves set in motion by the Rheingold,secret mutual relationsconnected with the order of the world. The observation of the world perceived bythe senses precedes theknowledge given by exact science as well as by philosophy. It is insofar aspercipient awareness approachestruth that it has value.I can’t help wondering what Adolf Hitler, who uttered those words 42 years ago,would think of Paul Kantnerand the Jefferson Starship [Yes, the picture of such an encounter strains myimagination too, but read on.] - becausemore than any other contemporary musical group, the Starship has managed to turnthe human voice into a musicalinstrument. The individual members of the band do not “sing the words to songswhich they play on instruments”;rather they become the songs - so much so that the words frequently become lostwithin a swelling of sheer musicalpower. “When it works best,” Kantner says of the Starship, “we become a greatchurning air machine, capable ofmoving people to the unknown, of making you cry, laugh, march in silly parades.”All Airplane/Starship albumssince Blows Against the Empire have included printed lyrics, so that dazedaudiences would be able to interpret atleast part of what they had just experienced.Rock music with complicated and sophisticated themes is never going to beterribly popular, since it demandstoo much thinking - and people don’t go to rock concerts to think. Quoth AlvinToffler in his now-classic FutureShock:The religious fervor and bizarre behavior of certain hippie cultists may arisenot merely from drugabuse, but from group experimentation with both sensory deprivation andbombardment. The chanting ofmonotonous mantras, the attempt to focus the individual’s attention on interiorbodily sensation to theexclusion of outside stimuli, are efforts to induce the weird and sometimeshallucinatory effects ofunderstimulation.So the Starship, while successful and indeed legendary, has never quite been oneof those hysterical/smash-hit/teen-craze groups. Its better-known songs have been those with fairly familiarthemes of love, and psychedelia. Ifshe sings a thousand other songs, Grace Slick will always be remembered as thegirl who sang “White Rabbit”.- 130 -And far out in the Twilight Zone of Starship esoterica are the compositions ofPaul Kantner, who sine-wavesbetween visions of mankind’s ancient past and evolutionary future. Not too manylisteners seem to have devotedmuch serious thought to the ideas in Kantner’s lyrics, and this is notsurprising given their complexity. But what issurprising is that his music seems to have become the target of a modern-daywitch-hunt.Last week I was invited to appear on a radio talk-show with Kantner. Also on theshow were one Catholic priestand one fundamentalist pastor from the “Eagle’s Nest Christian Fellowship” inCalifornia’s fabled Orange County.The issue of the evening was - seriously! - whether the Devil is french-fryingthe minds of today’s youth with secretmessages recorded backwards into rock-and-roll music.I thought I had seen it all after The Exorcist movie came out and scores ofpeople around the country beganbeing possessed. But this “reverse-mastering” scam actually seems to be believed- not only by fundamentalistsnake-oil salesmen but by many of their audiences as well.The panel discussion reminded me of nothing so much as the Mad Hatter’s teaparty: Whatever Kantner or Isaid to dispute the accusation was simply ignored by the fundamentalist and hiscallers [who, since so manyaddressed him by his first name, I suspect were exhorted in advance to storm thetelephone lines].It began with the accusation that the picture on the cover of the Starship’sSpitfire album shows “the whore ofBabylon astride the Beast of Revelation”. Kantner looked pained. “The dragon isa symbol of wisdom and nobility inChina,” he said, “and the girl is a Chinese girl.”Another charge leveled by the fundamentalist was that the song “A Child isComing” on Blows Against theEmpire contained the backwards phrase “the son of Satan”. [The song was writtento commemorate the anticipationof Kantner’s and Grace Slick’s daughter China.] A tape was duly played backwardson the show. I for one heardnothing except backwards music and garbled singing.It would have been a slapstick comedy evening except for the unpleasant surprisethat quite a few peopleevidently believe in such nonsense. It was this blind irrationality that gave mea bit of a chill. In a slightly less 1st-Amendment society than this one, this would be enough to blacklist the PaulKantners, or even to imprison and killthem. I am reminded, per John Fowles’ Aristos, that the reason Christianity nolonger tortures and kills heretics isnot because it has become more tolerant or benevolent doctrinally, but ratherbecause secular society forced it tostop.I had come to the show anticipating an opportunity to discuss some of thefascinating notions on Kantner’sPlanet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra album. Since I spent all of my mike-timedoing little more than denying thatthere were packs of crazed devil-worshippers conducting nameless rites and humansacrifices with Starship musicin the background, I had no opportunity to delve into magic. Nor, I think inretrospect, would most of the radioaudience have been able to understand very much of it. So here comes what KFRCmissed, being notes towardsProject Andromeda -or- How the Devil Really Talks to You Through the PlanetEarth Rock and Roll Orchestra:“The Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra,” says Kantner on the album lyricsheet, “is a San Francisco bandthat, in the near future, develops a computer-assisted telepathic amplificationtechnology. In using the machinerieson everything from their audiences to forms of weather control and extrasensoryspying, they attract the attention ofvarious government and police agencies and right-wing religious forces.”Let’s start with telepathy. Since I wrote “Psi in the Sky” for the Cloven Hoof10 years ago, I have crisscrossedESP looking for bedrock amidst all of the Uri Geller stage magic and JeanneDixon mumbo-jumbo. The idiocy thatstill makes it into “respectable” print never ceases to amaze me - most recentlyTarg & Harary’s Mind Race. Targ is aStanford Research Institute physicist who says that he has worked for a decadeon a “multi-million-dollar programof psychic research financed by the Defense Department and intelligenceagencies”.Targ’s pet project consisted of “remote viewing” experiments, on which Ihappened to be briefed last year at theState Department in Washington, D.C. It was unconvincing, not only because thestatistical data are not reallyconclusive, but also because the transmission of information to the brain simplydoesn’t occur outside the visiblespectrum. Light-waves from the central fountain in Washington Square Park(alleged to have been “seen” by one ofTarg’s subjects) are atmospherically dispersed long before reaching Palo Alto,California.There’s a lot we don’t know about the brain’s internal design, but howinformation travels into and around it isno mystery. Electricity - the same stuff that makes flashlights work. Pleasenote that the electrical impulsesrocketing around in your head are very weak: To light a flashlight bulb youwould have to generate about 30 milliontimes your present level of brain current. Fascinating experiments in ESB(Electrical Stimulation of the Brain) havebeen done by Dr. Jose Delgado of Yale University and are cited in RL#19F.Delgado’s probes, using tiny amounts ofcurrent, were capable of changing moods, stimulating memories, and even causingmotor actions despite theconscious will of the subject to resist. If the human skull were not a goodinsulation against external electricity[which it is], you would have a grand mal seizure and an explosion of utterlyarbitrary thoughts every time youdrove under a high-tension wire.Without going into exhaustive detail, therefore, both light waves and the stuffof which thoughts are made don’ttravel cross-country. If the Pentagon and the intelligence community did in factspend several million dollars onsnake-oil, P.T. Barnum must be rolling merrily around in his grave.Now let’s take a look at why Paul Kantner’s notion of a “computer assistedtelepathic amplification technology”isn’t nearly so fantastic as it seems at first glance.The electrical energy in your brain occurs in waves measured according to cyclesper second (CPS). 1-3 CPS =Delta waves, characteristic of deep sleep. 4-7 CPS = Theta waves, characteristicof high emotion, violence, and- 131 -frustration. 8-12 CPS = Alpha waves, characteristic of meditation, relaxation,and “searching for patterns”. 13-22CPS = Beta waves, characteristic of frontal brain activity, deliberate effort,and logical thought.We’ll come back to brain waves in a moment, but first a word about anotherprinciple: resonance. Resonanceis a very interesting concept and deserves a precise definition:(1) a vibration of large amplitude in a mechanical or electrical system causedby a relatively smallperiodic stimulus of the same or nearly the same period as the natural vibrationperiod of the system.(2) the intensification and enriching of a musical tone by supplementaryvibration that is eithersympathetically or mechanically induced.In Runes #I-2 I provided a short profile of Dr. Nikola Tesla, the “madscientist” who went past the boundaries of“recognized” science with, among other things, experiments in resonance.Biographer Margaret Cheney relates:He attached an oscillator no larger than an alarm clock to a steel link 2’ longand 2” thick. “For a longtime nothing happened, but at last the great steel link began to tremble,increased its trembling until itdilated and contracted like a beating heart, and finally broke.” Sledgehammerscould not have done it, hetold a reporter, crowbars could not have done it, but a fusillade of taps, noone of which would have harmeda baby, did it.Pleased with this beginning, he put the little oscillator in his coat pocket.Finding a half-built steelbuilding in the Wall Street district, 10 stories high with nothing up but thesteelwork, he clamped theoscillator to one of the beams. “In a few minutes I could feel the beamtrembling. Gradually the tremblingincreased in intensity and extended throughout the whole great mass of steel.Finally the structure began tocreak and weave, and the steelworkers came to the ground panic-stricken,believing that there had been anearthquake. Before anything serious happened, I took off the oscillator, put itin my pocket, and went away.But if I had kept on 10 minutes more, I could have laid that building flat inthe street. And with the sameoscillator I could drop Brooklyn Bridge in less than an hour.”Now a little-known but interesting fact is that brain-waves are subject to theprinciple of resonance. Energy-waves reaching your brain through any medium - eyes, ears, or flesh - will tendto induce your brain-waves to cycleat the same wavelength. A common example of visual resonance is the seizuresthat some people experience whenexposed to a light flickering at 10 CPS.The audio spectrum - being the range of sound vibrations which human hearing canconsciously detect - is from15 CPS (bass) to 20,000 CPS (treble). The infrasonic range - 10-15 CPS - is toolow to be consciously detected but isnonetheless capable of inducing resonance in the brain. Below infrasound [andsometimes encompassing it] areExtremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves, which are powerful and durable enough totravel through the Earth forcommunication with submerged submarines.The relaxation which you paradoxically feel when listening to the deep, heavythrobbing of drums and bassguitars at rock concerts is the same as that felt by American Indians listeningto the large dancing-drumsaccompanying their ceremonial campfires. Resonance is produced which inclinesyour brain-waves towards Alpha,and if the rate of the beat seems particularly pleasing to you, I recommend thatyou take your pulse. My guess is thatit will be close (somewhere around 70 CPM), which your system will findsubconsciously soothing. [If you wish tocalm a crying infant, rock its cradle at about that speed, or hold it to yourbreast so that it can hear the beating ofyour heart. Try it!]Now Theta happens to be a very interesting range. Soviet research into PKphenomena has yielded the fact thatPK activity is generally associated with a sudden surge of Theta activity at the4 CPS level. Theta activity is also morecommon in the brains of young children than in those of adults, which may havesomething to do with the rumor(which I cannot call more than that) that “poltergeist” activity is usuallycatalyzed by the presence of a child in thehouse.Now let us suppose for a moment that we have a rock-and-roll band whoseamplifiers, speakers, and acousticalequipment are already well-suited for infrasonic wave generation. Such a band -call it the Jefferson Starship or thePlanet Earth Orchestra, or anything you want to - is currently making peoplevery happy with lots of Alpha-waveresonance. But what if that same band, via computer-assisted technology,produced either sustained or timed/calculated Theta-waves at energy levels strong enough to induce resonancethroughout a concert hall containingthousands of people.

An aerial spirit has entered through the walls that separate mefrom the world.Resplendent with light, purified by the four elements, pure as the genius offire, lift the veil, crimson sky.- Paul Kantner, Planet Earth Rock and Roll OrchestraThe first questions asked by new Setians are usually (1) What is magic? and (2)How can I do it? One of the nextquestions is (3) Where can I do it? The stock answer is “anywhere”, and thecustomary launching-pad is a magicalritual chamber constructed in one’s abode.Yet I am quite serious when I say “anywhere”. This planet is bursting withsuitably magical environments, and abit of amateur detective work, coupled with just keeping your eyes and earsopen, should be sufficient to alert you tomore Satanic Sites than you'd ever dream were in your neighborhood.As a newly-admitted I° in IV/1969, I found myself not in San Francisco Babylon,but in Fort Bragg, NorthCarolina. A bit of delving in local libraries informed me of the existence ofthe nearby “Devil’s Tramping Ground”, asterile circle in the woods around which Old Scratch was wont to pace whilepondering his Great Works. Bravelocals might visit it in the daytime, but none dared go near it at night. I did,of course, and it proved a superb site fora working.Magician’s block is something like writer’s block. There are many Setians whoread enthusiastically aboutmagic and magicians - and then sit around waiting to see others “do magic forthem” or just waiting for more toread.As Black Magic emphasizes, that’s not how to become a magician. You've gotto work actively with theprinciples yourself. At first they will seem awkwardly “mechanical” - andprobably painfully so. On one hand youmay feel ridiculous and self-conscious, particularly if you really screw up whatyou thought would be a most seriousand solemn working. [I have.] On the other hand you might get so effectivelycaught up the working that it goes200% beyond what you planned, and you spend the next several hours pretty shakenup, wondering what on Earth[or under it] you let loose.Once you are in the habit of watching for magical opportunities, an endlessparade of same will pass before you.When Magister DeCecco moved to Las Vegas some time ago, I thought I would callhis attention to the Valley ofFire, a lightning-swept plain encircled by craggy peaks that would make Sauronof Mordor feel right at home. Imight have saved myself the trouble, however, because DeCecco had alreadydiscovered the VoF on his own -because it is second [first!] nature for him to sense such things. And this iswhat I encourage you to do.This article is a sort of case-study about where one such investigation canlead. “Bunny Flat?” you say. Read on -A few Runes issues ago I got reasonably excited about Paul Kantner’s PlanetEarth album. Took Runes readerson a trip through the mechanics of mind-functions and such. Now that's a verybig turkey-breast, and there’s lots ofit in the refrigerator left to eat; but a good magician doesn’t neglect thewings and drumsticks either. In this case oneof the drumsticks was Mount Shasta. [The other one was Australia. I’ll get toAustralia later.]While I may be “a leading figure in the contemporary American occult scene” [perAustralian author NevillDrury], I confess I had paid zero attention to Mount Shasta until the arrival ofPlanet Earth. After reading the notesquoted at the beginning of this article, and listening to the music, mymagician’s nose began to quiver - and so Iwent Shasta-hunting.A good deal of Shasta-data was already buried in my own library & files. It wasquickly supplemented by moredata and then by an expedition. The results of all this have swollen far beyonda Runes article, but here’s a quick &dirty summary. Now once again, the point of all this is not just to tickle youunder the chin with Mount Shasta, butrather to give you an example of the kind of treasure-hunt you can go onwhenever and wherever you choose -which is one of the ways you Become an Adept of the Black Arts instead ofMr./Ms. Average Human Bean.On February 14, 1827 a Hudson’s Bay Company fur scout named Peter Ogden reachedthe top of the SiskiyouMountains in souther Oregon and saw for the first recorded time a peak about 50miles to the south, toweringthousands of feet above surrounding crags. In his diary he wrote: “There is amountain of equal heights to Mount- 133 -Hood. I have named the mountain ‘Sastice’.” Eighty years later the white menwould call it Mount Shasta, but whenOgden asked the Klamatte Indians he found at its base for its name, theyanswered: “He Who Sleeps in the Clouds”.For about the next 60 years Shasta remained just a big, beautiful mountain. Butafter Darwin’s Origin of Specieswas published in 1859, events began to be set in motion that would changeShasta’s image rather markedly.Among the phenomena most troubling to the Darwinists was the little lemur, sinceit [together with other fossil,flora, and fauna specimens] was found in such non-connected locales asMadagascar, India, Africa, and the MalayArchipelago. English Zoologist Philip Sclater hypothesized a primeval land-masscovering this entire area. In honorof the lemur he called it “Lemuria”. Little did he expect what a FrankensteinMonster he had created! Some of themore speculative scientists promptly added to the hypothesis. In the 1870sGerman naturalist Ernst Haeckel wentso far as to propose Lemuria as the ancient home of the human race:Of the five now-existing continents neither Australia nor America nor Europe canhave been thisprimeval home [of man], or the so-called “Paradise” the “cradle of the humanrace”. Besides southern Asia,the only other of the now-existing continents which might be viewed in thislight is Africa. But there are anumber of circumstances, especially chronological facts, which suggest that theprimeval home of man wasa continent now sunk beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean, which extendedalong the south of Asia, as itis at present (and probably in direct connection with it), towards the east, asfar as Further India and theSunda Islands; towards the west as far as Madagascar and the southeastern shoresof Africa ... By assumingthis Lemuria to have been man’s primeval home, we greatly facilitate theexplanation of the geographicaldistribution of the human species by migration.The occultists came running. First on board was Helena Blavatsky of theTheosophical Society. In her 1888 bookThe Secret Doctrine she avowed that the “Book of Dzyan” included an account ofLemuria in addition to Atlantis.Her “Third Root Race” consisted of Lemurians (as “gigantic, brainless, apelikecreatures”). [The fourth RR wasAtlantis. Current humanity is the fifth. The Sixth will evolve from us andreturn to Lemuria, while the Seventh willchuck Earth altogether and emigrate to Mercury.]Later Theosophists embellished Blavatsky’s Lemurian mythos, most notably AnnieBesant and W. Scott-Elliot inhis The Story of Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria (1896). Scott-Elliot’s accountwent into extraordinary detail, offeringa sinister picture of semi-reptilian Lemurians [shades of V] who kept petdinosaurs.While Scott-Elliot was conjuring up Lemurian monsters, an 18-year-oldShasta-area human named FrederickSpencer Oliver began to write a tale which he said had been inspired by adiscarnate personality named “Phylos theTibetan”. Published in 1896 as A Dweller on Two Planets, it became something ofa minor Shasta/occult classic.Oliver/Phylos said nothing about Lemurians, reptilian or otherwise. HisShastoids went by the name of the“Lothinian Brotherhood” and were proper mammals. The Lothinians lived insumptuous caverns within themountain, whose interior was a maze of polished walls and fur-carpeted floors.O/P was guided to this innersanctum by a Dr. Lao-like Chinese initiate named Quong:We halted in from of a huge ledge of basaltic rocks, some hundreds of feet inheight. The ledge wasbroken and twisted as if by some rending convulsion. All about the base lay hugefragments broken off theface of the wall. Against the cliff rested a giant block many tons in weight.Touching this with his hand, theTchin said: “Here is our Sach, our Temple, so to say; this rock is guard at theentrance to a placeremarkable, to say the least, if viewed from an occidental standpoint.”The Lothinian Brotherhood had anticipated George Lucas by some time, as may begleaned from one of theirinstructions to O/P:“Thou art impatient, my brother; know then, what was at one time known upon theEarth, but is now forages forgotten: that Nature has a dual aspect, is double, is positive andnegative; that the great positive sideis the side known to mundane science, while the other or negative or ‘NightSide’ - or, as it was once knownon Earth by the men of Atla ‘Navaz’ - is a side all unknown and scarcely guessedin the most exceedingflights of speculation, left unbroached, secretly kept by a few, who knew notthat they entertain an angel, anangelic wisdom that in a century more, yea, less time! shall overturn much ofthe face of terrene things, shallbestow aerial vessels, and all else once known to those men of Atla of whom Ispoke. Thou dost not yetunderstand?”I said that I did not - that I thought he referred to some domain of thephysical forces not yet known; butwhat had this to do with the Sun?“This: The suns of systems are centers of forces of the Night Side of Naturewhereof I spoke, and areforce and matter of a higher value than are planets and satellites, just aswater above a cataract is trulywater - but being above and mobile, flows over and down, developing energy. Inother words, out of thecold, dark, negative side or ‘Night Side’ force emerges, drawn to the positivepolarity which constitutes in itsoutgoing flow that termed ‘Nature’, and develops in its fall magnetism,electricity, light, color, heat, sound,and lastly solid matter - for this last is a child of energy, not its parent.When the Navaz forces drop to light,if the light waves enter a spectroscope, they will emerge as colors. Thesecorrespond to the various spectrum- 134 -bands and will, as the descent progresses, give the noted lines of the Solarspectrum, as the great ‘B’ line ofoxygen, the conspicuous ‘1474’ line, and the brilliant ‘H’ and ‘K’ violetbands.”Meanwhile the Lemurian link continued to be forged [no pun intended]. Next inline was Rudolph Steiner, whobroke with the Theosophists in 1906 in disgust over Annie Besant’s Krishnamurtiscam. He accepted a charter fromthe German Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and then went on to form his ownAnthrosophical Society. In 1923 hewrote Cosmic Memory: Atlantis and Lemuria, which specifically fingered MountYou-Know-What as a remainingrefuge for You-Know-Who.Back at the Mount Lowe observatory next door to Mount Y-K-W was anastronomer/occultist named EdgarLarkin, who at about the same time decided that it would be interesting to trainhis telescope towards “He WhoSleeps in the Clouds”. Imagine his surprise and delight to see dazzling lightsand colorful pavilions of happyLemurians frolicking on the slopes! Larkin died in 1924 before meeting anyLemurians personally, but the cat wasnow definitely out of the bag where Shasta and Lemuria were concerned.Next to add his 2-cents-worth was H. Spencer Lewis, founder of the AncientMystical Order Rosae Crucis(AMORC) in San Jose.I should pause a moment here to make certain you don't get confused. Lewis gotgoing in occultism in 1909,when he joined one of the splinter-groups of Eliphas Levi’s Ordre Kabbalistiquede la Rose-Croix in France. [Thegroup joined by Lewis was headed by one Josephin Peladan, hence the later rumorthat France harbored a gang ofSatanists called “Palladinists”! Cf. Lillie, Satanism in Modern France.]In 1915 Lewis split from Peladan and, also on the strength of a charter fromO.T.O. chief Theodor Reuss,founded his AMORC in New York. He took it down to Florida in 1925, then to SanJose in 1927. A few years downthe road, after Lewis had survived a scandal and acquired some nice real estate& begun to construct all those fancyEgyptian buildings Setians toured during the Set-V Conclave, Aleister Crowleyshowed up [as new Outer Head of theO.T.O.] and demanded title to the property on the strength of the O.T.O.charter. Lewis ignored him.But Lewis didn't ignore Mount Shasta. In 1931, under the pen-name of “W.S.Cerve”, he authored Lemuria, theLost Continent of the Pacific. None of HPB’s or Steiner’s fooling around forLewis - he got down to specifics, to wit:150,000 years ago people lived on Lemuria, then called Mu for short. 82,000years ago magnetic changes causedcontinental shifts and submergences. Europe rose up, and North & South Americadrifted away from Europe &Africa and bumped into the east coast of Lemuria. Then the west parts of Lemuriasubmerged. Its eastern areabecame what is today Washington, Oregon, California, and parts of Arizona,Nevada, and Mexico.Lewis’ book resulted in all sorts of occultists flocking to Shasta to scroungefor Lemurians, a snipe-hunt stillgoing on today. In 1932 reporter Edgar Lanser wrote an account of Larkin’stelescopic sightings in the Los AngelesTimes Star, and went on to say that Shasta residents enjoyed occasional visitsfrom & commerce with theirLemurian neighbors. Lanser reported mysterious red & green lights on Shasta’sslopes and thus inaugurated one ofthe more durable Shasta legends. Recounts Nigel Pennick in Hitler’s SecretSciences:For over a century occultists have claimed that these special holy mountains arein reality energy centerswhich collect cosmic forces from space and channel them into the “veins of theEarth”, the energy gridcomposed of ley lines.Observations of holy mountains reinforce this assertion. At certain times of theyear, when the energy isat its maximum, strange lights and other phenomena are often seen at suchplaces. Mount Shasta, one of theNative Americans’ sacred peaks, is one such site; for there many inexplicableflashes of light have beenobserved. First recorded by prospectors in the old California gold rush of 1849,these flashes were seen indaylight, and in clear weather when there was no lightning about.Nowadays cars in the vicinity of the mountain develop ignition failure withoutany obvious cause. This isa classic energy manifestation noted in connection with UFOs, Stonehenge, andthe enigmatic “transmitter”Hitler erected on the Brocken peak in Germany.When a vast forest fire engulfed much of the district in 1931, Mount Shasta wassuddenly swathed in amysterious fog. The fire could not burn where the fog protected the mountainpeak. For many yearsafterwards a perfect curve around the mountain marked the furthest advance ofthe flames.Five years after the forest fire had been repulsed by the Lemurians, an occultenthusiast by the name of GuyBallard made a pilgrimage to Mount Shasta. He lucked out and encountered notjust another Lemurian, but agenuine Ascended Master, the Count of Saint Germain. Shasta is evidently one ofthose places where it isfashionable for AMs to be seen. Ballard, at any rate, was so moved that hereturned to lesser humankind to foundthe “I AM” organization. \"I AM\" prospered until 1939, when Ballard died and theorganization was hauled into courton mail fraud charges. “I AM”, however, has proven to be the most durable Shastafan club, as it is todayheadquartered in the town of Mount Shasta and puts on a Jesus Christ pageantevery August.In 1946 another Shasta enthusiast named Eugene Thomas wrote The Brotherhood ofMount Shasta, a dreamy,Dunsany-like tale of Lemurian mystery & mysticism at the Mount:Australia is what remains of a vast continent which existed so far back in thehistory of the world thatmen now seldom dare speak of it; and if they do speak of it, most of what theysay is theory and conjecture.- 135 -Only those whose souls are able to lift the curtain of the past can really tellyou anything about thatmysterious land. When you have been sufficiently instructed, and have diligentlystriven to carry out theinstructions received, go to the western coast of the American continent, to anextinct volcano whose nameis Shasta. If your preparation be sufficient, your sincerity unquestionable, anancient Brotherhood will befound that will guide you to the place where you may be further instructed.Australia again! Come on, Australian Setians - What’s really going on DownUnder? We await a report withbaited breath - and if you turn out to be Lemurian lizards in human disguise,you get two free passes to the set of V.The upshot of all this was that a visit to Shasta seemed the thing to do. InAugust Lilith and I headed north onHighway #101 to the Oregon Caves to sample a proper Lemurian atmosphere. Setianswho have not yet gone cave-delving (“spelunking”) are encouraged to do so if you are near suitablefacilities such as the O.C., Carlsbad, KentuckyCaves, etc. [But don’t go fooling around in unexplored or unmarked caves if youare not a seasoned spelunker; theDEROs might nab you.]After a side trip to Crater Lake (another magical spot), we headed back downHighway #97 into California,getting much the same first-view of Shasta that so impressed Peter Ogden 157years ago. Arriving in the town ofMount Shasta, we checked in at the “Tree House”, recommended by the LemurianTourist Association as the placeto stay.The next morning, Sunday 8/11, happened to be the date of the annual “I AM”Jesus pageant, complete withIAMers in bedsheets and angel-wings. It is a harmless enough local tradition, Isuppose, but somehow a bit out ofout-of-place at this Lemurian outpost. We would have preferred something withflying saucers, lizard-people, andoh-wow light shows on the mountain at night. [The modern-day Egyptians havetheir heads together on this, whichis why you can see a great spooky nighttime sound and light show at Giza andLuxor these days.]We couldn’t take very much of the Jesus play, so decided we’d have to go findLemurians on our own. Actually itwas an ideal time to head for the mountain, as everyone else was at the I AMJesus show.There is one highway, the Everitt Memorial Highway, which leads out of the towntowards the mountain. Itwinds up along the side of the mountain for about 13 miles, terminating at BunnyFlat and nearby Panther Meadowat an elevation of 7,000’ (halfway up to the 14,161’ summit). From theremountaineers must hoof it, and be prepared- as we found out - for some shortness of breath.We had decided to check the Theta-wave patterns of our brains en route, via apair of Biosone-I portablemonitors [available from Edmund Scientific Corp.]. The B-I can almost bemistaken for a Walkman, except that youhave to tolerate one electrode on your scalp and a clip on your earlobe inaddition to the earphone. The few humanswho had gone to Bunny Flat instead of the Jesus show probably thought we wereLemurians!Both of our Theta readings were markedly higher than in town the day before, butthe high altitude [and somegreat pizza at the Tree House] may have had something to do with the changedreading. Also there were somepeople at Panther Meadow pounding frenziedly on tom-toms, which tended todistract one's attention, hence one’sbrain-wave pattern.It was immediately evident why Shasta has developed its esoteric reputation, asthere is undeniably a pleasantlyexhilarating atmosphere atop the mountain. This is true of most mountains, to besure, but Shasta has a“something” that I haven't felt, say, atop Mount Whitney (California’s highestpeak, which I climbed 20 years ago).I don't know if Paul Kantner sampled Shasta personally before creating PlanetEarth, but the music and themountain are assuredly in synch. It is high time [pun intended this time] for amidnight ceremony atop Shasta,complete with PER&RO & Lemurian music, banks of red & green carbon lasers a laLaserium blazing off into thesky, and Lemurians, Star Scouts, Setians, and any other extraterrestrials orjust extra-special terrestrials whohappen to drop by for the occasion. I think we can go the “I AM” Jesus show onebetter.______________________________"},{"pageContent":"PART IV: WONDERS DOWN UNDERFirst published: Scroll of Set #XIV5October XXIII/1988Australia ... Oz and Beyond“Oz”, oddly enough, is the name some Australians attach to their country. It ishere that the band flees,to a settlement deep in the blisteringly-hot Australian Outback. Over fifteenhundred people have formed asettlement that is nearly totally self-sufficient. Weather control, lakes,forests, mountains, undergroundagriculture, and huge machines all serve to support this community.U.S. government agents eventually discover the settlement and launch an attackto recover theextrasensory technology for Cold War use. The children of the settlementconstruct a telepathic shieldaround the colony, and they escape into space in the “edge of your seat” climax.- Paul Kantner, Planet Earth Rock and Roll OrchestraThe Temple of Set now has a pretty sizable number of Initiates in Australia, andthat has turned my attention allthe more towards that very interesting continent. All regions of the world havetheir weird and magical aspects, and- 136 -Australia is no exception. When you go to the local library to look upAustralian mythology, however, conventionalbooks assume you want to know about the legends and superstitions of theAborigines rather than about theforbidden, subterranean city of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Shadow Out of Time.Accordingly I have appealed to some of our Aussie Initiates for informationconcerning the shadowy aspects oftheir homeland - and particularly the Outback, where Paul Kantner plans to movethe Planet Earth Rock & RollOrchestra prior to its lift-off towards Andromeda. [And if you, dear reader, arean Australian whom I haven’t yet hitup for Sinister Truths about the continent, you are hereby solicited. Pleasetell us about Australia - either by letter tome or by direct article for the Scroll. Thanks!]In the meantime I might point out that I am not the first person to be confusedabout Australia. For a greatmany centuries the entire world was unsure whether it existed or not. Therebyhangs the tale of Terra AustralisIncognita, the “Unknown Southern Land”, which gets a chapter to itself in acharming book by Raymond H. Ramsayentitled No Longer on the Map: Discovering Places That Never Were (NY: VikingPress, 1972).This book recounts the most famous, infamous, and occasionally slapstick casesof continents, islands, sea-passages, cities, and civilizations whose existence was at one time taken forgranted - and then which, after thewasting of lots of time, money, and sailing expeditions, were grudgingly andruefully acknowledged to be puffs offluff.Fortunately Atlantis and Mu/Lemuria are not in the book, else there wouldbe room for little besides in view ofthe mammoth amount of material penned about those two turkeys. But there arechapters on El Dorado, theNorthwest Passage, a variety of R’yleh-like now-you-see-it-now-you-don’tislands, the Seven Cities of Cibola, avariety of other geographical curiosities.Now the fun thing about Australia is that it was presumed to be there longbefore it was discovered. The storybegins with the Alexandrian Greek astronomer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy. Inhis day sensible scientistsknew the world ( ge) was round, and it was proposed by Krates of Mallos in the2nd century BCE that there had to beroughly equal land-masses on all surfaces in order to “balance” the knownportion ( oikoumene). Otherwise theworld wouldn’t stay upright [the Greeks hadn’t got gravity, orbital rotation,etc. quite worked out yet].Ptolemy is most famous in history for his bright but wrong idea that the Sun andplanets revolve around theEarth. He had another wrong idea about Terra Australis, which appears for thefirst time on a 1482 edition of one ofhis maps as a gigantic land mass occupying the bottom of the globe, and of whichAfrica is a northern peninsula. [Inthe 7th century BCE an Egyptian Pharaoh had sent a Phoenician expedition aroundthe Cape of Good Hope, butPtolemy shrugged that off. To be fair to him, so did Herodotus. Ignoringinconvenient data is not only a modernphenomenon.]It is commonly supposed that medieval Europeans thought the world was flat. Infact, following the authority ofAristotle, it was assumed [in learned circles, at least] to be spherical. SinceGod could hold the planet together in anyway He chose to, however, it was no longer thought necessary to have land massesjust for the sake of weight-distribution. Australia went off the map.Besides, argued theologians, God would not have been so wasteful of space tocreate all that land withoutpeople, and if there were people there, they would be heathen and in need ofconversion, and if no one could get tothem, they couldn’t be converted, which was outrageous. There couldn’t possiblybe any other people besides thosewithin reach of Christianity. It was definitely better to keep Australia off themap.[A little later America was (re)discovered, and there were indeed native peoplethere. Some theologiansproposed that these “Indians” were not true people but an evil race created bythe Devil. Orthodox dogma said thatonly God could create, however, so the native inhabitants of the Americas wenton to receive the blessings of theChristian missionary efforts. As this issue of the Scroll goes to press, theCatholic Church is proceeding to canonizeJunipero Serra for his California missionary activities, despite the protests ofnative Americans who recall thereligious persecution of their ancestors somewhat less reverently.]Terra Australis was decreed not to exist because it was unreachable, and it wasunreachable because theequator was decreed to be uncrossable because it was thought to be hot andburnt-out. One day someone sailedacross it at sea and noticed that he didn’t burn up. After the generalastonishment died down, enthusiasts such asPortugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator commissioned all sorts of mappingexpeditions.Once Columbus rediscovered America, it seemed that old Krates was right. Therehad to be more land sprinkledaround the globe until one got round to the oikoumene again. In the 16th & 17thcenturies CE Terra AustralisIncognita was re-added to the map. So far no one had actually bumped into ityet.There were a couple of near-misses. In 1545 the Spaniard Inigo Ortis de Retesdiscovered New Guinea andsupposed it to be a northern peninsula of TAI. The Peruvian Alvaro de Mendana deNeyra found some islands in1567, which he named the Solomons in hopes that he would find similar treasurethere. [Perhaps it was lunchtimewhen Captain Cook reached Hawaii.]In 1603, having fired up the Pope and Philip III of Spain with tales of Pacifictreasures to be reaped, de Retes’lieutenant, Pedro Fernandes de Quieros, went out to try again. He came back withwild tales about a new continentlarger than Europe and packed with more gold than Peru. He called it Austrialiadel Espiritu Santo and said that hehad formally laid the cornerstone for a city named New Jerusalem there. Actuallyhe had found the New Hebrides,but no one believed him anyway.Meanwhile the cartographers were having fun. On the maps of the time TAI waspositioned everywhere fromunderneath Africa to underneath South America, and everywhere in between.Guesses ranged from island-size to- 137 -something big enough to reach from Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope. Thefamous Turkish Piri Reis map joinsSouth America to TAI, places 6-horned oxen there, and adds the notation that“the Portuguese infidels haverecorded it in their maps”.In 1613 the Dutchman Dirck Hartog published his sighting of the Australiancoast, and thereafter the Dutchpoked around a bit. In 1629, in the best European tradition, they took a whirlat starting a colony. Captain FrancisPelsart set off from Java with a small fleet. Unfortunately he took a Haarlempirate by the name of Jerome Corneliusalong. The expedition crashed on the Abrolhos Islands (in Portuguese:“Keep-Your-Eyes-Open Islands”). Ramsayreports how it all turned out:Exactly what happened then is not clear; whether Pelsart took some of the partyand sailed back to gethelp, or whether Cornelius held his mutiny on land and drove out Pelsart andthose loyal to him. In any caseCornelius ended up in control. He killed some 40 of the men to save watersupplies, took over all of thewomen for himself and his followers, and held a brief reign that was asuccession of drunken orgies. He alsokilled several more of the men on suspicion of disloyalty to him, including thetwo ship’s carpenters, andwas thus unable to carry out his plan of salvaging material from the wrecks,building another ship, andbecoming a pirate. When Captain Pelsart and his men unexpectedly returned,Cornelius was overthrownand was summarily tried and hanged.As colonizing goes this was not exactly a high point. The Dutch more or lesssaid to Hell with it, and the rest ofthe world agreed. Cartographers of the 17th century were accustomed to map onlyknown areas, leaving unexploredareas blank. So Australia went back off the map for another 100 years.Of course everyone knew it was still down there somewhere. The fantasy writersof the day knew a good thingwhen they saw it, grinding out many tales set there of which Jonathan Swift’sGulliver’s Travels is the best-known.The basket-cases checked in too: In 1676 the Franciscan monk Gabriel de Foigny,already notorious for hisscandalous life, published La Terre Australe Connue in which he revealed thatthe natives of Australia werehermaphrodites who used a special breed of long-nosed pigs to root in straightlines, thereby tilling the ground forthem.This nonsense went on until 1768, with a succession of maps showing TAI here,there, or nowhere, and NewZealand and Tasmania similarly growing or shrinking in size at the whim of thecartographer. Finally the famousCaptain Cook went down to explore and chart the area, and he got a grip onAustralia. It went back on the map, andin reasonably correct proportions, and thereafter its exploration, settlement,and political history leaves the realm ofmagic and enters that of conventional history.____________________________________________________Part V: Classified Introduction to PERRO: The Novel114XXXVIII/2003Paul Kantner shot bolt-upright in his bed, his eyes frozen and unfocused, teethclenched: awake. Yes, awake -It had happened again.The panic began to recede. He felt his muscles relax; he saw the room, smelledperspiration, tasted blood,realized with annoyance that he must have bitten his lip. He swung his body offthe bed, scowled at the twistedsheets, and walked unsteadily into the bathroom.The cold shower helped his body, but the ghost of the dream was still there:* * *He was standing on Hollywood Boulevard. It had to be the Boulevard, becausenowhere else could you feelthat sodden atmosphere of dreams, glamor, failure, corruption - at once thethrill of being There, at the nerve centerof Fame, yet you can’t touch it, your fingers press against the cold stars ofthe dead stars; they are an eternity away.But above him -Above him - it had somehow been there all along - the ... machine. Machine? Whatother word ..? It was high,distant, perhaps ten thousand feet in the air. But he couldn’t be sure, becauseit enveloped the entire Los AngelesBasin like some gigantic black amoeba of leathermetal, pulsing quietly, wetly.But it was not endless, because thereto the far south was still a sliver of bright blue sky.Transfixed, he clutched the hand - her hand, Lilith’s hand; she was there withhim, her hair cascading in theelectric wind of the machine, her face darkly glowing in its blazing pulses. Hehad turned, then, slowly, to smile ather: This is a great dream.But she shook her head and laughed. “It’s no dream, lover.”114 [The unclassified version by Paul Kantner, within the novel, can be orderedfrom the Jefferson Starship website:http://www.jeffersonstarshipsf.com/main.htm][http://www.jeffersonstarshipsf.com/main.htm%5D]- 138 -It was somehow very important that he answer her, but he was whirled away tostare at a 1949 Mercury, garishin candy-apple paint, cruising down the Boulevard toward them, its ancient AMradio blaring tinny, low-fi music(though he couldn’t make out the tune). Now the car was still, but the musicmust have continued, because twoyouths, a boy in a plastic bodysuit and a girl with green hair, were suddenlybeside it, music-swaying, staring up atthe machine. They obviously didn’t see the door.But Paul did, because Lilith guided his eyes to it.

Moving in angles, with electricity, she drew him towards the opening.The Boulevard remained an inert spectator, motionless save for the dancing formsnext to the Mercury, silentbut for the music which must have been there for them. Falling towards the doorin the sky, Paul looked slowly toone side, then the other, and was rewarded, preposterously, with reflections ofLilith and himself, both in leatherS&M costumes, in Frederick’s of Hollywood’s display-window. But it was too hotto be wearing them, he knew,because he was gasping with the heat, tearing the leather away from his bodythat now shone, like Lilith’s, with wetelectricity, which he also tried to brush from his arms, but it ran ahead of hisfingers over his body.Lilith, now completely a sculpture of electrical angles, was pulling him,finally, ultimately, through the -* * *Paul Kantner turned off the shower, ran a towel impatiently over his body, andpadded back out into thebedroom, where Albert Einstein smiled fuzzily at him, riding, as always, hisbicycle across the M.I.T. campus, frozenforever in that faded wall-poster. Paul rummaged in the bedside drawer for hisrimless, rectangular glasses - asmuch his trademark as Indiana Jones’ fedora, he supposed - and winked back at anow-crisp Albert through them.The Sun, he saw from his window, had just crept above Mount Diablo over in theEast Bay, and was sendingwarm rays of golden light across San Francisco to break, finally, against thered towers of the Bridge. He neverceased to marvel at the contrast between the two worlds on either side of theGolden Gate: the bustling cosmopolisto the east, the Tolkienesque crags and seascape to the west.For perhaps the tenth time in so many days he considered the dream, ornightmare, or whatever-it-was. Atfirst he had dismissed it as the reverie of a brain pretty well saturated, hegranted, with science-fiction imagery. Butnow a slight worry had begun to creep in. The same dream, too many times. Whatthe hell.He sat down on the mangled bed, found the phone on the floor next to it, buriedunder a pillow. At last it wasthe date; the thing should finally be here. He began to dial ...* * *It had begun with Blows Against the Empire, that 1970 spaceflight-of-fancy albumwhich had won PaulKantner both a Hugo Award nomination (which he knew about) and a DefenseIntelligence Agency file (which hedidn’t).DIA, located across the Anacostia River from Washington, D.C., was the DefenseDepartment’s in-houseanswer to the civilian Central Intelligence Agency. CIA, after years of moresensationalism and media glamor than itcared for, had been rewarded with a good deal of Executive and Congressionalwatchdoggery. DIA reported only tothe Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because it hadso-far-successfully maintained that its onlyconcerns were strategic national defense intelligence.But in the aftermath of the 1969 Apollo-11 Moon-landing, the NationalAeronautics & Space Administration’scivilian funding for its sensible but unglamorous Space Shuttle program hadbegun to dry up. NASA did what manyanother desperate agency has done under such circumstances; it went knocking onthe doors of the Pentagon. CouldDoD help with the bills?Yes, it could. But there was a price. Those old, quaint ideas about peaceful useof space, about shuttles to carrycivilian research and commercial packages, even tourists, as a possible preludeto orbital space colonies? - off thetable. The shuttles will now be doing - our business. Special satellites. Forintelligence, for secure communications,for space-based defense. You don’t have a need to know exactly what they do.Your job is just to get them up thereand keep them there.None of which was known by, or of the slightest concern to Paul Kantner when hewrote and sang a series ofsongs about hijacking the United States’ first functional spaceship forpacifistic planetary touring. However DIA,which now had assumed a counterintelligence mission regarding the “new” NASA,decided that it was concernedabout him. Was he serious? Wasn’t that Jefferson Airplane of his one of thoseagitation-bands that had workedright along with Jane Fonda and Daniel Berrigan to fuck up the Vietnam War? Turnan entire generation of once-well-bred Eisenhower kids into long-haired acidheads? Now that the war isfalling to pieces, are we going to have toworry about interference with our space programs?In April 1971 the Kantner file was tasked to the Missile & Space IntelligenceCommand (MSIC) of DIA’sambiguously-named Directorate for Analysis & Production (DI), where it waseventually Compartmented andultimately, on January 17, 1972, designated with an MJ-prefix, removing itinstantly from DIA’s normal IntelligenceLibrary tracking system.DI/MSIC/MJ agents thus carefully followed the progress of Kantner and his band,now the Jefferson Starship,through the 1970s. Their tours, interviews, lyrics, and private lives wereannotated to the file and scheduled forperiodic analysis.- 139 -By 1975 MJ’s interest had lessened somewhat. The NASA security issues raised byBlows showed no signs ofmaterializing, and while several additional Kantner space-themes had beenintroduced, all were clearly in the realmof fantasy. That was, until ..._____________________Part VI: PERRO Alive!Leaked from highly-suspect sources 2013 under blanket anonymity.All the following strictly denied by all the individuals and organizationsherein.Exactly thirty years ago PERRO introduced the idea of covert mass mind controlby technological means(“Fred”). As developed in that record and novel, Fred, a “black box” connectedbetween guitars and amplifiers, wasused to create a sort of dreamy ecstasy in concert crowds unaware of the device.A malicious U.S. governmentbecame aware of its effectiveness, and sought to steal both it and presumablythe telepaths (Paul Kantner and GraceSlick, alias “Lilith”) for Cold War black operations exploitation. After Gracepaid a psychically-revitalizing visit toMount Shasta, the two of them fled to Australia, and then, cornered by pursuers,into space.This made me wonder whether something like that were indeed possible, and thatset me on the research paththat ultimately resulted in my MindWar (MW) project. Not a plug-in amplifierbox, but an entire interrelated systemof physical forces, capable of not just inducing vague, aimless euphoria, butreaching right back into the core ofhuman thought architecture to neutralize murderous and destructive emotions. 115Many readers of MindWar have suggested that an illustration of its applicationmight be a useful supplement.Perhaps a satire of a “classified/ leaked” PERRO? Such an “exposé” would divergefrom its official forerunner byvarious extrapolations and elaborations, to be sure:PERRO-1:Fred was designed for a select group of people to have a superfeelgood time:sort of one of the old1960s’ Be-Ins or perhaps Kesey’s Acid Tests dialed all the way up.MW-1:MW is designed to overcome and end the curse of physical warfare (PW) on aglobal scale. Itproduces an atmosphere of enlightened cooperation towards acceptablecompromises, that’s all.[While its ParaPolitics function goes on to replace destructive, predatorycommunities withmorally-beneficial ones, that comes later.]PERRO-2:PERRO portrays the U.S. government, and presumably subordinate/ allied ones, asevil; Fred mustbe kept from them at all costs.MW-2:MW is a concept which is designed for government implementation. It presumesthat the PWhabits of the government are not intentionally evil, simply events-reactive andcontainment-oriented. When the government’s band-aid diplomatic efforts fail, it knowsnothing else to doexcept lash out with PW force. MW provides it with a positive alternative.PERRO-3:In PERRO Mt. Shasta is vague and fictional, its influence unclear.MW-3:After PERRO appeared, I did considerable research into the history and lore ofthe mountain [Cf.Part 3], and of course have the background to draw these out in terms of preciseesoteric principlesinvolving the planetary electromagnetic grid, ley lines, feng-shui, geomancy,and sacred geometry.Relative to MW, Shasta can serve as a laboratory for experimentation with andevaluation of thesevarious geophysical forces and influences on local humans, providing a schematicfor such analysesand applications in actual foreign crises.PERRO-4:In PERRO Australia’s significance is also unclear.MW-4:I took a close look at it too [Cf. Part 4], and as it happens it is quite acomplex place, mixinghistorical mystique with modern troubles of its own. [Some years ago an AussieSetian sent me acopy of John Pilger's A Secret Country, which was quite the eye-opener.] As ithappens, theAustralia of the 21st century is beset with a number of its own internal andexternal political andsocial stresses, and might indeed make a good test-subject for a MW campaign toaddress them.PERRO-5:In PERRO Paul & Grace go to space, but where, why, and how?115 MindWar was published in book form in 2013 (2nd Edition 2016), and was bothcirculated within the U.S. government andreleased to the public. It can be obtained here:http://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Aquino/e/B01GEWRIMU- 140 -MW-5:In FireForce I took them to Andromeda, in slightly different bodies, of course,and with availabletranslite technology kindly detailed by STF General Dakkar. 116 While there’s aninternational spacestation up in Earth orbit, Blows’ starship has yet to materialize. Neverthelesswe are getting closer.In MW-the-novel they will doubtless get their conspiratorial feet wet incollusion with SpaceAdventures, 117 and by the time of their cornered escape hitch a ride on VirginGalactic. 118 Does thishave anything to do with MW? Not really, but it would be a fun way to finale thestory!PERRO-6:In PERRO Grace/“Lilith” was a telepath, though what sort of one or how it cameabout isunexplained. Some of the malign interest of the Blue Meanies, presumably, has todo with gettingcontrol over her for research or exploitation purposes. This prompts her andPaul’s flight toAustralia, and, when cornered there, final escape into space.MW-6:MW has to do not just with external physical and sensory principles whichcondition humanthought, but with increasing one’s control over and coherence of one’s ownthought-processesthrough recognition and direction of such externalities. The result is in effecta “supermentality”,which does not generate mythical powers; it just refines and perfects the oneswhich are presentlyincoherent and confused. Here there are two different possibilities:•Grace’s exposure to an alignment of geophysical confluences at Shasta affectsher in thisrespect.•Paul’s original, traumatic exposure to the “Bell” at Cheyenne Mountain [seebelow]permanently mutates his brain: somewhat similar to the Krel mind-expansionprocedure in thefilm Forbidden Planet.Thus mentally-enhanced in somewhat different ways, Paul and Grace are uniquelyqualified toapply MW to Australia, including a nationwide adaptation of FRED to all of itsnational media. Fora bit of extra fun, scenes and settings from a number of suitably-themedJefferson Airship songswill make real-life appearances: Rock and Roll Island, Song to the Sun, Lawman,Crown ofCreation, Dark Ages, When the Earth Moves Again, Holding Together ...What portends our dynamental duo’s extraterrestrial exodus? In the originalPERRO they and anumber of their friends/disciples were besieged, and it was an escape ofdesperation. With asuccessful MW campaign, however, Australia is not hostile to them, certainly.Space/dimensional“escape” finales, as in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the ThirdKind, and IndianaJones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skul l have all fallen back on enigmaticfade-out, for theobvious reason that the writers have no idea where to go next. I do, but willwait until I get to thispoint to make it explicit.Paul Kantner’s original libretto and accompanying novel for PERRO wereblissfully artistic and vagueconcerning the structural locations, events, organizations, and personalities ofthe adventure. As much attention ashe devoted to such interactivity, he was limited to sketching them from “theoutside”. A MW version of these sameevents would pass behind the veils into the actual machinery of the visible andshadow governments of the UnitedStates [and Australia]. Indeed so highly-charged is some of this that coming upwith a too-explicit “PERRObackstory” could cause real-world difficulties, and even personal danger, to thestory’s nonfictional models. Whatfollows here, therefore, should be considered an illustrative outline only:* * *As recounted in Part #5, the “classified backstory” of PERRO dates back toPaul’s 1972 notice by and eventual1975 contact from the Defense Intelligence Agency DI/MSIC. Though understandablydubious about such ominousinstitutions, Paul’s fascination with space finally convinced him to acceptappointment as a DIA Contract Agent,upon which he was given a Top Secret/Special Compartmented Intelligence (TS/SCI)clearance, with access toMSIC’s MJ/Majestic compartment, concerned with active extraterrestrialintelligence [as complement to the TK/Talent Keyhole passive compartment]. In this capacity he was called uponoccasionally as a consultant forevaluation of “peculiarities” of undisclosed origin and function at Groom Lake,Nevada and the U.S. SpaceCommand at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.116 See Part VII. The book FireForce (2016) is also available at:http://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Aquino/e/B01GEWRIMU117 http://www.spaceadventures.com118 http://www.virgingalactic.com- 141 -It was at USSPACECOM’s nearby Cheyenne Mountain facility that Paul was summonedin 1977 to assess whatwould later be fictionalized as the “stargate” of the eventual movie andtelevision series. He was severely, butfortunately only temporarily injured when it was activated. That device servedto artificially enhance the brainwavesof humans in its transmission range, but only through simultaneous increase inmagnetic fields to physiologically-harmful levels. The source of the device Paul never learned, though he latersuspected it was either the original or acopy of the legendary “Bell” originally invented by Luftwaffe scientists in NaziGermany and later acquired by the SSAdvanced Projects Section under the notorious SS General Dr. Ing. Hans Kammler.After his emergency evacuation to the nearby hospital of the U.S. Air ForceAcademy, Paul returned to SanFrancisco. During his convalescence he wondered whether a much-milder version ofthe Cheyenne artifact could beused to enhance the effects of music. Over the years he had become very familiarwith his band’s ability to, as heonce put it, “become a great churning air machine, capable of moving people tothe unknown, of making you cry,laugh, march in silly parades”. Clearly this was a composite effect of both theliminal (=lyrics) and subliminal(=music) elements of songs, transmitted within the audio range of theelectromagnetic spectrum (16-16,384 Hz).What might happen if the same mathematical pulses and proportions were recreatedthroughout the entire EMS?Could human audiences detect them through sub/supra-resonance? The result mightbe a sort of “metamusic” thatwould penetrate not just to audiencees’ conscious pleasure centers, but to theirvery souls.Through Majestic Paul was able to obtain in 1978 both tasking and funding forsuch a mechanism to beengineered and constructed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) in Arlington. It was giventhe classified project name FRED (Frequency Resonance Enhancement Device), andconsisted of miniaturized,extremely high-velocity counterrotating electrocharged cylinders, LOX-cooled andinsulated by a syntheticrubberized compound of extraordinary molecular density.By 1980 FRED was deemed ready for testing beyond DARPA’s secure laboratories.Disguised as just anotherunremarkable amplifier case, FRED was delivered to Paul in San Francisco,whereupon he installed it in JeffersonStarship concert apparatus and began to activate it at its lowest energy level.The results were immediate, astonishing, and audience-indetectible. Tension anddiscord, always somethingof a problem at emotion-stimulating concerts, suddenly and completely vanished,to be replaced by a sense ofecstatic pleasure and affection almost tangible in its pervasiveness. Theever-pervasive scent of marijuanadisappeared completely, as did any indication of other drugs and alcohol;audiences clearly felt no further need ofthem whatever. Starship concerts became something much more than mereentertainment events; they were massrejuvenations of both the minds and bodies of those who experienced them. Therewere indications that certainbodily infections and diseases were either completely cured or substantiallylessened, though in order to preservethe security surrounding FRED, no direct medical confirmation of this waspossible.If this effect could be generated through concert speaker systems, which wereclearly emitting frequenciesbeyond the audio spectrum, wondered Paul, could the same results be achievedthrough recording? Again throughMajestic he requested and received a specially-insulated facility within theNASA compound at Moffett Naval AirStation, a short distance south of San Francisco. Constructed as a massive“Faraday cage”, this remarkableengineering enclosure, whose interior was a complete forest of pyramidal deadzones, made it possible to modifyinstrumental and voice recordings in which every single frequency was preciselyconfigured. The result was acomposite wave assemblage which, while sounding like perfectly ordinary music tothe human ear, extendedthrough radios or other conventional playback systems to almost the entire rangeof the EMS.In 1983 Paul, Grace, and several of their friends recorded a new “personal”album of his, Planet Earth Rockand Roll Orchestra, in San Francisco. He then took the master tapes down toMoffett, where their frequencies wereprocessed through FRED and then in the “clean room” re-imprinted on tofull-range digital media provided byDARPA. This was then reduced to a new set of master tapes used to create thePERRO commercial record, cassette,and later CD.Neither DIA nor DARPA possessed the resources to attempt to collect and measurethe results of PERROsales, of course, and once again there were obvious security constraints. The1980s had already seen “witch hunt”scares of “hidden messages”, “back-masking”, “satanism”, and similar nonsenserippling around the country. Eventhe slightest hint of anything like FRED would have unleashed a storm ofparanoia and hysteria. In March of 1984there was a joint DIA/MSIC, DARPA, and FBI meeting at Fort McNair, Washington,D.C. to determine whether theFBI, which had federal authorization for domestic intelligence, could examineany “unusual impact” of the PERROalbum on listeners. Exactly what that “impact” might be, and for that mattereven the existence of Majestic, wereundisclosed. The cover story was that the album, like its Blows Against theEmpire predecessor, containedpolitically-subversive themes. Surviving memoranda of that meeting indicate thatthe FBI was unconvinced of anyserious necessity for such an investigation, and declined it. To this day theFRED-configuration of the album, and itsimpact if any upon its audience, remains a statistical mystery.And there the story of Paul, Grace, FRED, and PERRO might have ended, except forthe aftereffects of animpulsive visit by Grace to Mount Shasta in 1981. While hiking with friends inthe wilderness above Bunny Flat atthe end of the access road, Grace apparently became separated from hercompanions [though two of them were toinsist she had simply vanished from sight right before their startled eyes]. Afrantic search ensued, in which bynightfall the Forest Service was asked to help. But before formal emergencyrescue procedures were activated, shewas found, unconscious but apparently unharmed, at the edge of Panther Meadow.When she awoke, she curtly and- 142 -steadfastly claimed that she could not remember what had happened to her,although certain themes in PERROsuggest that she later gave a far different story to Paul.The Shasta incident had one definite and immediate consequence: The two of thempostponed work on thePERRO album for a sudden, and equally-unexplained trip to Australia. There theyrented a Land Rover and set outfor the Ayers Rock, with overheard-mention of the “City of Dreams”. The severaldays that followed were marked bya series of intense lightning storms at the Rock, together with explosions ofcolored lighting effects that localsguessed were some sort of freak displacement of the well-known Aurora Australis.A short time later the twoAmericans were back in Sydney to return the car and catch a return flight to theUnited States. Once again theymade no direct comment to anyone concerning their trip, but once again thecontents of PERRO, when theysubsequently resumed work on it, went through some extremely odd and suggestivechanges. When years later Paulwas contacted by DIA to recommend a suitable test-situation for thenewly-developed MW concept, he proposedAustralia.* * *Whether this “classified backstory” of PERRO ever sees novelization remains tobe seen. Meanwhile:______________________________Part VII: FireForce Introductory Documents-from FireForce by Michael A. AquinoMay 1, 2016http://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Aquino/e/B01GEWRIMU"},{"pageContent":"PREFACEBy the mid-1970s the social-revolutionary euphoria of the 1960s had run itscourse: Realization set in that theutopian paradise vaguely envisioned by the Hippies and Yippies was not going tomaterialize after all. The UnitedStates and the rest of the world were going to continue trudging along in thesame materialistic, repressive, andoligarchic way as before. If anything, the future outlook was worse, not better.One of the reactions to this, especially among the disillusioned post-World WarII generation, was escapism: the“drop out” advocated and romanticized by gurus such as Timothy Leary. This wasmost directly reflected in“survivalist” movements: individuals and groups who cut their community ties ndmoved to remote locales inemulation of Henry Thoreau’s Walden or John Steinbeck’s Travels With Charley.Sometimes such reclusion reached paranoid and violent extremes, resulting inarmed “militias” confrontingstate or federal law-enforcement.One of the more novel and exciting expressions of this escapism was its ultimateextreme: rejection of the entireplanet. The advent of the Space Shuttle seemed to presage an age in whichpersonal or group access to space wouldbe practical, and in 1975 physicist Gerard O’Neill founded the L5119[index_split_007.html#p142]Society to work towards the establishment ofself-contained orbital space colonies. 120 [index_split_007.html#p142]Thefollowing year O’Neill’s book The High Frontier became a best-seller,and Professor Leary happily transferred his “drop out” prescription to “drop up”instead.Perhaps the first artistic expression of this new space-escapism occurred in1970, when the Jefferson Airplane’sPaul Kantner released his “Jefferson Starship” album Blows Against the Empire,singing the story of the hijackingof the United States’ first starship by 7,000 New Age “gypsies” and theirsubsequent galavant around the cosmos a lapeace, partying, and pot. “No pigs,” avowed Captain XM-1, “are going to make itto the cities of the universe.” 121 [index_split_007.html#p142]All of which is to say that when a San Anselmo protégé of Francis Ford Coppolanamed George Lucas created afantasy movie about an alienated youth grappling with an oppressive governmentin outer space, a worldwideaudience was primed for exactly that. Star Wars was more than a successfulmovie; it immediately became a socialphenomenon. Long after the original 1970s’ space-escapism had dissipated - theSpace Shuttle became militarizedand the L5 Society faded into a mere NASA fan club - Star Wars would remain acult attraction as enduring asJames Bond or Star Trek.1977’s Star Wars, in addition to being a nonstop barrage of classic adventurecliff-hangers, was energized bywondrous special-effects and a Wagnerian soundtrack by John Williams. Somesmerizing was Williams’ score that itwould itself generate scores of reperformances nd interpretations by everythingfrom full orchestras to jazz bands,MOOGs, disco, and cathedral pipe organs.As with Walt Disney and Davy Crockett, Star Wars’ megasuccess caught its creatorby surprise. While themovie and Lucas’ accompanying novelization gave every indication of being astand-alone story, this was soon119 This curious name refers to the 5th Lagrangian Point along the Moon’s orbit.A space colony positioned there would remainpermanently gravitationally balanced between the Earth and the Moon.120 I was, of course, a founding member of L5.121 Blows Against the Empire quickly attained Gold Record status, and was thefirst rock album to be nominated for science-fiction’s prestigious Hugo Award.- 143 -revised into a prequel/sequel series and aggressively publicized as such. Theoriginal movie was retitled “EpisodeIV: A New Hope” of an intended 12-part sequence.Two sequels followed: #V: The Empire Strikes Back and #VI: Return of the Jedi.Next to come were threeprequels, after which Lucasfilm was acquired by the Walt Disney Company and afourth sequel, #VII: The ForceAwakens, was produced. Clearly the Star Wars culture has settled in to stay.As much as I admired the 1977 movie, I was unhappily unenthused by its twosequels:The Empire Strikes Back degraded the three principal characters - Luke, Han, andLeia - into a tawdry soap-opera love triangle, turned Darth Vader into a mindless slave, contradicted StarWars concerning Luke’s parentage,awkwardly added the required racial minority presence conspicuously absent fromthe first movie [unless you countDarth Vader’s voice], and served up a preposterous “Jedi initiation” for Lukepresided over by a green gnome bettersuited to Sesame Street.The Freudian omelet of TESB gave way to comic-book slapstick in Return of theJedi, wherein the lastremaining vestiges of the original Star Wars atmosphere were submerged beneath amotley parade of absurd aliensand panda-bear Ewoks, and dealt a terminal blow by the grotesque “Darth VaderBorn-Again” finale.As for the second series of Lucasfilms - Episodes I/II/III - for me theydeparted so far from the original firstmovie that I have no interest in them whatever.Here I hasten to caveat that I seem quite alone in my disillusionment: All ofthe official pre/sequels have beenspectacular box-office successes. My mistake, I suspect, was in reading a depthinto that first movie which it wasnever intended to incorporate. For this I can only apologize to George Lucas formy petulance.Which brings me to the outré history of FireForce.Back in 1977 I found myself somewhat dissatisfied with the way in which StarWars had developed thecharacter of Darth Vader and the notion of the Force.Darth Vader clearly made the story. As a magician with a purpose entirely beyondmere power-politics, he gavethe conflict a transcendental importance. It was not a war between a socialestablishment and a guerrilla movement;it was a contest between the Forms of what humans vaguely sense as “good” and“evil”.The “good” side (Leia and the Rebels) ostensibly represented egalitarianprinciples of government, symbiosiswith the natural environment of the universe, and tolerance for individualpersonality quirks as long as thecollective security of the Rebel band was not jeopardized.The “bad” side (Darth Vader and the Empire) represented authoritariangovernment, the manipulation of thenatural environment, division of beings into masterminds and workers, andintolerance of non-conformity.And the moral of Star Wars was that the “good” side should and would triumphover the “bad” - and that itsideology gave it the absolute right to do so, above and beyond purely politicalconsiderations. 122Why was Darth Vader so fascinating? [Why are all of history’s and fiction’sDarth Vaders so fascinating?]The answer is that he represents the Principle (or Platonic Form) ofintellectual separateness fromthe inertia of the universe.While the Rebels in the film seemed to be fighting for the cause ofindividuality, in fact they were doing so in anemotional, reactive sense - as an animal might struggle to escape from a trap.The real individualist was DarthVader, who determined to bend the Force to his purposes rather than todis-integrate his will and surrender it to theinertia of the Force [as Kenobi advised Luke to do].Conscious distinction from the natural order is a frightening notion to humans;hence they define it as “evil”and conjure up Satans to personify it in mythology. But, because their mindscontain elements of independencewhether they like it or not, they find “evil” alluring. And so Darth Vaderbecame an anti-hero.Darth Vaders can be destroyed only by greater Darth Vaders, or by accident. Thiswas illustrated inLord of the Rings, wherein a direct challenge to Sauron by Gandalf or Galadrielwould have resulted merely in his/her replacing him. The Saruman sub-plot explored this hypothesis. It wasnecessary for Sauron to be destroyed “byaccident”.But then Middle-earth became more primitive and less magical, because a highlevel of intellectual separatenessfrom nature had given way to a lower one. Who cares what happened inMiddle-earth after Sauron? No one; weknow it was bound to be dull.Star Wars dutifully echoed LOTR here. Responsibility for the overthrow of theDark Lord was taken by theForce; Luke simply surrendered to it at the opportune moment. His celebration inthe following awards ceremonywas “safe” because, like Frodo, he was a Common Man who had been brave andlucky. He would have beenunacceptable to audiences had he demanded Darth Vader’s prerogatives forhimself.In September 1977 I decided to explore these ideas by trying my hand at anamateur sequel - Secret of Sith(chapters “Mission to the Senate” through “The Secret of Seth”). I wrote it overa weekend and surprised Lilith bywriting her into it as well - in the character of Krel Atlan. I sent photocopiesto a few friends and put it out of mymind - until mid-1978, when Forrest J Ackerman asked me if he could include itin a special Darth Vader issue ofFamous Monsters of Filmland:122 As Peter Cowie relates in The Apocalypse Now Book, Francis Coppolaoriginally entrusted George Lucas with making his anti-Vietnam War movie while Coppola was busy with his Godfather series. Lucasagreed, but Coppola took it back when Lucas wasdelayed by American Graffiti. So Lucas relocated revolutionary Vietnam vs.America to outer space for his Rebels-vs.-Empiretheme.[index-144_1.png][index-144_2.png]- 144 -The Ackermonster’s introduction took it from there:Long, long ago ...In a galaxy far, far away ...In an alternate universe similar to but not identical to our own ...There lived a talented filmonster fan named Michael A. Aquino.And it came to pass that, for Lilith, the Lady of his Life, he told a tale toentertain her, giving no thoughtto a wider audience except that, since his story was an homage to Another GeorgeLucas in that parallelworld, he felt that the Great George also should have a copy.“Well, I have a few sci-fi friends too who might be interested,” he reasoned, soaltogether he ran off 30copies. Fortunately for the Editor of Famous Monsters (in that Other World) thisAquino, Historian ofEvents Imaginational, regarded EEEE (4E) as a friend and sent him a copy, saying“I recognize that I amnot a professional writer - you should look upon this as no more nor less thanfan fiction of the type thatfrequently appears in the Star Trek, Perry Rhodan & Dark Shadows fanzines - butnevertheless I thoughtyou might derive some fleeting entertainment from my little offering.”The Other Forry Ackerman (Forrest C. Ackerman was his full name rather thanForrest J) did enjoy thepseudo-history, so much so that he dispatched his copy via time-warpspace-o-gram to our present day solarsystem, Planet 3, Hollyweird, Karloffornia, and I read it with great interestand said to myself, “Why, this ismuch too unusual an item to simply let languish in limbo like Stuart J. Byrne’sTarzan on Mars,” so I ampresenting it here as a curiosity from which I believe you will derive anexciting reading experience.Bearing in mind that these events do not follow the path of George Lucas’history nor the late LeighBrackett’s nor any other authorized historians of Star Wars but are, as he putsit, “a personal fantasy” ofMichael Aquino’s, read on!Letters began to arrive from people all over the world telling me how they hadenjoyed the story. So I followedup S.O.S. with Pantechnikon (Chapters “Crossroads” through “End of theRebellion”), dedicated to Forry Ackermanand presented to him on New Year’s Day 1979.Scheduled to follow Pantechnikon in 1980 was Xronos, a titanic “ultimateconflict” set in not one but twogalaxies.[index-145_1.png][index-145_2.png]- 145 -The mathematics, research and writing filled bank after bank of my hardworkingPolyMorphic 8813 computer,Glinda, and Xronos became such a horrendous mass of data that meeting theanticipated date was impossible. [Youtry working with two galaxies sometime!]Four initial chapters from Xronos appeared in the 1981 compilation, thenwithdrawn in 1988 for furtherrevision. In 2002 I updated and re-included them and added an epilogicalsynopsis to them.Also added was an appendix concerning music - which, because of the obsolescenceof some of the originalrecorded media, may be more frustrating than helpful to the reader. Still Ithought it might be of some lingering“archæological” interest.As I became more and more deeply enmired in Xronos, I found that knowledge ofAndromeda’s more ancienthistory was necessary; hence Glinda and I assembled the chronology preceding theevents of Star Wars, graduallyexpanding to to semi-text as it approaches the story proper.Eventually and inevitably this left me with the “missing link” of the Star Warsmovie events themselves. My“explorations” were now so complex that without this lynchpin they would beunintelligible; yet they had changedthe scenario so markedly that assuming a reader’s familiarity with the movie wasno longer adequate.So it was necessary to retell the events of Star Wars, but incorporating themany changes and nuances whichFireForce necessitated. The result (chapters “The Rebellion Revealed” and “TheBattle of Garvin-5”) is superficiallysimilar to the original movie, but actually departs from it in almost everydetail. Mindful of both the responsibilitiesand limitations of parody, I attempted to pay tribute to the plot of theoriginal film while recontextualizing itsdetails. The result is “the same but different”.In the tradition of the original Star Wars film, FireForce is not really anovel, but rather a “movie set to prose”.The reader is intended to experience it, not just read it - as I experienced itwhen recording it. For I did not“author” it; rather I “observed the events taking place and then recorded what Isaw”.Similarly I did not “create” the characters. As each of them entered into thestory, I merely watched what he orshe did in various situations and then recorded those actions. As I spent moreand more time with the characters, Igrew to know them very well, and today count several of them as closeacquaintances. [Perhaps you will too.]As FireForce is a “movie in text”, I “cast” it with professional actors andactresses as well. It is an advantage ofmagic that one can not only take one’s pick of casting, but can move variouspersonages backward or forward intime/age to the precise appearance, age, and manner desired. Thus the dramatispersonæ for FireForce:I have retained five of the original actors of their age and appearance in theoriginal Star Wars film: MarkHamill as Lark Windancer, Harrison Ford as Jon Valo, Sir Alec Guinness as KenbiOdwan, Carrie Fisher as LoraOzana, and Peter Cushing as Doff Zarkin.In FireForce the role of Princess Lora is played by Carrie Fisher specificallyin the graceful, regal style sheadopted for the third Lucas film movie Return of the Jedi - absent the abrasivemannerisms she employed in StarWars or The Empire Strikes Back.How does a young woman behave under the responsibilities of sovereign royalty?Here I took for my model afairy Princess whom I met in my own childhood: Ozma of Oz:[index-146_1.jpg][index-146_2.jpg][index-146_3.jpg][index-146_4.jpg]- 146 -[Methinks I saw more than a hint of her in the way that the Star Wars Leia wasdressed and coiffed.] Like Lora,Ozma regularly confronted weird and fantastic perils, aided by creatures whowere at least as bizarre as some ofthose appearing in this history. Despite such trying circumstances she wasalways able to maintain her poise anddignity. And if Lora occasionally behaves a bit more like Dorothy Gale thanOzma, let us recall that Dorothy oftenjumped in to solve problems which at least temporarily would have dismayed herfairy friend.A second “study” for Lora was Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was similarlycatapulted into the turmoil ofsovereignty at a young age and forced to use her wits not just to become acapable ruler but also to survive theintrigues swirling around her.Deth Razor is portrayed by James Mason of the age, appearance, and manner hepresented as Captain Nemo inWalt Disney’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea:This is all the more important because during much of FireForce he appears freeof his protective armor. [And ifyou think you detect the ghost of the Nautilus in the Seth Starship, well …you’re right!]In George Lucas’ original Star Wars novel, the galactic emperor was a senator ofthe “old republic” by the nameof Palpatine who had seized power by means of a coup. In the second and thirdLucas films, however, the emperorwas turned into an ugly, malevolent sorcerer.Not so in FireForce. My Palatine is portrayed by Sir Laurence Olivier of theage, appearance, and patriciandemeanor he presented as Crassus in the film Spartacus - an analogy all the moreappropriate because of Crassus’military venture against Spartacus’ revolt at a time when the Roman Republic wastransitioning into the Empire:Imperial General Tharrud Terclis is modeled on [and his name is an anagram of]Colonel Richard L. Sutter, oneof the U.S. Army’s foremost authorities on Special Operations - and a longtimepersonal friend. Similarly Terclis’MindWar Center echoes the Army’s Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, NorthCarolina. Sutter kindly contributedTerclis’ speech to the graduating cadets of the MindWar Academy.In our FireForce film, Terclis is played by Yul Brynner of the age, appearance,and impossibly exquisitearrogance he presented as Pharaoh Rameses II in The Ten Commandments:[index-147_1.jpg][index-147_2.jpg][index-147_3.jpg][index-147_4.jpg][index-147_5.png][index-147_6.jpg]- 147 -Lorin Xanpol preincarnates Paul Lorin Kantner, creator of extraordinarilybeautiful hymns to space andmagic. 123.

The internal arrangement ofAndromeda is coincidentallyquite similar to that of your own Milky Way Galaxy, and in fact you may find itconvenient to use a map ofyour galaxy to better understand the Andromedan Star Wars.The entire galaxy is approximately one hundred thousand light-years in diameterand approximatelytwenty thousand light-years in breadth. It contains approximately one hundredthousand million starsystems. At the time of the Second Star War, the Galactic Empire extended alongsome thirty thousandlight-years of what would correspond to the Cygnus Carina arm of the galacticspiral, with its outermostcolonies located in what would correspond to the Beta Doradus spur of that arm.The Galactic Hub is located in Cygnus Carina in roughly the same location as theSol star system inyour galaxy. The planet Trantine is some four thousand eight hundred light-yearsdown the spiral armfrom the Hub, on the periphery of the arm towards the galactic nucleus. ThePlanet of Seth is located on theouter periphery of the Sagittarius arm, about three thousand six hundredlight-years down that arm froma star corresponding to your Iota-1 Scorpi. [It is the only location in theSecond Star War which is notlocated in the Cygnus Carina arm.]The aim of the Rebel forces in the Second Star War was not to conquer theGalactic Empire, but ratherto establish an independent territory for a new Republic. Thus they sought toisolate and control the BetaDoradus spur. The planet of Bralane is located in the approximate position ofyour Beta Doradus itself -about nine thousand six hundred light-years from the Hub, six thousandlight-years from Trantine, andeight thousand four hundred light-years from the Planet of Seth.The diameter of the Beta Doradus spur at the point where the Rebellion sought tocut it off from theEmpire is approximately 3,600 light-years. Across a 40-light-year band thatembraces some 333,000 starsystems. In Andromeda only about two percent of those systems are capable ofsupporting life, reducingthe number of contested systems to some 6,660 star systems. Even so one canappreciate the magnitude ofthe task the Rebellion set for itself - together with the difficulty the Empirefaced in trying to anticipate andcounter its specific operations.- 150 -Translite Velocity FlightAt the time you will be receiving this transmission, your own understanding ofvelocities will probablystill be based upon the misapprehension that faster-than-light travel isimpossible. Many years ago one ofour own academicians, a Professor Unistone, drew the same conclusion. He said inhis Special Theory ofRelativity that all velocities were relative except that of light, and itfollowed from this assumption thatmaterial objects could not accelerate past that velocity and remain material.The fallacy in Unistone’s Special Theory is that it postulates a similarcharacteristic (relative velocity)for everything in the universe except one thing (light). An exception to atheory invalidates the theory as ageneral law. A corrected Special Theory provides for relative velocities of allphenomena, light included.What makes the original Special Theory acceptable and even demonstrable is thatit does hold true forevidence of actual phenomena that is conveyed by light waves or slower media. Inother words, thedetectable results of experiments - including those which have supposedlyvalidated the original SpecialTheory - are conveyed to observers via sensory impressions which are functionsof wave emissions orreflections. As actual object velocities increase, our senses and those of testinstruments registerdistortions of mass and energy. But this is a distortion of the transmissionprocess and not of the actualobject. In the three-dimensional space in which it exists, it undergoes nomass/energy transformationwhatever (save, of course, loss of propulsion energy).Hence it is entirely possible for our starships to travel faster than light.Such a ship merely acceleratespast 186,000 mps (relative to its point of departure), and in the process ofdoing so it remains unchanged(to itself). To an observer standing on a platform against whose motion therelative 186,000 mps is beingmeasured, however, certain peculiar things would seem to happen:From the rear the ship would seem to undergo mass-conversion and then to vanishaltogether uponreaching relative light-speed, because the detectable emissions receding from ittowards the observerwould arrive at a slower and slower rate of speed and finally cease to comealtogether once the shipexceeds relative light-speed. At that moment the net direction of the emissionswould be away from theobserver ... in the same direction as the ship.Seen from the side, the ship’s image would undergo other distortions stemmingfrom the high lateralvelocity - again relative to the observer - of the emitted waves of energy. Andseen from the front, the ship’simage would also appear distorted, because the emitted waves would beapproaching the observer at morethan 186,000 mps.One of the implications of these facts is that the acceleration or decelerationof time, which follows fromthe original Special Theory, is also wrong. Time would appear to be distorted asthe emissions or reflectionsby which an observer on the ship or the platform measures the time of the otherobject became slower(receding) or faster (approaching). But again this would be a distortion of thetransmission process andnot of the objects themselves. On each object time would pass at the same rate.A spaceship traveling awayfrom your Sol-3 would seem to be populated by “slower” astronauts as seenthrough a Sol-3 telescope ortelevision. On its return trip it would seem to be populated by “faster”astronauts. Upon returning to Sol-3the astronauts would be found to have aged at precisely the same rate as theirterrestrial counterparts.Assuming relative velocity for light also means that a ship would neveraccelerate relative to a “fixed”light speed. Its acceleration past the speed of light could only be measuredagainst the relative velocities oflight-emissions from other objects - stars, orbiting planets, etc. Were astarship to exceed light-velocitytraveling away from your Sol-3, it would seem to a Sol-3 based observer tovanish. To an observer on theship, however, Sol-3 would appear to exceed light-speed and vanish.Once you understand the foregoing, you will also be able to resolve theapparently paradoxicalmathematics of “black holes” - which, in the Unistonian sense, do not exist.What your astronomers andphysicists have identified as “black holes” are in fact ordinary neutron stars.The ion-engine starships used by both the Rebellion and the Empire weregenerally capable of cruisingvelocities of 101,000 times the speed of light. Representative travel-timeswould thus be approximately amonth of your time between Trantine, the Planet of Seth, and the Hub [which arelocated in a roughequilateral triangle]. From the Planet of Seth to Bralane takes about sevenweeks, while a trip fromTrantine to Bralane takes only three weeks. Because of the curvature of the BetaDoradus spur, it tookGeneral Terclis’ forces from four to six weeks to reach their respective initialpositions in the Second StarWar. Terclis’ Kill Star reached its own initial position approximately fourweeks after leaving the Hub.[These time factors are all incorporated into the events of this history, ofcourse.]- 151 -Translite Channels (TLC)Because of a translite starship’s inability to take coherent readings of objectsof mass whose relativevelocity compared to it is greater than that of light, it is essentially “blind”once it achieves translitevelocity. The risk of collision with objects of mass became a real danger totranslite ships for this reason.Despite the vastness of space, a ship traveling at several hundred thousandtimes the speed of light runsthe risk of encountering various particles in its path. And striking even asingle small meteorite at thatrelative velocity would mean instantaneous destruction for the ship and itscrew.In order to achieve safe translite travel throughout the Galactic Empire inAndromeda, therefore, wedeveloped a network of “Translite Channels (TLC)” - essentially longvector-paths through space that werekept free of matter by stringent computer monitoring and destruction of objectswhich might intrude intothe channel. Translite travel outside of these channels was too dangerous to bepractical, with theexception of long-range probe ships equipped with AMPs.Anti-Matter Projectors (AMP)Anti-matter projectors (AMP) are devices designed to emit harmonious streams ofpositrons andantiprotons through the bombardment of matter by proton beams energized at alevel of several billionelectron-volts. When the antimatter particles are accelerated viaelectro-magnetic coils, they combine withand annihilate particles of matter in their path, producing zero mass and agreat deal of radiation. [Theprocess of annihilation releases energy many hundred times greater than thatcaused by a matter-fusionbomb of similar weight - for instance, your hydrogen bombs.]Small AMPs were therefore mounted on the noses of our explorer and courier shipsto enable them totravel at translite outside of the regular translite channels. In effect the AMPcreated a continuous matter-antimatter neutralization in front of the ship, obliterating any objects withwhich it might collide. Due tothe potential danger to life-forms which might lie in the path of AMP-equippedships, however, use of thedevices was kept to a necessary minimum.The large AMP mounted on the Kill Stars operated on the same principle. Themassive stream ofantimatter particles emitted from the projector simply combined with andobliterated the mattercomposing the target planet or fleet of ships.LasersOur large, triangular Class-13 TriDestroyers and the small twin-ion-engine (2IE)fighters are equippedwith CO2 gas-dynamic lasers, as was Jon Valo’s Nebula Eagle. Lasers are not usedin space just becausethey are more exotic or more colorful. [Indeed, science-fiction filmsnotwithstanding, one cannot seeflashes of laser-light in space, as there is no reflective atmosphere for thebeams to impact.] Lasers areused for two reasons: (1) Slower weapons are virtually useless against101,000xlite starships, and (2)weapons with any recoil whatever are highly impractical in a zero-gravityenvironment.The targeting of lasers at or from starships moving at translite velocities isextremely difficult; hencethey are used effectively only in battles where all opponents are moving atsublite velocity.GrasersCL-13s, Kill Stars, and major planetary defense bases are equipped with larger,more expensive, andmore cumbersome gamma-ray lasers (“grasers”). Grasers work on the same principleas lasers butsynchronize gamma rays from atomic nucleii rather than X-rays from the outsideelectrons. A graser-beam is, in essence, a synchronized nuclear explosion. The range and destructivepower of a graser is fargreater than that of a laser, but the massive containing and mirroring apparatusprecludes the use ofgrasers by individuals or indeed all but the largest of starships. Grasers arealso useless for wounding orincapacitating combat; a graser hit is invariably totally destructive.Photon EnginesThese are the most powerful engines known to our physicists. As of this writingonly two starships havebeen equipped with them - Lord Deth Razor’s starship and Lord Jon Valo’s NebulaEagle II. Both shipscarry two PEX-4C photon engines, although the Eagle also carries five K-80 ionengines as well.- 152 -The photon is a particle of zero mass caused by the combination of atoms ofmatter and antimatter andaccompanied by an explosive power hundreds of times more powerful than that ofhydrogen bomb fusion.Thus the engine is a propulsion application of the AMP-principle. Whereas ourIE-powered ships have aneffective cruising velocity of 101,000xlite, the two PEX-4C powered ships have atheoretical velocity of2,000,000xlite. Such speeds are only possible via the use of bow-AMPs on bothships; otherwise even theextremely rarified interstellar plasma would be deadly.Tactical ConsiderationsAcross the vast distances of space involved in the Second Star War [to saynothing of the Third], therewas no question of constructing “nets” or “barriers” of any sort. A force oneither side would easily be ableto avoid conflict; in fact both sides had to make a concentrated effort tolocate one another. The expertise ofa military commander, therefore, lies in first finding and then accuratelyassessing the size and strikingpower of an enemy force. Students of military history may compare LarkWindancer’s plan for defeatingthe second Kill Star with that of Robert E. Lee on the final day of the Battleof Gettysburg [see in particularMichael Shaara’s The Killer Angels, as well as the Cold War-era Warsaw Pact’s“breakthrough” doctrine forthe piercing of defensive lines via a phased-echelon attack.]Release of further technical information at this time would inhibit your normalprocess of scientificdevelopment.Raj DakkarRAJ DAKKARGeneral, STFChief of StaffRD:g:m- 153 -A10: Setamorphosis- by Michael A. Aquino V°South Solstice X/1975Setamorphosis: A TS term for the third stage of human evolution. The word isformed from Set-a orSet-heh (“Eternal Set” or “Timeless Set”), a god-form of Set in ancient Egypt asa serpent. Serpents weresymbolic of immortality via their seeming rebirth by shedding of their skin,were sacred to Set, and as theUræus symbolized the divine authority of the Pharaoh. They also representedimparted knowledge of adivine character; hence the later corruption that would appear in the “Garden ofEden” myth. The suffixdenotes a “change of form” or “transformation”. The familiar “metamorphosis”thus translates to“super(natural) transformation”. The old term is thus refined.“Genesis III” was an attempt to explain our present state of being in accordancewith the Book of ComingForth by Night and common sense. It was not intended to be a “last word” butrather a working hypothesis. I am farmore comfortable with hypotheses than with “laws”, because the formulation of alaw implies that all pertinentfactors have been taken into account. This in turn implies that all pertinentfactors are themselves completelyunderstood, and thus the factors that bear upon them, ad infinitum. Historicallyit is borne out that humanknowledge constantly increases, and there is no reason to assume that we nowknow all there is to know aboutanything! In point of fact, we don’t know the extent of what we don’t know.We obtain knowledge by interpolation and by projection . Interpolation inreasoning is also known asdeductive logic; projection as inductive logic . [For a review of the concept oflogic -and errors to avoid -see my“Much Ado About Logic” in Cloven Hoof #IV-2.] The most general shortcoming ofboth systems ofknowledge acquisition is that they work only with known data. New theories incomplete accord withknown data may in fact be quite [or partially] wrong, but this cannot bediscovered until the theory bumps into freshdata which does not fit the mold.I go into this for two reasons. The first is that we must never allow the Templeof Set to relax into fixedconcepts. The key to the ultimate success of the Temple is Xeper in itsintellectual pursuits as well as in its Initiates.The second reason is that, in the course of this communiqué, I will be clashinghead-on with a gentleman by thename of Einstein. He himself was forethinking enough to define his discoveriesas “theories”, but their dazzlingnature has tended to enshrine them as de facto laws, questioned at dire peril.What they explain, they explain well.The danger lies in projecting them too far beyond the known phenomena by whichthey were first interpolated.Consider this well.By its very design the Temple confronts two essential problems. The secondproblem is to identify,comprehend, and effect Setamorphosis. Solving this problem promises to beexciting, stimulating, and ultimatelyvery rewarding. The first problem is to survive long enough to solve the secondproblem. And this task,unfortunately, may be tedious, depressing, and possibly dangerous.Consider the following passage from the Book of Coming Forth by Night:I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilationwhich none but theElect may hope to avoid. And alone I cannot preserve my Elect, but I would teachthem and strengthen theirWill against the coming peril, that they and their blood may endure. To do thisI must give further of myown Essence to my Elect, and, should they fail, the Majesty of Set shall fadeand be ended.When I first read this passage, I was inclined to interpret it as a reference tothe general ecological crisis thatthe human race as a whole faces in the next 50-100 years per the research of theClub of Rome, Jacques-YvesCousteau, and other Temple contacts. Stated in its most basic form, this crisiscomprises the outrunning of Earth'slife-support systems by a humanity that is reproducing itself out of control.The Club of Rome assumes [in TheLimits to Growth and Mankind at the Turning-Point] that world order will breakdown in frantic competition foravailable resources, resulting in a great deal of initial carnage (25%+ of theworld population) and then a new era ofrepressive, primitive feudalism. More pessimistic predictions see theintroduction of massive thermonuclearweaponry during the crisis period, with the resultant extermination of all lifeon Earth.There were two things that bothered me about this initial interpretation of thepassage. One was that such anecological crisis would occur on such a tremendous scope that its sheer inertiawould prevail against anything evenan enlarged and strengthened Temple of Set could do to prevent it. The other wasthat any sort of “escape” by theElect seems highly improbable. In spite of the wistfulness with which romanticsgrope towards a new Exodus tospace [consider the strong emotional appeal of Star Trek and Space: 1999 in thislight], a colonial-scale space effortis all but ruled out by the increasing demand for resources to be diverted tothe growing Earth-crisis itself. And evenif some neo-Noah’s ark were planned, selection of the privileged few would bequite impossible. [Most likely theproject would be destroyed by the disappointed majority; shades of Pythagorasand his rejected “deficientintellectuals”!]- 154 -The passage does not say “escape”, however; it says “avoid”. This raises thepossibility of the Temple of Setsurviving during the crisis and aftermath period in spite of the fact that itcontinues to be located on this planet. Inthe event of a nuclear holocaust, of course, nothing of the sort would bepossible. But I am inclined to think that thecrisis will attain full force in a more gradual way, resulting in increasinganarchy and then a violent authoritarianbacklash. The final scenario would be one of the world divided into a number ofcrude police-states, with anintellectual atmosphere something like that in 1984. There have been countlessexamples of this political/socialpattern throughout history, the most recent being the current century’s fascistregimes in Germany, Italy, Japan,South America, and Africa. Indeed the trend towards authoritarian government isincreasing right now while wewatch, as democratic/republican systems prove more and more incapable of copingwith growing pre-crisis stresses.This past summer I discussed this situation with the Executive Director at ameeting in San Francisco. I thenbrought up the concept that Isaac Asimov had introduced in his famousscience-fiction trilogy Foundation/Foundation and Empire/Second Foundation.In this novel a psychohistorian (one who calculates the probable course of thefuture based uponinterpolation and projection of past social patterns and human psychology)predicts the gradual decline and fallof the galactic empire and a subsequent era of feudal anarchy. In order topreserve the sum of accumulatedknowledge throughout this period, he institutes a Foundation of scientists andtechnologists on a remote planet atthe edge of the galactic spiral. Through its technological skill and relativeisolation from the mainstream of therevolutions and wars, the Foundation survives the disintegration of the empireand even establishes a certainhegemony of its own. But, through a freak accident, the Foundation is almostconquered by a mental mutant. It issaved through psychohistorical manipulation by a Second Foundation, secretlyinstituted and maintained in theheart of the old empire by the original psychohistorian. The Second Foundationthen feigns its own destruction,allowing the First Foundation to continue on its way without feeling threatened.What I call the “Star Trek syndrome” is a desire to emulate the First Foundationby getting the hell off theplanet with a small group of technological elite. For reasons cited earlier,this course of action is not open to theTemple [or anyone else]. But it may well prove possible for an organization withthe unique characteristics of theTemple to emulate the Second Foundation. Consider:The Second Foundation survived secretly because its avowed purpose - caretakingof the main library of theold empire - was thought unimportant and irrelevant to the warring factions. Itsactual configuration as a team ofpsychohistorians was unknown, even to the First Foundation.The Temple of Set to the public is a quaint peculiarity - a group of religiousnuts who worship some oldEgyptian god. Hence it is not a likely target of authoritarian repression. Ifanything, association with the Templewould tend to gain one a public reputation as an antiquarian eccentric,therefore politically harmless. That theTemple is Coming Into Being as an extraordinarily sophisticated organizationdoes not become apparent until onehas joined and advanced to the III°+ level. Such is the Election of thePriesthood of Set that it would be impossiblefor an unqualified person to attain such recognition. [This is just as well,because I would not envy the fate of a falsePriest of Set.]The prospect of a secret society existing in the midst of a secular culture isnot a novel one. Case studies maybe drawn from the Templars, Rosicrucians, Illuminati, Golden Dawn, A.'.A.'.,Church of Satan, etc. The approachhas been successful to the extent that it has been either strictly secret orphilosophically camouflaged. In moderntimes, strict secrecy is no longer possible [even for the high-echelon units ofgovernment]. Moreover the sort oforganizational structure necessary to enforce strict secrecy would make theTemple an increasingly threateningentity in the eyes of authoritarian governments.Let us look more closely at the notion of “philosophical camouflage”. The ideahere is to develop a vocabularyand philosophical frame of reference which are useful for conveying the mostsophisticated information betweenInitiates, but which merely seem nonsensical and ridiculous to the non-initiate.This is not the same thing as a cipher per se, which is a code that anyone giventhe key can read.Philosophical camouflage is unbreakable when expertly used, and in its mostadvanced form it cannot even beexplained to an interrogator. This is because the concepts and relationshipswhich comprise the linguistic systemmust all be communicated and understood before the system as a whole makes anysense. And those concepts andrelationships each require a Setian mind for understanding. Thus this entiresystem possesses its own “failsafe”device.Should you attend a convention of technologists in some field other thanyour own, you will quickly discoverthat many terms unfamiliar to you are being used casually. Such terms are bothprofessional jargon and precisetechnological concepts. One must be an “initiate” (educationally and/orprofessionally) to understand theconversation. The Temple is in a position to adapt this phenomenon to our ownpurposes, which encompass magic,futurist analysis, and our own brand of Asimov’s psychohistory.Because of the special position of religion in both society and the humanpsyche, the Temple can expectrelative tolerance and freedom of internal action during at least the earlierstages of authoritarian social systems.[By strict definition, authoritarian systems require only behavioralcooperation. Totalitarian systems requiremental and philosophical endorsement as well. Thus it is when things reach thetotalitarian stage that churches andinitiatory societies come under fire. Examples: Stalinist Russia & NaziGermany.]Because of the absence of strong social dogmas in bringing about or controllingthe ecological crisis, I suspectat this time that repressive measures will not come to the totalitarian extreme.The Temple should therefore be able- 155 -to maintain its own “religious eccentricity” without overt attention orpersecution. To the extent that ourphilosophical camouflage is successful, we will be able to enjoy internalfreedom to pursue the Second Problem.Externally our Initiates will be able to participate pragmatically in whateversocial systems they find themselveslocated.The profile and survival techniques of the Second Foundation within thedecaying, authoritarian galacticempire were not described in any detail. Nor did the Second Foundation possessor feign religious philosophies perse.A very interesting blueprint for the manner in which religious philosophicalcamouflage may be used in anauthoritarian system exists in a book which the Executive Director sent to me ashort time after our conference. It isRobert A. Heinlein’s The Day After Tomorrow. In this novel religious conceptsare deliberately used as political andsocial weapons against an oppressive government, the concepts themselves beingonly a sham. In the Temple, bycontrast, our concepts are quite genuine. But the way in which a religiousstructure may defend itself against socialrepression with the aid of its intrinsic concepts is well illustrated here.After reading the Asimov and Heinlein works, you may find it interesting toreview the way in which theCatholic Church survived [and even prospered] during the medieval era. Specialattention should be given to themethods and achievements of Pope Innocent III [see especially Sidney Packard’sEurope and the Church underInnocent III (NY: Russell Russell, 1967)]. While Catholic and Setianphilosophies hardly coincide, we may learnsome valuable lessons from the experiences of the medieval religiousinstitutions.What form will the philosophical camouflage of the Temple assume? It is not aquestion which can beanswered a priori. We will develop it as we go along. My guess is that it willdraw strongly from the magical/religious/philosophical camouflage employed both widely and expertly by AleisterCrowley and John Dee. You arealready familiar with some good source material on the former, so let's take aquick look at the latter.John Dee lived from 1527 to 1608 CE. During his lifetime he became an expertmathematician, geographer[studying under Mercator], and astronomer. He was intimately familiar with thework of Pythagoras, Plato, andAristotle. He was sufficiently accomplished in chemistry to scorn the illogic ofalchemy, and his official position asastrologer to Elizabeth I was largely a blind for extensive politicalintelligence work on her behalf. Because of histhorough familiarity with esoterica, Dee could phrase both his intelligencereports and his own experimental records& diaries in a fashion almost completely indecipherable by others. An examplemay be found in one of Dee’s 1585reports to Elizabeth:At the time, Dee was in Prague. A fellow occultist told him that a party ofFrenchmen financed by the Spanishcrown were being sent to England to sabotage the English shipbuilding program.The only clue available to Dee wasthat the party was instructed to arrive “before three yeares were ended and thenine men beginne theirPerambulation”. He sent the following “record of a magical conversation with thespirit Madimi” to Elizabeth:Ma. \"I am a poor little maiden, Madimi, but I rejoyce in the name of Jesus.\"D.“What is it that you can see?”Ma. “I see the coming of the end of the three yeare circle and the approache ofthe Nine Guardians ofthe Vert.”D.“What does that portend?”Ma. “Here is something that maketh me afraid. I see the Bible and a stick ofhollie and the danger ofperjury by someone. It is a test of loyalty.”D.Madimi’s gown changed colour from red to green and she shook it as though theskirt was a treerustling in the wind. She went up and down with livelie gestures, dancing andpretending she wasa tree bent this way and that in the breeze, as though she performed a charade.D.“Whose man are you?”Ma. “I am the servant of God both by my bounden duty and by his Adoption. For methe truth issacred.”D.“What more do you see?”Ma. “I see the risk of fire, great fire.” Her dress changed colour to red again.D.“What is the significance of the three yeares and the Nine Men?”Ma. “The Nine are Guardians of the RF D. They must acte against fire by thecreatures of theScorpion. O.S.V.”D.“And the Nine must watch for the chimney of smoke?”Ma. “I must not guess the truth, but so it would seem. My sister has torn twoleaves from the bookwhich would have tolde me.”Dee’s familiarity with old Druidic customs had reminded him of one still inprogress. The Druids had held thenumber 3 and multiples thereof in special regard. The Druidic year was 360 days,and once every three years ninegovernment foresters made a circuit inspection of the royal forests. Crucial tothe current shipbuilding effort was theRoyal Forest of Dean, identified by both \"RF D\" and the reference to the Bible &stick of holly [used in that forest inanother Druidic custom]. The “Scorpion” was Dee’s code word for Spain, and theEnochian sequence O.S.V. [“I reignover you”] brought the message to Elizabeth’s attention. The “chimney” refers tothe customary right of forest- 156 -squatters to land on which they could build a chimney between sunset andsunrise. Elizabethan agents watched forand eventually discovered an attempt to bribe such squatters to burn the forest,and successfully thwarted same.The point here is threefold: (1) Dee’s freedom from suspicion and freedom ofaction as an “eccentricastrologer & occultist”, (2) his ability to put both Druidic lore and his ownsystems to practical use, and (3) thealmost complete indecipherability of a message incorporating philosophicalcamouflage except by a fellow initiate.The basic facts concerning Dee’s life are well-documented and fairly easy tofind. Not so his magical researchand philosophy. He left massive papers comprising diaries and records of magicalworkings, but they are heavilylaced with philosophical camouflage per the example just cited.The papers themselves are scattered between the British Museum, Oxford’sAshmolean Museum, privateContinental collections, and the Soviet Union. The papers acquired by Meric.Casaubon for Dr. John Dee’s ActionsWith Spirits are only a sample of Dee’s voluminous “angelic conversations”.Fortunately the Casaubon paperscontain the Enochian Keys, which may possess an entirely self-containedphilosophical camouflage system.Unfortunately the completeness of the Casaubon work is itself subject toquestion. Contemporary Deebiographer John Aubrey said: “Meredith Lloyd sayes that John Dee’s printed bookeof Spirits (i.e. the Casaubonbook) is not above the third part of what was writt, which were in Sir RobertCotton’s library; many whereof weremuch perished by being buryed, and Sir Robert Cotton bought the field to diggeafter it.”Arthur Dee, John’s son, wrote of the Casaubon book: “It did great harme to thememorie of a great man andwas both ignorant and mischievous.”Yet the published manuscripts seem to have been sufficiently intact to worryinsiders in the government. ABritish Museum copy of the Casaubon work contains a 1683 notation indicatingthat the government had consideredseizing all copies of the book, but that it had sold too quickly for effectiveaction to be taken.A crucial key to Dee’s philosophical camouflage may be found in a deciphering ofhis Hieroglyphic Monad,still undeciphered but significantly republished in the year 1975 by SamuelWeiser, Inc. My opinion is that the keysto the Monad and hence to the basis for the Enochian system will be found in thePythagorean/Platonic (i.e. neo-Egyptian) concepts to which Dee devoted such extensive research.[A note may be inserted here: The claim has been made that Enochian per sepredates Dee. This is completelyunsubstantiated and undocumented. Superficially Enochian is a jargon andpossesses no unique grammar or syntax.It can be written according to English, Hebraic, Latin, etc. grammar once onehas made a rough catalogue of itswords from the Casaubon text. This was done by Aleister Crowley and resulted inthe “Enochian” invocations heappended to his Goetia.]Philosophical camouflage alone will not solve our Problem #1. A variety of othertechniques and mechanismsmust be devised as well, among them an intra-Temple communications system thatdoes not rely on the mails [thevulnerability of which was just demonstrated to us by the Canadian mail strike].A diffusion of knowledge and source material throughout the Priesthood will makethe Temple that much lesssusceptible to impairment through the loss or incapacitation of one or moreofficials. A flexible administrativestructure will keep us “light on our feet” and able to plan for and react tochanges in the social environment.All these projects are already off the ground. For example, in-depth researchinto Enochian is being done byMagister Ethel and Priest Holt. Intra-Temple communication systems for thefuture are being studied by theExecutive Director and Magister Grumboski. Selective diffusion of Templeconcepts is being handled by MagistraWendall via the Scroll, and on a lesser scale by periodic newsletters &communiqués from a number of officials. Anexploration of the potential use of our nonprofit corporate administrativestructure is being undertaken by MagisterSeago. Altogether this constitutes an important first step in a continuous andcumulative process.Now let me address Problem #2 and work over Mr. Einstein. [In fact I won’t doanything to him that I didn'tdo to Darwin in Genesis III; you can draw your own conclusions!]The solution to Problem #1 can be only a temporary one, no matter how long wemay be able to string it out.Even if the Temple succeeds in preserving an internal freedom of operationamidst an authoritarian politicalenvironment, the natural resources that enable scientific research to functionat a high level of priority areuncomfortably finite. Scientifically-assisted breakthroughs must be effectedbefore human standards of living [andhence funds resources for educational scientific research] are lowered.The problem with Setamorphosis is that we don’t know what form it will take, how[if at all] we may influenceit, what scale it will occur on, or when it will be effected.Yet the passage of the Book of Coming Forth by Night cited above does notlicense the Elect to sit on theirhaunches and await the arrival of a good fairy with a sackful of ruby slippers.Rather the implication is that the germof Setamorphosis already exists within those who are recognized as Elect, andthat they must isolate it and developit. [Here you may find it helpful to consult selected works of Colin Wilson,especially The Philosopher’s Stone andThe Mind Parasites.]Unless it transpires that Setamorphosis will involve an Elect so numerous thatit can control Earth [along theline of Childhood’s End], or unless Setamorphosis itself enables the Elect tocontrol non-Elect, Earth will proceed tobecome increasingly inhospitable. Moreover there is more to the Star Treksyndrome than meets the eye: It isimpractical as a solution to Problem #1, but its strong psychological draw [of a“racial memory”-type] bears uponProblem #2.Merely building an Enterprise or two and larking off across the cosmos won’t cutthe mustard. Life-supportsystems would be finite and ultimately non-renewable. And the chances of findinga planet with precisely the right- 157 -chemical, organic, and environmental constitution to sustain human beings isinfinitesimal, particularly within theoperating lifetime of a sub-speed-of-light space vessel.So we confront two questions: (a) Is faster-than-light travel possible? and (b)If so, what would be theconsequences?According to Einstein’s second fundamental postulate of the Special Theory ofRelativity, the velocity of lightis always constant relative to an observer, no matter how fast the observer andthe light source are separating orconverging. A derived equation states that, when an object is moving withrespect to an observer, the mass of theobject becomes greater, the amount of increase depending on the relativevelocity of object and observer. At thesame time that the mass of the object increases, its length along the axis ofits direction will decrease. At the speed oflight, the object’s mass becomes infinite and its length shrinks to zero. Sincean “infinite-plus” amount of energywould be required to raise the speed of an infinite mass beyond the speed oflight, such hyper-light speed is notpossible.Mathematically the Special Theory is consistent, because it treats the speed oflight as a constant andincorporates a series of equations which rely upon that constant and areconsistent with one another. As the SpecialTheory applies to sub-lightspeed phenomena, it is correct. The interrelationshipof mass and energy relative to186,000 miles per second (the Einstein speed of light constant) has beenformulated as E=mc2 and put into practicethrough nuclear fission.The Achilles’ Heel of the Special Theory is that, while applying the principleof relativity to everything exceptthe speed of light, it treats the speed of light as an exception to the rule. Anexception to a rule of physics is anindication that the rule is inadequate to cover all known phenomena. (= AquinoAphorism) Einstein’sdecision to treat the speed of light as a constant was based upon the differencebetween the speed of light and non-light-wave-related phenomena being so vast as to make sub-186,000 light speedimpossible to detect; and also uponthe inability of science to detect anything going faster than 186,000 mps.Note my emphasis upon the word “detect”. Detection and existence are twodifferent things. Now consider thishypothesis: If light waves from a stationary source travel at 186,000 mps, andthose light waves are the only meansan observer located elsewhere has for detection of that source, what wouldhappen if the source begins to move awayfrom the observer at 186,001 mps? The light waves that are the sole source ofthe observer’s information are now nolonger reaching that observer. The waves are now receding from him at 1 mps. Asfar as the observer can detect, thelight-source vanished when its speed passed beyond the speed of light. But didit? It did not. It still exists, and aperson riding along with it would still exist as well.What about a light-source approaching at a speed faster than that of light?Following our line of reasoning, ititself would arrive before an observer could detect it, because we do notpossess the apparatus to detect emitted lighttraveling 186,001 mps. If it were to smash into us, we would literally not knowwhat hit us. If it were to s1ow downto sub-light speeds upon reaching us, light waves subsequently emitted wouldinform us of its presence. [Andpeople wonder how UFOs could ever get into the vicinity of Earth without beingdetected?]As an object passes an observer laterally and approaches the speed of light, itseems to compress. Theexplanation for this is more complex, but it can be approximated by saying thatthe lateral movement/oscillation ofthe emitted light waves is less detectable as the lateral speed of thelight-source approaches 186,000 mps.All this sums up to say that Einstein's Special Theory is valid for physicalphenomena at speeds so slow that186,000 mps might as well be a constant. It is not valid as an argument against+186,000 mps travel. In fact, itsprovisions for relative motion, when applied to the “sacred” 186,000 mps figure,invalidate any absolutemeasurement of that figure and hence destroy its significance.So much for the Special Theory. Faster-than-light travel is just as easy astraveling 186,000 mps. You just haveto wind the rubber band a little tighter, that's all. [If you want to presentthis case to your local physics teacher andhe still insists the world is flat, don’t blame me.]So the Temple has the option to build a faster-than-light Enterprise, and nospecial gymnastics are necessaryto produce “warp-factor” engines. Inertia in a vacuum and with negligiblegravitational drag will remain constant;the firing of additional rockets will constantly increase velocity, not maintainit. To travel increasingly faster thanlight, just bum the engines proportionately longer.That’s the minor problem. The major one, as cited above, is to find a closedenvironmental system (i.e. aplanet) capable of supporting human life without negative side-effects.Considering the painfully-long evolution ofeven the most basic organisms to produce complex forms capable of surviving onEarth, this is a task of dismayingdifficulty. It is not necessarily unsolvable, but additional chemical andbiological data must be assembled first. Sopro tem I will table it.Are there other options open to us besides a star trek? Quite possibly. In“Genesis II” (Cloven Hoof #IV-7) Iaddressed the concept of an antimatter universe to account for the existence ofa “positive” one according to theequation 0 = +1-1. There are two forms in which an antimatter universe couldexist. The first and more easilyconceivable form is that of stars & planetary bodies of antimatter co-located inthe “positive” space that hosts ourown solar system. Since space itself is merely a near-vacuum [containingextremely rarified (10-6 atoms/cc)plasma], there seems to be no necessity for a “second space”. [Antimatter isnecessary to logically explain theexistence of matter.]- 158 -Antimatter bodies in “normal” space would not appear markedly different frommatter bodies. They could bedetected only by the violence with which they would react to contact withmatter. Should an object of antimattercontact an object of matter, there would be an explosion releasing many hundredsof times more energy than ahydrogen bomb of the same mass. That such explosions have not been detected todate is not improbable, given thatthe universe is expanding.For a time it seemed to me that the existence of “Black Holes” argued for theirbeing a gate between the“normal” universe and an entirely distinct one.According to conventional theories, a Black Hole is a neutron star/“white dwarf”that continues to collapse inupon itself to a density where the ratio of gravity to surface area would be sostrong that escape velocity would haveto exceed the speed of light. Furthermore the strong gravity continues to“tighten” the mass of the Black Holecontinuously, resulting in an infinitely small concentration of the originalmass. Logic would indicate that theprocess would have to lead “somewhere” - perhaps into the “second” universe ofanti-material existence, where aproportionate expansion would take place. [The alternative to this - and theconventional Black Hole theory - is aninfinitesimal “point” of mass with the gravitational force of the original star... which would suck into itself any otherchunk of mass passing close enough.]Black Holes, however, are relatively unknown quantities. No sample Black Holewhich could not just as easilybe a neutron star has manifested itself. [If Black Holes are infinitesimalpoints, this is not surprising.] So BlackHoles remain theoretical. Nor would a Black Hole make a very comfortable gateinto a “second” universe, since atraveler would be processed into a zero-dimensional pancake en route. To theTemple of Set Black Holes - if andwhen their existence is verified - will be significant only if they constituteproof that a “second” universe should infact exist.Setamorphosis from matter to antimatter in the normal universe wouldn’t seem toaccomplish anything. LikeAlice going through the looking-glass, we would merely become mirror-images ofourselves, unable to come intocontact with matter. Setamorphosis into a different universe “opposite” this onethrough a gate less uncomfortablethan a Black Hole might be somewhat more interesting.Acceleration past the speed of light will not in and of itself serve as any sortof a gate. [It might have, except forthe invalidation of the Special Theory of Relativity where the restriction on186,000+ mps speeds is concerned.]And the existence of Black Holes remains mathematically impossible, since azero-dimensional point cannot containeven an iota of mass, much less all that contained in a star.But, if a Black Hole phenomenon should prove to be a rupture into a “seconduniverse”, then we may find thatintense concentration of mass beyond a certain density forces such a rupture. Ifsuch a rupture can be madepassable to mass that has not itself undergone concentration, we’ve got ourgateway. States the Book of ComingForth by Night:HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and could achieve identity onlyby becoming whatthe Cosmic order was not. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a Void inwhich true Creation couldtake form as Set.- 159 -A11: Setamorphosis II- by Michael A. Aquino V°Vernal Equinox 1976Since I sent you the original Setamorphosis letter at the Winter Solstice of X,there has been quite a discussionabout the concept. The purpose of Setamorphosis II is to summarize some of thepoints that have been brought out,to introduce some refinements to the original concept, and to identifyadditional considerations that may meritdiscusion and research. I anticipate that Setamorphosis II will eventually befollowed by III, IV, V, etc. as theTemple of Set refines and systematizes the concept and components.Summary of Discussion & Actions to Date(1) From the Priesthood I have received no negative comments concerning theoverall tone or philosophy ofSetamorphosis. This is significant because the concept involves somepotentially-controversial assumptions andconclusions.The idea that Earth civilization is entering a period of over-saturation andcrisis, for example, is by no meansgenerally accepted by analysts and forecasters.The exclusivist and elitist tone of Setamorphosis might have raised someobjections from readers on groundsof compassion and humanitarianism.The technological, financial, and cooperative requirements raised might haveseemed ridiculous for anorganization that is presently just getting underway.Finally it is a “long mental stretch” between ancient Egypt, traditionalconcepts of magic, Satanism, andspaceships capable of faster-than-light/interdimensional travel! Some might havethought that the Temple wassimply biting off far more than it could ever hope to chew.(2) As it turned out, however, the comments I received from you were positive.You took the ball and ran withit. In individual letters you addressed various parts of the concept, suggestedcorrections & refinements, andbrought out considerations which the initial document did not raise. Youdiscussed the concept with each other, andwith selected I°/II° Initiates. Finally, through the Executive Director’soffice, a Department of Contingency Planning(DCP) was formed to coordinate a continuing study of the First Problem ofSetamorphosis.This is where we stand right now, and it is nothing short of phenomenal when oneconsiders that only fourmonths have elapsed since the Setamorphosis concept was introduced.(3) The question of communications was brought up almost immediately. Themembership of the Temple isspread out rather loosely across great geographic expanses. What will be ourprimary and alternate methods ofcommunication, both now and in the foreseeable future? Why? Do we have aprojected rate of organizationalexpansion that will affect this picture one way or another? What about expensesinvolved and skills required?(4) Exactly what is this “crisis” referred to in the Book of Coming Forth byNight? Is it something that can bepinned down, or is it simply a vague omen? Are we being unduly paranoid, or arewe being practical andresourceful? What is the rate of speed at which all this will happen?(5) What is the function of magic in Setamorphosis? Is it only a “blind” as JohnDee employed it, or does ithave substantive value?(6) How do these relatively independent and isolationist notions square with theTemple’s status as anorganization incorporated under the laws of a secular state? Are we thus notbound to support the state and tie ourfortunes to it?(7) Is the Temple having a bad case of Star Trek-itis? [Do the High Priest’sfamous pointed eyebrows meanthat he is also part Vulcan?] Is it true that Carpathia Forge is building astarship out in the Nevada desert? IfEinstein were wrong, how come Hiroshima got a crew cut? Leading to: How much ofall this is mere speculation,and how much of it is reliable fact?Department of Contingency PlanningThe DCP has an interesting history. Approximately one week after the appearanceof Setamorphosis, MagisterGrumboski sent an “eyes only” memorandum to the Executive Director, outliningsome of the strategic and logisticalimplications of the first problem.- 160 -This was followed on 2/5 with a letter from the Executive Director to PriestLynn Norton, asking him toorganize and coordinate a DCP. Finally on 3/13 Priest Norton sent out an initialdescriptive letter concerning theDCP to about ten Setians of various degrees who had expressed an interest inworking on the project.Included in the 3/13 letter were many of the logistical/strategic considerationsintroduced by Shai[Grumboski] and the Todal [Murray], as well as Norton’s own sketch of theconfiguration of the DCP.Interspersed with the serious points of the letter were some snatches of humor[i.e. “Martians may land inspace ships.”]. This caused an incident or two of treeclimbing by individualswho wondered if (a) we were becomingraving paranoiacs, or (b) we had reason to suspect that Martians actually wouldbe landing in space ships.So, before we go any further, let me emphasize a couple of points:The first is that the DCP [and the entireTemple, for that matter] is not a “finished product”. It is a workingproposition which will be refined and elaborated upon as it gets underway. Sothere is no reason for anyone to climba tree just because he sees a phrase or two in print that startles him. Thesethings will all work themselves out as ourknowledge and capabilities grow.The important thing is that no one “suffer in silence”. If you have a comment oran idea - pro or con - let’s hearit. That is Xeper.Another point is that a magician without a sense of humor might as well hang itup. We will be dealing withproblems and situations that will be both serious and depressing. In spite ofthis we need to maintain optimism,creativity, and imagination. The ability to smile - indeed to poke fun atourselves on occasion - is important. Itprevents us from taking ourselves too dogmatically [which would result in a“freezing” of opinions]. It enables us toserve as our own worst critics, which is important to the maintenance of a senseof perspective. It allows criticism oftheories without ego-insult to their authors. Finally it is a “safety-valve” torelease tensions between individualswithout harm to them or to the Temple. If there is a subject which you cannot“stand” seeing lampooned orcaricatured, it is a sign that your philosophy is becoming rigidified in thatarea. Think about it.A final point relative to DCP is that any sort of projection for the future isbound to be vague. Frankly we don’tknow what’s actually going to happen until it does. In the meantime we are facedwith a rather simple choice: Planfor the worst and be pleasantly surprised if it doesn’t occur; or plan for thebest and be unpleasantly surprised if itdoesn’t occur.As the future develops, and as our own expertise in estimating it increases,we’ll be more and more able toposition ourselves at a practical medium between the two extremes. But we haveto get our feet wet first, and theDCP is a first move towards doing just that.The DCP is not intended to be the only part of the Temple that is concerned withthe First Problem. We are allconcerned with it. But the DCP is in a position to be a collecting andcoordinating agency for the project. As youhave comments and ideas that impact upon it, please send them along to PriestNorton. And, of course, if you arenot now involved with the DCP and would like to work with it, let him know thatas well.CommunicationsThe Executive Director has asked Priest Ronald Barrett of San Francisco to rideherd on this item.What it boils down to is this: At the present time the Temple is orientedtowards written communications viathe mail, and towards verbal communications via face-to-face meetings and thetelephone. Our communicationssystems affect what we say, the speed with which we can react to it, and thepatterns in which the organization willexpand.If in fact one or more of our present communications systems should break downor prove unreliable, theTemple would be hamstrung to a certain extent. [During the recent Canadian mailstrike, for example,communications with our Canadian members came to an abrupt standstill. TheExecutive Director was able toarrange certain key lines of communication via diplomatic channels, but you seethe general point.]Under ideal circumstances, obviously, our present orientation is the best. Themails are cheap & quick, andphotocopy & offset machines permit quick & economical duplication of data.Perhaps the mails will continue to bereliable; perhaps not. The point is not to get caught with our pants down if thepostal system becomes unusable,that’s all.Barrett is presently investigating radio as an interesting alternative. It hasboth advantages and disadvantages,of course. But it is conceivable that the Temple could work out a contingencycommunications system based uponHAM radio between nations, states, cities; and upon Citizen’s Band AM/SSB radiowithin local areas. This is justone of many alternatives for us to think about.But, as with DCP, we have to consider such things in advance of an actualcrisis. There wouldn't have beenmuch point in Noah starting to build the ark once the rain began to fall, right?Communications FundingThis only becomes a really major problem if we are talking in terms of radio. Ido not foresee the Templeacquiring any CB equipment; that is an individual concern. It is possible - notnecessarily probable -that we mightwant to own and operate HAM equipment on an organizational basis. But this is along-range consideration whichwe should not worry about until the entire subject has been discussed anddeveloped a good deal more.- 161 -Nature of “The Crisis”The Book of Coming Forth by Night is not clear about this. As a rule of thumb, Iam inclined to consider it areference to the general socio-econopolitical deterioration that the Club ofRome et al. project for the next half-century or so. [For details, consult Mankind at the Turning Point on the TempleReading List.]I do not think that the crisis is going to be short-range or of instantaneousimpact [such as nuclear war or acoup d’etat]. Particularly while we are a young organization, there is no way wecan plan for or react against short-range developments. But we can anticipate, plan for, and surmount long-rangescenarios. Our exclusively-internalorientation, our lack of red tape, our forecasting machinery, our contingencyplans, and our sensitivity as the Electof Set are all very real advantages which we possess and others do not.What is the function of magic in this?In the nine months since the advent of the new Æon, it has become clear thatmany preexisting notions ofmagic were inefficient if not outright nonsensical. I will be issuing Priesthoodletters on this subject, and of coursemany of you have already grasped the important axioms on your own. To date Ihave developed this subject only atthe Magistry level via a letter to the Masters.At any rate, magic is not merely a “blind”, nor should Dee’s work be interpretedas only a cover-up operationfor his cipher/spying work. That was a component of his work, but not nearly theentire story. In the near futurethere will be a Priesthood letter on magic, and the Scroll and the Ruby Tabletwill develop the topic at the I°/II°level. But it is necessarily the case that a great percentage of thisinformation will be transmitted on an individual-to-individual basis.Is the Temple, in discussing its survival in a future context which does notinclude the survival ofthe United States or other host countries, being treasonable or revolutionary ina political sense?No. We would be treasonable or revolutionary only if we deliberately or activelyworked towards overthrow ofthe state, or if, through intentional withholding of political information, wein effect contributed towards statedownfall or overthrow.But it is not treasonable for the Temple to simply be unconcerned with thepolitical issues of the United Statesor any other country when we formulate our own policies.In fact the principle of the separation of religion and state requires a truereligion to avoid concerning itselfwith governmental matters of host countries. In the United States a church whichworks avowedly either for oragainst the government is liable to lose its tax-exempt status on preciselythese grounds.The point in our case is that the Temple will not state its policies anddoctrines relative to political/governmental policies and doctrines. Rather we will state our position relativeto Set, his Temple, and hisPriesthood.Incorporation & tax-exemption do not signify either approval of the Setianreligion by the state or thebestowing of special privileges upon us.Incorporation is a device for ensuring the protection of the Temple within thestate’s legal structure, byenabling the Temple to be regarded as a “legal person” for purposes of propertyownership and court standing. Itpermits the Temple a legal existence apart from the individuals who constituteit.As for the exemption ruling, it too expresses neither approval nor disapprovalof our religious philosophy perse. It merely recognizes the fact that we are a legitimate and true religion byestablishing that the state does nothave the right to tax us.When we accepted the exemption, we agreed thereby to reciprocate - to keep ourorganizational policies andassets out of any political campaigns. Legally the exemption ruling is a sort of“pact of mutual nonintervention” -which is what the separation of religion and state is all about.So the Temple will develop its plans regarding the future as it sees fit, inkeeping with our understanding ofthe Will of Set and without regard to any national or governmental fortunes.As individuals, Setians themselves may have certain obligations of citizenshipto their respective countries.Where such obligations do not conflict with the Setian religion, the Templetakes no position concerning them -again because of our non-concern with political or governmental matters. Wherethere appears to be a conflict, wewill consider each case on an individual basis before rendering an opinion. Hereagain we must be careful to ensurethat Temple positions are dictated by our religious principles, and are notmerely “votes” concerning political issues.Are we being “Closet Trekkies”, or is the second problem of Setamorphosis adifferent thingaltogether?It is not entirely coincidental that the Æon of Set happened to occur at a timewhen escape-from-Earth themesare in vogue, the Star Trek revival being the most spectacular.The influence of a magical æon extends throughout the entire civilization of itstime; indeed the Word andFormula of an æon are simply a condensation of the “theme” of the æon. Moreoverif you look closely enough, you- 162 -will see that the Temple has identified and pinpointed the practical andappealing components of the escapistthemes, while rejecting factors that are irrelevant or illogical.In the case of Star Trek, for example, we do not assume the existence of astable “home base”, nor of a series ofadventures on populated planets, nor of a static human condition.Setamorphosis presupposes a third stage of human evolution. It may or may notinvolve linear space-travel; that is just one of the possibilities. It is entirely disassociated fromgovernmental order of any sort, being aphenomenon on a far more profound scale. Finally it is not a question of spacialrelocation, either permanent ortemporary, but of transformation into an entirely new existence - a Coming IntoBeing.Hence the Temple and the Star Trek revival are two different animals. In fact,you will find that manysupposed similarities are actually the result of unconscious projections ofSetian themes and principles into StarTrek episodes!The High Priest’s Pointed EyebrowsIt is logically improbable to assume that such a chance feature possessesextraterrestrial significance.Is Carpathia Forge building a Starship in the Nevada Desert?Not just yet.If Einstein were wrong, how come so many authorities think he’s right, and howcome practicalapplications of his theories work?I addressed myself to only one Einstein theory - the one that states thatfaster-than-light travel is impossible.And my rejection of that theory was actually based upon my acceptance of anotherEinstein theory - being that allmotion is relative. My statement is merely that a theory arguing for a fixedvelocity of light is inconsistent with onewhich states that all motion is relative. Period.Other Einsteinian theories dealing with nuclear physics, gravitation, fieldtheory, etc. are not affected. As forarguing that a fixed velocity for light must exist because a great many peoplethink it does, that is a logical fallacyknown as “authoritarian argument”. Tell Columbus and Copernicus all about it!How much of Setamorphosis is speculation, and how much is fact?The answer is that it is mostly somewhere in-between. “Speculation” isunsubstantiated imagination, while“fact” is rock-hard evidence.Because Setamorphosis deals with the future, and because it deals with a higherstage of human evolution, itcannot be factual or exact. It must emphasize inductive, not deductive patternsof reasoning. But at the same timethe precepts upon which its essential argument is based are not whimsical; theyhave all been researched quiteextensively. For example, the Einsteinian component was written after about fourdays’ reading in about a dozenhigh-level physics texts. [“Genesis III” was even more rigorous, calling forabout thirty biological, genetic, andanthropological references.]Nevertheless I assume that Setamorphosis must have a wide margin for error. Ifwe knew all about it, we’d be“there” already!The theory is something which will Xeper as we go along. Hence it is not cast asa doctrine, but rather as aworking hypothesis. So let us talk about it, refine it, and develop it as moreinformation is discovered.Some Additional Considerations(1) As a result of Setamorphosis, one very interesting distinction betweenAdepts and the Priesthood has cometo light. It is that the Adept ability to view the future from atotally-detached and objective vantage-point is bothlimited and fragile.It may not seem so to the Priesthood intellect, but many of the precepts ofSetamorphosis can be unnervingand frightening to those of lesser initiatory cohesion. It rips the rug out fromconventional notions of ourevolutionary future, just as “Genesis III” ripped the same rug out from ourevolutionary past. This isn’t ring-around-the-rosie witchcraft; it's the very fabric of human existence being rewoven. Itis “heavy stuff”.Among I° and even some II° Setians, there will be a very strong psychologicaltendency to “run and hide” fromdata that demolishes sacred cows. [Remember how impressionable you were in yourI° and II° days.] So have a careabout what you say to whom. This is not to say that you should not discuss thismaterial with I°s and II°s. But do notexpect them to understand it as “automatically” as a III° would.(2) Must the Temple be obsessed with Setamorphosis? No. This is a “grand design”for the future - somethingwhich will Xeper gradually and intricately. The degree to which we can influenceit - or even identify it - is open toquestion. We should be alert to it and aware of it, that is all.- 163 -In the meantime we are individual magicians and philosophers with a multitude ofinterests, aptitudes,priorities, and ambitions. There is room for all of these things in the Templeof Set; indeed such diversity andegocentrism are vital to development of the true Black Magician.Additional supplements to Setamorphosis will be along as the course of eventsmakes updates and additionsnecessary. But Setamorphosis should be considered a sort of “sum of the futureparts” of the Temple and not “themost important part”.(3) The entire “tone” of Setamorphosis seems very futuristic, very cold-bloodedscientific, and very indefinite/uncertain. By definition, religions are supposed to have pat answers and becomforting They are not supposed tokeep you awake at night wondering how many dimensions you exist in, etc.Even the Church of Satan was a comforting religion in the old sense: It saidthat, even if appeals to God &Jesus would not work, appeals to the Devil and his demons would. The C/S was aDennis Wheatley novel come tolife, with necessary modifications to ensure that it would not actually violateany laws. And, even though we knewthat many of the demons in the Satanic Bible were Judaic/Christian creations andthat some were scattered willy-nilly across many religions and many civilizations, we still felt “deep down”that there was something reallyauthentic here that was not to be found in any other church.In the Temple of Set this “something” was finally brought into crystal-clearfocus as Set - who is undistorted,underivative, uncompromising, and even uncontroversial.Then, just as everyone’s Set-tling down in ancient Egypt, along comesSetamorphosis, and zoooom - we’retalking in terms of the most advanced concepts in physics and metaphysics.In point of fact it’s all quite consistent, because the Book of Coming Forth byNight makes it clear that the newÆon is a formula for the future and not a mere retreat to the pastoral existenceof ancient Egypt.Yet we can’t help feeling a certain amount of culture shock. And nostalgia. Mustwe say goodbye to werewolvesand vampires and ghosts and goblins and horned entities from the Pit and therest of the gang? Must a Setian be socerebral that every romantic superstition be abandoned?I have thought this over very carefully, and my feeling is this:The old C/S assumption that demons. were independent entities and intelligenceswhich could be addressedand activated through ritual is indeed obsolete. There is only one suchindependent entity -Set/HarWer in itscomplete aspect, and Set alone in its fully-directed intelligence.The other gods, goddesses, and demons do enjoy existence -but with an importantdifference: They arederivative of the human mind.This is not the same thing as saying that they are merely figments ofimagination. The mind is capable ofimagination, yes, but it is also capable of creation in a far more substantivesense. It can literally give life tostereotypical, archetypical, or unique gods or demons - very much like thecreation of the id-monster that took placein the famous film Forbidden Planet.The difference between the magician and the non-magician is thus easy toidentify: The non-magician issubject to spontaneous creation of such entities from his non-conscious Id, butthe magician is able to create themdeliberately from his conscious Ego.Indeed this explains a number of things:•It explains why the rituals of the Church of Satan worked.•It explains why a god, goddess, or demon could be evoked simultaneously in manydifferent ritualchambers.•It explains why the same entities have often appeared spontaneously tonon-magicians.•It explains why interpersonal curses and possessions work: because a magicianimplants thecreation of a certain demonic entity in the id of the victim’s mind.•It explains why the magician can effectively evoke Yog-Sothoth, even thoughYog-Sothoth seems tobe only a fictional character invented by HPL. [The magician, in practice,creates a real Yog-Sothoth from the “stereotypical blueprint” supplied by HPL.•It explains a great deal of Aleister Crowley.•It explains the direct access to the Powers of Darkness that characterizes thePriesthood of Set.And it does something else. It enables us to use the old ceremonies and ritualswithout feeling that we arekidding ourselves and doing something “stupid and primitive”. The difference isthat now we know what it is thatwe are actually doing. We know what the effect will be upon magicians who arepresent, and we know what theeffect will be upon non-magicians who are present. We know what remote resultscan be expected and why.Never were these things formulated, much less conceived, during the Age ofSatan. Not even Anton LaVey, Ithink, realized them. If you examine the magical instructions in the SatanicBible and Satanic Rituals, you will findthat they advocate procedures for influencing the non-conscious id of themagician to produce results. They do nottrain the ego to create the desired results deliberately and consciously.This realization is a bit of Setamorphosis, if you will, that could not Xeperuntil “orthodox Satanism” had beenswept aside by the new Æon.- 164 -I might add that this new concept of the basis for ritual magic is quite avaluable weapon in the hands of theSetian Priest. It is also valuable as a device for education and instruction.Therefore be careful to whom you explainit. As is my custom, I make no prohibitions. But I would recommend that thisknowledge be discussed no lower thanthe III°, for the reason that it could be damaging and even self-destructive toa mind that is not sufficiently self-reliant and self-conscious.[index-165_1.png][index-165_2.png][index-165_3.png][index-165_4.png][index-165_5.png][index-165_6.png][index-165_7.png]- 165 -A12: Temple of Set Reading List- by Michael A. Aquino V°/VI° (Ed.)1976-2003"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThe magical and philosophical interests of the Temple of Set span a wide rangeof disciplines. Use ofcommercially-published reference works, despite their respective drawbacks, isthus both essential and economical.It enables the Temple to concentrate its internal publications in areas in whichcritical information is eitherseriously substandard or altogether lacking.When using this reading list, keep in mind that the Temple is not a book club,but rather a religious institutionin which Initiates are expected to be practicing magicians. These books arerecommended not merely to entertain[though many of them are good at that too!], but more importantly to impartprinciples which may be applied andto provide facts which are helpful or essential to an understanding of theseprinciples.Ideally this list should contain only those works which are currently in printor which are generally availablethrough libraries. Unfortunately the unusual and exotic directions of ourinterests frequently necessitate titles whichare neglected, suppressed, and/or out-of-print. Some of these works areavailable only at excessive prices throughrare-book dealers; others seem to have vanished altogether.If you keep your eyes open while browsing through new/used bookstores, however,and if you makemaximum use of library and inter-library-loan services, you should be able totrack down the materials of greatestinterest to you. Many of the most interesting and valuable books may bediscovered by accident [?], when you arelooking for something else entirely [or just rooting around in dusty, darkstacks in the Arkham University Library].The only thing you can’t do is grumble about the fact that the book you wantisn’t presented to you on theneighborhood supermarket rack for $2.50. “Those who seek shall find.”In earlier editions of this list, notations were made as to whether a given bookwere in or out of print,including foreign editions. Experience has shown that this information, as wellas pricing, changes so frequently asto be unreliable. Setians seeking a particular book should check with Internetsearch engines, libraries, bookstores,or book-search services for current availability. Lending-library options areparticularly to be recommended, asprices for many of these works - particularly the out-of-print ones in“collector’s” fields - may be excessively high. Ifyou have doubts as to the worth of a given book at a price quoted to you, checkwith the source recommending thebook.- 166 -Internet Book Sales and Search ServicesThe following three websites (none of which are connected with or officiallyendorsed by the Temple of Set)may be useful to you in locating/acquiring desired books:http://www.amazon.comhttp://www.bookfinder.comhttp://aol.alibris.comUse of the Reading ListThe reading list is not intended to be doctrinal or dogmatic. The inclusion of abook in it should not be takento mean that all or even most of its premises and conclusions are endorsed bythe Temple of Set. Most have beenwritten by very wise people. A few have been written by cranks who just happenedto blunder into something thatwe want to know about. Hence your own discernment is critical. Bear in mind thatfew if any books are written forthe disinterested transmission of facts. Every author necessarily writes with amotive [besides the profit one] andfrom a point of personal perspective and/or bias.The reading list is selective but not exclusive. For each book on the list, manyalternatives may have beenconsidered and rejected for one reason or another over the last two decades.On your own you may - and probably will, if you pursue your initiationaggressively and conscientiously -discover works which appear preferable to some of those on the list, or whichyou think should be added to it. Insuch cases you are invited to send particulars. If your recommendation isadopted, the book will be added to thenext update of that category of the list, with your name as the recommender.UpdatesThis reading list is continuously and incrementally updated, and the mostcurrent list is included with eachnew Crystal Tablet sent out. Current updates of this introduction and allCategories are available in the CrystalTablet area of the Temple of Set Intranet.Letter CodesAfter each book title you will see one or more letter codes, which identify thebook as relevant to a particularinitiatory system currently embraced by the Temple of Set. “TOS” = Temple of Setgenerally. “COS” = Church ofSatan (I-X AS). “TRP” = Order of the Trapezoid. “SHU” = Order of Shuti. “VAM” =Order of the Vampyre. “LVT” =Order of Leviathan. Other codes may be added at any time to identify workspertinent to specific Orders of theTemple.Comments ByBefore the comments to each book are either initials (MA = Michael Aquino VI°,JL = James Lewis VI°, DW =Don Webb VI°, AL = Anton LaVey V°) or the name of the commenter.Non-English LanguagesThe Temple of Set has reached the point in its development where we have agrowing number of Initiates incountries whose native language is not English. We are now experimenting withGerman annotations to this list tosee if this will be useful and practical to German-speaking Setians. Annotationsin other languages may be addedlater. This is not only because of non-English-speaking cultures’ interest intranslations of English-language books.Some invaluable reference works exist only in non-English originals, andgradually the Temple will want to identifythem. [Roland Winkhart, Magister Templi IV°, Deutschland: “Diese Leselisteerhebt keinen Anspruch aufVollständigkeit. Alle Setianer werden gebeten, ergänzende Informationenbeizusteürn. Dies gilt insbesondere fürfremdsprachige Titel oder Titel, die im Buchhandel nicht mehr erhältlich sindund nur noch über Ausleihe oderFernausleihe von Bibliotheken (unter Nennung der Signatur) zu bekommen sind.(‘WU’ = WürttembergischeLandesbibliothek, Stuttgart.)”]- 167 -Research Level NumbersYou will see a research level number attached to each letter code. These areexplained as follows:-1:The specific information contained in this book is generally essential toInitiates of all degrees.The book’s treatment is unique, and substitution of another book on the samesubject is notrecommended.-2:The topical information contained in this book is generally essential toInitiates of all degrees.The book’s treatment is not unique, and other books covering approximately thesame materialmay be substituted.-3:This book should be considered supplementary to -1/-2 books in the samecategory. It is notessential, but is recommended rather for those who have a special interest inthe topic.-4:This book is suitable primarily for highly-specialized, technical research andis liable to beconfusing or misleading to readers without previously-acquired, basic knowledgeof the field inquestion. It should be considered supplementary to any -1/-2/-3 books in thesame category.-5:The contents of this book may be dangerous if applied by inexperiencedmagicians. III°+consultation and guidance strongly recommended.Films/Periodicals/Music/Organizations/Websites SectionsSections are gradually being added to each category to cover films, periodicals,recorded music, special-interest organizations, and Internet websites relevant to that category. Entriesin these supplementary sections willappear gradually over time - and when entries initially appear, they may befragmentary and even inaccurate untilwe have had time to check the data out and update/verify the entry in question.[Your recommendations andfeedback will be very helpful in this regard.]The RL-# coding system will not be used for these supplementary sections. Filmsand music, in particular, areartistic items subject to personal taste. The presence/description of a film orrecording on the list, therefore, shouldbe understood merely as a suggestion of something you might like to investigate,not as “sanction”.FilmEntries in this section will be designated with an “F” in front of theentry-number.There are many ways to see non-current films, of which the easiest are (a)waiting for them to come around ontelevision and (b) renting or buying them on videocassette or DVD. The Temple ofSet can’t help you much with theformer option, save to alert you to some titles to keep an eye out for.In the case of the latter option you can prowl your local video rental stores,or you can purchase a particularly-desired item by mail order.

Runic Arts and Sciences- 169 -Category 1: Ancient Egyptian HistoryÄgyptische Frühgeschichteas of February 26, 2003Ancient Egypt holds the distinction of being both the first true nation (asopposed to city-state)and the most enduring one - existing three times as long as the Roman Empire andfifteen times as longas the United States. Many of the political and social principles whichsustained Egypt are beingadapted for contemporary applications by the Temple of Set. Many Egyptiancultural and scientificachievements, some long forgotten or neglected, are also of special importancewhen considered in thelight of related areas of Setian concern. Because of its undeniable grandeur andmystery, Egypt has beensadly abused by occultists and sensationalists of later eras. Hence it is allthe more incumbent uponSetians to observe responsible standards of accuracy when referring to thepresent Temple’s ancientheritage.1A. The Mummy by E.A. Wallis Budge. NY: Collier Books, 1973. (TOS-2) MA: “Thisbook contains sections onhistory, magic, culture, and hieroglyphics. The late Keeper of Egyptian andAssyrian Antiquities for the BritishMuseum (and rumored initiate of the Golden Dawn), Budge has written manydetailed works on Egyptology. Theirshortcomings are minor: an overemphasis on Osirian interpretation of philosophyand occasional questionableassumptions (generally educated guesses based on whatever fragmentaryarchæological data were available duringhis lifetime). The Mummy is a good ‘basic Budge’. Written at the beginning ofthis century, however, it is necessarilydated. Its contents are best updated by comparison with recent theoriescontained in more modern works.”1B. Egypt the Black Land by Paul Jordan. NY: E.P. Dutton, 1976. (TOS-2) MA:“Jordan is a writer andproducer of archæological films for television, specializing in Egyptology. Thisbook, with chapters on history,society, religion, morality, technical/scientific achievement, and philosophy,is an excellent survey incorporatingrecent archæological data. Technical assistance from the Royal Scottish Museum’sCyril Aldred. A good work tocross-reference with #1A. Many beautiful photographs are included.”1C. The Larousse Encyclopedia of Ancient and Medieval History by Marcel Dunn(Ed.). NY: Harper & Row,1963 [reprinted 1972 (paperback) by Crown]. (TOS-3) MA: “The Egyptian section ofthis book is remarkablysuccinct and objective, which accounts for its inclusion in this category. Anadditional benefit is that the book iswritten sequentially, so that an episode occurring in one part of the world maybe followed by an episode takingplace in another area at the same point in time. The general library value ofthis book extends far beyond itsEgyptological applications. Indeed, Setians would do well to familiarizethemselves with the Larousse series,including such Encyclopedias as #3R, #24A/B/C, and Modern History (companion to#1C).”1D. Egypt Under the Pharaohs by Heinrich Brugsch-Bey. NY: Charles Scribner’sSons, 1891. (TOS-4) MA:“Brugsch-Bey was one of Germany’s most prominent Egyptologists of the lastcentury. This book was his finalpublication, and in it he endeavored to derive a history of Egypt entirely fromthe inscriptions on its survivingmonuments. Since most of the inscriptions are quoted in the text, the reader hasa means of assessing the author’sconclusions - a rare luxury in Egyptology. The book is understandably dated andmay be compared with worksincorporating more recent data.”1E. The Curse of the Pharaohs by Philipp Vandenberg. NY: J.B. LippincottCompany, 1975 [paperback reprintavailable]. [Deutschland: Der Fluch der Pharaonen. EuropäischeBildungsgemeinschaft, Stuttgart, 1978.] (TOS-3)MA: “Although written in a van Däniken-sensationalistic flavor, this bookcontains some interesting observationsconcerning Egyptian magic, priesthoods, tomb preparation techniques [includinganti-grave-robber devices], andsome of the major Egyptologists. Care is required to distinguish worthwhilelines of inquiry from the author’s morefanciful speculations.”1F. Secrets of the Great Pyramid by Peter Tompkins. NY: Harper & Row, 1971[paperback reprint available].[Deutschland: Die Geheimnisse der grossen Pyramide. Fischer Taschenbuchverlag,Frankfurt, 1979.] (TOS-3)(TRP-3) MA: “This is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the GreatPyramid of Giza. [See also #1K.] Itcontains a sophisticated discussion of the scientific and mathematicalprinciples incorporated in the monument, aswell as a history of archæological attitudes towards it. Extensivelyillustrated. It should not be confused with themany ‘pyramid fad’ books appearing shortly thereafter. Tompkins has written acompanion volume on obelisks, aswell as one devoted to pyramid structures in the western hemisphere: Mysteriesof the Mexican Pyramids (NY:Harper & Row, 1976). While not as impressive as the information concerning theGiza pyramids, this material is alsoworthy of study by those interested in architectural magic in general. Someprovocative additional materialconcerning the Great Pyramid is contained in The Mysteries of the Great Pyramidsby A. Pochan (NY: Avon#31492, 1978. Tompkins has also written the prefaces to #2AB and #5F.”- 170 -1G. The Pyramids by Ahmed Fakhry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961.(TOS-3) MA: “Fakhry(1905-1973) was Professor of Ancient History at Cairo University. This book is athorough survey of all the majorEgyptian pyramids, with supplementary chapters on building processes, the GizaSphinx, and related philosophy.His approach is essentially unsympathetic to those who ‘read mysticism into’ themonuments; hence this book is agood contrast to #1F. Nevertheless it is evident that Fakhry ignores data thatdo not support his solidly-materialisticapproach.”1H. Lives of the Pharaohs by Pierre Montet. Cleveland: World Publishing Company,1969. [Deutschland: DasLeven der Pharaonen. Propyläen Verlag, Frankfurt, 1970.] (TOS-3) MA: “Montet isa Member of the FrenchInstitute and Honorary Professor at the College de France. Rather thanattempting to cover Egyptian history in itsentirely, he focuses on the more significant periods, governments, philosophies,and rulers. The result is a book withmajor insights into such episodes as the Hebrew exodus, the Akhenaten period,and the Setian dynasties. Afterreading this book, you will be able to see the Osirian distortions in most ofthe less exactingly researched histories.”1I. A Book of the Beginnings by Gerald Massey. Seacaucus, NJ: University Books,1974. (TOS-4) MA: “A two-volume edition of about 1,200 pages. Massey was a poet and amateur Egyptologistin turn-of-the-century England,and this work was the first of his series on the topic. It was so radical adeparture from accepted archæologicalinterpretations that it was rejected in academic circles. The book’s contentionsare often startling, but Masseydocuments his arguments so thoroughly and carefully that criticism is decidedlydifficult. He is further anaccomplished linguist, reading and cross-referencing hieroglyphics fluently.Among the topics addressed: Egypt’sconnections with later civilizations’ mythologies, Egyptian origins ofpractically every Hebrew and Christian myth,Egyptian origin of the Hebrew language, the Setian religion as the most ancientin existence, the Hyksos not outsideinvaders but rather an indigenous Egyptian group, and periodic Setian/Osirianfactional control of the nation.”1J. The Natural Genesis by Gerald Massey. NY: Samuel Weiser, 1976 [two volumes].(TOS-4) MA: “Masseyconsidered this as the ‘second half’ of #1I. It continues the same themes, withthe noteworthy addition of anextensive and exhaustive chapter on Darkness and Setian symbolism in ancientEgypt. Also included are manyinvestigations into the cults of HarWer and Xepera, animalistic influences onprimitive human psychology, andphysiological influences on mythical systems. There are innumeral surprisetidbits along the way, such as evidencefor the Egyptian origins of the waters of ZamZam [see #6L]. A linguisticcomparison of Sanskrit and Egyptianhieroglyphics [no mean feat!] is appended. 1,050 pages.”1K. Ancient Egypt, the Light of the World by Gerald Massey. NY: Samuel Weiser,1976 [two volumes].(TOS-4) MA: “Massey’s final work, originally published in 1907. In theintroduction he said: ‘Comparativelyspeaking, A Book of the Beginnings was written in the dark, The Natural Genesiswas written in the twilight,whereas Ancient Egypt has been written in the light of day.’ This work coversmuch the same ground as his earliereditions, but it includes a major attack on Hebrew/Christian mythology. Onesuspects that this may be the reasonfor the reluctance of Western society to accept, much less endorse Massey; thosewho interrupt soothing fictionswith irritating facts are rarely welcome. 944 pages. [In 1974 Samuel Weiser alsopublished Gerald Massey’sLectures in hardcover. This volume is recommended as a supplement to Massey’stheoretical works, since itcomments upon their theses in a series of lecture texts. It will not be veryintelligible to the reader who has notpreviously read #1I/J/K, however.]”1L. Pyramid Odyssey by Wm. R. Fix. NY: Mayflower Books, 1978. (TOS-3) MA:“Recommended assupplementary reading to #1F. Fix is the first author to make a criticalanalysis of Tompkins’ contentions concerningthe Pyramids. In doing so he traveled to Giza and discovered that many factsconcerning the Pyramids’measurements which were taken for granted by various authors are unsubstantiatedby first-hand measurement. Fixalso details various discoveries concerning the monuments which do not appear inother works on the subject. Fixhimself is an amateur rather than a professional Egyptologist or archæologist,but his arguments are impressive forthe obvious care with which they are constructed. [See also #2O.]”1M. Egypt Before the Pharaohs by Michael A. Hoffman. NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1979.(TOS-4) MA: “Anacademic, archæological text written in language intelligible and meaningful tothe layman. This is the first modern,coherent treatment of Egyptian history and prehistory ca. 700,000 BCE to 3100BCE and includes interestingevidence and speculations concerning the origins of the Egyptians’ religious andphilosophical traditions, includingthe predynastic influence of the Set and Horus cults. Author a Ph.D. inAnthropology and a Professor at theUniversity of Virginia.”1N. Chronicle of the Pharoahs by Peter A. Clayton. NY: Thames & Huston, 1994.(TOS-3) DW: “The most up-to-date Pharaonic history.”1O. A History of Ancient Egypt by Nicholas Grimaal. Oxford: Blackwell, 1992.(TOS-2) DW: “Grimaal ‘hasmanaged to transform - without disguising current gaps in knowledge - disparatesources of evidence and the result- 171 -of many different disciplines into a coherent historical sequence’. In thepaperback version Kent R. Weeks (of KV5fame) has added a nice section of further reading in English. Grimaal is aProfessor of Egyptology at the Sorbonne.”* * *F1A. The Egyptian. MGA, 1954. MA: “This film was one of the ‘sword and sandals’Cinemascope spectacularswhich were popular in the 1950s. Adapted from Mika Waltari’s novel, it tells thestory of an Egyptian physician,Sinue (Edmond Purdom), involved in court intrigues during the reign of Akhenaten(Michael Wilding). Takingdramatic license, the film skips Tutankhamun, jumping the throne immediately toHoremheb (Victor Mature),alternately regarded as the founder of the 19th (Setian) Dynasty or as anon-dynastic Pharaoh between the 18th &19th Dynasties. This film is interesting not so much for archæology as for thepicture it sketches of court life andatmosphere in ancient Egypt. The Akhenaten era is a good subject for this, as ofcourse it involved conflicts betweenthe traditional priesthoods and the throne-patronized cult of Aten. Additionalroles are played by Jean Simmons,Peter Ustinov, and Gene Tierney. The soundtrack is available on the MGA labeland offers a nice selection of whatHollywood thinks ancient Egyptian music might have been like [but probablywasn’t].”F1B. Egypt: Quest for Eternity. National Geographic Society. MA: “Of all thearchæological surveys of ancientEgypt, this is - as is in keeping with NG productions generally - one of themost professional and visuallyimpressive.”F1C. Mysteries of the Pyramids. MA: “A film that investigates the Pyramids asincisively as #1F & #1Lremains to be made. But this is a nice ‘tourist trip’, with a nice guide (OmarSharif), if you can’t visit Gizapersonally.”* * *P1A. KMT. KMT Communications, 1531 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94115.MA: “A layman’sarchæological magazine devoted to ancient Egypt. Subscriptions only - notnormally available on newsstands.”- 172 -Category 2: Ancient Egyptian PhilosophyPhilosophie im alten Ägyptenas of July 10, 2004In a relatively short span of time, the Egyptian culture went from barbarism toan advanced andintricate cosmological philosophy. After the fall of Egypt’s initiatorypriesthoods - and the extinction ofhieroglyphic literacy - this philosophy survived only in crude and superficialapproximations, often soludicrous out-of-context that Egypt became a prime target for romantic fantasy.Not for another twothousand years would its true tenets begin to be rediscovered, and popularunderstanding of them isstill minimal - due, in no small part, to the significant dissimilarity betweenthem and mainstreamWestern philosophy and mysticism, which proceed largely from Judaic/Christianassumptions. For theSetian to understand the Temple of Set, it is first necessary to understand andexperience life as theinitiated Egyptians perceived it, then to temper that impression with modernscientific knowledge.2A. Egyptian Mythology by Veronica Ions. NY: Hamlyn Publishing Group, 1973[series updated & reissued1986 by Peter Bedrick Books]. [Deutschland: Ägyptische Mythologie. VollmerVerlag, Wiesbaden, 1970.] (TOS-3)(SHU-2) MA: “Detailed analyses of the many divinities, religions, and religiouscenters of Egypt, this book differsfrom others on the same subject by not over-emphasizing the Osirian religion(about which the most informationsurvived, accounting for the disproportionate emphasis accorded it by mostEgyptologists and archæologists).Contains much post-Budge data. Part of an excellent world mythology/religionseries by the same publisher. Othervolumes in the series include: Chinese, African, Persian, Scandinavian, Greek,Celtic, Roman, Christian, Indian,Near Eastern, North American Indian, Oceanic, South American, and Mexican &Central American.”2B. Before Philosophy by Henri Frankfort (author of #2Q) et al. Baltimore:Penguin Books, 1946. (TOS-3)MA: “A survey of higher cosmological, political, and moral thought prior toHellenic Greece. The section on Egypt,written by John A. Wilson, summarizes Egyptian cosmology, the concept andfunctioning of the state, and variousvalues of life. This material is particularly helpful in understanding theintegration of Egyptian cosmology into theentire political and social attitude and derivative structures & institutions ofthe nation. This book is generallyconsidered the classic work on its subject.”2C. From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt by E.A. Wallis Budge. London: OxfordUniversity Press, 1934.(Quality paperback reprint available) (TOS-4) MA: “This last major Egyptologicaltext written by Budgeincorporates many new archæological discoveries not yet made when he authoredhis earlier works. 545 pages longand extensively documented, it may be considered his magnum opus. It covers theentire range of Egyptian religion,with abundant quotes from actual texts and inscriptions. The Osirian cult isstill disproportionately emphasized,however, and the political/social applications of the religious philosophycovered are not treated in detail.”2D. The Egyptian Heaven and Hell by E.A. Wallis Budge. La Salle, Illinois: OpenCourt, 1974. (TOS-3) MA:“In this book Budge describes major Egyptian texts dealing with the Tuat (the‘afterworld’) - specifically the Book ofGates, Book of Am-Tuat, and other accounts of a non-Osirian orientation. Thismaterial is valuable as a contrast tothe more extensive and better-known Book of Coming Forth by Day (‘ Book of theDead’), which treats the samesubjects from an Osirian perspective.”2E. The Conflict of Horus and Seth by J. Gwyn Griffiths. Chicago: ArgonautPublishers, 1969. (TOS-4) MA:“This book contains both extensive quotes from Egyptian texts and analyses oflater treatments of the legend byHerodotus, Diodorus, Plutarch, and subsequent scholars. It remains thedefinitive work on the subject, with a 23-page bibliography. It is out of print, and few copies exist, so significantmaterial from it will be introduced from it aspertinent in Temple of Set papers. #2E may be considered a companion volume to#2G.”2F.

Although he accompanied hisargument with extensive documentation, the theory was initially considered tooradical to have substance.

Cleopatra by H. Rider Haggard. NY: Harper & Brothers, 1888. Reprinted 1987by Castle Books Divisionof Book Sales, Secaucus, NJ (ISBN 1-55521-122-4) [Deutschland: Kleopatra. ArthurSchilbach Verlag, Leipzig,1898.] (TOS-5) (LVT-5) MA: “Haggard, better known as the author of She and KingSolomon’s Mines, also producedthis extraordinary account of Egyptian initiatory priesthoods and theirrelationship to the national government. Theplot revolves around the hypothetical survival of a native line of succession,protected by the Priesthood of Isis,during the Ptolemaic era. Harmachis, last of this line is charged by thePriesthood to overthrow Cleopatra andreestablish the Egyptian dynasties. What transpires involves many lessonsconcerning initiation, honor, and theresponsibilities of a true priesthood and priest-kingship. Aspirants to thePriesthood of Set should accordingly takeseriously to heart the central theme of this story.” JL: “The meeting ofHarmachis with Cleopatra is that of onemagician encountering another and proving as did Star Wars, The Lord of theRings, and The Wizard of Oz that an‘evil’ can be overcome only by chance or a yet greater ‘evil’, bearing in mindthat ‘evil’ is in the eye of the beholder.The lessons of the central theme spoken of by MA for those aspirants to thePriesthood of Set are also extremelyimportant.”2I. Ancient Egypt by Maurice Maeterlinck. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd,1925. (TOS-4) MA: “Thisessay succeeds in capturing the atmosphere of Khem to a degree unmatched byother published works. Chapters onlife, the wisdom of the priesthoods, the secret religion, and the spiritualatmosphere of the land. [Maeterlinck is alsothe author of #18D.]”2J. Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt by James H. Breasted.NY: Charles Scribner’sSons, 1912. (TOS-4) MA: “Breasted was Professor of Egyptology and OrientalHistory at the University of Chicago,and this book is composed of a series of lectures given at a theologicalseminary. Although some of the sourcematerial is dated, this book covers the same ground as #2B with greatersophistication and detail. Egyptian texts arequoted and documented with precision, and appropriate attention is given tonon-Osirian aspects of the nationalphilosophy and to the integration of the religion with the entire state of beingof Egypt.”2K. The Mythical Origin of the Egyptian Temple by E.A.E. Reymond. NY: Barnes &Noble, 1969. (TOS-4)MA: “Primarily an archæological text, this book treats the actual constructionof Egyptian temples from the mythssurrounding them. Major sections cover actual use of the temples - somethingrarely to be found in other works onEgyptian religion - as well as the legends concerning the conception andconstruction of specific edifices. Reymondis precise with his facts; the book is dry but thoroughly scholarly. Useful as a‘hard archæological’ contrast to #2P.”2L. Her-Bak (two volumes) by Isha Schwaller De Lubicz. NY: Inner Traditions,1954. (TOS-3 alternative to#2AB) (SHU-1) (LVT-1) MA: “Although speculative and intuitive rather thanstrictly historical, Her-Bak describesthe experience of Egyptian priestly initiation clearly, coherently, andconsecutively. The two volumes are in the formof a narrative story whereby a young Egyptian, Her-Bak, undergoes both exotericand esoteric selection andschooling. Included throughout the narrative are many digressions into thesocial, political, and cultural life ofancient Egypt. A wealth of appendices provide more detailed discussions of someof the key concepts and pointsaddressed in the story proper. The reading of Her-Bak is a pleasant, reflective,and meditative experience - so muchso that one is occasionally relaxed to the point of sleep! Her-Bak’s Egypt seemsto be suspiciously free of theinterpersonal strife that characterizes so much of human society. If there is ashortcoming to this work, then, it isthat it doesn’t come to grips with ‘low’ human nature in the way that #2H, #2M,or Waltari’s The Egyptian can do.When all of life begins to seem like a Booth cartoon, read some Her-Bak. [For amore archæological treatment of theEgyptian priesthood institution, see #2AA.]” JL: “MA’s description of the twovolumes is concise and insightful. Onecould wish de Lubicz had Dr. Aquino’s ability to say a lot in fewer words. TheGM of the Order of Leviathan deteststhe Her–Bak books with a passion, but admits grudgingly that the set holds morethan its share of wisdom as Her-Bak Xepers from urchin to initiate.” DW: “The Schwallers were French Romanticswho undertook a magical andphilosophical interpretation of Egyptian culture and symbolism. I would includeSchwaller on my list of Magi; hisWord was Al Khemi, which was later reUttered by Ronald K. Barrett as Xem. Forone perspective on Schwaller seehis biography: Al Khemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political, and Private Aspects ofR.A. Schwaller de Lubicz by AndreVandenbroeck (Hudson, NY: Lindisfarne Press, 1987).”2M. Wisdom’s Daughter by H. Rider Haggard. NY: Del Rey #345-27428-8-195, 1922.(TOS-3) (LVT-2) MA:“Another approach to the subject of #2L in the form of a novel concerning theEgyptian initiation of Ayesha, centralfigure of Haggard’s She and its sequels. The novel’s orientation is firstOsirian [Ayesha’s initiation is as a Priestess ofIsis] and ultimately theistic, but her use of her priesthood is quite Setian -thus leading her to the experiencesrecounted in She and Ayesha: The Return of She. Her-Bak this is not!” JL:“Anyone whose only exposure toHaggard’s She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed is #F2B is missing a great deal. The movie’scharacters cannot hold a candleto the actual Black Magician which Ayesha is. Members of the Order of Leviathanwill benefit from seeing the mind- 174 -of the Priestess [at least nominally of Isis] in motion as she plans for thepresent and future, invariably confoundingher foes. Time and circumstance are the servants of Ayesha, not her masters.”2N. Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs by Richard J. Gillings. Cambridge:MIT Press, 1972. (TOS-4)MA: “This is a scientific textbook; its chapters are filled with mathematicalformulæ and calculations as theEgyptians employed them. Apart from the purely technical evidence it offersconcerning the high level of Egyptiancivilization, it may be considered an interesting cross- reference with #12E and#12F.”2O. Star Maps by Wm. R. Fix. London: Octopus Books, 1979. (TOS-3) MA: “In thisbook Fix, the author of#1L, undertakes the somewhat more ambitious task of making sense out of Egyptian‘out of the body’ writings,specifically with regard to extraterrestrial life sources and life-after- deathmodes of existence. This book has strongpoints [interesting analyses of various inscriptions, correlations to the workof Lockyer (#2F) and Lilly (#19N)] andweak points [accounts of ‘astral’ experiences of dubious authenticity andrelevance, i.e. Stanford Research Institute(see #19W)]. Yet Fix brings to this study the same sincerity and tenacityevident in his earlier work; he is trying tomake sense of some admittedly perplexing data. His conclusion is that man isprimarily a metaphysical and onlydegeneratively a physical entity, and that his eventual triumph over thephysical orientation will enable the initiatedintelligence to return to a universal/stellar mode of unrestricted existence andconsciousness. In this theme Fix hasmuch in common with most of the initiatory texts and stories in this readinglist category. This book could also beclassified in categories #18 or #19, but is placed here because of Fix’ manyreferences to ancient Egyptian texts andphilosophies. A well-researched and argued hypothesis, not a definitivestatement.”2P. The Temple in Man by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. Brookline, Massachusetts:Autumn Press, 1949. (TOS-4)MA: “De Lubicz, an alchemist [in the philosophical sense] became an amateurEgyptologist, residing near Luxor for15 years. In this book he presents the thesis that Egyptian temple constructionhas certain geometric andarchitectural relationships to the human body. Further - and perhaps morecentral to his Egyptologicalcontributions - he proposes that any study of ancient Egypt prenecessitatesone’s personally assuming theEgyptians’ philosophical outlook. Otherwise the monuments and writings conveydistorted meanings. The clarity,logic, and coherence of #2L (written by his wife) are the best possibletestimony to this approach.”2Q. Kingship and the Gods by Henri Frankfort (Editor of #2B). Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 1948.(TOS-3) MA: “A comparative study of the institutions of Egyptian andMesopotamian kingship and theirrelationship to the respective religious and magical codes of the lands inquestion. Relevant to the Temple of Set notonly because of the historical material contained, but also because of itsindication that Platonic concepts of the roleof the philosopher-king originated in Egyptian governmental tradition.”2R. Principles of Egyptian Art by Heinrich Schaefer (Emma Brunner-Traut, Ed.)(John Baines, Trans. Ed.)Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974. [Deutschland: Von ägyptischer Kunst, besondersder Zeichenkunst. HeinrichsVerlag, Leipzig, 1922.] (TOS-4) MA: “From E.H. Gombrich’s foreword: ‘This bookis more than a classic ofEgyptology. Its results must be of interest to art historians, psychologists,and philosophers who concern themselveswith systems of signs and their role in communication. It constitutes indeed theonly attempt ever made ofanalyzing an artistic style as a mapping procedure. Schaefer has successfullyreconstructed the key we have toconsult if we want to interpret an Egyptian image in terms of what it isintended to represent. Put in another way, heteaches us the rules of transformation we must apply if we want to translate anEgyptian representation into thecorresponding verbal description of a real or imaginary situation.’”2S. The Opening of the Way by Isha Schwaller de Lubicz. NY: Inner Traditions,1979. (TOS-3) MA: “A non-fictional treatment of some of the main themes of #2L by the same author. As isthe case with some of thephilosophical dialogues in #2L, the writing style is a bit on the dry side.Moreover the argument culminates in asomewhat lame proposal for gnostic Christianity, which is presumably the resultof the author’s feeling she has toend up in some kind of mode acceptable to the mainstream of Western religioustradition [a mistake]. The readershould not be put off by this, but should approach the text for what it doespresent competently.”2T. Egyptian Language by E.A. Wallis Budge. NY: Dover Publications, 1973.(TOS-3) MA: “A small,economical, and relatively easy-to-read introduction to Egyptian hieroglyphics.This book will not teach you tobecome fluent in ancient Egyptian, however; for that you would have to undertakemore extensive and exhaustivestudies. [Ten years of training was required of Egyptian scribes.] If you arenot deterred, proceed to #2U and #2X.”2U. An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary (two volumes) by E.A. Wallis Budge. NY:Dover Publications, 1978.(TOS-4) MA: “A reprint of the original 1920 dictionary, which is virtuallyunavailable outside of libraries. Thoughflawed by some later discoveries in hieroglyphic translation techniques, thisremains the most available and easy-to-read publication of this type.”- 175 -2V. Symbol and the Symbolique by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. NY: Inner Traditions.(TOS-4) MA: “Anintroduction to the vital [as opposed to rational] philosophy espoused by theauthor in #2P. This book specificallyaddresses the Egyptians’ use of symbol and symbolism in representing suchconcepts.”2W. The Gods of the Egyptians by E.A. Wallis Budge. London: Open Court, 1904(reprinted in two volumes byNY: Dover, 1969). (TOS-3) (SHU-2) MA: “Budge’s survey of the principal Egyptiangods and groupings of gods.Extensive and pertinent chapters concerning Set and Nepthys (who are usuallytreated rather superficially in otherbooks on this subject). A good cross-reference to #2A.”2X. Egyptian Grammar by Sir Alan Gardiner. Oxford: University Press, 1927 (ThirdEdition reprintedthrough 1979). (TOS-4) MA: “This 646-page hardcover book will teach you how toread and write hieroglyphic text,but it is a difficult and demanding undertaking. There is a dictionary in thelatter part of the book; while not as largeas that of #2U, it is generally acknowledged to be more accurate since itreflects advances in the field since Budge’stime. Currently selling for about £17 in London.”2Y. Sacred Science by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. NY: Inner Traditions, Englishtranslation 1982. (TOS-4) MA:“This book - the most extensive work by this author - might perhaps be describedas his version of the #2Sargument, supported by a non-fictional treatment of the principles espoused[pardon the pun] in #2L. It isnoteworthy for comparisons drawn to Pythagorean and Copernican thought. I wouldassess it as being somewhatmore speculative and subjective than a strictly-archæological analysis shouldbe, and again the author’s inclinationtowards an Osirian bias and a resultant Gnostic Christianity is - as in #2S -apparent.”2Z. Egyptian Mysteries by Lucie Lamy. NY: Crossroad, 1981. (TOS-3) MA: “Lamy wasa long-time student ofR.A.S. de Lubicz, and her superb Egyptian/hieroglyphic illustrations, both linedrawings and color paintings, may befound throughout his works as well as in the Her-Bak volumes. In this slim butelegant treatise on Egyptianreligious philosophy - also beautifully photo-accented and illustrated, shedisplays her considerable skill as anauthor and philosopher as well. In keeping with what I am tempted to call the‘de Lubicz style’, the discussion ismarked by serenity and quiet reverence for the concepts being treated; this isno ‘textbook’ that treats the ancientEgyptians like so many interesting bugs to be dissected. 96 pages - about thesize of one of the Hamlyn books. Morediverse than #2A in its treatment of philosophical concepts, and I would saymore insightful as well - but not nearlyas systematically organized. This is a ‘browsing and enjoying’ book.”2AA. The Priests of Ancient Egypt by Serge Sauneron. NY: Grove Press (Black CatEdition), 1980. (TOS-3)MA: “Serge Sauneron is a former Director of the French Oriental ArchæologicalInstitute in Cairo, and hasparticipated in excavations in Tanis and Karnak. In this 190-page book hefocuses on the concept of the priesthoodas it evolved in the ancient Egyptian culture. Whereas #2L is more intuitivethan archæological, #2AA is solidly anarchæological work. Chapters deal with: the priestly function, the world of thetemples, the sacred activities, thesacred wisdom, and the fortunes & misfortunes of the priesthoods. The rise andfall of various priesthoods over thedynasties is also discussed in some detail, including the renaissance of thePriesthood of Set during the XIX-XXDynasties.”2AB. Serpent in the Sky: The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt by John Anthony West.NY: Julian Press, Inc.(ISBN 0-517-56635-4), 1987. (TOS-3 alternative to #2L) MA: “An extremely lucidand concise summary of the deLubicz interpretation of Egyptology, easily available in this high-qualityoversized paperback. Preface by PeterTompkins, author of #1F. Whereas #2L presents these ideas through the medium ofa narrative story, this book iscompletely analytical in format. The essence of de Lubicz’ argument is that, inits literature, art, and architecture,Egypt incorporated an extremely sophisticated metaphysical philosophy which mustbe intuitively apprehended, notmerely archæologically deciphered. Such a heretical approach to Egyptology hasmade de Lubicz anathema toconventional Egyptologists, but they remain unable to refute his propositions.”2AC. Symbol and Magic in Egyptian Art by Richard H. Wilkinson. London/NY: Thamesand Hudson Ltd,1994. (SKM-1) DW: “This book is a follow-up to Wilkinson’s Reading Egyptian Art.It deals with the symbolism ofform, size, location, materials, color, numbers, hieroglyphs, actions, andgestures. Full of examples, and anexplanation which is both readable and scholarly.”2AD. Hieroglyphics Without Mystery: An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Writingby Karl-TheodorZauzich (translated and adapted from the German (Verlag, 1980) by Ann Macy Roth.Austin, TX: University ofTexas Press, 1992. ISBN 0-292-79804-0 (pbk.) (TOS-3) DW: “This is a small volumethat attempts to fill the gapbetween the child-level introductions to the Egyptian language and the standardtext, Sir Alan Gardiner’s EgyptianGrammar (#2X). Written primarily for tourists and museum visitors, it impartsthe information required to readshort inscriptions. The material on vocabulary and grammar is both wellorganized and very readable. The first partof the book contains a concise description of the writing system, and the secondpart applies it to several dozenphotographs of inscriptions. It also has a number of useful appendices,including suggestions for pursuing further- 176 -study of the hierogylphs. There are also many workbook-style problems in thetext.

ISBN 0-918986-75-3. (TOS-4) DW: “Iwas very glad to hear that Ritner’srevised dissertation is reprinted. Thanks for letting us know, Priest Radtke. Itis the absolute best source, with onlytwo drawbacks. It is costly (US$50). It assumes some familiarity with Egyptianthought/language. If you really wantto do Egyptian magic, you need this book.” From the publisher’s announcement:“To date no comprehensivetreatment of Egyptian magic has focused on the practice of the magician. Bothgeneral studies and textualpublications have emphasized instead the religious elements in the contents ofrecited spells, while theaccompanying instructions, with their vignettes and lists of materials,instruments, and ritual actions, remaineduninvestigated. This study represents the first critical examination of such‘magical techniques’, revealing theirwidespread appearance and pivotal significance for all Egyptian ‘religious’practices from the earliest periodsthrough the Coptic era, influencing as well the Græco-Egyptian magical papyri.The author also discusses the‘pagan-Egyptian’ influence on Old and New Testament practices and in the livesof the Coptic Desert Fathers. Thesecond edition includes minor corrections from the original edition. ‘Thisvolume is a significant revisionistapproach to ancient Egyptian magic. As a result of a methodical analysis of boththe textual and archæologicalrecords, Ritner concludes that the boundaries between ancient Egyptian magic,religion, and medicine were not asstrictly observed as modern commentators believe. Furthermore he categoricallydenies the frequent attempts ofmoderns to define ancient Egyptian magi as a phenomenon dealing with thesupernatural, practiced primarily fornefarious purposes sub rosa by individuals outside of the religious mainstream... Ritner’s engaging prose style andfelicitous exegesis of even the most arcane material make for easy reading. Butmore important still, the content ofthe work ensures that it will become a vital reference tool for all engaged inany aspect of ancient Egyptianreligion.’ [From a review in Journal of the American Oriental Society 114 (1994)513].” To order, contact OrientalInstitute Publications Sales, 1155 E. 58th Street, Chicago IL 60637, or callChris Kahrl (Sales Manager) at (312)702-9508, or email Chris at c-kahrl@uchicago.edu2AF.

The Ancient Egyptian “Tale of the Two Brothers” by Susan Tower Hollis.Norman, OK: University ofOklahoma Press, 1990. (TOS-4) (SKM-1) DW: “The Papyrus d’Orbiney has a reworkingof an Egyptian fairytaleknown as the ‘Tale of the Two Brothers’ into a Setian initiatory manual. Thepapyrus was written for Prince Seti-Merenptah, who later became Seti II. Dr. Hollis’ book is a great scholarlyexamination of the papyrus with manyuseful, hard-data insights into the nature of life, Set, Anubis, rebirth, andRemanifestation. It may be a bitchallenging to someone new to Egyptology.”2AI. The Secret Lore of Egypt: Its Impact on the West by Erik Hornung and DavidLorton (trans.). CornellUniversity Press, 2002. ISBN: 0801438470. (TOS-4) Patty Hardy IV°: “This volumedocuments the most visible,persistant, and pervasive legacy of ancient Egypt: esoteric teachings and arts,mystery schools, and secret societies,architectural tributes and political movements reflecting a view of Egypt asfountainhead of wisdom. For thisperspective he coins the term ‘Egyptosophy’. [This book could also go in RL#4,as a survey of the roots ofcontemporary occultism.] Hornung, a Professor Emeritus of Egyptology at theUniversity of Basel, writes that‘scholarly concern with the esoteric tradition is still in its infancy andstands in inverse proportion to the immenseimportance of the esoteric among the general public’ and muses: ‘Are we headingfor a new Renaissance in whichEgypt, though in a very different form, will again play a role?’”2AJ. The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs by JanAssmann and AndrewJenkins (trans.). Hardcover: New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002 (ISBN:0805054626). Paperback: HarvardUniversity Press, 2003 (ISBN: 0674012119). (TOS-3) Patty Hardy IV°: “Thishistory strives to trace and documenttransformations of meaning - changes in the philosophy and self-image of ancientEgyptian - using three sources ofevidence: ‘traces’ (material artifacts), ‘messages’ (the content of inscriptionsand papyri, which contain both explicitand implicit clues to the authors’ perspective), and ‘memories’ (folklore, mythand other narratives of theremembered past). Each source has strengths and blind spots. With these threesources Assman braids a history ofEgypt from unification to the birth of modern Egyptology - which Assmann viewsas a victory of the ‘traces’ school- 177 -over rival interpretations of ancient Egypt. But this victory is not the lastword: ‘Today we know infinitely more abutEgypt than did the experts of the eighteenth century. But we are also infinitelyless sure of what to do with thatknowledge. Only gradually are endeavors emerging to supplement that antiquarianpreoccupation with traces (themerits of which are beyond question) with an attempt to enter into a dialoguewith the newly readable messages ofancient Egyptian culture and thus to reestablish them as an integral part of ourcultural memory.’ Since 1976Assmann has held a professorship of Egyptology at the University of Heidelberg.Assmann makes points generallyrelevant to the Setian interest in Egypt: (a) the West is viewed as having ‘dualfoundations’ in Greek classicism andHebrew religion, but both of these are responses to contact with Egypt; (b) thiscultural legacy of Egypt continuallyremanifests and re-informs the West, regardless of the suppressed ordisreputable cast given to it.”2AK.

Patty HardyIV°: “Popular understanding ofancient Egypt rests on the juxtaposition of impressive images (documentariesportraying the Pyramids, the treasureof Tutankhamen) with a hostile religious subtext ( The Ten Commandments, ThePrince of Egypt). This 500-pagepaperback allows the ancient Egyptians to speak for themselves, in tones witty,humorous, reflective, moral,passionate, and imaginative.

It is necessary forthe Setian to acquire at least a working familiarity with such systems, as theinformation gained is oftenuseful in the development of both Greater and Lesser Black Magical techniques.Furthermore, while theoriginal Priesthood of Set did not survive the decadence and downfall of Egypt,many of itscharacteristics were either preserved by other cultures or independentlydiscovered by initiates of othermagical/philosophical systems. The works selected for this category are intendedto survey the moreelaborate and esoteric concepts of intellectual elites throughout the ancientMediterranean and WesternEuropean cultures.

(TOS-3) (SHU-1) (LVT-1) MA: “Still the standard reference work on thetopic, containing chapters on thedevils and dæmons of many cultures from antiquity to the present. Included aremany perceptive observations onthe concept of ‘evil’ in human behavior. In his Confessions Aleister Crowleyremarked: ‘Carus had always interestedme as being widely learned, yet understanding so little. After meeting him, Idecided that I liked him for it.’” JL:“Occultists of ye olden days believed that to know the name of a demon was tohave power over him. They werecorrect only insofar as their belief was an attempt to define a principle orsupposed entity and therefore have thepower to use it through understanding it. In the case of #3B, Carus’ work hasplaced a name and brief history withalmost every devil for whom one could wish , and with a few for whom one wouldnot. Attractive or otherwise, thedemons in #3B are named, traced, and cross-referenced. The Order of Leviathanmember can find historicalbackground in the book and use it to follow the trail of the Serpent.”3C. Christian Mythology by George Every. NY: Hamlyn Publishing Group, 1970.(TOS-3) MA: “Another in theHamlyn mythology series [see #2A], updated & reissued in 1986 by Peter BedrickBooks. It exposes the origins andadaptations of Christianity and includes a number of later legends quite at oddswith the Bible. The author’scomments on the psychological need for specific myth-types are quiteilluminating. The book is neither pro nor con- merely analytical. Hence it is an excellent source of data for dialogues withChristians; you can respond totheological issues on a historical rather than on an emotional, dogmatic, oræsthetic basis.”3D. The Romance of Sorcery by Sax Rohmer. NY: Causeway Books, 1973. (TOS-3) MA:“Better known as theauthor of the Fu Manchu novels [fun to read if you’re into 1890’s ‘Yellow Peril’themes and heroines who faint a lot],Rohmer was also an initiate of the Golden Dawn who dreamed of writing anauthoritative commentary on theoccult. This book was the result - an empathetic but not-uncritical profile ofhistory’s prominent sorcerers, includingApollonius, Nostradamus, Dee, Cagliostro, Blavatsky, and Francis Barrett.Written in 1913 and especiallycommended by Harry Houdini.”3E.

RengerVerlag, Leipzig, 1900.] (TOS-3) MA: “Written in 1875 and revised in 1897, thisremains the major work on the topic.It does full justice to its ambitious title. In addition to discussing thecharacteristics of secret societies per se,Heckethorn includes comments on the clandestine operations of supposedlyabove-ground organizations (such asthe Jesuits).

Individual magicians profiledinclude Apollonius, Dee & Kelly,Cagliostro, Saint Germain, Agrippa, and Faust.”3H. The Secret Societies of All Ages by Manly Palmer Hall. Hollywood:Philosophical Research Society, 1928.(TOS-4) MA: “Available in a variety of sizes and pricetags, this book contains45 chapters on just about everythingremotely connected with the Rosicrucian/Masonic tradition. Hence there isconsiderable material on Egypt, thePythagoreans, Atlantis, the Cabala, etc. It is admittedly a treasure-house ofsorts, but the intelligent reader will notean abundance of unsupported speculation. There are no footnotes, bibliographicalreferences, or documentaryattributions. Accordingly this volume is best used as an introduction tointeresting areas of study rather than as adefinitive text concerning them. It [particularly the larger/more expensiveeditions] looks nice on a coffee-table. Thebiggest one (Golden Anniversary monster edition) is heavy enough so that you canbash a rat with it and bereasonably assured he’s now a two-dimensional rat. The information in this bookis also handy for confusing[equates to impressing] Masons and Rosicrucians whose cages you want to rattle.[If you want to understand whatFreemasonry and Rosicrucianism are all about, your best bet is #3E.]”3I. Encyclopedia of Occultism by Lewis Spence. New Hyde Park: University Books,1960 (originally published1920). (TOS-3) MA: “There are three ‘occult’ encyclopædias on this reading list,the others being #4E and #4F.Although dated, this one is extremely well researched, objective, and thorough.Its companion volume, NandorFodor’s Encyclopedia of Psychic Science, is less likely to be of interest orpractical value. Before acquiring a copy of#3I, consider whether #4E, which reprints extensively from it, will suffice foryour needs and interests.”3J. The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance by Wayne Shumaker. Berkeley:University of California Press,1972. (TOS-3) MA: “Shumaker is Professor of English at U.C. Berkeley. Thisdefinitive work includes sections onastrology, witchcraft, White Magic, alchemy, and Hermes Trismegistus -painstakingly footnoted and withthoughtful critical analyses. ‘The analyst does not take for granted thenecessary existence of truth, much less ofprofound, forgotten wisdom in any of the systems, but treats them objectively ashistorical efforts to understand theworld in which man is placed and to use his knowledge for human purposes.’ [Seealso #3N.]”3K. The Dark Side of History: Magic in the Making of Man by Michael Edwardes.NY: Stein & Day, 1977.(TOS-3) MA: “A fascinating investigation by a Professor of History and PoliticalScience into the roles of magic inmajor social movements of history - from Mesopotamia to the French Revolution toMaoist China. This might beconsidered a reflective essay rather than a documentary analysis, but Edwardes’work is a commendable efforttowards bridging the gap of ignorance that usually separates magic from thesocial sciences. Not as much fun to readas #4B, perhaps; but one doesn’t feel quite so far out on a limb either.”3L. The Western Mystical Tradition by Thomas Katsaros and Nathaniel Kaplan. NewHaven, Conn.: College &University Press, 1969. (TOS-3) MA: “A very good history of mysticism fromHellenic Greece onwards. Offers the‘mystical perspectives’ of many of the philosophers whose more materialisticconcepts are treated in tomes such as#16A.”3M. A History of Magic and Experimental Science by Lynn Thorndike. NY: ColumbiaUniversity Press, 1923(eight volumes). (TOS-4) MA: “Frazier’s Golden Bough - which would seem to be aninevitable component of areading list such as this - was ultimately not included because its focus onmythology as such (i.e. as an essentiallyanthropological phenomenon) offers no thesis which is usable by magicians.‘Magic,’ said Frazier in an oft-quotedpassage, ‘is science that doesn’t work.’ Since Black Magic as defined by theTemple of Set does work, and since weare not interested in variations that don’t work, we seek more illuminatinghistories to trace its development.Thorndike’s is one such. In this massive work he shows the complexinterrelationships between the magical, thescientific, and the philosophical from the time of ancient Egypt to the 17thcentury CE - after which the influence ofmaterialism and logical positivism acted to suppress both magic and philosophyin favor of an all-embracingscientific method. Like the unabridged Golden Bough, Thorndike’s opus is usuallyto be found only in majorlibraries. You should be aware of its existence for advanced research purposes.”3N. Pythagorean Palaces: Magic and Architecture in the Italian Renaissance byG.L. Hersey. Ithaca: CornellUniversity Press, 1976. (TOS-4) MA: “According to Pythagorean philosophy,numbers and proportions possessquality as well as quantity, and the elements of architecture approachexcellence as they maximize incorporation ofthese elements of quality. In this book Hersey, Professor of Art History at YaleUniversity, analyzes several ItalianRenaissance buildings according to the Pythagorean standards employed by theirarchitects. [See also category #12in general, as well as #3J. See also #6O for observations concerningarchitecture which is conspicuously lacking inPythagorean excellence.]”3O. A History of Secret Societies by Arkon Daraul. NY: Citadel Press, 1961.(TOS-3) (COS-3) AL: “A fine essayon the subject, with objectivity and much attention to detail.” MA: “This surveyincludes chapters on such groups as- 180 -the Order of the Peacock Angel (Yezidi), Knights Templar, Assassins, Sufis,Gnostics, Castrators, Vehm,Rosicrucians, and of course the Masters of the Himalayas. Used by the earlyChurch of Satan as a source documentfor appropriate magical and ritual material. No documentation is offered, sothis book is best considered at facevalue.”3P. The Lost Key to Prediction: The Arabic Parts in Astrology by Robert Zoller.NY: Inner Traditions, 1980.(TOS-3) MA: “The first part of this book is an exacting examination into thephilosophical and metaphysical basesfor astrological theory, resulting in the author’s postulate that the trueastrologer deals ‘with the material globes inastrology only insofar as they are used to time the movements of the inner“planets” and “stars” that lie hidden atthe center of man’s being’. Part Two consists of Zoller’s translation of a13th-century Latin astrological text by GuidoBonatti. In Part Three Zoller applies Bonatti’s concepts to the construction ofhoroscopes. One of the mostsophisticated conceptual studies of astrology yet penned. Reviewed in detail inRunes #III-1. The excellentbibliography is supplemented by extensive notes. The author is an ex-Adept II°of the Temple of Set and a practicingastrologer. [See also his review of #3R, described in that entry.]”3Q. Larousse Encyclopedia of World Mythology by Pierre Grimal (Ed.). NY:Excalibur Books, 1981. (TOS-3)MA: “As the title indicates, this is the ‘mythology’ volume in the Larousseseries of encyclopædias. 550 pages - infine print - jammed with information. Note that this book focuses on mythology,not on occultism, so it is moredescriptive of systems [from an archæological/anthropological/ sociologicalpoint of view] than analyticalconcerning their various merits, drawbacks, substance, etc. The editor is aProfessor at the Sorbonne in France.”3R.

Drömer-Knaur Verlag, München, 1986.](TOS-3) MA: “This is the bookexplaining the Voodoo system of Haiti and the manner in which zombis areactually created - not by supernaturalmeans, but by the secret use of poisons. The book is based upon field researchby the author, who holdsundergraduate degrees from Harvard University in Ethnobotany and Biology, andmore recently a Ph.D. inEthnobotany. #3R is reviewed in detail by Adept Robert Zoller (author of #3P) inScroll #XII-3, June 1986.”3S. The Books of the Beast by Timothy d’Arch Smith. London: Crucible (AquarianPress/Thorsons PublishingGroup, 1987. (TOS-4) MA: “This is a 126-page, high-quality paperback collectionof essays on Aleister Crowley,Montague Summers, Ralph Nicholas Chubb, Francis Barrett (author of The Magus,the book which revived aninterest in sorcery & ceremonial magic in 19th-century England), Florence Farr(author of #10I), and the BritishLibrary’s catalogue of erotica. This collection is cited here because of someinteresting anecdotes it contains reCrowley, Summers, Barrett, and Farr. If you are interested in one or more ofthem, you might enjoy this book as a‘casual read’. But I would not consider it essential.”3T. Testament: The Bible and History by John Romer. NY: Henry Holt, 1988.(TOS-3) MA: “A superb studyof the history of the Judæo/Christian Bible, to include its sourcing frompre-J/C cultures and mythologies and itsassembly and revision over the Christian period in Europe. There is also acompanion PBS television series, alsoexcellent, narrated by Romer. This study is valuable for its objectivity; Romeris not unsympathetic to the J/Ccultural heritage, but neither does he seek to distort its true historicalorigins. The author is a distinguishedEgyptologist and archæologist.”3U. Strange Superstitions and Magical Practices by William J. Fielding.Philadelphia: Blakiston Company(Circle Books), 1945. (TOS-3) Terry Quesenberry II°: “This little book issurprisingly objective and broad in itscoverage of superstition and magic in its manifold phases, considering the timeit was published. Topics coveredinclude Satanism, Black Mass, Walpurgisnacht, lycanthropy, pentagram (as anemblem of perfection), evil eye,Nietzsche, mysteries of nature, mysteries of number, ancient Egypt, divination,magic of mathematical formulæ,dæmonology, origins of pagan holidays, and witchcraft.”3V. The Devil in Legend and Literature by Maximilian Rudwin. La Salle: OpenCourt, 1989 (latest reprint).(TOS-3) DW: “An alternative to #3B. For my money this volume, dedicated to thememory of Paul Carus, is muchthe superior volume.”3W. The Fifth Sun by Burr Cartwright Brundage. Austin: University of Texas,1983. (TOS-3) DW: “This bookexplains the Aztec mindscape rather well and includes great coverage ofTezcatlipoca, the Aztec Set. A good book toread for a cross-cultural perspective on Set.”3X. The Occult in America: New Historical Perspectives by Howard Kerr & CharlesL. Crow (Eds.). Chicago:University of Chicago, 1983. (TOS-4) DW: “Of historical interest to Setians bothsocially and in terms of thedevelopment of occult wisdom & folly in North America. Of particular interestare the effects of the Hindu Left-Hand Path (Vivekananda), Theosophy, and African religious practices. The openingessay, ‘Explaining ModernOccultism’ by Robert Galbreath, almost garners the book a TOS-1 rating.”- 181 -3Y. Hermetic Magic by Stephen Edred Flowers, Ph.D. York Beach, ME: SamuelWeiser, 1995. (TOS-1) DW:“This book is an analysis both scholarly & practical of the Southern tradition’sgreatest magical success [until theTemple of Set]. It deals with the synthesis of Greek & Egyptian traditions intoHermeticism; with ancient, modern,& postmodern theories of magic; and with practical spell-book methodology. TheHermetic tradition involvesgaining & using power, and this is the best gateway in the English language. Itis the Arrow handed by Arrabis tome.” MA: “The term ‘Hermeticism’ brings to mind vague, inconsistent, & impotentJudæo/Christian mystical fluff.This book has nothing to do with that. Rather Flowers explores the historicalfiltering of coherent Egyptian magicaltheory & practice through a number of later cultures, then explains how the coreconcepts may be put into effectivepractice.”3Z. The Presence of Shiva by Stella Kramrisch. Princeton: Princeton University,1981. (TOS-4) DW: “Thisbook, nicely reprinted as a Bollingen paperback, is a study of the figure ofRudra/Shiva, the ‘Set’ of Hinduism andfocus of much historical & current Hindu Left-Hand Path practice. It is anotherway to get a handle on the Prince ofDarkness beyond our usual Satanic & Egyptian lenses. ‘Rudra is consciousness,and his actions are its forms.’ Auseful initiatory model for those drawn to the gate of the East.”3AA. The Myth of Egypt and its Hieroglyphs in European Tradition by ErikIversen. Princeton: PrincetonUniversity, 1961 (Mythos Edition, 1993). (TOS-4) (SKM-1) DW: “Iversen looks atEgypt’s artistic, philosophical, &magical influence on European thought. A good historical backdrop to Schwaller,the Golden Dawn, Cagliostro, etc.”* * *F3A. Masada. 1981. MA: “This was originally a television mini-series, nowcondensed into a singlevideocassette. The fortress of Masada was one of the last strongholds of theZealots in ancient Israel to be conqueredby the Romans, and the film dramatizes this seige. Peter O’Toole is the Romangeneral and Peter Strauss hisHebrew counterpart. Most relevant to this category of the reading list is theRomans’ utilitarian use of religion incontrast to the fanatic belief of the Hebrews. The film does not pass a moraljudgment as much as it highlights aferocious battle fought because of different perceptions of reality.”F3B. The Devils. 1971. MA: “Probably the most graphic and horrifying treatmentof the Inquisition everbrought to the screen, this film recounts the story of the 17th-century Frenchpriest Urban Grandier (Oliver Reed)who was accused of signing a pact with the Devil. The political schemesresulting in Grandier’s downfall aredeveloped with cold precision, and his torture, mutilation, and death by burningat the stake are also shown ingraphic detail. This is one of the films strongly opposed by the CatholicChurch, for obvious reasons! The cast alsoincludes Vanessa Redgrave. Directed by Ken Russell (who also directed AlteredStates).”F3C. The Serpent and the Rainbow. 1988. (07-1587). MA: “This may have startedout as an attempt to bring#3R to the screen, but by the time Hollywood was finished with it, it was moreof a simple horror movie than a non-fictional study of Voodoo and zombification. Useful perhaps to catch somethingof the atmosphere of the grip whichmodern Voodoo has on its adherents in locales such as Haiti.”* * *P3A. Freethought Today. Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), Post Office Box750, Madison, WI53701. Telephone 608-256-8900. MA: “FFRF is a very feisty atheist organizationwhich publishes the bimonthlynewspaper Freethought Today (subscription about US$30/year). FT is almostcompletely devoted to exposes ofChristian corruption and violations of church/state separation, together withscholarly articles debunking Judæo/Christian mythology and superstition, all done to a professional standard. Amajor feature is the ‘Black CollarCrimes’ column, which dutifully recounts the ongoing epidemic of sex crimescommitted by Christian officials. TheTemple of Set does not spend much time J/C-bashing in the way that the oldChurch of Satan did, so if you’renostalgic for that kind of confrontation and would like lots of ammunition fordebates, an FT subscription isessential. It will also astound you to see how much dirt there is to dig up.”- 182 -Category 4: Occultism in Contemporary PerspectiveOkkultismus in zeitgenössischer Perspektiveas of February 26, 2003Aside from the Temple of Set itself, what may be said concerning the positiveachievements ofoccult research? Is the field substantive? And what is “the occult”? Thefollowing books explore theseand other questions in terms of current scientific and cultural knowledge.4A. The Occult by Colin Wilson. NY: Random House, 1971. [Deutschland: DasOkkulte. Heyne Taschenbuch-Verlag (01/7282), München, 1986.] (TOS-2) MA: “This book is divided into twoprincipal sections - a history ofEuropean and American occultism to the present century, and an extensivecommentary concerning occultmethodology from an existentialist point of view. Wilson postulates a ‘FacultyX’ of the human mind to explainpsychic phenomena. Here the weakness of a non-initiated approach to the subjectis glaringly demonstrated,because Wilson’s bibliography includes many sources of questionable quality.Moreover Wilson becomespredictably confused as he tries to explain his ‘Faculty X’ as a naturalpotential of the mind. The history section ofthe book is nicely done, though it also suffers from Wilson’s reliance upon somebiased sources. A more careful andreflective argument for ‘Faculty X’ is presented in Wilson’s Mysteries: AnInvestigation into the Occult, theParanormal, and the Supernatural (NY: Putnam, 1978), providing that oneexercises prudence in crediting some ofthe case studies.”4B. The Morning of the Magicians (original French title: The Dawn of Magic) byLouis Pauwels and JacquesBergier. NY: Avon Books, 1968. [Deutschland: Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend.Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag (Nr.11711), München, 1979.] (COS-3) (TOS-1) (TRP-1) (LVT-1) AL: “First and best workever done describing the Satanicinfluence in the world.” MA: “This is the book that kicked off the occultrevival of the 1960s and started the wholevan Däniken show on the road. It highlights many phenomena for whichnon-occultists cannot account [somewhatafter the fashion of Charles Fort]. Included is an especially interestingsection on German Nazi esoterica, which untilrecent years was virtually the only account of such material easily available tothe public. It is also the only recentbook to discuss the original Council of Nine (the Nine Unknown). If there is adefect to the book, it lies in itsemphasis of fanciful, rhetorical questions and in the lack of adequate footnotesin some of the most intriguingchapters. This is an excellent book to recommend to a friend who thinks you’recrazy for being interested in theoccult. [See also #17B and #22B.]” JL: “MA’s comment on the book says it all.”DW: “This book represents FrenchRomanticism at its height with a little Gurdjieff thrown in. It inspired a hugeoccult revival in France. It has atwofold Solve effect: It makes the reader ‘wake up’ a bit and realize the effectof the suprarational in history. Itsenthusiastic reception in English-speaking countries facilitated the translationof related French authors such as deLafforest (#6O) and Charroux. This contributed to the rise of movements in thosecountries such as ‘New Wave’science fiction and the Church of Satan. This book is not as unique in the 1990sas in the 1960s, in part because of itsown success in encouraging more sophisticated and current imitators andsuccessors. Fun for inspiration, but takewith many grains of salt.”4C. The Black Arts by Richard Cavendish. NY: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1968.[Deutschland: Schwarze Magie.G.B. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt, 1969.] (COS-3) (TOS-3) AL: “Good basic primer onthe subject.” MA: “Still the mostlucid introductory book on the subject of ‘general occultism’. Chapters onnumerology, Cabalism, alchemy,astrology, ritual magic, Black Magic, and Devil worship. Very dispassionate,with esoteric doubletalk kept to aminimum. If you’re relatively ‘new to occultism’ and would like to survey thesubject from a non-Temple of Set-particular point of perspective, try this book. Conspicuous defects include anexcessive emphasis on the HebrewCabala and on similarly superstitious techniques such as astrology, numerology,and alchemy.”4D. Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions by Mircea Eliade. Chicago:University of Chicago Press,1976. [Deutschland: Das Okkulte und die moderne Welt. O. Müller Verlag,A-Salzburg, 1978.] (TOS-3) MA: “This isa critical analysis of the current appeal of occultism, with case studies takenfrom the 1960s. Inclusive and generallywell-argued, though the cited source material indicates Eliade’s unfamiliaritywith in-depth documents anddoctrines in the murky forest of occultism. He is a distinguished Professor ofHistory of Religions at the Universityof Chicago and has penned many works of repute in the field.” DW: “I think thisis Eliade’s least interesting book.His others have my universal recommendation.”4E. Encyclopedia of the Unexplained by Richard Cavendish (Ed.). NY: McGraw-Hill,1974. (TOS-3) MA: “Thisis a very readable encyclopædia which emphasizes 20th-century occultism ratherthan the more historical materialtreated by #3I. Contributing editors and authors include such recognizedauthorities as Professor J.B. Rhine andEllic Howe (#10F, #14W). Rhine’s introductory essay ‘How to Cope with a Mystery’is excellent. 304 pages,profusely illustrated.”- 183 -4F. Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology by Leslie A. Shepard (Ed.). NY:Avon Books #48835,1980 (two volumes). (TOS-3) MA: “Basis for this large paperback set is #3I andits Fodor companion, whichShepard has updated with more recent material. A pretty good effort and worththe $20 pricetag.”4G. A Fascinating History of Witchcraft, Magic, & Occultism by W.B. Crow. NorthHollywood: Wilshire BookCo., 1970. (COS-3) AL: “Has much new material of interest to Satanic scholars.”4H. The Occult Sourcebook by Nevill Drury and Gregory Tillett.

The Haight-Ashbury: A History by Charles Perry. NY: Random House (VintageBooks #394-74144-7),1984. (TOS-3) MA: “There are many different kinds of ‘occultism’, including somethat don’t think of themselves,and aren’t usually described by others in that context. The ‘Hippie experience’was one such. At the time (ca.1966-69) it was fragmentary, unprogrammed, and generally difficult for eitherinsiders or outsiders to understand.It was far more than simply a drug-orgy, and - though Anton LaVey would probablybe loath to admit it - its valueswere very much those of the Age of Satan and its Word (Indulgence). Finallythere is a book which pulls it alltogether into a coherent (as much as possible) whole, showing how so many trendsof the post-World War II eralead slowly but inevitably into this particular ‘critical mass’, and how so manyof the values in the subsequentdecades have been charted along certain courses because of that same ‘criticalmass’. Included is an account of the9/21/67 ‘Satanic mass’ conducted by Ken Anger at the Straight Theatre, includingthe showing of the originalversion of Lucifer Rising, reportedly pilfered that evening by Bobby Beausoliel.See also Tom Wolfe, The ElectricKool-Aid Acid Test (NY: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1968), which focuses in on theLBM influence of Ken Kesey andhis Merry Pranksters.

(TOS-4) MA: “This volume combines the three originalpaperback novels The Eye inthe Pyramid, The Golden Apple, and Leviathan which comprise the Illuminatus!trilogy. Alternately referred to as‘the longest shaggy dog story in literary history’ and ‘a fairy tale forparanoids’, this is a rambling journey throughalmost every zany occult movement and conspiracy theory in contemporary society.I assume the Temple of Set wasspared only because the book was published the same year we were founded. Idon’t know what happened to Shea,but Wilson went on to publish some ‘non-fictional’ works in the same vein which,because they lacked the unself-conscious style of Illuminatus! , fell right into the category of publicationsso successfully lampooned byIlluminatus! . Truth, however, remains stranger than fiction, and within thepages of Illuminatus! you will actuallyfind many gems of, er, occult wisdom. This is perhaps a counterweight to Morningof the Magicians: a good book togive to someone who’s too obsessed with the occult!”- 184 -4N.

The Gurdjieff Work by Kathleen Riordan Speeth. Los Angeles: Jeremy P.Tarcher, Inc., 1989 (2ndedition/reprint of 1976 edition). (TOS-2) DW: “This is perhaps the only book onGurdjieff that tells you what to dorather than relating a history of the movement. If you are really interested inthese techniques, you might look forlocal Gurdjieff/Ouspensky centers; initiation works better when practiced ratherthan merely read about. But, asalways, observe the graduates of the school before investing your time, efforts,and funds. The best history of theGurdjieff movemement is James Webb’s The Harmonious Circle.”4P. Persuasions of the Witch’s Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England byT.M. Luhrmann.Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989. (TOS-4) MA: “This is an extremelysophisticated study of the neo-pagan/Wiccan phenomenon by a cultural anthropologist, who went to the extent ofjoining several covens andparticipating personally in their ritual activities. Although it is clear thatLuhrmann retained an ‘academicdetachment’ from the cultures she was investigating, her analysis is remarkablefor being empathetic and non-critical; she seeks to understand and to explain, not to condemn or ridicule.Although Wicca is on an entirelydifferent level from that of the Black Arts, Luhrmann’s observations andconclusions are nonetheless most valuablein helping the aspiring Black Magician to see ways in which the Black Art andScience can be used for social/culturalneeds common to humans generally. Probably the most insightful study of Wiccayet published.”4Q. Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches: The Riddle of Culture by Marvin Harris. NY:Random House 1974,Vintage Books 1978 (paperback). (TOS-3) Patty Hardy IV°: “This is a functionalanalysis of food taboos, infanticide,ritualized warfare, messianic cults, and witchcraft crazes. More than ananthropological study of bad craziness, itwill alert the Initiate to delusional elements in modern life.

From these elements, art and politicsfashion the collective dreamwork whosefunction it is to prevent people from understanding what their social life isall about.’ Harris taught anthropology atColumbia University and held the Chair of the Department of Anthropology from1963 to 1966.”4R.

It is also the one with the ‘If theDevil lives anywhere, it could be in SanFrancisco’ comment. Michael and Lilith Aquino are interviewed, clips of AntonLaVey from Satanis are shown, andfrom there the film goes downhill.

A lot of time iswasted on snipe-hunt theories about Atlantis actually being Crete or Santorini,presuming that Plato (who traveledabout the Mediterranean Sea) was too stupid to know the difference between theMediterranean and the AtlanticOcean.”5E.

Muck, a German scientist who contributed to the invention ofthe schnorkel and V1/V2 rockets ofWorld War II, concludes: ‘The Mayan temple records and modern methods ofhistorical dating agree.

[Deutschland: DieAtlanter-Volk aus dem Bernsteinland. Grabert Verlag, Tübingen, 1985.] (TOS-4)(TRP-1) MA: “This is a ratherdeceptive work. Although published as a book in 1979, it is a revised andexpanded treatment of the author’s earlierwork Atlantis (1965). But as you examine the dates in the footnotes and the16-page bibliography, it begins to dawn- 186 -on you that Spanuth has taken massive amounts of material from the archives ofthe prehistorical research elementsof the Ahnenerbe-SS [see #14M]. In fact it is rather amusing to see how‘startling’ everyone finds this book - asthough this is all ‘breakthrough revelation’ in archæology. It is more correctlythe unveiling of source material thathas lain under an emotional and political taboo since 1945. To be fair toSpanuth, he has done a good job ofintegrating and analyzing an enormous amount of data whose processing under theNazi regime was inhibited by (a)wartime pressures and (b) the ideological constraints of Nazi politics.Spanuth’s thesis is that the royal island ofAtlantis (Basileia) was located in the area of Heligoland, and that the Platonicaccounts of Atlantean history areessentially accurate. He - and the Ahnenerbe - make a good case.”5I. Plato, Prehistorian: 10000-5000 B.C. Myth, Religion, and Archæology by MarySettegast. Cambridge:The Rotenberg Press, 1986. (TOS-3) DW: “There’s a more recent trade paperback ofthis book from LindisfarnePress.

Forbidden Archæology: The Hidden History of the Human Race by Michael Cremoand RichardThompson. San Diego: Bhaktivedanta Institute, 1993. ISBN: 0-9635309-8-4. (TOS-4)MA: “A gigantic compendiumof all sorts of ‘inconvenient’ archæological data that conventional archæologyhas preferred to ignore or ‘fast-forward’ through. At the end of this tome the authors blithely propose thesignificance of this data: that ‘beingsresembling anatomically-modern humans were present in the Early Pleistocene (1.7million years ago) and Pliocene(3.5 million years ago)’. Furiously denounced by conventional archæologists [seeScroll of Set, April 1996], this bookstill, well, exists unrefuted.

Atlantis, The Lost Continent. MA: “Despite the power of the Atlantislegend, it has not been an object ofmuch interest by filmmakers. One exception was this 1960s-vintage fantasy filmby George Pal. Beginning the filmwith a recitation of ‘Atlantis-proofs’ from #5A, Pal set his Atlantis in thetime of Classical Greece and decorated itwith Nautilus-like submarines, crystalline death-rays, and mad-labs in appliedlycanthropy.

This bias against Satanism assomething “necessarilycriminal” will be evident in some of the following accounts, and it frequentlyresulted in persecutionthat drove Satanists even farther from the social mainstream. In 1966 CE (theyear I of the Æon of Set)Anton Szandor LaVey founded the Church of Satan, an institution designed totranslate the philosophyof Satanism into a socially- acceptable form. In 1975 the Church of Satanevolved into the Temple of Set,at which time the philosophical inconsistencies and anti-Judaic/Christianorientation of the olderorganization were eliminated. The Black Art has now been raised to its highestform.6A. La-Bas ( Down There) by J.K. Huysmans. NY: Dover Publications, 1972.[Deutschland: Tief unten.Diogenes Taschenbuchverlag, CH-Zürich, 1987.] (TOS-3) MA: “This is the classicof late 19th-century FrenchSatanism. It contains detailed accounts of the old 17th-century Black Mass aslater practiced in ‘underground’ Paris.The book evidences a strong Christian moral bias; hence it is historicallyunreliable. Nevertheless it became a modelfor subsequent efforts at anti-Christian ceremonies. ‘Devil-worship’ sequencesfrom most contemporary films, forexample, can be recognized as variations on the La-Bas account.

A Razor for a Goat by Elliot Rose. Toronto: University of Toronto Press,1962. (TOS-3) MA: “This bookwas begun as a good-humored effort to debunk the neo-witchcraft theories ofMargaret Murray and Gerald Gardner[which it does rather conclusively]. Rose went a good deal further andstraightened out many misconceptionsconcerning medieval witchcraft accounts as well. Yet he argues for the essentialvalue of the concepts of ‘pure’Satanism. This was another book of prime importance to the original design ofthe Church of Satan, and it helps toexplain the strong anti-neopagan/Wiccan attitude of that institution. It sayssomething for popular tastes [and thememory of P.T. Barnum] that Wiccan literature continues to flourish while #6C isusually found only in universitylibraries.”6D. Seven Footprints to Satan by A. Merritt. NY: Avon Books #28209, 1942[reprinted 1976]. (TOS-5)(LVT-5) MA: “Written ca. 1928, this novel contains many passages describing thecentral philosophies of Satanism,as well as many episodes exemplifying them. Since the book was ostensiblyfiction, Merritt did not have to mincewords. Harmless to non-Initiates, it is a Satanic manifesto for Adepts of theLeft-Hand Path. And the character of‘Satan’ in the story bears a remarkable resemblance to Anton Szandor LaVey ...in more than one way.” JL: “Theimage of ‘Satan’ in #6D is very like that of Anton LaVey during I-X AES. Hisexpertise as a magician surpasses evenAyesha’s best efforts and is more believable because of the novel’s contemporarysetting. Although he uses highlysophisticated LBM exclusively, his designs far exceed the grasp of the otherplayers who, despite their efforts,continue dancing to the tune played by ‘Satan’ almost to the end. #6D portrays aworld in which the present andfuture are both controlled with admirable precision. The acts of theft andviolence in #6D may be deplorable, but wecan admire the mind which created and mastered a universe designed for itsexclusive pleasure.”6E.

(TOS-4) MA:“The creative aspects of Satanism are beautifully portrayed in Paradise Lost,and this edition has the addedattraction of extensive notes by the brilliant and witty Asimov. [Missing,sadly, are the famous Dore illustrations,which enthusiasts will have to seek in other editions.] Milton, who lived andwrote during the CromwellianCommonwealth, observed due subtlety in his portrayal of the virtues of Satan andthe vices of YHVH.

Althoughpersonally a skeptic, Seabrook admitted thepsychological effectiveness of witchcraft. He was among the close friends ofAleister Crowley at the time of thelatter’s attainment of the grade of Magus.

(TOS-4) MA: “Anovel of an arrogant/selfish/ sensitive/intellectual British schoolteacher whobecomes enmeshed in the schemes ofa modern magician. An excellent illustration of the use of psychological magicas a control device [as opposed to amere research tool]. The characters of Nicholas (the schoolteacher) and Conchis(the magus) exemplify aspects ofthe Nemo and Aristos, principles in Fowles’ own brand of existentialism as setforth in his incisive theoretical workThe Aristos (NY: Signet Books #Q4280, 1964). Fowles describes the revisededition of The Magus as less fantastic/more realistic than the original edition, but after several readings ofcomparing the two I am inclined to favor therevised edition as a richer experience from which the magic has definitely notbeen excised. The Magus is one ofthose books whose every re-reading brings new impressions and adventures. I wasstrongly tempted to rate itTOS-1, but feel that greatest benefit will be derived from a reading of it whenthe Setian has first mastered the basicsof the included philosophical concepts and of Lesser Black Magic.

Putnam’s Sons, 1975.(TOS-3) MA: “While preparing#4C and editing #4E, Cavendish was intrigued by certain recurring themesrelative to the notion of ‘evil’ in cross-cultural contexts involving death, darkness, sex, disorder, etc. This book ishis effort, as an acknowledged skepticand agnostic, to deal with these themes. The result is not a full survey of thephilosophy and theology of ‘evil’, but itis a good introduction. The book’s defect is that Cavendish, as a consequence ofhis detachment, is forced to relyupon second-hand sources for his data and so can only report others’ directimpressions [which can be somewhatless than objective]. Much of the book’s 300 pages are weighted down with theusual, tiresome collection of occultanecdotes and mythological stories.”6K. The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey.

(COS-1) (TOS-3) (TRP-1) (LVT-1) MA: “This booksummarizes the social and magicalphilosophy of the Church of Satan at the time of its writing, but it is not acompendium of all C/S doctrines ofsubsequent years.

Justas Ipsissimus Crowley was faced with opposition from the momentum from the Æonof Osiris, Magus LaVey boldlyconfronted society with a Church in honor of the Devil. Without the dramaticimpact of the Age of Satan, the Æon ofSet would have been longer coming into being.” DW: “This book is one of the mosteffective workings in the English-speaking world. It set up the path of Satanic initiation, which utilizes theforces of the world as the resistancenecessary for the individual to gain power. It was designed to produce a solve,a dissolving of the world. As such itwill remain a powerful force in the world; as long as there are 17-year-olds, itwill be in print. It failed to provide anew vision directly, but it is the nature of works of destruction that theycarry the seeds of a new creation. The Æonof Set is that creation. This book isn’t here for inspiration, but as a model ofhow to shake things up, if that is whatyou want to do. But you’ll have to come up with a new figure to shake things upwith: Satan now sells T-shirts andmusic albums.”6L. The Satanic Rituals by Anton Szandor LaVey.

Rituals of any religion are an expression of the magical andphilosophical trends of the host society.”DW: “A good source of ritual texts to be reworked and redesigned in a Setiancontext. Of particular importance are:(1) the ‘ Vorspiele’, which demonstrates that the laws of consciousness evolvethrough time and culture - an excellentreworking of the Eighth Precept of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus;(2) the ‘Ceremony of the NineAngles’, which demonstrates the GBM principle that one may attain inner psychicorder, the existence of the Xeperof mankind’s most noble heritage [If they did it, I can do it.]; and (3) the‘Adult Satanic Baptism’, which establishescontrol of the psyche as the key to power.”6M.

The book brings out the impressivescope of LaVey’s exposure to theart, history, and institutions of occultism and to many colorful personalitieson the fringe of contemporary society.Unfortunately the book is also extremely propagandistic, advancing many ‘facts’which are either questionable orknown to be false - for example the chapter recounting a supposed LaVey/MarilynMonroe affair, and the finalchapter with several distortions concerning the post-III Church of Satan.Moreover the personality profiles areunrepresentative of the mainstream of post-III Satanists both within and withoutthe San Francisco area. Specificdetails may be checked with III°+ officials, or with any II°+ Setian owning acopy of #6N. An interesting photosection is included in #6M. Burton Wolfe also wrote another book which is ofinterest, if only as a curiosity, tocollectors of C/S memorabilia: The Devil and Dr. Noxin (San Francisco: Wild WestPublishing House, 1973).

Ritual sequences and philosophical principles fromthe 1966-68 Church of Satan areincluded as a running theme throughout the play, and are favorably/seriouslytreated. Oddly enough The Devil andDr. Noxin was not publicized nor promoted by LaVey at the time of itspublication or, as far as I know, thereafter.”JL: “Taken with a large grain of salt because of the self-serving exaggerationsand inaccuracies, this colorful portraitof Anton LaVey nonetheless illustrates the first steps that he and others aroundhim took ca. 1966-68 towardsdeveloping the Church and Age of Satan.”6N. The Church of Satan by Michael A. Aquino. San Francisco: CreateSpace, 2013.(TOS-3) (TRP-3) (LVT-1)MA: “As a religious institution consecrated by and literally acknowledging thePrince of Darkness, the Church ofSatan enjoyed an inspiring, and occasionally either thrilling or terrifying,existence from 1966 to 1975. Beginning asa whimsical and satirical countercultural statement against the social andinstitutionally-religious hypocrisy of the1960s, the Church of Satan proceeded to evolve into a positive, sincere, and [toits own surprise] virtuousorganization, though not without periodic individual and group growing pains:the consequence of allegiance to asupernatural entity only dimly apprehended and understood by WesternJudæo-Christianized civilization. From its1979 1st Edition to this 2013 8th, The Church of Satan remains the only completedocumentary history of thatfascinating and bizarre adventure, from Anton & Diane LaVey’s founding of theChurch in their San Francisco hometo its surprising dissolution into a secular business a decade later andmetaphysical supersession by the Temple ofSet.

In 1988 thisbook was extensively revised,expanded, updated, and republished (NY: Mysterious Press) under the title SatanWants You: The Cult of DevilWorship in America. New chapters analyze and expose the ‘criminal Satanism’scare of the 1980s. The new edition’sonly drawback is that Lyons, apparently out of personal devotion to Anton LaVey,significantly misrepresents thecrisis of 1975 in the Church of Satan and portrays that institution ascontinuing unabated. In a similar vein hedistorts the origins and post-1975 development of the Temple of Set. Lyonscorrected some of the more blatanterrors in the subsequent paperback edition of this book by the same publisher,but the LaVey-obsequiousnesscontinues.

He was also a behind-the-scenes manipulator of politics [towards war] and a British knight. Though neverincluded on a Church of Satanreading list, this book was the primary source of Anton LaVey’s fascination withZaharoff as a skilled, MachiavellianLesser Magician. LaVey also admired Zaharoff’s Howard Hughes-like avoidance ofpublic scrutiny - to the point ofdeliberate sabotage of records concerning him.

While thepublic was quick to brand CharlesManson a ‘Satanist’, his own Family considered him Jesus Christ. In a sense thatneither the public nor his Familyunderstood, perhaps he was [and is] a Satanist. To prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi,Manson’s ‘evil’ was easy to identify& condemn. This book is by no means an apology for Manson; if anything, itpaints him in even more horrific colorsthan Helter Skelter. But the picture also emerges of a far more complexindividual than generally seen by the public.In 1989 this book was reissued by Signet (ISBN 0-451-16563-2). Although thereare five new chapters updating thehistory of the Mansonites, this new edition also omits an entire chapter on theinfamous ‘Solar Lodge of the O.T.O.’as well as several references to the O.T.O. and the Process.

Boston: Richard G.Badger/The Gorham Press, 1919. (TOS-3) MA: “This rare little book was AntonLaVey’s source for the Yezidi sectionof #6L, including the ritual texts quoted. As noted in #6N, Joseph bases theserituals and his own conclusions uponan ‘Arabic manuscript presented to me by my friend Daud as-Saig ... a man ofculture, in sympathy with westernthought, etc.’ When Joseph’s book was assessed in 1967 by Royal Asiatic Societyanthropologist C.J. Edmonds, henoted that it remained unauthenticated. Fellow R.A.S. scholar Alphonso Minganaconsidered the ritual texts offeredby Joseph as simple forgeries, based upon Mingana’s analysis of their grammar &syntax. These evaluations andobjections were apparently unknown to [or ignored by] Anton LaVey when heincluded the Joseph material in #6L.The Temple of Set’s texts of the Yezidi rituals in question are included asappendices to #6N, and are based uponcurrent doctoral papers at the University of California, Los Angeles, obtainedthrough the Anthropology Library atUC Berkeley. The UCLA papers reveal Joseph’s account and analysis to beincomplete and factually suspect. ForYezidi culture, your best starting point is #6AB.”6AB. A Pilgrimage to Lalish by C.J. Edmonds. London: Royal Asiatic Society ofGreat Britain and Ireland,1967. (TOS-3) MA: “This small, concisely-written book remains the most coherentand reliable published bookconcerning Yezidi culture to date. It does not contain any of the Yezidireligious or magical texts, however. Theauthentic text of the Yezidi Book of the Revelation [corrected and expanded fromthe Joseph version contained in#6L] is reprinted as Appendix 65 of #6N. The other principal Yezidi text, theMashaf-a Resh ( Black Scripture), isnot reprinted in #6N because of its length, but a copy is available in thearchives of the Temple of Set.”6AC. Dashwood: The Man and the Myth by Eric Towers. London: Crucible (AquarianPress/ThorsonsPublishing Group, 1986. (TOS-4) MA: “This is the definitive account of SirFrancis Dashwood and his MedmenhamAbbey, complete with extensive photo sections. This continues and reinforces thethesis of #6T, offering evidencethat Dashwood’s ‘occult’ activities consisted largely of revels in honor ofApollo and Bacchus in West WycombePark, with the only possible Satanic element being hearsay rumors about a‘closed room/chapel’ in Dashwood’sAbbey. This room was reputed to be accessible only to the ‘monks’ of Dashwood’sgroup, and to be decorated withobscene/ blasphemous pictures. If, so, the decor was removed later, for theAbbey today shows no trace of it in anyroom. An interesting side-note is that the Dashwood group never called itselfthe ‘Hellfire Club’. That nameactually belonged to a club of libertines formed in London many years earlier(1719) by the Duke of Wharton, whichbecame so scandalous that the crown shut it down with a proclamation denouncing‘certain scandalous clubs orsocieties of young persons who meet together, and in the most impious andblasphemous manner insult the most- 192 -sacred principles of our Holy Religion, affront Almighty God himself, andcorrupt the minds and morals of oneanother’. By contrast the frolics at West Wycombe seem to have been rather lessextreme. Towers’ book includes aninteresting discussion of how rumors about Dashwood’s doings multiplied over thecenturies until it was taken forgranted that he presided over every kind of depravity at Medmenham, to includeDennis Wheatley-style BlackMasses. Over the main entrance to Medmenham can still be seen the inscriptionFAY CE QUE VOUDRAS from Dr.Francois Rabelais’ ‘Abbey of Theleme’ in his novel Gargantua, which AleisterCrowley would later borrow for his‘Do What Thou Wilt’ Law and for his own Abbey in Sicily.”6AD. Satan’s Power: A Deviant Psychotherapy Cult by William Sims Bainbridge.Berkeley: University ofCalifornia Press, 1978. (TOS-4) MA: “The definitive account of the ‘ProcessChurch of the Final Judgment’, a quasi-Satanic movement that existed in the late 1960s-early 1970s. It was more theproduct of the ‘Jesus Freak’atmosphere of the time than of authentic Satanism, as it was a ‘hippie’ religionthat acknowledged four deities -Jehovah, Christ, Satan, and Lucifer - in a complementary relationship.Predictably it was the ‘Satanic’ component ofthe Process that attracted the most attention - from aspirants and externalcritics alike - and the Process provedunable to come to grips with this symbolism and its implications. Bainbridgeshows how the organization waserroneously linked to the Manson Family in Sanders’ The Family (#6U), and howits failure to successfully disputeand reject this linkage resulted in the breakdown and eventual dissolution ofthe group. Theologically/philosophically the Process was ignorant of Satanism, so the primary value ofthis account is as an account of thedangers faced by an unskilled group perceived by society as ‘Satanic’ in theconventional/evil sense.

(TOS-4) DW: “Thisvolume, third in a recommended trilogy of The Myth of the Magus and RitualMagic, deals with the Faust legend, aChristianized Remanifestation of the Odhinn’s ‘sacrifice of himself to himself’- in other words, making a deal with- 193 -your own psyche, which under the anti- psyche mode of monotheism became‘Satanic’. Dealing with figures of DonJuan and Faust, Butler shows how the pagan concept of the magus endured andappealed to artists - an archetypewhich could not and cannot be banished.”6AK.

This isno mere recitation or catalogue, asSchreck (a Magister Templi IV° of the Temple of Set at the time of publishing)possesses both the initiatoryperspective and the film-world experience to bring out not just the entertainingand horrific aspects of each movie,but its [intentional or accidental] philosophical and magical power as well.Mention must also be made of Schreck’swriting style, which is elegant-yet-slashing in the tradition of the Æsthetesand Decadents.”6AL.

The Devil’s Rain. 1975. MA: “In 1974 CE Robert Fuest, who directed the Dr.Phibes films, decided to filma horror movie with Satanism as its theme. He took an anemic novel aboutWiccan-witchcraft in New England andhired Anton LaVey as technical advisor to spice it up, which he did - addingtouches of LaVey artwork, Mexicanextras chanting Enochian Keys, and ‘Satanic Priest’ Ernest Borgnine intoningextracts from the invocation in my‘Ceremony of the Nine Angles’ in #6L. The setting was moved to Durango, Mexico(‘Redstone’), and the colorful castincluded Ida Lupino, William Shater [just before the Star Trek movie revival],John Travolta [his screen debut - afight & fall downstairs], and cameos for Anton (a gold-helmeted Priest) andDiane (Borgnine’s colonial-era wife)LaVey.

Asylum of Satan. 1975. Charles Kissinger, Carla Borelli. MA: DVD:“Something Weird Video”#ID1598SWDVD. “Around 1971CE, when I was Priest III° of the C/S Nineveh Grottoin Louisville, Kentucky, a localcommercial film company decided to try for the big time by making a Satanichorror movie - using local theatricaltalent. Since they had a Church of Satan in town, they asked us if we wouldhandle the ritual scene. I wrote thescript, Nineveh designed the chamber, and we imported the Rosemary’s Babydevil-suit [with a new head] fromHollywood. The result of all this was a turkey of a movie with, if I say so, arather zesty ritual sequence.

The Devil Rides Out. Hammer Films, 1968. Screenplay by Richard Matheson.Director: Terence Fisher.Christopher Lee. (LVT-2) MA: “Probably one of the best Hammer films ever made -now available in a HammerCollection videocassette. It is a very accurate screenplay of Dennis Wheatley’sfirst and most famous Satanism novel.Look for Charles Gray’s silky-evil portrayal of Mocata, the character whomWheatley specifically modeled afterAleister Crowley, an acquaintance of his. [One other Wheatley Satanism novel, Tothe Devil a Daughter, was alsomade into a film, but it is a ghastly mess which bears no comparison to thebook. Wheatley’s novels are generallyavailable in British editions, with occasional American publication. Othernovels in his ‘Satanism’ series include TheSatanist, They Used Dark Forces, and The Ka of Gifford Hillary.” JL: “The novelis far better than the movie, butfew can resist taking a look at the cinematographer’s art turned to the subjectof Black Magic. Christopher Lee starsas de Richleau, the rich man’s Indiana Jones, although his IJ exploits arementioned only in passing. Of far moreinterest is Charles Gray’s portrayal of Ipsissimus Mocata, particularly in hisdiscussion of the moral aspects ofMagic. The film also has in its cast Paul Eddington, a British actor who hasturned for the most part to comedy. Itmight have been that DB was a bit too much for him.”F6D. Fade to Black. 1983. Dennis Christopher and Linda Kerridge, Mickey Rourke.Director: VernonZimmerman. MA: “In the flavor of Anger’s Hollywood Babylon books, this is ahorror movie about a young, alientedfilm buff, Eric Binford, who, in a different application of lycanthropy, assumesvarious characters from classic filmsto give himself ‘their powers’. Readers of #6N will recognize the parallels tothe 1974+ interests of Anton LaVey, toinclude the presence of Marilyn Monroe as Eric’s ideal woman and ‘death angel’.”- 194 -F6E. Rosemary’s Baby. 1968.

MA: “Thisfilm is so well known tocontemporary Satanists that little need be said. After the smash success of thenovel, Polanski filmed it with virtuallyno modifications whatever.

MA: “After thesuccess of Rosemary’sBaby, Hollywood floundered around trying to capitalize on the Satanism themewith a couple of failures like TheMephisto Waltz. #F6H was the first film to start ‘getting it right’, and it wasthe brainchild of a little-knownproducer/director, L.Q. Jones, who also starred as the sheriff in the film.Strother Martin plays a surprisinglyeffective Satanic Priest.”F6I. The Black Cat. Universal, 1934. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi. MA: “Aremarkable essay in Art Deco/Satanism starring Karloff as the Satanist and Lugosi as hisonly-slightly-less-sinister opponent. The story line,centering on a house modeled after the Ennis-Brown house in Hollywood [see Runes#III-6], has nothing to do withthe Poe version. Included is a stylized Black Mass - about as close as Hollywoodwould come to UFA-expressionism.”F6J. The Magus. ca. 1968. Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn, Candice Bergen, AnnaKarina. Director: GuyGreen. Screenplay by John Fowles. MA: “The Magus, like Lord of the Rings, is oneof those novels which is so subtleand complex that you have to read it about 2-3 times before you really begin toabsorb it. The film was an excellenttranslation of the book to the screen - but only for persons who had previouslydigested the book. To a first-timeviewer it was dreadfully confusing. Nevertheless, if you have read the book, thefilm is a fine set of illustrations toaccompany it. Perfectly cast, with Quinn as Conchis, Caine as Nicholas, andBergen as Lily/Julie.

In contrast to thesanitized image portrayed by AugustDerleth, de Camp covers all aspects of HPL’s personality, socially-acceptableand otherwise. Consequently thisbiography has been criticized by some HPL fans who want to see their idolexemplify and reinforce their own socialideologies.

The magicalphilosophies and techniques illustrated herein were experimented with by theChurch of Satan and are currentlyapplied effectively by the Temple of Set.” JL: “The LVT places Lovecraft’s worksin the ‘5’ category not because weworry that anyone might inadvertently move his lips while reading, but becausethe rites and gods of HPL can bemisused through misinterpretation.

This Bantamedition contains a preface by Wilson explaining this. Other novels in the seriesinclude #19A and The SpaceVampires (sequel to Parasites - later made into the science-fiction movieLifeforce - which in my opinion is moreinteresting than the Space Vampires novel).”- 196 -7F. Selected Letters of H.P. Lovecraft, Volume V. Sauk City: Arkham House, 1976.(TOS-4) MA: “The fifth andfinal volume in this Letters series, this one is recommended because itencompasses the period 1934-37, whenHPL’s personal philosophy had reached its greatest maturity and complexity. Manyof the letters are far morerevealing of his thought than are even the most ambitious of his stories. ArkhamHouse [and various paperbacklicensees] make a deliberate effort to keep the #7B books more or lesscontinuously in print, but other Arkhamworks, such as the HPL Letters series, tend to be limited editions, infrequentlyreprinted if at all.

HPL treated a related theme in his The Shadow OverInnsmouth, but the only horror to befound in Federbush’s account comes from the savagery of the surface world andits inhabitants. This is not asuperficial novel, but one which looks carefully into human anatomy andoceanography. A powerful ‘geneticmemory’ statement, it ranks with #7C and #22G as a magical text. An excellentnon-fictional bibliography isappended for those who wish to pursue this area further.” JL: “Federbush’s manof the sea is a magician who focuseshis Art towards the central aim of Magic: the control of one’s life and theuniverse impacting upon it.

It is important to note that the literature in this categoryis selected not for its storyvalue, but for its in-depth treatment of these phenomena. Here may be found someof the most ancientand essential instincts and intelligent dispositions of the soul - qualitiesamong the first to be challengedand ostracized by profane society because of its brutish fear of such godlikeprerogatives. Because of thesuperstitious taboo which has lain over them for so many centuries, it is widelyassumed by profanesociety that vampirism and lycanthropy are mere myths, playthings formonster-movies. They are not.8A. The Vampire Papers by Bernhardt J. Hurwood (Original title: Terror by Night,later released as TheMonstrous Undead). NY: Pinnacle Books #523-00975-5, 1976. (TOS-3) MA: “Unlikethe werewolf or vampiresections of most occult anthologies, this book focuses directly on the sexualand psychopathic bases of botharchetypes.

A short but informativebibliography is appended. [See also #8I.] Books dealing exclusively withsubjects such as necrophilia [sample title:The Love of the Dead (!)] were evaluated for this reading list but rejected asbeing mere attempts to pander todegenerate and morbid tastes. #8A relates such themes to the more significantprecepts addressed by this readinglist category.”8B.

NY: Philosophical Library, 1951 (republishedSanta Barbara: Ross-Erikson, Inc., 1978). (COS-4) (TOS-4) MA: “Highly regarded by Anton LaVey as apsychological analysis oflycanthropy, this work is an anthropologically-based treatment of sadism,masochism, and lycanthropy in the formof a 30-page lecture and 233 (!) pages of footnotes to that lecture. The issueis whether man is inherently savage orwhether he imitated savagery from other species and hence has the prerogative torid himself of it.

(TOS-3) MA:“Hurwood (author of #8A)produced this as a ‘coffee-table’ book on vampires - bits and pieces ofinteresting information concerning vampirismin general. It is less analytical and psychological than #8A, while at the sametime being more story-, movie-, andlegend-oriented. Included are an extensive bibliography, an indexed listing ofall films on the theme of vampirism,and even a directory of vampire-related organizations.”8J. Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice. NY: Ballantine Books, 1976. (VAM-1)(LVT-3) Robertt NeillyIV°: “Though IV has an excellent story line, its real value consists of itsexamples of vampiric/human characteristicsthought to be hidden from view. The story is told from the vampire’sperspective, and addresses many aspects of the‘ancient & essential instincts’ discussed in the preamble to this category. Thenovel also explores goals for those whowould tap the mind’s potential. Described is the process of transformation &transmutation from human to vampire,together with the experience of surviving death via the Will.” J. Lewis VI°:“Anne Rice’s vampires are beingsoperating generally at a highest and best level, although the human creeps inagain and again.

(TOS-3)(VAM-3) D&RW: “This tidylittle 150-page survey covers both non-film vampire legends and the various waysin which vampiric themes havebeen treated in film. A very useful addendum to the book is an extensive list ofnovels and short stories dealing withthe subject of vampirism.

Isabell Adjani, Klaus Kinski.Director: Werner Herzog. Music:Popol Vuh. MA: “There are scores, perhaps now hundreds of Dracula-theme moviesin existence. This remake of theoriginal Murnau Nosferatu is recommended not because Kinski makes ashudderingly-ugly Dracula, but becausethe film so eerily illustrates the not-living/not-dead phantom realm of theclassical vampire, and the ‘atmosphere’which accompanies him. See #8L for a strong discussion of the symbolism in thetwo Nosferatu films. Whenoriginally tested in the United States, this French/German film had Englishvoice-overs. When finally released, itwas in German with English subtitles, which prevents the audience from beingabsorbed into its scenes. Too bad!There are ‘French’ and ‘German’ editions of the soundtrack album by Popol Vuh.”- 200 -F8E. Blood for Dracula. Andy Warhol/Paul Morrissey. Udo Kier, Joe Dallesandro.MA: “If you think you’veseen all the Dracula variations there are to see, try this one: This Dracula(Kier) can only drink the blood of virgins.A frantic comedy ensues in his desperate quest to find one. The high point isreached when the sullen Dallesandro, astaple in Warhol/Morrissey films, seduces the only virgin daughter in theItalian family being stalked by the count.When caught in the act by the girl’s understandably indignant mother,Dallesandro retorts, ‘I’m saving her from avampire’ - probably the most unusual excuse yet offered. Very explicitly sexual,very gory, and very funny.”F8F. Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Columbia, 1992. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.Gary Oldman, WinonaRyder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves. MA: “The most magnificent Dracula everfilmed. Winner of 3 Academyawards. Stunning costumes by Eiko Ishioka. A romantic epic of titanic scope andsensitivity - only incidentally a‘horror movie’. Watch for effects such as the semi-independent movements ofDracula’s shadow in his castle - acharming variation on the legend that vampires cast no shadow.”F8G. Shadow of the Vampire. Universal, 2001. MA: “Willem Dafoe steals this showas Max Schreck in thisfilm about the making of the original Murnau Nosferatu - the twist being thatSchreck is really a vampire. Dafoe -who received an Oscar nomination for this role - intimidates his fellowcastmembers, and Murnau (John Malkovich)as least as much as the audience. Watch for Udo Kier as the director’slong-suffering associate.”F8H. [John Carpenter’s] Vampires. Columbia Pictures, 1998. MA: “‘When I find thebastard, I’m going toshove a stake up his ass,’ growls vampire-hunter James Woods, and that prettymuch sets the tone for this brutal,hardboiled, vampires-vs.-humans yarn set in the modern American west. As isoften Carpenter’s whim, he does thesoundtrack with his own band, the Texas Toad Lickers: a sledgehammer of a scorethat is well-worth picking up as aCD on its own.”- 201 -Category 9: The Æon of HorusDas Äon von Horusas of February 26, 2003In 1904 CE the British magician Aleister Crowley - the self-acknowledged Beast666 - proclaimedthe Æon of Horus, an initiatory climate characterized by actualization of themost refined sense of thehuman Will towards conscious unification with the Universe. This was a majoradvance in thecoherence and evolution of occultism, comprising the most sophisticated basisfor initiation until 1966CE and the advent of the Æon of Set.In his writings, Crowley sought to integrate what had previously been ahaphazard collection ofmedieval superstition and ancient paganism into a legitimate magical philosophy.He was more or lesssuccessful, but his works are so complex - requiring for their understanding anextensive background inphilosophy, occultism, comparative religious mythology, and world culturalhistory - that it remainsopen to question how many [if any] of his present-day disciples can be said totruly possess and applythe extremely rigorous magical skills he sought to codify and communicate. Thatthere are numerous“Aleister Crowley fan clubs” is undeniable. Whether any of them would havegained his personalendorsement as a legitimate embodiment of the Silver Star (A.'.A.'.) or OrdoTempli Orientis (O.T.O.) ashe originally conceived them to be is an issue that cannot be resolved byargument, decree, or civil law -but only by the test of time. At this time there is no legitimate A.'.A.'. inevidence. There are only twoO.T.O. organizations with meaningful claims to legitimacy: TheCalifornia-incorporated/New York-headquartered O.T.O. (the “McMurtry” or “Caliphate” O.T.O. - which is recognizedas the O.T.O. underU.S. law) and the “Metzger” O.T.O. in Switzerland. The Temple of Set recognizesand enjoys cordialrelations with the U.S. O.T.O.; we have had no contact with the Swissorganization. We do not recognizethe credentials of any group claiming to be the A.'.A.'..The Book of Coming Forth by Night establishes the Temple of Set’s interest inand responsibilityto the Crowley legacy. Because of the continuing and highly-emotionalcontroversies over Crowleyorganizations, concepts, and successors, we have thought it best to allow waterto seek its own level overa period of time, concentrating our Crowley-related efforts towards meaningfuland serious discussionand application of Æon of Horus principles as they may complement and enhancethose of the Æon ofSet. The books cited below represent only part of the entire corpus of Crowleyliterature. While theTemple’s archives include virtually the “complete Crowley”, many books by/abouthim containoverlapping/ reprinted material ... and/or confuse more than they clarify. SomeCrowley-related books -most conspicuously those by Kenneth Grant and Marcelo Motta - contain severedistortions ofCrowley’s original concepts and are not recommended accordingly. If you want togo Crowley-hunting,the books listed in this category ought to be the most informative andrewarding.9A. The Great Beast by John Symonds. London: Macdonald, 1971 [Weiser paperbackedition available].[Deutschland: Das Tier 666, Sphinx Verlag, CH-Basel, 1983] (TOS-3) (LVT-1) MA:“This remains the mostcomprehensive and objective biography of Crowley. The 1971 Second Edition isexpanded and updated from theoriginal 1951 First Edition. #9A has been criticized for describing certainepisodes of Crowley’s life in a scornful andcondescending light, but it would be more accurate to say that a description ofhis behavior without attention to hismagical motives for such behavior is misleading. #9B and #9C in particularreveal these motives. So complexwere Crowley’s life and works, however, that any attempt to understand otherworks in this category without firsthaving digested #9A will result in confusion.” J. Lewis VI°: “The Work of theMagus of the Æon of HarWer is one ofthe invaluable legacies passed down to Setians, who have the benefit ofhistorical perspective. Understanding theWord Thelema is an essential step along the path of Initiation.”9B. The Eye in the Triangle by Francis I. Regardie. St. Paul: LlewellynPublications, 1970. (TOS-3) MA:“Regardie worked with Crowley for many years as his personal secretary. Althoughthe two became estranged in1937, Regardie went on to edit and publish a number of Crowley’s major works,including #9D, #9F, #9H, and #9I.More than any direct testimony could establish, Regardie’s sensitivity and skillat such editing established him asthe single most reliable authority on Crowley. #9B is more of a portrait than abiography, although it was written inpart as a protest against the bias Regardie felt to be present in #9A. [WhileRegardie did not recognize the Church ofSatan, he did enjoy pleasant and cooperative relations with the Temple of Setand myself from 1975 to his death in1985. It was he, incidentally, who put the Temple in touch with the CaliforniaO.T.O.]”9C. The Confessions of Aleister Crowley by Aleister Crowley (Ed. Symonds &Grant). NY: Hill & Wang, 1969.[Deutschland: Confessions - Die Bekenntnisse des Aleister Crowley (2 Bände),Johanna Bohmeier Verlag, Bergenan d. Dumme, 1986] (TOS-4) (LVT-4) MA: “Crowley’s autobiography - elegantlywritten, with a treasure-house ofhis magical philosophy to be found along the way. While it adds the missingmotives to most of the unflattering- 202 -episodes cited in #9A, #9C probably ignores or minimizes events that Crowleydisliked recalling. All thingsconsidered, the picture of the Beast that emerges from this work is that of afar more sensitive and principledindividual than his media reputation suggests. One suspects that Crowley indeedsuffered from the Curse of a Magus(not to be understood, much less Understood), and that those who could notu/Understand him lashed out at him toallay their own feelings of frustration and inferiority.” J. Lewis VI°: “Thisfascinating and oversized book is one ofthe best portraying the Task and the Curse of the Magus. DCLXVI reached for theeternal; #9A and Liber Legis tendto question whether he truly attained it. Read and draw your own conclusions.”9D. Magick Without Tears by Aleister Crowley (Ed. Regardie). St. Paul: LlewellynPublications, 1973.[Deutschland: Magie mit/ohne Tränen. Kersken-Canbaz, 2 volumes, ISBNs:3-89423-076-2 & 3-89423-077-0.](TOS-3) (LVT-4) MA: “This is an extensive ‘interview’ with Crowley in the formof a series of his letters [answeringthose of a new student]. Most aspects of his magical philosophy are covered, andthe absence of magical jargonmakes the book relatively easy to understand. Since this exchange of letterstook place rather late in Crowley’smagical career, his discussion of many of his more controversial ideas shows amore reflective approach than inearlier works.” J. Lewis VI°: “#9D is not a book to be taken down for an eveningof easy reading. It calls for anattentive examination, which will show Crowley’s exceptional insights.”9E. Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law by AleisterCrowley (Ed. Symonds &Grant). Montreal: 93 Publishing, 1974. [Deutschland: Liber Al vel Legis mitKommentaren. Kersken-Canbaz, ISBN:3-89423-001-0.] (TOS-4) MA: “In 1912 and again in 1920 Crowley wrote twoextended commentaries on the Bookof the Law, the magical Working through which the Æon of Horus was announced anddefined. Thesecommentaries are consolidated in this beautifully printed book. Its onlyshortcoming consists of an introduction andfootnotes by Kenneth Grant, who attempts therein to twist the Book of the Lawand Crowley’s commentaries intosupports for his own theories and pretensions. The same Crowley commentariesappear in The Law is For All,published by Llewellyn in 1975. In this volume their layout is somewhatconfusing, but there is the advantage of anexcellent introduction and annotation by Regardie. A third volume containing theCrowley commentaries - TheCommentaries of AL, published by Weiser - has been butchered so badly by‘editor’ Motta as to be virtually useless.[See also the section on the Book of the Law, containing the complete text andmy own commentaries to same, inThe Book of Coming Forth by Night: Analysis & Commentary, in the Ruby Tablet ofSet.]”9F. The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O. by Francis King (Ed.). London: C.W. DanielCompany, 1973. (TOS-4) MA:“Distributed in the U.S. by Weiser, this is both a capsule history of theoriginal German and later Crowley versionsof the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the texts of its rituals from 0° to IX° aswritten and/or revised by Crowley. Alsoincluded are several essays of secret ‘instructions’ to the IX° by Crowley. Thisvolume is valuable for the insight itprovides into the innermost initiatory doctrines of the original Crowley O.T.O.It also provides a good introductionto the older German O.T.O., which is the parent organization of virtually allIlluminati/Rosicrucian societiespresently in existence [such as San Jose’s AMORC, whose founder, H. SpencerLewis, received its charter from theO.T.O.’s Theodor Reuss in 1915]. Present-day Illuminated Rosicrucians willprobably be disappointed to discoverthat the enthusiastic sex-magic of the original O.T.O. Illuminatus IX° has beenabandoned in favor of morespiritually uplifting meditation with the ‘Cosmic Masters’. For more informationon the original German O.T.O., see‘German Occult Groups’ in #4E.”9G.

Kersken-Canbaz, ISBN: 3-89423-078-9.] (TOS-4) MA: “Thisseries of books was intended byCrowley as a loosely-organized [not topical or alphabetical] encyclopædia of theA.'.A.'. magical system. Most ofVolume I is exclusively A.'.A.'., but as Crowley lost confidence in the abilityof students to master the A.'.A.'.’sdifficult curriculum - and as he became enthused over the sex-magic/Masonicatmosphere of the O.T.O. - the O.T.O.began to appear as well. Weiser’s 1972 reprint is out-of-print, but a 1994reprint has since appeared from the samepublisher. Since most of #9G’s essential contents may be found in #9H and otherextracted books [there are quite afew Crowley collections which are just selected extracts from #9G], acquisitionof #9G is generally necessary only tothe advanced student of Crowley. Nevertheless it remains unique among magicalsource publications for its size,scope, and sophistication.

Regardie’s- 203 -purpose was to consolidate ‘all the magical writings’ and eliminate theliterary/poetic/dramatic ones, as well asthose by contributors other than Crowley himself. So, from a purelyorganizational/ magical/initiatory standpoint,#9H is the ‘meat’ of #9G. 1,134 pages in length, and about $25.” J. Lewis VI°:“Gems is a reference volume deservinga place in anyone’s magical library. It does not have the OL’s ‘1’ rating, butis worth tracking down for the wealth ofritual, magical rules, and approaches to life it contains.” DW: “Much of thematerial in #9H can be found in on-linearchives maintained by the O.T.O. on the Internet.”9I.

Since thisedition corrects and expands upon earlier editions of 777 and The Qabalah ofAleister Crowley, it is recommendedin place of them. As a point of clarification, Crowley used the term ‘Qabalah’to describe any system of magicalcorrespondences a magician might find personally meaningful or useful. He wasnot a slave to the Hebrew Cabala,though he was fluent with its terminology and was perfectly capable of bendingsame to his purposes as he might beso inclined.”9N.

It is the most tense and intense book that I haveever composed.’ #9O consists of 208paragraphs, each encapsulating some aspect of Crowley’s philosophy. He iscorrect in saying that these summariesare the most ‘intense’ he ever penned; at the same time they are so poetic, socouched in metaphor as to beconfusing and mystifying to the reader who is not familiar with Crowley’smagical jargon. Recommended, like #9K,only after the more elementary books in this category.”9P. The Equinox #III-10 by Hymenæus Beta (William Breeze) (Ed.). NY: ThelemaPublications, 1986. (TOS-3)MA: “Shortly after the McMurtry O.T.O. won its court fight against Marcelo Mottain 1985, it set about to organizethe O.T.O. literature into some kind of coherent whole. This book, released inearly 1986, was intended to be a ‘basic- 204 -collection’ of administrative documents, rituals, and exhortations. To thisextent it is successful, since it makesavailable easily and inexpensively (ca. $15/paperback) many Crowley writings onthe O.T.O. that are otherwiseaccessible only in rare and expensive volumes. Unfortunately, since thiscollection contains only O.T.O.-relatedworks, the novice Crowley student will not be exposed to the crucial A.'.A.'.background to Crowley’s philosophy -nor, for that matter, to a hard-hitting biographical profile of Crowley himself.Also some of the most interestingmagical aspects of the O.T.O. system - the symbolism and structure of itsvarious degrees - are omitted from thiscompendium, presumably to keep them mysterious. [See #9F.] Finally, the historyof the O.T.O. as presented here israther more serene than that of the actual O.T.O.(s) since Crowley’s demise.Although this volume endeavors tocapitalize on the well-known name of the Equinox, its claim to that title isquestionable, since the Equinox wasactually the periodical of the original A.'.A.'., while the Oriflamme was thatof the O.T.O. I would consider the ‘blue’Equinox #III-1 the last of the true Equinoxes [see #9G]. #9P is reviewed moreextensively in Scroll #XII-5/October1986.”9Q. The Magick of Thelema by Don Milo Duquette. York Beach: Weiser, 1993.(TOS-1) DW: “This book hascopies of the major rituals of the system and a useful commentary on them.Duquette has been a practicingThelemite for 20 years, and he discusses Crowley’s system from its initiatoryuse, as well as providing factual andpractical tips on the work. This book clears up a great deal about the A.'.A.'.,Crowley’s death, averse pentagrams,and other matters of interest. Because of its straightforward language andinitiatory applications, I wouldrecommend it highly. The secret of this book is the interrelationships betweenthe rituals and real-life practice ofinitiation.”9R. The Key to it All by David Allen Hulse. St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1993 (twovolumes).

Drawing from the legacy of Eliphas Levi, theTheosophical Society of HelenaBlavatsky, and the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (S.R.I.A.), the Golden Dawnnevertheless succeededin achieving a sophistication and an artistic elegance all its own. While it maybe going too far to saythat it became the prototype for all initiatory orders of this century, itcertainly was the forerunner ofAleister Crowley’s A.'.A.'., and its initiatory grade-structure would influencethose of the Church ofSatan and the Temple of Set.10A.

River Falls: Hazel Hills, 1970 (2volumes, reprinted as 1 volumein 1974 by Llewellyn). (TOS-4) MA: “This is the third edition of the famous andstill definitive study of the G.'.D.'. Itis perhaps the only published work in which the artistry and atmosphere intendedfor the G.'.D.'. are clearly evident,untarnished by bitter accounts of petty personality conflicts. Looking throughthis work, one can see the authenticityand sophistication that the G.'.D.'. projected, which accounted for itsattractiveness to the intelligentsia of a cynicaland restless Victorian England. In spite of this, the G.'.D.'. was crippled by alack of scientific and historicalprecision in its doctrines; this too will be apparent to the reader. Compare,for example, the Enochian Keys with theoriginal Dee manuscript [included in “The Book of Coming Forth by Night:Analysis & Commentary”]. NeverthelessThe Golden Dawn remains a classic - and Regardie’s magnum opus. [Not recommendedis Regardie’s 1984 workThe Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic, which is a confusingly-organizedproduct of a variety of authors,some apparently original/ authentic and others modern/pretenders - mostidentified by initials/mottos only, so thatthe reader cannot easily distinguish between them.]”10C.

[Deutschland: Schwert der Weisheit, Verlag Johanna Bohmeier& Co., Clenze, 1985] (TOS-3)MA: “An account of the G.'.D.'. and its principal figure, Mathers, by a devotedMathers admirer. This bias, togetherwith scant documentation of arguments in the text, makes it necessary to takethis book with a grain of salt. Itsprimary value is as an update and supplement to #10A. The Enochian section isbest ignored as unsubstantiated. Aninteresting feature of the book is the inclusion of G.'.D.'. membership and‘spinoff’ lists, which offer clues to thelegacy of the G.'.D.'. in some later initiatory contexts.”10D.

NY: DoverBooks #23211-5, 1977 (reprinted from the 1932 de Lawrence hardcover edition).[Deutschland: Das Buch derPraktik in der göttlichen Magie, Diederichs Verlag, München] (TOS-4) MA: “In thepristine Golden Dawn thisgrimoire was thought to be particularly ‘dangerous’, but by Setian standards itis merely quaint. Yet it was the textthat inspired Aleister Crowley to begin serious Workings as a magician. Now ofhistorical/collector value only, it is atranslation of a 15th-century manuscript in the Bibliotheque de l’Arsenal inParis. Included is an extensiveintroduction by Mathers.” DW: “This book shows two things very well: (1) Thelaws of consciousness cannot becodified. What works for the Sufi master, the Zen archer, or the magician of thelate Middle Ages will not workstraight off the shelf for you. (2) If you’re about to begin a large, lifetimeproject - such as starting law school - aperiod of intense outer workings beforehand can strengthen the mind/will or, asnon-magicians would say, makeyou lucky.”10E. Eliphas Levi: Master of Occultism by Thomas A. Williams. University ofAlabama Press, 1975. (TOS-3)MA: “Amidst all the confusion surrounding Levi, this little 174-page biographystands as an island of scholarship.Williams discusses the facts of his life, philosophy, and writings succinctly,suggesting prior influences andsubsequent legacies. Today most of Levi’s doctrines are thoroughly outdated, butin many ways he was theColumbus of modern occult science.

NY: Samuel Weiser, 1978.(TOS-3) (LVT-4) MA: “Adocumentary history of the rise and fall of the G.'.D.'. by a historian, not anoccultist with an axe to grind. Hence it isobjective while stopping short of cynicism. This history is based upon variouspersonal and group interactionsamong the membership, not upon the evolution or development of magical theory.The book is valuable as anillustration of the stresses and strains upon an occult order and of how variousindividuals - some well-intentioned,some not - attempted to influence the situation. The ultimate lesson is that anoccult society which becomesobsessed with interpersonal intrigue to the neglect of magic and philosophy ison the path to self-extermination.Howe is also the author of #14W.” J. Lewis VI°: “It gives one pause to thinkthat one day, decades hence, someonewill write a book on the Magicians of the Temple of Set. I think we will be afar more colorful group of personalities,but this is not to say the Golden Dawn members were lacking in activity! #10Fgives readers a deeper insight intothe Æons and Ages.”10G.

Also included is the HermeticLibrary Catalogue of Wynn Westcott, now obsolete but charming for its historicalquaintness.”10H. Yeats and Magic: The Earlier Works by M.C. Flannery. NY: Harper & Row(Barnes & Noble ImportDivision), 1978. (TOS-4) MA: “This is neither as lengthy nor as G.'.D.'.-focusedas #10G, but it is interesting becauseof its explanation of the influences of #19S and Blake [see #6F] in Yeats’magical philosophy. It is also more probingthan #10G, seeking to illustrate Yeats’ personal approach to a magicalphilosophy rather than his dealings with theG.'.D.'. organization.”10I. Egyptian Magic by Florence Farr. Wellingborough, Northamptonshire: TheAquarian Press, 1982.(TOS-4) MA: “The actress Florence Farr was one of the more famous initiates ofthe G.'.D.'. and was a particularlyclose friend of Yeats and G.B. Shaw. This little paperback is a very readablesummary of the Egyptian magicaltradition - as abbreviated as may be expected in 85 pages - but is nonethelessnotable for its section on gnosticChristian philosophy as developed in post-dynastic Egypt. Herein may be foundthe G.'.D.'. roots of the ‘Æonic’system into which Aleister Crowley would propose the Æon of Horus.” DW: “Thisbook is interesting as a historicaltrifle, but if you really want to know what’s going on, look for The Books ofJey and the Untitled Text in the BruceCodex by C.

At that time sorcerers were still subject to being burned at thestake for “dealings with theDevil”; hence Dee was quite careful to lace his magical writings withpro-Christian preambles. He wasalso a cipher expert, keeping many of his personal records in various forms ofcryptical shorthand. In1584 he wrote into his diaries a series of nineteen magical incantations, sinceknown as the Angelical orEnochian Keys. These Keys were regarded as being of high potency for ritualoperations by the GoldenDawn, the A.'.A.'., and the Church of Satan. In the Book of Coming Forth byNight they are revealed as acorruption or approximation of the Word of Set (contained in “The Book of ComingForth by Night:Analysis & Commentary” in the Ruby Tablet of Set).* * *DW: “John Dee is a much used and abused source for most English-languageceremonial magic.What the modern occultnik misses is that the outer workings of a Magus like Deeare the merestfrosting on the cake. His work with Mercator, the British navy, the LBM used onQueen Elizabeth I, thecollecting of books: These things gave him power. Serious magicians should seekto live world-changinglives of mundane excellence if they hope to make Dee’s system speak to them. Ispeculate that Dee’sWord was Regi (Latin: “I will reign.”).”11A. John Dee by Richard Deacon. London: Frederick Muller Ltd, 1967. (TOS-3) MA:“While otherbiographical studies of Dee have been written, none compares with this one forinsight, clarity, and readability.

[Deutschland: WU: 23/5646] (TOS-4) MA: “To date this remains the mostsophisticated study of Dee and hisphilosophy, with detailed chapters on magic, science, religion, Hermetics,applied science, literature, andantiquarianism. An exhaustive bibliography is appended.

John Dee by Charlotte Fell Smith. London: Constable & Company Ltd, 1909.(TOS-3) MA: “This book islighter on the philosophy and heavier on the biography than either #11A or #11B.Hence its greatest value is as across-reference to them.

Berkeley: University ofCalifornia Press, 1978.(TOS-4) MA: “This book is the ‘missing link’ between the metaphysics ofPythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle and Dee’sotherwise-seemingly fantastic magical Workings. It is also the key to Dee’senigmatic ‘hieroglyphic monad’. You willneed to have a basic grounding in higher mathematics, astronomy, and geometrybefore this book will reveal itsessence to you, however.

This is both because sorcerersand sorceressestend to be rather sensual individuals, and because the sexual drives (asdistinct from sex per se) can beused for purposes of ritual magic. Historically Black Magical societies havebeen accused of beingobsessed with sex; a Black Magician might well retort that his/hers is therational & mature approach,and that the critic is suffering from a bad case of Judaic/Christianrepressed/sex neurosis/hysteria. Aproblem with “sex-magic” has been that many practitioners, in an effort toover-compensate for theaforementioned neurosis, have plunged into sex in the most animalistic waypossible - as an indulgencefor its own sake. This, for example, was the presumption of the Church of Satan.Aleister Crowley,however, employed his “sex-magical” practices as a means to attain an ecstaticstate of beingappropriate to an ulterior, conceptualized goal - a fact almost totally lost onhis latter-day disciples, whomore often than not either ignore the sexual component in his Workings or becomeobsessed with it.The Temple of Set proposes an integral, non-compulsive, comfortable, and relaxedinterrelationshipbetween sex, aesthetics, and love - the neglect of any one of which will inhibitthe efficacy of whatevermagical Working is involved.* * *DW: The only commandment here is to know yourself. Whether you choose toovercomeboundaries or practice what you know; whether you choose a lot, a little, ornone; your practice of safe,sane, consensual, adult sexuality must be absolutely and ultimately your own.Let your sense of beauty,which is to say Ma’at, be your guide.13A.

(TOS-3) MA:“A history of sex in religion,valuable primarily as an in-depth supplement to #13A - the main differencesbeing that Goldberg seems a little lessobsessed with the subject, and that there is an interesting section dealing withthe concept of revolt (sexual andotherwise) against repressive religious environments.”13C. Sexuality, Magic, and Perversion by Francis King. Secaucus, New Jersey:Citadel Press, 1971. (TOS-3)MA: “You have to hand it to King for picking a catchy title! Yet this is arather thorough survey of the influence of sexin a number of contemporary cults, religions, and magical societies around theworld - the Wiccan ‘great rite’, theauto/hetero/homosexual magic of the O.T.O. VIII°/IX°/XI°, etc. A good update to#13A and #13B.

It is a goodcrash-course in basic psychology that teaches you how to make people feel trulyunderstood, to build trust, and topersuade through various techniques such as ‘mirroring’, ‘anchoring’, ‘casting aspell’, etc. I have found it verypotent information and accordingly would warn Setians to be careful how they useit - or they may not be able to ridthemselves of the object of their magic.

Dracula. 1979. Frank Langella, Laurence Olivier, Donald Pleasence, KateNelligan. MA: “This film isplaced here rather than in Category #8 because Langella’s interpretation is thatof the vampire-as-lover, andbecause the impact of that interpretation, particularly upon female audienceswho saw this film, proved to beremarkably powerful. In contrast to more traditional Draculas (such asChristopher Lee, who merely ‘used womenfor feeding’ while playing his vampire as a power role), one receives theimpression that Langella’s Dracula existsonly for love, having, over the centuries, found all other ambitions to betransitory and shallow. This sensitivity ofhis, in contrast to the mundane romantic infatuations of Mina’s human beau,makes Dracula worth the sacrifice thatwoman understands her historic role in love to be. It is significant that the‘normal’ humans in this film will stop atnothing to destroy the example of Dracula, shaming as it does their own pettysexual power games.”F13B. The Story of O. S.N.

O willingly endures the ordeals of Castle Roissysimply because her lover wishes her to,then emerges not as slave but as goddess for the three men - her lover, hertaskmaster at the castle, and finally SirStephen - who are devoted to her. The atmosphere of her new divinity confuses,then obsesses a female friend ofhers, who ultimately is drawn to Roissy for a similar initiation. Perhaps onlythe French, who are able to portrayeven the most outré and graphic forms of erotica without the slightest hint ofobscenity, could have made a film suchas this. It is a mirror to its audiences of what sexual and sensual maturityinvolves - and how remote from thatmaturity most persons of either sex actually are.”- 213 -Category 14: Fascism, Totalitarianism, and MagicFaschimus, Totalitarismus und Magieas of February 26, 2003This is a very potent, controversial, and dangerous area of magic, whoseimplications are rarelyexamined, understood, or appreciated by the profane [which is just as well].Much of the dataconcerning it derives from Nazi Germany, whose character as a state based uponmagical rather thanconventional principles goes a long way towards explaining the “peculiar”fascination which thatepisode continues to exert on students of history and political science. Many ofthe techniquespioneered or perfected by the Nazis continue to be used/ abused - generally in asuperficial and ignorantfashion - by every country of the world in one guise or another [never avowedlyas “Nazism”, of course].The Temple of Set emphasizes the potential of human individualism. Metapoliticalconcepts suchas Nazism do strengthen the power of humans, but only through a degree ofcollectivization of the willin a political state system. Well-run states can maximize virtue and minimizevice, as in Plato’s idealRepublic. Poorly-run states can do just the opposite, suppressing or corruptingvirtue, as in Orwell’s1984. Most contemporary political systems exist between these extremes. TheInitiate/citizen must besensitive to both the positive opportunities his society provides, and therepressive/destructiveconstraints it places on his freedom. Thus he may maximize the benefits of theformer and avoid thedamage of the latter.14A. The Mass Psychology of Fascism by Wilhelm Reich. NY: Simon & Schuster,1970. [Deutschland: DieMassenpsychologie des Faschismus, Fischer Taschenbuch-Verlag, Frankfurt, 1974](TOS-3) MA: “The controversialReich examined both the Nazi and the communist elements of Germany, found themwanting, and was roundlydenounced by them in return. This book exposes their use of mass movements andmob psychology as a sexualsubstitute, and their repression of ‘innocent’ sex as a deliberate politicaltechnique [compare #14E]. Thismanipulation of expression and repression is applied to other social phenomenaas well - such as certain organizedreligious bodies. A lucid and hard-hitting study. A biographical profile ofReich is presented in #6N, Appendix 75 -‘The Frankenstein Legacy’.”14B. The Occult and the Third Reich by Jean-Michel Angebert. NY: Macmillan,1974. (TOS-3) (TRP-3) MA:“This book contains sections on the Grail (both Christian and pagan), traditionsconcerning Atlantis and ancientinitiatory societies, the theories of Nietzsche and Wagner, Nazi mysticism, andthe Catharist tradition. Wellfootnoted. The almost fantastic subject material tends to make the author’sobjectivity suspect, but on closeexamination his argument is grounded in responsible research. On the other handOtto Rahn, the young Germanmystic whose theories are advanced in this book did not hold the alleged highrank in the SS, nor commit suicidebecause of politico/mystical reasons. He was an Unterscharführer (sergeant) whokilled himself after being expelledfrom the SS because of his sexual preferences.”14C. The Grail Legend by Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz. NY: G.P.

Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1943.[Deutschland: Verlag Franz EherNachf., München, um 1935] (TOS-5) (TRP-3) MA: “Everyone knows that this is ‘themost evil book ever written’*,but few have taken the time to actually read it, hence cannot really explainwhy. Further complicating the situationis Hitler’s interspersion of political philosophy (interesting) with emotionaltirades (not so interesting). Look for thediscussions concerning the selection of leaders, control of the masses, and thejustification for human socialorganization. You may be surprised at what you discover. Keep in mind that thisbook was written not as a historicalmemoir, but rather as a propaganda device to lend an image of philosophicalsubstance and coherence to the still-- 214 -fledgling and somewhat [due to Hitler’s incarceration in prison at the time ofMK’s writing] disorganized Nazi Party.A far more revealing ‘Hitler Memoir’ is #14K. [* During the antiSatanismhysteria of the 1980s, the entire Temple ofSet reading list was denounced by one major newspaper thus: ‘a reading listwhich includes MK’ (evidently to theunimportance of any other book on the entire list)!]”14G.

This is probably the most usefulone currently in print, which ColinWilson calls ‘the most important document on Hitler so far published’. It isnoteworthy for its focus on the manrather than on the political official [for the political official see #14H]. Ifyou are going to take a look at Hitler’s ownwritings and statements (#14F/K/L), read this first for perspective.”14H. The War Path (NY: Viking, 1978) and Hitler’s War (2 volumes) (NY: Viking,1977) by David Irving.(TOS-4) MA: “1933-39 ( WP) and 1939-45 ( HW) through Hitler’s eyes.

The Bormann Brotherhood by William Stevenson. NY: Harcourt BraceJovanovich, 1973. (TOS-3) MA:“Around VI-VII the pursuit of underground Nazi-survivalist organizations was allthe rage, and there was a flurry ofBormannism, ODESSA films/novels, etc. This little book was sort of overwhelmedin the general stampede, but itdidn’t deserve to be. A cold, clear, fact-packed study of the post-World War IIsurvival of the original Nazihierarchy.”14J. Three Faces of Fascism by Ernst Nolte. NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston,1963. [Deutschland:Faschimus: von Mussolini zu Hitler, Verlag Kurt Desch GmbH, München, 1968](TOS-4) MA: “This is a politicalscience text analyzing 20th-century fascist movements in France, Germany, andItaly. The observations concerningthe metapolitical implications of the philosophy are among the most profound yetvoiced. The analysis of the failureof the French movement is as instructive as that of the successes of the Germanand Italian movements. It isinteresting to contrast Nolte’s assessment of fascism with Hitler’s [as setforth in #14F].”14K. Hitler’s Secret Conversations 1941-1944 by H.R. Trevor-Roper (Ed.).

[Deutschland:Hitlers Tischgespräche im Führerhauptquartier, Picker, Goldmann Taschenbuch Nr.11234, München, 1979(Englische Ausgabe Herausgeber Trevor-Roper)] (TOS-5) (TRP-3) MA: “MartinBormann was sufficientlyfascinated by Adolf Hitler’s private conversational comments on various topicsthat he persuaded Hitler to allowthem to be stenographically recorded. After 1945 the transcriptions were foundamong Bormann’s private papersand were ultimately compiled and published by Professor Trevor-Roper (who alsoedited and published the finalentries of Dr. Goebbels’ diaries). Hitler’s conversations cover an astonishinglybroad spectrum of topics - organizedreligion, metaphysics, dogmatism, Voltaire, origins of the human race,æsthetics, Egyptian & Greek culture,Hoerbiger’s cosmology, genius, philosophy of law, superstition, mental diseases,etc. An impressive look into themind of an individual whom the postwar world has been conditioned to dismiss asa crude, criminal, andunintrospective thug.

[Deutschland:Gespräche mit Hitler, Europaverlag, CH-Zuerich, 1988] (TOS-5) (TRP-3) MA:“Rauschning was a regional partyleader (Gauleiter) of the early Nazi Party who was a confidant of Hitler’sduring 1932-34. At first so impressed withthe Führer’s private statements that he took extensive and immediate notes, helater took fright and bolted to Paris.In 1937-38 he wrote a theoretical condemnation of Nazism entitled The Revolutionof Nihilism: Warning to theWest (NY: Alliance Book Corporation, 1939). It seemed so alarmist that few tookit seriously - until World War IIbroke out. Then Rauschning was able to publish these transcripts and analyses ofHitler’s conversations. Topicsinclude: Aristocracy, Antichrist, barbarism, ethics of war, a new social order,the Human Solstice, Black & WhiteMagic, and the mystical elements in Obersalzburg. Most of the material for Nazioccultism alluded to in #4B camefrom this book. It was regarded as so ‘weird’ as to be spurious until after thewar, when the #14K material came tolight and substantiated it.”14M. Hitler’s Secret Sciences by Nigel Pennick. Suffolk: Neville Spearman, 1981.(TOS-4) (TRP-1) MA: “Theesoteric section of the German Nazi SS was not the Sicherheitsdienst [as allegedin #6L] but the DeutscheAhnenerbe (German Ancestral Heritage Organization). Most histories of the SSconcern themselves with the better-known organizations and activities of the Black Order, mentioning the Ahnenerbeonly in passing. This is one of thefirst books to discuss it in any detail. Again there is a lot of #14B/C/Dmaterial, but it is all relevant and coherentlyorganized. This is a concise (177 pages), fact-packed book bolstered by a strongbibliography of rare and unusualpublications and periodicals.

The Passing of the Great Race by Madison Grant. NY: Charles Scribner’sSons, 1916. [Deutschland: WU:8*-913] (TOS-5) MA: “You can still find #14F in print, because it’s a goodwhipping-boy for sanctimonous finger-waggling. It is less easy to find the books from ‘our side’ that argued alongsimilar lines. This is [was!] one of themore famous, and you may still uncover an occasional copy in the back room of aused-book store or in the darkestcorners of obscure libraries. Grant was not exactly a nonentity orlunatic-fringe fanatic. He was Chairman of theNew York Zoological Society, Trustee of the American Museum of Natural History,and a Councilor of the AmericanGeographical Society. In this book [by a prominent publisher] he argues aforceful case for a European race historythat would have done credit to Hitler and Rosenberg. The most interesting aspectof this book is that only a very fewyears ago it was accepted as a respectable contender in the academic/scientificcommunity. After World War II itwas, in Orwell’s terms, guilty of Crimethink and thus condemned to be anUnperson. There is a lesson to be learnedhere concerning the durability and invulnerability of ‘established scientificfact’ when it becomes politically orsocially inconvenient. I hereby suggest that you make up your own mind as towhether the book is convincing. Afterall, I wouldn’t want to get in trouble for even appearing to endorse it ...”14O.

Putnam’s Sons, 1942.(TOS-4) MA: “The study of international relations on the basis of power politicsis academically known as politicalrealism ( Realpolitik), and before reading #14P you might want to flip throughthe bible of this school, HansMorgenthau’s Politics Among Nations, for a general familiarity with itsprinciples. In 1926 and 1928 OswaldSpengler published his powerful indictment of contemporary Western civilization,The Decline of the West, and thismade a great impression on a German General named Karl Haushofer. Haushoferbecame a professor who gainedincreasing fame in Germany as the master-theoretician of ‘Geopolitics’, being apart-political, part-geographic, andpart-mystical rationale for aggressive state expansionism. Haushofer wasconsidered by many to be the evil geniusbehind Hitler’s ‘blood and soil’ and ‘living-space’ programs. He wrote nosingle, coherent text of his philosophy. Thisbook was commissioned in order to explain Geopolitics to a still-uncomprehendingU.S. diplomatic community, andit does a good job. Geopolitical thinking was out of favor in the West untilreintroduced by Henry Kissinger (aMorgenthau enthusiast), but it has always been the lynchpin of Eastern(Soviet/Chinese) foreign policy. Strausz-Hupe summarizes: ‘World policy evolves towards several continental systems, andtechnology accentuates thestrategic importance of large, contiguous areas. Thus the era of overseasempires and free world trade closes. If thisreasoning is pushed to its absolute conclusion, the national state is also athing of the past, and the future belongs tothe giant state. Many nations will be locked in a few vast compartments. But ineach of these one people, controllinga strategic area, will be master of the others.’”14Q. Wewelsburg 1933 bis 1945: SS Kult- und Terrorstätte by Prof. Dr. KarlHüser.

The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology by RobertCecil. London: B.T.Batsford Ltd, 1972. (TOS-4) (TRP-3) MA: “The best biography and criticalanalysis concerning Alfred Rosenberg,‘official philosopher’ of the Nazi movement. Much of the material otherwise inexistence concerning Rosenberg issuppressed by the Soviet Union, while previous Western biographies and editionsof his memoirs were crudelyedited to portray him as more of a monster than a human being, much less aphilosopher.

For Freedom Destined: Mysteries of Man’s Evolution in the Mythology ofWagner’s Ring Operas andParsifal by Franz E. Winkler. Garden City, NY: Waldorf Press, 1974. (TOS-4)(TRP-1) MA: “The definitive study ofthe magical and philosophical aspects of the Ring and Parsifal operas. From thebook: ‘When we think of the originof man, we insist illogically on confusing the history of his purely biologicalbeing with the history of his spirit; thelatter defies any attempt at investigation by methods we now call scientific.Darwin and his followers deal with theemergent evolution of visible man, while on the other hand religion andmythology deal with the evolution of hisinvisible soul. In his cycle of the Ring and Parsifal, Wagner uses the magicpower of music, words, and scenery toopen man’s heart to the history of the hidden essence of his own self, and tothe changing forces that are activebehind the sensory phenomena of man and Earth.’”14V.

It is particularly instructive to compare Hoffer’s theseswith the experiences of Hitler, Himmler,and Rosenberg as treated elsewhere in this reading-list category. The book’sstrong point is Hoffer’s famedcommon-sense, but this same feature is also its weak point, because it isobvious that Hoffer is not aware of [or doesnot understand] the principles discussed, for example, in #14T.”14W.

Wilhelm Bernhart.Metairie, Louisiana: Thunderbird Press, Inc., 1988 (ISBN: 0-1913159-05-0).(TOS-3) (TRP-3) MA: “Buechner was asurgeon in the U.S. Army during World War II; Bernhart was a German U-boatofficer and recipient of the Knight’sCross in the same war. This intriguing collaboration by them expands upon thethemes of #14D. An initial sectiontraces the [legendary] history of the Spear of Longinus through its arrival inthe Hofburg Museum of Vienna.Subsequent sections deal with the disposition of the Spear during the ThirdReich & thereafter, the Wewelsburg,Nazi/SS occultism in general, the death of Adolf Hitler, and the dispostion ofhis body and/or the Lance and/orNazi/SS treasure at the end of the war. As is the case with #14D, how much ofthis book is fact and how much iseither speculation or outright fiction is open to debate. Nevertheless, alsolike #14D, it tells a colorful tale and is anentertaining read. It even ends on a suitably ominous note, proclaiming that theKnights of the Holy Lance existeven today (underground), and will, Barbarossa-like, remanifest themselves atthe proper magical moment.

The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German NationalSocialism by Stefan Kuehl.NY/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994, ISBN: 0-19-508260-5. (TOS-4) MA: “Oneof the most criticizedelements of Nazi Germany was its attempt to ‘purify the Aryan race’ through allmanner of breeding-control andnon-‘Aryan’ suppression policies. All of this was based upon a concept of ‘race’that went only skin/appearance deep,ignoring actual genetic factors. As a result the Nazi program, and earlier/laterones like it by other states, descended- 217 -into mere arbitrary prejudice and cruelty. An unfortunate by-product of this isthe stigma that hangs over all humangenetic engineering research - which critics attack as ‘genocide’ rather than asa scientific means for the gradualimprovement of human physiology and health. In this remarkable book Kuehl, whois a sociologist and historian atthe University of Bielefeld in Germany, shows how the Nazi eugenics programswere inspired by original programsin the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the century, and analyzes the‘new scientific racism’ which societiesare grappling with today.”14AA. Trading with the Enemy: The Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1945 by CharlesHigham. NY: Barnes &Noble, 1983 (ISBN: 0-76070-009-5). (TOS-3) MA: “While World War II was beingorchestrated by the politiciansand fought & endured by the masses, many large companies and financialinstitutions on both sides continued todo business with all sides, maximizing their profits through the demands andstresses of the war. Indeed theremarkable thing is how little notice they took of the war, save as a changingeconomic ‘playground’. Higham, aformer _New York Times_ writer, calmly documents this astonishing ‘peek behindthe curtain’, offering the readersobering insights into what any international war really means, and to whom. Theimportance of this book lies notjust in its historical cynicism, but in the lessons it implies for present andfuture ‘national conflicts’.”14AB. Al Khemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political, and Private Aspects of R.A.Schwaller de Lubicz by AndréVandenBroeck Hudson. NY: Lindisfarne Press, 1987. (TOS-5) DW: “This book isessential for fully understanding allof the work of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. Schwaller began his magical/politicalcareer as a fascist, trying to work outthe dilemma of a people becoming self-empowered, godlike beings yet cooperatingin a nationalistic group. He was amember of the Tala, the esoteric core of Les Veilleurs, a group which alsoincluded Rudolph Hess and possibly hadties to the Thule Society. When pressure was brought to bear on his group, heemigrated to Egypt and became anadvocate of ancient Egyptian wisdom. A couple of notable quotes from the book:‘Black Magic is a Pandora’s box,not because the practitioner is evil, but because he lacks the “sense of thetemple” as safeguard of ideas.’ ‘“Il fautvoir cela dans sa nue crudité” was all the moral advice he would ever offer. Itimplies a free vista of the existing stateof affairs, unhindered and unembellished by an artificial code of morals.’VandenBroeck was Schwaller’s student thelast two years of the latter’s life. The book explains the experiment of socialalchemy to create empoweredindividuals: His magical work was an attempt to recreate the pharaonic secret.This is the hidden ground behindFulcanelli, Lucie Lamy, Bika Reed, John Anthony West, Robert Lawlor, Ronald K.Barrett, and many othertransformational elitists in the New Age movement, including the Temple of Set.A great study of the Word Al-Khemi, meaning both the secret of the pharaohs and the method of its attainment.The powers and dangers ofsymbolism are revealed by this book.”14AC.

As a modern-dress version of the Conflict of Horus and Set[but which is which?], this filmoscillates between the harshly real and the surreal.

The Empty Mirror. Universal, Lion’s Gate Films, 2000. MA: “Portrayals ofAdolf Hitler in postwarfilms have been inflexibly propagandistic: He is never to be shown as anythingother than an ugly, screaming,drooling, and of course insane Orc. TEM is perhaps the first film to at leastpartially defy this requirement, showinghim, at least for part of this film, as a rational, introspective visionary. Thefilm’s title refers to a speculation: Whatwould Hitler, looking back on his career, ‘see in the mirror’? Hitler is playedby the British actor Norman Rodway,who not only looks reasonably like AH but represents him responsibly. I am notsurprised that this film was anofficial selection at the Cannes Film Festival, but I am surprised that it wasnot suppressed altogether.

The reality is astonishing insome ways andoverblown in others. Industrialized civilizations of the planet are now sodependent upon computerizedsystems of commerce and communication that they are close to being “at themercy” of the computerscientist, whose responsibility it is to “make the things work” - and,incidentally, to set parameters forhuman enterprise by taking computer design in one direction or another.Books for this reading list, many of them computer-prepared themselves, werelocated, ordered,and shipped by computers ... after which the reading list was typed on acomputer [originally 1976 on aPolyMorphic #8813 and now on a Macintosh], printed on a computer-controlledlaser-printer,duplicated on a computer-controlled copy machine, and delivered to you with theassistance ofcomputer-maintained address-list/labels read in turn by computer Zip-codescanners at the postoffice ... with updates available on the Temple’s electronic database, Glinda.Obviously a computer-dominated society is hyperefficient in some ways,hypervulnerable inothers.

From the book: ‘I like to think of artificial intelligence as thescientific apotheosis of a venerable culturaltradition, the proper successor to golden girls and brazen heads, disreputablebut visionary geniuses and crackpots,and fantastical laboratories during stormy November nights. Its heritage issingularly rich and varied, with legaciesfrom myth and literature; philosophy and art; mathematics, science, andengineering; warfare, commerce, and evenquackery.

Certainly it begs the question to use those very terms todistinguish one extreme from theother! The Church of Satan sought freedom by attempting to reverse the good/evilnorms of society;the Temple of Set seeks freedom by attempting to escape those norms - andpreexisting ones - and toencourage its Initiates to construct enlightened, individualistic definitions.This is as much an art as ascience, and the quest must be undertaken and pursued with logic, caution,common sense ... andapprehension of the Agathon.16A. Political Ideas and Ideologies: A History of Political Thought by MulfordQ. Sibley. NY: Harper & Row,1970. [Deutschland: WU: 22a/11] (TOS-1) (LVT-1) MA: “Until you’ve read anddigested this material, you reallyoughtn’t to talk about ‘political philosophy’ any more than someone who hasn’tread an anatomical textbook shouldtry to hold forth on anatomy. I teach university courses surveying the historyof political theory, and this is far andaway the most lucid, objective, and comprehensive survey text I’ve yet found. Ithas two conspicuous omissions -Nietzsche and ancient Egypt - and it is oriented towards the political ratherthan the more abstract or conceptualbranches of philosophy. So you won’t find Kant, Schopenhauer, Sartre, etc. here.The author [wonderful name!] wasa very distinguished and a very controversial Professor of Political Science atthe University of Minnesota. If youwonder why something like this is TOS-1, trust me. After you’ve absorbed theknowledge it contains, you’ll wonderon what basis you held political opinions before reading it.” J. Lewis VI°: “Goread a textbook? In this case, yes.Sibley’s book lacks dryness of text and contains doors opening onto the essenceof politics. It is valuable for far morethan explanations of sandbox politics.”16B. Nietzsche by Karl Jaspers. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1965.[Deutschland: Nietzsche und dasChristentum, Piper-Verlag, München, 1985 (WU: 37c/1845)] (TOS-4) MA: “Trying toget a grip on Nietzschethrough either his own writings or those of others is a bit like trying to getan octopus into a straitjacket. He thoughtat a level which the German language did not anticipate, and so there is bittercontroversy concerning the propertranslation of many of his terms and texts into English [to say nothing of theirproper meaning in German]. Aftergoing through a number of editions, translations, texts, analyses, andcriticisms, I have come to rest on #16B as themost useful for the Setian who wants to ‘get at’ Nietzsche as quickly andaccurately as possible. Jaspers, Professor ofPhilosophy at the University of Basel, Switzerland, is one of the acknowledgedgiants of the academic community. Inthis book he sought to make the reader ‘think Nietzsche’s thoughts with him’,and in my opinion he succeeded.There are sections on both Nietzsche’s life and his philosophy, which must beconsidered together for the latter to bemeaningful. 500 pages.” DW: “This book is in three parts. Read all of it, butthe second is the part to reread. Greatmaterial providing interesting springboards for Setian discussion.”16C. The Annotated Jules Verne: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by WalterJames Miller. NY:Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976. (TOS-4) (LVT-4) MA: “English-language editions of thisstory prior to this edition havebeen appallingly distorted and shortened by incompetent editors and translators.Verne was a genius far beyond hisreputation as a mere yarn-spinner, and his moral philosophy is sublimelysubjective. The annotations in this editionwill help to illustrate Verne’s expertise in a variety of arts and sciences.Walt Disney must be given credit forbringing many direct quotes into his celebrated film: [Nemo: ‘I am not what youcall a civilized man! I have donewith society entirely, for reasons which I alone have the right of appreciating.I do not therefore obey its laws, and Idesire you never to allude to them before me again.’]” J. Lewis VI°: “CaptainNemo is not, he says, a civilized man.His deliberate separation from the consistency imposed by society has produced anew man, a superman intent oncreating a new world.”16D. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. Cambridge: Houghton Mifflin, 1967(2nd Edition).[Deutschland: Der Herr der Ringe, Klett-Kotta Verlag, Stuttgart, 1984] (TOS-4)(LVT-4) MA: “LOTR is not on thislist just because it is a stirring adventure tale, but rather because itillustrates a very significant point about good/evil: that ‘evil’ can be destroyed only by a greater ‘evil’ or by accident.Saruman attempts the former andGandalf the latter, and Gandalf succeeds ... to the satisfaction of egalitarianreaders [but who would want to hangaround Middle-earth after all the excitement was gone?]. LOTR is thus anargument for Christian morality, which isimmediately evident from The Silmarillion, whose philosophical sections - the‘Ainulindale’ and ‘Valaquenta’ - aretransparently adapted from Paradise Lost.” J. Lewis VI°: “Issues of ethics andmorality are central throughout thethree LOTR volumes. The Initiate embarking on the path to eternity needs morethan the simple wish to survive; hemust comprehend and define both ‘good’ and ‘evil’. See also the Morlindalë(#16Q).- 222 -16E. The Marquis de Sade by Donald Thomas. Boston: New York Graphic Society,1976. [Deutschland: DerMarquis de Sade, Blanvalet Verlag, München, 1978 (WU: 28/18-527)] (TOS-3) MA:“The best biographicaltreatment of this controversial and notorious libertine. As Thomas assesses him,he was opposed to the notion ofprogressive philosophy, holding the supreme power of the human race to be itsself-destructive power; theextinction of the species is not to be regretted; history is not progress buthelpless drifting. Compare this point ofview with that of Satanism, which is similarly cynical but holds out certainhopes for the individual’s transcending ofthe mass neurosis. [A more recent biography is Sade by Maurice Lever (NY:Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1993, ISBN0-374-20298) More text, less of a ‘coffeetable’ book. Lever is Director of theNational Center for Scientific Researchin Paris.]”16F. Parapolitics by Raghavan Iyer. NY: Oxford University Press, 1979. (TOS-4)MA: “An admirable,beautifully orchestrated attempt to apply the political philosophy of Plato tothe modern world. Iyer lays thegroundwork with diagrams explaining the hierarchy of mental activity: Noesis(‘pure vision’ - apprehension of theGood [the Agathon]), Dianoia (logical ‘thinking’), Pistis (‘believing’ -dogmatic acceptance of ideology), and Eikasia(‘imagining’ - the lowest form of image-simplification and instinctivebehavior). These forms of activity may beapplied to society in a variety of political ‘dimensions’, governed by varioussyntheses of logos (speech), will(strength), and eros (sympathy). The resultant political forces may be generatedtowards the attainment of variousgoals: self-preservation, power, stability, reason, welfare, perfectability, andultimately the parapolitics oftranscendence. This book is a pearl of thought; its sole defect is that it wascast before a world of largely egalitarianreaders [it was allowed to go out of print in 1985]. Do not attempt it until youhave first mastered #12C, #16A, and#16G. Iyer was Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University ofCalifornia, Santa Barbara.

The questions are left open- ended, the expectation being thatthe reader must think his ownanswers to them.

Acrazy, wonderful, informative, educational, and non-fictional tour of the majormanias of Western civilization up tothe time of the book’s publication.

You were theone they used against us, Bruce:the one who played it rough.

NY: AtlanticMonthly Press, 1995 (ISBN 0-87113-532-9). (TOS-4) MA: “Thishistorical/sociological book is an argument forBloom’s thesis: that ‘evil is a by-product of nature’s strategies for creation,and is woven into our most basicbiological fabric’ (the ‘Lucifer Principle’). He further postulates that the LPapplies even more to at the group level(what he calls the ‘superorganism’), and that this is what actually matters inthe course of history. In talking of ‘evil’Bloom means no theological concept, but rather the social impulsive, emotional,destructive, and aggressive featuresof [principally but not just] human social groups. He case-studies severalhistorical episodes to show that ‘progressresults from this pain’ rather than from more tranquil times. Somewhat Hegelian,somewhat oversimplistic - but notwithout its point. Bloom’s credentials are somewhat elusive: ‘member of the NYAcademy of Science, the AmericanPsychological Society, and the American Political Science Society’.”16Q. Morlindalë by the One Ring. San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2003. (TS-3)Introduction by BaronRachane. MA:”The Morlindalë is a parody embracing J.R.R. Tolkien’s Silmarillionand Lord of the Rings. Parodiesare usually assumed to be humorous, but the Morlindalë is anything but that: adark, tormented tragedyreminiscent of the ancient Greek classics. In Tolkien’s original masterworks wesee remarkably little of Melkor andSauron, despite their ominous shadow over events. Here in these nine scrolls wefinally meet them face-to-face, feeltheir emotions, hear their voices. Do they become heroes and those of theoriginal stories villains? By no means.Tolkien’s history is unchanged, and his champions retain their character andvirtue. But perhaps judgments aboutgood and evil, life and death, love and hate are herein less simple and summary.The Morlindalë is not a parody ofsympathy, but rather one of empathy: a recognition of and respect for themystery and dignity of all life despite itsmany different manifestations.http://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Aquino/e/B01GEWRIMU* * *F16A. Batman. 1989. Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger. Directed byTim Burton. MA: “Thisbegan as an attempt to bring #16N to the screen, and succeeded at least incapturing the noir atmosphere of itsMetropolis-like architecture and urban decay. Michael Keaton’s Batman isconvincing, but not nearly as savagelypsychotic as in #16N. This film came close to being a horrific masterpiece, butat some point it was decided to castJack Nicholson as the Joker and play that role for comic relief, presumably tomake the film acceptable to youthfulaudiences. The historic Joker was a malevolent fiend in whose risus sardonicusdeath-grin there was nothing theleast amusing.”F16B. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Walt Disney, 1954. Disney Video #15VS. JamesMason, Kirk Douglas,Paul Lukas, Peter Lorre. MA: “A thoroughly excellent translation of #16C to amotion picture, less the extensivescientific/oceanographic instruction which Verne packed into his novel. [On theother hand, there are manylingering camera shots of underwater attractions, so Disney’s interest innaturalism is upheld.] Disney also changedVerne’s rather unimaginative, spindle-shaped Nautilus into a magnificent metal‘monster’ whose moonlight chargesat hapless warships are one of the screen’s most dramatic sequences. Atomicenergy was still a thing of awe whenthis film was made, as can be seen from the drama accorded the Nautilus’ atomicreactor, the design of Nemo’sVulcania laboratories, and the final atomic explosion.”F16C. Apocalypse Now [Redux]. 1979. Francis Ford Coppola. Marlon Brando, MartinSheen, Robert Duvall.MA: “Loosely adapted from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, this film is a sortof Caligula of the Vietnam War:Much of what it shows is in fact historically accurate, but in a single collageit appears so stark, obscene, and insanethat the viewer tends to dismiss it as merely a baroque satire. Brando portraysan American Special Forces colonelwhose obsession with the war leads to his alienation from the ethical ritualsexpected by the U.S command- 224 -structure; Sheen is the captain sent to assassinate him. We are left to wonderwhy the destruction of human lifesanctioned by governments is ‘good’, while that lacking such sanction, even ifapparently justified by circumstances,is ‘bad’.”- 225 -Category 17: The Gift of SetDas Geschenk von Setas of February 26, 2003Sometime between the Lower-Paleolithic Period (about 800,000 years ago) and theMiddle-Paleolithic (about 100,000 years ago), the proto-human brain underwent amutation directly contraryto the objective-universal laws of natural evolution. Between PithecanthropusErectus and Cro-Magnonthe cranial cavity almost doubled in size - from about 900 cc to about 1,700 cc.Darwinian evolutionistsare completely unable to explain this development and therefore deal with it intexts by simply glossingover it.

Lifetide by Lyall Watson. NY: Simon & Schuster, 1979. (TOS-3) MA: “Dr.Watson, an anthropologist whois only very slightly ‘tainted’ by his interest in phenomena that politeacademia carefully avoids, is the author of#22D and #22Q as well. Here he discusses scientific evidence for theextra-terrestrial origins of life on Earth andattempts to describe the development of the phenomenon of self-consciousnessthrough purely-natural means. It isa valiant attempt. He stumbles, however, on certain features (such as theworking vertebrate eye) that cannot beexplained by evolution, and finally he is forced to admit that there issomething beyond the natural order at work. Inan effort to avoid taking the plunge into theology, he coins the term‘lifetide’, a sort of neo-version of the ‘vitalism’used as an escape-valve for inconvenient facts by hard-core Darwinists. Anexcellent book for seeing just how farscience can go in beating its head against the door of non-natural tamperingwith the human intellectual equation.”17D. The Ordeal of Change by Eric Hoffer.

(TOS-3) MA: “The recent attack onaccepted Darwinian theories ofevolution and natural selection by religious fundamentalists has prompted a fewbrave natural scientists and"},{"pageContent":"biologists to question some of the ‘sacred cows’ in the field of evolution.Evolution as a principle stands up to themost exacting tests, but some of the Darwinian sub-assumptions are found not to.There are ‘gaps’ in the fossilrecord between major species - for example, between early invertebrate seacreatures and ancient fishes. Andbetween fish and amphibians. And between the reptile & the mammal jaw. How couldthe hyper-intricate humaneye have evolved through ‘intermediate stages’? Hitching then launches into acareful discussion of mutation, genes,and cellular coding, after which he analyzes the best arguments the creationistshave to offer. While dismissingcreationism as ridiculous, he agrees with British Museum palaeontologist ColinPatterson: ‘They [the creationists]didn’t have the right answers, but they certainly asked a lot of the rightquestions.’ In addition to a 4-pagebibliography of technical works, Hitching provides an additional 4-pageannotated bibliography of introductoryreading, keyed to points brought out in the chapters of his book.

It remains scientifically elusive. Aninteresting feature of this book is Penrose’sdiscussion of what he calls the ‘Platonic Universe, in which mathematicalconcepts and truths inhabit an actualworld of their own, that is timeless and without physical location’. Penrosesketches his discussion in terms of the*interrelationship* of this ‘Platonic U’ with the ‘Physical U’ of scientificobservation (the Temple of Set’s ‘objectiveuniverse’) and the ‘bridge’ of the ‘Mental U’ of observing/reflectingintelligences.”17I.

(LVT-1) MA: “As noted in#17A, the conceptual roots for 2001 go back 1-1/2 decades to Childhood’s End,though this was [for obvious religiousreasons] not advertised with the film’s release. Even so it is surprising thatthe film did not draw fire fromconventional religion, its theme being that mankind is essentially an experimenton this planet by an alienintelligence. The simple device of changing the ‘Devil’ Karellen [or Set] to aGolden Sectioned monolith made theplot sufficiently abstract to be non-threatening. Besides, most audiences wereless interested in the Nietzschean/Setian implications of the film than they were with HAL the computer [supposedlymore advanced than IBM, so hisname was created by ‘the next higher letter’], space scenes with Strausswaltzes, and the final ‘stargate trip’ scene.Seen through Setian lenses, 2001 remains a beautiful essay on the Gift of Set.”J.

(TOS-3) MA: “In this brilliant book Harrington argues that thepresence and the fear of death are rootcauses for much if not all of human behavioral characteristics. Non-humananimals cannot conceptualize andanticipate death, hence are not governed by it. Harrington then catalogues thesurprising number of ways in whichdeath-awareness grips human philosophy, presents data on efforts to arrestdeath, and finally ventures hypothesesconcerning a non-death- obsessed environment.

[No doubt the prospect will seem as incredible to humans as aforecast of theirComing Into Being would have seemed to Pithecanthropus.] Many phenomena casuallycalled “ESP” arein fact the first symptoms of what may be termed the Metamind.

(TOS-3) MA: “Anupdate to PsychicDiscoveries Behind the Iron Curtain with a military flavor, written not byscientists but by one of Jack Anderson’ssensationalistic journalists. Nevertheless this is a rather impressivelyresearched and written book, packed with datafound nowhere else outside of classified government research reports. McRaeanalyzes the ‘remote viewing’experiments conducted amongst much fanfare & big bucks by the Stanford ResearchInstitute [see #2O] andconcludes [as I do] that their results are unconvincing. Excellent chapterentitled ‘The Need to Believe’ on wishfulthinking concerning Psi phenomena. The debunking of phony psychics like UriGeller is treated. The chapter on the‘First Earth Battalion’ is zany; its deletion would have improved the book.There is an excellent 12-pagebibliography, listing both classified and unclassified sources.”19X.

It is a tour to leave even the most cynical & suspicious Satanistthoroughly stunned at the calculating‘machinery’ operating behind the apparently-innocent peace/love movement of the’60s/’70s. This story does notdevalue the genuine idealisms of some of the more visionary and idealisticpeople described in #4K, but it doesshow that every silver cloud has its dark lining - to rearrange the aphorism abit! In this case the lining was/is a verydark one indeed.”19Y. Psychic Warfare: Fact or Fiction? by John White (Ed.).

(TOS-4) MA: “Why is ‘horror’ as a feature of fiction soenduring and appealing? What exactlyis it? These are the questions which Carroll, an Associate Professor ofPhilosophy [and Theater] at CornellUniversity set out to answer in this complex and precise text. Drawing fromancient Classical tragedies as well asfrom the latest ‘slasher/gore’ films and novels of the present era, Carrollestablishes that this fascination is as mucha normal psychological need as an affectation or deviation from the norm.

The Will: Its Nature, Power, and Development by William W. Atkinson.London: L.N. Fowler & Co.,1915. (TOS-3) Leon Wild II°: “Will is a faculty often taken for granted bymagicians. Will is more than desire andintent. This book is an introduction fo the development and use of will. Thebook has an essentially pragmatic ‘new’psychological basis. The nature of will is discussed, to include desire,decisiveness, and action. The active will (orvolition) is the aim of the book’s exercises, which are useful for concentrationand visualization development.Atkinson’s will description almost goes as far as GBM, and is certainly usefulin LBM concepts, in that theimagination creates patterns or mental molds which the will subsequently causesto manifest. Recognizing andcountering negative marks of the will are also discussed.”19AB. Luck by Nicholas Rescher. NY: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1995.

The Psychic Battlefield: A History of the Military-Occult Complex by W.Adam Mandelbaum. NewYork: St. Martin’s Press, 2000 (ISBN 0-312-20955-X). (TOS-3) MA: “A methodicaland thoughtful survey ofpsychological and quasi-parapsychological warfare techniques and experimentsduring the past 5,000 years. Theonly weak point of the book is a little too much ‘wishful thinking’ on thesubject of ‘remote viewing’, though it can beargued that Mandelbaum is essentially just reporting on what was a long,expensive, and profoundly stupid snipe-hunt by the U.S. government.

Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis,Walter Pidgeon, Robby.(LVT-2) MA: “In the middle of the 50s, MGM reared back and produced this firstbig-budget ‘intellectual’ spaceopera, drawing from Freudian theories of the ego & id, salted with a bit ofShakespeare’s Tempest, and pepperedwith the most charming robot since Gort. The design of the spaceship and eventhe casual uniforms of the crew wereall forerunners of the original Star Trek television series. The plot centeredaround an ancient, highly-civilized race(the Krel), who had succeeded in expanding their mental powers almost toinfinity. They were destroyed, however,by the id-monsters of their subconscious minds - a process which Walter Pidgeon,as a human scientist, comes all toclose to repeating.” J. Lewis VI°: “Forbidden Planet has deliberate parallelswith Shakespeare’s The Tempest. Theisland is transformed into a planet, the magician Prospero is a scientist livingalone on the planet with his daughter,and Ariel has taken on a metallic shell as Robby the Robot. The story isentertaining in its own right; those familiarwith The Tempest will find it even more so. For the Setian the greatest lessonsin it are those of the power of themind. Evolution does not cast away those parts of ourselves we now have undercontrol. It takes the darker partsalong on the journey and accentuates their power should they be loosened. TheInitiate heading for eternity shouldgive Forbidden Planet an evening of his time.”F19B. Altered States. 1980. (19-1170) William Hurt, Blair Brown, Charles Haid.Director: Ken Russell. MA:“Adapted from the novel by Paddy Chayefsky, which in turn was loosely modeled onreal-life experiments andexperiences recorded by John Lilly in #19N. A wild and weird trip through the‘final frontiers’ of the mind, byhumans not quite ready to venture there yet. Hurt/Lilly resolves, he proclaimsin a crowded bar, to identify anddefine the human soul ... ‘and I’m going to find the fucker!’ He eventuallydoes.”F19C. Doctor Who. (LVT-3) J. Lewis VI°: “The question of man’s abnormal mentalevolution is one that haspuzzled him since the time he began to realize his difference. The question isaddressed by the Temple of Set in‘Genesis III’, in the papers of the Priesthood of Set and the Book of Leviathan.It has also appeared in science-fiction. Doctor Who has shown three such ventures into the question:”F19C1. The Dæmons. “Jon Pertwee’s Doctor entered into The Dæmons to give viewersan action-filled showwith a little something for everyone. An ancient barrow, the Devil’s Hump, foundnear the quaint village of Devil’sEnd, is being opened by an archæologist. [The gossip center of the village isthe pub known as the ‘Cloven Hoof’,appropriately enough.] This Doctor Who story had witchcraft, hypnosis, a Sataniccult headed by Mr. Magister [theMaster masquerading as the new rector], the gadgetry of which Pertwee is so fondto this day, and a giganticcreature with cloven hooves, horns, fangs, and the whole nine yards. This dæmon,Azal, stayed behind in 100,000BCE as a representative of his race, awaiting the day man would becomesufficiently advanced to awaken him andallow the dæmon to judge whether mankind had responded to the subtle nudgesgiven him by the dæmons andtherefore was fit to rule his planet with the dæmons’ scientific knowledge; orwhether the race should be wiped outas a failure. The strategy of the two Time Lords is fascinating to watch. Afterall, for what purpose did Set instill theBlack Flame in man? I doubt he would close his experiment by dropping the entirehuman race in the rubbish bin asAzal decides to do. No need to; mankind is quite capable of wiping itself andits planet out of existence without theaid of aliens. The Dæmons was released in black and white and is still visuallystunning. The rumor among DoctorWho enthusiasts is that there is a color version of the show out theresomewhere, last known to be at someundisclosed location in Canada.”F19C2. Image of the Fendahl. “‘Like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fearand dread, and having turnedonce, turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth closebehind him tread.’ That charming littlepiece of poetry by Coleridge formed the beginning of the Fendahl script, ascience-fiction/horror story commencingwith the murder of a hiker by an unknown monster in a dark wood and proceedingto a study being done on anancient human skull unearthed in Kenya in 1984 CE, an inverse pentagram makingup a congenital anomaly in its- 235 -makeup. The secrets of the skull unfold as the Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leeladiscover it to be a link with theFendahl, an æons-old force which lives through absorbing life and is thereforethe personification of death. Thesuggestion in the story is that the Fendahl bred a certain genius in man toenable him to eventually grow sosophisticated as to open the gates for the force. This is another of the showscomplete with it all: witchcraft, one ofthe explanations of ESP, an evil cult at work in the midst of it all, and theDoctor working to save mankind as thosehe seeks to help go out of their way in their attempts to kill him. Image of theFendahl is a story which deviates fromthe reasons we suspect man to have the Gift of the Black Flame, but it doesexplore via fiction the darkeralternatives.”F19C3. The City of Death. “The explosion of a Jagaroth spaceship on theprehistoric planet Earth of400,000,000 BCE splinters its pilot, Scaroth, into identical selves who arescattered throughout time. Each self is incontact with the others, and each strives to push the advancement of mankind upto a point at which, like the othertwo parallel shows, the alien can benefit from the upward leaps. In the case ofScaroth, the goal is to finally bringabout men of intelligence sufficient to create a time machine which will allowhim to return to the original disasterand halt it. The Doctor (Tom Baker) stops the Jagaroth pilot, but only just inthe nick of time; had he succeeded inreversing his original mistake, man would never have evolved from the primevalsoup affected by the radiationreleased on the ship’s explosion. In The City of Death, Image of the Fendahl,and The Dæmons, there was acommon theme: An outside intelligence altered the genetic makeup of that whichwould become man, and for adefinite reason. Only Azal is clinical about the task and so comes closest toSet’s own plans. The obligatory threat tomankind would have left viewers with an uneasy feeling of incompleteness in itsabsence.”F19D.

Dutton, 1969), thisdeals with G.’s trek through Asia and Africa in search of Truth. It reveals manythings and is worth repeatedviewings. Of special note is the concept of resonance in the scene of thesinging contest, and the old Persianmetaphor of ‘going to Egypt’, which means working through mastery of this worldas one’s first test.

Rucker is a Professor of Mathematics, so can deal with the veryheavyweight mathematical conceptsand formulæ involved in this subject. Fortunately for the non-mathemagician, healso has the gift of explaining[most] things in non-math-jargon. Even so, you’re in for some very heavythinking if you tackle this book. It startsout fairly conversationally, but before you know it you’re floundering aroundin: temporal & spatial infinities,Pythagoreanism, Cantorism, transfinite numbers (from Omega to Epsilon-Zero &Alephs), infinitesimals & surrealnumbers, Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem, robot consciousness, set theory,transfinite cardinals, etc. Just toirritate you, each chapter concludes with a selection of problems and paradoxesillustrating the aspects of infinitycovered therein.

Davies discusses subatomic & superspace, mind/ matter, thenature of reality, waves &particles, holes & tunnels in space, Möbius strip phenomena, etc. Davies isProfessor of Natural Philosophy at theUniversity of Adelaide, South Australia. The book makes two assumptions that Ipersonally find questionable: the‘Big Bang’ and Einstein’s theories of relativity. Nevertheless there is a lot ofanalysis here that does not hinge on- 237 -these two sacred cows, and in any case it is virtually impossible to find anotherwise-first-rate physics text thatdoesn’t bow and scrape before them.

The poor old Navy has spent fortyyears denying that anything like theso-called ‘Philadelphia Experiment’ ever happened, but unfortunately there is agrowing accumulation of evidencethat something took place - perhaps not visual invisibility or dimensionaltransportation, but something morealong the line of an effort to mask the radar/electronic ‘footprint’ of thevessel through the generation of powerfulmagnetic fields. If, as #17F and #19I/J maintain, the human body and mind areseriously affected byelectromagnetic fields, intense damage could have been done to those on boardthe Eldridge and indeed to anyonein its vicinity. One would prefer to think that the Navy wouldn’t cover up sucha mishap, but the monkey-businesspresently going on with Project Sanguine [see Runes #III-3, review of #17F]makes one wonder. #20H is definitelynot a ‘nut book’, but rather a careful, logical recounting of the author’s longand often frustrating efforts to uncoverthe truth [or lack thereof] behind what has become one of the more famouslegends of Outer Limits-type research.#20H is reviewed in Runes #IV-2.

In late 1982 Asimov published asequel to the original trilogy - Foundation’s Edge - which I reviewed in Scrollof Set #IX-3, which in turn wascommented upon by Asimov. The series was merged with Asimov’s robot series [cf.#15D] in Foundation and Earth(NY: Doubleday, 1986), in which the ultimate justification for mankind’sgalactic unification is considered to be theeventual invasion of the Milky Way Galaxy by denizens from other galaxies.

In this collection of essays heexamines mankind’s prospects for a space-oriented culture, touching upon everything from intelligent dolphins toscenarios for communication with extra-terrestrials. While adhering to high standards of scientific precision, the bookis as conversational as the writings ofAsimov. Hence it is a pleasant introduction to ‘space-consciousness’. Alsohighly recommended is Sagan’s Cosmos(NY: Random House, 1980), the book version of the PBS television series Cosmos.And catch that series if you can.Sagan’s a little rough on Pythagoras, who he feels gave science a bum steer inthe direction of intuition & mysticisminstead of Aristotelian ‘scientific method’.

A short, succinct work written in acrisp, no-nonsense style.

Itinvolves, quite bluntly, a major re-writing of the history of western Europeancivilization. Until now, the“history of Europe” surveys taught in most universities have addressed thehistory of ChristianEurope: the feudal states and nations which emerged following the decline of theRoman Empire. Pre-Christian [or later non-Christian] Europe was considered “uncivilized”, hencegood for little other thana few anecdotes of marauding Goths, Vikings, Picts, and the like.The so-called “neo-pagan” or “Wiccan” religion invented by post-World War IIenthusiasts hasfurther confused the situation by representing a rag-bag of medieval and modernfables andsuperstitions as a quasi-unified, Hippie-type nature religion supposedlyprevalent throughout pre-Christian Europe. Nothing could be further from the truth. Although authoritiessuch as Elliot Rose(#6C) have long since exposed this sham, the Wiccan movement prances contentedlyalong, blissfullyundisturbed by inconvenient facts.Magus Flowers, in his years of research into ancient Europe, has uncovered thekey to theauthentic pre-Christian wisdom of that subcontinent. His work in this field isno less significantthan that of Champollion with the Rosetta Stone. His findings make possible, forthe first time,a true understanding of how the forces of the universe were understood by theEuropean cultures laterto be systematically exterminated by Christianity. We learn that these ancientEuropeans were not“savages” after all, but had developed cosmologies and philosophies assophisticated and subtle as thoseof the Maya and ancient China. While the Temple of Set has always accordedspecial honor to ancientEgypt, as the original source of our knowledge concerning the Gift of Set, weare no less sensitive to theperception and utilization of that Gift by many other cultures in othergeographic regions. What followsis a key to a door which has long been locked."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- by Stephen E. Flowers VI°Reason would seem to dictate that now that there are over a dozen of my workseither in print or presently insome stage of completion, the corpus of work should be put into some sort ofperspective. This perspective will showhow first this corpus represents a whole, crystallized and focused (if dynamic)vision, and how this vision is beingcast into the objective universe to do its work. For the direct effecting of theobjective universe is, indeed, one of thefacets of this corpus of work. This is similar to the attitude Aleister Crowleyhad toward his book projects [see #3V].However, all of this remains a vision still in emergence. The things I have doneup to now have been pieces of amuch vaster mosaic. Although the general outlines of this mosaic are clear tome, and so I can see how each of thenew pieces fits into the overall scheme, it may not be so for others. Therefore,in order not to leave it to futurehistorians to try to figure out what it is all about, I will here brieflyoutline the corpus of my work to date (to thebeginning of 1990) and the general scheme into which it fits. Only those workswhich have appeared incommercially published form will be cited. I will also provide some idea of thedirection this work will be going inthe future - although this aspect remains open to dynamic influences and couldchange course as new data flow in tobe coordinated.Underlying all of my works are several principles. Most important among these isthat there are certainhidden keys to initiation and to Becoming which I seek to find in the methodsfollowed in my work in general. Thechief element in this method is the dynamic synthesis of polar extremes - thetwo most important of these are thesubjective and objective universes. Reflections of this process run through thework - from the cosmological modelof fire and ice to the psycho-magical dichotomy of Huginn and Muninn, the twoOdian ravens. These represent therational, logical, analytical mind and the nœtic psyche and storehouse ofperceived eternal forms respectively. Themethod underlying all of my works is a planned and deliberate oscillationbetween logical procedure and nœticprocess.The simplest way to put this is that there is a moving back and forth of focusbetween the objectively,historically accurate aspects of a tradition and the subjective and vibrantaspects. It is in the eternal ebb and flow, inthe dynamic process - unending and without end - that the ultimate synthesis isfound - not in a state of being. Thisis the essence of what I call the “Polarian Method”.This can be seen in the corpus of material when one couples the contents ofRunes and Magic (written as aPh.D. dissertation according to strict scientific standards) with my first“runic trilogy”, ( Futhark, Runelore, and Atthe Well of Wyrd.) Runes and Magic is the crystalline focal point of thelogical, analytical end of the spectrum, whilethe “runic trilogy” is equally that for the nœtic, intuitive end. Once theentire corpus is viewed from this perspective,I think it takes on more of its meaning as a dynamic whole.Necessary to the use of this guide are a few words on how it can be used mostbeneficially. In general it followsthe same kind of plan as that of the rest of the Temple of Set Reading List. thecodes have been given as Order of theTrapezoid (TRP-) - as those are most harmonious with the overall contents ofthis list. If I were to advise someone- 247 -on a course to take in studying this corpus, I would say that Runelore, At theWell of Wyrd, and Futhark (in thatorder) would be the foundation. From there the priority codes could be used todetermine a useful ordering of theother works. [A full course of reading of most of the works on the list isincluded in the text of The Nine Doors ofMidgard.]All of the works presented here are in the order of their chronologicalappearance. In the commentaries, I notonly try to give a sense of the content and purpose of the work, but also showhow it relates to the others in the web-work. In conclusion the present a prospectus for future works and works inprogress.24A. Futhark: A Handbook of Rune Magic by Edred Thorsson. York Beach, ME:Weiser, 1984. (TOS-3)(TRP-2) SF: “In many ways this book would look much different if I were to writeit today. The MS for the work wasactually finished in 1979, but it was not published until 1984. [This work wasactually preceded by another book-length MS originally entitled A Primer of Runic Magic, finished in 1975.]Futhark remains a fertile field forexperimentation by free-lance rune magicians, but its contents are actually abit too influenced by the traditions ofthe Armanen to be entirely satisfactory to me now.”24B. Runelore: A Handbook of Esoteric Runology by Edred Thorsson. York Beach,ME: Weiser, 1986.(TOS-3) (TRP-1) SF: “Runelore is basically the lore-curriculum of the Rune-Gildin summary form. It contains acurrent view of historical runology, esoteric lore concerning the runes, as wellas Teutonic cosmology, psychologyand theology. It is the first of my works to have been completed after my entryinto the Temple of Set. Its contentsare basic and essential to understand before serious and authentic work can beundertaken with the Runes.”24C. Runes and Magic: Magical Formulaic Elements in the Older Runic Tradition byStephen E. Flowers.Berne: Peter Lang, 1986. (TOS-4) (TRP-5) SF: “This is the published form of mydissertation written at theUniversity of Texas at Austin. It represents an exhaustive study of the olderrunic inscriptions analyzed as magicalformulaic communications based on a semiotic theory of magic - magic as a systemof ‘inter-universalcommunication’ (subjective/objective). It contains introductory material on thetheory presented, and then appliesthat theory to the evidence of the actual inscriptions. This work is thought bymost to be a ‘difficult read’, and maybe quite hard to find by now. Only 250 copies were printed.”24D. At the Well of Wyrd: A Handbook of Runic Divination by Edred Thorsson. YorkBeach, ME: Weiser,1988. (TOS-3) (TRP-2) SF: “This was the third in the original ‘runic trilogy’,with the other two being Futhark andRunelore. This work takes a highly traditional look at the art and practice ofrunecasting and the laying of therunestaves.”24E. The Secret of the Runes by Guido von List. Translated and introduced byStephen E. Flowers. Rochester,VT: Destiny, 1988. (TOS-4) (TRP-4) SF: “In many ways I see my work as acontinuation - a Remanifestation - ofworks that have been undertaken by others in the past. From the most ancientancestral Runemasters, to theGerman and English Romantics, down to the early 20th century rune magicians ofGermany. The foundations forthis latter group were directly laid by Guido von List, who was certainly moreof a magician than he might at firstappear. This book is a historical and scientific study of List and his ideology,along with a translation of its mostfamous expression, Das Geheimnis der Runen.” DW: “This book is interesting as anexample of a Magus of theNorthern Tradition’s thoughts and methods - and the insights it gives to thesubjective side of reawakening atraditional system.”24F. The Truth about Teutonic Magick by Edred Thorsson. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn,1989. (TOS-4) (TRP-4)SF: “This little volume (25 pages) is really a general program for the ‘TeutonicMagick Series’ which I created and forwhich I am acting as a consulting and acquisitions editor for LlewellynPublications. In it can be found a generaloutline of the focus and scope of the practical/magical aspects of the overallwork. What also becomes obvious hereis that the work has expanded beyond that which I must personally undertake.Other magicians and writers havetaken up the banner and are moving outward into the world with it.”24G. The Galdrabok: An Icelandic Grimoire by Stephen Flowers. York Beach, ME:Weiser, 1989. (TOS-4)(TRP-4) SF: “This volume contains a translation (from Old Icelandic) of thecomplete text of a Scandinavian book ofmagic along with a collection of other magical spells and incantations ofsimilar natures. The work shows acontinuity of the Germanic (Northern) method of working magic carried over frompre-Christian times. There isalso an introductory section which gives a history of magic in Iceland inpost-Viking times.” DW: “A good source ofMedial Black Magic operations, useful for beginning your own Galdarbok.”24H. Rune Might: Secret Practices of the German Rune Magicians by EdredThorsson. St. Paul, MN:Llewellyn, 1989. (TOS-3) (TRP-4) SF: “This whole work really represents ahistorical footnote to the ‘runic trilogy’,as an outline and practical discussion of the magical methods of the early 20thcentury German rune magicians. Inmany ways this is the general and practical companion to The Secret of the Runesby Guido von List. The material- 248 -contained in Rune Might can also act as an effective bridge between the Germanictradition and the more usuallyfound ‘Western’ (really Southern) tradition.”24I. A Book of Troth by Edred Thorsson. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn, 1989. (TOS-5)(TRP-5) SF: “As Black Magichas existed, and does exist, in a variety of cultures and religious contexts -not only in those in which it is seen as aspiritually criminal kind of activity - this work seeks to help reestablish themore general White Magical (orReligious) tradition of the North. In this more healthy general context offormer days, the practice of Black Magicwas more completely supported by the common faith - even if it was just aslittle understood - and would certainlyagain find such support in a renewed system of the true faith of the Northshould it actually revive. It is to this endthat this book was cast upon the world.”24J. Fire and Ice: Magical Teachings of the Brotherhood of Saturn, Germany’sGreatest Secret Occult Orderby Stephen E. Flowers. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn, 1990. (TOS-1) (TRP-2) SF: “Thisis a general and fairlycomprehensive introduction to the history, ideology, structure and rituals ofthe Fraternitas Saturni, which is aThelemite (but non-Crowleyan) lodge which has dominated the German occult scenesince the time of its inceptionin the late 1920s. With this book, I took a step out and back to my occult rootsin the ‘mainstream’ western magicaltradition. One of the main reasons for undertaking this study and writing thisbook was to explore the way in whichan Æonic Word finds expression beyond the bounds of its Magus. A preface byMichael A. Aquino is scheduled toappear in future printings.” DW: “Michael Aquino’s preface is available fromRuna-Raven Press. Certaintechnologies from this book have been adapted with great success by Pylons suchas the Bull of Ombos and theBlack Phœnix. A good study of the Black Flame as perceived before the coming ofour Æon.”24K. Rune Song: A Practical Guide to Rune Galdor by Edred Thorsson. Smithville,TX: Runa-Raven Press,1993. (TOS-1) (TRP-1) SF: “Rune Song is a combination book and tape package. Ihave for a long time seen that thepronunciation of the now-exotic-sounding words and phrases of the Teutonictradition was felt to be a majorstumbling-block along the way to learning the lore. This project is designed toremedy that problem. Pronunciationof languages such as Proto-Germanic (the reconstructed language from which allGermanic tongues are derived),Old English, or Old Norse is usually the kind of thing only learned in the IvoryTowers of Academia. With RuneSong I hope to make this kind of information available beyond that sphere.”24L. The Nine Doors of Midgard by Edred Thorsson. Llewellyn, 1991. (TOS-3)(TRP-1) SF: “This is a basiccurriculum in magical training which takes the student from the beginning,assuming no prior training, and in astep-by-step fashion provides exercises and a curriculum of reading and othersorts of training so that by the end ofthe complete program it is possible to be considered for Naming as a Thegn orDrighten in the Rune-Gild. Thisprogram was ten years in the making, and will be published next year. In themeantime it is available for a donationto the Rune-Gild.”24M. The Book of Ogham by Edred Thorsson. Llewellyn, 1992. (TOS-1) (TRP-4) SF:“The first grandexperiment in the use of the Polarian method moving outside of the home base ofthe Germanic tradition into thekindred Celtic tradition. No magical tradition has been subject to morebastardization than the Celtic, so creating auseful synthesis according to my methods seems a worthwhile endeavor.” DW:“Persons interested in the matrixwhich produced Ogham may wish also to consult Celtic Heritage: Ancient Traditionin Ireland and Wales by Alwynand Brinley Rees. London: Thames & Hudson, 1961.”* * *Supplementary Works- by Stephen E. Flowers VI*There is a corpus of writing which is often essential to the fullestunderstanding of the depth of the Germanictradition, and which is not covered in the standard reading list of the Templeof Set. For a guide to these writings, Ihave provided this supplementary reading list. These works provide a largercontext for the understanding of manyworks in Runelore, and give us a deep level basis for the understanding of theNorthern (Indo-European-based)Tradition of the Black Art, which is distinguished in many ways from theSouthern (Middle Eastern-based)Tradition.24N. The Well and the Tree by Paul C. Bauschatz. Amherst: University ofMassachusetts Press, 1982. (TOS-3)(TRP-4) SF: “To date this is the most valuable study on the Germanic conceptionsof time and the structure of thecosmos. It is a highly scholarly text which nevertheless contains many insightsof direct magical use. Reviewed inRunes #VII-2 by Rebecca Lance IV°/M.Tr.” DW: “A good book for the Setian to lookat the force of What Has ComeInto Being ( Xeper) which the ancient Germans called ‘Weird’, and its powerfulinfluence on What Is To Be. Helpfulin throwing off mundane ideas of ‘fate’ and a fixed future.”- 249 -24O. Gods of the Ancient Northmen by Georges Dumezil, ed., tr. E. Haugen, et al.Berkeley: University ofCalifornia Press, 1973. (TOS-4) (TRP-3) SF: “This book outlines the connectionsof Germanic myth and religion withthe Indo-European tripartite socio-religious structure. This is not merely a‘survey’ of Germanic mythology likeother books with similar titles. It is an invaluable text to dispel notions thatthe gods are merely the simplepersonifications of natural forces, or the ‘deifications’ of mortal men.”24P. The Myth of the Eternal Return, or Cosmos and History by Mircea Eliade. (=Bollingen Series 46) tr. W.Trask. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1971 [1954]. (TOS-2) (TRP-4) SF:“All works by Eliade arerecommended, but this one is the one with which you should start. It exploresthe mythic meaning of ‘time’,‘history’, ‘the center’, etc. The ideas contained in this book are fundamentalto real understanding of mythictraditions, and necessary to learning ‘to think mythically’.”24Q. The Road to Hel by Hilda R. Ellis (Davidson). Cambridge: University ofCambridge Press, 1943. (TOS-4)(TRP-4) SF: “This is an important study of the Teutonic concepts of death, thesoul, and the other world(s).”24R. Teutonic Mythology by Jacob Grimm, tr. J.S. Stallybrass. New York: Dover,1966. 4 vols. (first published1835). (TOS-4) (TRP-4) SF: “Although some of this work is now out-of-date, itremains a veritable treasure-trove ofmaterial from every Teutonic tradition. It includes discussions of all thedeities and beings, cosmology, magic,herbs, etc.”24S. The Poetic Edda by Lee M. Hollander, tr. and ed. Austin, TX: University ofTexas Press, 1962. (TOS-3)(TRP-2) SF: “This is the best translation of the Elder Edda into English. Notonly is it quite accurate, but it alsogives a real feel for the form of the Old Norse poetry - and can in turn serveas a model for the composition ofmodern Eddic verse in English.”24T. A History of the Vikings by Gwyn Jones. Oxford: Oxford University Press,1968. (Also a second revisededition.) (TOS-4) (TRP-4) SF: “This is the best general history of the VikingAge available in English. It may beimportant for some Initiates to gain a fuller understanding for the lives andvalues of this last great pagan culture ofEurope.”24U. In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archæology and Myth by J.P.Mallory. London: Thames &Hudson, 1989. (TRP-4) SF: “This up-to-date survey of the whole spectrum ofIndo-European studies is essential tounderstanding the roots of Teutonic thought and society. It is from these seedsand from these roots that theTeutonic tree blooms; understand the seed and you understand the very core ofthe fruit.”24V. Volsunga Saga by William Morris, tr. Introduction and glossary by RobertGutman. New York: Collier,1962. (TOS-3) (TRP-3) SF: “Gutman’s introduction provides a fine historical,literary, and artistic background tothis great saga of the Teutonic peoples. Gutman compares the Volsunga Saga withthe German Nibelungenlied andwith Wagner’s treatment of the same themes. The saga itself is one of the mostimportant sources for understandingthe values of the Viking Age, and it certainly shows us how the Norsemen viewedtheir own broader Teutonicheritage. The story of a clannic line - with its divine descent (from Odhinn),and its vicissitudes, flowering anddecline - is the Teutonic soul epitomized. The saga is of central importance toall seeking the inner meaning of Xeperin the context of the Teutonic tradition.” DW: “Recommended for its portrayal ofXeper, as well as the polar conceptof the individual where one axis is ‘myth’ and the other ‘history’. Helpful foranyone planning to leave a magicallegacy on this Earth.”24W. The Prose Edda by Snorri Sturlson, tr. A.G. Brodeur. New York: TheScandinavian AmericanFoundation, 1929. (TOS-4) (TRP-3) SF: “This is by far the best and most completetranslation of the Younger Eddain English. It includes not only the Gylfaginning, but also the Skaldskaparmal(which is not completely provided inthe Jean I. Young translation. Especially useful are Brodeur’s interpretationsof the proper names in the text.”24X. Egil’s Saga by Snorri Sturlson, tr. H. Palsson and P. Edwards.Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976. (TRP-4)SF: “This saga is the greatest study of a rune magician from the elder age.There are many mysteries contained inthis saga - some of them not quite so obvious as the many times in which Egilluses rune magic and poetry to alterthe objective universe.” DW: “Good portrait of a Black Magician.”24Y. Myth and Religion of the North by E.O.G. Turville-Petre. New York: HoltRinehart & Winston, 1964.(TOS-4) (TRP-3) SF: “Turville-Petre’s book is the best survey of oldScandinavian religion in English, and anexcellent one by any standard. He discusses the sources of our knowledge, allthe divinities, the divine kings, heroes,guardian spirits, temples and objects of worship, sacrifice, death, andcosmogony and cosmology.”24Z. Runarmal-I: The Runa Talks (Summer 1991) by Stephen Edred Flowers.Smithville, TX: Runa-RavenPress, 1996. (TOS-1) DW: “This is the essential text for persons seeking Runa.It is much more universal than Magus- 250 -Flowers’ other books, and contains the essential relationship between Xeper andRuna. I consider it one of the mostimportant magical texts working in the world today.”24AA. Northern Magic by Edred Thorsson. St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1992. (TOS-3) DW:“An easy-to-readintroduction to Gothic magic through the ages. Also a good introduction to magicgenerally for novices.”24AB. Green Runa by Edred Thorsson. Smithville, TX: Runa-Raven Press, 1996.(TOS-3) DW: “This is acollection of Magus Flowers’ writings 1978-1985. It has many useful nuggets,such as: the importance of learninglanguages, a magical endeavor which Runa-Raven now supports by keeping acollection of learning aids for sale; ‘ACurious Curse Formula’ revealing the secret of the Nine Angles as an operanttechnology; material on holy signs;‘Rune-Wisdom and Race’ (a good essay for debunking the charge that you’re a Naziif you study the Runes); the Riteof Sumble; etc. A great supplement to any of Magus Flowers’ works. A magicalbiography of Magus Flowers byJames A. Chisholm, Honorary K.Tr., is included.”24AC. The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of theTheories of GeorgesDumezil by C. Scott Littleton. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973.(TOS-3) (SKM-3) DW: “This is the bestintroduction to the work of Dumezil, who opened the way for studyingIndo-European peoples. The discovery of thethreefold division that underlies the thought of ancient Germans, Latins, andIranians was Dumezil’s contribution tothe Reawakening (though he may have been influenced by #24E). Very littlematerial on the Germanic peoples inthis book, but very useful for understanding the Weird of the Indo-Europeans.”24AD. Black Runa by Stephen Edred Flowers. Smithville, TX: Runa-Raven Press,1995. (TRP-4) MA: “Apersonally-chosen selection of Magus Flowers’ essays for the Order of theTrapezoid during 1985-1989.”- 251 -A13: The First Year- by Michael A. Aquino V°Scroll of Set #I-10, June XI/1976It has now been almost a year since the reestablishment of the Temple of Set. Iwould like to review that year foryou, touching upon both the highlights and the problems we have experienced.Then I will outline the plans we havefor the next year, as well as some long-range projections. If you would like todiscuss any of this material in greaterdetail, feel welcome to contact the Priest or Priestess of Set nearest you.At this time last year the situation was chaotic. The Church of Satan haddisintegrated, and absolutely no plansfor a successor organization had been made. Until the appearance of the Book ofComing Forth by Night on thenight of June 21-22, almost no research into pre-Satan concepts had been done.Nor, upon close examination, wouldthe old administrative/ executive structures of the Church of Satan have been ofany use to the Temple of Set. Infact, they were practically non-existent, because the structure, Priesthood,program, membership, and policies of theChurch of Satan could be - and were - changed at a moment’s notice by decisionof Anton LaVey.Creating a new organization that would be merely a carbon copy of the old onewas out of the question, else wecould eventually expect to encounter the same problems as the Church of Satan.Moreover, the Æon of Set embodiesa sense of purpose or direction ( Xeper) that did not exist in the aimless,hedonistic Age of Satan. The Temple of Setwould have to be designed to grapple with problems and undertake projects thatwould have been completelybeyond the reach of the Church of Satan, as well as of any previous religious/philosophical group.And so we faced two general tasks: (1) Creation of the structure of the Templeof Set, and (2) Defining andintroducing the direction in which the Temple should be moving.The groundwork for the first task was laid in July, when the Priesthood workedout and approved a writtenframework for the Temple consisting of eight Articles of Incorporation and tenBy-Laws with 79 sections. Theseprovisions were given the force of law by incorporation of the Temple of Setwithin the State of California. ByOctober the Secretary of State formally approved the Temple of Set as alegitimate religious institution, thusgranting us full rights as a tax-exempt, non-profit organization.This was, however, just the beginning. In the Church of Satan the Priesthood hadno voice in the running of theorganization, and the Council of Nine was merely an informal sounding-board forthe High Priest. In the Temple ofSet the Priesthood has had to accustom itself to possessing and using a greatdeal of influence over the entireTemple, and the Council of Nine is now in a position where it holds ultimateresponsibility for the administration ofthe Temple - being distinct from and superior to the office of the High Priest.Hence there was an urgent need for the high-speed transmission of informationthroughout the III°+ levels ofthe Temple. To meet this need I sent out a series of bulletins from my office,keeping the Priesthood advised onmoment-to-moment developments. I have also corresponded extensively with ourofficials, amassing a 12-monthfile of letters that is about the size of a major city’s telephone book!Individual officials have also beencommunicating just as extensively with one another - something that neverhappened in the Church of Satan. Theeffect of this is extremely important, although it may not be automaticallyapparent to the general membership: It isthat every initiate to the Setian Priesthood, whatever his location, possesses afull and reliable understanding of thedesign of the Temple of Set and its position at a current point in time.All administrative services of the Temple to the general membership are nowbeing coordinated through a newoffice - that of Executive Director. Priest William F. Murray, who holds thisposition, has made it the veritablenerve-center of our operations, controlling and/or coordinating finances,supplies, insignia, special researchprojects, records, and an endless parade of special-action developments.Working closely with the Executive Director are a growing number of specializeddepartments, councils, andcommissions across the continent. Data-processing is handled by MagisterGrumboski in Michigan. The Scroll ofSet is edited and published in San Jose, California, by Magistra Wendall. Plansfor a research data bank are beingdeveloped in San Francisco by Priest R.K. Barrett. Council of Nine operationsare being developed by the Chairman,Magister Ethel, in Washington, D.C. Scientific research is being done by PriestHolt in Georgia. Ceremonial andritual magic matters are coordinated by Priest DeCecco in Massachusetts.Communications systems are beingevaluated by Priest Harris in Los Angeles. Long-range financial work is beingdone by our Treasurer, MagisterSeago, in Santa Barbara. Magistra Sinclair, also in Santa Barbara, will beadministering our discount/ direct-purchasing book-order system [to be instituted this summer].The latest special agency of the Temple is the Department of ContingencyPlanning, headed by Priest Norton inMichigan. The DCP is divided into a number of functional divisions, eachconcerned with specific matters withwhich the Temple may have to deal in the future.What makes these accomplishments all the more impressive is the fact that theTemple is still relatively small insize. At this time last year the mailing list of the Church of Satan containedabout 350 names, of which about 100were either complimentary memberships or non-member subscriptions to the ClovenHoof. Only the 250 regularmembers were told about the Temple of Set, and then only about fifty of themwere accepted into the Temple asqualified initiates. The entire process of notification, information,application, and selection took about the first fouror five months, and since then we have grown by about 30 additional Initiates.This is due in large part to our- 252 -refusal to advertise, employ sensational publicity, or otherwise seek members byany “mass” process. We believethat each new Setian should be introduced to the Temple on an individual basis.Thus the Temple will growrelatively slowly, but the quality and interest of its initiates will be high.The problems we have encountered fall generally under the heading of “growingpains”. On occasion it has notbeen clear what the extent and limits of a given official’s authority are, orwhat others should be involved, or whatstandards Initiates of various degrees are expected to observe. There are a fewpeople doing a lot of work and a lot ofpeople doing less. As yet we do not have a system for bringing the Temple of Setto the attention of qualified personswho may not know one of our present Initiates. These are things we must work outas we go along, being careful toavoid over-reaction to any one incident.I am somewhat cautious in predicting the exact course of events in our secondyear, because so much hashappened in the last twelve months that was far beyond our initial speculations.Yet certain concrete goals can beidentified: Our first book-length document, The Book of Coming Forth by Night:Analysis and Commentary, is nowavailable to Initiates. By fall we hope to have the initial edition of the RubyTablet of Set, a cumulative encyclopediafor our Initiates, ready for release. Designed in loose-leaf format, the RubyTablet will be added to and revised overthe years in order to reflect the very latest information at our disposal. Laterthis summer an expanded and revisedreading list will be distributed, and a limited system of book-ordering by mailat a below-retail discount will beattempted. If it works well, we will gradually expand the system to everyavailable book on our reading list.Almost all of our informational papers will be revised and updated. Highpriority will go to increasing thebudget of the Scroll of Set. Via the Ruby Tablet additional material on ritualmagic will be circulated. We hope toput out some general guidelines on local financing, regional conclaves, and therights and responsibilities of theTemple as a tax-exempt religious organization. And, of course, all of theoperations that the Temple has begun thisyear will continue to grow in their own areas.As a Setian you are welcome to participate in whatever activities of the Templeyou find most interesting - or torecommend new ones in which you might like to concentrate your own endeavors.For names and addresses ofofficials in each area, contact the Priest or Priestess with whom you areworking and explain your special interests.But don’t sit back and expect the Temple to entertain you “$15 worth each year”,because that is not the way aninitiatory religious society works. The initiative for your advancement andeducation rests with you; the Temple is asort of “institutional accessory” to help you.One year ago none of us expected that the Temple of Set would come this far insuch a short time. What will it belike in another year, another ten years, a hundred years? I can’t venture aspecific guess, but I can tell you that it willbe totally unlike any institution this planet has ever seen before - except forthe first Temple of Set. Xeper.- 253 -A14: Psychic Hazards & Proper Use of Ritual Magic- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #I-3, November 1975During the course of a recent guest appearance on a radio talk show, a womancalled in on the telephone andasked me if I were aware of the “psychic hazards” inherent in the practice ofSatanism and Black Magic.I must confess that her question jolted me a little. Having been so long andhappily practicing these arts myself,it becomes easy to forget occasionally that there are still some people whoclaim to have studied the subject in depthand yet still adhere to such archaic, obsolete ideas. On examination of theideas themselves, however, it becomesapparent that these people simply do not understand the actual nature of theperils against which they so ardentlywarn us. I therefore feel it is time for the matter to be presented from theinside, from the point of view of thepracticing Black Magician rather than that of someone who has only skimmed thesurface of the subject.So what about these dangers, then? Do they in fact exist? Yes, they do, in muchthe same sense that if you tell achild a frightening story, he will have a nightmare. [To see just howappropriate an analogy this is, examine in thelight of logic and contemporary scientific knowledge the philosophical bases ofthe average Wiccan or other “white-light” occultist’s beliefs.]The principal hazards cited by occult “authorities” generally fall into twocategories: the summoning orinadvertent arousal of uncontrolled forces or entities which will turn up anddestroy the would-be magician, andpossession by some malevolent force or entity. The proficient black magicianrecognizes both concepts as theabsurdities they are, yet these things do seem to happen to some who attempt touse magic. Why?The first reason is the manner in which the average person approaches thepractice of sorcery. He is the victimof a Judæo-Christian religious and moral tradition which conditions him tobelieve that man alone is nothing, thathe must place his trust and reliance in a power or being outside himself. He isalso led to believe that sorcerousdelvings are sinful and forbidden and will lead to the inevitable destruction ofthe student. A resultant attempt tojustify such experimentation is the current emphasis on “White” magic.If the student has been lucky enough to avoid a Judæo-Christian type ofindoctrination, he is still generallyensnared by a magical orientation based on the same principles and teaching thatsome forces are “good” and others“evil”, and that he should concern himself exclusively with the good or“positive” and avoid the evil or “negative”. Itis easy to see how this approach to morality and magic leads to frustration andto the repression of perfectly naturalfeelings and desires - such as lust and anger - into the subconscious. These maylater erupt from within as twistedmonsters, dæmons, elementals, or powerful compulsions and obsess the student.St. Jerome’s account of histemptation in the desert is an excellent illustration of this:How often when I was living in the desert, in the vast solitude which gives tohermits a savagedwelling ... how often did I fancy myself among the pleasures of Rome! ... WhenI had no companions butscorpions and wild beasts, I found myself among bevies of girls. My face waspale and my frame chilled withfasting, yet my mind was burning with desire and the fires of lust kept bubblingup before me when my fleshwas as good as dead.Indeed, the entire history of the Middle Ages is a case in point, as G. RattrayTaylor so well points out:In the earlier part of the Middle Ages what we chiefly find is frank sensuality,with which the church atfirst battles in vain. Then, as it improves its systems of control, we find amounting toll of perversion andneurosis.Springing as they do from the depths of the subconscious mind, these monstersmay be powerful indeed. Thestudent, unwilling to admit that such things could arise from within himself,naturally prefers to perceive them assome sort of Influence from Outside. The student who encounters such phenomenais often too shaken toexperiment further, and, bound by repressive conditioning, never penetrates pastthese shadows to confront theawesome majesty of his true nature.So much for these “monsters from the id”. If the practice of sorcery iscorrectly approached, you will probablynever be confronted by them. If you are, then recognition of their actual natureshould enable you to easily dispelthem. If it does not, then you are the type of person who is likely to becomepossessed.Possession is supposedly the control of a human being by some outsideintelligence, demon, or even the Devilhimself. Now, logically speaking, one would think that any Devil worth his saltwould find better things to do withhis time than invade someone’s body and terrify his friends and neighbors intoscurrying for the nearest clergymanand Getting Right with God. Such a project would be senseless andself-defeating.We will understand the situation more clearly if we once again look withinourselves rather than outside. What Ihave said above concerning subconscious repression of elements of the psychewhich are regarded as undesirable isjust as applicable here, but so is an additional factor: the desire forattention and recognition. Let’s face it - beingpossessed by the Devil, here and now, is far more exciting than having beenBridey Murphy or an Atlantean High- 254 -Priest in a fantasized former lifetime. In addition, possession frees the“victim” from all responsibility for hisactions: he is not the one who murdered his mother [whom he secretly hated foryears]; it was the dæmon whocontrolled him.Possession allows one to express himself in socially-unacceptable ways and getaway with it. It allows one tobathe in attentive sympathy or to provoke fear in those one dislikes, and givesone an excuse and sense of purposefor his otherwise-useless existence and his inability to cope with the pressuresof life. In short, possession is neverthe “victim’s” problem; rather it is his subconscious solution to problems andconflicts which he cannot resolve inany other way. A good idea catches on quickly, too: remember the rash of“possession” cases following the release ofThe Exorcist?The approach of the Setian to the sorcerous arts is from a basis of rationalawareness which allows him to avoidthe pitfalls which entrap others. He places no reliance or dependence on anyforce outside himself. A materialist, herecognizes from the outset that the powers with which he deals are his own. Heperceives “God” as simply thenatural order of things: a mindless, non-conscious, impersonal cosmos which isin no way concerned with him orwith anything he may do.The Prince of Darkness is seen as a finite intelligence greater than that ofman, but is viewed as a guide andmentor in no way “supernatural” and certainly not a “reverse Jehovah” to beblindly worshipped and obeyed. In theBiblical myth, Satan was cast out of heaven because he decided that, rather thanserve God, he wanted to become agod himself. The Setian finds an allegorical inspiration in this and feels hecan do no less if he is to be worthy of thetitle. The Dark Lord having infused man with knowledge and intelligence, whichis what separates man from thenatural order (the Biblical account, though a myth, is at least correct in thatrespect), man now has the key to turnthe universal inertia to his amusement and make of the Universe his playground:to become, in short, a divine beingin his own right.To worship the Prince of Darkness in the Judæo-Christian sense of the term wouldrestrict the magician’s ownevolution and the development of his own powers and capabilities; hence theSetian does all he can to become moregodlike by working to develop his mind and his abilities, and by learning toexert an increasing control over himself,his environment, and his chosen sphere of social influence.In a ritual context the Setian may use candles and incantations and call thenames of various demons from anumber of different myth-cycles. He may even invent his own. However these aremerely psychological propsdesigned to stimulate the flow of emotional force which will ensure a successfulmagical working. He deliberatelyengages in a form of controlled, constructive fantasy in order to attain veryreal objective ends. And, because herecognizes it for the fantasy it is, he is able to manipulate it in any way hedesires and control it rather than beingcontrolled by it.The practice of Setian ritual magic, in a nutshell, involves the deliberaterelease of forces from the Dæmonic orsubconscious personality under conditions which are controlled by the magician.This has two principal effects onthe practitioner: first, instead of driving a wedge between the conscious andsubconscious and setting them againsteach other, it causes them to work together, unifying and strengthening theentire personality. This in turn results inthe development in the practitioner of abilities, powers of concentration, andforms of will completely unknown tohim before.Magical rituals are not valid for influencing the Prince of Darkness; nor arethey intended to do so. No entity asadvanced and sophisticated as Set is likely to be impressed by ceremonialtheatrics. Ritual magic procedures are atool for the magician’s personal use, which he can employ as a means of learningto focus his will and accomplish hisgoals. Once a certain evolutionary level is reached, he will find that they areno longer necessary to produce effectswhich he formerly could not obtain without them.Paradoxical though it may seem, it is at this point that ritual may become mostmeaningful to the practitioner.He comes to perceive the dæmonic entities on whom he calls for aid as symbolicrepresentations of aspects of hisown personality, and the ritual now serves to make him totally conscious of theglory of his own unique Self.He realizes that he has no need to ask favors of the Prince of Darkness, for henow knows - and demonstrates inevery aspect of his existence - that the greatest gift of Set has already beenbestowed upon him: the full awareness ofthe power of his own Will. Such a Setian has become Elect.- 255 -A15: The Gods of Christmas- by Margaret Wendall IV°Scroll of Set #I-4, December 1975“In the latter days a pure virgin shall conceive, and when the child is born astar will appear. When you beholdthe star follow wheresoever it shall lead you and adore the child, offeringgifts with humility. He is the AlmightyWord which created the Heavens.” This prophesy came true on the Winter Solstice,December 25th by the Juliancalendar. The god was called the “Unconquered Sun” and founded a religion basedon aspirations of moral purityand the hope of immortality. He initiated several sacraments, among them baptismand the use of consecratedbread, wine and water. His worship included both communion and fasts; theleaders of his faith - both men andwomen - were celibate, and his priests were called, “Father”. He was regarded asthe mediator between god andman, and he gave his life to ensure mankind’s future happiness.Jesus? No - Mithra, the founder of a religion at least 600 years older thanChristianity. Mithraism, whichcontains many elements borrowed by Christianity, was a very real threat to theearly Christian Church Fathers, whocalled it a “work of the Devil” to seduce men from what Christians consideredthe “true faith”. Mithraism wasforcefully suppressed in the Mediterranean regions by the time of Constantine.He was born in a cave when his father went to the city to pay taxes. His birthwas saluted by angels, and a lightshone in the heavens. His parents were visited by a prophet who proclaimed thenew-born child’s divine descent.His family fled to avoid persecution by a wicked king.Jesus? No - Krishna, whose birthday is celebrated on the 25th day of Savarana,which corresponds to ourDecember, and which is the Winter Solstice. Krishna’s life parallels Jesus’; inHinduism he is regarded as anincarnation of god, and is called “He who takes away the sins of the world”.Millions of his followers still celebratehis birthday by decorating their homes and by the presentation of gifts torelatives and friends.He was born of a virgin at the Winter Solstice. His birth was heralded by a starand singing angels. A wise manvisited him at his birth and prophesied greatness. His followers call him the“Key of Righteousness”.Jesus? No - the Buddha, whose life greatly parallels Jesus’ life. Today, manyBuddhists not only celebrate theBuddha’s birthday, but their own, on January First, just eight days from the oldWinter Solstice, and in JapaneseBuddhism, “Bodhi Day” is December 8th. Both Buddhism and Christianity have“overcome” obstacles in their pathsby absorbing them into their traditions, and today there are as many Buddhistsects as there are Christiandenominations [although Buddhists of one sect treat others with a respecttotally lacking in Christianity].“Unto us a child is born this day!” In pre-Christian Rome this song was commonlyheard on the Winter Solstice,December 25th, the birthday of the Sun. The festival was held during Saturnalia,and both were national festivals.All work stopped, and all roles were reversed. Master became slave and slavebecame master, a mock king whorepresented Saturn, god of sowing and husbandry, was elected.In Egypt a Solar Nativity Ritual was celebrated on December 24th at midnight,when people walked through thestreets singing: “The Virgin has brought forth! The light is waxing!” Isis, themother of Horus, is sometimes picturedwith the child Horus in her arms, wearing a crown circled with twelve stars, nottoo vaguely reminiscent of Christianpictures of Mary.The Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus is traditionally said to have wept beforehis crucifixion, was sacred tothe god Adonis, whose birthday was celebrated at the Winter Solstice inJerusalem. Adonis was Astarte’s lover;Astarte was the eastern Mediterranean Venus, or Morning Star. The word“Bethlehem” (the traditional birthplace ofJesus) means “House of Bread”, and Adonis was also god of corn.Many other gods, too numerous to be named, are reputed to have been born at theWinter Solstice. Nearly everyspiritual religion, major and minor, has had at least one god born at the WinterSolstice, when the “old Sun” diedand a “new Sun” was reborn.The first Christians did not celebrate Christmas because they did not believethat Jesus was a god. He was notdeified until 325 CE, at which time his birth was celebrated on January 6th.Pope Julius I moved Jesus’ birthday toDecember 25th in an attempt to assimilate non-Christians and to preventChristians from participating in the olderfestivals of the Solar birthday. Pope Leo the Great rebuked Christians forplacing more emphasis on the birth of theSun than on “the one who created the Sun”.Christians for centuries have accepted December 25th as the birth- day of Jesuson blind faith, although there isno real evidence anywhere to support the claim that he was born on that day.Astronomical evidence indicates thatJesus was not even born in 1 A.D.! Some authorities believe that the entirelegend of Jesus’ birth is composed oflegends borrowed from other faiths combined with astrological computations - allof which have been fictionalizedand personified by theological writers. Christmas is observed on December 25thbecause of the shrewd observationof the early Christian fathers that if Christianity were to conquer the world,it would have to relax some of its too-rigid principles and accept at least the old holidays, turning them intoChristian festivals with the same meanings.Should Setians celebrate Christmas? To celebrate it as the birthday of Jesuswould be pure hypocrisy for us, whobelieve the birth of Jesus as god to be mere legend. But there is no reason forus not to celebrate the South (Winter)Solstice. There is no reason for a Setian not to send greeting cards torelatives and friends at this time of year, or to- 256 -attend the office party, or even to have a “Solstice Tree”. In fact not doingthese things would set us apart from therest of our community and make us look suspicious in the eyes of our neighbors.This particular South Solstice we have something of our own to celebrate. TheÆon of Set is six months old. Thismay make our Temple sound like a mere babe-in-arms in comparison to the otherreligions of the world, but theannouncement of the Æon six months ago has far greater implications for theworld than all of them combined. Wewho are Setians are at last freed to Become.- 257 -A16: Set and the Creation of the Universe- by Robert Ethel IV°Scroll of Set #I-4, December 1975In 1931 Carl Anderson, an American physicist, discovered the existence ofpositively-charged electrons. Untilthis time electrons had been known only as negatively-charged “particles” [thepurpose of the quotation marks willbecome clear later] in orbit around a nucleus in an atom. Anderson was studyingcosmic-ray electrons passingthrough a strong magnetic field, and noticed that while one-half of theelectrons were bent as would be expectedaccording to their charge, the other half were bent in an exactly oppositedirection, indicating an opposite charge.These positively charged electrons became known as “positrons” (sort ofanti-electrons).This shed some light on Dirae’s “hole” theory in that these positrons were latershown to behave in the samemanner as the “holes” postulated by Dirae. Later experiments showed thatpositrons could be produced bybombarding metal plates with gamma rays. Simply, a gamma ray striking thenucleus of an atom has all of its energyconverted into electrons (e-) and positrons (e+). Both of these particles arecast off from the atom to be eliminatedby other atoms. The electrons collide with other electrons and eventually findhomes in other atomic structures. Thepositrons collide with other electrons to produce gamma rays. One positroncolliding with one electron producestwo gamma rays proceeding in opposite directions from one another. Consideringthe density of electronssurrounding us, it is easy to see that positrons are annihilated or convertedalmost instantaneously.In October 1965 Emilio Segre discovered negatively-charged protons, and laternegative or anti-neutrons. It hassince been determined that all of the recently discovered particles have theiropposites or anti’s.Now, since anti-particles have been proven to exist, what about our Universe?First let us look at the “creation”of the Universe in terms of “Genesis II” from the Cloven Hoof #IV-7. We willbriefly restate the theory to serve as apoint of reference:In the “beginning” the Universe was filled with radiation. This radiation becamepartially transformed intoequal amounts of matter and antimatter. The particles thus formed began to drawtoward each other, and toward acenter. During this process, particles of matter met other particles of matterand fused yielding larger bodies ofmatter. The same occurred with the antimatter. Matter met antimatter in somecases, and both were “annihilated”forming radiation. Eventually, the radiation pressure became greater than theforce of attraction between theparticles and bodies proceeding toward the common center, and caused them toretreat from each other. The “body”formed by the proximity of the particles attracted to each other is basicallywhat George Gamow termed an “ylem” inhis “big bang” theory of universal expansion.But is the Universe made up of both matter and antimatter? We do not know, and,to date, there does notappear to be any way to prove it. We know that our solar system is composedentirely of matter; equally, we arefairly certain that our entire galaxy is composed only of matter [if this werenot the case, we would detect intensegamma radiation from all parts of the galaxy - even considering the distancesbetween atoms in inter-galacticspace]. Considering that there is more evidence to support the existence ofproportional amounts of matter andantimatter in the Universe, we shall adopt this for use in our theories.In the beginning was the radiation, and the energy was without mass. And theenergy came together to formmatter and antimatter.[0=+1-1]By way of explanation let us bring up the “law of the conservation of mass &energy” developed from the “law ofthe conservation of mass” and the “law of the conservation of energy.” Brieflyit states that mass and energy cannever be created or destroyed, but they can be converted from one to the other.Utilizing this Law we get:E=m+awhere E = energy - in terms of mass, 0; m = matter or +1; and a = antimatter or-1. Hence:0=+1-1=The creation of the Universe from “nothing”.In 1906 Albert Einstein developed his theory of the relationship between massand energy:E = mc2where E = energy, m = mass, and c = velocity of light. Stated briefly, anyappearance of energy is necessarilyaccompanied by the disappearance of a small amount of mass.A French physicist named Louis de Broglie suggested that electrons were notparticles but rather waves. Thisfouled up the entire system of thinking that had considered electrons to belittle hard spheres.Later a Viennese physicist named Schrodinger developed de Broglie’s idea into asystem termed “wavemechanics”. This system explained quantum phenomena by attributing the functionsof waves to protons andelectrons. [What is quantum? I hear you cry. Quantum theory is the theory thatenergy does not flow smoothly in- 258 -arbitrarily small amounts from the radiating body, but flows in the form ofparticles or quanta. Quantum is thesingular of quanta.]Thus electrons became viewed as undulating charges of electrical energy, andatoms as systems of waves. Thistends to simplify and explain the “law of the conservation of mass and energy”as stated earlier.Now you are probably wondering where Set comes into all of this.In the beginning was Set, and Set was without form. He came together in creationto give rise to HarWer, thatSet might define himself.Set is the ageless intelligence - a form of energy. In the beginning Set equaled0, nothing in terms of mass. Increation he united with himself to give rise to mass and anti-mass - matter andantimatter (HarWer).Set continues in the form of energy while he continues in the form of mass, andhe continually converts fromone to the other [see the “law of the conservation of mass and energy” andE=mc2]. Hence, with the creation of theUniverse came the definition of Set (potentially), and this creation was fromSet whose existence was as nothing.I am the Ageless Intelligence of the Universe. I created HarWer that I mightdefine my Self.But HarWer, my opposite Self, is a strange and fitful presence. I, Set am mySelf distinct from the orderof the cosmos, yet am ordered in and of my Self. HarWer I was when I was oncepart of the cosmos andcould achieve identity only by becoming what the cosmic order was not. By HarWerI cancelled theimbalance, leaving a void in which true creation could take form as Set.- Book of Coming Forth by NightThe first part of the above quote is explained in the preceding paragraph. Thesecond part is, however, a bitconfusing. Set states that he is distinct from the order of the cosmos. Thisappears to contradict what we have statedearlier (i.e. that Set continues in the form of energy while he continues in theform of mass).Before we get involved in this, let us start at the beginning of the second partof the quote: “But HarWer, myOpposite Self, is a strange and fitful presence.” Set, in the form of energy,gave rise to HarWer (matter/antimatter).HarWer’s purpose was [and is] to define Set, and this is accomplished by the useof opposites [i.e. day has nomeaning without the existence of night]. When Set is energy, HarWer ismatter/antimatter, and vice versa.The Universe is basically ordered, but there are certain things that disruptthis order [we will not even considermankind!]. The existence of antimatter (anti-particles) in a system composedentirely of matter is one suchdisruption. Hence HarWer as a “strange and fitful presence”.“I, Set, am my Self distinct from the order of the cosmos, yet am ordered in andof my Self.” Contradiction of ourabove statements? No! By means of explanation let us define “order”. Accordingto Funk and Wagnall’s StandardEncyclopedic Dictionary, “order” is defined as “a condition in which there is amethodical, proper, or harmoniousarrangement of things”. We shall discount “methodical” and “proper” and concernourselves with “harmonious”.The same source defines “harmonious” as “made up of sounds, colors, or otherelements that combineagreeably ...” The key word here is “agreeably”. When matter and antimattercollide, they produce an explosion,which we hardly find agreeable if we do not plan it.Remember we are concerned with Set and the creation of the Universe; the“creation” of matter [andantimatter], and - since we are matter [most of us are anyway] - we are ergoconcerned with ourselves.Since Set has communicated with us [through the Book of Coming Forth by Night],he is concerned with us.Therefore our opinions count, and if we consider something disagreeable, it isdisagreeable. Set as an Intelligence isobviously able to think, in which case he must consider some thingsdisagreeable. Hence Set is “distinct from theOrder of the Cosmos” as man is distinct from the order of the cosmos [we do manythings which are against logicand order].Set is “ordered in and of himself” as man is ordered in and of himself. Any“Intelligence” is in a sense un-orderlyin that the intelligence gives it the ability to defy the order.“HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos ...” When Set was totally ofthe cosmos [”Cosmos” isdefined, again by Funk and Wagnall’s, as “the world or universe considered as anorderly system” (emphasismine)]. I.e. when Set was pre-intelligence, he was merely radiation which waspartially converted to matter/antimatter (HarWer) according to the above stated “law of the conservation ofmass and energy”. Set was HarWer(and Set) in the “beginning”.“... and could achieve identity by becoming what the cosmic order was not.” Thecosmic order was radiation. Toachieve identity [by utilizing HarWer] Set had to become matter/antimatter(HarWer) which the cosmic order at thetime was not.“By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a void in which true creationcould take form as Set.” Bybecoming HarWer, Set cancelled the imbalance by becoming mass, along withenergy. [Back to the “law”.] This left a“void” in the sense that “void” is defined as “a breach of surface or matter”[again Funk and Wagnall’s]. Theconversion of matter to energy leaves a “void”. Similarly the conversion ofenergy to matter leaves a “void”. [Soundsa little like Dirac’s “hole” theory.]By creating this “void” in such a manner, the way is established in which “truecreation” can “take form as Set”.We are now back at the beginning and the creation of the Universe.Xepert!

Roland Holt III°Scroll of Set #I-8, April 1976Among the abilities necessary for the performance of successful ritual magic aretwo which are very infrequent:mental concentration and vivid visualization.In light of this fact it would seem that more magicians would actively seek todevelop these abilities inthemselves than do. Why they do not is a mixture of three reasons: human inertia(i.e. it’s hard work), aphilosophical distaste for techniques by meditative Eastern religions, and -most infrequently - possession of inborntalent so that artificial development is not necessary.If you can already visualize whatever scene you desire at will with utmostvividness, then read no further. But ifyou cannot, then you should know that there are exercises you can use to developyour mental imagery to greatervividness.In the Church of Satan yoga was avoided because of its linkage withphilosophically-repugnant religions. Andindeed most of yoga is useless to the Black Magician. It should, however, benoted that yoga of all types played avery major role in Crowley’s system.There is one branch of yoga which should be of great interest to us: Raja Yoga -or, in English, mentalconcentration and development exercises. Let me point out that I am notadvocating mantra chanting or octopus-like body postures. What I am advocating is a series of exercises designed toconcentrate the normal mental“flashlight beam” until it has the strength and brilliance of a laser.The assimilation of these techniques from the East need not include any of the[falsely] related philosophy. Ifthe Red Chinese developed a new weapon, it would be insane for us to refuse todevelop our own version of itbecause the original was “contaminated” by “Mao is god” propaganda.For several years I myself have used mental concentration exercises and foundthem extremely helpful inachieving more intense levels of concentration and visualization in the ritualchamber. It seems logical to me that ifone thoroughly practices his magical “scales”, he will be more able to play amagical “symphony” at a later date. Forthis reason I would like to bring these techniques to the attention of theTemple membership, and to present briefinstructions and hints for those who are interested.So, assuming that one is interested in developing a Setian set (!) ofconcentration exercises, how does he goabout it?Firstly particular areas of weakness should be ascertained. Can you blank yourmind at will? Can you retain aclear visual image for a few minutes? But whatever you do, don’t just assume youcan. Try it and see. If you don’tlike what you find when you test yourself, here is an outline for a series ofexercises:(1) Learn to be fully conscious of what you are thinking and doing, when youwish to be conscious of it.(2) Next sit quietly and watch the flow of thoughts through your mind, trying atall times to be fully aware ofwhat you are thinking. The goal of both of the above exercises is to ensure yourawareness of your own mental andphysical functions: to ensure that you do not get carried away by a thoughtwhich you do not intend to think.(3) Having mastered watching the flow of your thoughts, learn to stop your mindupon a particular thought atwill and follow it with full intent. This exercise is mastered if, when desired,you can follow one particular thoughtfor ten minutes with no extraneous thought intruding.(4) Learn to reject all thoughts and to blank your mind. This is perhaps themost difficult of the exercises listedso far and will not be quickly mastered, but it is essential to clear imageformation. Let me draw an analogy. If onewishes to draw a picture upon a blackboard, he must first erase that blackboard.Once you can erase yourblackboard, the time for drawing begins.(5) Learn to visualize things, people, places, and scenes “as clearly as if youwere there”. You should start at thebottom and work up. Begin visualizing spoons, matches, and so forth, moving onlater to people and other largeobjects. When you can retain a clear image for a few minutes, you have masteredthis exercise.Let me point out that these exercises are work: they are not “fun” to do. Justlike the countless hours of practicerequired to be proficient in the martial arts, concentration exercises requiretenacity, will, and a firm desire toincrease one’s magical abilities.I strongly recommend the mental [and these only!] development exercises in thefirst three steps of FranzBardon’s Initiation into Hermetics. Bardon was, as I have remarked before,exceedingly “white” and - most anypsychiatrist would judge - insane. His works must be approached by the BlackMagician with extreme care for thesereasons. The book is fun to read in English because of the oft-times ludicroustranslation from the German.Also worth having is Christmas Humphreys’ Concentration and Meditation.Humphreys was a Buddhist andthis distasteful philosophy contaminates the whole work, yet there are manyworthwhile hints in it.I have presented the basics here. If you are interested, the way is open to you.As usual, any questions orcomments are welcome, and I will answer them as soon as I can.- 261 -A18: Austin Osman Spare: For Those Artistically Minded- by Leon Marvell I°Scroll of Set #I-10, June 1976Imagine a canvas upon which strange faces appear from within storms of vibrantcolor. Around thesemysterious visages swirl twisted limbs and grotesque exaggerations of the humanform. Perhaps the shapes withinare human, perhaps not; one is never sure. The painting might be called erotic,certainly it is unnerving in anindefinable way, and to the unaware it might be classified in dualistic moralterms as “evil.”The painting I have just described is a work by Austin Osman Spare. It is one ofmany on similar themes andexecuted for a singular purpose: It is a work in the magical system of asorcerer who has only very recently receivedany attention in occult circles.The son of a City of London policeman, Spare was born at midnight on the lastday of 1888. He showedexceptional artistic ability when very young, and in his early teens won ascholarship to the Royal College of Art. Thegreat painter John Singer Sargent hailed Spare as a “genius”. Spare was not yet19 years old.In the early 1930s Professor Mario Praz in his The Romantic Agony describedAustin Spare as a “Satanicoccultist”. An impressive title, and Spare was an impressive man.He was a powerful mystic, having a strong romantic streak as all true sorcerersmust have - that refusal to takethings at face value, the sense of meaning and purpose. He claimed to be areincarnation of William Blake and was,perhaps, considerably influenced by his predecessor [although his work, if itresembled any other artist at all,reminds me much more of Hieronymous Bosch].Spare claimed that at a very early age he was befriended by a “Mrs. Peterson”who was a witch and initiated himinto the secrets of magic. From this moment onwards, until he died the death ofthe poverty-stricken in 1956, Sparenever ceased to be wholly devoted to the Black Arts.He was for a short time a member of Crowley’s Order of the A.'.A.'. However hebroke with Crowley, possiblybecause of a personality clash, but most probably because he disapproved ofCrowley’s “Hermeticism” andCabalism. Spare was already developing an intensely powerful and individualsystem of his own that rejected alltime-honored “Rosicrucian” traditions and, in preference, utilized the ideas ofFreud and Jung. [I am not sure of theJungian influence; however, it would have lent support to his ideas of atavisms- the archetypes of the collectiveunconscious.] Crowley later reproduced some of Spare’s drawings in The Equinoxand his Manual of Geomancy.Spare’s magical system evolved through his first important work, The Book ofPleasure (Self-Love), publishedprivately in 1913, and later in The Focus of Life. Two concepts were basic tohis philosophy: those of Zos and Kia.Zos was the self considered as a whole - that is, the entire life of anindividual, a succession of existences oratavisms, many of them bestial and some possibly super-human. [For those Setianswho find the idea ofreincarnation unacceptable, consider Kenneth Grant’s proposition that memoriesof past stages in the evolutionarycycle could be imprinted in the D.N.A. code.]Kia was the primal force behind the Universe [like the Black Magical concept ofthe “ordering” force]: a dynamic- as opposed to static - energy ... like electricity except incalculably moresubtle and powerful. Later in his life heconsidered Kia to be primarily sexual in nature. In this he resembled Reich withhis “bion” and “orgone” energy. Heused several forms of sex-magic to arouse concentrated Kia - the medium of hismagic. The Setian will recognize theparallel of this idea with that of the Tantric “Kundalini”.Much later in his life, during his “Zos Kia Cultus” period, Spare, by somemetaphysical juggling, identified Kiawith the energy that is synonymous with the autonomous self ( Zos).His most important magical contribution is his concept of “Sigilization”. Itsprocess is basically as follows: Hewould define his desire in a clear, direct written form, i.e. “This is my wish[he always included this prologue;possibly it was an unwillingness to disregard all magical tradition; that is,the preliminary “invocation” or“statement of dedication”]: to obtain the strength of tigers.” He would thensigilize each phrase using the individualletters (and not repeating them). Then he would combine the sigils and simplifythem again.The use of the final sigil consisted of impressing its image on the subconsciousmind and then purposely“forgetting” it - the idea being that the subconscious was the source of allmagical power ( Kia) and that thesubconscious would recognize the hidden meaning of the glyph (which theconscious mind had “forgotten”) andfulfill the desire. The crux of the operation, of course, was the consciousdismissal of the significance of the symbol.To impress the sigil on the deeper mind, Spare used techniques of intenseconcentration, visualizing just the imageof the sigil, and several forms of sex-magic [when the ego is “destroyed”].Another magical practice was the design of practical stelæ. Here Spare woulddesign a stela which had atraceable path throughout the surface, containing, between twisting linkages ofline, god-forms [of many cultures,including some of unknown origin], atavistic forms, personal sigils, andesoteric glyphs, all in a continuous line - hispencil never left the surface - and ending [or beginning: his stelæ and literaryworks relied on the nonlinear conceptof Time] like two ends of unknotted string or concluding in some sigil, actingas a “doorway”.These stelæ and his paintings were magical operations intended to effect“atavistic resurgence”. Spareaccomplished much of his magic through the help of “familiars” which heconceived as being forces within the- 262 -psyche that were memories of bestial and other incarnations. These atavisms weresuperior to his conscious egoand, for a specific purpose and time, possessed him.His stelæ and drawings show considerable Egyptian influence. In one particularwork, the “Forces of the Sigils”,the image of Set is clearly defined. Spare’s experiments with “atavisticresurgence” probably inclined him to believethat he had discovered the true significance behind bestial-attributed Egyptiangods. It is interesting to note that theancient Greeks, who had no definite magical tradition [except one, but more ofthat in a later article!] consideredtheir gods in completely anthropomorphic forms.Utilizing his stelæ and a sensory deprival technique he called the “DeathPosture” Spare often retired into hissub-conscious mind where he claimed he saw “sidereal perspectives” and strangegeometries and landscapes. Hedespaired that he could never faithfully reproduce these visions, however, thealert observer can see these strangeshapes (trapezoids, pyramids and unusual quadrilaterals and planes) lurkingbehind the main forms in any givenwork of his.He incorporated his intensely individual system into the “witch-cult”, and Imean “Wicca” as created by GeraldGardner. In its time, as one can readily imagine, Gardner’s revealing of the“witch-cult” caused quite a romanticflutter of the heart to those occult dilettantes who had always dreamt ofbecoming involved with some ancient andpowerful magic cultus. Everybody was in on the act, not the least being Crowley,who wrote all the “original” Wiccanrituals for an appreciable fee. Spare was also influenced by this innovation,and up until the end of his life heapparently had some influence in Wiccan circles.Kenneth Grant, perhaps Spare’s closest friend, describes his involvement withboth Grant’s “New Isis Lodge”and Gardner’s “Coven” as an outside specialist. Both Gardner and Grant relied onhis advice and the efficacy of histalismans/sigils.Through his involvement with the English witch-cult, Spare developed his “ZosKia Cultus”. He elucidated hisconcept of the witch-cult in his unpublished manuscript “The Zoetic Grimoire ofZos” (1950-1956). His concept ofthe “primal woman” receives much emphasis. However I believe that the BlackMagician of the Temple of Set shouldnot overlook his ideas because they evoke the repugnant memory of thepresent-day Neopagans. Rather considerthat the Hindu Tantrics conceived of Kundalith as being feminine (mysterious?)in nature, although they consideredthe energy as being created from two opposing forces, positive and negative,male and female: Ida and Pingala.In his strange cult Spare advanced the discovery and practice of a “primevalsexualism” (something to do withKia) and the realization of ancient desires (atavisms) which would eventuallyproduce a “whole” self.I have written this introduction into the methods and influence of Spare becauseI believe his system is worthfurther investigation by the Setian. His sigilization technique has workedextremely well for me, and I also believethat the alert Setian will discover some “Setian” implications within hisphilosophy.For Further ReadingKenneth Grant, The Magical Revival and, to a lesser extent, Aleister Crowley andthe Hidden God.Nevill Drury and Stephen Skinner, The Search for Abraxas.Man, Myth and Magic, Volumes #2 and #3 under “Atavisms” and “Austin Osman Spare”respectively.The Book of Pleasure was republished in 1974 C.E. by Gilded Quill Bookshoppe, 39Patio de Leon, Ft.Myers, Florida.- 263 -A19: How Bubastis Pylon Got its Name- by Margaret Wendall IV°Scroll of Set #I-12, August 1976[reprinted from The Magic Cat #IV-4, June 1976, Bubastis Pylon]The city of Bubastis (the Greek word for Pa-Bast) was an important city inancient Egypt. Not only was it the siteof worship of one of the Egyptians’ favorite goddesses, it was the capital ofNome XVIll (Am-Khent)124 on theEastern Nile Delta, near the modern Tell Basta and the city of Zazagig. Somewriters have indicated that the first“Suez Canal” ran from Bubastis to the Red Sea.The city’s chief goddess was, of course, the cat Bast, but other gods andgoddesses were also honored: Wadjet,Harakhti, and Atum (the gods of Heliopolis); Atum-Ra’s son, Shu; and from thetime of Rameses III, Set and Ptah.Bast is often confused with Sekhmet; in fact, because both are feline, someauthors will tell you they are the samegoddess, although to Egyptians they represented separate concepts. For example,Sekhmet was the patroness ofphysicians, while Bast was the special goddess of women, and in many respectsher worship parallels Catholicworship of Mary. Yet Bast is an evolutionary descendant of Sekhmet, much thesame as our domestic cat may be adescendant of the lion.We meet Sekhmet long before we find Bast in a land where the Sun can kill aswell as give life, and where theSun is both revered and respected. Ptah, the creator-god of Memphis, wasrepresented both as a bull and the Sun.Sekhmet was Ptah’s consort and represented the Sun’s violent and destructiveheat.When the seat of power moved from Memphis to Thebes, Sekhmet followed. The Sunbecomes Amon-Ra.Sekhmet waited each day to kill Apep, the great serpent who threatened todestroy Amon-Ra at sunset, the end ofhis daily journey across the sky. As the “Eye of Ra”, Sekhmet spotted Apep,killed him, and saved the Sun, withoutwhom all life would cease. The transition from Sekhmet to Bast had begun.The original Bast was possibly a “caffre cat”, which is similar to today’sAbyssinian, except that instead of havingticked fur it was more tabby. Caffre cats apparently abounded in northern Egyptare are presumed by some to be theancestors of all our domesticated cats.The caffre cats lived in the Nile delta and helped to rid the area of snakes andvermin. All cats are independentby nature, but because rats and mice are more plentiful near human habitationwhere grain is stored than in thedesert, cats quite literally moved in with the Egyptians. There was almost asymbiotic relationship between man andcat; neither could have lived quite as well without the other. The cats movedinto the cool temples, and it wasn’t longbefore temples were built in their honor.In Bubastis the “Eye of Ra” and slayer of Apep became the popular snake-killing,caffre cat goddess Bast. Intime this purring domestic cat almost relegated the lioness to oblivion innorthern Egypt, but such are the ways ofcats.Whereas Sekhmet had represented the heat of the desert Sun and vengeancelong before she became thepatroness of healing, Bast always represented life and the gentle heat of theSun. She is called the “Lady of Life”, andone invocation to her asks that she grant “life, power, health, and joy ofheart”.Egyptian women wore Bast amulets with kittens to represent the number ofchildren they wanted. Everydomestic cat was considered to be the same cat, Bast, and it was a capitaloffense to kill one. It apparently wasn’t acrime to let the cats kill each other, though.When a cat died, its family went into great mourning, even shaving theireyebrows. The cat’s body was eithermummified and buried in special cat cemeteries, or cremated with great pomp. Catmummies are so numeroustoday that a museum with an exhibit on Egypt should have at least one.Several goddesses have been likened to Bast: Rat, the female counterpart of Tem;Mut, the Lady of Asheru; lusa-aset at Heliopolis; Hathor; Isis; Sekhmet and Menhet in Nubia; and Mut andUatchet at Memphis. Whereas thesegoddesses do share Bast’s attributes, Bast is the only goddess to whom thedomestic cat was sacred.Sekhmet is represented as a lioness crowned by the solar disk and the uræus. Shesometimes holds an ankh anda sceptre. Bast is represented in many ways, but always with the head of adomestic cat. Sometimes she is seated,her tail wrapped around her front paws. Sometimes she is a mother cat surroundedby kittens. Sometimes she ispictured wearing one earring. In human-cat form Bast is often standing, holdinga sistrum (a musical instrumentwith a sound similar to a cat’s purr) in her right hand, a basket over her leftarm and an ægis in her left hand.Bast is also represented with the disk and uræus of Sekhmet, but Bast is seldoma lioness and Sekhmet is nevera domestic cat. All of this might make Bast sound pretty “white light” were itnot for the nature of cats, and acoincidence: Bast has also been associated with Taurt, sometimes represented asSet’s wife; and in the sky Bast wasrepresented by Gamma Draconis - Set’s star. The circumpolar stars and thoseclose to them were reserved for “godsof darkness~ in Egypt from the time when night was darkness save for the lightfrom the heavens. In this one124 Of Lower Egypt. Some authors call this the Vll Nome. The number of Nomesincreased as Egypt progressed from the Old toMiddle to New Kingdoms.- 264 -respect Bast always retained the character of Sekhmet; and even the most gentleand purring domestic cat is capableof all the ferocity of a lioness.Herodotus tells us that the annual festival at Bubastis was celebrated duringthe second month of inundation(Paini, 5/26-6/25125 ), which would immediately precede the North Solsticebeginning the astronomical period ofSet. Herodotus was also struck by the fact that the Temple of Bast was visiblefrom every point in the city ofBubastis. It stood in a hollow and was surrounded by the city, which wasamphitheater-shaped due to the variousbuildings which had been razed for new construction. Since many pharaohs andother wealthy individualscommissioned buildings in Bubastis, the “hills” must have been quite high. Eventhough Bubastis was an importantcity, this razing and rebuilding has apparently made Bubastis an archeologicalsite far more important than the cityitself was.As far as we know, it was in Egypt that people first adopted small cats ashousehold pets, although cats of manykinds figure in almost all of the religions of the world. It also seems likelythat Bubastis is the only city dedicated tothe worship of the domestic cat. It’s from the city and its caffre cat goddessthat Bubastis Pylon takes its name, inhonor of the domestic animal whose independence, inquisitiveness, beauty,mystery, and depth of personality makeit most “Setian.”ReferencesBudge, E.A.

Sinnott III°Scroll of Set #II-1, September 1976The human race has the potential to destroy itself and all traces of itscivilization within a matter of minutes.Movies that have come out recently seem to show a preoccupation with destructionand doom. For rational, sanepeople, this cataclysm is a frightening aspect, to be avoided by any waypossible.The Temple of Set is dedicated to the survival of civilization and of itsmembership. We are an elitistorganization; we realize that not all people are truly equal, but are indeedunique. Some people are talented andgifted, visionary and intelligent, while others, most, I’m afraid, are nevermeant to see beyond their own noses. We,the elite, must endeavor to lead the masses on a path that will save them, ifpossible. Our first duty, however, is toensure our own survival and prosperity.It would be realistic to point out that our members are few; it is our qualitythat sets [sorry about that pun] usapart from the rest of the religions. Even with our higher quality of people, itis ludicrous to think that we can savethe world. Right now we might be lucky to save ourselves.We cannot, however, allow ourselves to be dominated by pessimism. We live in apolitical climate that allows usto exist, for which we can be grateful. The Temple of Set supports thispolitical system that allows each person toprofess his or her own religious beliefs; without compulsion to change. In fact,on this point, we must alwaysjealously guard this precious right, because it is a right that zealousself-appointed saviours and prophets do notrecognize. Since every person has the right to blind himself by his ownillusions, we do not begrudge anyone’sreligious beliefs. We surely wouldn’t want everyone to become Setians and thusbring unqualified persons into ourTemple. Set chooses his Elect, not the other way around.What of the other political issues, you may ask. There are many controversiesfloating around, and manycandidates seeking your support. Well, the Temple of Set is a recognizedreligious organization and thus tax-exemptunder the laws of the United States and California. This is a valuable thing tohave for all of us, and accuratelyreflects the nature of our organization.The Temple of Set does not involve itself in partisan political activities; itwill not lobby, endorse candidates orissue political position papers. We do so for two reasons: (1) Our tax-exemptstatus forbids it; and (2) Moreimportantly, it could possibly divide our membership over a relatively trivialmatter and thus change the nature ofthe Temple from that of a religious and philosophical society to that of apolitical club.Partisan politics is concerned with immediate, hot issues. It is extremely rarefor this issue to be of any long-range importance. Those in the public forum use these issues to manipulate themasses (i.e. abortion). At times suchan issue may affect the life of individual members, in which case, that membershould be intelligent enough to figureout a lawful course of action to take on his or her own to get the point acrossand protect the interest threatened.Remember that this takes energy. Determine if the interest affected is worth allthis energy to protect it. It ispossible to win the battle (protect the interest) and lose the war (too muchexpended energy and time). You do not(or should not) need the Temple of Set to tell you what to do. We will not belike the Catholic bishop and stand up ina pulpit and tell you to write letters against abortion or anything else. Ourmembers are people, not sheep.As it was stated in the Book of Coming Forth by Night, we are in a crisissituation. If we fail, the Majesty of Setwill be no more. However, if we do succeed, then we shall come into a mostglorious age with purpose andknowledge. That, indeed, is our challenge: to succeed.Success will come by looking into the future and anticipating the adversities,not by grappling blindly in the pitof despair with the present.The problems of the present seem so all-encompassing, yet they are only awarning of the future. For too longwe have lived without considering the ramifications of our actions on futuregenerations.So long as the human race lives on, we have the only form of immortality that isreally possible; the memory ofour deeds and existence in the minds of those who follow us. If we act withoutconsidering those who will follow us,then indeed Set will be no more, as he has tied his fate to that of mankind.We mustn’t wait for others to act and think for us; we must do it ourselves. TheSetian should take it uponhimself to do his part to solve the problems that threaten us, so that mankindcan go on.You need not think in terms of universal salvation. If it is possible to saveonly a few by acting, better that thandoom for everyone. It can be possible to try to save more of the world, but abird in hand is worth two in the bush.We are at a pivotal time in the history of mankind. It’s a bad cliche, but anappropriate one. We can eitherdescend into chaos, destruction, and oblivion, or else find our way to an age ofgreatness where progress cancontinue to give all of us a better life. The Setian is well suited for thisquest.When considering priorities set by the political system, as individuals askthese questions: “Will this help makethe future better? Will it help reach a long-range solution to the problems thatbeset us?” If it does, it should besupported while we also work on our own solutions. If it does not, then youshould either work to change it withinthe law, or redouble your efforts to reach another solution, to ensure our ownsurvival.- 266 -A21: The Right to Die- by James Lewis I°Scroll of Set #II-1, September 1976Death. For many people this is the most frightening word in the world; yet itcan be the most comforting boonavailable to mankind, our Fifth Race included.Bear in mind that I write this as a Setian and also as a member of a nursingteam; you will see both elementsemerge as I comment.Part of my graduation vow, our class promise, was to sustain life insofar as wewere able to do so. Then I recitedthe words with everyone else and had no more idea of what “life” was and is thanI could plot an accurate map ofPluto. All we knew was that we had drugs and machines for everything and everycondition. Ha! Looking back, Irealize that while now my knowledge is limited, then I had the “new graduatesyndrome” and knew everything!The first few patients we lost made me chew my nails long into the nightwondering what else could have beendone. I looked with disgust at doctors who ordered, “NO C.P.R.” (cardiopulmonaryresuscitation) on certainpatients. I thought patients and families who gracefully accepted a coming endto be slightly, if not totally mad. NowI look back and see that these were patients in their seventies, eighties, andnineties; patients with carcinomas, orchronic pulmonary or renal or what-not disorders, and wondered how I could’vebeen cruel enough to want them toremain in such a living hell. Thus saith the nurse.Very few of us have not seen a family member or a close friend in a terminalstage. Some go with grace, dignityand acceptance. Others go with pain, fear, and raging against this end that mustbe. With acceptance or denial, theheart still ends with asystole after the fibrillation stage. Yes, we can doendotracheal intubation, gastric intubations,venous cutdowns, defibrillate in hopes of a normal sinus cardiac pattern,administer intravenous norepinephrine,use respirators, furosenimide - the works! But if the brain cells are damaged sothat there appears to be no hope ofrecovery [and I realize I get into something touchy here], why not stop? Can weof the Fifth Race, or any other,believe the Intellect, the Will, is still there? Suppose it is? Suppose it’schained to this multi-tubed, mechanically-assisted body. Would it not scream for release?Christianity preaches a burning Hell for non-believers. I say that there is nogreater Hell than listening to thesounds of respirators through a tracheostomy, or knowing the last fever I’mfighting with antipyretics and spongingis the body saying, “This is my way of fighting it; let me do it, and then letme go.”Listen now to a remark made by an elderly carcinoma patient who was resuscitatedby some eager-beaver newgraduates after a cardiac arrest: “Why did you bring me back? I was in abeautiful place. I was happy that I wasn’thurting anymore, and those fields and hills went on for as far as I could see. Iwas there, but I knew what you wereall doing to me. You made me come back to this! Why?”I confess it sounds sugary, but the lady has a point. That happened two weeksago and the narcotics needed todecrease her pain grows daily. Senseless, purely and simply senseless.Of course, I’m not advocating never raising a finger, nor do I advocateeuthanasia. I can look back on many whohave been pulled through and lead full lives and on whom all these measures werefully justified.Now I say as a Setian: Let the body return to decay and dust. The Will stilllives. Xeper.- 267 -A22: Why I Collect Science Fiction- by Forrest J Ackerman, Honorary SetianScroll of Set #II-1, September 1976You ask me why I collect science fiction, what I get out of it.First of all, I got my whole life out of it. It brought me, after 47 years ofcollecting, to a $250,000 mortgage thatwill take me til 1998 when I am 84 years old to pay off, just to house theresults of my collecting in a 4-story 17-roomhouse in Hollywood that will be a proper repository for the collection.Al Jolson had to sing. Fred Astaire was born to dance. I discovered sciencefiction when it was still scientifiction,in the October 1926 Amazing Stories, and by 1929 my collection encompassed notonly Amazing but AmazingStories Annual, Amazing Stories Quarterly, Science Wonder Stories, ScienceWonder Quarterly, Air WonderStories, Science & Invention, some Weird Tales, and any issues of Argosy,Bluebook, Liberty, Popular or any other mundane magazines that turned up with“stf” stories in them, plus books by Burroughs, Kline, Cummings et al. Bythen I was corresponding with about 117 fans & authors. Soon I was intocollecting stills from “scientifilms” andtrying my hand at writing sf of my own, and at the beginning of 1932 the firstfanzine was started and I wasassociated with it as a contributor.In the beginning I collected sf avidly because I was thirsty for more thanexisted and it was like a man collectingdew in a desert oasis when he didn’t know where his next drop of water wascoming from.In 1975 I am still collecting science fiction because it has long been a way oflife. Years ago I conceived of thecreation of a Fantasy Foundation. I thought that many people would help me. Fewhave. To those who have, I amimmensely grateful. But many moons ago it became evident that I was mainly goingto have to do it myself.I wonder how much I’ve spent in collecting in nearly 50 years? Several hundredthousand dollars? I wouldn’t besurprised - it seems to me I’ve spent money on very little else. And it’smeaningless to tell me it s been a valuableinvestment; that those 100,000 stills and the other 100,000 books, magazines,paintings, posters, props,manuscripts, etc. are worth over $1 million in today’s inflated market forout-of-print rarities & collectors’ items. Imay be a millionaire, but only theoretically, because I’m never going to cash inmy chips, auction off my holdings, orsell them to libraries & institutions, tempting as it would be to retire. Don’tdelude yourself that I wouldn’t love it,that I wouldn’t be happy to be free of the treadmill of 37 professionaldeadlines a year and all that agentorial work.But I have a voracious white dinosaur to feed: the Ackermansion, the Museum ofImaginative Literature. Have Icollected it, or has it collected me?Well, when I go, it will be with the sense of satisfaction that I have left theworld its greatest collection of sciencefiction & fantasy. And who knows? when the old curator kicks the bucket. it mayonly be for a temporarily-enforced“vacation”, because I intend to opt for a very scientifictional type ofcomeback: cryonic preservation and, potentially,resuscitation. If, after I die, I am later on revived, look at all the sci-fiI’ll have to collect! I can see it now: the NewRave science fiction of the 21st Century!(Not) The End- 268 -A23: Religious Racism- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #II-4, December 1976When I first began this project, my sole intention was to illustrate the mannerin which the dominant Judæo-Christian religion is being used by at least one religious foundation toinculcate and perpetuate racist attitudes andactivities, specifically by an organization called “Your Heritage”.After examining their literature and its religious, political, and economicimplications, however, I wasincreasingly struck by its similarity to the core principles of German NationalSocialism or Nazism, and I feel thatthis ideological identity should be noted in view of its possible implicationsfor the future.“Your Heritage” advocates a specific type of racist attitude: White “Aryan”supremacy. This “Master Race”ideology is founded upon two things: the Judæo-Christian Bible and a number ofworks purporting to presentscientific evidence of White superiority. It is not merely anti-Black andanti-Yellow, but anti-Semitic as well - whichsounds strange indeed until one sees how they justify it. Then it seems evenstranger.In the first place, they claim that all civilizations derive from the Whiterace, and that of the Whites, the Aryan(commonly known today as the Germanic, Scandinavian, and Celtic peoples) aresuperior. This is based primarilyon the writings of de Gobineau, Lapouge, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, whichstate in effect that the Whiterace is superior because White civilizations have reached a higher level thanthose of other races: a sort of socialDarwinism. This is stated clearly in a pamphlet entitled God’s Great Race:The Caucasian or White race is the superior race. It is responsible for thecivilization we have today. Throughoutrecorded history it has produced all the civilizations which have reached a highlevel. The Yellow race has notattained as high a civilization or progressed as far as have the nationscomposed of the Caucasian race. Malaysiansand Polynesians are even less developed, and the Negroes have made the leastprogress of all. Where groups ofCaucasians have merged or interbred with inferior stocks, the Whites havedeteriorated ... The Caucasian race isindeed the greatest of all peoples, and if it dies, the glory of the world willperish with it.So not only are the Whites superior, they must not mix their blood with inferiorraces. Biblically this issupposed to be justified by some of the following passages:“Thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to by thineinheritance.” (I Kings8:53)“For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for a peculiartreasure.” (Psalms 135:4)“For thou art a holy people, the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiarpeople unto himselfabove all the nations that are upon the earth.” (Deuteronomy 7:6)Now this seems rather flimsy, since it obviously refers to Israel; and it hardlyseems to justify anti-Semitism. Butonce you understand that it is actually the modern Aryan nations - and not theJews - who are actually Israel, it allbecomes perfectly clear ... doesn’t it?Why are the Scandinavians, Germans, Franks, British/Scotch/Irish, Canadians,Americans, South Africans (theWhite inhabitants) racially Israelites? Well, you see, the original Israeliteswere White Aryans; and around 700 BCEten of the twelve tribes of Israel were transported into Assyria after a majordefeat. Nothing more is known of themas Israelite tribes after that. But also in the 7th Century BCE appeared in thatarea a people whom the Persianscalled the Sacæ, Scyths, or Scythians, who were a White, light-haired peopledescribed as similar in appearance tothe Celts and Germans. They were nomadic warriors who spread through variousparts of Europe and, by tracingvague similarities in the sounds of names of different tribes, they are “shown”to be the ancestors of the Saxons,Goths, and others.Also cited is the Scythians’ use of the battle-axe as a weapon; it was also afavored weapon of the Saxons, and isthus seen as a carryover from their history as Israel because, in Jeremiah51:20, God says of Israel, “Thou art mybattle-axe and weapons of war, for with thee will I break in pieces the nations,and with thee will I destroykingdoms.”There are also other similarities between the Aryans and the ancient Israelites.For example, the love of liberty isan Anglo-Saxon trait which was also common to the Israelites, which is perhapsnatural since the Israelites seemalways to have been in process of being carried captive into one ancient nationafter another: Babylon, Egypt,Assyria ...What about the Jews, then, who seem to be laboring under the delusion that theyare Israelites? Simple. Thoseknown today as Jews are the descendants of a mongrel breed of Canaanites,Assyrians, Babylonians, and others,who in turn - are you ready for this? - are descended from Cain, who was theoffspring of Satan through hisseduction of Eve in the Garden of Eden. The Jewish race is therefore Satanic andinherently evil.Thus is presented a genetic basis for discrimination against, or even genocideof the Jews. Further it can beBiblically demonstrated by the results of prophecy that the Jews are not the“chosen people” of Israel. Some of theBiblical identification marks by which Israel can be known, quoted from an essay(author unknown) called “Let’sReview the Diagnosis”, are the following:- 269 -Israel -“Would be above all other nations” - Gen. 27:29, Deut. 7:6 & 15:6.“Would be a maritime power” - Gen. 49:25, Num. 24:7, Deut. 33:13 & 19; Psalms89:25.“A great nation and a company of nations” - Gen. 35:11, 48:19.“A people glorifying in Christ” -(From this point on I will simply “hit the high spots” without citing thescriptural verses, as it is obvious thatthere are plenty of them.)A missionary people; custodian of God’s word; possessing the gates of herenemies; havingmultitudinous seed; would colonize and spread abroad; possess mineral andagricultural wealth; wouldinclude a throne perpetually occupied by a king or queen of the Davidic line (anelaborate family treesupposedly tracing descent from David through mythical and historic kings ofIreland, Scotland, and Britainis provided); having a new home in “the appointed place”; to be God’s heritage;to be a people established inrighteousness; to possess God’s holy spirit as well as His Word; to remain inpartial ignorance of specialrelationship with God until the Great Revealing comes; to have a new language...And on, ad nauseam. The claim is made that only the Anglo-Saxon, Celtic,Teutonic, and related peoples bearall these marks, and the Jews have none of them.Now the picture becomes really grim where the Jews are concerned; for they, theliteral children of the Devil,are engaged in a worldwide conspiracy to thwart God’s plan, wipe outChristianity, and exterminate the White Aryanrace. It is because of this Satanic race that we entered World War II: theycontrolled the Presidency at that time:The Jews were getting us into the war, and Roosevelt had given his pledge tothem that we would enterit. The only reason the Jews hated Hitler was because he saw what the Jeweconomic system and bankingsystem had done to Germany, and he was breaking their power ... So, as a meansof strangling Germany anddestroying her economically, the Jews started a world-wide boycott of Germanexports. And you know howthe Jews control commerce in all the nations of the world. It was a declarationof war, as SamuelUntermeyer himself said ... Hitler was starting to put into operation some ofthe laws of God ... Against allthe efforts of the Devil’s children to strangle and destroy her, Germany wasbecoming prosperous by goingback to the economic laws of God - and that had to be destroyed ... (“Babylon’sMoney”)Some of the praise of Hitler is even more emphatic.The Jews also control or engineer economic depressions, etc., and we have becomeconfused and corrupted byaliens. We must turn from the evil ways into which we have fallen before it istoo late.What can we do? Recognize our identity as God’s chosen race and follow his laws.And certain benefits can beexpected if we do so, according to Exodus 19:5-6:“Now, therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then yeshall be a peculiartreasure to me above all people; for all the earth is mine. And ye shall be untome a kingdom of priests, andan holy nation.”And, in Deuteronomy 7:6:“For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosenthee to be a specialpeople unto himself, above all people which are upon the face of the earth.”Nor, according to this essay [called “A Kingdom of Priests”], are we merely tokeep our sacred blood separatefrom that of other races:... What the ... priests were to the Nation of Israel, that nation was to becometo all the world. That is tosay, we were to teach God’s laws and commandments to all the world, to judgethem when they becamedisobedient, to administer and enforce God’s will in all the world. We have notfulfilled our duty in merelysending missionaries to plead with the pagans to adopt God’s laws and religion... When we promised toobey God’s commandments and to assume the powers and duties of his kingdom ofpriests, we reallypromised to administer his world for him, as his priests, not as the servants ofthe African-Asian bloc ofnations in their destruction of civilization ... We should have put his lawsinto effect throughout the world,even if his enemies opposed us ... God himself commanded us to create empires... We will meet oppositionof course; but God commanded us not to retreat before it, but to destroy it.Almost enough to make you shout “Sieg Heil!” when you realize that such a nobledestiny awaits you, isn’t it?These people also await a Messianic prophet (like Hitler?) who will lead them incleansing our lands of corruption,apostasy, and minority groups, for the Old Testament closes with the promise,“Behold, I will send you Elijah the- 270 -prophet before the coming of the great and terrible Day of the Lord.” So here wehave imperialism just waiting toblossom again.There is much, much more that I could have mentioned, but this is enough toprovide a general overview of theorganization’s propaganda. Having seen what they are preaching, let us see justhow solid a foundation they reallyhave, and whether or not they might actually be able to achieve their goals.First, the Nazis held the same sort of “Master Race” theory; and the ideology of“Your Heritage” is based on thesame source material: de Gobineau, etc., authored their “scientific” material.The term “Aryan” actually arose from the discovery that most European languagesbelonged to the same familyas those of Iran, Afghanistan, and the greater part of India. The originallanguage seems to have developed in theUkraine or Poland prior to 2000 BCE; its speakers had tamed the horse andinvented chariots, which enabled themto conquer adjacent peoples, make themselves a ruling class, impose theirlanguage on their subjects, andintermarry with them. Their descendants conquered other tribes and so on untiltheir language - now broken intomany tongues retaining similarities of words and grammar - was spread fromPortugal to Ceylon. The conquerors ofIran and India around 1500 B.C.E. called themselves Arya, meaning “nobles”; andwhen scholars realized thekinship of derivative languages as far apart as Icelandic, Armenian, andBengali, they called this linguistic family“Aryan.”The Aryan peoples, also called Indo-Europeans, overthrew a number ofcivilizations but created none; and as faras science can presently tell, there is not and probably never has been an“Aryan race” since, whatever the originalAryans’ racial type (which is still unknown), it soon disappeared as a result ofintermarriage with the morenumerous subjugated peoples. The term “Aryan,” if used properly, refers only toa family of related languages. Therehas probably never been a truly “pureblooded” race on Earth.Curiously the source material cited in “Your Heritage”’s literature, with onlythree or four exceptions, waswritten during the period roughly from 1910 CE into the 1940’s - the same periodduring which the Nazi racialtheories were being formed and applied. Many are the same books from which theyderived their ideas. This implies,if not an actual connection with the Nazis, at least that we have here a case ofracism seeking justification asopposed to racism created by religious dogma, particularly since most of thepassages cited refer to Israel.The argument hinges largely on identification of the Scythians with theIsraelites, which is not satisfactorilyaccomplished. The fact that Scythians (exceedingly warlike nomads wearingtrousers and pointed caps) appeared inthe same area to which most of the Israelite nation was transported as captivesin the same century does not arguethat they are the same, but rather that the Scythians exterminated theIsraelites.And there are few shakier things on which to base an argument than Biblicalprophecy, since the sameprophecies are applied to many different events. Take as one example that of theAntichrist, the false Messiah whowill lead the world astray in the last days before the coming again of Christ. Anumber of monarchs and at least onePope - not to mention Hitler - have been proclaimed by theologians to be theAntichrist; even Henry Kissinger wasrecently targeted as such by one religious group.Propaganda, however, need not be truthful to be effective; all that is necessaryis that it have a “ring ofauthenticity” - an appearance of truth. It is not designed to appeal to the loneintellectual, but to the massesthrough their emotions. And the Judæo-Christian religion, founded upon emotionrather than reason (being in facta corrupted copy of the ancient Egyptian cult of Osiris with later historicalaccretions from other religions) andholding sway over millions, is an ideal vehicle through which to influence thenon-thinking herd. The Nazis alsoused religious concepts in their own propaganda, proclaiming that they were the“sons of light” preparing to dobattle with the powers of darkness and the Satanic race of Jewry.But could this sort of nonsense really gain control of enough men’s minds togive rise to another Nazi Germanytype of situation? Well, it happened once before; perhaps, presented in theguise of religion ...And there are factors arising which did not exist in Hitler’s time and which mayexert great influence on thecourse of human events. According to the research of the Club of Rome, theCousteau Society, and othersophisticated and ecological forecasting groups, the human race as a whole willface a major crisis during the next50-100 years due to overpopulation, pollution, and lack of resources. It willprobably, according to the projections ofthe Temple of Set, attain full force in a gradual way involving increasinganarchy and then a major authoritarianbacklash. Such a group might find a ready audience, innumerable scapegoats, anda great deal of popular supportunder increasingly intolerable social conditions, and a dictatorial theocracycould conceivably develop. The trendtoward authoritarian government is steadily increasing as egalitarian/permissive governmental systems like ourown find themselves less capable of dealing with the growing pre-crisisstresses. And look at the fascist regimeswhich have come into being in our own century in Germany, Italy, Japan, SouthAmerica, and Africa.And “Your Heritage” appears to have outside help. While it claims not to be apart of any other organization. Ifind that about half the pamphlets they sent me - the more sophisticated ones,in fact - were printed and publishedby a group called the Federation of the Covenant People in Johannesburg, SouthAfrica.Now South Africa is well known for its Apartheid policy of discriminationagainst the native Africans and itsadvocacy of White racial supremacy. And here is another interesting tidbit:South Africa has recently minted a newgold coin, the Krugerrand, which weighs one ounce and sells on the internationalmarket for whatever the currentprice of gold happens to be (In fact, I saw a recent television advertisementwhich proclaimed, “You’re not justbuying a coin - you’re buying gold!”).- 271 -Now gold mined in different areas is distinctive, because it will bear certaintrace elements in varyingproportions depending on the location whence it comes. Millions of dollars of SSgold disappeared from Germany atthe close of World War II, and, according to Setian Priest Mark Harris, theKrugerrand has created quite a stirbecause it has been found to contain the same identifying characteristics as themissing SS gold. A country like theRepublic of South Africa would seem to be a logical place for a WhiteAryan-supremacist Nazi to move after losing awar ...An eventual “Fourth Reich” might not be quite as farfetched an idea as it seems.SourcesPublications from “Your Heritage”, San Diego, California:- A Kingdom of Priests- Daniel’s Fifth Kingdom- Historic Proof of Israel’s Migrations- Let’s Preview the Diagnosis- Suppose We are Israel, What Difference Does it Make?- Adam was Not the first Man- Your Heritage- God’s Great Race- Your Genetic Inheritance- Babylon’s MoneyDe Camp, L.

New York: VintageBooks/ Random House,1973.- 272 -A24: From The Art of Loving by Erich Fromm- by Linda Parinello [Reynolds] I°Scroll of Set #II-6, February 1977I began reading this book expecting to find some clues in my search for what iscommonly labeled the “idealpersonal relationship”, or at least affirmation that my present relationship isthe ideal one! What I uncovered,however, is quite apart from what I was looking for.While sifting through the author’s theories on love as the answer to theproblems of human existence, I foundmore and more acknowledgment of the fact that we as Setians are truly strivingfor goals much higher than merehuman existence can ever offer!While mankind has essentially [and allegedly] emerged from the animal kingdom,from instinctive“adaptation”, Setians have already far surpassed that achievement. Mankind hasbeen gifted with reason. Anawareness of himself, his past, his possibilities for the future. But instead oftaking the ultimate advantage of thisawareness of himself as a separate entity, he instead fears it - fears hisseparateness and imagined helplessnessbefore the laws of nature and society.Fromm says, “The deepest need, then, is the need to overcome his separateness.”Is this true for the Setian? Idon’t think so! Man has lived through many ages and cultures faced with the samequestion - how to overcomeisolation and separateness - how to conform to achieve acceptance and onenesswith his fellow man and themindless universe.If I am like everybody else ... if I conform in custom, dress, ideas, to thepattern of the group, I am saved; savedfrom the frightening experience of aloneness.Somehow, I feel you’ll agree with me that the terror lies in that shepherdconformity and not in any individualbehavior! The tragic thing is, most people don’t even recognize thisoverpowering instinct to conform. They gothrough life pitifully believing that their ideas and beliefs are their own.[Fortunately they just happen to coincidewith the popular beliefs in vogue at the time!]One example of this for me is what I call the “Haight-Ashbury Syndrome”. Thesepoor, misinformed “flowerchildren - these pseudo-intellectuals - dropped out a while back and stated thatthey had achieved individuality! Nolonger would they conform to the dictates of our society and government. Theyclaimed to achieve, by the use ofdrugs [and filthy surroundings] an expanded consciousness, an awakened state -true liberation! Women’s Lib,Cosmic Awareness, Holistic Approach, est, karma ... all terms and methods these“individuals” used to show theirpathetic need for difference. The reality is however, that there is noindividuality left at all. As Fromm states,“Equality today means ‘sameness’ rather than ‘oneness’.” These tragic peoplewill call you “up tight” if you don’tcarry around your issue of Rolling Stone, smoke grass, dress and live like aslob, or attend courses and seminars on“liberation” staffed by smiling, non-thinking automatons.Setians, rejoice! The Gift given you is more valuable than life itself, for itis life - on a much greater level thanmankind as a whole can ever hope to achieve. Gone is the fear of separatenessand aloneness, for in your magicalworkings, who else but yourself as an individual can break through thedimensional barriers and communicate withthe very same entity who saved you from the hideous death of mindlessconformity!This gift has been called an “experiment” ... but I will go further and call it“an experiment of love”. As Frommstates, “Love is an active power in man; a power which breaks through the wallswhich separate man from his fellowman, which unites him with others, makes him overcome the sense of isolation andseparateness; yet it permits himto be himself, to retain his integrity. In love, the paradox occurs that twobeings become one and yet remain two.”Sound familiar? I feel that I can reword that entire quote, applying it directlyto our ritual experiences - our“Set-experiences” - and who could deny it? Haven’t we broken down the wallswhich separate our essence from theessence of Set? Haven’t we felt the separateness and isolation give way to anoverwhelming sense of fulfillment andsharing in ritual - each of us as an individual, retaining our own distinctpower of will, and yet, in joining with theEssence from beyond the Pentagram, that paradox once again occurs: “Two beingsbecome one and yet remain two.”We must remember, also, that this could never occur were it not for the factthat you as a Setian can exercise aquality which has almost disappeared from the surrounding mundane society - thatof inner freedom andindependence. Without this individuality and your awareness and use of it bymeans of your ever-increasing powerof will, this “miracle”, this dimensional breakthrough, could never take place.Reading further, I found more and more supportive evidence to my “experiment oflove” idea. Fromm states,“Love is an activity, not a passive affect; the active character of love (itsfirst aspect) can be described by stating thatlove is primarily giving.” Not, of course, in the exploitive or sacrificialsense, but rather as an outward expression ofone’s own potency. In your act of giving, you will experience strength andpower. In giving of his essence, Set alsoexercises and experiences his power, compounding and complementing it in us. Hegives us what is alive in him andthereby enhances and enriches his own aliveness - an endless cycle and one forwhich we can be eternally grateful. Itindicates a faith in his own powers, courage to rely on them to help us toachieve his goal for us that of evolution, ofSetamorphosis - and finally, joy in the knowledge that through the giving of hisessence, there is never a depletionbut always a growth and enhancement through our growth!- 273 -The second aspect of love - responsibility - also is indicated quite clearly inour relationship with our benevolentfriend. A self-imposed responsibility to us, which could have easily degeneratedinto domination [read again theDiabolicon] has always remained a constant benefit to us because of the thirdaspect of love stated by Fromm: thatof respect - the knowledge of our uniqueness, our individuality, and the abilityto allow it to remain that way withoutinterference. Set will go so far as to inform us of our powers and the secretsto their use, but we are loved; we mustgrow and achieve and evolve on our own. Without exploitation, with guidance, andwithout interference. Ourindividual evolution, though it is an enhancement to the Powers of Darkness, wasnever meant to be subservient tothose Powers.“Speak rather to me as to a friend. Do not bend your knee nor drop your eye ...”Xeper.- 274 -A25: Things That Go Hump In The Night- by Lilith Sinclair IV°Scroll of Set #II-7, March 1977Incubus: A spirit or dæmon who has carnal relations with mortal women.Succubus: A spirit or dæmon who takes the shape of a woman and tempts or hascarnal relations withmortal men.Incubus. Succubus. Depending on one’s point of view, those two words induceshivers of delight andanticipation, or great terror and repulsion. Traditionally practitioners of theBlack Arts were said to welcome andthoroughly enjoy the sensual attentions of these dæmon lovers, while theirwhite-light counterparts feared themgreatly and strove to resist being seduced and ravished by the licentiouscreatures. Since they almost alwayssuccumbed in the end, however, it is safe to assume that their great show ofresistance was but token in nature andserved to allow them to enjoy the delights of the flesh with a clear conscience,as it were. After all it certainly wasn’ttheir fault if the lustful dæmons were stronger than they and overpowered them!Interestingly, as the sexual climate became less repressed and grew more openand permissive, these “attacks”by rapacious dæmons diminished in frequency until they are now all butnon-existent in today’s swinging,cosmopolitan society. That tells you a good deal about the true nature of oursubjects right there.To the Black Magician, however, the Incubus and Succubus are creatures ofdelight, to be summoned at will. Itis harmless fun as long as the sorcerer or sorceress recognizes them for whatthey are, creations of his or her ownmind, with no existence other than that which we choose to give them. They arenot separate, tangible entities, anddo not become so until we call them into existence by the creative power of ourown wills. When we cease to think ofthem, they cease to exist, until the next time we fashion them throughimagination and desire.For the novice magician this confusion between objective and subjectiveexistence is a common mistake as he orshe moves slowly and sometimes painfully through the learning process. Are thereany of us who do not look backupon our own fledgling years and cringe at the mistakes we made? Remember someof the asinine ideas we had? Weall know this phase, but the point is not to get bogged down there - to passbeyond it with awareness of the pitfallswe avoided, as well as those into which we blundered.The evolution of the will and clarity of perception it brings enable us to seethat things such as dæmon lovers arebrought into being by our own heightened powers. This does not make the physicalsensations any less real orsatisfying. On the contrary, they can become highly intense and quitepleasurable. Kept in perspective, it can be ahealthy, enjoyable experience.The key words here are “kept in perspective”. If this is lost sight of, themagician ends up behaving like astereotyped caricature, going off in all the wrong directions and wastingprecious time & energy. By the time wehave evolved to the level of Setians, all such running-in-circles should be donewith.To be sure, some mistakes will still be made. We are, after all, human - some ofus, that is. Erroneous ideas andmisconceptions will occur. But basic perception and understanding of the truenature and power of the Setian willshould be mastered at this point in our evolution, as well as the application ofthat will to the universe around usand recognition of its resultant effects. Failure to recognize this concept isan indication that more time is needed inthe development and evolution of the magician. There are no short-cuts, noovernight wizards. Until and unless thisis thoroughly understood, attempts to function as such will be largelyineffectual.Now go ahead and summon those nameless and unspeakable playmates, and may a goodtime be had by all!- 275 -A26: The Second Year- by Michael A. Aquino V°High Priest of SetScroll of Set #II-10, June 1977As you can see from the Executive Director’s report, we have devoted much of oursecond year of operation torefining the systems created in the first year, as well as to introducing somenew ones for testing. We haveexperienced some complete successes and some failures - all of which adds up toa year well-spent. [I mistrust“failure-free” situations; it is an unmistakable sign that little or noexperimentation is tolerated, or that unfavorableresults of experiments are being swept under the rug. A crucial part of the“atmosphere” of the Temple of Set mustbe the freedom to err without fear of lingering ostracism after correctivemeasures have been applied.]I think it is about time to explain the “model” of the Temple of Set to you indetail - the conceptual vision of thisinstitution that I have in mind when I make decisions concerning itsdevelopment. Once you understand what it isthat we are heading towards, the intermediate steps - and the growing pains -will seem somewhat less mysterious.Let me begin by answering a question which arises quite frequently indiscussions with new Setians and non-members alike: Just how - if at all - does the Temple really differ from otheroccult, magical, or religious groups?Isn’t it just “the same old story” with slightly different mythologicaltrappings and a higher degree of organizationalefficiency?There are three very important parts to the answer. The first part is that,before developing its philosophy, theTemple has attained a perspective on human history [both philosophical andpractical] that is, in the strictestpossible sense, all-inclusive and detached. We have made a careful study ofhuman ideas and behavior for theexpress purpose of avoiding repetition of patterns, on the principle that thosewho do not understand andappreciate history are condemned to relive it.The detachment involved in this perspective is equally important. Objectivity inany analysis requires acomplete lack of bias on the part of the analyst. [This is why computers areinvaluable as analytical tools ... to theextent that they do not have human bias programmed into them!]The Setian mind differs from the human mind precisely in its ability to detachitself from the vast panorama ofthe “natural” course of events and to assess that panorama from an independentvantage-point. The crystal-clear“vision” that results - and the subsequent operations of the Setian mind uponthat panorama to influence it - are theessence of what the natural, human mind can only understand as “magic” - becausethe principles involved arecompletely beyond the reach of its vision. This principle of complete historicalscope and detached perspective isfound in no other institution on this planet. It is entirely unique to theTemple of Set.The second part of the answer is that the Temple is gradually being configuredto operate in an environmentthat is distinct from that of material, natural events and non-comprehensible tothose whose value systems arelimited to the natural universe. This means that the behavior of the Temple willultimately not be influenced orcontrolled by outside events, but will be based upon a matrix of principles andpriorities determined by the Templeitself.Technically this also means that the Temple will never pose a deliberate threatto human political or socialdevelopments, because it will not be an interested party to them. It will merelytake them into objective accountwhen evaluating the material environment in which it must exist. In “escaping”from the natural course of humanevents, the Temple must never make the mistake of ignoring it. In fact we mustunderstand and appreciate it farmore thoroughly than the humans who exist completely within its confines if weare to neutralize its - and their -influence upon us.As in the relationship between Hari Seldon’s Foundation and the Empire, humansociety cannot claim that theTemple of Set poses a deliberate threat to it. But human nature is such that itfears anything outside of itscomprehension and will actively attempt to destroy it rather than to tolerateit. We would be quite foolish if we didnot appreciate this fact; on the other hand we must not allow that appreciationto give way to paranoia.The Temple must control events in such a way so that it is never perceived orisolated as a target. This is a taskwhich has many ramifications. The first and simplest one is that the Temple mustnot distort its true admissionsprocess - one of recognition rather than of attempted conversion orindoctrination. If we seek numerical growth asa measure of “success”, we will completely violate the principle of the ElectSetian mind as the only criterion formembership.Another aspect of distorted admissions is that humans who are exposed to theinternal workings of the Templewill necessarily perceive them in a different way than we do - at best asnonsensical and at worst as a threat. Whensuch humans are eventually processed out of the Temple, they will be suspiciousand fearful of it. That it is illogicalfor them to hold that opinion will make no difference; they will form thevanguard of any “witch-hunt” that mightdevelop. [Remember that Pythagoras and his school were destroyed by a mob led byand consisting largely ofpersons who had been dismissed from that school as being intellectuallyinadequate.]At all times we must be careful to explain the Temple to curious humans in sucha way that they understand itsnon-interference with their affairs. Only if we fail to do this are we askingfor trouble by permitting a polarization to- 276 -solidify against us. Make no mistake: If such a polarization should transpire,our chances of surviving it arenebulous indeed.This is a good time to explain a few things about the First Foundation of theTemple, that “super-sinister”element that you have heard described as everything from an Orwellian “ThoughtPolice” to a paramilitary varianton the Nazi SS. 1F is neither. Rather it is a task force with the specificmission of forecasting the social environmentin which the Temple will be existing within the near- and medium-range future[up to about 50 years ahead], and ofrecommending timely preparations which the Temple should make to existcomfortably under such circumstances.It is really as simple as that.The rumors get started for the simple reason that some of the alternativefactors which must be evaluated in anobjective forecast imply rather ugly future situations, which would call forcorrespondingly substantialreconfigurations of the Temple. But forecasting is a long way from establishedfact, and is by no means ajustification for over-reaction on our part. It is a research tool, not acrystal ball. [I don’t mind saying that theforecasting technique to be tested by 1F is conceptually the most advanced - andaccurate - in existence.]The third part of the answer is that the Temple of Set is not a “thing initself” to whose benefit the efforts of itsInitiates are directed. Using the analogy of Metropolis, it is not a machinefeeding upon the energy of its tenders.Put more precisely, it is a collection of systems designed to maximize theindividual Setian’s expenditure of energyfor magical ends.Let us examine this point carefully. The vast number of factors and the greatpersonal expertise which amagician must bring to bear upon a given problem make the probability of errorand/or inaccuracy very high.Accordingly a lone practitioner will spend a great deal of time and effort onwild-goose chases, or in repeating theprocesses of elimination that many another magician has laboriously pursuedbefore [or may be pursuingsimultaneously]. Efficient communication of past and present techniques will goa long way towards eliminating thisproblem.The magician’s work may be directed towards uncomprehending recipients, ofcourse, but within the Temple anincreasing percentage of it is undertaken with the object of communicating theresults to minds capable ofappreciating them. Here the Temple membership structure serves a second function- that of identifying such mindsat levels of initiatory awareness recognized by the degree-system. By recourseto this reference structure, a magicianmay direct efforts to where they will achieve the maximum results with theminimum waste.The research-oriented machinery within the Temple is being designed with asimilar economy and simplicity inmind. According to the present concept, it boils down to four distinct yetinterlocking areas: (1) The Scroll, (2) TheRuby Tablet, (3) Data Processing, and (4) Personal Contact.The Scroll of Set is designed to convey information of time-value to the entireTemple at short notice, as well asto to introduce ideas for general consideration which have not been researchedin depth. Purely-administrativearticles and notices are kept to a minimum, so that philosophical & magicalmaterial may be given priority.Contributions from I°-IV° Initiates are all encouraged. [I deliberately avoidsending material other than theseannual reports in order to maximize the space available to others.]The size, composition, weight, and length of the Scroll are all designed tomaximize information. Expensive frillssuch as multicolor printing and heavyweight paper are avoided. Bound volumes ofthe newsletter are available at alow price to new Setians [or to current ones who desire a bound set].A measure of the Scroll is that, in the two years of its existence, the volumeand scientific/intellectual value of itscontents have easily surpassed the precision, scope, and timeliness of all otheroccult/religious/magical literature inexistence.The Ruby Tablet of Set, presently scheduled for initial release this summer,will be a Setian encyclopædiadesigned for reference material of a longer and more complex nature than issuitable for the Scroll. It will serve as arepository for some of the most advanced philosophy of the Temple and, like theScroll, it will not be available tonon-Setians. [In fact, because of the nature of many of its contents, it will beavailable only to those who have beenrecognized as II° or above.] It will be produced in loose-leaf, so thatadditions and modifications to the contents canbe made frequently - even monthly - without necessitating wasteful, tediousoverhauls of the entire encyclopædia.Via a system designed by its Editor, Magister Robert Ethel, the various essaysare extensively footnoted, cross-referenced, and indexed to a master bibliography - which itself will be keyed toa new Temple Reading List about2-3 times the size, detail, and sophistication of the present one. The RubyTablet will gradually expand into a workcovering the entire scope of the Temple and completely surpassing such priorefforts as the Equinox, the GoldenBough, etc. in length, organization, and timeliness of data.[So that the Temple will not become bogged down in storing and distributing avariety of books, the idea is toconsolidate the contents of as many papers as possible in the Ruby Tablet. Forexample, The Book of Coming Forthby Night: Analysis & Commentary will not be reprinted as a single volume; itspages will eventually be reprinted asa section of the Ruby Tablet.]To date our Data Processing element, overseen from Detroit by Magister MichaelGrumboski, has been used inonly a limited fashion - for membership records and cross-referencing ofstatistical and demographic data. In thefuture this element will gradually assume a role of greater and greaterimportance to the Temple. Computers havethe ability to store, process, transmit, and refine immense amounts of data atincredibly high speeds. For anoperation of our projected scope, computer technology will be absolutelyindispensable.- 277 -As the logical criteria for our magical operations, forecasting procedures, andcooperative projects aredetermined in greater and greater detail, it will be to our advantage to keythem into software programs that can beapplied to computer modules at momentary notice for the solution of specificproblems. Coding systems for suchdata may be developed which will enable Setians with personal hand-calculatorsto decipher numerical print-outsinto readable documents. These are not pipe dreams; they are concepts which areon the drawing boards right now.The final component of our research/ communications network is as crucial as theothers: personal contact.Printed material can accomplish a great deal, but it cannot capture the essenceof the Setian mind in the way thatpersonal communication can. Indeed the very process of initiatory recognition ofthe Temple depends completelyupon personal evaluation. Appropriately emphasis will always be placed in thisarea.Conclaves, personal meetings, Pylon activities, newsletters, bulletins, andindividual letters all form a part ofthis process. From Santa Barbara alone more than eight good-sized “telephonebooks” of letters have gone out in thepast two years - twice the output of six years’ correspondence for the oldChurch of Satan. Forty-one bulletins of upto ten single-spaced pages apiece have gone out to the Priesthood, frequentlyaccompanied by voluminousenclosures as well - all to ensure that every Priest and Priestess of Set iscompletely up-to-date on the “nerve center”workings of the Temple. All this is to ensure that when you contact one of theseofficials - any one - he or she willhave immediate access to the same data that I do.There is an extremely important reason for this stress upon personal contact. Asyou know, Setians I° face atime-limit of two years in which they must demonstrate their ability to berecognized as II°. This is not somethingwhich they can achieve by memorizing and parroting Temple documents. [Indeedlittle more than the Scroll is evenmade available to a I°.]Rather this ability will be recognized in a I° by a III° in the course ofnormal, systematic dialogue between them.It is a quality which is not the product of “occult book-learning”, but of anindividual’s presence of mind in thestrictest possible sense.Another effect of this practice is that persons who join the Temple with theidea of gaining access to its archiveswhile remaining mute and unseen themselves will discover that the majority ofTemple texts will be unavailable tothem - and that within two years they will be gently but firmly disengaged fromthe Temple altogether. The time andenergy of the Elect are precious and will not be wasted on parasites. They arereserved for those who are also Elect -who will continue to find their way to us and to Come Into Being as the firstmanifestations of the Third Stage ofhuman evolution.This, then, is a working profile of the Temple of Set - an organization which isat once based on principles olderthan the Pyramids and yet developing concepts far ahead of conventional science.Indeed it is “Alpha and Omega” -possible by Xeper.- 278 -A27: Rituals Without Chambers- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #II-11, July 1977In the writings and teachings of traditional occult philosophy, one encountersconstant references to an “astralbody” and an “astral plane” (or equivalent terms such as “etheric”). The astralis described as a finer, more“spiritualized” state of matter than that with which the profane are familiar,and the most marvelously mutablequalities are ascribed to it.The traveler on the astral plane is free from ordinary spatial restrictions. Hemay walk, in his astral body, rightthrough a wall of his house, since he can perceive and function within adifferent “universe”. However, he will notnecessarily be able to perceive the ordinary, objective universe. Thus, havingpassed through the wall of his home,he may not be aware that it is raining outside. In Magick in Theory and PracticeAleister Crowley observed that:This astral plane is so varied and so changeable that several clairvoyantslooking at the same thingmight give totally different accounts of what they saw; yet they might each makecorrect deductions. (page#145)And then again, they might not. Thus it can be seen that the astral observationsor creations of two or moreindividuals will correspond to each other only by chance or by predeterminedcollaboration, which makes the idea ofeffective communication or conference on the astral plane an invalid concept.This by no means rules out telepathyor clairvoyance, but these phenomena do not necessarily have anything to do withthe astral plane per se - if theydid, we would find less divergence in accounts of astral experiences.Since the nature and details of experiences on the astral plane are so variedamong individuals and so closelyrelated to individual consciousness, it should be glaringly obvious [though mostoccultists are too blinded by theconditioning influence of tradition to see the connection] that the astral planeis actually a product of the humanmind. It has no objective existence. The astral plane is not a place, but astate of consciousness. Yet its nonexistencedoes not really matter. It is irrelevant as long as the concept of an astralplane has a personal value for the individualmagician. Astral projection and creation still have their uses.[A contemporary occultist who has kept up with current parapsychologicalresearch would probably argue atthis point that the bioluminescent energy fields photographed by the Kirlianprocess are the astral bodies of occulttradition, and that the existence of an astral body implies the existence of anastral state. If this complex of energiesis in fact the astral body, one would expect to be able to photograph aprojecting yogi or magician and not see thefield. However, the emanations cease upon the physical death of an organism, andonly then. Likewise, since theastral plane is said to be on a higher vibratory level than the physical, if thephotographs are of the astral doubles ofphysical organisms, we would expect to see occasional intrusions ofphysically-discarnate astral entities or objectsinto the photographs - which does not occur.]What exactly is astral projection? In a certain philosophical sense it is aflagrant violation of the laws of thephysical universe/God. In the normal, “physical” plane one receives sensoryinput which triggers one’s mental andphysical conditioned-response mechanisms, leading to creation of mental imagesand to physical actions asreactions to external stimuli.Astral projection is a total inversion of this process, enabling the magician tocreate and control private universeof his own design. It is the next step upward in sophistication and complexityfrom the concentration exercisesdescribed by Priest Holt in “The Yoga From Yuggoth”. There is little differencein kind between this sort ofprojection and imagination; the distinction is a crucial one of degree. Aconventional daydream is an example ofwhat is meant by imagination in this context; it is far too crude in detail,aimless in purpose,lacking in directed willto qualify as projection.Mental projection requires an effort of the will sufficient to enable themagician to literally forget the existenceof the physical body and environment. One creates from within instead ofreacting to stimuli from without. Onceone is able to reach this state, it makes no difference “where” the physicalbody is, since one’s sphere of attention canbe projected to the other end of the universe. Mastery of astral technique isobviously difficult to acquire, but it has atremendous advantage in that it can be used under almost any physicalconditions, with or without the facilities of aritual chamber or a library of reference materials. Indeed one can create one’sown astral Temple, as lavishlyappointed as can be desired, complete with Daimonic servitors and familiars, andretire into it for the performanceof one’s rituals.Astral technique is a key to the control of time. Conventional concepts oflinear time do not apply in mentalprojection, just as a tremendously complex dream may take place in only a minuteor two. Far from being a fixedlaw, time can be accelerated or decelerated by the magician. The implications ofthis alone make projection atechnique of incalculable value.An excellent example of astral creation is Lovecraft’s The Dream-Quest ofUnknown Kadath. While he uses theterm “dream” rather than astral projection, the result is the same. A morerecent example is Priest Holt’s “AFantasy” in Voice of the Dragon #II-2. Personal experimentation is stronglyrecommended, for it will be found that- 279 -frequent exercise of this technique will have an abnormally-strengthening effectupon the ability of the mind tocreate - not only on the astral plane, but on the physical as well.- 280 -A28: Film Review: Star Wars- by Alexandra Sarris II°Scroll of Set #II-11, July 1977Coming to your local theater sometime in the near future will be the space epicStar Wars, the newest and mostspectacular science fiction movie to come down the pike since 2001. Time andNewsweek have hailed Star Wars as“this year’s best movie”, “spectacular”, whose special effects “outdo 2001”.Well, they’re absolutely right. Don’t missthis movie. The special effects alone [costing $9.5 million] will boggle yourmind; the battle scenes and thespacecraft are absolutely spectacular; and when the hero’s ship jumps intohyperspace, the audience cheers [not themaneuver - the special effect]. The miniatures are outstanding, and they’re allfrom the studio that brought you2001 - Elstree.The story is pure space opera. The evil Empire and its minion Darth Vader try tocrush the rebel forces with theultimate weapon, a planet destroyer called the Death Star (a spherical,inhabited doomsday machine). The dewy-eyed young hero, Luke Skywalker, his friend smuggler Han Solo, Solo’s copilotChewbacca (an eight-foot highwalking rug), the brave and brainy Princess Leia, and Obi-Wan “Ben” Kenobi, thelast Jedi Knight, combine todestroy the Death Star. You hiss the villains, cheer the heroes, and applaudwhen the Death Star explodes.But the battle is not won by the spectacular pyrotechnics of the rebelfirepower, but rather by Luke’s reliance onthe “Force”. The Jedi Knights, an organization that had kept peace in the galaxyfor thousands of years, tapped intothe “Force”, the energy which surrounds all living things. The Jedi Knights hadthe ability to take the “Force” anddirect it toward a goal by will. The Knights were destroyed by Ben Kenobi’spupil Darth Vader, who had becomecorrupted by the Imperium.Kenobi tries to instruct young Luke Skywalker in the use of the “Force” in onescene of the movie; he forces Luketo let go of his conscious seeing mind and let his inner mind sense and directthe “Force”. All well and good. Later, atthe climax of the movie, Luke must use the “Force” again to direct his weaponsin the destruction of the Death Star.Throughout this whole battle Ben Kenobi makes statements to Luke [mentally] suchas “Use the force, Luke,” “Relyon the Force,” etc., which Luke dismisses as figments of his imagination until,at the last crucial moment, he doestake Ben’s advice and uses the “Force” on his torpedoes.In the preceding paragraph I feel I have summed up the crucial [to Setians]issue in Star Wars. I personallyliked the idea of the “Force” and most particularly the concept of directing the“Force”. However Luke is unsuitedfor using the “Force”. He is exposed to the “Force” by Ben Kenobi somehours/days prior to the battle. Ben wants tomake Luke a Jedi Knight and gives him the key to the “Force”; Luke does not askfor it. Thus Luke does not reallyknow what to do with the concept of the “Force”. Had he been aware of the“Force” before and asked Ben forinstructions on becoming a Jedi Knight, his actual hesitant and reluctant use ofthe “Force” would have beenunthinkable.We as Setians entered the Temple of our own volition - we weren’t pushed,compelled into joining. Therefore weact differently in regards to will. We actively push our minds into directingour will [the key word is “actively”]. Weasked to join; we want to learn and evolve. However Luke was given the key tothe “Force”, and instead of taking thisnew power and exercising it, he merely uses it when he simply has no otherchoice. The application of the “Force” inLuke’s case is merely accidental. He’ll use it again if and when he’s in direstraits, whereas a Setian would direct his/her will from the beginning. For us, using the “Force” would not be accidental.From the loose ends that have been left dangling at the film’s end, we shouldexpect at least one sequel. I wouldbe particularly interested in observing how Luke matures in his ability to usethe “Force”. Most importantly, wouldLuke continue to use the “Force” by accident, or would he in effect evolve intoits use? Luke has received a gift hedoesn’t deserve, and he uses it without real understanding of its value. What heneeds to learn is that using the“Force” is a privilege accorded to very few, and that he should grow with itsuse. Then and only then should he havethe ability to manipulate the “Force”.At any rate, the movie as a whole is worth the price of admission. Even at thehighly-inflated prices ($4.50 inSan Francisco), Star Wars is a blockbuster.- 281 -A29: Setian Science & Technology: The Pentagram of Set- by Benjamin Kracauer II°Scroll of Set #II-12, August 1977The Divine Proportion, symbolized by the Greek letter Φ and numericallyexpressed as the irrational number1.61803 ... is inherent to the geometry of the pentagram as all of its lesser togreater ratios.I quote from the Book of Coming Forth by Night:When I came first to this world, I gave to you my great pentagram, timelessmeasure of beauty throughproportion. And it was shown inverse, that creation and change be exalted aboverest and preservation.As Magus Michael Aquino has pointed out in his Analysis and Commentary, theDivine Proportion, or SacredCut as it was known in ancient Egypt, is the basis for the pentagram’simportance, and the calculation of Φ animportant use of the pentagram’s configuration. The discovery of the DivineProportion by Max Raphael inprehistoric cave paintings, published in his book Prehistoric Cave Paintings,places the Divine Proportion with thefirst known attempts by man to develop an art of figurative and symbolicrepresentation.Of all the properties which researchers have extracted from analysis of theGreat Pyramid at Giza, perhaps onemost significant is its cross-section, a triangle which, if its base be assumedequal to one, the hypotenuse is equal toΦ, and the adjacent side, or apothem, is the square root of Φ.Peter Tompkins, in his Secrets of the Great Pyramid, speculates that since thesquaring of the circle ispractically resolvable as a function of the number Φ, the Pyramid was designedas a tool with which the squaring ofthe circle as well as the cubing of the sphere was possible. Using the (√ Φ) - Φ- 1 triangle, the ancient Egyptianscould construct maps using a Mercator projection from a spherical quadrant of90° latitude onto a flat surface ofequal area. Thus the Divine Proportion provides the key to the resolutionbetween curved surface and flat surface asone of its many unique mathematical properties.Schwaller de Lubicz has analyzed the triangular loincloth worn by pharaohs ondozens of stone reliefrepresentations. He invariably found two angles of the square root of Φ and Φ,which, due to the location of theloincloth, confirmed in his opinion the phallic attribution of the DivineProportion. Similarly Max Raphaelhypothesizes that the Golden Section - using the 19th century name for theDivine Proportion - was the key to form-making of the most profound sort.The Golden Section is the synthesis of space and motion (time). The GoldenSection is the theproportion that creates form and that stresses the universality and unity ofrelations within this form.The sequence of numbers known as the Fibonacci Series, developed by the medievalItalian mathematicianLeonardo Fibonacci (1170-1230), is an additive series in which each term is thesum of the two previous terms.Beginning arbitrarily with the couplet 1,1, we may generate the followingseries: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,etc. As thenumbers increase, the ratio of two adjacent terms approaches closer and closerto the Divine Proportion.An interesting property: adding Fibonacci whole number units to DivineProportion units will generate alogarithm series which, only in this particular instance, is identical to asimple summation series:Summation SeriesLogarithm SeriesΦ= 1.618 ...1.618 ...or Φ1+2Φ= 2.618 ...2.618 ...or Φ1+ 23Φ= 4.236 ...4.236 ...or Φ2+ 34Φ = 6.854 ...6.854 ...or Φ3+ 55Φ = 11.090 ...11.090 ...or ΦIf you will, the above represents a synthesis between geometric growth andarithmetic growth which only theDivine Proportion is capable of achieving.In a remarkable dissertation in architecture done at the University ofPennsylvania by Anne Tyng calledSimultaneous Randomness and Order: The Fibonacci-Divine Proportion as aUniversal Forming Principle, theFibonacci-Divine Proportion (F-DP) is seen manifested in a wide range ofphenomena which span the biological,physical, chemical, psychological, mathematical, and architectural disciplines."},{"pageContent":"An example from genetics is the genetic drift formula which is used to calculatethe percentage of heterozygotespresent in the offspring of the nth generation under conditions of controlledsibmating.- 282 -Plant growth is seen to be controlled by the Divine Proportion, in thepatterning of leaves on a stem, in thewhorl-like arrangement of the florets of a sunflower, and in the scales of apine cone.Jumping to the astronomical scale, Wilson ( Hierarchical Structure in theCosmos) has found Fibonacci rates tooccur in mass limit calculations of planets, stars and galaxies. Muse ( TheFibonacci Study of Consciousness) hasfound the Fibonacci Series in observations of eclipses of the Moon.Pascal’s Triangle contains the odds for head or tails probabilities, giving theratios for head/tail (or boy/girl)occurrences. If one were to draw a series of diagonals through this triangle andtotal the numbers through whicheach given diagonal passes, the sequence of numbers which results will be theFibonacci Series, therefore relatingprobability to the Divine Proportion.The dodecahedron and the icosahedron are the two higher Platonic solids. ThePlatonic solids are the only fiveregular polyhedra possible in three-dimensional space. A regular polyhedron isdefined as having all faces identicaland all angles the same. The three simpler Platonic solids are the tetrahedron,cube, and octahedron. Thedodecahedron and the icosahedron are both based on pentagonal symmetry, andeither one when rotated on an axiswill generate the double heIicaI outline of the DNA molecule. The DNA helix isin plan a decagon figure in which theDivine Proportion appears as the ratio between the radius of a circumscribedcircle and the side of a decagon.In the carbon atom bond one finds a fundamental Fibonacci square roots of 1,2,3right-angled triangle, which isalso the central structure of the three simpler Platonic solids. Deutsch’sexperiments with the nervous system haveindicated the occurrence of the Fibonacci triangle in the spacing of overlappingneuron fields.Another discovery by Deutsch is the occurrence of the number (√5+1)/2 (= Φ) incalculations for nervoussystem stability in experiments with amplifier gain in multisynaptic neuronchains with feedback.The Weber-Fechner Law states that the perception of light intensity in a roomwhich is lit by an unseen sourceof successively 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 13 candles will be perceived as equal changesin lumination by the experimentalobserver. Here the Fibonacci Series is seen to have an intrinsic relationship tothe subjective perceptual apparatusas the basis for vision thresholds. The same relationship applies tothermoreceptors sensitive to cold and warmth,chemoreceptors such as the taste buds, and mechanoreceptors for touch andhearing.Regarding the Fibonacci-Divine Proportion occurrence in scientific studies ofthe human nervous system, Tyngproffers this speculation:The human brain has an immeasured capacity for both randomness and order: Ipropose that thisseeming paradox of simultaneous randomness and order may be resolved by aphysical statistical matrix ofFibonacci-Divine Proportion linkage.I propose that as a matrix for the human brain, the Fibonacci-Divine Proportionforming principleincludes the processes for probability and for order for the brain’sevolutionary origins and sets no limit tothe future evolution of the human brain and its creativity; within such a matrixthe brain forms as it is beingformed.The pentagram is a symbolic structure of Divine Proportion linkages whichprobably relates to allmanifestations of form in this universe. The pentagram’s geometry is constructedso that every line segment is inDivine Proportion with another line segment, within a symmetry which issimultaneously radial and bilateral.Insofar as the Divine Proportion represents a universal forming principle, thepentagram embodies a paradigmaticstructure representing the means by which a universe of infinite complexity istheoretically possible such that itsparts, however diverse, relate to each other in the aspiration towards anoverall consistency.The Book of Coming Forth by Night relates the pentagram to the faculty ofcreation. Johannes Kepler saw theconvergence of the Fibonacci Series on the Divine Proportion as symbolic ofcreation:It is in the likeness of this self-developing series that the faculty ofpropagation is, in my opinion,formed; and so in a flower the authentic flag of this faculty is flown, thepentagon.Kepler saw the pentagon as being symbolic of the form-making potentiality of theFibonacci-Divine Proportion.The pentagram, however, is a far richer construction, as it contains all thepentagonal diagonals intersecting eachother in Divine Proportion, while clearly alluding to the pentagonal form withits radial points and actuallycontaining a fully-formed pentagon in its center.The potentiality of the pentagram within the pentagon is far more subtle andtherefore hidden. Yet thepentagram is as simple a form as the pentagon, as both are composed of fiveequal line segments intersecting atequal angles. While the pentagon stresses the autonomy of its forming segments,the pentagram posits a series offormal linkages with intentions of an ordered richness of interaction. Thepentagon is explicitly formed within thepentagram; the pentagon contains the pentagram only by implication. Theasymmetry between these two formsestablishes the primacy and ascendancy of the pentagram as the true symbol ofthe potentialities of creation whichthe Divine Proportion seems to represent.- 283 -ReferencesTyng, Anne Griswold, Simultaneous Randomness and Order: The Fibonacci-DivineProportion as aUniversal Forming Principle.

A Saint is one who “becomes onewith God”, who gives up hisidentity to become part of God, who willingly and willfully follows only thewill of God [”God” here may be “the one”,“the all”, the universe, the racial subconscious, or whatever]. A Set (referringto a generic type, rather than Set itself)is one who establishes an identity, an individuality, as completely separatedfrom God. Between these extremes lieall types of people.Just what does it take to be a Saint? The Saint-to-be must decide to become aSaint [to follow the will of Godonly]! He must decide what is needed to do this and how to personally effect therequired changes. He must then doit. He must continually evaluate his life, advancement, and methods and mustchange them as required.The Set-to-be must discover the qualities of Set. He needs to determine how todevelop these qualities inhimself. He must make these changes. He must repeatedly review his methods andtheir results and improve on themethods.Being a Saint requires intelligence and the will to follow the path to Sainthooddespite all temptations. There arefew Saints. There are few Sets. Sainthood and Sethood require similar strengthand will. Only the direction isdifferent.Between these extremes are all types of people. The majority of people do notwish to be at either extreme.Others do not have the intelligence to determine their path. Others do not havethe will to follow their chosen path.Setians have chosen their path, are learning the methods, and are exercisingtheir wills.Good and evil are opposites. There are good acts and evil acts. There are goodpeople who perform good acts,evil people who perform evil acts, and all types of people in between. Peopleare judged by what they do.Good and evil are external attributes. Sainthood and Sethood are internalattributes. Good is as good does. Set isas Set is.Traditionally Saints are considered to be good and magicians evil. Traditionallythe will of God is good;therefore those who oppose it and follow their own individual wills must beevil. It ain’t necessarily so.A Saint becomes one with God; a Saint follows the will of God, for good, evil,or indifference.Setians striving for Sethood must concentrate on their individuality and act asdetermined by their own will fortheir own advancement. [Good and evil acts still have relevance for the Setian,since society “judges” us by thisexternal attribute. A good Setian will have less interference from society thanan evil Setian - an Indifferent Setianperhaps even less.]Setians are beyond good and evil. However this should not be because we don’tcare whether we do good or evil,but rather because we act for the total value of the act, rather than simplybecause an act is good or evil.Are there examples of how a Setian might behave, other than those given by ourPriests, Masters, and Magus?Sainthood and Sethood are so similar that we might examine Saintly behavior andfrom it extrapolate “Setly”behavior.Saint Francis is among the most revered of Saints. He found his way toSainthood, trod it willfully and willingly,and became a Saint. He Xeper ed. Saint Francis performed few if any good acts.He did not preach to the world. Hedid not condemn those who did not follow his path. He did not even lead hisfollowers; he simply permitted them toaccompany him. Saint Francis discovered his own path and followed it. Anyleadership was by example.Anita Bryant has also chosen a path. Her path, however, leads not throughpersonal Xeper. Rather she is tryingto mold the world to fit her own personal, as yet limited concepts. She will notXeper. She is stirring up muchpsychic ill will, and we know how dangerous such ill will can be.Saints and Sets must Xeper. Only then may they accomplish their goal. Chooseyour own path and follow it. Thefirst step of Setamorphosis is internal.- 285 -A31: How an Eclipse Happens, as related by Bast to her Kittens- by Margaret Wendall IV°Scroll of Set #III-3, November 1977Once upon a time Sekhmet was awakened from her noon nap by all the living thingson Earth and by all thegods and goddesses, because Apep was daring to eat Ra in front of them, and theywere all frightened.But all the gods and goddesses knew that Sekhmet could save Ra. Sekhmet got up,snarling at being so rudelyawakened. Like all felines she enjoys her noon naps in little patches ofsunlight under big trees. But the other godsand goddesses prevailed and calmed Sekhmet as they explained the seriousness ofthe situation.Sekhmet is used to that upstart Apep trying to eat Ra each afternoon and causingit to get dark all over theEarth. Even though she enjoys the darkness of night, when she can hunt under thegem-like stars strewn on the softdarkness, she also knows that if she doesn’t save Ra, all life will perish. Ifshe doesn’t save Ra, her own existence isin peril, so every night, Sekhmet scares Apep and makes him vomit Ra up and puthim back together again, just intime for Ra to get into the barque that carries him across the daytime sky.This day, however, Apep must have slithered into Ra’s barque, hiding until thedastardly deed was to be done.Sekhmet cast aside her fear of swimming and set out for the barque. The fightfor Ra had begun. Luckily for all livingthings, and for all the gods and goddesses, Apep had only begun to eat Ra whenSekhmet climbed into the barque.She pounced on Apep, roaring and with claws and fangs bared, and scared Apep somuch that he let go of Raafter only one bite. Apep spat that up and, with a paw on Apep, Sekhmet herselfput Ra back together again. Thenshe took Apep in her mouth, jumped back into the sky, and returned to Earth.The wily Apep slithered out of her mouth and got away, but Sekhmet knew he’d beback later in the afternoon,just when Ra’s barque would be landing. So she lay down to wait for him, purringat her great accomplishment. Allthe living things and gods and goddesses gave loud cheers of thanks to Sekhmetfor saving Ra, and for saving them.And this is why you don’t ever need to worry about Ra. As long as Sekhmet ishere, waiting for his barque, shewill protect him from Apep, and we’ll have our little patches of sunlight tokeep warm in, while we wait for thedarkness and the good hunting it brings.Curl up, my kittens, and go back to sleep. You’re safe.- 286 -A32: Setward Evolution- by Robert Menschel II°Scroll of Set #III-4, December 1977All life on Earth is undergoing continual evolution.Mankind’s most notable physical evolution to date has been his brain. Man firstused his brain to simplysurvive. He learned to use tools, then to construct tools, and then to shape hisenvironment.Man has learned universal laws. We understand thermodynamics, and usethermodynamics. We continue tolearn; we continue to use what we learn.Man also evolves socially. Man is learning ethics. Discrimination is lessening.People are being given the chanceto fulfill their potential as never before. More and more, people are permittedto follow [or not follow] their religionsas they individually desire.The animal kingdom evolves [mostly] physically. Man appears to evolve[primarily] mentally. All our aboveprocesses are continuing, still evolving, just as other species continue toevolve. Further, because our mentalevolution does not require concurrent physical change, it apparently happensfaster than physical evolution would.Two hundred years ago there was a white moth, as white as the trees upon whichit rested. Colored mutations ofthe moth were spied, and eaten by predators. These moths live in industrialEngland. The birches are now speckled,as is the species. White mutations are now the ones that get seen - and eaten.Evolution is continual, and occurs in many directions. The moth is still withus, evolved. The dodo didn’t make it- the first known case of evolutionary failure: extinction.Man has learned/is learning universal laws. We are now, finally, scientificallystudying psychic phenomena. Weare applying scientific methods to examine the statistics, possible causes, andpossible effects of psychic powers.This is yet another direction of mankind’s evolution.I see four lines of evolution into our development and use of psychic powers:•There are the traditional magicians, who explore the unknown, blindly pushing inall directions,superstitiously grabbing at any method that works, jealously hiding theiradvances from competitors.•There are the psychics, who simply do what they do. They may use their gift orfear it. They generally donot attempt to study it.•There are the scientists, who study the unknown carefully, precisely, seeing andrecording whathappens [if it happens]. They are proving that, yes, something is happening.•The fourth and newest group is the Temple of Set. We follow the dark, blindpaths of the magicians,using the bright lights of the scientists. Yes, this works! Reduce it to theworking minimum and use it,study it, improve on it, and continue past it to the next discovery, to the nextuse of our powers.We combine science and magic as has never been done before. The Temple isevolving quickly, successfully. TheElect are also evolving. I feel that this indicates our pathway of evolution isa successful one.But then our path is the one that Set would have us travel. “For mankind nowhastens toward an annihilationwhich none but the Elect may hope to avoid.” Ours is apparently the strongestevolutionary path open.There is evolution as a species. Is there evolution as an individual?There is a theory of “karmic” evolution: that souls progress and evolve througha succession of lives and deathstowards perfection ( nirvana, sainthood, etc.).I personally do not [yet] believe in reincarnation. However if reincarnationdoes take place, then I believe in theevolution of the soul. This evolution of the soul may not be the cause of thesocial evolutions noted above.If the soul evolves, it is reasonable to assume that the individual involvedevolves during his/her lifetime, Ihappen to believe that the individual does evolve within a lifetime. I see theseindividual evolutions. Whether thisgrowth is limited to one lifetime or covers many is immaterial.Further this individual evolution seems to match mankind’s social evolution.There are scientists, academicians,magicians, slaves, dictators, slave owners, democrats, and Setians. Eachindividual has reached that given point [orpoints] in an individual evolution.If the soul evolves across lifetimes, then it is reasonable to assume that thosesouls which have evolved thefarthest are inhabiting the individuals that are at the head of theirevolutionary path. If this is the only life we get,then the individuals who have evolved the most in this lifetime are the leadersin their respective paths.When the slaves and/or slaveowners evolve away from their current state [as themoth above evolved], or dieout [as did the dodo], then those evolutionary conditions will be at an end.As indicated above, Setians are the leading wave of the strongest [in potential,not numbers] evolutionary trendtoday. [In their Morning of the Magicians Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier hintat others who trod this pathbefore us, but Set apparently makes no mention of these.] Where might our futureevolution lead?- 287 -Man has the power to alter his environment, and this power becomes strongerevery day. Man can evolve so thatthe environment is totally controlled by man, so that the environment centersupon man, so that the environmentbecomes man and man the environment.But even Set “cannot destroy the Cosmic Inertia without having to assume itsplace”. Set “could achieve identityonly by becoming what the Cosmic order was not”.Setians, therefore, must lead in the other direction. It is imperative for eachof us to keep the “I” separate anddistinct from the “not-l”. Just as “HarWer must exist while Set exists”, weshould each define the “not-l” so that wemay better define the “I”, better be the “I”.Our evolutionary path includes this definition of the “not-l”, the definition ofthe “I”. As the “I” and the “not-l”become more distinct, we will know the “I” better, will know better what isrequired to evolve, and will evolve, willXeper.This is one path an individual might choose for evolution, and everyevolutionary path has its dangers. Indeed itseems that the higher the evolutionary path, the greater (more dramatic, moredisastrous) the dangers may be.Every path has the danger of being a weak path. Note the dodo. These paths facethe simple danger of beingsurpassed by other, more successful, stronger paths.Mankind treads the highest evolutionary pathways we see on Earth. Yet mankind isheaded for catastrophe.Setians tread the foremost point of mankind’s path, and magic is dangerous. Itis repeatedly stated in theTemple that the danger from White Magic is minimal. However it is there. MagusAquino reports that Black Magicis more dangerous that White. Magister Seago has confirmed to me that theresults of magical imbalance at the IV°are more dangerous than at the III°. I imagine greater dangers yet upon becominga Magus.“To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to break his Self-reference to the boundsin which his semblance mustexist.” Magus LaVey was “raised to the Will of a Daimon”. This was a growth, adanger, for which he was neitherprepared nor ready.Where does our evolution lead? It may lead to Daimonhood and insanity. It may bea blind path, doomed toeventual extinction.It may lead to Sethood.My goal is not to attain Sethood, not Priesthood, nor even to become Adept. Mypersonal goal is to Xeper,through all the means I can discover, consciously, willfully, to evolve, toXeper.I expect Sethood as I evolve, and then whatever comes after Sethood; these arebut names to temporary steps ina continuing evolution. My goal is to consciously find, and willfully follow,the path of successful, ever higher, evergreater evolution.- 288 -A33: The Subjective Universe and Life After Death- by Richard D. Murad II°Scroll of Set #III-4, December 1977“Death” is a word which stirs many ideas in our minds, most of which do not sitvery comfortably with us. Thethought that from non-existence we have come, and in a relatively short periodof time to non-existence we mayperhaps again return, is a thought which digs deep into the very nature of ourbeing. The Temple of Set does notofficially concern itself with life after death, as indeed it should not. Thisdoes not mean, however, that we cannotspeculate on it. What follows is such a speculation.Before I present my ideas, it is important to consider objective and subjectivereality, and the universes in whicheach dwells.What is objective reality? It is “God”. It is the universe [out there] and allthe laws which apply therein. It ismatter and energy, and all the relationships which apply to either or both. Itis not our perceptions of them, but thethings in and of themselves.What it subjective reality? It is our many various and diverse perceptions of“God” in all its aspects.It is also much, much more. It is our dreams and our fantasies. It is our ownpersonal and private universe.“God”’s laws need not apply in our universe if we so choose. Our universe can befilled with whatever creatures orbeings we wish. In it, one day we can be hunters, the next day we can be kings.There are no holes barred. We aresupreme in it. In our subjective universe we are “God”, and only we rule.It is here where astral projection must be brought into the picture. The astraluniverse has no objectiveexistence. [Cf. “Rituals Without Chambers” by Magister L. Dale Seago, in Scroll#II-11.] It is completely a subjectivecreation. It exists only in the mind.This does not make the astral world less valid, however. To the magician, theastral world is just as valid, if notmore valid than the objective one. [Of course, as long as our bodies, whichunfortunately are of “God”, must exist inobjective reality, we cannot lose touch with that reality.]So what does all this have to do with life, or more precisely, existence afterphysical death? When a personenters into the astral world, objective reality is left behind. Of course, whilethe body is still functioning, one canreturn to objective reality. Now if the physical body stops functioning, perhapsall that is left is the astral universe.What am I saying? Perhaps when a person dies, that person enters into his owncompletely subjective universe,completely detached from objective existence. The characteristics andappearances of this astral world would bedetermined either knowingly by the conscious mind, unknowingly by thesubconscious mind, or by a combination ofboth parts of the mind in varying degrees. This theory could explain the manydifferent reports given by people withexperiences similar to that of Adept Knaust [ Scroll #III-2].Of course this would raise a few questions. One would be: How long would thisstate last? Another and moreimportant question would be: Could we ever contact or influence objectivereality from our astral universe?In reference to the first question, the stronger and more developed wills wouldprobably last longer and theentirely underdeveloped wills would probably experience nothing at all anddissolve into nonexistence. [Of coursethe concept of “how long” would be meaningless, because time is nothing morethan a relation of events. In ourastral universe, we control all events and that makes us, in our astral world,among other things, masters of time.]And in reference to the second question my answer is as follows: Perhapsreaching out of our subjectiveuniverse and touching objective reality is what magic is all about.- 289 -A34: Close Encounters of the Second Degree- by Michael A. Aquino V°Scroll of Set #III-5, January 1978In the November 1977 supplement to the Scroll, I reviewed the concept of the I°- essentially a “screeningprocess” to ensure that an individual and the Temple of Set can make an informeddecision concerning theirsuitability for one another. When properly Recognized, the II° should indicatethat the individual is satisfied withthe magical and philosophical premises of the Temple; it should also indicatethat the Temple is satisfied with theindividual’s potential for exploring, understanding, and applying those samepremises.The II° Recognition is regarded quite seriously by the Priesthood of Set. Nocorruption in the process istolerated, and mistakes in Recognition - when they come to light - are correctedpromptly. Per the Temple By-Lawsany III°+ has the authority to downgrade and/or expel any I° or II° for cause.All such decisions are reviewed toensure fairness, but the point is that magical “imbalances” at any level of theTemple are not permitted to continuemerely for the sake of convenience. [It might be noted that the same principleapplies at III°+ levels.]There are two reasons that access to some of the major systems and researchmaterials of the Temple iswithheld until the II°. The first is that, when a I° is being evaluated for theII°, it is important that his/her intrinsicphilosophical, academic, and magical aptitudes be measured. If someone weremerely to parrot Temple doctrineswithout really comprehending them or forming opinions as to their validity,distortion would occur. The qualitiesthat we are looking for in an Adept are already present before exposure tospecialized Temple material. It must beremembered that the Temple does not “make silk purses out of sows’ ears”. It israther a “machine” forconcentrating an already-present ability of certain individuals (the Elect).The second reason is that, were we to permit it, the Temple would be vampirizedby the “occult subculture”.Persons would join simply to gain access to the Scroll, the Ruby Tablet, etc.,with no interest or intellectualcommitment beyond that. Hence the II° Recognition as a precondition. This forcesthe would-be “armchairoccultist” to either come out of his shell or be processed out of the Templeafter the end of the 2-year I° time limit.So when an individual is properly recognized as an Adept, what then? What do wemean by the title? What canand/or should the individual do as a consequence? What lies ahead, and wheredoes the III° fit into the picture? Letme address each one of these questions in turn:In the terminology of initiatory magic, an Adept is one who understands and cansuccessfully employ thephilosophy and techniques of the school or discipline in question. That thetitle may have been abused by charlatansfrom time to time is of no import, any more than the occasional abuse of thetitle “doctor” reflects adversely onproperly-qualified Ph.D./M.D. recipients.Is a Temple of Set Adept immediately qualified as such by this definition? Ofcourse not. The II° is conferred asa recognition of potential for Coming Into Being as an Adept, not as an “end ofthe achievement award”. There isno such thing as a “complete” II° within the scope of the Temple, since theconcept of Xeper is one of expandingcomprehension and magical evolution. To say much the same thing in Socraticterms, it is far easier to say what anAdept is not than what one is.So you have just been recognized as an Adept. What do you do now? A II° steleand card will be sent to youautomatically, but you must order the II° medallion and the Ruby Tablet fromMagistra Wendall. At that point thedirection in which you Xeper is completely up to you. As is the case with theScroll, the Ruby Tablet is designed tobe a two-way channel of communication. You can use it for information andreference, and you can submit ideasand research of your own for inclusion in it.You will discover very quickly (if you haven’t already) that the concept ofmagic in the Temple of Set is a verybroad one. A person who seeks in ceremonial magic a small, cozy eccentricity inwhich to build a psychological nestis destined to be disappointed, because an axiom of magic is that the mostaccurate assessment of any phenomenonis the one which treats it in the widest possible context. The magician is onewho can “see the big picture” anddetermine the appropriate controls for guiding it towards desired ends. Suchcontrol will seem “magical” tosomeone who sees the same situation from an incomplete perspective. This is wellillustrated in John Fowles’ TheMagus.Since the vistas before an Adept are so overwhelming, some new lI°s experience asort of “magical agoraphobia”.This is predictable and understandable. The solution is simply to work out acomfortably-paced program of interestsand priorities. Then one can Xeper at a rate which is both enjoyable andstimulating. Caution must be taken to avoidbecoming “intoxicated” by the experience to the extent that one becomes a“magical addict”. [If that is allowed tohappen, the Adept’s perspective on the mundane world will suffer distortion,magical operations will come to losetheir objective effectiveness, and the Adept’s sphere of magical influence willshrink to purely-subjectivedimensions.]I often advise magicians to balance their esoteric interests with some demandingactivity in the mundane world,so that they may “step outside of their magical personalities” and seethemselves in social context. Aleister Crowleywas climbing mountains when he embarked upon his magical career; Anton LaVey wasa lion-trainer in a circus; Iwas an officer in a paratrooper division. Today in the Temple some of our mostsuccessful magicians are those withsurprisingly-exoteric outside interests.- 290 -Why is there so much talk about communications systems in the Temple? Becausemagic must becommunicated to exist. You may argue that this is not true - that one canexperience a purely-personal magicalphenomenon. But I would say to you: Until you have rendered that experience intolanguage, you yourself willneither be able to understand it nor be able to do anything with it. And themoment you succeed in translating it foryourself, you have made it understandable by other Adepts.Such an accomplishment distinguishes a magician (who communicates his visionsand draws meaningfulconclusions from them) from a mystic (who floats in a dream-world which neitherhe nor anyone else canunderstand). Once again Crowley is a prime case in point, because he was able tocommunicate his magicalphilosophy so profoundly that he himself was immortalized by it.So the oft-repeated advice for you to write ... letters, articles, essays,poems, stories, newsletters, books ... has avalid, magical motive behind it. No matter how helpful your writings may proveto others, you will be the primebeneficiary, because you are thereby forcing your thoughts to crystallize intolanguage ... and then you will begin toreally understand and evaluate them.Have you ever paused to wonder why it takes such an effort of will to write apaper or letter? It is preciselybecause the process demands that you force vague, ethereal emotions, feelings,and sensations into inductive ordeductive statements. [One encouraging note: The task becomes easier withpractice.]Occasionally I am asked whether a II° is expected to “progress towards” theIII°. The very question is amisconception of the degree system. The III° is not a “continuation” of the II°into a higher echelon of expertise. Infact I think I would be correct in saying that there are a number of II°s whoare more skilled in their areas of magicalspecialty than all of the III°+ - including myself.Recognition to the III° may indicate no philosophical or magical refinement fromthe II° level at all, although itmay seem that way because an Adept’s magical expertise will normally continue togrow from the time of II°Recognition. Rather the III° is a recognition that the individual possesses acertain very singular quality identifyingthe Priesthood of Set.It is difficult to say whether the III° is something that can be attained byeffort or whether the characteristicsthat identify a Priest or Priestess are imparted from outside the self. Mostlikely it is a combination of the two.A final point about Temple of Set degrees that I should like to clear upinvolves their permanence. These degreesare not awards or certificates of completion that are bestowed; they are arecognition of an individual’s stateof being. And an individual can exercise the freedom of will to move in anydirection or combination of directions.Hence it is entirely within the realm of possibility that a III° may “move” tothe II° without any punitive ordegrading connotations whatever. The same holds true for “travel” from otherdegrees. If this principle is notrealized, then the true nature of the degree-system is being corrupted into aone-way, ratchet-like process.When you think about it, you will see why such a concept would be inconsistentwith the presupposition of freewill and the requirement that a Temple degree reflect an individual’s actualstate of being. The Temple By-Laws domake it more difficult to withdraw a degree than to Recognize it, but this alsohas a basis in reason. The higher thedegree, the more difficult it is to make a judgment concerning what therecipient must do to violate the scope of thatdegree. So there is a sort of “built-in benefit of the doubt” accorded with eachdegree. Only in essentially clear cases,then, are degree imbalances considered for correction.I hope that this has helped to clear up some of the considerations involved inthe II° - which in some ways is the“Alpha and Omega” of the Temple. If you have other questions on the topic, feelwelcome to discuss them with anyII°+. Unlike other esoteric societies, the Temple maintains no artificial gamesof secrecy about its degree system. Wedon’t have to. The “secrets”, such as they are, cannot be communicated to thosewho are not able to understandthem. And those who can understand them should know about them.[index-291_1.png][index-291_2.png][index-291_3.png]- 291 -A35: The Integrated Self- by Alexandra Sarris II°Scroll of Set #III-6, February 1978The Set/HarWer dichotomy exists in the microcosm as well as in the macrocosm. Inour own way each of uscarries within us this balance - within our own minds.The Setian has realized before becoming a Setian the complexities of the humanmind, if only through exposureto theories or conceptions of Freud, Jung, and the like, and their divisions ofthe human mind. Psychology andpsychoanalysis are favorite topics as human beings endeavor to “find themselves”through one theory or another.They vaguely grope toward an understanding of their subconscious and unconsciousselves, hopefully reaching aresolution of the turmoils within themselves.It is, I think, only within the realm of the Setian, however, to understand andsolve the problems inherent in thesubconscious and unconscious Aspects, through our unique viewpoint andmethodology. I propose a newinterpretation of the mind and its structure [as seen by Setians], although themodel itself has been used insomewhat different form.In the diagram provided, four elements are shown: the Core Self (CS), theFunction Personality [FP], theMagical Entity [ME], and the various other Aspects (A).The Core Self sits at the center of the wheel, much as it exists at the centerof our mind; it is the coordinator, thehub, the ultimate self. The function personality is our mundane self - what theCore Self needs to keep usfunctioning and surviving in this outer world. The anonymous Aspects are thevarious Aspects of self beyond thefunction personality (which is itself an Aspect, though the most dominant andhardly the best). The [trapezoidal]“Magical Entity” is our channel from the Core Self to the Aspects and beyond.Let me enlarge further on these elements. The Core Self exists in all of us, thebasis for our being, our center ofthe mind. In some cultures it may be called a “soul”; the Egyptians named it theba.Surrounding the Core Self are the Aspects, spinning and revolving likesatellites around a planet, ever changingand growing. Each one provides a different dimension of relationship to the CoreSelf and to the functionpersonality, and all are fed by the energy of the Core Self.Without the Core Self, Aspects would not exist. They form our idiolects. Eachperson has a different set; someAspects are more distinct than others, and often they overlap. All of themappreciate being out in conscious realityonce in a while, but that role is reserved for the function personality - thedominant Aspect that does yeoman servicein the mundane world 95% of the time.We all know, some too well, the function personality. We rise with it, survive,and go to sleep with it. This is ourpublic face. Yet there are times when it slips and another Aspect peeps through:a different entity - softer, harder,more romantic, etc. The anonymous Aspects also may be summoned by the functionpersonality at times.The function personality derives its energy from the Core Self more than theother Aspects because it performsfar more often. Unfortunately this public face becomes the private face; thefunction personality wants all functionsand becomes completely dominant. The underling becomes a petty tyrant who wouldrule without regard to orwillingness to understand what lies within, much as a “strange and fitfulpresence”, working its will as it sees fit,almost - since it has a logic and rationality of its own derived from its ownlimited, necessarily one-sided experience- expressing a “truth ever tinged in ... irrationality and inconsistency”.HarWer, embodying a fitful, irrational, and inconsistent being, could achieveidentity only by being Set’sopposite self. Ironically the function personality shares the same traits; forwithout oneness, there can be nobalance. Without an equal alternative, only one distorted viewpoint can exist,with no clear comprehension of thewhole picture.Essentially when the function personality dominates to the exclusion ofeverything else, the being can only seedown a narrow tunnel. Too many people see with these blinders and believe itreal; others recognize that more thanthe function personality exists but choose either to ignore the situation orwork toward resolving the damagewrought by the function personality. This may mean uncovering the subconsciousscars and working out theanguish to one’s satisfaction and a better understanding of self. This processis a laudable one, but it does not- 292 -ultimately satisfy. [Indeed what is required is an integration of all elementsinto a “superbeing”, as will be discussedbriefly later.]The function personality as tyrant believes that it is final arbiter of ideas -that all good and logical conceptsderive from it. When it is strong, the Aspects have great difficulty in findingexpression. [Thus, a rigid and narrow-minded function personality will not allow the creative and indulgent Aspects toemerge, rather, setting up its ownexpectations.]In this microcosm, the function personality expresses the reality of HarWer. Itestablishes its own rationalityand logic; it acts as censor, choosing what it will hear, what it willunderstand, absorb, distort, ignore; and it protectsitself by building walls, not only toward the outside world but also against itsfellow Aspects and the Core Self. Bydoing so, the function personality stays dominant. Should these walls bebreached, disaster will strike. From theoutside, it can be devastating to the whole being; from the inside, it can allowthe formation of a new reality.There is continual pressure from the Aspects and Core Self on the functionpersonality. If the functionpersonality becomes weakened through crisis, the other Aspects can burst intoconsciousness.Just as Set is the ageless intelligence of the universe, so is the Core Self theageless intelligence of the being.Oddly enough the evolution from the Æon of Horus [with its concurrent imbalanceand onesidedness] has in itsprogression to the Æon of Set [and balance] a parallel in the evolution of theSetian mind.Regard the elements. We have the Core Self (the ageless intelligence) with itsAspects, of which the functionpersonality is the strongest and most relentless (the disordered intelligence);yet we have a bridge that leads fromthe Core Self to all Aspects - the Magical Entity, of which we have spokenlittle. Basically, the Magical Entity allowsthe Core Self to supersede the function personality, and reintegrate the Aspectsinto a new self.There are those who actively create their magical personalities, feeding themthe energy to be in fact what theyare in imagination; and in this instance the Magical Entity may be conceived ofas a construct of traits from thevarious Aspects surrounding the Core Self. For those whose magical selves arisespontaneously: Are theseconstructs, fashioned in the depths by the Core Self, or rather available andappropriate Aspects that fit the presentand future need of the Setian?Whether we actively will a personality from an available Aspect that fits ourgoals, or whether we combinevarious attributes from different Aspects into a new Aspect, what we do have isthe Magical Entity, our new andviable alternative to the function personality. We forge lines of force betweenthis Aspect and the Core Self and theother Aspects.This Magical Entity also serves the purpose of bypassing the functionpersonality’s barriers by attacking thebarriers on an entirely different level than the function personality has dealtwith. [The function personality is usedto combat assaults on it at a mundane level, hardly a magical one.] The MagicalEntity then becomes a channel ofthe Core Self as we send our energies through it and out by our will through thepentagram.This cannot be done by the function personality; it simply blocks or severelycensors. The Magical Entity, whichhas none of those barriers, can channel the will through it. And yet thedisputatious function personality intrudes,causing disruption as simply as in providing active doubt as to the validity ofa working once out of the ritualchamber. [How many of us have said, “That really didn’t happen, did it?” Andthat: “It seems really ridiculous in the‘light of day’.”] The function personality serves best at ridicule andchastisement, using these weapons ofintimidation toward subservience to its will.And yet, when we are our Magical Entities, we find the arguments of the functionpersonality specious and silly.Also the Magical Entity, by overwhelming the function personality, allows theenergies of the other Aspects and theCore Self to become exposed. [In psychological terms, the subconscious, i.e. theAspects and the unconscious, (theCore Self) are revealed.] These ideas and feelings become visible; no longer canwe claim the ignorance ofunconscious acts. Instead the creation of the Magical Entity allows us to godeep within ourselves and sift throughour presently unexposed self.In the realm of magic such an examination must be done. To leave such hiddendimensions alone would be toinvite terrible retribution in the later workings. With the magical Aspect sostrong, there is no limit to the energythat can be conjured up. When the demons that lurk in the unconscious alsoreceive the benefits of this evolutionaryenergy, all Hell can break loose. [Cf. L.D. Seago IV°, “Psychic Hazards andProper Use of Ritual Magic”, Scroll #I-3,11/X.]Ultimately the Magical Entity helps in the integration of the Setian. The goalof the Setian is to evolve, and oneof the first steps in any sort of evolution is learning about the self. Then thevarious elements should be nudged inthe same direction.Imagine a herd of cattle, with a cowboy riding herd on them as they all wanderdown to the railhead. Some trotoff, others plod along, and the leader barrels ahead of the herd. This cowboy isour will, which emanates from theCore Self, and the different Aspects are all the cattle that have been pushed,plodding, in the same direction. TheMagical Entity is the leader with its conception of the ultimate “goal”, and thefunction personality is the maverickwho wants to do its own thing, as it has done for these too many years.The fusion ultimately of all of these Aspects together under the guidance of theMagical Entity is in a sense anenhancement of the Core Self’s will and the evolution of a new self which willincorporate all the Aspects in itself.The Magical Entity is the channel of this new self, and the functionpersonality, though still existing, has beenrelegated to a primarily minor position, performing its mundane functionswithout tyranny.- 293 -In Freudian terms this may be considered the triumph of the “ego”. In magicalterms we have the integratedself, which is evolving and metamorphizing, always changing and yet progressing.This integrated self carries with itall the power that has been frittered away by the divergent Aspects, nowcombined in one and all directed at thesame goal. To bend one’s will and know that one’s whole being is directed behindone’s will is an achievement of thisintegration.- 294 -A36: Implications of Elitism- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #III-6, February 1978At a recent meeting of the Sekhmet Pylon, a member took exception to my“fanaticism” and my apparentattitude that the Temple of Set embodies “the only true religion”. It seems tome that this should be clarified. If thisorganization is in fact the Temple of Set, then ours is the true religion. If itis not the Temple of Set, which thePrince of Darkness has himself ordained, then it is merely another magical order... and there was no point in theresignations of its founders from what they saw had become merely the Church ofAnton LaVey. If the concepts andprinciples set forth in the Book of Coming Forth by Night do not issue from Set,then ours is a false religion itself.The Temple has been founded upon the ability of its Initiates to perceivecertain Forms (in the Platonic sense)and principles, patterns, and relationships which are not apparent to ordinaryhumans; and upon their ability toapply their perceptions and understanding of these things to their lives [i.e.“magic”]. It is this perceptive faculty,together with its application, which distinguishes the Elect from the human andplaces the former upon a superiorlevel. It is also the reason why our initiatory system of advancement is aprocess of recognition as opposed toadministrative/ organizational “elevation”.“Elitism” has become a dirty word in our egalitarian-oriented society. It isconsidered “not nice”, impolite, to bebetter than the masses. But if the Temple of Set is authentic, then its membersare elite. And the logicalconsequence of their elitism must be considered: Millions of humans areimpoverished and starving. Do you have a“duty to humanity” to aid them? Will you give of your own substance and reduceyourself to their level in the hope ofbringing them partway up to yours? Will you expend your time, your energies,your intellectual qualities, on themasses - or on your own kind from whom you can expect a reciprocal commitment?Do the non-Elect deserve asmuch consideration from you as the Elect? If you are truly Elect, and betterthan they are, do the non-Elect deserveany consideration from you at all?I seek my Elect and none other ... and I think not of those who think not of me.This does not mean a Setian may not have non-Elect friends and associates. Thereis generally some kind ofreciprocal benefit in such relationships, or they would not be entered into; thenon-Setian may be entertaining andamusing, possess some skill which you can either learn or persuade him to employon your behalf, etc.From an Elect standpoint, however, there are three kinds of people: the Elect,the potentially Elect, and the non-Elect. On first meeting people, it may not be immediately apparent to whichcategory they belong. My own policy inany case where doubt exists is to treat them as potentially Elect until theyprove themselves otherwise. If they showthemselves to be non-Elect, the following options are open:1. Cooperate with them as long as paths and goals are congruent.2. Ignore them if they are neither a help nor a hindrance to your own plans.3. If you have nothing they need/want but they have something you need, usethem. Find some way to getit at their expense rather than your own. [Advertising agencies do it all thetime by creating an artificialneed in a person in order to obtain the money they want from him.]4. If they are hostile, or a potential or actual threat:(a) Avoid them;(b) Educate or mislead them so they no longer threaten you;(c) Control them;(d) Destroy them.Who has the moral right to decide whether someone should be made a tool of, oreven destroyed? If the Electare the Elect, then they have that right. The Setian must take upon himself theresponsibility of tracing theconsequences of his convictions to their logical conclusions. If he finds hecannot stomach those conclusions, heshould reexamine the foundations of his convictions. To be a successful Setianrequires the unceasing anddiscriminating use of one’s mind, and a most precise and delicate sense ofintellectual balance. In dealings withthose outside the Temple, it may also at times require the will to be coldly andutterly ruthless.Are you Elect or not? If you are, then, in the words of Set spoken at the FirstConclave, “Ye are alien tomankind.”* * * * *- 295 -Reply- by Richard D. Murad II°Scroll of Set #III-8, April 1978I am writing in reference to the article in the February Scroll, “TheImplications of Elitism” by Magister Seago. Ido not agree with everything he said, and what follows are the reasons why.The first matter concerns the statement that “the Temple of Set embodies theonly true religion”. I believe withall my heart and mind that the Temple as it now exists is the most advancedmagical and philosophical order in theworld. As far as I have seen, there is nothing which can compare with the it. Iam very proud to be an Adept withinit. I cannot, however, take it to the point of saying that the Temple embodies“the only true religion”, thusembodying the absolute and ultimate answers to the many philosophical questionswe all have.To say that means that the Temple cannot change any of its current ideas,because if it contains all the truthsnow, any deviation would produce falsehoods. Change is what Xeper is all about.If the religion [I personally preferto employ the word “philosophy”] in the Temple is the ultimate truth, then thesection in the new readinglist “Toward the Unknown Region” means nothing - because if the statement istrue, everything must be known.The philosophy in the Temple today is the most satisfactory for me, because forme it answers questions whichbefore were unanswerable. All my questions can’t be answered, because theTemple, even though the mostadvanced in the world, is not - and by the very nature of the word of the Æoncannot be - a finished product. Thestatement by Magister Seago implies that the philosophy of the current Temple isa finished product. Of course thisfirst matter could be a misinterpretation of Magister Seago’s choice of words onmy part.The second matter concerns Magister Seago’s opinions on dealing with individualsin the mundane world. I donot disagree with him, but I cannot agree without a couple of modifications.I firmly believe that Setians are quite alien to mankind. I also believe that aSetian has the absolute right to useand/or destroy anyone who is capable of being used or destroyed, if it is theSetian’s will to do so. In this sense Ifully agree with him and his four options. However just as it is the right of aSetian to use individuals and if sodesired destroy them, it is also the Setian’s right not to. His articlecompletely overlooks any true friendship or loverelationship which could exist between a Setian and a non-Setian. His articleallows for no possibility of such arelationship.There are those who I would destroy in a minute [and I’m trying]. There are alsothose for whom I would riskmy life. It is my right to act in either manner if I so choose. Of course thissecond matter could be just anothermisinterpretation of Magister Seago’s article.* * * * *Reply to Reply (1)- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #III-9, May 1978It was gratifying to see the concern you expressed in the April XIII Scrollabout my “Implications of Elitism”essay. As it happens your comments are in fact the results of misinterpretation.However if one person has doubts ormisgivings about the essay and has expressed them, the chances are that othershave some which are not beingexpressed. By sending a copy of this letter to the Editor of the Scroll, I mayallay their apprehensions as well as yourown.As I see it, the only thing which can logically be directly inferred fromthe statement that the Temple of Setembodies the only true religion is that the others (conventional religions) arefalse, which is not the same as sayingthat the Temple of Set has all the answers ... or if it is, the connectionescapes me. If I were to extend the syllogismimplicit in your letter a little further, it might look like this:1. The Temple of Set is the only true religion.2. Therefore the philosophy of the current Temple is a complete, finishedproduct which requires nofurther change, modification, or evolution.3. Therefore Xeper, the guiding principle of the Temple (evolutionary change),is false or is impossibleto execute.4. Therefore if the Temple is the true religion, it is necessarily false.I think you can see that the breakdown in logic occurs in the relationshipbetween #1 and #4.The matter of the Temple being “the true religion” [and don’t make the mistakeof applying the conventionalmeaning of “religion” to the Temple’s use of the term; it’s like referring tostage tricks as “magic”] rests upon theanswer to an antecedent question: Is Set a conscious, intelligent, objectiveentity? If you will go back and reread ourintroductory pamphlet, the follow-up document, The Book of Coming Forth by Nightand its Analysis and- 296 -Commentary - especially “GeneSet” - you will find that the Priesthood doesindeed believe that Set is an actualbeing. “All other gods of all other rimes and nations have been created by men.”We are not trying to delude anyone into thinking that we are merely humanists orexistentialists dressed infancy robes who are. developing a philosophy along certain lines because wethink it is “cute”. The Temple of Set isexactly what its name says it is, which should surprise only those who areaccustomed to assuming that everyone is ahypocrite.Back in “the old days” of the Church of Satan, the distinguishing characteristicof the Priesthood was that itsmembers had been “singled out” and “led” through experiences which showed themunequivocally that there was infact a Prince of Darkness. The Priesthood of Set of the year Xlll is a far moresubtle and complex thing than that ofthe year X, but this remains one of its identifying features. Without this“sense of Set”, as Magister Barrett calls it,our Priests would merely be senior magicians and administrators - not Priests.And I will go on record here and nowas stating that if I ever find that an individual holding the III° does notbelieve Set exists, I will (a) counsel thatperson to revert voluntarily to the II° or (b) prosecute his (or her) removalbefore the Council of Nine. This is not tobe construed as punitive: the individual concerned might be a wonderful personand a proficient magician. But not aPriest or Priestess of Set.Things are not so stringent, of course, for the lay membership, and I don’tthink the Temple of Set is “dogmatic”in the usual, repressive sense of the word or that its philosophy isrestrictive. No lay member is required to believe inthe literal existence of Set. Our philosophy is pretty consistent internally,but if that is “restrictive”, then one mightas well condemn a chemist for finding that the results of his experiments tendto support each other.The Word of the Æon is Xeper, but no one is saying that it is necessary to “Saythree Hail Sets and a DiabolusNoster and genuflect” in order to do it; each individual can go about it in hisown way. And while I see tremendousrespect and outright love expressed toward Set within the Temple, I have notnoticed any “bending of knees ordropping of eyes” as occurs in the conventional concept of “worship”.Speaking of respect and love, you stated that my essay “... completely overlooksany true friendship or loverelationship which could exist between a Setian and a non-Setian ... allows forno possibility of such a relationship”.If memory serves me, what I said was: “This does not mean a Setian may not havenon-Elect friends and associates.There is generally some kind of reciprocal benefit in such relationships or theywould not be entered into ...”One such reciprocal benefit, of course, might be affection. That is one of thereasons I have a cat, although I donot think of her as a Setian. I’ve also had a couple of pet humans (female),which worked fine until I began treatingthem as Setians - at which point they became insufferable! Seriously, though, Iknow a number of non-Setianswhose personalities and/or intellectual abilities in various areas draw sincereaffection, admiration, and respectfrom me, and whom I would go pretty far out of my way to help. But as far aspriorities are concerned, Setians havefirst claim on my aid and my friendship.You also pointed out that the Setian has the right not to destroy someone, and Iagree wholeheartedly with that.This recognition is one of the essential differences between the outlook of theAge of Satan and that of the Æon ofSet. The Seventh Satanic Statement proclaims that man is simply a beast who, dueto his mental development, hasbecome more vicious than all the rest. There is a lot to be said for thatstatement. But by virtue of that sameintellectual development - the Gift of Set - man is now able to become somethingother than a beast. He can choosenot to be vicious. Most Setians would probably prefer to follow the “path ofleast resistance” and live asharmoniously with non-Setians as possible. This is why cooperation was the firstof the four options I suggested fordealing with them. The “vicious” options are a last resort.I hope these comments have cleared up your apprehensions about my essay. If not,you are welcome to write tome for further discussion.* * * * *Reply to Reply (2)- by James Lewis III°Scroll of Set #III-9, May 1978After reading Adept Murad’s letter regarding “The Implications of Elitism”, Iwish to toss in two cents’ worth ofmy own view of Magister Seago’s article and Adept Murad’s letter.Agreed, the Temple of Set is the most advanced magical and philosophical orderin the world; no one will arguethis point. But it’s also “the only true religion”. I base this statement on apassage from the Book of Coming Forth byNight: “I am the Ageless Intelligence of this Universe ... All other gods of allother times and nations have beencreated by men.”“All other gods” certainly had greater or lesser followings, but being “createdby men” made them shams, someimpressive and grand, but shams with internal and external control by men. Ifanyone feels this to be the case withthe Temple of Set, I invite a closer inspection. If our By-Laws are notsufficient to stop an individual intent onmanipulating the Temple to his own ends, then Set himself is more than willingand capable to rectify matters.- 297 -Again from my own point of view, the fact that the Temple doesn’t yet have allthe answers doesn’t indicate itisn’t the only true religion. The Elect and the potentially Elect have more ofthe answers than other religioussystems, but these answers lead to more questions which lead to more answers,which ... etc.Adept Murad is quite correct in saying the Temple is not a finished product. Ifour progress thus far is anyindication, then we will have the answers to our present questions. But I mightadd there will be new questions - andall in accordance with the concept of Xeper. So will we ever have all theanswers? Perhaps in the future throughSetamorphosis, but I am no prophet and can only speculate.Finally I cannot agree that Magister Seago’s article overlooks dealings withfriends or loved ones. While therelationship dealings are not expressed openly, there are many implications tohis statement that: “There isgenerally some kind of reciprocal benefit in such relationships, or they wouldnot be entered into. The non-Setianmay be entertaining and amusing, possess some skill which you can learn orpersuade him to employ on yourbehalf, etc.” I feel it’s the latter half of this quote which may make thearticle seem cold to some; I’d point out thatthese examples are by no means the only benefits obtained from relationshipswith non-Setians. As I said, there aremany implications in the first half of the quote.I for one am glad Adept Murad expressed his opinion in the Scroll. I know itmade me think, and I’m sure it hasdone so for others.- 298 -A37: By Any Other Name- by Alexandra Sarris (NebXet) III° and Linda Parrinello [Reynolds] (Medu nXensu) III°Scroll of Set #III-7, March 1978That the symbolic value of names has been used as an element in initiation isattested in countlessinscriptions. Even the names of things bear witness to the constant solicitudeto establish a relation betweenthe thing and its essential quality or its function ...The name was held to be a definition of the essential nature of the individualand the plan of hisdevelopment. That is why one person could receive several names according to thestages of his evolution.- Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, Her-BakThe Anubis Pylon in San Francisco celebrated the arrival of year XIII by hostinga New Year’s Eve feast andritual. Attending were the eight Anubians and five other Setian guests. Duringthe post-ritual discussion, the subjectof magical names arose. From the comments received, it became evident to us thatwe were involved in certainmagical developments that our guests found extremely interesting and that wewould like to share with you.There has been a tradition among witch doctors, shamans, and magicians to haveboth a public and a secret,personal name. These people believed that knowledge of their secret names wouldmake them vulnerable to theirenemies. Thus they were carefully guarded by those magicians.In the Church of Satan initiates chose names for themselves to represent theirdesired path of development.They focused energy toward the evocation of the qualities they felt these namesrepresented. In the Temple of Setthere is no specific policy for the acquisition of a magical name. Some Setianshave chosen their names according tothe Church of Satan guidelines. However we of the Anubis Pylon have discoveredour magical entities in anotherway. While we have found that there is no timetable for receiving a magicalname, for us it has occurred at a pointwhen we were becoming attuned to our selves and each other during ritual.Within a month’s time five Anubians perceived their magical selves in the formof names. We did not choosethese names! [Interestingly these entities which became manifest were Egyptian.]Here is an example: one member considered herself to be somewhat powerlessthough actually she was not.Fittingly the entity who came to her was an Egyptian being who exemplified power- a being who recognized thatthis aspiring magician needed to evolve toward a perception of her own power. Inthis very same way we receivedthe magical names of entities befitting our evolutionary needs.Who are these entities? Are they telesmic images? Are they merely manifestationsof our imagination? Are theyexisting beings with whom we are interreacting?We believe they are the latter, though we cannot substantiate our reasons forthis belief. We have only ourimpressions and perceptions to support our conclusions. We believe these beingshave existed for thousands ofyears and have passed out of consciousness until now. They have re-emerged asthey recognized those Setiansevolving to the point where their (the entities’) particular attributes wereappropriately suited. However the entitycannot “connect” with the Setian until an evolutionary level has been attainedallowing both to become magicallyattuned. The entity recognizes the needs of the Setian that must be met in orderto continue toward Setamorphosis.At this point you may be thinking that we are creating telesmic images tocounteract the flaws that we see inourselves. We do not believe this to be true, because the entity in eachinstance has appeared before the individualhad any knowledge of the qualities attributable to that entity! For the samereason they cannot be manifestations ofthe imagination, for often the Setian had little or no knowledge of Egyptology .We do, however, consider that these entities may be telesmic images created bythe ancient Egyptians, or theessence of pre-existing beings.Magister Barrett has described the magical entity acquired by the Setian as “youahead of yourself”. As we havesaid, the magical entity embodies those qualities to which we aspire. As weevolve through ritual experiences, so dowe evolve toward the actualization of our magical selves. As our introductorynote states, as a Setian grows, he canreceive his name according to his evolution. [It is not inconceivable that amagical entity might choose to identifywith more than one Setian.] Once the qualities of the magical entity have beenrealized, the Setian may begin a newcycle of development with an entirely new being. It becomes tremendouslyapparent when the existing name hasbecome obsolete.We (the authors) perceived our magical names last winter (XI). By mid-October(XII) we both recognized thatthese names and all they represented were no longer viable for us. [They may beperfectly adequate for otherevolving Setians to whom the qualities would apply.]During a ritual on October 21st, our new entities made themselves dramatically -and simultaneously -apparent. It is significant that though we had obviously become linked with thenew entities, we had no idea of theireventual state of being. Only recently have meaningful aspects revealedthemselves. At present we are aware of thefact that our prior entities seem to have been one-dimensional, with limitedfunction. Our new entities are far morecomplex and are gradually becoming defined in many dimensions.- 299 -Consider the possible benefits. The magical self can in effect provide anevolutionary “short-cut”. Yourassociation will be a constant source of stimuli; it is a tool to otherdimensions that you need only employ. Whenbringing these entities to the fore, we experience an enhanced awareness of truemagic. These beings seem toillustrate hidden aspects of our selves that we are either unaware of or do notparticularly want exposed. What betterway to overcome negative energies? The solution to a problem lies in clearlydefining the problem!From the text of this article, you can see that there are many questions stillunanswered, though we have statedour beliefs and illustrated our experiences in this matter. Where do you feelthe magical entity comes from? Is theentity directed to us by Set? Are the entities indeed individual, or are theyvarious aspects of the complex Set-entity?Do they exist with him in his dimension? Consider some of these questions andperhaps offer your own insights,comments, and experiences which will benefit us and all Setians.[Note: This article is a discussion by the authors alone, though some of theideas expressed are shared by all ofAnubis Pylon. Her-Bak is a beautiful book which illustrates in a clear andthought-provoking way an aspect ofancient Egyptian philosophical thought. It presents Egyptian life in regard tothe search for understanding theintrinsic essence of the name. It reveals the belief of a “lesson in everyfeature”. From its author’s introduction: “Inevery instance these concrete images serve to teach abstract principles hiddenwithin, which in turn reveal universallaws.” We highly recommend that you read it!]- 300 -A38: From Thoughts to Words, or To Define- by Ricco A. Zappitelli III°Scroll of Set #III-9, May 1978I have written this article in an all-consuming drive to make my feelings beunderstood and felt. I’ll try to speakof these feelings as clearly and precisely as possible. For all of you out therewhom I have never personally met, I askyou to hear the “heart” of my words.I notice that of late there seem to be letters, statements, and opinions comingfrom I° and II°, all questioningdifferent basic concepts [which in itself is a commendable thing]. But afterviewing them from a high enoughperspective, I have begun to see an alarming pattern developing.This pattern seems to revolve around religion and its various connotations. I amnot a trained psychiatrist norpsychologist, but I do not totally understand why “problems” should arise withno apparent reason. I offer thefollowing thoughts, words, or definitions to get us closer to working outsolutions.First of all, as the Temple of Set, what are we? Let’s define: As anorganization, I feel we are (1) religious, (2)philosophical, and (3) a magical temple.What does this all really mean? First, the Temple of Set is a religion. There,I’ve said it. I for one am not afraidof that word; rather I will define it:A religion may be to others a principle of worship [which it is most definitelynot to me!], or it can be a definite,all-consuming, all-pervading knowing or belief in a form, principle, or entity.It is this definition of the knowledgeand belief in the existence of Set to be real, that I speak of when I speak ofmy “religion”.From this belief springs my concept of a way of living and viewing life, and soemerges the next aspect, my“philosophy”.And finally the third and most vital force binding the other two elementstogether is our magical existence andlife which bridge the gates of the physical and metaphysical and allow us tobreak natural order and rise high abovelower man’s definitions of religion, philosophy, etc. Cf. Ouspensky’s theory asdefined in The Psychology of Man’sPossible Evolution.By now you’re probably asking, “What is this madman talking about anyway?” I’lltell you why I clearly definewhat I feel to be our Temple’s three aspects with such deliberation: namely thepattern I see evolving - or rather “de-evolving” - here concerning the concept of religion and whether Set is or is notreal.I can only say to those who are confused or in doubt on this matter, “Go back tothe basics.” Re-read theinformational letter that you received upon entry, re-read other printedmaterial, including the most important [inmy opinion] Book of Coming Forth by Night, in which Set speaks to us: “I thinknot of those who think not of me.”One must be or exist in order to do so; this is the very basis of our Temple:not worship, but belief that Set does infact exist. Again from the Book of Coming Forth by Night I quote: “Speak ratherto me as a friend, gently andwithout fear, and I shall hear as a friend. Do not bend your knee nor drop youreye, for such things were not done inmy house at PaMat-et.”To endorse our religious, philosophical, magical Temple of Set means that one infact does know that theexistence of Set is valid. To do otherwise is in my opinion quite illogical.Now to my next feeling: It has been too long since I have seen questions andfeedback aired in the Scroll of Set.We need this, and I for one heartily encourage more of it. To stifle one’sthoughts or feelings is definitely not whatthe Temple of Set is about.I feel as a Priest of Set that honoring the dignity of all Setians, regardlessof degree, is vital if we are to continueto Xeper to a “higher” state. Lower thoughts and mundane, petty ways cannot be.I ask that the followingconsiderations be thought of before composing a rebuttal [as once proposed byour High Priest for answeringquestions, challenges, or disputable statements, especially those of a volatilenature]:(1) Put the material in question aside for a few days.(2) Later reread the material and redefine it.(3) Try looking at it from a higher perspective and from the other fellow’spossible point of view.These three steps I have used and find helpful, since being basically of anemotional, rash temperament, I mighteasily tend to “jump the gun”, “climb a tree”, or be misunderstood. All I canadd to this is to ask that we as Setiansalways keep uppermost in our mind what we are and remember that dignity andrespect must be afforded us all.I suggest further that whenever we challenge, question, or dispute, it behandled with the aforementionedqualities in mind. To do otherwise, or to challenge in an accusing or arroganttone is a thing that can easily be donewithout full awareness. This we as Setians cannot allow to happen.As one is Recognized as passing into a higher degree, one must also understandthat perceptions also change,thus “verbiage” doesn’t mean the same thing and more than oft needs redefining.If a I° or II° fully understood allthe implications from a III° perception, for example, he would be of thatdegree. This is what any school of magicalinitiation is about. There were many times, for example, at my I° and II° levelwhen all I could simply do was “trust”the higher degrees’ conceptions and perceptions above me. I can look back andtruly say that in no instance was I- 301 -misled or un-answered. Upon Becoming III° I can now and only now begin tounderstand and appreciate themagical system.In conclusion, I would also suggest that we think beyond simple questioning(gently, with our opinions) whilealways thinking of constructive ends towards our and thus our Temple’s goals. Ifor one will honor questions,statements, or disagreements stated to me in an inquiring form in a respectfulmanner - but will disregard and ill-dignify any written word or thought that tries to demean my thought or dignity,and will expect the same of all otherSetians.On to the questions raised in reference to the February Scroll’s article byMagister Dale Seago, “Implications ofElitism.”The first concern over Magister Seago’s statement that the Temple of Setembodies the only true religion, I donot dispute. However I can see how questions may arise on this matter. On thefollowing line, however, I feel heclears this up. I quote, “It seems to me that this should be clarified. If thisorganization is in fact the Temple of Set,then ours is the true religion.” I feel he means this from the precision of hiswords.We are not an absolute and complete religion or philosophy. To make thisstatement would be to dispute ourWord Xeper and concept of this Æon. I feel Magister Seago no more means thatthan to state we are the only formof a religion today. Rather I feel he means “absolute” from a higher, purer form- from an original or pure source,namely ancient Xem/PaMat-et. Definitely this does not mean absolute in the“completed” sense. All otherspringboard spin-offs, for example the Osirian cult, Judeo/Christianity, etc.,are superficial imitations and in thatsense not true.How to deal with non-Setians? Again I agree with Seago’s statements. It was goodto finally see things I have feltin my own dealings with “humans” put down in such an explicit manner, However Ido feel the key is that he statesthese as some of the options. Since very few things in our life are “absolutes”,I agree it all ends up with theindividual Setian. When we write an article, answer a letter, etc., we usuallystate our opinions and perceivedtruths, and only infrequently absolute truth!So I see no real disagreement, but only a misinterpretation of the term“absolute”, with consideration to themore rarefied perspective of a Magister.I hope l have shed some light on these topics for all Setians [I have for myselfupon introspection!] and inviteany feedback.- 302 -A39: Problems of Perception- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #III-10, June 1978In a recent personal letter to me, Priest James Lewis remarked:Excuse me, but damn it, Ethel was sneaky as a snake when he came out with theone about Set“becoming a god like unto the others”. That has caused more upset than anythingI’ve seen yet, and the oddpart is that somehow the alleged change from Set-being to “Jehovah” escapes mecompletely. Either I’m toosmart to be taken in by it or too stupid to notice it - I like to think it’s theformer.Since this rather bewildering accusation was first made, a most interestingthing has happened: severalmembers of the Temple of Set have resigned, giving as their primary excuse theallegation that the Temple has“become” a religion [as though it had not been one from the beginning]. Onewould almost think they had neverread our introductory material.It is tempting to explain all this away by saying that a Master of the Templerenounced his Mastery and elevatedsomeone to the Priesthood on other-than-III° criteria, who then wrongly elevatedAdepts, all of which led to a bigmess.At the political (organizational) level of analysis, this appears to be true;but it is still an incomplete explanation.The recent resignation letters of Richard Murad and Howard Sinnott have promptedme to explore this entiresituation in greater depth from magical and philosophical perspectives. As aresult I believe I have been able toidentify the major factors involved.Historically the roots appear to lie in the Church of Satan and conflictresulting from “inner” and “outer”teachings. At the level of the public and the general membership, the Prince ofDarkness was seen as a metaphor - asis explained in the Satanic Bible.The “inner circle” of the Elect, however - known as the Order of the Trapezoidand comprising most of thePriesthood - was engaged in the study and application of “higher Satanicmetaphysics”; and for them, as well as forAnton LaVey as head of the Order, the Prince of Darkness was a very real entityindeed.This was not communicated to the general membership, since a qualification foradmission into that Order wasan independent realization of the reality behind the fantasy. The Church ofSatan, in other words, attempted tohave its cake and eat it too by appealing to both a popular movement and aninner elite. The conflicts thisengendered were the subject of innumerable letters between Anton LaVey andMichael Aquino, many of which Ihave read.When the Temple of Set Came into Being it was decided, in accordance with theBook of Coming Forth byNight, that it would be an elitist order and that the “inner” teachings would bemade accessible to anyone with thecapacity to comprehend and apply them. Those who could not do so had no businessbeing here. The C/S degreesystem had been breaking down, however, and many of the C/S degree transfers hadto be accepted “on faith” in aneffort to be fair to all concerned. The assumption was that any imprecise degreedesignations would sooner or laterbecome apparent.Many of the persons who transferred to the Temple may have failed [or simplyrefused] to perceive that theTemple leadership was speaking not allegorically but literally, and they mayalso have taught the old general-C/S-symbolic approach to newcomers with whom they came in contact.Given the open accessibility of our philosophy and our Priesthood, I can onlyconclude that there was a refusalto perceive. And when finally pushed to the wall and forced to realize that weactually meant what we were saying,they would naturally accuse the Temple of Set of having “become” a religionbecause they had never opened theireyes and seen the Temple before. [Yet Ethel’s “Word” is “Perceive”. Ratherironic!]There is also an inherent difficulty in the language we are forced to employ. Inthe late 1940s, after an eight-yearstudy of the ancient temple complex at Luxor, alchemist R.A. Schwaller de Lubiczwrote that:The pharaonic mentality is typically indirect. A defined form is used to evokethe idea of this form - thatis to say, the abstract complex that presides over this defined form. - TheTemple in ManAnd so it is in our Temple as well. We are speaking literally, but we areobliged to use conventional language andconceptual terminology in an effort to at least approximately communicate ourdiscoveries and ideas. But theinfluence of our typically-Western logical, “linear” type of thinking is suchthat it creates the tendency to mistake ourdefined forms, which are merely shadows, for the actual Forms or Realities whichlie behind and cast thoseshadows.Thus when I say that Set exists and is an actual, objective entity, some membersmight think at first of thepicture on the introductory pamphlet of the Infernal Anteater sitting on athrone. But what I mean is a good dealmore complex than that.- 303 -Richard Murad was apparently under the impression that any philosophy is asvalid as any other (whichultimately makes all philosophies meaningless), and rejected ours because hedidn’t like it anymore. In a letter toPriest Lewis announcing his resignation, he said:Jim, I do not believe in philosophical absolutes. I feel that man has, andalways will create his owntruths. None of them are right, and none of them are wrong. Different ones arejust that, different.Murad obviously just hasn’t done his homework. The primary contention of thePlatonic dialogues is that whatPlato refers to as the “Forms”, such as “Virtue”, “Justice”, “Truth”, “theGood”, etc. [all of which are aspects of agreater Form, Principle, or neter which the Egyptians called Maat], do have anactual existence, a greater reality ofwhich our concepts are only a shadow-play ... and that one can approach anincreasingly-clear perception andunderstanding of the Forms through the philosophical discipline.But Plato also recognizes and demonstrates that the logical, “linear” method ofanalysis is not sufficient in itselfto accomplish this. Thus arises the need for some means of direct apprehensionand experience of the neteru orForms.And this is where the working of magic comes into play in the Temple of Set. Itis essentially a non-rational,non-linear sort of process which is complementary to the linear mode. For thetransformation ( Xeper) of theindividual into a higher being capable of understanding, perceiving, andexperiencing Set (the neter of non-natural,separate intellectual identity), both methods are essential and balance eachother. Neither is complete without theother; they are inextricably intertwined.This leads me to what I believe is the most important factor in the recentresignations: the failure of members todo their homework. Many people try to follow the philosophy without actuallyexperimenting with magic. Thus theylack any real experiential understanding and are “armchair magicians” who aremerely juggling theories.Others take this imbalance even further and attempt to simply “parrot” thingsthey hear without delving deeper.At the II° level, for example, a comprehensive reading list is available throughthe Ruby Tablet of Set. One or morebooks in most categories are coded “RL1”. There is a reason for this. Thereading of those books is required in orderfor the new Adept to be able to begin to really understand what this “thing ofours” is all about.How many of you Adepts have read them? If you were to enroll in a degree programin any university and refuseto purchase the required course texts, you would be hopelessly lost by the thirdlecture. The magical andphilosophical curriculum of the Temple of Set is every bit as demanding, and inmany ways it is far more difficult.The Temple of Set is not for people who simply want to wear pretty medallionsand attend fancy ceremonies. Itis for people who want to learn to strengthen and utilize their individualWills, and who aspire to the knowledge andunderstanding which we of the Priesthood possess and are developing.However our initiatory system is a highly selective process which imposes greatstress upon the intellectual andmagical faculties of the individual, Many initiates are unable to withstandthese pressures. Those who cannot will,sooner or later, weed themselves out. That this has been occurring lately is nocause for alarm. It is as much a sign ofthe success of our system as is the Coming into Being of a new Priest orPriestess.Nor should it come as any surprise that those who are resigning are attemptingto rationalize their unfitness,lack of effort, and inability to Xeper any further. No one is likely to feelpsychologically comfortable facing himself inthe mirror and thinking, “I’m a ‘deficient intellectual’ who couldn’t make it,freaked out, and went back to being anerd.”This, I think, is another reason for the otherwise-bewildering accusationsleveled at the Temple of Set by Ethel,Holt, and their cronies. The real irony in all this is that Ethel’s intent wastreacherous, dishonorable, despicable, andutterly vile ... and yet, in the end, he is doing us a greater service than hecan imagine - by collecting our garbage.For those of you who are tempted to conclude that the Priesthood feels that theTemple of Set exists for it aloneand that the lay degrees can sink or swim, let me say this: If your motives aresincere - if you want to grow, develop,Xeper [whether you aspire to the Priesthood or not] - we are here to help you,and we love you. But the impetus, theinitiative to develop and to work, must come from you.May the Infernal Anteater be with you.* * * * *Answer to a Letter Concerning my “Problems of Perception”- by L. Dale Seago IV°Scroll of Set #III-12, August 1978Thank you for responding to my article in the June Scroll. Your letter brings upa few points which I feel shouldbe addressed in some detail.As it happens, I do remember corresponding with you when I was a corporal in theMarine Corps, shortly beforeI left North Carolina. I was not aware until now, however, that you had joinedthe Temple of Set at the time it Cameinto Being. I had not heard from you for quite a long time, and I did notrecognize your name when I saw it on the- 304 -computer printouts. And that fact leads me to a question: You stated that in theTemple “everyone seemed to beinvolved” and that you were “used to the opposite”. Why didn’t you becomeinvolved, instead of remaining just aname in a data bank?Your comments about not being able to afford books on magic even after all theseyears strike me as a littlestrange. The real problem appears to me to be one of priorities, of which thingsin your life are the most importantto you. Even on my enlisted military salary, I was able to set aside a littlefor books. If you were to save a couple ofdollars a week [and most people spend at least that much just on junk food andbeer], you would be able to buyabout a dozen books a year. If that is somehow just not possible, you areprobably within a reasonable distance of apublic or college library. If you do not own your own transportation or areunable to drive to a library, check out thelocal bus lines.You state that you never changed your fortunes [and therefore still cannotafford books], and again I have toask: Why? At the inception of the Æon of Set, I was laid off from my job and wasunemployed for about six months;but I drew up a plan of action, stuck with it, and made it work. I came to SantaBarbara two and a half years ago withan old car, some clothes, eighty dollars, a kitten, no job, and no place tolive. I found a place to stay until I couldimprove my position and joined the Army Reserve to supplement my unemploymentchecks. Then I was hired as abank teller, enrolled in some evening college courses, and after half a year ofthat got into the University ofCalifornia and its Army ROTC program while continuing to work part-time for thebank. I have just recentlyreceived a degree in political science and have been commissioned a SecondLieutenant in Military Intelligence, andI will be working in the field of strategic Psychological Operations for theArmy while continuing to work for thebank while pursuing a graduate degree. And I haven’t exactly been inactive inthe Temple, either.All this I have accomplished through my own efforts, with the inspiration andguidance of Set and a lot of veryhard work - because it was my will to Become, and I applied my will. It can bedone.Your equation of the term “elitism” with being “well to do” has nothing to dowith the way I have always appliedit in my writings. In an article I wrote in January of this year for a nationalmagazine, I said:Esoteric orders have generally been successful as esoteric orders to the extentthat they haveincorporated such Black elements as elitism [in the sense of genuine rather thanpresumed intellectualsuperiority], individualism, and personal responsibility.Intellectual superiority does not necessarily have any relationship to one’soccupation or income. When I speakof elitism, I am speaking of elite minds, not jobs. A self-educated philosophernamed Eric Hoffer, who is widelyrespected in sociological circles and has written some superbly-insightfulbooks, has for many years made his livingas a longshoreman on the San Francisco shipping docks because he likes that kindof work. And the same situationcan exist in the Temple of Set.As I pointed out in my article, “The impetus, the initiative to develop and towork, must come from you.” TheTemple accepts I° members as students and apprentices, which is what that degreeis all about. It is not theresponsibility of the teacher to run after his students, requesting theirpermission to “lay the wisdom of the Æonupon them”. Quite the contrary. It is up to the students to ask questions, makean effort to grasp what is beingtaught, and apply it in their lives ... which means a lot of work. If thestudents will not do this, then they have onlythemselves to blame when they “flunk out”.You mention, finally, that the Prince of Darkness seems to you to be “quiteindifferent to anything”. There maybe a reason for this. In fact I think it is stated quite clearly in the Book ofComing Forth by Night: “And I think notof those who think not of me.” What have you been doing to deserve hisattention? From my own experience andthat of many others, he seems to take a very personal interest in his Elect whogenuinely seek him. But it appears tome from all available indications that, frankly, you don’t give a damn.- 305 -A40: The Third Year- by Michael A. Aquino V°, High Priest of SetScroll of Set #III-11, July 1978On each anniversary of the founding of the Temple of Set, I have prepared areport for the Scroll summarizingthe past year’s developments and outlining some prospects for the future. Duringthe first two years of the Æon, itseemed that these reports could be justifiably positive. Everyone appeared to beenjoying the Temple, contributingto its overall creativity, and cooperating in a spirit of friendship, trust, andmutual respect.As it turned out, however, our utopian expectations were a bit premature. Thispast year the momentum of theTemple was interrupted by two unfortunate incidents.In November our first Executive Director, Priest William F. Murray, experiencedan emotional and physicalbreakdown, necessitating his resignation from office, retirement from thePriesthood, and convalescence undermedical supervision.Twenty-four hours after Murray’s breakdown, Magister Robert Ethel, Chairman ofthe Council of Nine, resignedfrom the Temple to form an organization of his own. After trying unsuccessfullyto get me to turn my back on the I°/II° Initiates and Priesthood of the Temple and cooperate with him, Ethelsuddenly reversed himself. He leveledcharges of corruption at me, sneered at the Temple and Priesthood whose care andguardianship he had acceptedonly four months earlier [upon reappointment to the Council Chairmanship], andendeavored to lure personalfriends into his new group with promises of higher titles than they had beenable to attain within the Temple.Ultimately two Priests - Roland Holt and Howard Sinnott - opted to follow Ethel,as did about six or seven I°/II°Setians who believed his accusations. A few other Temple Initiates, presumablydismayed by the very fact of thecrisis, have since resigned from the Temple without affirming a position one wayor the other.In terms of numbers the schism affected the Temple very little, but the Templehas never measured itself interms of numbers. Psychologically the damage was serious. The reputations of thePriesthood, the Masters of theTemple, and the Council as groups of high integrity and impeccable motives wereshaken. My own ethics andcredentials as High Priest of Set and a Magus V° were attacked not partially,but with venom as sudden as it wasextreme.It would have been a farcical situation save for Ethel’s high degree and office,and for the unfamiliarity of manyof our newer Initiates with the actual facts. In the resulting confusion theCouncil and I were forced to state, restate,and document the truth to such an extent that many of our other projects andresponsibilities came virtually to astandstill for the ensuing eight months. At this writing I think we’ve cleanedup the bulk of the damage and deceitattempted by Ethel and Holt, although I understand a few more Setians are stillbeing propagandized.Why did something like this happen to the Temple? More importantly, what can welearn from it to prevent orat least minimize similar problems in the future? Dr. F.I. Regardie commented tome that schisms born of ego-inflation are an almost inescapable feature of magical orders. He has witnessedmany others in his time,commencing with the breakup of the Golden Dawn at the turn of this century.Let me begin by recalling the experience of the Church of Satan. As it began togrow beyond the scope of a SanFrancisco organization, it too encountered revolts and attempted schisms. Atfirst Anton LaVey rode through theseas fairly as he could. But, as there seemed to be no end to the incidents, hegrew increasingly cynical anddisillusioned, first about the integrity of the C/S as an organization and thenabout the sanctity of the degree system.He spoke more and more about the necessity to evaluate Satanism as a “movement”,not as an institution, and of thefailure of the degree-system to draw meaningful distinctions among individuals.To make it more difficult for incidents to spread beyond a local level, Antonseverely curtailed conclaves, inter-member communications, and local/regional publications. Finally, in May of X, hedecided to exploit the degree-system for purposes of financial and material profit.It was at this point that those Satanists who believed in the authenticity andsanctity of the C/S and the degree-system resigned to form a “Second Church of Satan” which, after the NorthSolstice X, came into being as theTemple of Set.At one point during the XII-XIII crisis, Ethel argued that what he was doing wasessentially no different from“what I had done to Anton LaVey in 1975”.Strictly speaking, however, Ethel had come full circle back to Anton’s positionthat the organization was non-productive and the degree-system meaningless. Whereas Anton had determined toreap practical benefits from hisconclusion, however, Ethel opted to attempt a new organization and degree-systembased not upon a recognizedMandate from the Prince of Darkness, but rather upon Ethel’s self-proclaimedconcepts of what they should be.From a conceptual standpoint, this is the basic distinction between the Templeof Set and Ethel’s Order of theInverse Pentagram (O.I.P.): Ethel bases his claim to the title of Magus and theinspiration for the O.I.P. solely uponhis own ideas while I understand the degree-system, including the V°, asauthenticated and sanctified by a higherintellectual presence: Set, the Prince of Darkness. Accordingly I understand myfunction as a Magus to be that of anagency through which a magical principle ( Xeper) is defined and explained bythe Will of Set. I further presumethat the Temple, like the Golden Dawn, A.’.A.’., and Church of Satan before it,is the embodiment of a Mandategreater than simply the collective desires of its Initiates. It is preciselywhat its name implies: the Temple of Set.- 306 -This distinction makes it far easier for Ethel to explain the O.I.P. than for aPriest of Set to explain the Temple ofSet, since Ethel is dealing with a known quantity while the Temple is dealingwith many concepts so overwhelmingthat we can only approach them by induction and approximation.The O.I.P. is nothing more than a social club for materialists who enjoyceremonial pageantry, and this factbespeaks the ultimate futility of its posture: If it remains true to itsproclaimed atheism, then its priesthoods, rituals,and mysteries are just so much play-acting. But if it attempts to introduce anysort of external authentication into itspractices, the O.I.P. betrays its origin as nothing more than a cold-bloodedattempt to exploit Murray’s illness, theclimate of trust and open communication within the Temple of Set, and Ethel’shigh office in order to cripple andsupplant the Temple with an authoritarian dictatorship.These are strong words, and I use them deliberately, because I want you to seebehind the rhetoric to just wasreally at stake. When the final crisis in the Church of Satan arose, there wasno way for the institution to be saved indefiance of Anton LaVey, because he maintained absolute legal, financial, andorganizational control of it.When I drafted the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for the Temple in Julyof X, therefore, I determined todesign an institution so open and so counterbalanced that misuse of it foranyone’s personal aggrandizementwould be virtually impossible.Accordingly organizational power was carefully divided between the Council ofNine, the High Priest, and theExecutive Director via an interlocking system of checks and balances. All fundshave been kept in corporate savingsand checking accounts requiring multiple signatures for transaction, and thelegalizing of the Temple as a Californianon-profit corporation was accomplished to make it just that much more difficultfor someone to abuse it or exploitit. [Complete sets of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are provided toevery III°, and every Setian iswelcome to view them.] Finally since our inception we have endeavored tomaintain a climate of openness and trustthat would inhibit cliques and predatory factions from gaining a foothold.The effectiveness of these various safeguards can be seen, I think, both in theway in which the Ethel schismdeveloped and in the operational profile of the Temple itself during and afterthe crisis. Although he was Chairmanof the Council, a position with, among other things, the power to remove acorrupt High Priest from office, Ethelcould not have established credibility for false charges among a majority of theNine [who would have had toconfirm any such action of his by vote]. Hence the Chairman’s office, althoughpowerful enough to protect theTemple against an incompetent/megalomaniac High Priest, is useless as a platformfrom which to stage a “palacerevolt”.Ethel’s only option was to disassociate himself completely from the checks andbalances of the Templestructure, placing himself in a position in which he would be responsible onlyto himself. And that is what he did.Although he announced that his O.I.P. would be governed by a council, it wouldbe as toothless as the old Church ofSatan Council of Nine - at most a group of favored advisors who would have noinstitutional or legal power tochallenge or overrule Ethel’s desires.Because the Temple By-Laws specify procedures for the replacement of allofficials, designation of a newChairman of the Council and Executive Director was orderly and systematic. Thenew Chairman was nominated byme per recommendations from the Councillors and then confirmed by formal vote ofthe Council. The newExecutive Director was nominated by the Chairman and again confirmed by Councilvote.Had such procedures not existed, and had the Priesthood not determined to applythem constructively,efficiently, and responsibly, it is possible that the Temple might have brokenapart under the shocks that it received.Not only has it survived, however, but it has come through the ordeal with agreater sense of its own strength andcharacter than had been apparent in the days when no such obstacles had beenencountered.The materialist/atheist alternative that had been presented and the criticismsthat had been raised concerningthe religious philosophy of the Temple also forced Setians of all degrees toreexamine their positions.Some, who decided that they could not understand the propositions for theexistence of Set or who grosslymisunderstood the essence of that entity, but who enjoyed the pageantry ofoccultism, opted for Ethel’s O.I.P.Others left altogether. But still others, whether by reason or sensation or acombination of the two, came to therealization that there was indeed an essence of the Temple and the Æon that wasunique and authentic. They notonly admit to being Setians; they take so profound a pride in that affirmationthat it transforms their entire mode ofexistence. They look at the past, the present, and the future with an insightand an understanding that, if not yetsupernatural, are at nature’s intellectual extremes. And they are determined toexpand and ultimately transcendthose extremes to experience the phenomenon of Setamorphosis.We have learned the hard way that the pains we took to protect the Templeagainst abuse by cliques orindividuals were justified. We had the machinery to deal with suchcontingencies; the Golden Dawn, the A.’.A.’., andthe C/S did not. They came to an end, and we survive. “Those who do not studyhistory are condemned to relive it.”We have also learned the hard way that the Temple cannot make silk purses out ofsows’ ears. Persons who donot possess the qualities characteristic of the Elect cannot be taught them. Norcan persons who reject the exerciseof those qualities be “rescued”, no matter what degree they have attained. Wemust content ourselves withrecognizing those who appear to be Elect, then providing them with the contactsand research assists to develop andencourage their potential.- 307 -If one chooses to experiment with atomic energy, one must risk atomicexplosions. And if the Temple proposesto unleash dormant powers of the will, it must risk explosions of that powerwhich accidentally or deliberately injureit. There is no alternative.Consequently suggestions that the channels of information and communication inthe Temple be morerestrictive to lessen the chances of future Ethel-revolts cannot be accepted. Wewould then be following the path ofthe Church of Satan making our existence more comfortable at the expense of ourtrue reason for existing at all. Wemust understand this now, and we must remember it in the future.Moreover crises of this sort are not merely instructive for the damage that theycause. The history of the Templesuggests that we are prone to critical episodes which test the evolutionarystamina of the institution and its Initiates:“Seldon crises” (as defined in Asimov’s Foundation trilogy ... on our readinglist).The resolution of a Seldon crisis does not return everything to status quo.Rather it functions as a sort ofevolutionary dialectic: The clash of a thesis (the pre-existing situation) andan antithesis (the crisis) results in asynthesis (a more advanced mode of existence). We can see this process veryclearly in the present case, as theTemple is far more precise now both intellectually and magically than it was ayear ago. So while our “normal”projects may have been stopped in their tracks for eight months, the GreatProject has taken quite a leap forward.Now that the dust has cleared, we are in a position to bring our “normal”projects up to par. Later this summerthe first edition of the Crystal Tablet of Set, an introductory document writtenfor the I°, will be published.Originally designed to provide more sophisticated coverage of the same basicconcepts addressed in the SatanicBible, it has evolved into a text that is both more specific in what it doescover and more responsible in terms of itsacademic source.Unlike the Satanic Bible it does not attempt to generalize the entire sweep ofour philosophy. Rather it isdesigned to be the first in many linked stages of magical and philosophicaldoctrines presented to Setians. Editorand author of the CT is Magister L. Dale Seago, who has devoted much of his timeduring the past year researching,writing, and editing the document for release. Like other Temple publications itwill be a “living” work, structuredfor efficient and economical revision as the process of Xeper continues.Expect to see some revisions, expansions, and additions to the Ruby Tablet ofSet. Glinda and I are at workupon one rather ambitious contribution right now, and others (such as someconjectures, shall we say, concerningChambers’ The King in Yellow) are pending. Many of you have mentioned RT draftsyou’re preparing as well. Thereading list, victim of two drastic overhauls since it first appeared, willprobably undergo still another updating [andfattening]. And who knows? There may be still other RT-related surprises instore - perhaps sooner than you think.I have asked Magistra Wendall and Priest Waters to prepare, as their timepermits, a general topical index to theScroll of Set to date, so that the publication’s encyclopedic value will beenhanced. An enormous amount of thesubstantive research conducted by Setians since the year X has appeared in thisperiodical, and its intellectual depthis far greater than that of any other publication of an “occult” orientation.Any Setian who does not have thecomplete set of Scrolls to date should make it a point to acquire them, and allSetians who have them shouldoccasionally review them for the many fresh insights they offer into theunfolding of the Æon. [I am surprised athow many bits of information I may miss at a first reading.]You have heard me emphasize the importance of the Scroll before, not as a meansfor the proclamation ofdogma but as a forum in which Setians from all parts of the globe may addressthe entire membership on mattersimportant to them and to the Temple as a whole. If we are determined to have andto sustain a Fellowship thatspans vast reaches of geography, rather than a varying number ofpurely-localized groups with only a vague sense ofthe entire Temple, we must not only read the Scroll; we must speak through it toone another. [At the SanFrancisco Conclave Priest Waters asked me if I would contribute a regular columnto each new issue after this one,and I agreed. But such contributions of mine will be kept as succinct aspossible, so that all of you will havemaximum access to the newsletter.]Conclaves too will receive fresh emphasis during this next year. There neverseem to be enough of them to meetthe enthusiasm sparked by them! In addition to local and regional gatherings, wehope to schedule the first trulyTemple-wide Conclave since our founding, for the summer of XIV in Detroit. Asmuch as we may endeavor to bridgethe distances separating us with letters, calls, and publications, there arestill so many factors in philosophicaldialogue, magical workings, and personal relationships that cannot survivewithout first-hand contact.As our scope of operation continues to grow, we will proceed with theintegration of electronic data-processinginto both our administrative and our creative operations. At present [and forthe last three years] our entiremembership and Scroll mailing records have been handled by computer. And inaddition to Glinda (whom you metin the November XII Scroll), there are now microcomputers at work in bothMagister Grumboski’s data-processingheadquarters and in the office of the Executive Director. Eventually we plan todevelop interfaces for these, so thatvast quantities of data may travel across the Temple almost instantaneously. Youwill probably see one of thesecomputers handling registration/scheduling/locating at the National Conclave.And the day may not be far off when every Priest of Set and to some extent everySetian will be able to obtainboth research material and single or group communications links simply bydialing a telephone number and placingthe receiver in a standard, personal-sized terminal the size of a portabletypewriter or television set. At that timeprinted documents and newsletters may become archaic, as would many letters of aroutine nature. Not as fantastica scenario as you might think.- 308 -On an interpersonal level the Executive Director, with the aid ofdata-processing, has just completed a projectmatching every Initiate of the Temple with at least two or three contacts of ahigher degree, so that no one need feelout-of-touch or awkward about initiating dialogue. Again we feel that this isall the more important because of therelative isolation of many of our Initiates. Reports that have come in to dateindicate that everyone seems to like thenew idea.And so we commence our fourth year of Coming Into Being. As I look back at thefirst three, I see far morereasons to be satisfied with what we’ve accomplished than reasons to regret thejolts we’ve occasionally experienced.As Priest Tom Huddleston once so aptly remarked, “no one said this thing wasgoing to be easy”. As we go at it withgreater energy, coordination, and awareness, it’s going to get tougher. Andthere will be more Seldon crises, too, Isuspect, if only to keep us on our toes when we think that we’ve finally thoughtof everything!When I began this report, I wondered whether I should make you any promisesconcerning the future of thisÆon, which always seems so irritatingly open-ended. About the only thing I cancome up with is a guarantee of lackof boredom. [Unless, as Ken Kesey used to say, you decide to get “off the bus”.]It is a future to be determined notjust by you as a person, but by That within you which is [or may be] Elect.A short time ago I saw the motion picture Damien: Omen II. And I had somethingof a surprise, because theactor playing the young Antichrist is virtually a mirror-image of me as I was atthat age [although he lacks myinfamous eyebrows]. As I watched his bewilderment upon realizing his identity, Ifelt again the shock of the NorthSolstice X and the conviction that has continued to grow in me since thatmoment.How foolish they were, those horror-stricken Christians who collected the fablesof the “Book of Revelation”!What would a true Antichrist want with world domination if those under his swaywere no more than the semi-beasts they now are? He would merely be one more Alexander, one more Cæsar, onemore Bonaparte.No, the strength of the Æon which has now been unleashed lies in its promise tofree the Elect among mankindonce and for all from the great patterns of animalistic conceptualization andbehavior in which they have beenimprisoned for so many thousands of years: to take that realization of True Willas proclaimed by the Beast 666 andforce it into an independent focus of identity and creative power through theprinciple of Xeper.Without this ambition the Temple, as colorful and stimulating as it might be,would be inauthentic. With it, andwith the collective will of the Elect in support of it, we are indeed authenticso much so that no one else on this worldcan begin to understand how or why this is so.And therefore, terrified, confused, and suspicious as they are, they arearrogant enough to caricature a Magus asa mere negation of their own demagogue an “Antichrist” and to think that hisweapons would be terror, murder, anddomination by force! Jesus Christ is irrelevant to this Æon, as are all otherswho champion the return of mankind tothe iron grip of the Natural mechanism. And the power of a true Magus lies notin the tools of a Cæsar or a Napoleonbut in a Word: Xeper.- 309 -A41: Book Review - Earthsea Trilogy- by Robert Menschel II°Scroll of Set #IV-1, September 1978A Wizard of Earthsea (#T2168), The Tombs of Atuan (#T8318), and The EarthestShore (#T2126), by Ursula K.LeGuin, Bantam Books, N.Y.This trilogy is a wonderful adventure story. It is a biography of Sparrowhawk(whose true name is Ged), fromhis earliest demonstration of magical potential through his final adventure asArchmage of Earthsea. It is veryenjoyable reading. It is also magically quite intriguing. It poses many magicalquestions and theories.Sparrowhawk has begun his apprenticeship to Osion, master Wizard. Unknown to hismaster, Sparrowhawkopens a book of rituals and reads one. He becomes trapped by the ritual, whichseems to summon a frighteningshadow from the underworld. Osion returns to banish the shadow, and has thesewords for his pupil: “Have younever thought how danger must surround power as shadow does light? ... Think ofthis: that every word, every act ofour Art, is said and is done either for good, or for evil. Before you speak ordo you must know the price that is topay!”Setian philosophy agrees that magic is dangerous, Magicians havecreated/summoned beings with the power todestroy their creator/ summoner, probably due to guilt, and certainly due to thelack of a consciously directed andfocused will. Even a Setian must recognize the dangers of magic [See MagisterSeago’s “Psychic Hazards and ProperUse of Ritual Magic” in the Ruby Tablet].Good and evil are not so well recognized among Setians [see “Sainthood vs.Sethood”, Scroll, September XII].However we should try to avoid acts which cause effect contrary to our desires,and should perform those acts whichwill accomplish our goals.We should not become paralyzed into inactivity by fear of the unknown effects ofour actions. We should,however, conscientiously examine all acts, magical and mundane, for their likelyeffects.Each of us has a responsibility to examine each of our acts, to determine theirprobable effects. We should act asour will, backed by intelligent consideration, dictates. We should not reactwith emotional whim.In Earthsea the over-exertion of magical muscles can be physically harmful.Sparrowhawk’s first magical featwas to cloak his village in fog during an invasion, foiling the invaders. Afterthe fog dissipated, “No weapon-hurt hadcome to the boy, but he would not speak nor eat nor sleep ... His aunt said, ‘Hehas overspent his power.’” Itrequired Master Wizard Osion to bring Sparrowhawk back to life.After a short apprenticeship with Osion, Sparrowhawk enrolled in the School ofWizardry at Roke. He proved tobe an exceptional student, combining his natural magical talent with a talentfor study. During a battle of pride withanother student, Sparrowhawk summoned a beautiful princess from the dead. Healso accidentally summoned anevil spirit from the Unknown, a demon dedicated to destroying Sparrowhawk.Only the swift action of the Archmage of Roke saves Sparrowhawk and drives awaythe demon. The Archmagethen strains all his power to close the gate between Earthsea and the Unknown.Ged was put to bed, and his physicalwounds cared for, but:Not far away, in the unroofed court where the fountain played, the Archmage layalso unmoving, butcold, very cold: only his eyes lived, watching the fall of moonlit water and thestir of moonlit leaves. Thosewith him said no spells and worked no healing ... To check the ungoverned spelland drive off the shadowfrom Ged, Nemmerle had spent all his power, and with it his bodily strength wasgone, He lay dying ...We must know who we are; we must know what we are. Just as we recognize theunlimited power we may Xeperto, we must recognize the relatively limited power we currently have. This isthe concept of balance as expressed inthe Satanic Bible.Sparrowhawk spends over a year recovering from the attack. He finally meets thenew Archmage, who has thesewords:You have great power inborn in you, and you used that power wrongly, to work aspell over which youhad no control, not knowing how that spell affects the balance of light anddark, life and death, good andevil. And you were moved to do this by pride and by hate. Is it any wonder theresult was ruin?When do we act willfully, and when do we act emotionally? Humans arerationalizing creatures. We must everexamine our intentions to determine if we are rationally following our will, orrationalizingly following ouremotions. The latter can act in opposition to our goals.After Ged earns his wizard’s staff, he leaves Roke and has several adventures,running from the demon. Gedeventually turns and boots the demon. Several more adventures are in the offing,until Ged finally catches up withthe demon in the uncharted ocean surrounding Earthsea.Ged overcomes the demon by naming the demon with his own name, recognizing thedemon as himself, as thedemon within which must be recognized to be defeated. These were a wizardfriend’s observations:- 310 -And he began to see the truth, that Ged had neither lost nor won but, naming theshadow of his deathwith his own name, had made himself whole: a man: who, knowing his whole trueself, cannot be used orpossessed by any power other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived forlife’s sake and never in theservice of pain, or hatred, or the dark.Each of us must know ourself. In Earthsea this is an exceptional quality whichGed attains: being whole,knowing himself. Because of it he is more powerful, more magically balanced.As Setians, knowing ourselves is essential. Even as Set created HarWer so thatSet could define himself, so mustwe determine what we are and what we are not. We must know ourselves and bewhole; only thus can we willfullyXeper.One of Sparrowhawk’s earlier lessons:“You want to work spells,” Osion said presently, striding along. “You’ve drawntoo much water fromthat well. Wait. Manhood is patience. Mastery is nine times patience. What isthat herb by the path?”“Strawflower.”“And that?”“I don’t know.”“Fourfoil, they call it.” Osion had halted, the coppershod foot of his staffnear the little weed, so Gedlooked closely at the plant, and plucked a dry seedpod from it, and finallyasked, since Osion said nothingmore, “What is its use, Master?”“None I know of.”Ged kept the seedpod a while as they went on, then tossed it away.“When you know the fourfoil in all its seasons, root and leaf and flower, bysight and scent and seed,then you may learn its true name, knowing its being: which is more than its use.What, after all, is the use ofyou? Or of myself? Is Gont Mountain useful, or the Open Sea?” Osion went on ahalf mile or so, and said atlast, “To hear, one must be silent.”Ged himself later explained the subject thusly:“Do you see, Arren, how an act is not, as young men think, like a rock that onepicks up and throws, andit hits or misses, and that’s the end of it. When that rock is lifted, the Earthis lighter; the hand that bears itheavier, When it is thrown, the circuits of the stars respond, and where itstrikes or falls the universe ischanged. On every act the balance of the whole depends, The winds and seas, thepowers of water and earthand light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, iswell done, and rightly done, Allthese act within the Equilibrium. From the hurricane and the great whale’ssounding to the fall of a dry leafand the gnat’s flight, all they do is done within the balance of the whole. Butwe, insofar as we have powerover the world and over one another, we must learn to do what the leaf and thewhale and the wind do oftheir own nature. We must learn to keep the balance. Having intelligence, wemust not act in ignorance.Having choice, we must not act without responsibility ...”“But then,” the boy said, frowning at the stars, “is the balance to be kept bydoing nothing? Surely aman must act, even not knowing all the consequences of his act, if anything isto be done at all?”“Never fear. It is much easier for men to act than to refrain from acting. Wewill continue to do goodand to do evil ... But if there were a king over us all again, and he soughtcounsel of a mage, as in the days ofold, and I were that mage, I would say to him: ‘My lord, do nothing because itis righteous to praiseworthyor noble to do so; do nothing because it seems good to do so; do only that whichyou must do and which youcannot do in any other way.’”Just as we act in our own best interests, we need to be patient enough to gatherthe data required for the logicaland willful analysis of our acts, their causes, and results. We must be patientenough to not be misled into error.“Can it be a kind of pestilence, a plague, that drifts from land to land,blighting the crops and the flocksand men’s spirits?”For when it rained Osion would not even say the spell that every weatherworkerknows, to send thestorm aside. In a land where sorcerers come thick, like Gont or the Enlades, youmay see a raincloudblundering slowly from side to side and place to place as one spell shunts itonto the next, till at last it isbuffeted out over the sea where it can rain in peace. But Osion let the rainfall where it would. He found athick fir-tree and lay down beneath it. Ged crouched among the dripping busheswet and sullen, andwondered what was the good of having power if you were too wise to use it, andwished he had gone asprentice to that old weatherworker of the Vale, where at least he would havekept dry.Which is the true knowledge? Xeper is not the only choice. Is it the best? Eachof us must continually decide.Why do I, a Setian, worry about such things as these? I do so because I am aSetian, a willful being.- 311 -Nature acts in equilibrium with itself. All natural acts are just that: natural.Men, however, have the power toside-step nature, to upset nature’s equilibrium.Many willful acts (magical or otherwise) are not of global importance. Some,however, upset nature’sequilibrium such that there is a natural backlash, which may interferetemporarily with our goals. [One suchbacklash is the ever-increasing pollution caused by our unnatural but oftendesirable industries. Another might bethe drought affecting the southwest.]Even fewer are the acts so disastrous as to need to be countered by anotherwillful act. One such would be a verypowerful psychic “sniper”, who would locate and destroy individuals of Setianoutlook and power. Another might bea mad president [of any country], intent on using the Bomb.In Ged’s final and greatest adventure:“A pestilence is a motion of the great Balance, of the Equilibrium itself; thisis different ... This is not arighting of the balance, but an upsetting of it. There is only one creature whocan do that.”“A man?” Arren said, tentative.“We men.”“How?”“By an unmeasured desire for life.”“For life? But it isn’t wrong to want to live?”“No. But when we crave power over life endless wealth, unassailable safety,immortality then desirebecomes greed. And if knowledge allies itself to that greed, then comes evil.Then the balance of the world isswayed, and ruin weighs heavy in the scale.”Arren brooded over this a while and said at last, “Then you think it is a man weseek?”“A man, and a mage. Aye, I think so.”“But I had thought, from what my father and teachers taught, that the great artsof wizardry weredependent on the Balance, the Equilibrium of things, and so could not beused-for evil.”“That,” said Sparrowhawk somewhat wryly, “is a debatable point. Infinite are thearguments of mages ...Every land of Earthsea knows of witches who cast unclean spells, sorcerers whouse their art to win riches.But there is more. The Firelord, who sought to undo the darkness and stop thesun at noon, was a greatmage; even Erreth-Akbe could scarcely defeat him. The Enemy of Morred wasanother such. Where hecame, whole cities knelt to him; armies fought for him. The spell he woveagainst Morred was so mighty thateven when he was slain it could not be halted, and the island of Solea wasoverwhelmed by the sea, and allon it perished. These were men in whom great strength and knowledge served thewill to evil and fed uponit. Whether the wizardry that serves a better end may always prove the stronger,we do not know. We hope.”- 312 -A42: From Psychology to Philosophy, or Know Thyself- by Ricco A. Zappitelli III°Scroll of Set #IV-2, October 1978In Egypt and ancient Greece psychology [defined by Webster’s as “the sciencedealing with the mind and mentaland emotional processes”] originally existed in a form known as the Mysteries,but later split into severalfragmented forms, among them alchemy, magic, masonry, occultism, and Theosophy.The important thing to note from this historical information was that theancient form of the study of man’sbehavior was reduced from the “all-encompassing” school of Mysteries tospecialized parts, making comprehensionof the whole almost an impossibility.Today the two systems of psychology as they exist are (1) the study of man as heis imagined or thought to be - asystem based upon man’s being asleep, and (2) the study of man from the point ofview of his possible evolution - asystem based on man’s awakening.An acceptance of the former system (placing rest and preservation as ultimategoals) can only bring aboutstagnation, whereas pursuance of the latter (placing change and creating aboveall, or Xeper) is our concern.I give to you my great pentagram ... and it is shown inverse that creation andchange be exalted aboverest and preservation.The first step toward this evolution must be brought about by efforts of acontrolled kind in an observantstate. The other factors which are vital toward this growth are a “learning” ofcertain techniques and/or knowledgeof methods, and secondly help by interacting with others. [Ouspensky definesthis as a “school”.] This I feel is oneof the most valuable functions of the Temple of Set and its pylons - to afford avehicle to aid towards the individual’stotal possible expansion toward the goal of Xeper. I can’t help but feel withoutthis “school” our individualevolution, [and thus the Temple’s evolution] would be slower and more arduous tobring about.There are several reasons I can see why we could be obstructed from furthergrowth. They might be:(1) On true introspection the “cost” of advancement in clarifying our lifestyleswould be considered toogreat and thus dispensed with.(2) Because we wouldn’t have a strong enough desire to evolve, or thepersistence to struggle toward thatend for a prolonged-enough length of time. Desire and duration are vital inseeking evolution!(3) Because of our inability or failure to comprehend or even understand thetheory of futuredevelopment, even if it were explained in detail.(4) Last and most importantly [described by Ouspensky as the “missing link”] toovercome our inability toadmit to ourselves that the qualities we ascribe as already having in fact existonly as potentials orfuture possibilities which we can only attain by work.These factors, I feel upon self-observation, apply to all degrees of Setians invarying levels and ways and can aidus all toward Xeper. After coming to terms with ourselves, as it were, anddeciding we in fact do want this evolution,the magician must (1) develop the dormant powers he presently considers himselfas already having to their fullestpotential, then (2) work on developing these powers further to the point ofacquiring new facilities and powerswhich presently they don’t possess and under “normal” circumstances could neverhave, and finally (3) elevate theself to the “all-encompassing” prospective of “higher man” or, as defined by thephilosophy of Nietzsche, the“superman”.This concept of higher self is an important step I feel toward our progress ofSetamorphosis to be attainedthrough higher consciousness.What exactly is consciousness?Such easy questions I’m frequently asked! But seriously how does one definethat?All that I could start with was what consciousness was generally thought to be,namely the equivalent of mind-activity when in fact it is a particular kind of awareness independent of themind’s activity, brought about byobservation of self: who I am, where I am, and what I do not in fact know. Ofcourse this conscious state orawakened state would be improved as we know by duration and frequency. Mypersonal difficulty, however, seemsto arise in the combating of what Ouspensky calls the “four harmful functions”.I have to struggle daily against these to remain aware of them and overcomethem. If you’re anything like meand not yet perfect, you might want to reflect on them. They are (1) Lying knownor unknown (Know Thyself); (2)Imagination - imagining things without seeing them objectively as they reallyare; (3) Any negative expressions;(4) Unnecessary, unclear talking - not thought out.- 313 -From this study on psychology and our inner workings must necessarily develop aphilosophy (or life and worldview) of our own. In Before Philosophy before man’s way of life was formed intoa pattern which could be looselytermed philosophy, he based his view on his mythology and religion.We now have, along with this Gift of Set, a valuable vehicle which enables us tobring all things together, as wasdone in ancient times in their life style, namely our Temple. It affords us awork-ground for expanding magicalprinciples - a “school”, religion, philosophy, psychology, and a research areafor survival techniques, to mention afew.I as a Priest of Set invite you also to join me on this magnificent venture- the undertaking of attaining our“impossible possibilities”.- 314 -A43: Maat- by Alexandra Sarris III°Scroll of Set #IV-2, October 1978Think this well over. Nothing can be assimilated to Maat that is not of Maat’snature, true andindestructible consciousness. All that comes of the lower personality, all thatis mortal, fictitious, cerebral,alien to he individual’s essential being, is rejected. - Isha Schwaller deLubicz, Her-BakWhat does the word “Maat” evoke? A woman with a feather on her head? An Egyptiangoddess standing besidea scale? Budge will tell you that Maat is the Egyptian symbol of Justice andTruth. Her feather of Truth is weighedagainst a deceased one’s heart to see how the deceased was in life. Should thescales tip, the deceased would bedevoured by a frightful beast that stands beside the throne of Osiris. Thatseems to be Maat’s primary function.The above definition of Maat is adequate - just. I would like to give youanother perspective. Budge describes afunction - what she does, not what she is.Consider Maat in this way. Yes, she stands for Truth and Justice, and yet Maatis more. She is not onlyrepresentative of the principles - the neteru - she embraces them collectively.She may be considered the glue thatholds the whole Egyptian pantheon, civilization and essence together. Maat isthe Egyptian symbol for a way ofliving, of being. The Egyptians had two phrases pertinent to Maat: anX m Ma’atand ma’a heru (”to live in Truth”and “true of voice”).A person living in Maat was not merely truthful or just; he conducted his lifewith a sense of Truth and Justice.His life was Maat. He was Being Maat within himself. And when he spoke, hiswords were True; he was ma’a heru.[Note the capitalized words, particularly “true” and “True.”]Maat’s feather is very light compared to the heart it judges. If you have beentrapped in the mundane, theintellectual, the day-to-day, you have not recognized or lived in Maat, and yourheart will tip the scales. But if youhave begun to Xeper, to seek your higher, unified self, you will also have begunto live your life in the glow ofabsolutes - Truth/Justice, Maat - in particular.Truth is a principle - one of the Platonic absolutes. We cannot measure or evendefine it; we can only usesymbols to “define” with it. Xeper is not exclusive of Maat; with Xeper comesMaat, for as we evolve, we becomemore and more able to understand our selves. “Maat is in Truth the highestconsciousness man can make his own.”Let me give you a concrete example: You hear a statement and its accuracy isimmediately and compellinglyapparent. “That’s true!” you say, and you know that it is so.Other times you hear a statement and agree with it or disagree with it on anintellectual basis. The first time youglimpsed Maat because you were attuning to your self. The second time youdidn’t.Maat is very pervasive; if you Xeper, you can’t avoid facing her; if you don’t,you won’t know you’re missinganything. More importantly, as you do Xeper, you will find yourself weighingyour self against Maat repeatedly asyou grow - not at the judgment scene at the end, for we are not [presumably]going to end as the humans in themundane world. The rules for us are different.Maat was the principle governing the Old Kingdom. Everyone lived in Maat; andPharaoh was the embodimenton Earth of that principle. By the time of the New Kingdom (the Empire, Tut,etc.), this understanding had becomelost [except perhaps to the few] and the words merely empty formulæ. Budge’sdefinition of Maat comes from thatlatter period. However for this new Æon, for the new being, we must see the fardeeper and significant being ofMaat.Maat is the way we conduct our lives. Do we live and act and be in Truth, or dowe just think so, deluding ourselves? We may speak “truth” one time and not at other times. Yet perhaps it isonly important to speak “Truth”when necessary. We all speak “truth” or “truths” in our daily lives, and even inour private Setian lives.But do we speak “Truth”? Little-“t” truth is pretty easy to manage; but big“T”-Truth is something else. “Truth”does not originate in the mundane self, but rather in the deepest part of ourselves, in what I have called the CoreSelf. As we become more in tune with this Core, we can perceive Truth as it is,not as we conceive it. As we Become,as we see and utter Truth, we move toward that true Egyptian concept of Maat -living our selves and our lives inTruth. We may still utter “truth” in our mundane lives, but we can also see“Truth” as it is in our selves and inothers’. We begin to function as Maat, for as we hear words - ours and others’ -we weigh them on the scales of Truthand judge them.Justice, the other word linked with Maat, is inherent in Truth, for withoutTruth, Justice would be mocked.With Truth, Justice exists. As we weigh the words on the scales for Truth, weare also seeking Justice there - notjurisprudence, but Justice the principle.Why devote all this time to Maat? It has become obvious that many Setians thinkof Maat as a woman with afeather in her hair who weighs people’s hearts for “truth.” Living in Maat mustbe living and breathing Truth -particularly as Setians, and particularly in the ritual chamber. For here, morethan anywhere else, before Set, wemust face our selves and judge our selves as being ma’a heru or not. Do weperceive and utter “Truth” or merely“truth”? Set does not need to tell us; we look inside our selves and see. Andevery time we can examine our heartsand say, “Yes, I spoke Truth, or I saw Truth,” we are one step closer to a Truesense of Maat.- 315 -A44: Nature/ Neter- by Linda Reynolds III°Scroll of Set #IV-3, November 1978In view of Priestess Alexandra Sarris’ article on Maat ( Scroll, October XIII),it seems appropriate and timely forsome concepts I wish to explore.Maat, the principle of Truth, her feather symbolic of a True and Just state ofbeing, personifies for me that oft-mentioned phrase, “them ‘n’ us”. Maat outlines in glaring brilliance theincredible contrast between thosesometimes cruel and unjust, occasionally bearable, but always predictablecreatures of the natural order: humanity.As you will all attest to, our experiences and contacts with humanity-at-largecan hardly be classified as eitherhelpful, positive, or as an advancement of this Æon. But I didn’t intend this tobe a critique of humanity’s mistakes.Rather I’m attempting to draw a parallel between the ancient Egyptian concept ofthe neter (pronounced “netcher”)and the all-inclusive concept of nature as defined by modern scientific types.There is an obvious “them ‘n’ us” quality here, and I am hoping to clarify itfor myself as well as my readers.Looking back to Priestess Sarris’ article “The Integral Self” ( Scroll, FebruaryXIII) and using the following quotefrom Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate, I can see a correlation between our selves, ourmagical essence and what it iscomposed of, and the neter-concept versus the natural order, human nature andwhat it is not composed of.First re-read the Maat article and particularly the quote which accompanies it.Then the following:They did establish a direct connection between natural phenomena and theprincipal functions, orneters. There is not a single “natural” phenomenon that may not be attributed tothe action of the neters.And from another page:The Egyptian teaching relies on the symbol in nature; its way of action is theprojection of heaven uponearth, of the metaphysical world into the physical world, and of cosmic causalfunctions into the humanbody.“Higher man”, the “Core Self”, is obviously being described. The Egyptiansseemed to feel that once you hadperceived the neter within yourself, the “causal function”, you had indeedreached a higher state of being, if onlyin the sense that you reached an understanding of why things occurred as theydid. It was a basic metaphysicalunderstanding at best, but they certainly were on the right track.The correlation that I see occurring now has its basis in my conviction that therecognition, the perception, andadoption of those same neters as part of a Setian’s nature leads not only to anunderstanding of the principle butto the actual “becoming” of, and unification with that principle.For example, if a Setian consistently practices truth in his life and recognizesit in himself, he becomes Truth. Inthe “doing” you create the “being”. And once that particular neter has becomemanifest within your very being, nolonger can it be “switched off” or ignored except by an actively negative forceof will: a backward step which couldcause a chain-reaction of negation leading the once-evolving Magician intoessential oblivion.The Black Magus need fear no power save his own, but he must conquer his ownWill [nature?] that hecause not his destruction through ill chance or purpose. - from the Statement ofBelial, The DiaboliconWhat I am presenting is actually another interpretation of the Xeper-process,but perhaps with a somewhatdifferent slant. We have heard Xeper defined as evolvement, growth toward ...but I am offering other words suchas “re-creating and re-recognizing” those ancient and ageless principles calledneters by the Egyptians; re-recognizing them in and as our selves, thereby creating that which is both ourunbroken [though sometimes time-shrouded] link with an ancient past, and an undeniable goal as well. The entireformula, viewed as a continuous,though for ages dormant process, rings of the kind of timelessness which theBlack Magician can appreciate.Well! That’s my perception about “us”, much ritualized over and intellectuallybombarded by that “nature-minded” human in me!As far as “they” are concerned, it’s a much easier concept to swallow. You haveheard the phrase: “That’s thenature of things.” Doesn’t that sound like the typical human concession to fate,hopelessness in the hands of anomnipotent, omnipresent God, etc? If “Heaven must perish; Hell must perish ...”,then what will remain? Nature?Neter? The answer seems clear, as is the course our lives must take. Think andlive and be in and of Maat, and youshall discover [or re-discover] and reunite with those principal elements, theneters, by which your essence can andmust be defined.- 316 -A45: Biography - Magistra Lilith Sinclair- by Constance Moffatt II°Scroll of Set #IV-6, February 1979She walks in beauty, like the night -Of cloudless climes and starry skies;And all that’s best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes.- George Gordon, Lord ByronShe walks in beauty, because she is beauty - dark, radiant, queenly, vital - agoddess!Magistra Lilith Sinclair was born, raised, and educated in a Roman Catholicatmosphere in Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania. After two years in Doylestown, she moved to Spotswood, New Jerseywith her two children, BethAmber and Christopher Martin, where she remained for five years. Her lastresidence in the east was Jersey City.During her time in New Jersey, she modeled for a year in New York City andsecured a position as secretary toco-owners of “The Magician”, a totally Black Arts-oriented shop in Manhattan.Gradually she became manager ofthe store as she moved up from retail selling to wholesale buying and operatingthe mail order accounts. One of theowners was Ronald K. Barrett, then a Warlock II° of the Church of Satan.Questions, contradictions, and discrepancies concerning her religious teachingsstarted plaguing her during herhigh school years. Her brain ran rampant trying to find answers that never came.The nuns could not quell herquestioning mind. Thus by the end of high school she was an agnostic. As shesought out other religions, she foundhypocrisies, restrictions, repressions. Within 3-5 years she became an atheist.During all of this time, Magistra Sinclair found herself fascinated withwitchcraft and magic. As she read booksand viewed movies on the subject, she realized that her fascination lay with theDark Side and self-accomplishmentas opposed to the White Side with its altruistic goals. One of her fellowworkers, knowing of her interests, boughther a copy of the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey. Until that time she had nevereven heard of the Church of Satan. Asshe read and re-read the book, she was overwhelmed by seeing in print thephilosophies she had been feeling for somany years. It was as though LaVey had known her thoughts while writing hisbook. She immediately wrote to theC/S to learn more about it. She took several months to decide to join becauseshe wanted it to be a serious decision.In 1970 Magistra Sinclair was accepted to the C/S and was put in communicationwith individual members inthe northeast. After six months she felt the need to work actively with a group.Consequently her own Lilith Grottocame into existence. The first meeting in Spotswood consisted of herself and twostrangers. In two years the Grottogrew to 50 members in three states, and remained at that strength for the nextthree years. Eventually the Grottobranched off into three independent groups in New York, New Jersey, andPennsylvania.Much of the success of the Lilith Grotto was due to Magistra Sinclair’s impactin radio, television, andnewspaper interviews. Over the years she was also an invited lecturer at suchlocales as Boston University, QueensCollege, Columbia University, local N.Y.C. public and parochial high schools,the Philadelphia Ethical Society, andthe Psychic Phenomenon Society. The last saw her speaking before several hundredpeople as she shared the daiswith Jean Dixon and Hans Holzer. This was her last public speaking engagementbefore heading west.By this time Magistra Sinclair had built such a reputation as to be known as the“Occult Superstar of the EastCoast” ( Philadelphia magazine article). Unfortunately this fame and flamboyancyhad their bad effects - the loss oftwo jobs, harassment, vandalism of her home - particularly after a Time magazineinterview.After a year as a Satanist I° in the C/S, Magistra Sinclair took and passed herWitch II° test. Six months later shewas asked to accompany Anton LaVey on an eastern publicity tour promoting hisnew book The Compleat Witch. Ashe was leaving N.Y.C., he told her to take her test for Priestess III°, whichshe passed in April 1972. She was formallyordained by C/S Priest Michael Grumboski at the Third Eastern Conclave at theManhattan Statler Hilton inOctober of the same year.Santa Barbara became this vivacious lady’s abode in October 1974. Within thefirst month after the Temple ofSet came into being, Magus Aquino Recognized Lilith Sinclair as Magistra TemplilV°.During her C/S days she had searched through the list of “Infernal names” in theSatanic Bible for a magicalname. She liked the sound of “Lilith” and by instinct selected it. Herinvestigation of the chosen name followed. Herritual name, which she uses only in workings when she wants to evoke the Cobragoddess with whom she identifies,is Uræus, the Serpent One.Along with her 13-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, she lives with aSiamese/Persian black cat with goldeneyes named Seti. She works for a stock brokerage firm. Her parents and brother,Adept William Butch, still reside inPittsburgh.Magistra Sinclair counts among her important interests astronomy and geology,which she has studied at SantaBarbara City College. She also is proficient at belly dancing, which she doessolely for physical fitness and self-enjoyment. An avid reader, she also likes instrumental music, particularlyclassical. The Moody Blues and JeffersonStarship are her very favorite modern performers.- 317 -A woman of keen insight and sharp intellect, she prefers talking to writing andis very eloquent at it. She likes adegree of formality with people when she first meets them. Above all she abhorsanyone calling her “Lil”. She alsohas little patience with non-Setians who ask obviously inane, pointlessquestions regarding the Black Arts andSetian philosophy, since they evidence a sensational, rather than a genuineinterest. On the other hand, serious,intelligent questions are met with frank, thoughtful answers and a receptiveear.More than the ocean, which she loves, she is drawn to dense, enveloping fog,particularly on a grey, lonely,morning, beach stroll where she can hear the crashing waves as she wraps herselfin a mystical, magical cloak ofmist and senses her awareness of what she has become in her own universe.Magistra Sinclair would like to develop herself to the highest degree ofintellectual and magical end she canachieve. She does not know if there is a limit to this as she continues toXeper. Ultimately she desires to be powerful,proficient, highly-evolved, skilled sorceress that she can - “to dare the BlackMagic” and succeed.- 318 -A46: It is Now the Time for the Coming Into Being of Xem- by Constance Moffatt II°Scroll of Set #IV-9, May 1979The “Infernal Mandate” is carried by whoever best represents the true will ofthe Prince of Darkness at agiven point of time. I am convinced that the “Infernal Mandate” has now passed.Xeper has been Uttered,and it is now the time for the Coming Into Being of Xem. The impetus of the Æonof Set is now in the care ofanother Magus. - Michael A. Aquino V°Thus did Magus Ronald Keith Barrett Come Into Being as the new High Priest ofthe Temple of Set on March24th of the year XIV Æon of Set.Magus Barrett, known magically as Anubis, entered this world in the small townof Fort Branch, Indiana,September 29, 1944 CE.One of three sons of members of the Presbyterian Church, Anubis was elected tothe Indiana State Synod, thegoverning body of the Presbyterian Church, when he was 14 years of age. Afterchallenging the hypocrisies of thechurch and incurring the wrath of the religious fathers, he resigned from boththe Synod and the church.Anubis nevertheless continued in his search to find the true church - one thatpracticed what it preached. “Myquest for that God that called to me from the time I was a young boy drove me[and everyone else, I might add]crazy. I was labelled ‘fanatic’ and ‘heretic’ at the same time.”Anubis spent most of his time in the local cemetery outside of Fort Branch, orperformed contrived rituals infront of the altar of the town’s Presbyterian Church, the sanctuary to which hegained access by sneaking in throughunlocked windows.The special ceremonies of the Mormon Church and the secrecy of their templeappealed to Anubis. At 17 hethought he wanted to “try it out”. When his parents prevented his baptism, hejoined the Army in order to have thefreedom to join the church. By this time, however, he began to question andchallenge the Christian god. “I reasonedthat maybe he was wrong if all his followers were such hypocrites. Then I made abargain with both the Devil andGod at the same time. The one who could prove himself to me would gain myloyalty. Religion became empty to me,and I became something of a rebel.”Shortly thereafter Anubis decided to investigate certain magazine ads and joinedAMORC. This association wasnot long-lived.During the 1962-65 Army years which followed high school graduation, he had somemedical training. Shortly"},{"pageContent":"after his Army hitch was up, Anubis joined the Universe Book Club. His firstorder included The Black Arts byCavendish and Diary of a Witch by Sybil Leek.Something in me said, “Yeah, more, more!”. My very first ritual was my ownversion of a destruction ritual, andit really worked.Disenchantment soon set in, however, as he became bogged down with worthlessoccult books. Thedisenchantment led to “internal outrage toward everything”. He bought amotorcycle, became involved with anoutlaw club, cultivated a “very demonic appearance, and generally raised Hell”.One day a mysterious package arrived in the mail, sender unknown. It containedAnton LaVey’s Satanic Bible.“I laughed and put it away for a rainy day. Then one day it rained!” Anubis readthe book in one sitting and finishedby proclaiming himself a Satanist. “I felt as if LaVey had written my ownfeelings and ideas in his book.” Shortlythereafter he wrote the Church of Satan for an application.Anubis became a Satanist I° in V AS. He continued on through the Church,becoming a Warlock II° in VII. Hejoined the Lilith Grotto and the Grotto Council in VII in New York City, wherehe owned and operated “TheMagician”, an occult service/store specializing in Satanic ritual supplies,books, occult jewelry, metaphysical artgallery, etc. He formed the Twilight Grotto, the last Grotto in the Church ofSatan, in IX.The Temple of Set welcomed Anubis as a Priest of Set III° in July of X ÆS. Hebecame one of the originalCouncil of Nine the same year. During this time he brought into creation theAnubis Pylon in San Francisco, whichwas active through the Vernal Equinox XIII. He became a Magister Templi IV° inAugust of XII, and Chairman ofthe Council of Nine in January XIII. He was Recognized as a Magus V° on theSouth Solstice XIII.Magus Barrett moved to Potter Valley, approximately 180 miles north of SanFrancisco, early in XIII. Shortlyafterward he made his final move to the top of his three-mile-high, magicalmountain of mystic origins and wild,primitive beauty, which he named XemSet. Wilderness is sone thing which he hasalways loved, and this extremelyremote mountain more or less “found me. It is the magically correct place for meto be. I feel uncompromised hereat XemSet. This is also where I first ‘knew’ my Word Xem.” Since that first dayof residency on Middle Mountain, hehas worked tirelessly building the XemSet complex, an extensive undertaking.Dark and Handsome, with a rather disarming, jackal-like smile, Anubis likes topaint, sculpt, explore, and“terrorize humans”, the last of which he lists first among his pet peeves. He isalso interested in metaphysics,electronic & classical music, science fiction, philosophy, Egyptian language,religion, magic, Lovecraft, other horrorliterature, and art.- 319 -This very magnetic and energetic Magus likes coffee, his pipe, a full Moon,summer, peanut butter, Grape-Nuts,creating things, watching nature as he works outdoors, magical work, Setiancompany & magical discussions, and“me”. He has left cities, loud noise, sports, pollution, and humans - all ofwhich he abhors - behind him. More ofhis pet peeves are: cold, wet weather; helplessness; sloppiness; senselessred-tape rules and laws; mechanicalfailure; soul music; imbalance; illness; intellectual snobs; drunks & “heads”;liars & thieves; incompetence; and“situations affecting me that I cannot control”.Merenthoth, the XemSet cat, will be joined in August by a pet wolf, who will fitquite well into the surroundinganimal life of deer, jack rabbits, raccoons, owls, and snakes.Magus Barrett fully identifies with the Temple of Set because as one of theElect he knows that the Temple “isthat one organization on Earth dedicated to Truth. The Temple is that whichgives means and/or purpose toeverything else. It is the vehicle of the Elect upon the path of Xeper to Xem.”As Magus, Anubis desires to define and completely “Open the Way to Xem”; as HighPriest of Set, he hopes to“guide and protect the Temple as best I can”. Personally he aspires to “fullyCome Into Being as a god”.I would like to recognize and thank Anton LaVey, who helped to set me on thepath of magic, andMagistra Lilith Sinclair, who was a true teacher and guide for me. Without herexample and magicalexpertise, I would not be who and what I am today. And finally I wish to thankand express my love andrespect to Magus Michael Aquino, without whom none of us would be who and whatwe are. There is nonegreater than this one. He is honored by me above all others, not only for whathe has done, but for who hehas shown us that he is. It is my will and my Word that he shall always behonored among us.As Magus Ronald K. Barrett, High Priest of the Temple of Set, advises allSetians to “never be less than you are”,he also leaves us with his favorite quote from The Morning of the Magicians:“Freedom to become in the midst of aneternity which is!”- 320 -A47: The Xem Working- by Ronald K. Barrett III°June 22, XII/1977 (on XemSet)Working question: About the mountain (Khemset) “complex,” my strange thoughts,and the development ofself.The area in which I had chosen to work was also near the site I had beenpreparing for my future home. Therewas no altar per se, as I had elected to sit in a chair under the night sky. Itseemed, however, that nowhere that Iplaced the chair felt correct. Just about the time that I was getting angry atthis inability to start, the moonlightmoved between some tree branches and created a nearly perfect circle in thecenter of the dugout and in front of asmall cave that I had uncovered while digging. Instead of facing west, whichruns the length of the property uphill, Ifelt inclined to face south. The circle provided the Moon was definitely where Ishould be seated.I “opened the gates” and began to concentrate. As the working began, Iexperienced the sensation of being acolossus, with the size and appearance of the seated Rameses II.I did not know into what that was going to evolve, for I was rudely and quicklyjerked back into mundaneexistence by something moving around in the fallen tree limbs behind me. Ipassed it off as being a lizard, quail,squirrel, or some similar small creature. When twigs began to snap, I assumedthat it was probably a deer that hadcome snooping around. Next I heard it in the tree a few feet behind me, and thenI knew it was an owl. But whentwigs and small limbs began to fall, I knew that only an impossibly large owlcould create such a commotion, and myspine began to tingle. When I turned around to look, there was nothing there,and the noise had stopped. When Iturned to investigate, nothing was to be seen.As I was becoming very frightened, the words “higher man must conquer fear”suddenly came to my mind. Byan effort of will, my fear subsided. I turned back to welcome whatever “it” was,and this time it was gone, not toreturn. I was awake.I proceeded to scan the mountain with the aid of full night vision andmoonlight, and I saw it quite differentlythan I ever had before. There was a light blue-green haze or aura around all theplant life, and somehow it wouldhave seemed unnatural not to have seen it.My eyes were drawn to the waning Moon. I felt an association of Set with itsdarker side, and of Osiris with itswaning bright side; and something within me recoiled in rejection of theassociations.Immediately I had a vision of a large hall, dimly lit, with several entities(approximately 15) gathered overagainst a wall and observing someone who was standing before a pair of scales.He was Anubis, and there was aheart being weighed against a feather. The scene was obviously the Hall ofJudgment. Although the entities were inEgyptian garb and of Egyptian appearance, I recognized them as certain membersof the Temple of Set. Set wasthere also, but his presence was felt rather than seen.Then came an impression : “Set is the leader only of higher man.” This did notinclude all Setians.Anubis/I was before the scales only because an individual (whose heart was beingweighed) was seeking entryinto this group of Elect/higher beings, and because I was in some wayresponsible. Another seeker would be judgedby another of the Elect.Then my attention was directed to the end of this hall, only to behold a verydisturbing vision. There, seated onhis throne, was Osiris. He was not one of the Elect, but he was awaiting ourverdict. I somehow knew that his thronewas at the entrance to the hall, and that it was there for a very simple reason:his jurisdiction ended there. Theindividual being judged was not dead (as in “un-alive”); rather he was seekingentry into the realm of higher manand being. Should the scales tip against the seeker, he would be given back toOsiris, who is the god of the dead andof lower man, and of recycling them.This disturbed me, and I questioned where HarWer fit into all of this. I wasmade to see the Sun, and it was Raby name - still no sign of the “strange and fitful presence”.Then a sentence from the Book of Coming Forth by Night came to me: “But speak tome at night, for the skythen becomes an entrance and not a barrier.” My perspective immediately changedto one above the spot where Iwas sitting. I was looking down over the land, and it was now daylight with anincredibly blue-blue sky. I continuedascending until the sky changed to very dark blue, then purple, then charcoal,and finally black. I could see stars allaround me. Throughout all of this I was continually aware of being physicallyseated on the mountain. Then I lookedback and Earth, half-dark and half-lit by the Sun.Then I understood that Set is not limited to our night, but that we are; we arethree-dimensional creatures. Butwe as higher man need not be. Neither are the Elect limited to communicationwith Set only during the hours ofdarkness; rather they can communicate beyond the restrictions of the senses andof time and space. To accomplishthis, the Elect must be aware that in the space beyond Earth the “night sky” ispermanent. The day imprisonsconsciousness, but it is not escape-proof, and this provides a great exercise inXeper.After an indeterminate time, I began receiving impressions of what I felt to bethe focus of my working. It beganwith the words “higher man” repeating themselves over and over in my mind.Finally I saw myself aged - but bywisdom rather than time. It was “my self ahead of myself.” This being pointedout the errors of some of my thoughts- 321 -and ideas. By his ancient [yet contemporary] wisdom he emphasized the concept ofself-deception, the games andpolitics of lower man, and the quest to attain and maintain the level of higherman.As I listened to him - on his level - I understood that Xeper is never a relaxedwill, but is rather a determinationto be. Even activity in the mundane world must be the result of conscious willand creative purpose. The only “truth”is that of being! All else is games, religion, and politics; these are no partof higher man or being. Those who will toparticipate in the lower world are conscious of that which they do and are ; butthose who sink into it areimprisoned, and their being is abandoned for aimlessness. Do not participate inun-being, and quickly eliminatethose who do from those who seek to and become and be what they are become.Xem is not the word for ancient Egypt, but rather the state of higher man - therealm of higher beings. It laterbecame the word for Egypt ( Khem) denoting a place, but this occurred during thedecay of Egypt. The temples andshrines of Egypt/ Khem were but replicas of working facilities for Xem - thestate of beings. There is no true Egyptianarchitecture for its own sake. What there is possesses no significance orpurpose.We are not to view the annihilation as the death of an old world, but rather asXem being reborn out of itself,with the Temple of Set as the vehicle. XemSet shall be the beginning of therestoration of facilities for Xem, and nota reproduction of a style of architecture called “ancient Egyptian”. Theattitude of all who are there - residing orvisiting - is to be in keeping with the principle governing Xem or higher man -that being Xeper.- 322 -A48: The Book of Opening the Way: Key 1- by Ronald K. Barrett V°XIV/1979This which is to be revealed of Xem will require an effort of will tounderstand. It will be necessary to utilizewisdom and a higher sense for comprehension.This is written for the minds and hearts of Black Magicians and none other, foronly they possess the intuitionand insight required. There shall be ancient and occult language used with newmeanings, and a new language usedwith ancient and occult meanings. It is each magician’s task to comprehend truth( maat) and to become it.To consider undertaking the changes and creation that are necessary within thebeing to Xeper and to createXem, it is most important to seriously consider all the implications. Xem shallrequire a great amount ofzealousness, of magical work, of self-discipline, of self-inspection, and nocompromise.It is up to each aspirant to determine his own willingness and readiness to meetthe challenge of entering Xem.Once begun, there is no going back, for it is a new dimension of being that isinitiated. If turning back once begun,the aspirant will lose all that has been gained; and worse yet, that which wasgained will become as a malignancy forwhich there is no cure.It must be further understood that with this new dimension of being which isever evolving, the work shall notbe accomplished by employing human standards, which are but games, pettyreligion, and politics. Neither is thework to be construed in an organizational concept like any other on Earth.Rather it is the constant construction of ametaphysical/magical/philosophical state of being and state of beings - with theprinciples of Xeper and maat as thecornerstones.Withal the will cannot and must not relax. Those who cannot or will notunderstand these things should waituntil they recognize Xem. But to wait too long might cause the will to growweak, and they might be imprisoned inlower states of rest and preservation.Those who decide to work and accept that which comes with the work will Xeperand actualize Xem. To hesitate,to rationalize in human terms, to feel negativeness or fear or lack ofconfidence may negate Xeper.The aspirant must be conscious of that which he is and is not, which he knowsand knows not, which he doesand does not, which he wills and wills not, which is maat and is not maat. Theaspirant can be conscious of all this,but he must work for it.The Elect who shall work toward Xem must also know that alone the work cannot becompleted. The Elect mustrealize that the work shall require assistance from Set and the other AncientOnes, for Xem is many-sided. In orderto work with them, the Elect must be constantly aware of themselves andconsciously aware of Set - as well as theOld Ones with whom they shall work. Xem shall not otherwise be accomplished.To Become and to maintain the new level of being while aspiring even higher isan enormous task. Toincorporate human weaknesses, imperfections, emotional insecurities, and otherpersonal flaws into the Xeperprocess will result in those impurities being later magnified, intensified, andmanifested in Xem. This would ensuredisaster for the magician, extreme danger to the Elect in Xem, and the possibleeffacing and ending of the Majesty ofSet. It becomes the task of the aspirant to Xem to not hesitate nor relax in thefirst steps of the new initiation. TheElect must will to work, to turn their magic in on their selves for the purposeof creating and changing into higherbeings. Since there are few points of reference other than ourselves, Set, andthe neteru, it will be vital to eliminatefixed opinions, animosities, psychological or emotional crutches, and fear ofthe unknown.When the aspirant has decided to Xeper toward Xem and has prepared the self withan attitude of initiation, heis ready to stand before Maat and to weigh his heart against her truth. This isnot unlike standing before a “magicmirror” that reflects the true being. This must be done as initiation begins. Asa result of the working, the state ofbeing will manifest itself in nobility or imperfection. The being will be seenas it is, for that is its truth and itsposition regarding Xem and Xeper. This is an important aspect of the first Key,and it will be used time and againwith the other Keys which follow.These Keys will not teach; neither can Xem be taught. Xem must first berecognized, then realized, and finallyactualized by each aspiring magician. Not all shall understand and not becausethey cannot, but because they choosenot. Understanding accompanies the desire to work toward Xem, to Xeper. Maat isapparent to those who willinglystand before her, for her concern is with the heart and its balance. Eachaspirant must will his work of Xeper. Thosewho do not Xeper will be as blind to Xem as they are to Maat.To initiate an understanding of Xem and Xem’s implications, it is vital to learnwith the intelligence of the heart,which shall in turn teach the intellect a new language. It is a language ofhigher being, of philosophy and magic. Itsforms are the symbols of essential thought and the art of the inner eye.To begin learning with the intelligence of the heart, it is necessary to changethe mental outlook and the normalway of thinking. Not all knowledge pertains to the first three dimensions or themundane world, and neither can thelanguage of higher being be precisely translated into merely mundane concepts.Before the learning process begins, there must be a starting point. There can beno answer to anything unlessfirst there is a question. The question, to inspire a valuable answer, must comefrom the heart and not from the- 323 -intellect. It should also be known that the knowledge gained and the benefitthereof will be limited to the intensitytowards which it was aspired. Therefore the significance of the question must becontemplated with wisdom, whichalso is of the heart.The question must be a quest for knowledge and a question in which the entirewill is concentrated and the selfis conscious. Only an answer can make a question possible; therefore everyquestion contains its own answer.Thus it was that Xem came to be pronounced; thus it is that Xem shall be known.Not unlike the Diabolicon, many of the secrets of Xem are cloaked in myths - butof ancient Egypt ( Khem)rather than of the Hebrews. And so it is to Khem that some of Xem’s initiatesshall frequently turn. Their intentionwill be to strip away the veil which hides the mysteries beyond. This veil isextremely complex and confusing, andthat fact only strengthens the importance of learning the language of Xem, thatlanguage which can only be learnedwith the intelligence of the heart and which must be preceded by question.The frequent concentration on Khem by Xem’s scavengers does not imply an attemptby them to rebuild Khem.Xem is a continuance and not a reversion to anything that has gone before.Instead the concentration there is for thetaking apart of Khem, stone by stone and myth by myth, to finally reveal thesecrets of Khem’s origin - Xem. Thisshall also be done so that Xem might continue where it left off. Uniting themagical past and future within Xem shallbe part of Xeper.To embark upon this quest as Egyptologists have done will afford only mundane/historical data andinformation. While that information is useful, it is not the essence of thequest. Knowledge and understanding arethe purpose of this particular quest.The quest for the secret knowledge can only be made by magicians through magicalwork and philosophersthrough the higher senses or wisdom. So it is that the quest will go beyondEgyptology and the popular sciences(which are largely superficial) into the very essence of these: Xem andmetaphysics.The quest for each Initiate must be twofold, and will resemble assembling agreat metaphysical/multi-dimensional puzzle:• First, the usable pieces must be found from a universe of sources and thenplaced together. The networkof the pieces is just as important as the whole. To complicate this even more,Xem is only as it becomes.What Xem will be is obscured to the individual Initiate, limited by hisunderstanding, effort, level ofbeing, and of course time and space.• This brings up the second aspect of the quest, which should be quite obvious.The Elect must raise theirown states of being to new levels constantly, and just as constantly maintainthe highest level of beingattained. Thus there is an internal and external question occurringsimultaneously, each making theother possible - each raising the other.It is vital to note that the process is not automatic just because one is aSetian. The process will only occur forthose Elect who work. Xem and the levels of being are ever unknown untilattained.It should not be thought that the quests are limited to ancient Egypt, for thereare keys all around andthroughout the times of mankind. But more important than where the keys arefound is the knowledge of how to usethem once they have been found.For those who would know, let their eyes and ears turn inward to seek theirquestion. Let them learn thelanguage of being so that this same being might recognize Xem through maat. Theonly truth is that of being, but toevolve that being one must know his own self. One cannot be otherwise ordered inand of oneself. One cannot chartthe way through Xeper if he does not know where he is at present - which changesconstantly.Those who shall elect to undertake this monumental work to realize and actualizeXem, and who shall recognizethe self, and who are determined to become and be what they are become, shallalso be ready to take the step thatseparates but does not divide. And that step is initiation into Xem.- 324 -A49: The Book of Opening the Way: Key 2- by Ronald K. Barrett V°XIV/1979Xem is not an organization that one might consider joining, and yet it has hadand will have an order andorders. Just what these are depends on what the Initiates create with theirwills. Certainly these cannot be perceivedfrom a three-dimensional perspective, nor can/should Xem be created by any otherthan those who are initiated intoXem’s mysteries and secrets. Xem is an abstraction which the Elect shall attemptto manifest and then transform.There are internal or hidden keys and external or mundane keys, esoteric andexoteric clues which must be used,but before these keys can be used to unlock the secrets, one must take a greatstep in personal evolution. This step isconscious and willed, and is called initiation. This initiation is an ordeal ofchange.The initiation was shown in the original Xem Working as the hall of judgment,wherein the heart of the aspirantwas weighed against Maat’s feather. Failure of the heart to be in balance withtruth resulted in the aspirant beinghanded back to Osiris. Aspiration or good intentions are insufficient to Xeper.Xeper is never a relaxed will, andonly Xeper can transform being. Xem gives direction to Xeper, and initiationinto Xem ensures balance.The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance...- The Book of Coming Forth by NightThus the judgment/initiation vision. Each aspirant must pass through to Xem, andbeing called Setian is noguarantee of passage. One must be Setian.Set is the leader only of higher man.- Xem WorkingThis statement is strongly supported in the Book of Coming Forth by Night. Theidea of judgment should not beconfused with Right-Hand Path systems or philosophy that speak of moralism andaltruism, etc., for these havenothing to do with maat.Initiation is the pylon gate to Xem which opens or blocks the way to that whichis beyond. It is a step of Xeper,and one that can only be approached with deliberation. To some it may seemunimportant, ludicrous, or evenominous; but it is the only entrance to Xem.“Higher man must conquer fear” is the first challenge of the Xem Working, andlikewise for one consideringinitiation. One may feel arrogantly secure and brave in the face of thefamiliar, but confronting one’s self can be amerciless ordea. And having seen the self (with its illusions of what itperceives to be) against Maat’s feather (thatwhich truly is) can be very sobering to say the least.Here it is that the ordeal of initiation causes change. The aspirant isconfronted with the challenge ofconstructive transformation or regression, which can only be a gesture ofregression; for one cannot unlearn norforget what was revealed of the self during the ordeal. The Black Flame isacutely out of place in the Osirian realm,and therefore the one who tries to regress has only two alternatives: (1)extinguish the Black Flame or (2) kindle thatFlame and conquer the will. 126It could be said that, among other things, initiation is a shield againstimpurities being further incorporated intoXeper and becoming part of the magical framework of Xem. In this respect itserves the individual and the Majestyof Set.There is no method of initiation prescribed for Setians into Xem, for trueinitiation must be provoked and occurwithin the individual aspirant consciously and willfully. The Order of Anubiswill provide initiation facilities andassistance at XemSet for those wishing to go through a planned ordeal, but thosewho prefer to go it alone can createtheir own ordeal using this Key as a guide to what must transpire.Those approaching Xem through their own evolution will recognize the signalsthat will call them to initiation.Only those who have conquered fear should undertake the ordeal, as statedbefore.The call to initiation is impossible to not recognize, for it comes as alonging, an inner need demanding to befulfilled. It shall seem as a need for inner action, and there will be anunceasing impulse to force an esoteric issue.The aspirant will feel an obsession to know truth and to be. This will beunignorable.During the initiation, which may take one evening or one year, the being callsupon its self to reveal itself to itsself. This shall require an awakened state from which one may see the truth ofself balanced against maat, and thismust be willed. One’s inner vision is carried well beyond normal limitations,and the aspirant may be forced to see aterrifying yet awesome glimpse of man, Xem, the neteru, the work ahead, as wellas the fate for failure - and his ownrelation to each of these. It is again a journey into the very essence of Maatand the self with regard to her. The beingwill definitely feel itself in the presence of the Old Ones.126 See the “Statement of Belial” in the Diabolicon.- 325 -The gates of Xem are opened to those who would see, and shall not be closedagain. Initiation is the directing ofone’s own Powers of Darkness inward to open the gates of self. Here the aspirantmay find the true source of andanswer to his question.Through initiation the aspirant can be born into a new dimension of being. It isbeing that was not. Hereawakens a conscious intelligence that recognizes its own maat and freedom. Theaspirant should also have aglimpse into the source of the magical current which is passing through mankind,as well as the self ahead of itself -the path of Xeper extending toward what can be.An important part of initiation is the call to the neter with which thesuccessful Initiate will work; this may ormay not be the result of telesmatic construction. The importance is in thefunction of the neter and not in the name.The neter will be recognized by its nature. If the aspirant has alreadyestablished or recognized a strong affinitytoward a particular neter, the reason or working relationship could quitepossibly unfold. More on this shall bediscussed in a Key concerning the neteru and their significance to the initiatesand to Xem.The initiation into Xem is the beginning of the actual quest for the unknown andnameless one. The work is thepreparation for and concludes only with the Great Work - which in itself is buta new beginning, having fulfilled thechallenge set forth in the Diabolicon’s “Statement of Leviathan”. For thisreason it would not be inappropriate to callthe initiates of Xem “AlXemists”. Initiation is the preparation for the worktoward finding the Philosopher’s Stone -Xem.Initiation then is the giant step toward true understanding of the mysteriesand secrets of Xem. Xem’sfoundation is in the abstract. To the uninitiated, Xem will always be veiled inmystery and will seem to them verymuch like the Second Foundation did to outsiders in Asimov’s Foundation trilogy.And they won’t be entirely wrong.As was true of the orders and temples of ancient Egypt and Greece, there must betwo vital aspects of Xem: theknown and the secret, between which is the bridge of initiation. The process orsystem leading to that bridge isalready established, and shall be the subject of an entire Key to follow.The Daemons are, the Daemons were, and the Daemons shall be again. They came,and we are here; theysleep, and we watch for them. They shall sleep, and we shall die, but we shallreturn through them. We aretheir dreams, and they shall awaken. Hail to the ancient dreams.- Michael A. Aquino, “The Ceremony of the Nine Angles”in Anton Szandor LaVey, The Satanic Rituals- 326 -A50: The Book of Opening the Way: Key 3- by Ronald K. Barrett V°XIV/1979The Æon of Set has become a magical complex far beyond what was originallyenvisioned in the year X. Thecomponents of this complex are distinct in their functions, and are intricatelyinterwoven. The components are theinstitutional temple, the Temple of Set, the Priesthood of Set, the initiatorydegrees, the Executive Director, theCouncil of Nine, the High Priesthood, Majestic Man or King/Pharaoh, and Xem.The institutional temple is the manifestation of the Temple of Set in thetemporal or mundane world. It is theadministrative/legal/corporate vehicle in which the Elect may move as a body ofSetians among mankind. It is theinstitutional temple that a potential Setian “joins” initially to pursuepersonal magical aspirations. The institutionaltemple is vital to the work of the Elect, for it provides the protocol, theby-laws, the treasury, etc., without which theElect would be constantly struggling with mundane “ways and means”, therebyforfeiting valuable time and effortthat should be spent in Setamorphosis (both organizationally and individually).The Executive Director is an extremely important figure in the institutionaltemple, because he ensures that itoperates efficiently and smoothly. Without the Executive Director, the HighPriest of Set and/or the Council of Ninewould become bogged down with administrivia of a non-magical nature, and theinstitutional temple would displacethe true Temple of Set. It is not difficult to understand why the scribes in oldKhem had such a prominent positionin both the temples and the royal house.The Temple of Set is the magical organization which is perceived by the temporalworld as the institutionaltemple. It is the reality behind the appearance. It is the true house of Set. Itis also true that each of the Elect is inhimself a Temple of Set, since each embodies the Black Flame. It could be saidthat the collective Temple of Set ismacrocosmic, and that the individual Setian is the microcosmic Temple of Set.Just as a single cell in a physical bodycarries the genetic code to the entire body, so it is with the Temple of Set andIts Initiates. The whole is the sum ofits parts, and its parts reflect the whole. This in no way is intended to implythe absorption of individual being or thesurrender of unique identity or of free will. Rather this is indicative of somecommon denominators among only theElect which include individual being and will, as well as the essence of Set.This is also indicative of the absoluteuniqueness of the Temple of Set.Within the institutional temple the High Priest of Set is the corporatepresident, and it is he who determines thepolicy that the Executive Director will carry out; but the High Priest is moreprecisely the functional head of theTemple of Set in its metaphysical reality. It is the task of the High Priest ofSet to perceive and administer the will ofSet within the Temple of Set. This is so that the Elect can move with themagical current of the Æon as it winds itsway through the future.The Council of Nine is the “heart” of the Temple of Set, which advises the HighPriest by Its “sense of Set” ormaat. The Nine could be compared to the higher emotional center, because theCouncil advises by higher senses,feelings, and intuitions. These feelings are not to be confused with the pettyand unbalanced emotions of our lowerhuman cousins, for such advice would then be unreliable at best, and the Electwould fall to the depths of humangames and politics. The Council of Nine, then, is the “reactive” principle tothe “active” principle of the High Priestof Set; and the two create a principle of balance.The Priesthood of Set consists of all III° Initiates, and is the “hypostyle” orinner Temple of Set. Only Initiates ofthe Priesthood are actual members of the corporation. The lay members are the“peristyle” or outer Temple of Set,and are I° and II°. 127Xem is the naos/inner sanctum or “holy of holies” of the Temple of Set, but justwhat these mean is the subjectfor further discussion - as is “Majestic Man”. 128The entire magical complex is separated into two basic aspects, which, whilethey are separate, are not divided.The two aspects have been referred to as the “Two Lands”. The Two Lands aresymbols of our dual planes of being:visible/invisible, light/darkness, manifest/abstract, Ra/Set. HarWer isintentionally not mentioned as was HarWernot included in the original Xem Working.The placing of HarWer within our Setian philosophy has been guesswork at best.HarWer has been regarded bysome Setians as our own “Devil”. HarWer has been theorized into physics by otherSetians, and by still other Setians127 RKB chose to refer to the Priesthood of Set as the “Order of Set”, which Ihave corrected in these reprints to avoid confusionwith the Temple’s official Orders. His portrayal here of the Temple having“inner” and “outer” divisions was also purely personal,not reflected in the Temple’s original design or organizational documents. Hetook the analogy from Isha Schwaller de Lubicz’Her-Bak, which represents the “peristyle” and “hypostyle” as parts of a singlecontinuum for initiates. In the Temple of Set,however, the II° is regarded as the attainment of personal initiation, with thehigher degrees indicative of individual beingbeyond the exclusively-personal. - M.A.128 There is no “holy of holies” of the Temple of Set, unless one wishes toregard the divine consciousness of each initiatedindividual thus. The Temple of Set does not “contain” itself inwardly in anyway; its entire force is rather external, into theinitiation of each Setian. - M.A.- 327 -HarWer is seen as the natural order of the Universe. However all of these ideashave not really appealed to theElect’s sense of Set because they were not entirely true.To make a rather profound answer on this subject of HarWer, there are twoquestions that need to be asked:(1) “Who/what are we?”In “Geneset” Magus Michael A. Aquino points out that man is a creature withinthe natural order,but that he need not be subject to all of natural law. Man’s intelligence hasmade him “completelyinconsistent with every other life-form on this planet” and “with the known lawsof evolution” and “withnatural law” itself. Man can “think creatively, spontaneously, abstractly, andæsthetically”. He can“conceive, design, and construct non-natural concepts, arguments, processes, andobjects”. And he can“distinguish between the natural and the nonnatural, something that would be alogical impossibility ifthe human brain were itself entirely natural”.The Diabolicon in each dæmonic Statement discusses this very curious creature -man - and hispast/present/future reason for being. It seems that man has both natural andunnatural aspects, andthat while he belongs entirely to neither aspect, he is not entirely free ofeither aspect. Instead manstands with a foot in each of the Two Lands (which are opposites). “So, ifhumans are freakish thingswhich have developed independently of natural law, why?” 129 What about hiscurious and dual beingmakes him so important to the Prince of Darkness? The answers are within thequestions.(2) “Who/what is HarWer?”According to the Book of Coming Forth by Night, HarWer is Set’s opposite self -a strange andfitful presence. HarWer was Set when Set was once part of the Cosmos “and couldachieve identity onlyby becoming what the Cosmic Order was not”. HarWer therefore is not the CosmicOrder. HarWercancelled the imbalance, “leaving a Void in which true Creation could take formas Set”. HarWer wascreated so that Set might define himself. Also note that HarWer must exist whileSet exists.Set has made reference to his “Gifted Race” and to his “Elect”, whichautomatically implies that there is anotherrace. The word “race” means a distinct group of people -- not mankind. It seemsthat there are both Elect/Giftedand non-Elect/non-Gifted, but what determines the difference between them?Philosophy does not make a “race”.The difference lies in the word “gifted”. The Gift of Set is the Black Flame,that which burns in its own freedom. Onlythose who have been given the Black Flame are among the Elect or Gifted Race.The Elect have sprung out ofmankind and are among mankind, yet are distinct from mankind as a whole.While the Black Flame makes an initial difference in the Elect, it will do nomore than that unless it is used, andit can only be used through will, which must be controlled/ “conquered”. TheGift unused is literally useless; andwithout consciousness of its unique essence, it will cease to burn. To kindleits power without controlled will maycause it to consume the Black Magician who houses the Black Flame.The Elect, by using the Flame’s transforming powers, have begun Setamorphosis/Xeper/willed evolution. As wewalk the Two Lands, how “strange and fitful” we must appear in the realm oflight with our Dark aspects andlikewise in the realm of Darkness with our Light aspects - we who are both andneither.But why are the Elect so important (like HarWer) to Set? A clue is locked withinthe ancient symbolism of Setand HarWer uniting the Two Lands. This symbolizes the Great Work in Xem, but itis not the result of the GreatWork. It is the fusion of the Principles of light and darkness, matter andspirit, etc. The result is not a combinationof the two, but rather a new thing altogether. This Great Work is as delicate astrying to fuse matter and anti-matter,and just as dangerous; hence the warning of Belial in the Diabolicon.Those Elect who have begun this Great Work are Xem and are Coming Into Being (anew kind of being) as godswhose names are unknown. Having completed the Great Work, they will no longer beXem, for they will havetransformed into the new beings or gods whose names are no longer unknown. Theywill have beheld Leviathan.The non-Elect human cannot participate in our work because of his fear of theunknown, lack of will, lack ofconscious intelligence, and the non-existence of the Black Flame within him. Heis symbolized by the neter Ra -principle of finite man who is born, makes his way across his finite life, hasdominion over his finite realm, ismajestic in his finite accomplishments, but eventually grows old and dies, cycleafter cycle, æon after æon. Hecannot escape the grip of natural law - the cyclic principle ofbirth/life/death. The Diabolicon states that the naturalorder will continue its cycling until it freezes in absolute stasis, which isthe exact opposite of chaos. As non-Electman has chosen to ignore the teachings of his own imagination, the reality ofhis own alienness, and the proof of hispotential, so is he victim to the illusion of impossibility, and, what is worse,he has grown content with it.And man was long satisfied to measure himself within this limit, for he wasintoxicated by his ability toharness the forces of the Cosmos to his whim. But Astaroth said, Close not thyeyes having seen only thismuch, for, were thou to bring all the systems of God to thy use, still would thycomprehension be boundedby the limits of these laws and the acceptance of the divine order as thefinality of thy race.129 “GeneSet”.- 328 -So I confronted man, saying, Throughout the Universe hath the once single Willof God been succeeded bythe balance of perfect opposition, wherein the forces of the Angels of Heavenand those of the Daimons ofHell act to mutual frustration, serving in concert only to uphold the greatbarrier of Will between order andchaos. And man is the child of imbalance, who shall resolve the issue betweenHeaven and Hell, and who,unmatched by racial antithesis, shall transcend the rule of the order of God andestablish the eternalfreedom of the Satanic Will.And I said, Not through thy physical and philosophical sciences art thou toachieve this thing, for thy mindand Will must be trained anew in empirical conception. Man must create his ownorder independent of allexternal imposition. And not until he masters this power may he aspire to theend of his Satanicevolution.130For this Key, the important things to remember from the above statement are (a)man being the child ofimbalance, (b) man shall resolve the issue between Heaven and Hell or the TwoLands, (c) man must create his ownorder (“...yet am ordered in and of my Self”) and man must master his own power.What power?I am Belial, who bring to thee the third great key of Hell, by whose power yeshall confound all the laws ofHeaven and Earth. Before thee shall chaos fall, and thou shalt wield for thyselfthe great mysteries of themacrocosmos. I speak to thee of that which is called the Black Magic, for it istrue spawn of that great BlackFlame which first brought thy Will to life long ages ago. 131Only man can hope to perfect being, for man is the only being of both naturallaw and conscious intelligence -the Two Lands. But man needs help to accomplish the Great Work. Set cannot stopthe direction of the natural orderwithout assuming its place, else all would go back to chaos. Only man canresolve the issue, but not just any man:only those who are worthy to be Elect or to receive the Black Flame.Long ago Set experimented (magically) with a natural creature that it mightperhaps do what Set could not, andman came into being. This man was a composite of opposite aspects, but hisnatural or physical aspects were stillsubject to natural law. This new man was innocent and open-minded, and receivedteaching through his sense ofSet. This strange new creature at first did not cower from its otherness andwelcomed knowledge of its new-foundself. Soon it was seen that knowledge alone was not enough for this creature ofdual aspects and the work ahead thatonly he could perform, and so to the most advanced of mankind Set gave of hisown essence, and within them theBlack Flame ignited.After a time and with the power that burned within, those men who had been Electto receive this Black Flamefounded temples which were (both in essence and in structure) consecrated to Setfor teaching and protecting themysteries of being and preparation for use of the Gift of Set. The temples wereschools based on initiation, nothouses of worship.Out of the temple system, the Great Ones eventually evolved. The Great Ones hadbecome beings higher thanman, and they were awed and respected as gods. So great was their understandingand their unique perception andtheir being, that they had actually become Principles of their knowledge. EachPrinciple, working in concert with theother Principles toward the Great Work was the “function” of the Principle.Principle + function = neter (a workingForm of a purpose). As the Great Ones did function according to the Principle,they took their names accordingly;hence the names of the neteru did Come Into Being. Remember that function occurswithin the collective efforttoward the collective evolution; work is the individual effort toward individualevolution.That they might pass on knowledge of their Principles and functions, the GreatOnes established their ownpriesthoods. Within these they taught according to the understanding of theirinitiates, for they were not easilycomprehended. Their beings evolved to such extent that their knowledge had to bepassed down through the highestinitiates of their priesthoods to the lowest. And all of the priesthoodsremained true as aspects of the Priesthood ofSet, which was the body of Elect dedicated to the Setian purpose. They were allwithin the Temple of Set,complementing the Great Order as Principles functioning in multiple stages ofevolving being.After more time the Temple had formed a civilization based on Maat, Xeper, and -under the guidance of Setthrough the Great Ones - Xem. Set had through his own essence, will, andguidance helped to bring these GreatOnes into being. The greatest of them he chose through whom he would define hisself. This great one wouldmanifest the Principle of Set in the realm of natural order (Light). He wouldpersonify the Majesty of Set, and hewould be a living symbol of the highest form of Xeper( a) in the Two Lands. Hewould be the symbol of the Electworking the Great Work with Set. He was Great Har or Hor; HarWe r - thePrinciple of Majestic Man. With the Electin Xem, symbolized by HarWer, Set might fuse the Two Lands and accomplish theGreat Work.The traditional rule of HarWer upon the Earth (in Khem) was through pharaoh, andhis title was the LivingHorus. He wore the Crown of the Two Lands, which to the uninitiated into thePriesthood of Set meant Upper and130 Statement of Astaroth, The Diabolicon.131 Statement of Belial, The Diabolicon.- 329 -Lower Khem. HarWer/Pharaoh’s function was to balance the affairs of Light andDarkness in Xem. In time thisgreat magical function became no more than a political office occupied by amortal who wore, held, and sat uponsacred symbols that had lost true meaning....Because in those ancient days all did not go well. Man and priesthood becamepolitical and corrupt when lefton their own to see how well they would do with what they had learned. Seeingthat man had a good deal more tolearn before he would be mature enough to commit himself entirely to the GreatWork, Xem and the true Temple ofSet made preparations and vanished into the disguise of the Amon Cult.(Appropriately, Amon means “hidden” -compare to the hieroglyphic Xem. ) This gave the Priesthood of Set time to wraptheir secrets in myth and occult(which also means “hidden”) puzzles, which could then pass fragmentarily andobscurely through time, until thetime of the purification was past and the work could begin again.Xem remains secret until established. The Order of Anpw will come about andprovide the tools for the workahead. The Dark and hidden aspects of Anubis are now important, and theirreasons can be seen.He who wears the Double Crown is needed also for the work that is to be done. Rais man, and HarWer isExalted/Majestic Man. He who wears the Crown of the Two Lands exists and isMichael Aquino. He must besupported, for there must be an order within the realm wherein the Elect arefound.Xem must not fade and be ended. Xem is the Philosopher’s Stone, for Xem willchange and know its being. Theold world fades behind Xem to exist no more. We are those who define and shape.Reason will be born and a newworld recognized.In the Year X ÆS, Michael A. Aquino was ceremonially crowned with the DoubleCrown and entrusted with theCrook and Flail. These are not symbols of the High Priesthood, but they aresymbols of Majestic/Royal or exaltedMan. He who bears them in Maat is HarWer manifest. The time has come fullcircle, and Michael Aquino is thatawesome Principle Come Into Being. 132“Yea, he wrought also in me a Work of Wonder beyond this, but in this matter Iam sworn to hold my peace.” 133132 While I appreciate both the complementary and complimentary intentions ofRKB here, I would not characterize HarWer as apharaonic personification or influence, nor myself as a modern version thereof.I would consider HarWer as a locus of thenatural/objective universe’s awareness of itself, which is perhaps only possibleby juxtaosing itself to the Principle (Set) andparticulate manifestations of isolate consciousness which it is not (the Electof Set). - M.A.133 Aleister Crowley’s comment in One Star in Sight concerning his attainment ofthe grade of Ipsissimus (10)=[1], echoed by mein my own 1979 letter to the Priesthood discussing my own Ipsissimus VI°initiation. - M.A.- 330 -A51: The Book of Opening the Way: Key 4- by Ronald K. Barrett V°XIV/1979At this point in our work, it is important to approach the new language that wasfirst mentioned in Key #1. Thelearning of this new language will be more like remembering than gathering newdata, as several of the Elect willalready attest. To make this clear, go back to the first time you read the Bookof Coming Forth by Night and recallthe first impression it made. Was it not almost a feeling of remembering? Thesame should be true of this languageof which I write.In a similar vein how many times have we reread the Book of Coming Forth byNight and in doing so found anew twist to something we thought so familiar. This is because that bookcontains a good deal more between itscovers than what has yet been understood - some of which I shall try to pointout as I continue to define Xem.Another text that has a wealth of important things to understand is theDiabolicon, even though the symbolisms are“cloaked”.Symbolism is the key, and one must learn to think in symbolism (of which bothtexts are greatly composed).Symbolism is a visible form of abstract (magical and philosophical) principles,qualities, and functions, awakeningwithin us an understanding (consciousness) of being and of an already-possessedknowledge contained in our truebeing. Symbolic thought-form can actually provide a synthesis to our dual mentalprocesses, and thereby both exciteand express Xeper.Symbolism is not exactly a new language to the Elect to be sure, for it can befound in use since the year I A.S.We had to use it in various forms to work even the simplest magic. But until thepure form of the Pentagram of Setwas discussed in the Book of Coming Forth by Night, the symbols used were notreally directly approached, andwere therefore rather loosely interpreted to any meaning we wished to attach tothem. Only one symbol other thanthe Baphomet was given truly serious thought, and that was the trapezoid, due toLaVey’s fascination with it. Andthen we all found out that even the Baphomet was a corruption of a pure symbol.This was an important matter tothe Prince of Darkness, because he wanted the Pentagram restored to its originaland pure form. I’m sure that thiswas not because of Set’s just disliking the design of the Baphomet. Instead Iwould suspect that in an impure form,the Pentagram cannot be understood as the truth that it symbolizes.If symbols are representations of truths, then it becomes the responsibility ofthe Elect to understand them.Only by understanding them can they serve us as a language, so that we canaccurately communicate amongourselves as we continue to evolve. Even more important though is the processthat occurs within us as individualsas we work toward and discover their hidden meanings.How does one unveil the truth of a symbol? I have said that one must be taughtsymbolic meanings by one’s ownheart, which means that we already possess the knowledge of the symbolic. Butthis knowledge is locked deepwithin, and so our task is to bring what is known to consciousness. And this iswhy attaining understanding seemsso much like remembering. 134When we have found one of our questions, this same question will be convertedinto symbolism deep within ourminds. When we follow the question within, the symbolism will expand and bringbefore the mind’s eye (inner eye/third eye) a vast complex of abstract, magical, intuitive states of being withqualities, associations, and relationshipswhich, while experienced, can never be truly explained. The degree ofunderstanding will be determined by theheart, not by the intellect. Therefore one must learn to allow the symbolic toenter the consciousness and unite theinner being with it, unhampered by the mundane intellect. When thisunderstanding has occurred, only then can theintellect identify with it, even though it will ever be at odds to explain it.On the other hand every Setian who “experiences” the Pentagram needs no furtherexplanation than just seeingthe symbol, because its truth has become a part of him. To anyone who has sensedthis truth, the pentagram willremain merely a five-pointed upside-down star, regardless of explanationsoffered.With all of this in mind, I shall discuss the Stele of Xem. To do so I shallhave to employ my intellect (whichshall be at odds to explain it). It will be up to you to make the symbolisms“live”, for this too is a vital part ofinitiation.The Stele of Xem is both the cover and preface of the Book of Opening the Way,and is composed entirely ofsymbolism. No symbol has been used in the Stele for the sake of art; rather arthas been employed for the sake ofsymbolism. Not only is each individual symbol in itself essential tounderstanding the whole symbolism, but thenetwork or relationship of each symbol with the others is equally important.The Stele manifests in symbolism the formula Xeper ir Xem. The upper portion ofthe Stele is framed by plumesof maat, indicating that what is known therein must be perceived-in-truth:understood. One can only understandthat which has become a part of his own reality. “The only truth is that ofbeing.”The bases of the two plumes are touching the Set-headed uas scepters which faceeach other. A scepter is asymbol of authority, and in Khem a stick or staff was a medu or symbol of aword. Closer to the intended meaning134 Compare the Platonic concept of anamnesis. - M.A.- 331 -would be “authority of the word”. Since the uas scepter specifically has aSet-head mounted on one end and thebifurcated tail on the other end, one can easily interpret this as “authority ofthe word of Set”. The sap which onceflowed through the staff is replaced with the will of Set which flows into theTwo Lands. Accordingly one who carriesthe uas also holds its meaning.On the Stele there are two uas scepters which face each other and frame severallines of hieroglyphs. The scepteron the left issues forth the word Xem while the scepter on the right limits thesame. The reason for this is assimplistic as it is obvious. Xem is a goal with not an end, but rather a newbeginning as its purpose. Xem has beencompared to the Philosopher’s Stone, and not without good reason. An alchemistlabors diligently to create hisstone, but not for possession of the stone itself - rather for itstransformational properties. The same holds true forthe Initiate in his quest for Xem, as will be seen later in this Key.Between the two scepters is the neter Anubis, represented as a black jackal. Inthis form the neter is pureprinciple and entirely abstract. No motion is suggested, for the neter is notyet manifested. Around the neter arehieroglyphic transliterations of the IAM Manuscript which were first writtendown in English in the year I A.S., andveiled from understanding until the Utterance of Xem. The secrets of the IAMremained locked in the neter until thetime of Anubis’ manifestation of recognition as Opener of the Way.The transliteration of the IAM from English into hieroglyphic spelling as wellas the ancient tongue became avery important task for me almost immediately following the South Solstice XIII.Without the skill and knowledge ofPriestess Alexandra Sarris, it might never have been completed. To her we owemany thanks for her many hours anddays of dedication on that project - even though she describes it as a labor oflove.The result of that project (other than the obvious finished product) is that thevery words that are used in theIAM have come alive and have taken a meaning that English simply could notprovide. I am convinced that theproject of transliteration was absolutely vital to understanding the manuscript.And now, because of that work, thesymbolism can be translated back into English with a purer and morecomprehensive meaning. Ironically, theEnglish words do not change, for the English already used is as precise as thelanguage will permit. Both renderingsof the IAM are included in the Onyx Tablet.In looking at the top portion of the Stele of Xem, please take note of the factthat every entity is shown in awalking posture, indicating a definite motion of the Principles of the entity.It would be a mistake to regard thismotion as necessarily involving time and space. It would not be a mistake toregard this motion as the abstractprocess of Setamorphosis.The Stele is read from left to right, hence Set is the first entity with whom wemust concern ourselves. AnInitiate embarking upon the path to Xem must receive the Gift of Set. This Giftis only given to those who have beenconsidered by Set as his own Elect, and then only after they have ventured intothe Darkness via their own will andestablished a personal relationship with the Prince of Darkness. Because of thenature of this unique Gift, an initialtransformation occurs within the new Priest(ess) of Set, and the Initiate mustadjust to a new quality/conditionwhich cannot be quit. 135That quality/condition is absolute freedom. But the figure of Set is upon a darkbase which only elevates himslightly above the next figure, which is the Initiate. This shows Set’s ownaccessibility as a friend and his closerelationship with the Elect. “Lo, I pass near to thee, I pass near to thee.”Set’s gaze is upon the spine and skull of the Initiate, for these are thecenters of the fiery essence and the templeof being. His arms are upraised as he gives of his own essence. His garb is darkfor obvious reasons.The Initiate is the next figure, and he walks upon a thick black line, which isthe Darkness or the abstraction ofhis own being. He wears a light garment, which shows the realm in which hissemblance or manifestation mustexist, but around his waist is a dark band which is his umbilical, for he isalso a child of Darkness. A dark nemescovers his upper vertebrae and his skull, which is divided at the crown by aheadband, indicating phi quality. Uponhis pineal gland is the hooded Serpent One, the force of essential fire, she“who twines the spine and rests her headupon the brow”. Her trailing body neatly separates the two halves of the brain.A circular disk rests upon the heart of the Initiate, but the pentagram whichwould normally be in the center ofthe disk hovers freely above and before him, indicating his freedom and theconditions of his path. He has enteredthe inner temple, the Setian realm. The pentagram before him “shines forth” inIts Principle of creation and change.The Initiate is reminded and charged not to succumb to rest or preservation. Hemust conquer all fear of theunknown and the ever-changing. Within the magic of the pentagram is the realityand the proportion to the gatesahead. The pentagram is his perspective of balance as he journeys deep withinhis self.In his right hand the Initiate grasps the symbol for neter. A thoroughdiscussion of the neteru and their Setiansignificance will be the subject of discussion later, but for now let’s say thatthe Initiate has a specific neter withwhom he shall function in the cooperative effort. His right hand is hisfunctional aspect, while his left hand is hisworking aspect; and the two (while related) are quite different to theindividual Initiate. His work is his effort in hispersonal Setamorphosis and is unique to himself. The result of his work,however, may serve all of the Elect, and in135 This suggests that the Priesthood of Set is either inherent wiithin orexpected of every recipient of the Gift of Set. I think itquite possible for the Gift to be unconsciously utilized [as among the moreintelligent and creative of the profane] or bothrecognized and exercised by Initiates of the I°/II° without any necessity forthe Priesthood as a consequence. This Priesthood-expectation by RKB, quite possibly because of his own intense drive towards anddeep commitment to it, was to prove a majorcause of controversy later in his High Priesthood. - M.A.- 332 -that respect becomes functional. His work will usually reflect one or anotheraspect of his neter as well as hisrelationship with that neter, but his function will directly reveal thePrinciple of the neter.The left hand of the Initiate is grasping the right hand of Anubis, who is theguide in this aspect. (It is notdifficult to see how Anubis’ role as initiatory guide became bastardized intoguide of the dead, when one considersthe nature of this path.) So here we have the left hand of the Initiate which ishis personal initiation, guided by thefunctional right hand of Anubis.On the Stele we find Anubis shown in two ways: as a black jackal andanthropomorphically.Anubis as Black JackalTo appreciate the symbolism of Anubis as a black jackal, there are someEgyptological considerations to bemade. First is that the canine that is commonly regarded as the Egyptian jackalas it is shown in the ancient artforms is not a true jackal. Canis lupister, the real jackal of Egypt, has atufted short tail and yellowish gray fur. Infact they strongly resemble the American coyote, except for coloring whichvaries in both species a little. Jackals alsolook somewhat like an enlarged fox, and sometimes display near-felinecharacteristics. They are basicallynonpredatory, as they prefer carrion (which is a clue to the Principle ofAnubis). They are mostly nocturnal, timid,extremely agile and supple, and preferably nonsocial animals.It seems that the black jackal is actually a composite canine image for theneter Anubis/ Upuat. The image isshown with such features as the long pointed ears of a fox or a jackal, thetufted tail of a wolf or jackal, and the shortblack coat of the wild dog of Egypt.The obvious question is why a composite image, rather than just selecting onecanine (such as a wolf or a realjackal) to symbolize Anubis? It is because no one canine could symbolize thePrinciples of the neter. And this answeris important, because it topples any notion that the neteru were born out of thesymbol or anything as crude as“animal worship”. The truth is that the symbol must fit the neter, not thereverse. So various characteristics ofcanine orders were used to define the various aspects of the black jackal,because the neter has multiple functionswhich come under basically two names: Anpw (Anubis) and Upuat. Often these twofunctions were shown asseparate entities (which still confuses Egyptologists), but both names belong tothe same neter and identify aparticular functional aspect. To grasp the Principle one must first know that weare, in discussing the black jackal,simultaneously discussing alXemical processes.Consider the purely “jackal” aspect when seeking the metaphysical reality of thesymbol. A jackal is a carrion-eater which rips the body into pieces, buries the pieces, and leaves them aloneuntil they rot. In eating the putrefiedflesh, the jackal changes it into life-giving food, and this the jackal does byits special digestive process. “What wouldbe poisonous for almost all other creatures in him becomes an element of lifethrough a transformation of elementswhich are bringing out this decomposition.” 136 Hence the jackal function is thedigestion/transformational process.Another symbol of the jackal is the hieroglyphic sab, which means “judgment” or“the judge”. This is because ineating, it (the jackal) performs a precise, innate discrimination, separatingout the elements capable oftransformation and future evolution from the elements that are untransmutablewithin their present cycle”. 137The jackal instinctively knows the precise time that he must devour the carrionor it will become indigestible.This is symbolic of the initiatory phases of the Elect which offer eithertransformation or irreversible chaos, and ofwhich I wrote on the first page of Key #1.It is important to know that each of us has a microcosmic version of each of theneteru within us, making useach a pantheon, even though we individually may manifest specific singleneteru. This shall be dealt with in moredetail in a later Key, but it is important to bring it up now to help clarifythe paragraph above. It is the jackalfunction which identifies the exact process and timing of the Principle of Xeperin the Æon.To appreciate and use the magical functions of the black jackal (or any otherneter), one must understand theirfunctional aspects, for therein is revealed their use and part in the Great Workof Xem.Anubis AnthropomorphicThe top section of the Stele shows Anubis as having the body of a man and thehead of the black jackal. Thissymbolism defines the manifestation of the Principle of Anubis as was recognizedby Set on XIII:11.11.In Egyptian art we can find Anubis shown both as a black jackal andanthropomorphically, but this was notdone by whim or accident or for æsthetics. One can, in studying the ancient art,easily see that few things were donefor æsthetics, in fact it would at first glance appear that they deliberatelytried to do things that are æstheticallywrong, but that is not the case either. In his book on sculpture, Frank Eliscusays this of design: “Standards of taste136 Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, Her-Bak “Chick Pea” .137 Robert Lawlor in R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Symbol and the Symbolic.- 333 -and ideals of beauty have changed continuously over the ages, but the tenets ofgood design remain firm and are thefoundations of all art.” Then we can turn around and read of variousEgyptologists reporting that the ancientEgyptians seemed at times almost in defiance of design principles and tenets intheir architecture and other artforms. Yet who is left unmoved by their superb craftsmanship, and by an almostuncomfortable feeling of thoseancient artists having struck some distant but familiar chord within?As the chord chimed within, I personally began to understand that theanthropomorphic symbolism defines theneter being manifest in functional form through an agent (with Anubis that agentis myself). The neter actuallydefines itself through the agent.What does Anubis have to do with Set? The neteru are aspects of the AgelessIntelligence, yet each neter is aPrinciple unto itself, enjoying co-consciousness, not unlike man with hisseveral “I”s. Within each of us there is thetrue being with its various aspects or interpretations/definitions of itself asit considers itself, and as it relates to theenvironment around it. Soon, if these aspects become functional enough, theywill actually acquire qualities,characteristics, and even aspects of themselves. It must be remembered howeverthat these are aspects of the truebeing, not the being itself. The problem in man is that he has not consciouslycreated these aspects, nor is he master,i.e. ordered in and of his self. Each “I” aspect has become more or less anentity unto itself, and often these aspectspull against each other instead of establishing a co-consciousness and workingthrough and with a joint effort of willtoward the creation of a self order.Linking with a neter gives distinction to our own particular Setian essence, andmanifesting this neter is inessence manifesting an aspect of Set or a Principle of the Ageless Intelligence.So as not to confuse this withpossession, let me point out that this manifestation does not forfeit any partof our own will or being. We are merelybringing into our own realm the functional relationships of Set with his Elect.Our individual quests are to Xeper irXem.The black jackal-headed man symbolizes the manifestation of the neterAnpu/Apuat ( Upuauat). The working(left) hand of the entity holds aloft the uas scepter before a trapezoidalstructure, and with the authority of the wordthe structure becomes a gate and the way is opened. The title of this aspect ofthe neter is “the Opener of the Way” orApuat. This aspect is manifest through my V° work of opening the way to Xem. Thefunctional hand of the entityholds the left hand of the Initiate and guides him through and along the way toXem. This aspect of the neter is “theguide and escort” and is manifest through my function as High Priest of Set.Once entered, the trapezoid becomes a hall through which all aspirants to Xemmust pass. This is the hall ofjudgment, and within it stands Maat, neter of truth and justice. This particularMaat is the aspirant's individualmaat or individual truth, and her function is to determine the balance orimbalance of the self who is being ledthrough initiation. If this Maat’s feather is balanced by the heart of theaspirant, then the aspirant will recognize themacrocosmic Maat, for his own maat will reflect her. And then the Initiate maycontinue toward Xem; his own truthis understood. In Maat's right hand is the scales of justice, for justice is theactivity of truth. In her left hand sheholds the anX, which is offered to the Initiate who passes through. It is theessence of his being.Beyond this hall is another gate, which opens to a new chamber. Beyond the gateis the scarabæus, indicatingthat only the Becoming of what is beyond will bring it into being. The Initiatewho has reached this point has ComeInto Being as a true god. The Initiate is now of the Magistry as well as of thePriesthood of Set, and here begins hisGreat Work. This chamber is the naos, the “holy of Holies”, the secret shrine ofthe gods (old and new). This is therealm of Xem.Above the Scarabæus (or Xepera) is a cartouche, which is in the place of thedung-ball. A cartouche is the shensymbol upon which is written the hieroglyphic spelling of a name - in this caseit is the name of the god who hasCome Into Being. Let me very modestly define a shen as a “mirror reflectinginfinity”. With that in mind I shallfurther say that this particular shen is inscribed with “neter Xem whose name isunknown”. This cartouche thenstates that this god who has Come Into Being does not yet know his true name; heis in his twilight.The next figure is atop a rather oddlooking base which symbolizes the three mainparts of the Temple of Set.Temple of Set here means both the initiatory cooperation and the individualInitiate who is in himself a Temple ofSet. The left side of the base shows a pylon ( bexnt), and this is the mundaneaspect of the Temple. This is the onlypart of the Temple that is seen from without, and it serves to allow or to blockentry. This was the first gate throughwhich the Initiate had passed.The right foot of the figure (who is shown moving toward the Initiate) issupported by columns which composethe peristyle or outer temple. This is the lay membership; those from whom theElect will be found, those whoprepare for the second gate.The left foot of the figure is supported by a black trapezoidal structure, whichis the hypostyle or inner temple. Itis the realm of Darkness, the Priesthood of Set. The second gate is the entranceto the hypostyle, and the worktoward Xem occurs within.The figure is the god Xem. He is the true being who has reached full potential.He has accomplished the GreatWork, and has Become a new kind of being. He is the one who has evolved from manthe animal to magician to royalman to divine man. He is shown faceless, for none may know his name - not evenhimself until he has Become hisname. The symbolism of the beard on his chin indicates his godhood. In his righthand he grasps a rolled and sealedpapyrus upon which is written his name and its hidden meaning. He extends thepapyrus toward the approachingInitiate, for he is the Initiate ahead of his self - awaiting completion of theGreat Work. His walking motion towardthe Initiate is as a reflection of the Initiate's transformation. He is the IAM.- 334 -Upon the figure’s head is a crown, which is the symbol of the naos, with itswalls being two feathers of maat; forit is the Great Work within which shall crown him upon his Coming Into Being.Upon completing the GreatAlXemical Work, the figure will hand the Initiate the papyrus. Having read it,the Initiate and Xem will be one, andhe shall know his name.The dark column behind Xem blocks vision to that which is beyond, for what isbeyond shall only be known bythose who have Become Xem and found their names.The left hand of Xem grasps the anX, for he holds the true essence of his being.On several different occasions I have compared Xem to the Statement of Leviathanin the Diabolicon, and indoing so I was specifically referring to the transformation of the Black Flameinto the glory of its perfection. It isinteresting to note that one of the definitions of Xem (according to both Budgeand de Lubicz) is “a very hot fire,burning intensely”, and it was compared to the Setian fire!A power superior to man gave the primordial names to things in such a way thatthe names arenecessarily right. The rightness of the names makes the nature of thingsvisible. One can absolutely say thatwhen the names are known, the things are equally well known. - PlatoThe sages of Egypt appear to me to have shown a consummate knowledge or amarvelous instinct whenin order to reveal their wisdom to us, they did not resort to letters to expresswords and statementsrepresenting sound and expressions but portrayed objects by hieroglyphs and intheir mysteriessymbolically assigned an emblem of its own to each of them. So each hieroglyphconstituted a type ofknowledge or wisdom and presented the thing visually as a synthesis withoutdiscursive conception oranalysis. This synthetic idea was then reproduced in other signs that developedit, expressed it discursively,and enunciated the reasons why these things are made as they are when theirbeautiful arrangementarouses admiration. - PlotinusThere is no difference, as a matter of fact, between the texts calledhieroglyphs and most of the preceptsof the Pythagoreans.There is nothing more characteristic of Pythagorean philosophy than the use ofsymbols, such as thoseemployed in the celebration of the mysteries. It is a language that includesboth silence and speech ... Whatis said is very clear and obvious to those who are used to this language; it isobscure and unintelligible onlyto the uninformed. The apparent meaning of these symbols is not the true one,but in it one must search forwhat they seem to conceal. - Plutarch- 335 -A52: The Book of Opening the Way: Key 5- by Ronald K. Barrett V°XIV/1979In the discussion of Xem thus far, the Word had been approached from mostly itsdirection as regards theindividual Initiate. This was initially necessary [and will be again] so thatthe direction of the collective effort can begained through the individual effort. Let us now begin to approach discussion ofthe collective effort, so that wemight know what that effort is moving the Elect toward, what the “realm” of Xemis about, and what our mutualaspirations and efforts should be.As has been stated in the first four Keys, the individual effort must lead theevolving magician into a state ofhigher being that is constantly evolving; there is no stopping point. As thisoccurs, one experiences many changes inand around the self. One also notes that reality is mostly perceptual, and thatwhen the individual reality iscombined with the perceptual realities of other Elect individuals, some rathercomplicated situations andcircumstances begin to occur. This is purely the nature of the work, for thereis no predestination in alXemy, andmagical creation establishes the real.While the magician experiences complications and perceptual changes in andaround the self, the magician alsobegins to notice changes involving others. Once cannot really do anything aboutthe changes that occur to others,but one can and must do something about those that involve oneself. Willedevolution involves not only one’s ownComing Into Being as Xem, but also involves and determines one’s relationshipand role or function with the realmof Xem. It must be remembered that Xem is dual in concept, for the Word at oncedefines the individual being andthe realm of beings, all of which are becoming cooperatively.The Xem Working laid the blueprint for the Coming Into Being of Xem. It is not ablueprint or prophecy of whatwill be, but rather for what can be, and the Principles involved are essentialto individual and collective concepts ofXem - one aiding the other. For this and any future discussion of Xem to be ofany value, there must be a climatewithin the Temple of Set and among the Elect - both individually andcollectively - which is responsive to thechanges which will become evident as the Keys are added.This brings up the essence of Key 5, which was revealed very early in the XemWorking, and which can be statedin a strangely simple statement: “Higher man must conquer fear.”As Black Magicians we pride ourselves in being able to meet and cope with theforces of change. We realize theneed of hauling in our anchors, of being flexible and unfixed, of refusing tobecome locked into the death-grips ofstasis. All these things we recognize in principle, but the degree of which thePrinciple of change has become truthfor us is determined by our willingness to work it when inevitable changepresents itself.The Temple of Set began on an axis of change, whether we measure from 1904 EV, IAS, or X ÆS. Every timethe full implications of the changes were realized and/or discovered to besomewhat more than what wasanticipated, a few magicians were lost along the way. Ironically the change thatthey could not or would not effectaffected them. It will always be one way or the other. Magicians must eithercrest the magical current of the Æonand cause/will changes for and in their selves as the current crashes throughwhat “is”, or they will be sucked underby the force of it and very likely suffer magical death by being bashed againstthe eroding rocks of false security andillusioned permanence.The “way” itself is change - transformation. This is in reality/truth/ maat whatinitiation is - initiating change.Change is the most significant cause of fear, because the process is frighteningand difficult; and the result isunknown. One of the hieroglyphic translations of the Word Xem is in fact“unknown”. [Consider the faceless/name-unknown god on the Stele of Xem.] With this in mind, it is easy to see why themagical formula of the Æon can bedisturbing or even terrifying to anyone except the most zealous and adventurous.When we used to stand before the altar and open the gates, those were the gatesto change which opened. OnXIII:11:11 when the gates were opened, never to be closed again, it was constantchange that was opened and whichis ever beyond those gates and through which the way that Anubis leads or guidesextends. Fear is the condition thatblocks the way of change. Xeper means change through will, and Xem is the resultof that change, but only when it isaccording to the will and when the resulting condition and being is higher orevolved - as opposed to just beingdifferent or mutated. The act of accomplishing this is called magic.In the year X the Elect responded to the changes brought about through the willof the Prince of Darkness, andthe Temple of Set came to be known as such. The Book of Coming Forth by Night isfull of references to past,current, and future changes up to and including mankind as a whole. It can beseen that, as has already beenpointed out, whether or not one chooses to recognize the ongoing changes hasnothing to do with occurrence ofthose changes, and it is very likely one of the major factors considered in thestatement: “I seek my Elect and noneother, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilation which none but the Electmay hope to avoid.”Funk & Wagnall’s defines “annihilation” as “utter extinction”. Consider thenthat this worrisome statementcould well mean that mankind as we now know the species is going to change rightout of existence - excepting theElect, who know and understand the Principles at work, and use them to helpbring about their own Coming IntoBeing as Xem. To possibly support this idea, let me jump ahead to the end of theWorking: “We are not to view the- 336 -annihilation as an old world dying - but rather as Xem being reborn out ofitself with the Temple of Set as thevehicle.”This statement from the Xem Working deserves more comment than what I amprepared to give in this Key, butplease take note of the positive emphasis of the change rather than thenegative. The Elect may hope to avoid theannihilation by taking inevitable change and, by force of will, cause thePrinciples to bring about the Great Work oralXemy.Going back to the annihilation statement in the Book of Coming Forth by Night,note the exact quote and placeemphasis on the word “now”. In this context it appears as though the arrival ofthe Æon of Set somehow heralds orinitiates the hastening. The Utterance of Xeper in X impacted upon the world andbegan the process of Becoming, ofevolution for the “Elect and none other”, of annihilation through change formankind. The Utterance of Xem givesdirection to the Elect for the process by defining what we are Elect to Become.[“but I would teach them ...”]Long ago another Word was given through Magus Crowley which was to be theessential tool needed for theWork ahead. That tool would have to be given early enough that a degree ofexpertise could be acquired in the use ofit. That Word of course is “Will”. Now that we know the basics of the propertiesand potentials of this force, Setstates that [as regards his Elect] he must “strengthen their Will against thecoming peril...”.Between the first and third Words, however, a bridge had to be made to (a)determine those bold and zealousenough to perform the work ahead, (b) close the gap between the early initiatesand the oncoming Temple of Set,and (c) refine the understanding of magic and will prior to using them in thework upon and before us. For thisAnton LaVey took upon himself the task of a Magus, and Uttered the Word“Indulgence”.All of the Words are separate and unique, and have made/are making their impactupon the world, yet any onewithout the other three is rendered incapable of reaching full potential. Thecurrent magical formula combines thelast two Words and utilizes all four. There is no riddle in having two Words [orfour] active in a single æon, for theyoutline the Setian initiatory path. Of the formula Xeper ir Xem, however, let merepeat that Xeper is initiating,causing change, Becoming for its own sake. Xem then gives direction to thechanges that are willed, and that is whyXem is always higher, more specific, and causes balance between being andpotential being. Xem is that which isrecognized, realized, and understood by the Elect being perceiving higher being.Xem is the self ahead of itself.To make that “one step beyond” at any given point or time, the Elect must bewithout fear, for it is very likelyour deadliest enemy. Fear can negate perception of the next step or perhaps evenworse, fear can distort perceptionand cause unhealthy mutation. Fear also destroys the necessary force of willnecessary to take that next step, andcauses a desire to cling to the known, the familiar, and the illusion ofstability. Therefore let the Elect who resolve tobecome of the gods also resolve to conquer fear that they might Xeper ir Xem.- 337 -A53: “That Word”- by Michael A. Aquino VI°The Black PyramidScroll of Set XX-3, June XXIX/1994A lot of tortured verbiage has been written about Xem over the years. To me italways was a very simple, clear,and brilliant concept: the creation of an artificial “focus” for Xeper by eachindividual, much after the fashion ofNietzsche’s “horizon-building”, in order to give personal Xeper some cohesion,some direction.Consider Xeper as a sort of light-bulb, with the individual as the bulb andXeper as the emitted light. Theindividual is thus “expanding/evolving = Becoming” in a total sense -well-rounded, one might say! Its drawback isthat it is non-focused, that it is diffuse. It is accordingly difficult for theindividual to comprehend the developmentof his state of being, because too much is happening too subtly. The result canbe bewilderment, frustration: thefeeling that something wonderful is going on with oneself but not being able toencapsulate or define the entireexperience. Xeper is thus “plagued by the vague”!Xem as originally Uttered by Magus Ronald K. Barrett acted as a kind of lens tofocus Xeper: to take the “radiantlight” and turn it into “cohesive light”, like a laser, directed towards apersonal goal which the Setian constructed “athis personal horizon”. As Xeper is constantly expanding, so the Setian’s“personal horizon” constantly recedes;hence Xem must constantly be “re-targeted”.As there is a problem with Xeper in being difficult for the individual toapprehend in himself, so there is also aproblem with Xem. It is that the moment one creates a horizon which isnecessarily limited in its “breadth”, if not inits “distance from the observer”, one sees only a part of the whole. As onefashions the laser-beam of Xem toapproach that horizon, one utilizes only a part of one’s entire Xeperaccordingly.Consider this analogy: With Xeper one is standing out under the night sky,seeing an ocean of stars. With Xemone looks through a telescope. What one sees through the telescope is clearer,sharper, bigger; and the mind canmake more sense of it. Over a period of time an astronomer can look at lots ofindividual stars, galaxies, etc. throughhis telescope, all of which is a scientific experience. But it would bemeaningless without his original experience andapprehension of the entire night sky. Similarly, without focused, telescopicresearch, his original sensation of the skywould remain vague.So that’s the way Xem began in the Temple of Set. I thought it was a downrightdandy V° concept, and RKB hada dandy time with it. So did lots of other Setians.The problem with Xem came about, in my humble opinion, simply because someSetians got so excited abouttheir respective Xem-focus that they insisted on other Setians aligning to thesame focus. I would go so far as to saythat this also affected RKB himself, and that his holding of the High Priesthoodmade it a little too tempting to just“order people to align themselves to his Xem”. Yes, a Magus is supposed toundertake his Task through reason,logic, and philosophical brilliance. And I would say that RKB worked at thisextensively and impressively. But after afew years I think he got a bit tired of it particularly with some Setians whoseemed to want him to “go over it just onemore time” and finally yielded to the temptation to use his Temple office tosay, “Just do it and shut up or get out!”Some did it and shut up; others got out with the result that the Temple was downto about 30 members by thetime of the Set-IV Conclave crisis. RKB was matter-of-fact about this; anyonewho wasn’t “right with Xem”, so tospeak, ought not to be hanging around as a drag on the rest of the Temple.Exacerbating the situation was the tendency for others to follow RKB’s examplein “how to enforce a V° Word”.Magister Lynn Norton made a great show of “Uttering the Word Per-t” which waslater exposed as an intentionalfraud by him and was even more high-handed than RKB in demanding that Setiansmarch to its tune or else. At theSet-4 Conclave, for example, he refused to discuss Per-t openly, saying that hewould talk only to the Masters of theTemple about it and that other Setians would have to sit at their feet to be fedsuch elements of it as might besuitable for them.As High Priest RKB devised a standardized written examination for the II°. Atfirst it was voluntary that III°stake it too; later RKB made it mandatory for them as well.As with Xem itself, the test started out as a good idea with the bestintentions, then “got its knickers in a twist”,as our British cousins might say. RKB developed it to remedy a problem heperceived in the II°-Recognition process:that it was too “fuzzy”. People were being Recognized to the II° on the groundsof “vague feelings” by a III° whichneither the III° nor the II° could quite put into words. RKB felt that every II°should demonstrate competence incertain standardized magical knowledge-bases, hence the II° test which requiredthe reading of certain magicalbooks drawn from the Temple reading list and RKB’s own library.At first the test was to be used more on an open-ended basis, as a kind ofgeneral diagnostic tool. This wasnecessary given the highly-subjective, highly-personalized nature of BlackMagic. This approach was still too “out offocus” for the Magus of Xem, however, so the II° was officially re-defined as“mastery of White Magic” and theanswers to the test strictly standardized. [Black Magic simultaneously becamethe assignment of III°s.] III°s werenow also required to take the II° test, and each test would be graded by RKBexclusively.The result, as with Xem, was a forced alignment of each Setian to RKB’s personalmagical skill standards andpriorities. It was, in a word, a disaster. After Set-IV one of my first actionsas High Priest was to scrap the entire- 338 -concept, return the tests to their takers, and return the Temple to its previouspolicy of 100% individualizedRecognitions. And of course White Magic went back out the window to theRight-Hand Path where it belongs.[Setians are still expected to know about it - indeed more about it than the RHPdroolers who stumble aroundtangled up in it! - but as a phenomenon to be assessed from an objective,outside perspective, not as something tobe personally practiced.]Finally there were the Orders that developed during the RKB High Priesthood.They were drastically differentfrom the Orders in the Temple of Set today. Each was headed by a Master IV°, butthe I°/II°/III° members were allconsidered to be “apprentices” to that Master. Also each Order kept strictly toitself. Other Setians could not knowwhat it was doing or participate in it at all. RKB’s own Order, the Order ofAnubis, became in effect the “secret elite”of the Temple. Anubians routinely knew about RKB’s thoughts and plans for theTemple as a whole long beforeanyone else even the Council of Nine. The result was a Temple fragmented intouncooperative and suspiciouscliques.Again right after Set-IV I shook this rug out quite a bit. Since then Orders maywork internally on matters ofspecial interest to them, but the products of their wisdom are expected to beeasily accessible to the entire Templevia open newsletter subscriptions, open Conclave presentations & meetings, etc.Order members are not expected tobe “apprentices to the Grand Master”, but are rather free agents with a commonfield of interests and specialties. Noone Order is a “privileged” one, and certainly no Order has higher or earlieraccess to Temple policy informationthan the Council of Nine or the Priesthood of Set generally.Well! All of this seems so clear in hindsight, doesn’t it? It was not soapparent when the Temple of Set was firstexperimenting with Xem, nor with the II° test, nor with RKB’s Order system. Imyself thought each was a good ideain its original form, and so did most other Setians. As things gradually gotscrewed up over a period of time, it wasconfusing to be caught somewhere between the initial, positive impressions andthe developing negative realities.As I look back on the period of stress and crisis which came to a boil at theSet-IV Conclave, I can point myfinger at a number of individuals who by then were clearly conspiring to usurpthe Temple for their selfishaggrandizement. I was disgusted at such profaning of a sacred trust then, andremain so today.However and I respect the prerogative of others to disagree with me on thispoint I do not consider RKB a“traitor” of this type. I think that his is the classic case of the Curse of aMagus overcoming his Task made moretempting by the powers of the High Priesthood of Set which were at hisfingertips. [The Temple learned from thistoo, and after Set-4 we rewrote major sections of the By-Laws to prevent suchconcentrations of authority in thehands of any one official.]The Task of a Magus is to Utter [define, explain, demonstrate] his Word. TheCurse of a Magus is that such aWord, being outside the philosophical “universe” of existing initiates, will bealien to them, hence [at least initially]unintelligible and incredible.You see why Magi get heartburn easily particularly when they themselves mustfirst grapple with the “blindingflash” of the Word in question, as Anton LaVey referred to it. As a Magus whohas been through this “blindingflash”, Task, and Curse myself, I am often wryly reminded of a comment by themusician Miles Davis: “I’ll play it foryou first and tell you what it is later.”In a sense Anton screwed up the Church of Satan when he took his Word to apersonal and selfish extreme, andthe same could be said of RKB. We can condemn the unfortunate result; I think,however, that we would be arrogantindeed to condemn the Magus in question for daring to set out upon such anuncharted and hazardous journey.Ultimately the Temple of Set is better for the RKB era, per the aphorism: “Thatwhich does not kill me makes mestronger.” And I continue to consider Xem an authentic V° Word within the Æon ofSet. As with any V° Word, it hasextraordinary and unsuspected power. If you use it wisely, it can do greatthings for you. If you fiddle around with itcarelessly, it can do not-so-great things to you.- 339 -A54: The Set-2 International Conclave- from the Scroll of Set, August 1980Set-II and XemSet: This was Surely Home- by Constance L. Moffatt III°Set-II was a most magical and magnificent experience for all who attended.Almost every Setian present whohad attended Set-I made comments to the effect that this second InternationalConclave had something that lastyear’s did not have. One of the prime reasons was probably the initial fact thatwe were at home, on sacred ground,at XemSet.Most of us had also grown magically and metaphysically in the year’s time, andthis was very evident in ourdiscussions - both formal and informal - and in our workings. Since most of ushad met in the past, or becomeacquainted through correspondence, we greeted each other like long-lostrelatives and felt quite comfortable andrelaxed alone with “our own kind”. On a mundane level the surroundings wereexquisite, and the tremendous workand love that went into preparing for our stay were extremely visible.The first official get-together was a hospitality room at the motel, hosted bythe Khaibit Pylon. It was here thatmany friendships were renewed.The caravan of cars left for XemSet at 9:00 the next morning; there all wereonce again greeted by MagusRonald K. Barrett and Priest Ricco Zappitelli, the official hosts of Set-II.After coffee and homemade coffee cake, thefirst Conclave meeting was called to order in the shade of giant trees. A mostmoving tour of XemSet followed. Thebeauty and symbolism of the land and its artifacts were explained by MagusBarrett.Even Setians must eat. And who knows better how to prepare for such activitiesthan Priest Zappitelli and hishelpers from the Bay Area? After a spread of food fit to feed an army, themeetings of the Order of Set and the laymembership were held in separate locations (XemSet is comprised of 20 acres,which gave us lots of room to movearound in). While Magus Barrett, assisted by Magistra Lilith Sinclair (officialcoordinator of the Conclave),conducted the III°+ gathering, Adept Chuck Weiss led the I°/II° meeting.If we thought lunch was massive, we were not prepared for the evening dinner.Priest Zappitelli and his teamoutdid themselves, with literally tons of various kinds of fried chicken and allthe good things that go with it.Compression for the separate III°+ and lay membership Solstice workings began atdusk. The magic of theworkings that took place, this reporter does not feel can be adequatelydescribed herein. Words would appear to betoo insignificant and trite. Allowed one word, my own personal one would be“love”.Saturday morning allowed us to sleep in, see the town, or linger over brunch inUkiah prior to the 11:30 AMdeparture, via caravan, for the mountain. After doughnuts and coffee, the groupbroke up for two separate meetings- the Order of Xepera and the Priesthood with the lay membership.After a 3:30 break, the entire group assembled for an open forum with topicalpresentations, questions, andanswers. Priest Zappitelli displayed the plans and drawings for improvements andexpansion of the Court of the OldOnes. Priest Phil Folkler spoke about the Tarot work being carried out byMagister Lee Norton, who was unable toattend Set-II. Priest Robert Moffatt passed around photos he had taken of theTarot paintings already finished byMagister Norton. Having seen them in person, I can only say that photos cannotdo justice to their breathtakingbeauty.While some of the membership prepared for the evening’s hamburger and hot dogcookout, Magistra Sinclair,Chairman of the Council of Nine, held a meeting of the Council. Dinnertime wasanother feast. Priest Zappitellicannot possibly outdo himself next year - even with lasagna. Potter Valley-grownand -fed beef is non-surpassable,and the salads: fantastic. The Khaibit Pylon is offered applause for much ofthis.Preparation for the General Conclave Ritual was outlined and carried out to thefinest detail by Magus Barrettand all Setians present. Every Setian had a part in the elaborate and beautiful(another word) torchlit procession upthe long, winding path to the Court of the Old Ones.The black night was brisk and the sky clear with millions of stars. We were inour own domed world with theAncient Ones. The experience was one none of us will ever forget.Once again we were treated to the wonderful occurrence of witnessing the ComingInto Being of a Master of theTemple, Robert A. DeCecco. All who know Magister DeCecco know his greatness andlove him; thus there weremany tears of happiness. Many of us also sensed Xeper within each other, andthere were more tears of joy for all.The Decompression was one which left most of us not wanting to leave XemSet.Sunday morning came all too soon, as we gathered at the Coach House in Ukiah fora delicious brunch and morediscussions. Farewells did not come easy to any of us; nevertheless we went awayfrom the mountain with filledhearts and strong beings.- 340 -A Lay View of the Set-II Conclave- by Corey S. Cole II°The Set-II Conclave, held July 19-22 at XemSet, was an exciting and magicalexperience. I am sorry for thosebrothers and sisters who were able to attend only in spirit. I noticed someprofound differences between this year’sConclave and the previous one in Windsor, and they are perhaps indicative ofjust how far the Temple has evolved inthe last year. We had our fair share of mundane problems, but magic was the key.Friday we could only go uphill, and did - to XemSet. The day was filled withmeetings and discussions, enhancedby the sacred atmosphere of the mountain; the wolves seemed to recognize ourSetian natures and observed most ofthe activities approvingly.The Order of Set met up near the house, while the lay members discussed magicalnames and neters on thelower patio. It was fascinating to hear the background behind some of the laymembers’ names and how they hadgone about choosing [or being chosen by] them. We had a good mixture of thosewho felt their names were trulyexpressions of themselves, those who were merely using a name as a magical tool,and a few who had not yet foundnames with which they could be comfortable.At Adept Chuck Weiss’ (Phoenix’) suggestion, we decided to devote the eveninglay working to the discovery ofnames for those Setians who as yet had none. The working had a very powerfulfeeling to it, and was quite successfulon the whole. By the time we made our way back down the mountain, everyone wasnamed.The highlight of the Conclave to me was the Temple-wide discussion, whichfeatured the High Priest asking oneor more individuals of each degree a series of questions relating to theirmagical development and “beliefs”. The keypoint that came out was that we do not have “beliefs” at all - we haveknowledge.Some other points from my notes: The Temple is progressing even as are theindividuals within it. Before wehave time to adjust to what we have Become, we have already started to Becomesomething higher.The Temple, being built around change rather than stasis, is continuallyrevolving around and changing its axis.Even as we follow the spiralling path of Xeper, it is changing under our feet.As to Xem, “the only way one can knowXem is to Become Xem”.We also had some discussion of the nature of each of the degrees: “As the Æonprogresses, so do thesophistication and definition of each degree.”The Setian I° is one of the Elite of the Earth, someone who senses the“otherness” within himself and has chosento take an act of will, and of change, in joining the Temple.The Adept II° is precisely an “Adept” magician; he has obtained a good workingknowledge of traditionalmagical symbolism and has become a magical “technician”.The Priest of Set III° has used his power to begin to explore the Dark Realm,and in so doing has had anexperience by which he undergoes a major transformation and receives the Gift ofthe Black Flame. He has found anew realm of Being.Saturday night culminated in the Temple of Set working in the Court of the OldOnes high atop XemSet. Thetorchlight procession up the hillside marked, in my eyes, the end of being heldback by the Satanic psychodramaapproach to ritual; the rest of the working became more and more individual.I would be astounded to hear of any two Setians who came away from that ritualhaving seen and experiencedthe same things. The new way required much more work and personal will, but tomy mind shows the vast strideswe have all taken in one “short” year.Coming down again after all that was terribly difficult. We had a fine buffetbrunch in Ukiah, and nobody quitewanted to say goodbye. I recorded my feelings of the weekend in a ritual, “TheRite of the Self”, then proceeded toSan Francisco to “stretch” the Conclave a few days with some of my Setianfriends and brothers. The spiral is trulytightening. Xeper ir Xem.__________________________________________We are the Significance of the Temple of Set- by Robert H. Moffatt III°“We are going to make this the most magical Conclave that anyone has everattended,” said Magus Ronald K.Barrett, High Priest of Set, in his welcoming address at the Set-II Conclave;and the participants proceeded to makeit just that.The pervading theme in all meetings, small group discussions, rituals, andcombinations thereof, seemed to bethat of recounting and celebrating personal, individual change, with all aspectsbared proudly.All reports from participants were to express that the experience was a giantstep in their evolution. Myimpressions can be summed up in the way the final Conclave Ritual seemed toconduct itself as a separate force - anenergy-composition made up of the place XemSet, the Beings, and the awesomesymbolism.Each occurrence gave individual messages, elicited individual responses, andprovided individual change forgrowth. I felt a great sense of loss for those of the Temple of Set who were notpresent.- 341 -Unlike the grand ritual at Set-I, where heat was a problem, the chill in the airsharpened awareness during thatof Set-II and promoted the sharing of body heat. The best opportunity for thiscame with the Recognition of a newMaster of the Temple, Robert A. DeCecco, who became the center of a swarm ofjoyful friends._________________________________If There is a Constant, it is Change- by Ronald K. Barrett V°, High Priest[The following is a transcript of a talk by the High Priest of Set at the Set-IIConclave at XemSet.]The Temple of Set: Is it a collective, or is it an individual response?As Magistra Bast pointed out, the Temple, before the organizational aspects ofit come into play, begins in theindividual - every individual seated here. We are each a temple of theSet-entity; we are also each a stone in acollective Temple.The difference between the Temple we comprise and other temples which haveexisted throughout history isthat our “axis” is in a state of perpetual change because of the Words that arethe motivating force behind our reasonfor being.Ours is not a temple of stone intended for permanence. Any individual whocomposes even a small part of theTemple of Set who is not geared for flexibility and change will crumble as theTemple itself changes its axis.In all our discussions on aspirations, growth, and Xeper, the hardest concept wehave had to deal with is theelement of change.That element of change began in every one of us before we ever entered theTemple of Set. Think back: Everyone of us experienced something of a search within ourselves, a looking forsomething else, a feeling that there’s gotto be more than getting up, going to work, going home, and then starting allover again.So the first thing that each one of us has to contend with in the design of theTemple of Set is the element ofchange. If there is a “constant” in the Temple, that is it!Then comes the overall picture, the collective direction: Xeper ir Xem: Becomeof the gods: Become HigherMan. It sounds great. It sounds beautiful. It’s great poetry. And almost everytheological and philosophical societyon the face of this Earth has said that this is what it is trying to do in oneform or another.Even the Christians, whom we rib so often, seek to become pure in the eyes oftheir God so they can reap thereward that he offers: eternal bliss.What’s the difference between the Temple of Set and everyone else? One majordifference is, as I have said, theacceptance of the element of change - the welcoming of it.Another factor is unqualified individuality: individual expression, individualgrowth. We don’t tell you whatyou have to do, as in an outline. We simply say: “In order to get from point #Ato point #C, you have to reach point#S. How you do it is entirely up to you. Nobody is going to hand you a roadmap.”What we are trying to do is not just talk about becoming gods, not just talkabout various forms of higher being,not just write fancy papers on one philosophical subject or another. We aredoing it, and there’s the difference. Weare saying it works.We’re saying that we do not prescribe any step along the way that someone beforeyou has not takensuccessfully. Thus we can erase the element of blind faith. We can say, “Well,we do have faith, but it’s faith byexperience.”You want to see those who have mastered themselves? I can show you Mastersthere, there, there, and there(pointing to Masters Sinclair, Thomas, Seago, and Bast).Our relationship with the entity with whom we work is different. We have apersonal relationship. The entityneeds us every bit as much as we need him. And there’s a beauty in that too,because we can all say, “Myarrangement, my affiliation with Set is mutual. We are both in it for selfishreasons. I salute him only so long as hedoes things for me, only so long as he enlightens me.”And, of course, our usefulness to him is reciprocal. We work together; thisgives a little more significance to theidea of “becoming of the gods”, because we are truly working with the gods - notserving them, not working underthem.So the goal of the Temple of Set is to provide an initiatory path not to someheavenly godhood where you have todrop dead in your tracks to realize your reward - not to where you have toforfeit your identity to get there, butwhere you have to realize your identity to get there - where “selfishness” isnot a bad word. But it’s an art; it’s ascience; it’s an exact science. You get exactly what you put into it.Let’s review those steps of initiation. Setians I° come into the Temple forpersonal reasons. The true reason theyshould be here is that they have sensed this “otherness”, this potential withinthemselves, and want to find a way todevelop it. And they have met another Setian, and, through discussion with thatSetian, they think that we may havea way to help them develop this thing within them.So the first step is an act of will that is the first act of change, and thatchange will not cease. The change that hasbegun at that point is a continuous, ongoing thing. There is no time to makeserious adjustment to any stage ofchange. We simply Become, and then we are what we have become while we areaspiring to become more.- 342 -We have another tool in the Temple called the communications pyramid. Thepyramid is a magical tool, amagical structure. It is designed as a device to get us from the dilemma of ournatural human existence into the stateof godhood which is, as Setians, our rightful heritage. But we have to claim it.We have to do it. It won’t be handed tous. Somewhere along this initiatory path lies the state of Xem. The state of Xemis a realm of existence unlike thatwhich we presently know. The only ones who will truly know Xem are those whohave Become it. For this reason itcan be described as one might describe an ancient Egyptian temple - by walkingaround the outside of the templecomplex without having any real idea of what is on the inside or why.What I am trying to lead up to is that we must look at the Temple of Set as aspiral path leading to a higher stateof being. Even while it is doing so, the path is itself changing. Nothing everbecomes familiar. We don’t stick aroundin one spot long enough for that to happen. And if we are going to accomplishthis, our first important task is tobegin really believing we are who we say we are. We all believe that the Templeof Set is the vehicle that is goingto get us to Xem, or we would not be here. Right?If that is true, we have another responsibility, regarding not only ourselves aswho and what we say we are, butthose others among us as who and what we say they are.Consider what you are saying when you approach a Master of the Temple andaddress that IV° being as“Magister” or “Magistra”. You are recognizing a true Master of this initiatorypath. And even the Masters have toremember this, when they address each other - that they are addressing otherMasters.Think of this when you are addressing a member of the Priesthood - one of whomSet himself has said, “I Electthis one to work the Black Magic.” If there is anyone here who is not awed by aperson who has been chosen by thePrince of Darkness, that person can leave now.And when you see someone wearing a red medallion, someone who has pulled himselfout of the muck and mireof humanity and has said, “Yes, I will attempt to master the forces that arearound me, and bend the naturaluniverse to my will”, how can we but hold the most profound respect for such aperson?And then we have one who wears the white medallion of a Setian I°. Here is anindividual who has said, “I reallydon’t know anything about this ‘Temple of Set’ except what they say they are,and what they have written; butthere’s something inside me that says there’s something solid about this -there’s something real about this. Andyes, I’ll take the chance, and I’ll investigate this organization of what forall I know could turn out to be a bunch ofsadistic weirdos.”Think about it: a Black Magic organization! No Setians knew exactly what theywere getting into when theydecided to join the Temple of Set, and yet the drive in them was so strong thatthey said, “Yes, I will take this step.”Who among us cannot respect such an individual? Who among us does not want tohelp this individual realize moreof his own potential?This is the value of the Temple of Set. This is the only value. The Temple is atool for us to use. Without use,without utility, it has no value - it is a thing of no meaning. Set himself hasno need of an organization just fororganization’s sake. He needs no worshippers. He does not need an elaboratetemple structure in which to rumbleand make it thunder. We are the significance of the Temple of Set. For thatmatter, we are the hope of allhumanity. Those of us who are here are the sum total of the whole Setianexperiment.So when we regard each other, let us do so in the true sense of initiatoryfellowship. Let us regard each other asthe present and potential beings that we are. Let us work together collectively,even as we work individually, to sopropel this Temple of Set that we go into “warp speed”. It’s up to us. Set can’tdo it for us.- 343 -A55: Reading Requirements for the II°- by Ronald K. Barrett V°, High PriestJuly XVI/1981Required Reading for Setians I°1.Magick by Aleister Crowley.

Aquino VI°High Priest of SetJune 10, XVII/1982To all Initiates of the Temple of Set:On May 31 Ronald K. Barrett, High Priest of Set and a recently (May 20)confirmed Ipsissimus V1°, sent a letterto the Masters of the Temple in which he announced his complete resignation fromthe Temple. It was a decisionwhich he had not discussed with anyone in advance - save certain members of hisOrder of Anubis - and for whichhis letter offered no explanation:Please honor my desire for an honorable, quiet, graceful, and quick exit by notattempting to contactme, as it will only be futile, since I am absolutely resolved about this courseof action. I am equally resolvednot to discuss this further than saying “This is my Will!”As soon as Magistra Lilith Sinclair, Chairman of the Council of Nine, learned ofthis development, she proposedto the Council that I be reconfirmed as High Priest of Set, and the Councillorsapproved this unanimously. Sincethen I have been taking immediate action to see the Temple through thisdevelopment. The purpose of this letter isthreefold: (1) To state my analysis of the Barrett resignation for the record.(2) To make the entire Temple aware -perhaps I should say re-aware - of some basic principles of its design. (3) Tomake a certain promise.The Barrett ResignationSince Barrett chose not to explain himself, his actions must speak for him.Indeed, as far as I am concerned, theeffect of his actions is more important than any statement he could makeconcerning his intentions, magical orotherwise.So it must always be with those of high standing and office. They are accordedsuch honors and trusts preciselybecause they are distinguished, wise, and prudent. Lesser beings may behaveimpulsively and irrationally and evendestructively, and perhaps no one will comment - save to show the offender thedoor.But, like Anton Szandor LaVey, Ronald Barrett is no ordinary being. We cannotjust shrug him off, sweep himunder the rug, and forget about him. We must judge him: hold him to account forwhat he has done - not to intrudeupon his new private life, but rather “for the record” within the Temple of Set.For the last several days I have listened to much speculation within thePriesthood. Now I feel that I must go onrecord with my own evaluation - both because I am High Priest and because I amalso the individual whoRecognized Barrett to the III°, IV°, V°, and VI°. Here it is, as simply andbluntly as I can phrase it:• As High Priest, Barrett envisioned a Temple of Set in which Initiates would betrained according toexacting, standardized criteria. They would have to pass proficiency testsaccording to a uniformtime-schedule. It was not conceivable that someone could stay at, say, the II°level indefinitely; allmust move higher, and the goal was the V° for everyone. As the Initiate advancedin degree, hewould be confronted more by tests and problems relative to Xem (Barrett’s V°Word) and Per-t(Magus Norton’s Word). Unlike my own Word ( Xeper), however, Xem would not bedirectlyexplained. Rather one would have to apprehend its meaning indirectly, throughvarious writingswhich contained both literal and symbolic meanings.During the period of Barrett’s High Priesthood, however, signs began to emergethat things were not as well asthey might be.• The membership of the Temple began to shrink to half its size upon Barrett’sassumption of office -both from above as various senior Initiates left, and from below as fewernon-members made thedecision to affiliate.• The “Pyramid system” of communication that Barrett instituted - in whichcommunication wasrequired and senior evaluation of juniors was mandatory - failed because bothseniors and juniorsbalked at the requirements.• A test which Barrett wrote to standardize proficiency for the degree of AdeptII° resulted in all II°sflunking.- 347 -• When it appeared that no members of the Priesthood III° intended to take thetest voluntarily,Barrett required them to do so - within a short time limit. He was disappointedat the results, butsaid to Magistra Sinclair that he could not inactivate the entire Priesthood. Irecommended that hesimply table the results of the examinations until the Set-4 Conclave (this nextmonth), whereuponthey could be discussed constructively and a consensus reached concerning theirsignificance.Barrett agreed to do this.• A week or so before Barrett’ s surprise letter another event occurred. He wasvisited by Ricco A.Zappitelli, one-time Priest of Set and very close friend who had disgracedhimself at the Set-3Conclave last year and had since been a non-member of the Temple and estrangedfrom Barrettpersonally. A short time later Susan Mitchell, who works with Barrett in hisoccult shop, wasadvised by another ex-III° who had left in disgrace - Susan Wylie - that she andZappitelli had beenreceived warmly by Anton LaVey and been given priesthoods by him.I am not suggesting that Zappitelli brought Barrett a “deal” from LaVey, or thatBarrett wouldhave considered it if he had. I am suggesting that such news probably depressedand discouragedBarrett all the more, particularly since he had held great hopes for Ricco’ssuccessful emergencefrom psychiatric care and eventual return to the Temple.• At the Spring Equinox of this year Barrett introduced a new Temple-wideprogram - “OrderWithout Law” - in which he announced that the Temple would henceforth besubdivided intovarious initiatory Orders, each headed by one of the Masters of the Temple IV°.All Setian I°s andmembers of the Priesthood III° [all II°s had been demoted to I° by the test]would be required tobecome “apprentices” in these Orders. Authority would be highly centralized inthe person of theIV° heading the Order:All Apprentices will respond and answer to their Sages [IV°s] in any/all Setianmatters.It would be an act of Unwisdom to carry any matter outside the Order to whichtheApprentice belongs without first having consulted the Sage of that Order ...III°s may assistthe Sage in the Apprenticeships of I°s of that Order and administratively to theII°s of thatOrder (as per the By-Laws), but henceforth only under the direct supervision ofthe Sage.On paper “Order Without law” seemed to curtail the freedom of Setians tointeract - and membersof the Priesthood to use their powers of supervision and Recognition - withinthe Temple as awhole. But in the same document Barrett said:Nor will an attitude of ‘us and them’ be tolerated from members of the Orders orfromthe Orders themselves. Expulsion from the Temple of Set will be certain tofollow suchnoticed attitudes.Since “secret cliques” have been responsible for many a crisis in the history ofthe Temple - and inthe Church of Satan before it - Magistra Sinclair and I were concerned enoughabout this particularpoint to discuss it with Barrett personally at his store while he was stilldrafting the policy. We werealso concerned that his own Order of Anubis might receive his preferentialattention to the possibledetriment of his High Priesthood responsibilities. To both questions he answeredthat we hadnothing to worry about, and we took him at his word.Upon his resignation the entire Order of Anubis - less Priest Robert Brink -also resignedwithout discussion or explanation, save to sing in harmony that “it has nothingto do with Barrett’sresignation”.The High Priesthood is regarded so highly in the Temple of Set that it has beenvirtually inconceivable to doubtthe integrity of the incumbent. True, I wrote provisions into the By-Laws toremove a High Priest from office [toprotect the Temple against an Anton LaVey-type disaster], but the exchange ofinformation among the Priesthoodhas always been so open that we never really worried about a “Watergate“.I think it is also correct to say that, as Barrett introduced the above-citedpolicies, everyone made a good effortto interpret them in the most positive way and to help them off to a good start.Most of the problems seemed to betime-pressure ones or occasional lapse of communications rather than seriousdoctrinal ones.That, at any rate, was how it looked from here. While Barrett was putting hissurprise letter in the mail, I was atwork updating the Temple Reading List - with all the new Order material added toit per input from all of the Sages[except Barrett - but I assumed he was too busy and planned to take hisrecommendations from Scroll #VI-6].• A further point to consider is that, barely a week previously, Barrett hadreceived the highestRecognition in the Temple of Set - that of Ipsissimus VI°. Per the By-Laws thisrequires theunanimous consent of all of the Masters of the Temple and of the entire Councilof Nine. So Barrett- 348 -was hardly in a position to say that the Temple of Set - at all levels - did notrespect or appreciate hisexpertise.These, then, are the facts. From them I conclude that Barrett was becomingincreasingly frustrated by theTemple of Set’s reluctance to mold itself into his ideal conception of it, andthat he saw its decreasing size (36) assymptomatic of its impending demise. Rather than suffer the embarrassment ofbeing in office as High Priest whenthat happened, he decided to jump ship, taking his Order of Anubis with him. Infact he is certainly intelligentenough to have expected that his sudden, unexplained departure would probably soshake the Temple that its death-agonies would commence - several months of struggling, perhaps, but an eventual,inevitable disintegration.Having admired, loved, and trusted Barrett for so long, many of the Priesthoodhave found it hard to imaginesuch Machiavellian motives in his case. I myself was so stunned at the news thatthe only thing I could think of wasto ask him if he would at least accept an Honorary Membership in token of ourregard for him. [He refused this laterby a two-sentence letter.] After considering the aforementioned facts, however,I feel that this interpretation is thecorrect one.Some members of the Priesthood have speculated that Barrett, having achieved theVI°, has left in search of“new initiatory heights” beyond those of the Temple of Set -and/or that he hasdeliberately “pushed the Temple outof the nest” to force it to learn to fly, i.e. to evolve into the new and moreadvanced initiatory realm in which he nowexists. I can understand why such hopeful, grasping-at-straws speculationoccurs, but I do not share it for thefollowing reasons:“VII°+ Initiation”The Temple of Set’s philosophy of initiation has always been very simple andstraightforward. It is to clear upthe mysteries of existence, not to further obscure them by occult doubletalk.[This no-bullshit approach issomething we inherited directly from the Church of Satan, I might add.]Advancement through the II° is purely rational [see the Crystal Tablet andincluded Reading List now in themail to you].Advancement to the III°, in its simplest terms, is by estimation of an IV° thatyou display the uniquecharacteristics by which Set Recognizes his Priesthood. Advancement to the IV°is by consensus of the Temple’ssenior Initiates that the III° has become so expert, sensitive, and judicious inthe control and application of hispowers that he should properly be considered a Master.The V° and VI° are essentially variations upon the IV° level of expertise andconsciousness. They do not denote“higher levels of consciousness” in any sense.Note that one’s personal development is unrestricted at any degree. A II° maybecome tremendously wise in theways of magic without ever displaying that peculiar combination of qualitiescharacteristic of the III°. [Last year Ireceived the missing ingredients for a Temple working of key importance from aSetian I° whose knowledge of theEnochian system’s origins was greater than mine.]The IV° has been regarded as the “summit” of personally-activated initiation,because the V° and VI° areproperly seen as “freakish” or “accidental” occurrences.Masters of the Temple IV° do not cease to develop just because they Understandthe known universe. First ofall, they are constantly accumulating more “lesser” facts which enhance theirUnderstanding. Secondly, as Adeptmagicians they have the power to create magical universes in accordance withtheir will - and do so. Their quality ofUnderstanding manifests itself in the excellence and precision of thesecreations.The II°, moreover, is the last degree at which personally-oriented workings areconsidered sufficient. AllInitiates to the Priesthood of Set are expected to concern themselves to areasonable extent to the teaching of newer,junior Initiates - as an active manifestation of the Priesthood in its mostsacred sense. All Masters of the Temple areexpected to concern themselves to a reasonable extent with the excellence of theInitiatory climate of the Temple asa whole.Hence Ronald Barrett had no reason to feel constrained or stifled in hispersonal initiatory desires by his IV°+state of being. His titles of Magus and Ipsissimus, like my own, are ofrelevance to Æonic magical “office” only. Hecould have resigned the High Priesthood, remained a VI°, and soared on to morepersonal degrees than even theMasons can conceive. The Temple of Set would have no right to judge such things,nor would Barrett have the rightto expect such judgment.Instead he resigned his affiliation entirely - including in this act all degreesRecognized by the Temple as well asthe sacred Priesthood of Set itself. Moreover, charged by Set with the sacredcare of his Temple as its High Priest,Barrett did not relinquish that office in a fashion designed to ensure itssmooth transition to a successor. Instead ofconsulting with the Council of Nine, giving it advance notice of his intentions,and remaining in office until the nextHigh Priest could be chosen after reasonable discussion and installed in office[at this next month’s conclave, forexample], he departed the office so abruptly that a condition of crisis wasinevitable and immediate.- 349 -“Testing the Temple”My answer to this is short, sweet, and blunt: The Temple of Set does not playgames - magical, psychological, orotherwise - with its Initiates of any degree. Our manipulative/ Lesser BlackMagic is reserved for the profane world.Within the Temple straight questions get straight answers; and the sincerity,intelligence, and dignity of otherInitiates are always respected. This is a code of ethics which applies to VI°sand I°s and everyone in-between.Relative newcomers to the Temple may not know this, but we feel especiallyvehement on this matter becausethe final downfall of the Church of Satan occurred when Anton LaVey made adecision to exploit all but a select fewof the Church. I was among the select few, but wouldn’t stand for his decisionand so spoke for the Infernal Mandateon that point. [Barrett, I may say with irony, was not among the select few ...nor, for that matter, were RiccoZappitelli or Susan Wylie. Memories appear to be short.]Within the Temple, therefore, any misleading of Initiates, now matter how“therapeutic” or “well-intentioned”,has always been anathema. Clearing up the mysteries of the universe is hardenough without wondering whetherour co-investigator is setting us up!And the High Priest is expected to make all policies or seriously-anticipatedpolicies known to the Council ofNine [at minimum] at least at the earliest point in time anyone else hears ofthem. [Magistra Sinclair, Chairman ofthe Council, was put in the humiliating position of being scheduled to learn ofBarrett’s decision by letter - whilesome of the Order of Anubis people that she talked to by phone evidently knew ofit - and of her ignorance - inadvance. [This is the same Lilith Sinclair, I feel moved to add, who welcomedRonald Barrett I° into her Grotto inNew York City so many years ago and watched with pride as he attained the II°.]Summarily I deplore the circumstances and evident rationale of Barrett’sresignation from its chief executiveoffice, which I consider not unlike stabbing the Temple of Set in the back withthe expectation that it would bleed todeath in the street.I reject absolutely the notion that he was initiatorily constrained by theTemple’s degree structure.I reject absolutely the notion that he had any right or precedent to supposethat he could “test” the Temple witha shock such as this.Rather I assess his motives simply as self-centered and clique-oriented - nodifferent, in final analysis, fromothers in the past who, finding the Temple of Set too large a pond with too manybig fish, left to became theacknowledged big fish in a smaller pond. Barrett is, to be sure, the first oneto toss a stick of dynamite into the bigpond where the many fish were relaxed under his “guardianship”.While you have been reading this - particularly those of you who are recententrants into the Temple - you mayhave been wondering why I should spell all this unpleasant and unflatteringinformation out to you. Most otherreligious and/or magical organizations would do a gloss-job, put on the bestface, and hope that they wouldn’t losetoo many members who could see through the paint.As I’ve said earlier, the Temple of Set isn’t like that. Our senior Initiatesare people who’ve spent years diggingthrough mounds of occult bullshit and pseudo-science in search of the realPhilosopher’s Stone. We have suffered acertain amount of social ostracism, even persecution because of our interestsand dedication. But we also have afierce pride in our integrity, and no one is going to monkey with it.A side aspect of this is that any individual who entrusts his initiation to theTemple has the right to know thequality of the initiators. The privacy of the Priesthood and Masters of theTemple is respected as long as theirexecution of office is in keeping with the Temple’s established reputation. If aproblem emerges, the facts arebrought out in the open to all who are involved in any way. In the case of thesudden resignation of a High Priest,obviously, the whole Temple has the right to know what is going on. Q.E.D.High Priest PoliciesSince reassuming the High Priesthood, I have made specific policy decisionswhich I consider to be ofimmediate and urgent importance:• All degree-downgradings which took place because of Barrett’s test arereversed, and use of that test(in whole or in part) becomes just one of many ways for magical knowledge to bemeasured. Wordhas circulated that just about everyone did rotten on the test. I received allthe tests from Barrett afew days ago, together with the corporate papers. I haven’t reviewed them indetail, but from aquick skim-through they’re not that bad and most are impressive. We’ll discussthem more at theconclave. Some of the essays really ought to go to the Scroll for example, sothat the entire Templecan benefit from then.• “Order Without Law” is revoked as a mandatory system. Masters of the Templemay establishspecialized Orders of their own [indeed this has been a traditional prerogativeof the degree sincethe Æon of Horus], but they are not required to do so.Initiates of the Temple may affiliate with one or more Orders as they wish to[and as will acceptthem], or they may choose to remain Initiates of the Temple in general.- 350 -The title of “Apprentice” will not be used as a qualifying designation to anyTemple of Setdegree.The authority of supervision and Recognition empowered to the Priesthood of SetIII°+ underthe By-Laws will not be circumscribed in whole or in part, by explicitrequirement or by tacitexpectation, by any Order.In short, the Orders are both welcome and encouraged as they lead to moreenrichingexperiences for all members, and as they are both instructive and pleasant forMasters and otherInitiates alike. Oppressive and constricting Orders, I expect I hardly need add,are not welcome andwill most assuredly be discouraged.• And now one point - straight from the By-Laws - that I cannot stress tooemphatically: No Temple-germane secrets are to be kept from any member of the Council of Nine. This isalso one of thehistoric emphases of the Temple.I don’t give a damn what promises you have made to whom. If you’re hiding someimportantinformation from a Councillor, and you know [Setians tend not to be stupid] thatthe Councillorwould be interested in it, you’re in trouble with this High Priest when I findout about it.The Council of Nine, in addition to being the corporate Board of Directors ofthe Temple, is thesovereign authority of the Temple. It does not make policy - the High Priestdoes that - but itwatches that policy, him, and the Executive Director to ensure that all is as itshould be. Obviouslythe Council cannot do this if it is in the dark. Nor should its dignity beoffended by Counselors beingeven “passively” misled [as Chairman Sinclair was when talking with Order ofAnubis persons].Temple of Set policies and programs for the present and future will be discussedin great detail at the conclavenext month, and Setians of all degrees will have a chance to be heard and tohave their recommendationsconsidered. If you cannot be present, put your ideas in writing and send them toany member of the Priesthood whois planning to attend. Standing Temple-wide policies will be clarified inappropriate supplements to the CrystalTablet of Set, and more specific and time-dated programs will be discussed inthe Scroll of Set.My PromiseFinally the promise: In 1975, during the writing of the Book of Coming Forth byNight, I pledged to Set that Iwould recreate his Temple and his Priesthood in their highest, noblest essence.Every decision I have made sincethat night, organizational or initiatory, has been made with that pledge inmind.So powerful has been the energy that has radiated from the Temple of Set that ithas accomplished thingsabsolutely unequaled and unprecedented by anything remotely resembling it. ItsInitiates have unlocked gates tothemselves and their prerogatives whose existence they could scarcely haveimagined.Yet this has not been without cost. Seemingly without end the Temple hassuffered shock after shock - both fromoutside persecution and, more sadly, from those whose dedication to initiationwas disrupted by lesser motives. Ithas built up a host of enemies - in conventional society, who instinctivelysense its authenticity [hence threat to falsereligious and philosophical antics], within the “occult community” (groups whoseethics, expertise, and axioms arepathetic and simplistic in comparison), and among disgruntled ex-Setians whofind its continued presence anintolerable reminder of their own failures and weaknesses. Not daring tochallenge the Temple of Set directly, suchindividuals and organizations circle about it like vultures, probing forvulnerabilities and recruiting its rejects andfailures (like Zappitelli and Wylie) with mock titles and positions.Ronald Barrett’s resignation is the worst shock yet. I have no reason toanticipate that the Temple of Set will notsurvive it, just as it has withstood so many others for so many years. But if itever should seem - either now or atsome other time - that the Temple’s strength is falling, then it will not becast aside to die wretchedly, gasping out itslife slowly and painfully while those who fear it and hate it assemble to gloatover its agonies. Rather, like the fabledsword Excalibur, It shall be returned with dignity, honor, and Essence to theSource from whence it came, awaitinga third moment in a far future when some restless beings who seek the ultimateMystery will again evoke its ComingForth by Night. Xeper.- 351 -A57: Xem and Per-t: From Magic to Mysticism- by Michael A. Aquino VI°High Priest of SetThe Scroll of SetAugust 1982The critical events prior to, during, and following the Set-IV Conclave are nowso well known throughout theTemple of Set that it is unnecessary to recount them here. It is important,however, that the magical consequencesof those events be evaluated. The disgrace of Ronald Barrett and Lynn Norton issignificant in that these twoindividuals were recognized as Magi V° by the Temple, hence were acknowledged tohave made significantbreakthroughs in the magical and philosophical principles of the Left-Hand Path.Something, however, went very badly wrong. What and why? And what are theresultant implications for theTemple?For the first two years of Barrett’s High Priesthood (mid-1979 to mid-1981), hisUtterance of the Word Xem wasin keeping with the traditional climate of magical and philosophical freedomthat had characterized the Temple ofSet since Xeper: that is, the Word was expected to stand on its own merits, andno one was forced to concentrate onit. Barrett was a strict High Priest, but only insofar as Temple protocol andadministration were concerned.This happy state of affairs began to deteriorate, as far as I can determine, atthe Set-3 Conclave a year ago. Onthat occasion Lynn Norton was Recognized to the V°, and Barrett’s attitudetowards Xem underwent a change. Nowit was important that those who had not paid what he felt to be sufficientattention to Xem do so forthwith. This wasto be done by (1) the introduction of a written II° test and (2) theredefinition of the Temple’s degree system to makethe degrees correspond simply to the progression of Magus-Words from Crowleyforward. [Barrett announced thesetwo policies in Scroll #VI-6.]At the time there seemed no particular reason for concern. Barrett’s record wasa good one, and he was the firstto assure Setians that the test was not to be used punitively, nor would it becentrally graded, nor would there be aspecific passing score. It would be used as an aid to evaluation only.During the ensuing year, Barrett altered all three positions. He and he alonedecided passing grades and correctanswers to the often-ambiguous questions on the test. II°s not passing weredemoted to I°. All III°s were forced totake the test with a short time limit when few did so on their own. III°s notpassing the test, said Barrett, should beinactivated until they did. By April 1982 all II°s in the Temple had beendemoted to I° [if they had not resigned bythen], and action against the III°s was halted only by Magistra Sinclair, who asChairman of the Council of Nineinformed Barrett that she would not tolerate punitive actions againstCouncillors merely because of their"},{"pageContent":"performance on the test.Absorbed with the massive project of The Church of Satan history, I was notimmediately alarmed by the test orby the comments concerning the degree system. I trusted Barrett’s integrity, andI assumed that the test problemswere “growing pains” that would be solved constructively. As for thedegree-system, I did not perceive Barrett’sintent as being a change to its underlying structure - a structure so strong andtime-tested that it has enduredformally for a century [since the founding of the Golden Dawn].In a letter to the III°+ on 7/15/81, Barrett commented on the Recognition ofNorton at Set-III:First and foremost is the Coming Into Being of a new Magus V°. I’m not going tosay much about it atthis time until the Recognition has become official, except that I’m delightedand magically elated beyondWords.I will say this however: Xem is no longer only conceptual, for the Coming IntoBeing of Magus Norton(Ptah) has validated one of the Principles of Xem, for the idea has become infirst Manifestation. Xem’s firsttruth is, and through that Xem is!Now the Gates which are open have been passed through, and it is the time of thenew Magi, of whomPtah and I are but the first. Now comes the Great Work. What is more and veryimportant is that the Curseof the Magus is broken; it is no more.More on all of this will be explained later, but in the meantime Magus Nortonneeds time to get a gripon what is happening and on a Per-t; I need time to get the reality of all thisinto my brain; and he and Ineed time to put our Words together for the first phase in the construction ofthe new realm. Soundexciting? You might say that.I was concerned about this odd notion of the Curse of the Magus being ended, andfurther about what I hadheard - but not read as policy - that “now everyone could attain a personal V°”.I decided that I had best remind bothBarrett and Norton of the seriousness of the concept of Magus. To Norton [with acopy to Barrett] I wrote on7/25/81:- 352 -From many of the Masters I have heard accounts of your Utterance of the Word ofa Magus. While I wasnot fortunate enough to be present at the Set-3 Conclave, I respect theirUnderstanding and your own senseof Coming Into Being as expressed both at the Conclave and in your 7/13/81letter.As was also the case at the time of my own and Anubis’ V° initiations, I do notthink thatcongratulations would be magically appropriate. While the path from I° to IV° isone of increasing exaltationand satisfaction, the V° is, like Satan’s fabled fall from Heaven, a plunge intoan entirely new environment.The Magister Templi can be an explorer, a teacher, a philosopher. All thesepleasant pursuits are shatteredfor the Magus, as he must be a creator. That is his Task, and therein also lieshis Curse:And this is the horror that was shown by the lake that was nigh unto the City ofthe Seven Hills,and this is the Mystery of the great prophets that have come unto mankind,Moses, and Buddha,and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus, and Osiris, and Mohammed; for all theseattained unto thegrade of Magus, and therefore were they bound with the curse of Thoth. But,being guardians of thetruth, they have taught nothing but falsehood, except unto such as understood;for the truth maynot pass the Gate of the Abyss. - 666, 6th Æthyr, The Vision and The VoiceI know that there is a good deal of excitement and interest in the Temple at theprospect of witnessingthe Coming Into Being of a new Magus. It is a rare and sublime occasion, and itis all the more stimulatingbecause of its mystery. A Magus presents the magical universe with a new unknownfactor which necessarilyalters many, if not all preconceptions about the initiatory process. Witness theenvironmental changes fromCrowley to LaVey to myself to Anubis.You must recognize, however, that this initial excitement and interest on thepart of onlookers is inignorance of what your Word will actually imply for them. If this were not thecase - if you fitted neatly intothe existing magical universe, “making it perfect” - then you would not be atrue Magus but rather aMagister Templi who had succeeded, perhaps, in making a major breakthrough inUnderstanding of theexisting environment Then you would not be Uttering Per-t but rather fulfillingXem.I have read carefully Anubis’ #OS-93 comments to the Priesthood on the ending ofthe Curse of theMagus, and a few evenings ago he and I were able to discuss this at some length.I have reflected on what hesaid and the reasoning behind it, and yet I still feel I should counsel cautionand care on this point.If Anubis’ magical universe does not encompass what is meant by Per-t - andagain that is necessarilythe case if Per-t is a true V° Word - then Anubis’ apprehension of Per-t is thatof a Magister Templi [just asmy apprehension and subsequent Understanding of Xem has been that of a MagisterTempli].At this moment, if you are in truth a Magus, no one Understands you but you.That is why a Magusis characterized as Uttering a “falsehood”, and that is why the Curse: Heencounters skepticism and thendisbelief, and then even annoyance and rejection as he insists upon proclaimingthe Word. Yet if he is aMagus, then he cannot help himself; he must continue to proclaim the Word, andthat is the Task of theMagus.Remember that it took our Initiates a long, slow, and often difficult process tomake the magical switchfrom Indulgence to Xeper. Some fell by the wayside. Then it took a similarprocess to make the switch fromXeper to Xem. The word of Nuit - “inertia” - works for the Magister Templi (whostreamlines and fulfills theexisting magical universe) and against the Magus (who expands it and thus altersall preexisting formulæconcerning it).It is most important that you are aware of this inertia distinction. Otherwiseyou might tend to interpretresistance and ignorance concerning your statements as petty, interpersonalantagonism.That was a mistake made by Robert Ethel, who grasped after the V° and found thathe was totallyunable to stand the shock of the cold water after the comforting magical saunaof the IV°. He tried to savehimself by “enforcing” belief in and understanding of the Word he endeavored toUtter; he tried to wrenchthe V° environment into a IV° semblance.The only result was that he made it clear that he was not a true Magus, for aMagus is compelled to seethe distance and distinction between his Word and the preexisting universe. Hestresses it; he does not tryto hide it or disguise it. And then he carries on despite the Curse, for a trueMagus is also identified by hiswillingness to fulfill his Task. As it is written in Liber B vel Magi:And woe, woe, woe, yea woe, and again woe, woe, woe unto seven times be His thatpreachethnot His law to men! And woe also be unto Him that refuseth the curse of thegrade of a Magus, andthe burden of the Attainment thereof.Only you are in a position to know if you are in truth a Magus V°. All others,Anubis and myselfincluded, can only offer you a “best possible” environment to undertake yourTask - which is what the V°Recognition is in actuality.I°-IV° Recognitions are decisions of certainty and validation. The V°, ofcourse, is outside both of theseconcepts. So what the Temple actually does by a V° Recognition is to proclaim tothe entire membership:“This is an Initiate who believes he is a Magus. The High Priest and the Ninesee no apparent reason to- 353 -disallow that claim and, from his statements to date to them, they are of theopinion that the claim has areasonable probability of being true. Therefore they formally agree to Recognizehim as a Magus, that hisTask may be made easier and his Curse lighter for all Initiates will attempt tointerpret him in a unique wayonce they are alerted to the purple medallion.”All these things I say to you now, as I said them less clearly years ago toAnubis, and as I learned themeven more crudely myself years earlier. If you know that you are in truth aMagus, then consider them well,for this is the state of being that you now assume - a state of being attainedby only eleven other beings. Thisis a distinction beyond perfection, for attainment of perfection is acharacteristic of the Magister Templi. Itis a distinction beyond all honor, beyond reward, beyond compensation. Othersmay honor you or they maynot, but you will be a Magus just the same.If on the other hand you know that you are not a Magus that the phenomena ofSet-III and thereafterare IV° and not V°, then I warn you most emphatically not to accept the purplemedallion, for to do so woulddestroy you.The decision is yours, and as you decide, and as the Temple of Set Recognizesthat decision, so I sendyou my encouragement, endorsement, and confidence.Norton answered that he felt himself legitimately a Magus by these criteria.Hence I decided I had no reason tobe concerned for the definition of the V°.Norton’s few communiques to the IV°+ concerning Per-t were vague concerning itsdefinition, but he said thathe was preparing a major presentation and explanation for Set-IV. Probably themost coherent statementconcerning Per-t was written by Magister James Lewis in a 7/28/81 letter toIII°s C. Moffatt, Cole, and Folkler:... Our closest meaning will be “manifestation”, because it is higher man whowill be seen inManifestation through man!Per-t is a refinement of Indulging the Will to Come Into Being as one of theeternally evolving gods. Per-t is an occult (hidden) thing, for it must be an individual work first andforemost before it’s done in concert.The question which comes immediately to mind is: “What will Manifest?” And hereit can get a bitominous, for which of us is 100% free of some flaw, insecurity, or weakness?I’ll be the first to admit that Ihave a few here and there, but I can also state with the voice of experiencethat initiation in Maat purifies.[”Is initiation so horrible?” Yes and no.]At this point I would refer you to Key #1, 7th paragraph: I surmise it ispossible to manifest an anomaly.Read that last again, and then go back to Key #1. Is it a sure thing that amutant would horribly bloom? Notif initiation is used along with an awareness of the self and Maat. And not ifone is constantly, activelyreaching for the higher goals. But it seems it can happen though even a minorflaw is permitted to take root.If this leaves you with a feeling of being at unknown and unmarked crossroads,let me suggest this: Beneither overly optimistic nor pessimistic. Utilize balance. Magister Seago oncesaid: “For years I have beenharping on the necessity of keeping one’s balance.” I personally feel therecannot be too much emphasisplaced on the “balance factor”. It is a basic necessity to living and one of thesafeguards against mutation.Upon Barrett’s surprise resignation from the Temple in May 1982 and myconsequent reappointment as HighPriest, I decided that the II° test and the “Order Without Law” policies asenforced, mandatory systems in theTemple should go immediately. “I do not consider that the intent of thesesystems was bad, or even that thesystems as implemented were total failures,” I said in my first official letterto the III°+ on 6/2. They could beretained as voluntary devices, in whole or part, for intelligent initiatoryusage. I continued:The immediate impact of my policy changes in these areas is to return the Templeto a “maximumfreedom of action and expression” mode as it was in its earliest years. Ingeneral, anything not explicitlyprohibited by the By-Laws is O.K. This presupposes that each and every member ofthe Priesthood will usehis or her powers with intelligence, maturity, kindness, discretion,consideration, openness, courtesy,common sense, and an ever-present regard for the sacred nature of the office heor she holds. As High PriestI intend to seek the greatest possible latitude for you to continue your owninitiation and encourage that ofothers within the Temple’s enhancing systems.Only then were I and the entire Temple of Set to begin to see what an iron clawof dogma Barrett and Nortonhad been designing for the Temple during the past year. Norton and his two Orderof Ptah III°s Folkler and A. Seagoobjected immediately and obstinately to the removal of that claw; and Norton,Barrett, and Magister L.D. Seagocommenced an operation designed to defame me and to obtain the High Priesthoodfor Norton so that the clawcould reassert its grip.No one was more astonished or dismayed to see this than myself. At first I couldhardly believe it was takingplace at all. Then the amount of poison “under the surface” of the situationproved another shock. For the first timein 13 years, I found myself actually having to argue on behalf of my ownintegrity in the Temple. Some III°s behavedwith unprecedented impudence and arrogance - not that Magus Norton and MagisterSeago set a better example forthem. When the poison was finally cut out after two months of agony for theTemple, everyone was badly shaken.- 354 -What was it that made Barrett and Norton create the iron claw and resist itsremoval by every means in theirpower, fair and foul? It was, I conclude, their ultimate failure to accept theTask of a Magus, which never ceases, andtheir decision to redefine Xem and to initially define Per-t not as magicalterms, but as mystical dogma. In TheDangers of Mysticism ( Equinox #I-6), Aleister Crowley wrote:The mystic is solitary and shut up, lacks wholesome combat. We are allschoolboys, and the footballfield is a perfect prophylactic of swelled head.When the mystic meets an obstacle, he “makes believe” about it. He says it is“only illusion”. He has themorphine-maniac’s feeling of bien-etre, the delusions of the general paralytic.He loses the power of lookingany fact in the face; he feeds himself on his own imagination; he persuadeshimself of his own attainment.If contradicted on the subject, he is cross and cattish. If I criticise Mr. X,he screams and tries to injureme behind my back; if I say that Madame Y is not exactly St. Teresa, she writesa book to prove that she is.Such persons “swollen with wind, and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, andfoul contagionspread”, as Milton wrote of a less dangerous set of spiritual guides ...Corollary to this attitude is the lack of all human virtue. The greatestmagician, when he acts in hishuman capacity, acts as a man should. In particular he has learntkind-heartedness and sympathy.Unselfishness is very often his long suit. Just this the mystic lacks. Trying toabsorb the lower planes intothe higher, he neglects the lower, a mistake no magician could make.The fulcrum of the degree system in the Church of Satan and Temple of Set hasalways been the III° - thePriesthood. The non-ordained degrees - the I° & II° - had similarly possessed adignity of their own. Barrett andNorton attempted to reduce all three of these degrees to mere “apprenticeships”,to make the IV° a mere acceptanceof the “mystical” Xem, and to grant a V° to anyone professing a “mystical”Per-t. After complying with my requestfor his resignation, Norton wrote to Priest Whitaker on 7/25:I alone see Xem on a level higher than that of a Master. Second, the nature ofmy Task allows me afurther vision that even an Ipsissimus lacks. Third, creation is the key to themanifestation of Xem, and sofar only I am a working example of this neter.Such blind megalomania is the fate of a Magus who refuses the Curse thereof, asadmonished by AleisterCrowley in the previously-quoted passage from Liber B vel Magi. Mystics Barrettand Norton and those whoworship at their feet have effectively cast from themselves the true essence ofmagical initiation.The Masters of the Temple must now consider whether the pre-Set-3 concept of Xemmay retain its standing asa V° Word despite the fall of the Magus who Uttered it. As for Per-t, it is nowapparent that it never was more than amystical fantasy, clothed in the dignity of a V° Word by Norton and Barrett andaccepted as such by a trustingTemple.As Barrett’s Recognition to the VI° proved a mockery due to his prior, secretdecision to reject the Temple, soNorton’s V° is revealed in the cold light of day as a mistake honestly andsincerely accepted by the Temple, but amistake nonetheless.I can offer no better epilogue to the aftermath of Set-IV than the Book of Satan#II-12 from the Satanic Bible:Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results to be but an empty fiction, let itbe unceremoniously flunginto the outer darkness, among the dead gods, dead empires, dead philosophies,and other useless lumberand wreckage!- 355 -A58: Secrets of the Vehm- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #I-3 (November 1983) & #II-6 (November 1984)Order of the TrapezoidThe heritage of the Order of the Trapezoid extends back through various secretsocieties and Orders of the non-Mediterranean, northwest European tradition. It would be misleading, however, tolump the Order of the Trapezoidwith every pagan, Druidic, or “Odinist” movement which may have existed in thepast. The Left-Hand Path issignificant by its focus upon the unique, personal psyche, not upon submergenceof the conscious self in pagannature-worship. [Initiates of the Order may study this distinction in somedetail in Franz Winkler’s For FreedomDestined.] Hence we focus much of our research on the Ahnenerbe (the secretmagical organization within theinfamous SS), the turn-of-the-century Thule Gesellschaft, and the medieval Vehm.Information concerning any ofthese organizations is very difficult for the outsider to uncover, but the O.Tr.has access to archives whose existenceis scarcely known to conventional historians and academics. Much of ourinformation concerning the Vehm comesfrom archives of the Ahnenerbe concerned with the history and significance ofthe Wewelsburg in Westphalia.The Wewelsburg Castle is built on the site of ancient Saxon fortificationsdescribed in the Annals of the Saxons.Ahnenerbe archæologists estimated those fortifications to have been used in KingHenry I’s defense against theHungarian invaders in 930, but their first reliable dating comes from 1123, whenan anonymous chronicler reportedCount Friedrich von Arnsberg to have constructed a stone stronghold over theSaxon ruins. In 1301 the Bishop ofPaderborn Otto von Rietberg acquired the territory from the Counts von Waldeck,who had built a new stone hall onthe Wewelsburg. Archbishop Theodore von Fürstenberg constructed the presentcastle in 1604-7. It was damagedheavily by Swedish artillery during the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) and hadfallen into serious neglect by 1815,when the North Tower was struck and nearly destroyed by lightning. When the SSacquired the Wewelsburg as itsinner sanctum in 1933, it was the North Tower that Heinrich Himmlerreconstructed and remodeled as the“Mittelpunkt der Welt”.Directly above the subterranean Hall of the Dead/“Walhalla” (location of theXVII/1982 Wewelsburg Working)is the Marble Hall ( Marmorsaal), a circular chamber constructed by Himmler toreplace the original chapel of thecastle. There has been much speculation concerning the design and purpose of theMarble Hall [as has also been thecase of the “Walhalla”]. Not until my visit to the castle for the WewelsburgWorking did I gain access to documentsand other information clearing up much of the confusion and mystery.The peculiar design of the Marble Hall is inspired by the controversial Hall ofthe Grail which Alfred Roller (setdesigner for Max Reinhardt - see my Church of Satan, Chapter #24) created onAdolf Hitler’s orders for the 1934Parsifal at Bayreuth. Set in the center of the red Italian marble floor is ablack/green marble disk from which extendtwelve Sig-runes sinister (left-handed, bending like the letter “Z”). This odddesign has usually been explained bybewildered scholars as a “solar glyph”, but in fact it is one of the secretsigils of the Westphälischen Femgerichte,better known as the Vehm. The Marble Hall was thus created to serve a dualpurpose: that of shrine for the Grail [ofwhich more remains to be said] and of formal court for the deliberations of theSS’ most esoteric affairs. Original SSblueprints for the North Tower reveal the Marble Hall itself to be a chambereventually to be concealed beneath theplanned main ceremonial hall for the tower, the Gruppenführersaal (SS-Generals’Hall). On march 31, 1945 theWewelsburg was blown up on Himmler’s orders to prevent its secrets from fallinginto the hands of the Allies. SS-Major Heinz Macher, holder of the Knight’s Cross with Oak Leaves, succeeded inburning out the entire castle -except for the Marble Hall and the Walhalla, whose 20.6-meter stone/concretewalls resisted destruction.The Vehm did not yield its secrets easily, even to the Ahnenerbe. Many myths andlegends have grown uparound its “secret tribunals”, most of which portray it as an evil shadow onancient Westphalia (something akin tothe Sicilian Mafia or American Ku Klux Klan). Sir Walter Scott’s House of Aspenand translations of Goethe’s Götzvon Berlichingen exemplify this approach, as does the most recentsensationalistic treatment by Nigel Pennick inHitler’s Secret Sciences. In actuality, however, the Vehm represented almost theonly guarantor of justice during themost anarchic period of German history, and its proceedings compared favorablywith those of other systems ofjustice in medieval Europe.To understand the phenomenon of the Vehmgerichte, one must first know somethingabout the political andcultural climate in that period of medieval Germany.The Emperor Charlemagne (r. 771-814 CE) devoted some 30 years to a war againstthe Saxons in the north,finally conquering them in 785 [Pennick’s dates ion #14M are in error],destroying the sacred column of Irmin, andforcing them to accept Christianity. Some 14th/15th century writers, such as theDominican Henry of Hervorden,attributed the creation of the Vehm to Charlemagne as a governing device.Henry’s account is the apparent source ofPennick’s dating of the Vehm to 772, but there is no confirming evidence of Vehmaction prior to the 13th century.Medieval Westphalia was somewhat larger than the present-day German province ofthat name. It generallyembraced the “red earth” lands of old Saxony, between the Rhine and Weser, southto Hesse and north to what istoday Holland. After Charlemagne’s conquest this region began to sufferincreasingly under Viking raids, mostpronounced during the reign of Louis “the German” (843-876). Louis responded byaccording greater authority tothe Dukes of Saxony, the first being Count Ludolf of Gandersheim. One of themore famous Dukes was the first of- 356 -the Saxon kings of Germany, Henry I “the Fowler” (919-936), whom HeinrichHimmler would later claim as aprevious incarnation. Henry drove off an invasion by the Magyar Hungarians in933, and his character wasromanticized by Richard Wagner in the opera Lohengrin.After the reign of Henry III “the Black” (1039-1056), there ensued periods ofinstability and insurrection innorthern Germany, with a succession of comparatively weak Dukes and rivalwarlords holding regional powerinterspersed with strong monarchs, most notably Frederick I “Barbarosa”(1152-1190). The death of Conrad IV in1254 brought about the “Great Interregnum” (1254-1273) that marked the end ofthe medieval Holy Roman Empire.There followed a period of relative weakness in the monarchy until 1493, whenthe accession of Maximillian Ibrought the Hapsburgs into power.It is therefore not surprising that the first historical record of the Vehmdates to 1267, when Engelbert, Count ofthe Mark, freed one Gervin of Kinkenrode from the feudal obligations of hisinheritance of Broke in the County ofMark, pronounced at Berle in a court in the presence of the Vehmenotes(initiates of the Vehm). In 1280 theVehmenotes are mentioned in another document, following which there are manyrecords of their activities andinstitutions.Like “Baphomet”, the origins of the term “Vehm” are clouded in mystery andantiquity, and Pennick shies awayfrom a definitive explanation. Order of the Trapezoid sources includesuggestions that its roots come from Fahne(standard), Femen (to skin), Fehde (feud), the Latin Vemi ( væ mihi = woe isme), the northern Ve or Vnem (holy), the old German Vitte (prudence), Vette(punishment), the Salic law Fimmiha, and/or the Swedish Fem/ IslandicFimm (five = the number of judges in a Vehm court). Most probably it derivesfrom the Latin Fama (fame),referring to the Vehm’s prerogative for summoning persons to justice on groundsof their infamous reputationsalone, without an accuser being required. Fem is moreover an old German term for“condemnation”; hence suchcourts could loosely be titled “criminal courts”. Alternately they were calledSecret Tribunals ( Heimliche Gerichte),Silent Tribunals ( Stillgerichte), or Forbidden Tribunals ( Verbotene Gerichte).[In some of the old records “Acht”appears in place of “Gerichte”.]Each tribunal of the Vehm was presided over by a Stuhlherr (tribunal lord, lordof the seat [of judgment]), whosometimes appointed a Count ( Freigraf) to preside in his place. Next to theCount were the Assessors ( Schöppen),divided into knights and commoners since according to feudal custom one could bejudged only by one’s peers.By the 14th-15th centuries, from which come the only reliable Vehm records, some100,000 had been initiated.After their initiation Schöppen were called Wissende (“those who know”) orVehmenotes. For his initiation beforethe Freigraf, each Schöppe would appear bareheaded for questioning, then kneelwith the thumb and forefinger ofhis right hand on a sword and an execution-rope and utter the following oath:I promise on the holy marriage that I will henceforth aid, keep, and conceal theHoly Vehm, from wifeand child, from father and mother, from sister and brother, from fire and wind,from all that the Sun shineson and the rain covers, from all that is between sky and ground, especially fromthe man who knows the law,and will bring before this free tribunal, under which I sit, all that belongs tothe secret jurisdiction of theemperor, whether I know it to be true myself or have heard it from trustworthypeople, whatever requirescorrection or punishment, whatever is Vehm-free (i.e. a crime committed in thecounty), that it may bejudged or, with the consent of the accuser, be put off in grace; and will notcease to do so for love or for fear,for gold, silver, or precious stones; and will strengthen this tribunal andjurisdiction with all my five sensesand power; and that I do not take on me this office for any cause other than forthe sake of right and justice;moreover that I will ever further and honor this free tribunal more than anyother free tribunals; and what Ithus promise will I steadfastly and firmly keep, so help me God and his HolyGospel.The secret sign of the Vehm - the solar “wheel” later to be inlaid into thefloor of the Grail Hall of theWewelsburg by Heinrich Himmler - was then communicated to the new initiate.[Pennick’s recounting of allegedsecret signs such as the initials “SSGG” and a dagger turned towards oneself ona table are unsubstantiated by O.Tr.sources.]Initiation into the Vehm brought with it both the duty and the right to trackdown criminals and bring them tojustice before a Vehm court - or to execute them immediately if caught in theact. Those outlawed or Vervehmt bythe court were hanged on trees, not gallows, to demonstrate the Vehm authorityto carry out its sentences anywherein the land.Throughout Westphalia agents of the Vehm operated freely, since the populaceknew that injury to a Vehminitiate would result in the offender’s certain death. Similarly abuse of theVehm oath was virtually nonexistent,since the Masters of the Vehm knew that the Order’s success depended upon thepopulace’s perception of it as adispenser of justice, not a means of persecution. Death was the penalty forbreaking the Vehm oath, and ÆneasSylvias, secretary to Frederick III (1440-1493), wrote that no one had everbroken that oath. The Vehm he went onto describe as “grave men and lovers of right and justice”, a characterizationgenerally echoed by other chroniclers ofhis time. The picture emerges of a system of what Americans would call “frontierjustice”, administered byrepresentatives from a number of social classes all sworn to secrecy andintegrity, owing nominal allegiance to theGerman feudal monarch but in fact assessing each case on its particular merits.In point of fact each Germanemperor, at the time of his coronation at Aix-la-Chapelle, was also initiatedinto the Vehm by the Count ofDortmund.- 357 -Exempted from Vehm concern were clergy, nobles of ducal or higher rank [becauseof the difficulty of providingpeer judgment at such levels], women and children [because of their sex & age],and heathens & Jews [because oftheir unworthiness]. Otherwise those accused of acts forbidden by the Vehm -such as murder, adultery, rape, andtreason - could be summoned before the nearest court to answer the charges.Those who refused to appearvoluntarily were declared vehmbar and were thus subject to immediate seizure byany tribunal.Vehm courts were usually held in the open under an Oak tree [as againillustrated in Act I of Lohengrin] andgenerally in the morning as is customary with German courts. Legends of secretVehm “inquisitions” insubterranean castle-chambers at midnight are tantalizing but unsubstantiated. Infact Vehm courts differed fromInquisitional proceedings in a number of features, including the judges’inclination towards mercy, the right ofappeal to higher Vehm courts, the right to be heard and to present witnesses inone’s own defense, and a generallyunbiased trial atmosphere. Appeals were heard once a year, at the Vehm Ordercourt which met at either Dortmundor Arensburg.There is no reliable date for the termination of the Vehm’s activities. As acreature of necessity it grew ininfluence to provide for justice where none existed, and as the Hapsburg Dynastygrew in strength and jurisdiction,the necessity for the Vehm faded away. Within another century it had become thestuff of legends, and todayknowledge of it is all but nonexistent.Why should the O.Tr. regard the Vehm as one of our earliest predecessors? Notbecause we are cruel, becausethe Vehm was not excessive in its deterrents or punishments given the violenceand callousness of the middle ages.But perhaps because it took a solitary stand for justice at a time when neitherchurch nor state insisted upon it, andbecause it considered justice not just a social convenience but a sacred duty,to whose service a sacred oath would besworn. At a time when many other areas of Europe were ravaged by outlaws,brigands, robber barons, and corruptfeudal monarchs, Westphalians could breathe free and walk their land withoutfear. For this the Vehm deserves anhonorable mention in history. Profane historians may disdain it, but the ghostsof its initiates may raise their mead-horns in the halls of the Order of the Trapezoid.- 358 -A59: Project Star Gate: $20 Million Up in Smoke and Mirrors- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #II-2, March 1984)Order of the Trapezoid[ The original title of this article in Runes was “ESP and the ElectromagneticSpectrum”. I later revisedand expanded it for publication under the “Project Star Gate” name in TheIntelligencer: Journal of U.S.Intelligence Studies , Volume 11, Number 2 - Winter 2000 of the Association ofFormer Intelligence Officers(AFIO). It is reprinted here in that version. ]For some time now I have trudged through the wilderness of ESP, like Diogeneswith his lantern, searching forbedrock amidst all of the Uri Geller stage magic and Jeanne Dixon tabloid fluff.The nonsense that still appears in“respectable” print never ceases to amaze [and amuse] me - for example Targ &Harary’s Mind Race (1984). Targ isa Stanford Research Institute physicist who says that he has worked for a decadeon a “multi-million-dollar programof psychic research financed by the Defense Department and intelligenceagencies” - retitled in 1995 “Project StarGate”.Targ’s pet project consisted of “remote viewing” experiments, on which I waseventually briefed at the StateDepartment. It was an eyeball-roller, not only because the statistical data SRIoffered proved nothing, but alsobecause the transmission of visual information to the brain simply doesn’t occuroutside the visiblespectrum. Light-waves from the central fountain in Washington Square Park(alleged to have been “seen” by oneof Targ’s subjects) are atmospherically diffused long before reaching Palo Alto,California.There’s much we don’t know about the brain’s internal design, but howinformation travels into and around it isno mystery at all. Electricity - the same stuff that makes flashlights work.Please note that the electrical impulsesrocketing around in your head are extremely weak: To light a flashlight bulb youwould have to generate about 30million times your present level of brain current.Fascinating experiments in ESB (Electrical Stimulation of the Brain) have beendone by Dr. José Delgado ofYale University. Delgado’s probes, using tiny amounts of current, were capableof changing moods, stimulatingmemories, and even causing motor actions despite the conscious will of thesubject to resist. If the human brainwere not well-insulated against external electricity [which it is], you wouldhave an explosion of utterly arbitrarythoughts every time you drove under a high-tension wire or scuffed your shoes onthe carpet.Reality check time:(1) Coherent visible light waves (a visual “picture” of something) don’t travelthrough theatmosphere without progressive distortion and disintegration. “Remote viewing”at theextreme distances claimed flatly violates the laws of physics.(2) Unamplified electrical brainwaves can’t be picked up past EEG electrodespasted ontoyour body. Just as obviously they don’t jump between heads, much less acrossrooms or entirecountries. And even the EEG detection of a brainwave is far too crude to pickout a specific thought ormental image.If the Pentagon and the intelligence community did in fact blow $20 million on“psychic” snake-oil, P.T.Barnum and Harry Houdini must be rolling merrily around in their graves.So what if anything is possible in this field? How and why?The electrical energy in your brain occurs in waves measured according to cyclesper second (CPS). 1-3 CPS =delta waves, characteristic of deep sleep. 4-7 CPS = theta waves, characteristicof high emotion, violence, andfrustration. 8-12 CPS = alpha waves, characteristic of meditation, relaxation,and “searching for patterns”. 13-22CPS = beta waves, characteristic of frontal brain activity, deliberate effort,and logical thought.We’ll come back to brain waves in a moment, but first a word about anotherprinciple: resonance. Resonanceis a very interesting concept and deserves a precise definition:(1) a vibration of large amplitude in a mechanical or electrical system causedby a relatively small periodicstimulus of the same or nearly the same period as the natural vibration periodof the system.(2) the intensification and enriching of a musical tone by supplementaryvibration that is eithersympathetically or mechanically induced.In the course of my research I examined the work of Dr. Nikola Tesla, one ofrecent history’s more charming“mad scientists” who rattled the cage of “recognized” science with, among otherthings, experiments in resonance.Biographer Margaret Cheney relates in Tesla: Man Out of Time:- 359 -He attached an oscillator no larger than an alarm clock to a steel link 2’ longand 2” thick. “For a longtime nothing happened, but at last the great steel link began to tremble,increased its trembling until itdilated and contracted like a beating heart, and finally broke.” Sledgehammerscould not have done it, hetold a reporter, crowbars could not have done it, but a fusillade of taps, noone of which would have harmeda baby, did it.Pleased with this beginning, he put the little oscillator in his coat pocket.Finding a half-built steelbuilding in the Wall Street district, 10 stories high with nothing up but thesteelwork, he clamped theoscillator to one of the beams. “In a few minutes I could feel the beamtrembling. Gradually the tremblingincreased in intensity and extended throughout the whole great mass of steel.Finally the structure began tocreak and weave, and the steelworkers came to the ground panic-stricken,believing that there had been anearthquake. Before anything serious happened, I took off the oscillator, put itin my pocket, and went away.But if I had kept on 10 minutes more, I could have laid that building flat inthe street. And with the sameoscillator I could drop Brooklyn Bridge in less than an hour.”Now a little-known but interesting fact is that brain-waves are subject to theprinciple of resonance.Energy-waves reaching your brain through any medium - eyes, ears, or flesh -will tend to induce your brain-wavesto cycle at the same wave-length. A common example of visual resonance is theseizures that some peopleexperience when exposed to a light flickering at 10 CPS.The audio spectrum - being the range of sound vibrations which human hearing canconsciously detect - is from15 CPS (bass) to 20,000 CPS (treble). The infrasonic range - 10-15 CPS - is toolow to be consciously detected but isnonetheless capable of inducing resonance in the brain. Below infrasound [andsometimes encompassing it] areExtremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves, which are powerful and durable enough totravel through the Earth forcommunication with submerged submarines.The relaxation which you paradoxically feel when listening to the deep, heavythrobbing of drums or bassguitars at rock concerts is the same as that felt by American Indians listeningto the large dancing-drumsaccompanying their ceremonial campfires. Resonance is produced which inclinesyour brain-waves towardsalpha, and if the rate of the beat seems particularly pleasing to you, Irecommend that you take your pulse. My guessis that it will be close (somewhere around 70 CPM), which your system will findsubconsciously soothing. [If youwish to calm a crying infant, rock its cradle at about that speed, or hold it toyour breast so that it can hear thebeating of your heart. Try it!]Theta happens to be a very curious range. Soviet research into PK phenomenaalleged that PK activity isgenerally associated with a sudden surge of theta activity at the 4 CPS level.Theta activity is also more common inthe brains of young children than in those of adults, which may have somethingto do with the rumor (which Icannot call more than that) that “poltergeist” activity is usually catalyzed bythe presence of a child in the house.Particularly during the post-World War II era, American and Soviet intelligenceagencies weren’t very clubbyabout exchanging any information, and especially not research indelicate/sensitive areas like mind-controltechniques. On the other hand there was a lively dialogue on psi between Westand East in civilian scientificcircles, much to the anxiety and annoyance of Green Door types.Here in San Francisco Michael Murphy, founder of the famous Esalen Institute inBig Sur, and his associateSteve Donovan created the Transformation Project, a mammoth database of files -rooms and rooms of meticulousfile cabinets in those pre-desktop-computer days - to correlate the world’sresearch on ESP. Murphy had dialoguedextensively and exhaustively with Soviet ESP scientists, traveling widely in theUSSR throughout the 1970s, andwrote up the results up in thinly disguised “fiction” such as An End to OrdinaryHistory (1982).Via the Transformation Project file library, I was able to review vast amountsof records and published resultsof various government and university experiments in the field of ESP from boththe Western & Eastern Blocs as wellas non-aligned countries. The range and scope of the TP files went far beyondanything in the intelligence agencyand Defense Department libraries on this topic.One of the most rigorous and conclusive analyses was conducted in 1977 by E.Balanovski and J.G. Taylor of theDepartment of Mathematics, King’s College, London. The TP files containeddetailed reports of their findings,including an extensive article in Nature magazine #276, November 2, 1978.After having reviewed previous experiments attempting to test ESP for EMemission, B&T declared theirdissatisfaction because of imprecise test conditions, exclusion of parts of theelectromagnetic spectrum (EMS), andinadequate write-ups of the results. They determined to cover the entire EMS,and to do so under the most rigoroustest conditions possible.The battery of sensors they assembled included skin electrodes, electrometers,magnetometers, loop antennae,crystal detectors, horn antennae, thermocouples, electric thermometers, infrareddetectors, and ultravioletdetectors. Many of these sensors overlapped one another’s frequency range, andaltogether they covered the entireEMS from 0 to 3x105 GHz! As can be imagined, before the first experiment couldbe conducted, extensive test-running of all these sensors had occurred in order to record and filter out theirrelevant EM “noise” in the test areas,including passing cars and TV/radio station broadcasts. Readings were recordedon strip chart recorders, video taperecorders, and direct photographs of oscilloscope and frequency analyzerscreens. The efficiency of this battery ofdevices was quickly evident:- 360 -Needle-Rotation: (2 subjects, 2 controls, 92 trials) A needle was suspended byan extra-fine nylonthread inside a clear perspex cylinder which was clamped securely to a nylonbench. Movement wasachieved by the subjects moving their hands and wrists back and forth around thecylinder at about 5 cmfrom it. In each of the 12 sessions the subjects produced a 60° average rotationof the needle, sometimes upto 200°. We established that a rotation of 50° was produced by a potential of 2mV with respect to earth atfrequencies 0-1 MHz. For up to 60° rotation, skin electrode measurements on 2earthed subjects indicated askin potential of only 0.2 mV. We concluded that the rotation could not becaused by E or H fields from 0-1MHz produced by the subject’s body. When an anti-static ointment was rubbed overthe surface of thecylinder, the whole phenomenon vanished, indicating that the effect was due tocharge induced on theneedle from the outer surface of the cylinder. The VTR showed the subjectsinadvertently touching thesurface of the cylinder in their attempts to move the needle. Further testsshowed that the amount ofrotation produced was directly correlated to the amount of charge on the outersurface of the cylinder.“ESP” rotation of a straw atop a glass of water inside a glass dome was tracedto convection current inside thedome produced by the heat of a nearby electric heater. No EM activity wasdetected. “ESP” rotation of a compassneedle was also EM-free. The amount of rotation was then found to decrease withincreasing distance between thecompass and the subject’s body according to the inverse square law. It alsodecreased when steel sheets wereinserted between the subject and the compass. Conclusion: electrostatic chargeonce again.Uri Geller Dept.: When hooked up to the array of sensors, metal-benders provedto be 100% unable to bendmetal, either by contact or at a distance. When the attached sensors wereremoved, there were some apparentsuccesses - but the remote sensors still detected no EM signal:Attempts were made to cause bending of a strip of metal or plastic by feeding EMenergy into the strip.A Paradynamics 10 GHz X-band microwave source was used (50 kW peak power, 0.6 or2.1 microns pulse,variable p.r.f. with external modulation). Strips of various metals, plastic,and various crystals wereirradiated, and vibration of the specimens was observed at the modulationfrequency in agreement withsurface acoustic wave generation. Strips of aluminum, copper, and brass cut tolengths appropriate to theinternal modulation showed resonance effects (at 1-3 KHz) when inserted into thewaveguide of the X-bandsource. Although energy was thus absorbed in the strips, no bending everoccurred.The results show that no unusual EM emission from the subject’s body wasobserved over the entirespectrum. If there had been low frequency signals, they could not account forthe phenomenon. First, theirfocusing power is very poor. Second, the energy transfer is inefficient. Third,the signal levels observed aretoo low by a factor of about 109 to explain the effect. The best candidate wouldbe the microwave range 1-5GHz; at these frequencies the focusing power is good and the energy transfer canbe efficient for thegeneration of surface acoustic waves, as the skin depth in metals at thesefrequencies is negligible. But nomicrowave emission higher than the black-body radiation at the human bodytemperature was everdetected. Microwave radiation emitted by the body corresponds to a power levelof 10-14 W. Therefore EMradiation cannot explain the apparent metal-bending occurring in the absence ofthe contact and televisionsensors.The full sensor array further detected no unusual EM radiation during attemptsat “psychic healing”, andstatements by “healers” and “patients” alike of heat sensations were notverified by any of the temperature sensors.No unusual EM activity was detected during dowsing experiments either. Dowserswho claimed sensitivity tomagnetic fields down to 10-5 G were tested and found insensitive to the presenceof 100G!Contrary to 1995 media stories, word of U.S. government dalliance with ESPactually leaked out in the early1980s. In Mind Wars (1984) Ronald McRae, a Jack Anderson associate clearlyhaving a great time with the “ProjectStar Gate” antics, observed:In the ’70s the Navy signed a $50,703 contract with SRI to determine whetherpsychics could detect remote EMsources. Yet the Navy flatly denies that it has “ever used psychics to tracksubmarines”. It describes one psychicantisubmarine project as an “investigation of the ability of certain individualsto perceive remote, faint, EM stimuliat a noncognitive level of awareness”. SRI delivered the final report in 1978,claiming success with several psychics.McRae continued that, “despite its denials, the Navy has thus far employed atleast 34 psychics to track Sovietships and submarines”, and a number of psychics - like “Madame Zodiac” ofWashington, D.C. - dutifully troopedforward with stories of nervous, chain-smoking Navy officers hunched over theircrystal ball tables while awaitingword from Beyond of the location of the nearest Soviet sub. McRae quotedpop-occult sociologist Marcello Truzzi, towit: “Psychic powers might have extremely important military and politicalconsequences should the enemy be ableto use them to break through national security defenses.” Woo, woo.The Army first flirted with this particular snipe-hunt in 1980, when an articleon “psychotronic warfare”appeared in Military Review, the journal of the prestigious Command & GeneralStaff College. This was anotherGomer Pyle “gaw-ul-lee!” article with absolutely no hard evidence to back it up.Not to be outdone by the Navy andMadame Zodiac, however, the Army in 1984 launched a 5-month experiment calledProject Jedi. Named after theStar Wars movie knights who were able to perform exotic mental/magical feats,Project Jedi sought to use- 361 -neurolinguistic programming (NLP) as a new way of teaching recruits to fireweapons. This was done throughpsychological analysis of the thought-patterns of expert shooters as they fired.23 soldiers were then trained to fire,some according to the NLP “guided imagery” and others per conventionalinstruction. Training time was reducedalmost by half for the NLP group.In 1985 forty soldiers undergoing Russian language training were divided intotwo groups, one of which wastrained according to a technique called “Suggestopedia”. This involved TaiChi-like calisthenics, followed by mentalrelaxation & breathing exercises, followed by “guided imagery” a la ProjectJedi. The bottom line was nyet:“Suggestopedia” didn't work.There were, however, still more psychic fish to fry. In 1985 The Armycommissioned a two-year, $425,000report from the National Research Council, an agency of the National Academy ofSciences. Among the topicsreviewed were stress management, biofeedback, accelerated learning,psychokinesis (PK), extra-sensory perception(ESP) and dear old “remote viewing”.On December 8, 1987 the NRC report, entitled Enhancing Human Performance, wasreleased. It concluded thatmost of the unconventional techniques were “scientifically unsupportable”, butthat sleep-learning, guidedimagery, and “super learning” programs were viable.Obviously this didn’t even slow “Project Star Gate”, which rolled merrily alongtaking the taxpayers on its $20million “remote viewing” amusement park ride. For a final nail in the coffin of“remote viewing” we turn again to theB&T series of experiments:Tests on human sensitivity to low levels of EM radiation: Five subjects wereseated in a roomwith either a loop antenna or a horn antenna placed 50 cm from them. The sourcewas in an adjoining roomto avoid visual or auditory cueing, conscious or unconscious. The sources usedwere a tunable RF source inthe 220-950 MHz range with a power output of 1 mW and a tunable MW source (bothpulsed and CW) inthe 6-17 GHz range with a power level of 5 mW. The switching on or off of thesource was randomized bytossing a coin, the level of success according to chance thus being 0.5. Thesubject was then asked to sensethe source being on or off. The results were not significantly different fromchance.Telepathy/Distant Viewing: We only investigated integrated power levels, asenough power has tobe radiated before a signal can achieve its desired effect, whatever modulationthe signal may have. Weinvestigated three subjects who claimed telepathic abilities and one who claimeddistant-viewingcapabilities [in which a subject is supposed to be able to describe accurately aremote site without beingphysically there]. No unusual EM signals were detected, nor were the subjectssuccessful in telepathictransmissions.We have tried to detect EM signals emitted by people, and in particular theFourier spectrum of suchsignals, to test the reality of ESP phenomena. All experiments failed to yieldany unusual EM radiation. It ispossible to conceive transmission of EM energy from one person to another, or ofemission by one person ina manner undetectable by the apparatus we have used. This would have been so ifvery brief pulses of EMenergy were used in such signalling with times less than the response time ofthe corresponding apparatusat the frequency used. There are no known mechanisms in the body able to producesuch signalsat the power levels required to produce the effects. We have also found thathumans areinsensitive to low levels of EM. A possible mechanism for such signalling istherefore clearlyruled out for telepathy and distant-viewing. The EM levels emitted to achievemetal-bending [in themicrowave range to achieve the desired focusing] are joules, and there is noknown mechanism in the bodyto achieve a peak power output of GW; it is difficult to suppose that this wouldbe possible without severetissue damage.Bottom line: By itself the human brain can neither send nor receive the stuff ofwhich specificthoughts are made - save through the media of the physical senses. Thereforeextra-sensory perceptiondoes not occur, nor do purely mental efforts to produce physical effects(psychokinesis/PK). “Successes” in thesefields are either coincidental, the results of non-mental physical phenomena(magnetic fields, gravity, etc.), ordeliberate deception by clever stage-magic trickery a la Uri Geller and MadameZodiac.The principle of resonance as discussed above is not invalidated, however. Eventhough EM waves may not bedetectable by human consciousness, they can still affect human brain-waves byinducing resonance at similarcyclical rates. So the possibility of subconscious, resonance-triggered changesto one’s general mental state ( alpha,beta, theta, or delta) remains.Psychological Operations specialists know that it is the conscious mind whichmust be reached for opinion orbehavior modification, and that it is reached reliably and predictably throughthe normal communicative senses.Similarly the mind expresses itself through these same senses, and through mediatechnology we have developed amultitude of ways to amplify and transmit such expressions. Communicationbetween minds is no longer theproblem; it is the content of that communication and the ethics underlying itwhich challenge us, particularly asold nation-state, ethnic, cultural, and social standards continue to mutate inthis final decade of the 20th century.- 362 -Update 2010University of California, Irvine Press Release - August 13, 2008Scientists to study synthetic telepathyResearchers get grant to develop communication system based on thoughts, notspeechA team of UC Irvine scientists has been awarded a $4 million grant from the U.S.Army Research Office to studythe neuroscientific and signal-processing foundations of synthetic telepathy.The research could lead to a communication system that would benefit soldiers onthe battlefield and paralysisand stroke patients, according to lead researcher Michael D’Zmura, chair of theUCI Department of CognitiveSciences.“Thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speechrecognition and in brain imagingat other universities to research a brain-computer interface with applicationsin military, medical and commercialsettings,” D’Zmura says.The brain-computer interface would use a noninvasive brain imaging technologylike electroencephalography tolet people communicate thoughts to each other. For example, a soldier would“think” a message to be transmittedand a computer-based speech recognition system would decode the EEG signals. Thedecoded thoughts, in essencetranslated brain waves, are transmitted using a system that points in thedirection of the intended target.“Such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send andreceive messages,” D’Zmurasays. Initially, communication would be based on a limited set of words orphrases that are recognized by thesystem; it would involve more complex language and speech as the technology isdeveloped further.”D’Zmura will collaborate with UCI cognitive science professors RameshSrinivasan, Gregory Hickok andKourosh Saberi. Joining the team are researchers Richard Stern and VijayakumarBhagavatula from CarnegieMellon University and David Poeppel from the University of Maryland.The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Defense’s MultidisciplinaryUniversity Research Initiativeprogram, which supports research involving more than one science and engineeringdiscipline. Its goal is to developapplications for military and commercial uses.- 363 -A60: Dark Deco- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #II-4, July 1984Order of the Trapezoid[ This article was later reprinted in The Sophisticate , Journal of the Art DecoSociety of California,Autumn 1984; and then in the Los Angeles magazine Antique & Collectibles ,October 1984.]The current interest in Art Deco often tends to be explained as an offshoot ofthe general fascination with 20th-century nostalgia-art. The style’s characteristic features have been explainedby Bevis Hiller (in The World of ArtDeco) as influences from Egyptian and pre-Columbian architecture; an emphasis onstraight lines, tight curves, andsharp angles; and a fascination with speed and streamlining associated with thedawning machine age.What is not so clear is why this particular type of art should exercise theallure that it does. Art Deco is neverregarded with ambivalence; people are either obsessed with it or repelled by it.Since the reasons for its powerfuleffect are obscure, Art Deco always has something of the mysterious about it. Itsuggests that there are geometricand curvilinear forces at work which humans cannot quite understand, but whichsomehow have been captured andfrozen in a particular piece of sculpture, furniture, or architecture. As withgravity or magnetism, the viewer cannotsee the thing itself; he must be content with a glimpse of its “trail” in thematerial world. Hence one’s interest incollecting Art Deco derives at least in part from a desire to assert masteryover the unknown. If it cannot beexplained, then at least it can be controlled or possessed.It is perhaps not surprising that Art Deco came into being during the heyday ofExpressionism, another“mysterious” art form. If the most shocking Expressionist statements came fromWeimar Germany, the differencebetween them and the more subtle impact of Art Deco might be explained by thegreater French and Americancultural influence in the latter. Yet both shared a common theme: the reductionof objects, shapes, and features toan “expression” of their essence - what Plato referred to as a “Form” or “FirstPrinciple”. Expressionist art and ArtDeco are thus æsthetically satisfying because they appear to lay bare thecontrolling forces beneath and behindsuperficial images; they show the thing as it “really is”, not as it appears tobe after being laden with peripheraldecorations.Art, goes the old cliché, is in the eyes of the beholder. One might amend thisto suggest that a work of art has nosignificance in itself; its power lies rather in the emotions, sensations, andrevelations it evokes in the consciousnessof each observer. Thus art is a trigger, a stimulus to the soul. It affirmssomething not about itself or even itsostensible subject, but rather about the psyche of the artist - and theobserver.Hence the Art Deco enthusiast, like the devotee of Expressionism, is by thatinterest making a statement aboutthe nature of his or her soul. He or she is impatient with surface images, boredwith frippery, and drawn by theweird and the outré. Art Deco portrays the human being as one secretly wishes tobe: a kind of Metropolis robot[rix]with a dispassionate, cool, and cruel disposition. Art Deco is never warm, cozy,reassuring; it is glacial andimpersonal. Those fearful of, dissatisfied with, or contemptuous of humanemotions seek in Art Deco a mirror whichwill show them - and reinforce in them - only the non-human aspects of theirsouls.Consider by way of illustration two well-known works of cinema art: EdgarUlmer’s The Black Cat (1934) andRobert Fuest’s two Dr. Phibes films (1971 & 1972).Ulmer, who had won his director’s spurs as an assistant to the greatExpressionist director F.W. Murnau( Nosferatu and Faust), created a story of sexual obsession and Satanism inwhich only the two key antagonists -Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and Vitus Werdegast (Bela Lugosi) - trulycomprehend the nature both of oneanother and of the the conflict between them. The young hero and heroine - aconspicuously naive American couple- are able to sense only that Poelzig is bad news and should be escaped from.Despite Werdegast’s efforts to helpthem, they mistrust him too - since he seems only slightly less menacing thanPoelzig.Of particular interest is the emphatic and overwhelming Art Deco atmosphere ofPoelzig’s home. Built atop theruins of Fortress Marmoros, site of World War I slaughter and “the greatestgraveyard in the world”, it exudes asterile chill of modernity, accented by the Deco’s seeming mockery of the steeland concrete catacombs of theunderlying fortress. Hidden within those ruins are the bodies of many beautifulwomen, suspended in Deco glasscapsules by Poelzig; and deeper still lies his secret Satanic chapel. Thereineventually occurs one of the most graphicBlack Masses ever portrayed on the screen [regrettably edited in most of theversions shown on television]. AgainArt Deco dominates the chamber, with an abstract double-cross surrounded by fourstark, burnished-metal obelisksand an altar-sculpture consisting of a starburst of metal triangles. Upon thechapel’s floor is a giant five-pointedstar, whose shocking contrasts of black and white inspire the same terror in theviewer as do the Expressionist shaftsof light in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari’s famous prison-cell scene.The Art Deco element in The Black Cat, therefore, is a deliberate device togenerate fear - to shatter anyreassurance the audience might derive from familiar surroundings. Unlike thetotally fantastic and distorted sets ofCaligari and Der Golem, the world of The Black Cat lies within the realm of thebelievable because its Decoatmosphere could in fact exist. The film’s artistic strength derivessubstantially from its statement that Art Deco- 364 -inspires and enhances much the same sort of audience disorientation as did theearlier Expressionist sets. Karloffand Lugosi are the icing on a cake that is already very sinister indeed.In The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again Robert Fuest surroundedhis outrageously artisticvillain (Vincent Price) with a phantasmagoria of Art Deco interiors andartifacts, to include a dance-band of full-sizeclockwork robots.* Phibes’ succession of gruesome murders is accompanied byperiod music as well - “Charmaine”,“Darktown Strutters Ball”, “Over the Rainbow” - and the mad doctor makes hisdramatic entrances and exits on anelevating concert organ (with Deco pipes of illuminated crimson glass) to thetune of Mendelssohn’s “War March ofthe Priests”.In the Phibes films, as in The Black Cat, one is stunned by how singularlysupportive the Art Deco is to thedesired climate of horror and the supernatural. Price is inevitably a moretongue-in-cheek rogue than Karloff orLugosi, but the Deco is just as effective in Phibes’ London mansion and Egyptiantomb-lair as it is at Marmoros.Poelzig’s necrophilia is echoed by Phibes, who safeguards the body of his deadwife against a time when she may berevived. Until then Victoria Phibes enjoys a succession of Deco sarcophagi,including a mirrored vault beneath asundial, a neon-lit juke box, and an Art Nouveau canopy of glass shaped like aRolls-Royce radiator and topped withtwo RR flying-lady ornaments.All this is hardly to suggest that Art Deco enthusiasts are frustratedmurderers, sadists, or necrophiliacs. Thestyle has its uplifting aspects as well. But perhaps out brief venture into thedarker side of Deco has provided foodfor thought concerning lesser-known elements of its unique - and elusive -psychology.___________________________________________Part II: Dark Deco II: House on Haunted HillFirst published: Runes #III-6October XX/1985Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close toit when he spoke ofthe nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behindhistory by the loathsomeshapes that seeped down from the dark stars. Instead of describing any definitestructure or building, hedwells only on the broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces -surfaces too great to belong toanything right or proper for this Earth, and impious with horrible images andhieroglyphs ... Twistedmenace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carvenrock where a second glanceshowed concavity after the first showed convexity.- H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuSearchers after Dark Deco need not travel to R’lyeh (actually located on theMicronesian isle of Ponape andreferred to as Nan Madol on conventional maps) to sample the Cyclopeanarchitecture of the Great Old Ones. As youdrive through the fashionable Los Feliz area of Hollywood, a glance up towardsGriffith Park reveals - perchedstarkly on an isolated crag - what appears to be an ancient Mayan temple. Asecond glance belies this; its shape istoo irregular and its atmosphere too sybaritic for any ordinary religiousshrine. Although its dramatic presencedominates the hills and surrounding valley, few of the local residents can - orwill - say much about it. One mustprowl the pleasantly sordid little bookstores along Hollywood Boulevard in orderto locate a faded Necronomiconsetting forth the history of the structure; even then one receives suspiciouslooks from the furtive booksellers, clearlyimplying that no respectable antiquarian would presume to concern himself withsuch outre matters.The edifice at 2655 Glendower Avenue, one learns, was designed by Frank LloydWright in 1924 as a residencefor Mr. & Mrs. Charles Ennis.“Wright had been putting the finishing touches on it,” commented Anton LaVey inX/1975, “when his houseboywent berserk at Taliesen and killed seven people. It was said the house wascursed. He built it for a shoe magnate,and the man lost everything in the Depression. The next owner’s wife jumped offthe parapet.”After 44 years and 6 owners, the house was acquired by a Mr. G. Oliver Brown. In1980 he donated it to theTrust for Preservation of Cultural Heritage, which has undertaken itspreservation and restoration. Since thepublication of “Dark Deco” in its Sophisticate, the Art Deco Society ofCalifornia has been after me for more of thesame. This seemed as good a reason as any for an archaeological expedition toHHH this past September.In 1934 the Ennis House made its film debut in The Black Cat, inspiring thechillingly beautiful residence ofBoris Karloff, the Satanist who preserved his paramours in glass Deco showcases.For years thereafter the house wasrumored to be Karloff’s in actuality, and many a teenaged boy dared a nocturnaltrespass over the wall hoping, nodoubt, for a glimpse of nameless rites & unspeakable orgies within.In 1958, presumably in an effort to improve its image, the House starred againas the House on Haunted Hill,wherein a gloating Vincent Price lures guests into vats of acid and such. In adecadent detour it served as theresidence of art director Claude Estee in the film version of Nathaniel West’sDay of the Locust, and entered sciencefiction in Terminal Man. Most recently it was chosen as the site for HarrisonFord’s residence in Blade Runner -with an amusing twist as noted below. If you have managed to miss all of theabove [shame on you!], you may catchit once more in Howling II, wherein it is overrun with slavering werewolves.- 365 -Frank Lloyd Wright, we are told, did not do Deco - or Mayan - or Moderne - but[ahem!] Frank LloydWright. If the Ennis house looks Mayan/Deco, it is thus purely coincidental. Aswas his practice at the time, Wrightcreated a unique, geometrically-decorated 16” concrete block to be used withinand without the building. Each blockis reinforced by steel rods embedded in the concrete. This sounds like a niceidea, but when it rained the steelbecame wet and expanded, with the result that many of the blocks aredisintegrating [and the roof leaks]. In theinterests of authenticity the Trust has not stooped to the manufacture of newblocks, but when more were neededfor a Blade Runner set, Hollywood cranked out a batch of fakes. Upon completionof filming these were donated tothe Trust, which used them to build a Frank Lloyd Wright dog house for theDobermans who escort trespassersbriskly off the premises.The entrance-hall with its stern stone symmetry, 6’ ceiling, and subduedlighting, does not exactly dispel thenotion that one is entering a pre-Columbian tomb. We were informed by the Trustdocent that Wright intended theceiling to reflect the height of the inhabitants. Since the ceiling jumps to 22’shortly thereafter, one can’t helpwondering at the odd dimensions of said inhabitants. Happily no 22’ denizenappeared, though one of theDobermans [at least I hope it was only a Doberman!] sent a mournful howl echoingthrough the passageways atabout the time we reached the main hall.If you are into geometric concrete blocks, you would be very happy here, as theyare everywhere. In fact thebasic difference between the inside and the outside of the house is that theinside is on the inside and the outside ison the outside. Wright wanted slate floors, but Ennis put his foot down [sorry!]and had white marble installedinstead, which we were told went better with Hollywood bacchanalia of the 1920s.Wright also wanted a dark,rugged wood for the main ceilings; Ennis opted for a beautifully-finished teak.A later owner added a [Mayan/Deco?] swimming pool to the outside patio, from which - if you look out acrossthe Hollywood Hills - you can see alarge white Richard Neutra mansion glaring back at the House on Haunted Hilllike Siegfried confronting Fafnir.Even assuming that the Trust docent didn’t show us the room where Boris K.preserved his ladies, HHH issurprisingly small in terms of living space. Count: living room, dining room,kitchen, two bedrooms w/bath, andden. Wright expected southern California to be warm & sunny all the time, sothere are just two small fireplaceswhich, considering all the concrete and glass around, ain’t ’nuff. One begins tounderstand why the place haschanged owners so frequently: Despite its undeniable beauty and drama, cozy itisn’t. Dazzling guests is all well andgood, but you also want to be able to raid the fridge in the middle of the nightwithout barking your shins on Decoconcrete, donning a coat, or taking a pratfall on the marble.The Ennis house is occasionally confused with another house not too far away -the Ramon Novarro house builtin 1928 by Lloyd Wright, son of Frank L.W., at 5699 Valley Oak Drive.This dramatic mansion of pale concrete and hammered bronze trim was originallydecorated by MGM setdesigner Frank Gibbons entirely in black fur and silver, and Novarro’s dinnerguests were expected to complementsame by wearing only black/white/silver attire. [Novarro later moved to a simpleranch-style house at 3110 LaurelCanyon where, as Kenneth Anger recounts, “his ghastly death by beating in 1968brought to mind the bizarre crimesof Hollywood’s past. Here was a man dying, as he had lived, extravagantly,choked in his own blood - the lead ArtDeco dildo which Valentino had given him 45 years earlier thrust down histhroat.”Tours of the Novarro house are not conducted, as it remains a private residence.Tours of the Ennis house areno longer conducted as of 2009, as the property is presently up for sale:http://www.ennishouse.org/ Be careful notto step in the big vat with the bubbling stuff in it.CommentApril 27, 2006My Dear Michael,Enjoyed your article. However, as amusing as it was to hear you waxing lyricallyat length about the significanceof the decor, all much appreciated I might say, it’s important not to lose sightof the fact that this was a low-budgetproject designed as a vehicle for Vincent Price who, contract-wise, owed AIPthree movies.Bob Fuest (ex Art Director of note) and myself sat down over a few bottles ofwine and tried to write some senseinto what was then an appalling outline. Our motivation? Keep it light andtongue-in-cheek.As a young designer in the industry (this was my third or fourth film), Ihappened to have a passing interest inArt Nouveau/Deco at the time and a reasonable supply of reference materials tohand in my library. It all justhappened, so there.My best wishes to you,Brian EatwellProduction DesignerLos Angeles- 366 -A61: Parastrology- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #III-1 (January 1985) and #III-2 (March 1985)Order of the TrapezoidtAstrology had rather a rough time of it in the Age of Satan.First there was Anton LaVey’s essay “God in Sports Clothes -or- The Stars:Supplement for Weak Egos”. In thisdiatribe (ca. III/1968) Dr. LaVey focused not on the merit of astrology, butrather on its social/psychological impact:If one considers the facts, it is easy to understand why astrology has becomethe popular delusion it has.A wise sorcerer “believes“ in astrology, because he knows that the majority ofthe peoples of the civilizedworld believe in astrology [at least part of the time]; and if enough people aremotivated by a hoax, then thehoax becomes as reality. Therefore, in the manipulation of humans who areaffected by astrology, it isnecessary to know how, where, and when the stars will supposedly guide theirhuman followers so themanipulator will be waiting first in line to deal with his star-led subjects.As all religions are the work of human minds and hands, so astrology must standout as a monumentalbrainstorm on the part of one of the most Satanic enchanters of all time.Astrology always wins, because ofthat most effective sales appeal of all: ego, alias vanity! Everyone who hasever been exposed to astrologybelieves in it - at least for a few minutes - because in those few short momentsof first exposure to astrologythe listener is told about something he cannot ignore: himself - the mostinteresting, scintillating, awe-inspiring, contemplative, and emotionally acceptable subject on this greenEarth!”Warlock II° Michael A. Aquino was not much kinder. In a V/1970 issue of theCloven Hoof I commented:Upon turning his attention to the expanses of space that encompass his planet,man confronts thephysical reality of natural infinity, a concept extremely frustrating to hisdesire to categorize hisenvironment. Consequently the priests of the ancient civilizations groped forexplanations of the firmamentwhich would be sufficiently finite to uphold man’s sense of self-importance.The result was astrology, or star-worship, which has endured in one form oranother since its first majorcodification by the Babylonians in the 10th century BCE. Supposing the externaluniverse to be a sphericalshell circumnavigating the Earth, the astrologer-priests represented the Sun,Moon, and known planets asagents of prophecy and personality determination. Their positions within thestar-beings of the zodiac werethought to exert a direct influence upon the fortunes of Earth and itsinhabitants.The zodiac itself consisted of a band of constellations extending the length ofthe ecliptic andapproximately 9° in each perpendicular direction. Each constellation occupied asupposedly fixed positionalong this band, and the star-beings themselves were located according tocalculations based upon theequinoxes.Unfortunately the Babylonians’ admirable calculations did not allow for thegradual change in the tilt ofEarth’s axis, with the result that the signs of the zodiac eventually ceased tocoincide with their approximateconstellations. Modern astrologers, therefore, proclaim not only the influenceof gigantic masses of flamingrock and gas in human fortunes, but also the influence of random areas of deepspace!... Following which the Church of Satan and Temple of Set paid zero attention toastrology until this past month,when one brave astrologer from New York City, Robert Zoller, was admitted to theTemple under the sponsorship ofStephen Flowers, M.Tr. When the Executive Director showed me Zoller’sapplication, I said, “Astrologer, hmm?Why not send him Watson’s analysis in Supernature and see how he reacts to it?Ask him if he’s run into Playfair &Hill for good measure.”I am ashamed to say my motives were somewhat on the order of Wile E. Coyotesetting a trap for the road-runner. I expected either (a) an angry snarl from a charlatan whose balloon hasbeen pricked, or (b) a sort ofstupefied inability to come to grips with Watson’s criticisms [which are asincisive as, if somewhat more polite thanCarl Sagan’s in Cosmos]. Zoller’s response left me feeling even more like W.E.C.- just after his latest r-r trap hasbackfired on him! Quoth Zoller:I will have to acquire a copy of Playfair & Hill’s Cycles of Heaven before I cancomment on it. RegardingLyall Watson’s bit on astrology which you forwarded, however, I will say that itis overall a very nice piecefor a non-astrologer. The tone is refreshingly balanced, and the author has donehis homework.There are, however, a few criticisms I could make. As an astrologer I see thingswhich the generalreading public might not find noteworthy. If an astrologer had written thearticle, it would have been donedifferently in spots.Page #62: In the calculation it is actually the MC “midheaven sign”(specifically the degree of the sign)which is found first, then the ascendent. Secondly it seems to me that paragraph#2 confuses the signs with- 367 -the constellations - a distinction which Watson attempts to rectify later, butwhich might better have beenhandled first [that is, in the paragraph beginning page #62: “The planets ...”].The problem is that thewobbling of the Earth’s poles causes the phenomenon known as the “precession ofthe equinoxes”. Thisresults in the signs no longer coinciding with the constellations as they did[according at least to someastronomers] ca. 1 CE. This is the first thing on which astronomers fault theWestern astrologer. SoWatson’s statement on page #63 that the scientists cannot take exception [to theinitial logic of astrology] isa bit misleading.The following paragraph introduces the fact that there is in fact a bit ofagreement between astrologyand science. Watson could have gone further had be brought in the research doneat Mount Sinai Hospital[and elsewhere] in NYC on what has been dubbed “chronobiology”. This newscience, begun in Germanyabout 30 years ago, involves a study of the cycles of physiological functions inhuman and animal bodies.The major cycles studied are the circadian or almost-24-hour cycles exhibited bythe the body’s hormonalsecretions. These cycles have been found to greatly affect a patient’s reactionto a given drug at a particulartime. Modern physicians are finding that the same drug administered at differenttimes may have differenteffects. This was known during the middle ages, and medieval physiciansendeavored to intensify the effectof medicines by timing their administration according to astrologicalprinciples.The circadian cycle seems to be due to some kind of light-sensitivity of thepineal gland which secretes agreater or lesser amount of serotonin at different times of the cycle. Besidesthe circadian cycle there are 28-day cycles [in both sexes] and annual cycles. All three cycles are identicalwith [or directly related to] themovements of the Earth on its axis, of the Moon around the Earth, and of theEarth around the Sun.All this is known to, but not discussed by scientists. The problem faced byastrologers is that none ofthese cycles - nor Nelson’s work [pages #63-4], nor Gauquelin’s report of theelectrolyte quality of watervarying with the Lunar phase - shows how an individual’s being born at aparticular time and placedifferentiates him from others born at other times and places. Theabove-mentioned influences apply to allinhabitants of Earth. Still it has led some astrologers to develop ascientifically acceptable ’astrology ofhumanity’, so to speak.Page #64, paragraph #2: Watson appears to confuse sidereal signs with tropicalconstellations. Does hemean Mercury in the sign or the constellation of Virgo?Page #65, paragraph #1: Watson says that “each house occupies 30°”. This is istrue only of the EqualHouse System, which is the oldest system but is now used by few Westernastrologers. Perhaps Watson isconfusing Eastern and Western approaches to astrology, since the EHS is stillused in India. Westernastrologers use a variety of house systems - and argue about “which one isright?”.Page #65, paragraph #2: It is interesting that the Arabs also held - at leastduring the middle ages - thatthe rising planet is the key to one’s profession. My experience seems to confirmthis. Gauquelin’s work isgood, but he often rediscovers concepts “lost” to astrologers unwilling orunable to consult classical sources.Page #67, paragraph #1: Watson states that astrology lacks a clear philosophicbasis. It had such in themiddle ages, and can be said still to have one when we consider that medievalastrology was neverdisproven; rather it fell out of favor as the intelligentsia went over to a newscientific paradigm in the 17thcentury. As modern physics is now supplanting this paradigm with a kind ofneo-Pythagoreanism and awillingness to examine the energy/consciousness equation, it may well be thatmany, if not all of the oldscientific arguments against astrology will become obsolete. The major threat toastrology today is neitherscience nor [as some fear] the religious right; it is the space race. There isnothing like a radical change ofvenue from Earth to Mars to screw up your cycles! The 28-day cycle, which playssuch an important role onEarth, is nowhere to be found on Mars. Should we colonize that planet, we’d needa new astrology for thecolonists.Pages #67-8: The discussion of Clark’s experiments is interesting. The is is thefirst time I’ve heard ofthem, but then I’ve been in the 13th century for years. Most of my work is onmedieval astrology, as will beapparent from Lost Key when you see it.Watch out for Eugen Jonas’ stuff. In Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain[unless I’m mistaken]Jonas was credited with or developed certain birth-control methods. These wereelaborated on in theauthors’ second book. One method dealt with predicting the sex of the child onthe basis of the Moon’sposition in certain “critical degrees” at conception. It doesn’t work. In factit is a “well-known astrologicalmethod” that has been known not to work for some time. Apparently Jonas learneda little astrology from abook and jumped to his conclusion. The authors reported it, people over herebegan to apply it, and it failed.Several years ago I attempted to get a copy of the book. The publisher advisedme that the authors hadwithdrawn it from publication because of the scandal.Addey’s work with harmonics is well regarded in the astrological field - atleast among the astrologers Iknow. The funny thing is that his harmonic system, which he undoubtedlycontributed sincerely, was knownto medieval astrologers. We have evidence of it in Guido Bonatti’s LiberAstronomiæ, ca. 1282.Many years ago Diane LaVey told me the story of the scientists who tested apessimistic child and an optimisticone. The pessimist was placed in a roomful of toys, but he refused to play withthem. “What’s the use?” hecomplained. “They’ll just break sooner or later!” The optimistic child wasplaced in another room which was- 368 -completely filled with horse dung. Undaunted, he seized a shovel and commencedto dig. When asked why by thescientists, he said, “All this dung has got to mean there’s a pony down theresomewhere!”Diane’s reference was to my [and her and Anton’s] dogged faith in the ultimateconsequence and merit of theChurch of Satan despite its many growing pains. Satanism was a concept smotheredin popular misconceptions,absurd myths, and general bad craziness. Somewhere down there was a pony, but tofind it sure required [and stillrequires] a lot of digging.Astrology is a similar pile of dung, equally high and equally smelly. Sittingatop it are hoards of quackastrologers who enjoy the smell and make a living out of selling bags of dung topeople walking by the pile. Nearbystand the Carl Sagans, who try to convince the people not to buy the bags. Most,however, buy at least a small bag.And a few buy great big sacks, which they lug around for the rest of theirlives, huffing and puffing with the strain.Near the base of the pile, comparatively unnoticed, stand Robert Zoller and afew other brave souls, armed withshovels.What are some of the objections the Carl Sagans have to astrology? Well:(1)The constellations are out of synch with the signs (“precession of theequinoxes”). This means thatastrological techniques which appeal to their “ancient origins” for validity areastronomicallyinaccurate.(2) Twins have significantly divergent lives. [Sagan harped on this in theCosmos series & book.](3) A horoscope requires a “beginning” point in time. Why should this be birth?Why not conception?And what is the “moment” of birth, since the average birth takes 1-2 hours? If“radiation from theplanets” is supposed to be the factor, it affects a child in the womb as much asa born child, eitherdirectly or via the foetus’ dependence upon the life-rhythms of the mother.(4) Even assuming that astrology does have an influence over an individual, howstrong or weak is thatinfluence vs. the multitude of social/personal/ etc. influences that will affecthis/her life? Is it so weakas to be of no practical importance?(5) Medieval astrology was based on the presumed influence of light/heat rays.This applies to the Sunand Moon, to be sure, but not to the planets. The sum total of heat and lightreaching us from them isless than that of a single light bulb. [Not until 1954 were the planets (Jupiter& Venus, at least) knownto be emitting EM radiation.](6) Astrologers base their interpretations of planetary influence on themythological characteristics of theplanets’ namesakes, not on the physical characteristics of the planetsthemselves. Same complaintconcerning the zodiac. It is no answer to say that the gods might have beennamed after the planets,since the original Egyptian and Babylonian gods attributed to thoseplanets/decans had significantlydifferent characteristics than those of later astrological tradition.(7) Astrological angles are not precise, since most horoscopes use only 8 out ofthe possible 360°. Andhow does one measure the Sun’s angle vs. the Moon as 90° since at the limits oftheir spheres theymay be separated any~here from 76°30’ to 103°30’?(8) What happens to the influence of planets/stars when said influence must bore8,000 miles throughthe Earth [because the source happens to be on the other side of the planet fromthe birth inquestion]?(9) What about the influence of the bunches and bunches of other stars, systems,comets, nebulæ,quasars, pulsars, galaxies, novæ, supernovæ, etc.? For that matter, what aboutplanets in this systemnot yet discovered when the astrological traditions were being ennobled bycenturies of application [orjust now discovered, like the one beyond Pluto]? What about the Mars/Jupiterasteroid belt? Whatabout the satellites of the planets?(10) Since the entire Solar System is revolving around the center of the MilkyWay Galaxy at 200 km/sec,and since everything in the cosmos changes its position vs. everything elsecontinuously, how canastrology use any “constants” at all?So where’s the pony? Actually there are two of them. The first pony is, as AntonLaVey suggested, astrology’ssuitability as a Lesser Magical device. Under the cover of its colorfulooga-booga language, charts, and books, youcan tell someone anything you want to - and astrology will help get him/her tobelieve it and/or do it. Since it is sodisorganized a discipline, no two astrologers can “disprove” or “expose” oneanother. So commercial astrology is just- 369 -one more trick to part people from their money for nothing and make them go awayhappy, like commercial Tarot-reading, crystal-ball-gazing, tea-leaf-reading, head-bump-feeling, etc.The second pony is, from the Order of the Trapezoid’s perspective, far moreinteresting. Watson touched on it,but the definitive discussion of it to date is in Playfair and Hill’s The Cyclesof Heaven. The second pony is that theSun, Moon, and planets exert far more influence on both the Earth in general andhuman beings in particular thanmost suspect. Only recently has conventional science begun to study this.Astrologers who really want to makesomething of their avocation are in an excellent position to sink their teethinto this area of inquiry, with the goal ofproducing guidelines which people can use for the prediction of moods andbehavior in themselves and others.What kind of forces are actually moving between the Sun and planets of our SolarSystem? Two: gravity andelectromagnetic (EM) radiation. The gravitational force of the other planets hasnear-negligible influence uponEarth; our tidal phenomena are overwhelmingly from the Moon and Sun (which has99% of all mass in its system).But the gravity of the various planets does seem to have an interestinginfluence on the Sun itself.To understand why, consider that the Sun does not “hang motionless” in thecenter of the Solar System. Itchanges its position relative to those of the planets around a common Center ofMass (CCM) which [as in the years1977-1984] may be outside the body of the Sun altogether.U.S. Air Force scientist Paul D. Jose has theorized that the Sun’s motionrelative to the CCM is directly related tothe maximum and minimum periods of Solar flare activity. He has calculated an11.08-year cycle, with most currentmaxima in 1984 & 1995. During a Solar flare there is an increase of X-rays andUV radiation into the so-called Solarwind, a stream of high-energy particles ca. 1 million Kelvin ejected at about 1million mph from the Sun’s corona andtraveling to Earth through the spiral arms of the Sun’s own magnetic field.What happens when such bursts of EM radiation reach Earth? We are shielded fromtheir direct effects by theVan Allen belts, but EM “storms” are produced which do nasty things to Earth’sradio communications systems.More insidiously, the radiation causes an increase in atmospheric ionization.Because the negatively-charged Earthrepels negative ions, we get a heavier than normal dose of positive ions nearthe planet’s surface. Pos-ions, as allSetians should know by now, make you nervous, grouchy, angry, and unhealthy.Neg-ions are good for you andmake you feel great.The Moon’s role in all of this, apart from oceanic and atmospheric tidaleffects, may boil down to its increasedreflection of W/X-ray radiation to Earth during its fuller phases. Full Moon =maximum pos-ions = all the agitationassociated with full Moons, up to & including lycanthropy. This theory wouldrequire the Moon’s reflected radiationto be “added to” the direct radiation produced by the Sun, thus crossing a kindof “human tolerance threshold”.Hence, through this intricate connective chain, the positions of the planets mayvery well affect Earth-dwellers -here and now, and based not upon woolly things like birth dates and Greek-godmyths, but upon demonstrable butnot well-known or finally-proven laws of quantum mechanics.Again as most Setians know [reading list #19J], the human body is a-quiver withits own EM fields and EM-fielddetection systems. The less one is grounded, the more one is sensitive toatmospheric EM disturbances. Most of uslive in a jungle of electrical wires and currents, some (such as AC current) inthe ELF-range. In addition to needingmore precise information about atmospheric EM activity, then, we need similarinformation concerning conditionson this planet that either enhance, retard, or shield that activity.Haunted house Dept.: Researchers of West Germany’s Verein für Geobiologiesearch, among other things, forbuildings with “uncomfortable” mixtures of EM radiation. Lest it be thought thatthis is a German eccentricity, Irecently ran into a San Francisco electronic instrumentation firm handling thesame sorts of problems for bay areacompanies. A vibrating air-conditioner on the roof of a skyscraper can causeinfrasonic resonance throughout theentire structure, making some people ill and setting others at co-workers’throats. But the German VfG carries itsEM detective-work one step further. Its “geobiologists” theorize that thesurface of the Earth is criss-crossed by anetwork of “active strips” about 2m wide. The junctions of such strips arecalled “geopathic” zones, since they cancause mental and/or physical discomfort.Electrical resistance of the Earth can be measured by driving spikes into theground and passing a small currentthrough the ground between them. The geobiologist, H. Petschke, has stated thatwhen this was done within ageopathic zone, a maximum of conductivity was found corresponding exactly to theposition of the “active strips”.Such a difference in conductivity could influence air ionization over the zone,as well as the flow of air and groundcurrents. Perhaps we have here the first real clue to “cursed” spots, such asbuildings in which people feel extremelyuneasy [or become “possessed” ].“I ain’t afraid of no EM!” Dept.: Dr. S.W. Tromp of the BiometeorologicalResearch Centre in Leiden, theNetherlands has found that dowsers (persons so sensitive to EM disturbance thatthey react to the weak currentcreated by the passage of water underground) are able to detect the presence ofIR radiation and electrostatic fieldsfrom another human body - without its having to be present. A measurable“electrostatic aura” generated by one ormore living bodies in a room can remain there for hours or even days after theindividual’s departure - as long as ithas a non-grounded object (such as a bed or chair) to cling to. Grounding theitem in question will cause the “EMshadow” to vanish. Advice to amateur ghostbusters: Take a water-pistol with you.In the case of heavy ghostinfestations, a water-submachine gun modeled after an UZI is available fromEdmund Scientific Corporation.All of which is to say that the Temple of Set is ready for some Parastrologers,and it looks as though the first oneis here, Geiger counter in one hand and UZI in the other.- 370 -Book Review: The Lost Key to Prediction by Robert ZollerNY: Inner Traditions, 1980.- reviewed by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Let’s start with the synopsis from the book jacket:The book is divided into three sections. The first, in order to answer thequestion “What are the parts?”,searches for the primary aim of the astrological art in the greater question“What is man?”. The essence ofwhat is called karma in the East and fate in the West is to be found in theesoteric nature of number and inthe parts, a system of predicating fate. It is from this point that the authorshows how the variousastrological causes arise and how they act on the macrocosm and microcosm.The second section is the author’s translation of an important Latin text on theparts by Guido Bonatti,considered the most influential astrologer of the 13th century. Bonatti explainshow to derive over 100parts, from the mundane to the esoteric, covering all areas of life representedby the 12 houses. In this majorwork Bonatti is seen to take his rightful place as one of the great sages ofWestern astrology, equivalent inrank to Farashara and Varahamihira in Indian astrological history.In the third section the author illustrates the practical use of the partsthrough his own experience andpractice as an astrologer, in natal, horary, and mundane figures. Among otherexamples he uses the parts toreveal startling insights into the Watergate scandal, and to construct anoriginal astrological guide tocommodities speculations. Zoller’s understanding of the parts and their place ina comprehensiveinterpretation of any horoscope is breathtakingly unraveled for the reader, whois able to see step-by-stepthe fascinating revelation of the parts.As a historical text this is a first-rate work. Zoller is obviously not theusual cocktail-party astrologer, but rathersomeone intensely curious about the medieval roots of modern astrologicalprinciples. The notes [especially inSection #1] and bibliography evidence exhaustive research into primary sources.Zoller’s explanations andspeculations are carefully and thoughtfully presented and illustrated.Zoller’s end-run around the scientific fallacies of conventional astrology isingenious. He does not try to justifycosmic bodies’ direct influence on a human being. Rather he contends that thestudy of cosmic bodies should beconsidered a “study of the soul writ large” [in much the same way that Plato’sRepublic was a study of man’s politicalcharacter “writ large”]. Says Zoller:The “stars” and planets” employed in astrology are therefore within - in theheart of the world when weare dealing with mundane astrology, and in the native’s heart in genethlialogy.We deal with the materialglobes in astrology only insofar as they are used to time the movements of theinner “planets” and “stars”that lie hidden at the center of man’s being. Herein lies the true differencebetween the astronomer and theastrologer; and until this is fully apprehended, the more subtle astrologicaldoctrines - such as the parts -will remain unintelligible.This instantly raises the problem as to (a) whether there is in fact a psychic“microcosmos” of planets and starswhirling around in our minds, and (b) if so, whether there is any truecause-and-effect relationship between thatmicrocosmos and the external macrocosmos.Materially and objectively the answer to #a is obviously no. We are not talkingabout a sort of HO-gaugeminiature solar system, however, but rather the ability of the psyche toconceptualize the cosmos as athought. In that sense, Zoller is on solid [and, I think, evolutionary] ground.Materially and objectively the answer to #b is also no. I can create athought-image of Jupiter whenever I wishto, but that image will have only the most superficial factual connections withthe macrocosmic planet [unless Ihappen to be an astronomer who is intimately familiar with the planet’s actualcharacteristics, locus, etc.].Subjectively the answer to #b becomes yes - in a Lesser Magical context. Jupiterhas significance for me to theextent that I feel it does, whether or not the macrocosmic planet gives a damnabout me [which I rather doubt itdoes]. Jupiter’s psychological significance for me may be as a consequence of myown opinions - or as aconsequence of opinions created for me by astrologers. I presumably want toplease myself. Astrologers either wantto please me or control me, either for harmless “entertainment” motives or forexploitive/financial ones.So if Zoller’s premise is correct, he has exploded the balloon of conventionalastrology’s insistence upon thephysical influence of the macrocosmos on humanity. So why does he then, inSection #3 of his book, give us severalchapters of conventional horoscopes? One would prefer to think that this ismerely to illustrate the historicalprinciples identified in Section #2. But the reader’s intelligence is scarcelyflattered by a succession of tabloid-trickssuch as “after the fact” astrological explanations of Watergate and thecommodities market. Perhaps a bit of snake-oil was thought necessary to help sell the book to the tabloid-astrology market.The analytical power that Zoller demonstrates in Section #1 is re-evidenced inthe book’s concluding chapter, inwhich he focuses on the essential issue of his study:- 371 -Yet it was said that to the degree that we expand our observation away fromourselves and out towardthe manifested Creation, to that degree we may see that every aspect of theworld except for Oneparticipates in cyclic mutation. What is this One thing which is immutable, thesame, always present? Whatindeed, other than the Self, the observer of the change, whose uncovering is theaim of spiritual counseling?This alone is the thread which strings together the pearls of experience. Thisis the fountain, the spring fromwhich the Light flows into this world, enlivening the drama ...That which the many take for the self is not the Self but only a graven image,an automaton, thoroughlyand boringly predictable, a red herring to distract our attention from theSource of our Being.The human personality is like a cloudy day. One looks up but cannot see the Sunfor the clouds. Yet ifduring the night the clouds should blow away, one may look up and see theconstellations, the planets, andthe Moon, and know the season and the causes of actions and events here below.Yet, though this knowledgeis useful, it is infinitely inferior to the knowledge of the day, for which theknowledge of night is but aprelude, and which vanishes - as do the stars and darkness at the rising of theSun. And yet until the Sun hasrisen and set repeatedly, and one has frequently watched the orderly movement ofthe stars and planets inthe night sky and witnessed the concomitant mutations among men, he will notrecognize the order of theworld and the One Source from which it all flows. Having recognized the order,he draws nearer the Sourceuntil at last the Sun rises and does not set.This is the aim. The Dawn of the Light of the Sun, of the Self, which may beuncovered through therepeated observation of cyclic phenomena for the purpose of differentiating Sameand Other. All otherefforts are in vain until this occurs. All talk of escaping various aspects ofone’s Fate are ignorant. Allattempts to manipulate destiny according to our whims are madness.This is the first approach to astrology I have ever encountered which strikes meas not only intelligent, butindeed truly brilliant._________________________A Response to Carl Sagan- by Robert Zoller I°It occurs to me that it would be a good idea to address the questions raised onpage #3 of Runes #III-1. I’velocked horns with the “Carl Sagans” of the world on a number of occasions, andthe result is usually an impasse.They cannot accept my position, which is that of a medieval astrologer ratherthan of a 20th century scientificAmerican. I tend to think that the Hermetic doctrine of Mind [expressed in theCorpus Hermeticum] and theoriental concept of Maya ought to be given serious consideration in this regard.This will not happen, of course,because we Westerners are “concrete thinkers”; it seems to be in our geneticmachinery to deny anything we cannothold in our hands.It is beyond me how we can persist in this view in the face of [Greater] magicalexperience. where one can seewalls dissolve into visions of one sort or another, see “hallucinations”involving the transformation of those withwhom we work, and then lastly see our “ridiculous” rituals having the desiredeffect at least some of the time.I suppose it is part of our education. Despite my efforts in astrology, it was 7years before I could fully accept thenotion that it would really work. For awhile I was mildly schizophrenic aboutit, professing one set of values to theoutside world and secretly harboring another set myself. To a point skepticismis healthy. After that it can be a self-imposed “trap” for the educated.Astrological phenomena - the astrologer’s prediction of events and hischaracter-analysis - can be demonstrated.The Carl Sagans deal with this part of the investigation by not doing it. Havingdefined these things as “out of thepicture”, they don’t look at the facts - or they design statistical tests sounrealistic that the results are meaningless.Astrology is not based on a mechanistic, materialistic view of the world inwhich you have neatly divisible andquantifiable things. Astrology “knows” in a moment of time and in a context.There are indeed rules which lead toresults, and astrology leads us to be able to measure the mind - which modernscience can’t measure. But thismeasurement is not easily analyzed with statistics. If psychology and medicinewere subjected to the same statisticalgames, they too would have been “disproven”.(1) Precession: This is a problem to explain because there are 2 systems ofastrology, one using theconstellations and the other the signs. The problem is that they both work, andlogically this seems impossible.Astrology-haters jump on this as an argument against astrology, though actuallyit can be used as such only againstWestern astrology. Indian (Hindu) astrology uses the constellations. It is truethat Western astrology has noastronomical verity, at least as far as the stars of the “signs” are concerned.It is my position that there is no physical causality in astrology.This hardly endears me to other astrologers, most of whom believe thatelectromagnetism will explain it all, norto astronomers [who know nothing besides the “known laws of physics”]. Say Amen!If we presume some form of radiation [and medieval astrologers did ascribe tothat theory, as you pointed out inobjection #5], then we may feel better by condemning Western and acceptingIndian astrology. But this neitherexplains astrology nor explains it away. As you point out, we have not found anyradiation sufficient to explainastrological influence.- 372 -The precession business is best handled, in my opinion, by saying that, whilethere is no “HO-gauge solarsystem” in our heads, there is a microcosm in our unconscious. Call it anarchetype if you will [though I don’t wantto be understood as a Jungian]. This microcosm is not learned; it comes with theterritory. This microcosmcorresponds to a macrocosm which is decidedly not the physical constellations wesee. The men who organized therandom dots of stars in the night sky into constellations had first to discoverwhat Plato called “the bright, clearpattern of the soul” in themselves The really momentous discovery was that thispattern was common to allhumanity, transcending all national and racial boundaries.This universal pattern, epitomized in the glyph of the zodiac, is what isesoterically referred to as the “Word”; itis the pattern according to which all things are ordered. It is possible toelicit far more information from this glyphthrough various numerical “tricks” and an approach in the proper frame of mind.This doesn’t necessarily mean thatall the theorems of physics can be deduced from it. I have found, however, thatso-called “traditional wisdom andmorality” - meaning the way things work in society - are there, as are all ofthe “new age” values which many thinkwill unseat the traditional ones.What is this zodiac? It is clearly what Plato wanted us to look for when, in theRepublic he exhorts us to studythe sky with an eye to the truth rather than to the physical nature of theplanets. It is definitely not an arbitraryphilosophical scam. It is a vision of the harmonia mundi which anyone who wishesto have power must know,regardless of his motivations. The unripe usually cannot see this pattern forwhat it is, hence they respond bydeclaring it obsolete, medieval, etc. It is always operative, and the zodiac -whether Western or Indian - is intendedto be its physical mnemonic referent.Where is this zodiac? It is in the collective unconscious - the anima mundi, theSoul of the World, which is notreally separate from the individual soul (microcosm). Our science has notdiscovered the anima mundi. In fact itsdiscovery was delayed by the General Theory of Relativity. Look for it in thedirection of time/space. It will berecognizable when we understand the relation of energy and consciousness,towards which we are now moving.How dare I assert so outmoded an idea as an anima mundi? Well, everyone knowsit’s there if he has progressed farenough in yoga or magic, or taken sufficient doses of LSD. It is an enigma onlyfor those of us who require thateverything be explained by reference to systems insufficient to do so, such ascontemporary physics.(2) Do twins have divergent lives? Some do and some don’t. I’ve seen reports oftwins’ lives that are sosimilar that it was weird, even though they’d been separated since birth. Butthis is not to say that twins have nodivergencies. Whether or not the birth times are significantly different, thereare ways of explaining horoscopedifferences. For instance, in my experience one twin is solar, the other lunar.Hence one will be extroverted, theother introverted.(3) Beginning of life: Why not conception? In the 1st century CE Ptolemyadvocated using the time ofconception if known. There are numerous points which we can take as thebeginning of life for astrologicalpurposes. Abu Ma’shar, perhaps the greatest astrologer of all time - and totallyunknown to most modernastrologers - invented what he called a “universal question” to determine thenatal horoscope birth time. What heseems to have done [not yet confirmed] was to erect a figure of the sky for thetime, date and place the client asked aquestion of burning importance to him. Ma’shar felt that this figure must relatein a meaningful way to the unknownnatal figure.Today we take the moment of birth as the time of the first breath. Since this isnot recorded, we take the time aswritten down on the birth certificate. For precise work we must rectify thebirth time by analyzing events in the lifeof the client.(4) Strong or weak influence: Strong enough to determine the influences whichyou suggest are causal. Ourunderstanding of life is that one thing causes another. The ancient Germanicconcept of weird held that all thingsare interwoven. The ancient astrologic concepts of heimarmene and harmonia mundihold the same thing.We come into this world at a time congruent with our soul condition. Theoriental philosophies hold that theLaw of Karma determines our lives in accordance with the impressions ( sanskara)of our past thoughts, words, anddeeds - past lives. Whether or not we accept the concept of reincarnation, allnascent magical thought holds that allthings are interwoven such that apparently sequential events are actuallymutually significant. Practical applicationof this kind of thinking led to omenology as well as to astrology and othertypes of “-mancies”.There is much more to this question than I can deal with here. It would requirea course in self-observation andspiritual development. The laws of sanskara are far-reaching and are veryimportant to a proper understanding ofastrology as well of yoga.(5) l discussed this in #(1).(6) Mythology: I agree that astrologers misapply mythology to their subject. Inthe Hellenistic period thenames of the gods were used metaphorically to represent intelligible concepts.We see this in Proclus’ Commentaryon the first Book of Euclid’s Elements where he says: “Philolaus dedicates theangle of the triangle to the godsKronos, Hades, Ares, and Dionysius, since he includes within their province theentire fourfold ordering of thecosmic elements derived from the heavens or from the four segments of the zodiaccircle. Kronos gives being to all- 373 -cold and moist essences. Ares engenders every fiery nature. Hades has control ofall terrestrial life. And Dionysiussupervises moist and warm generation, of which wine, being moist and warm, is asymbol.” He adds that thetriangle contributes to the process of generation and is the chief agent in theproduction of sublunary natures. WhenProclus used mythology, he knew what he was doing. When Jungians and Jungianastrologers do, they don’t.From the above passage it is clear how the signs of the zodiac arose. They arecodes for certain concepts, andbehind these concepts lie number and geometry, as I tried to show in Lost Key.For a personal demonstration ofastrology, try observing the events corresponding to the rising, setting, andculmination of a given planet. With amodicum of sensitivity and simple observation of your inner and outer states,you will have undeniable proof thatthere is something to astrology. Moreover you will have gained it exactly as thefirst astrologers did - empirically.The real question here is why the planets have the names that they do. Theanswer is that the planets were seenempirically to exert certain kinds of influences, whereupon observers rummagedthrough their mythology to findgods or goddesses who seemed to correspond to the observed effect. In Babylon,where astrology grew up, theprocesses of mythologizing and astrologizing went hand in hand.(7) Aspects/Angles: Actually many astrologers use more than the old 8 aspects, 2sextiles, 2 squares, 2 trines,and opposition. I don’t. Geometry is at base here again. You must understandPythagoreanism to understand therole number and geometry have in astrology. The number underlying a thing formsits being.This is no longer “occult”. Our modern physics is now a neo-Pythagorean exercisesince it was recognized thatgeometry is a causal factor in subatomic reality. At the level of hadronbonding, the way subatomic constituentsarrange themselves determines what kind of atom is produced. The geometrydetermines the atom. We find thisprocess of geometrizing continuing up through the mineral (crystalline) kingdominto the biological kingdom. TheOrder of the Trapezoid knows that geometry determines psychology. In many sensesgeometry makes things whatthey are.Some astrologers have tried to explain aspects by reference to wave theory andharmonics [cf. Addey’sHarmonics]. I think it is best approached in practice rather than theory. It isobservable that the Moon’s square isdifferent than her trine, for example. Violent crimes go up at the square. Tomeasure Sun/Moon angles, take theircenters.(8) Planets under the Earth: The influence is still there, though not aspowerful as above, and is determinedtowards the home (4th house ).(9) Nebulae, asteroids, and stars: We have to limit what we use or we’d go nuts.There is only so muchinformation we can process. These things have their influences. and someastrologers use some of them.(10) Movement: Everything in space is moving - at what rate? Is it meaningful toEarthlings? The rate ofprecession is 26,000 years. That’s negligible to us. So is the galactic center.I hope I’ve properly answered the objections - at least as well as can beexpected in a form such as this. Betweenyou and me and the Devil, objections such as these are mere words. They help theintellectual part of us, but wesometimes forget that the “map is not the territory”. If astrology upsets us dueto the cognitive dissonance producedby a violation of our reality system, it is better to put the thing to a testthan to condemn it out of hand.______________________________Twilight Zone: Magic/Science?- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.By way of response to “Parastrology” ( Runes #III-1), Robert Zoller sent a13-page letter, abridged in this issue.While astrology itself is not particularly central to the Order of theTrapezoid, Zoller’s response is germane in asomewhat wider magical context.As readers will note, Zoller’s response evidences his years of investigationinto astrology’s historical roots - aquest which took him through a B.A. degree in Medieval Studies as well asintensive courses in Latin & Hebrew. Onepresumes that his arguments against the “Carl Sagan” objections to astrology,therefore, represent the best casewhich astrology can make.In the 4th issue of the Cloven Hoof I edited (2/1972), I wrote an article onlogic. I did it for the simple reasonthat many people abuse it, either innocently or deliberately. Since the Churchof Satan was in the business of tryingto detect and extract facts from all the woolly thinking, snake oil, andassorted hot air masquerading as facts, itseemed necessary for us to get our heads together on just how to, recognize factwhen/if we saw it.“The logician,” I said. “does not talk in terms of truth. ideals, or morality,but in terms of verification and proof.As an academic discipline logic attempts to distinguish verifiable inferencesfrom inconclusive ones. It isapproached through a comparison of statements, and thus logic is also defined asthat branch of philosophy whichattempts to determine when a given statement or group of statements permit someother statement to be verified.”After discussing deductive and inductive branches of logic, I cited the 11fallacies or “danger signs” for whichSatanists should be alert when assessing an argument. They are:- 374 -(1)Quoting out of context.(2) Sentimental argument: Attempting to prove a statement by citing popular orindividual feelingconcerning the issue.(3) Authoritarian argument: Attempting to prove a statement by citing adistinguished or importantperson or institution who endorses it.(4) Ambiguity: Applies to words, phrases, or statements which were intended tomean one thing but arerepresented as meaning something else.(5) Interdependence: Two unproved statements cannot be used to prove oneanother.(6) Significance: Some statements are accurate only when viewed together withother statementsconcerning the same subject.(7) Argumentum ad Ignorantium: It is illogical to say that a given statement istrue just becausethere is no evidence to disprove it.(8) Composition and Division: What is true of the whole is not necessarily trueof the parts, and vice-versa.(9) Ignoratio Elenchi: When a person proclaims that he is going to provesomething, then actuallyproves something irrelevant to the claim.(10) Non sequitur: Arguments which do not logically substantiate theircontentions.(11) Argumentum ad Hominem: Attempting to disprove something by attacking theauthor orproponent is logically invalid.Now the thrust of “Wanted: Parastrology” was not too far removed from that ofAnton LaVey’s and my earlierarticles on astrology - namely that astrology is not the “God in sports clothes”it professes to be, but that it can beutilized in a Lesser Black Magic (LBM) manner for manipulation of those whobelieve in it. “Parastrology” suggestedthat there is the potential for an even more intricate LBM application ofastrology if that concept is modified to focuson actual non-terrestrial gravitation & radiation influences upon humanorganisms.Subsequently, in my book review of Zoller’s Lost Key, I discussed astrology’spotential use as a GBM technique.As a means by which to organize and categorize the impressions and expressionsof the mind, it is no different thanthe Tarot, the Runes, the I Ching, or even a Ouija board. It can thus serve as akind of “language” or “matrix” toassist the magician in translating sub- or super-rational sensations intorational statements - which can then beanalyzed, assessed, and - most importantly - communicated to other magicians.I thought then, and think now, that Zoller broke important ground here. I wassomewhat less impressed by theconventional horoscopes included in Lost Key, since the premise of such devicesis that the system controls theindividual rather than the other way around. For the magician to state and usethis as propaganda to influence non-magicians is “LBM as usual”. Other magicians. however, are presumably immune tothis as well as to other LBMtrickery - though they can admire the skillful application of any LBM device.Carl Sagan would need no “unrealistic tests” to refute Zoller’s responses, sincehe could do so simply in terms oftheir internal logic per the above checklist of fallacies. In brief:Response #1 - Fallacies #9 & #10. Nor is the existence of a “world soul” eithera deductively established fact oreven an inductively logical probability. If skepticism is to be eschewed infavor of a “benefit of the doubt” approach,it should logically be when the proposition in question is more probable, notmore improbable [as in astrology].Psychology and medicine, of course, have indeed been statistically tested andverified thereby. LSD trip-reports arenot noted for their consistency, reliability or objectivity.Response #2 - A draw. Zoller can say that Sagan’s sample isn’t complete; Sagancan also say the same thingabout Zoller’s sample. Astrology itself is not validated. Fallacy #9.Response #3 - Fallacies #3 (Ma’shar) and #9 [since a method of circumventingrather than solving the problemis proposed].Response #4 - Fallacy #2. Millions of Indians and hippies may believe in karma,but that in itself does notestablish its existence. Nor is Zoller granted the prerogative to identifyand/or ratify “all nascent magical thought”.Yoga exists. but its claims are not all established. Even if they were, this initself would not validate astrology.- 375 -Response #5 - Fallacy #9.Response #6 - Fallacy #5. It is not proven fact that either mythology orastrology is valid, or for that matter thatone conceptually preceded and determined the other.Response #7 - States that greater precision is possible. But this in itself doesnot validate astrology. Fallacy #10.Response #8 - Asserts that the influence is there, but this in itself does notprove its existence. Fallacy #10.Response #9 - Criticism not disputed. To say that the limitation is observedbecause it is easier to observe it isFallacy #9.Response #10 - It is not established that existing universal velocities areirrelevant to humans. For instance, thepath of the Solar System through the Milky Way Galaxy may affect the frequencyand strength of the Sunspot cycle.Fallacy #10.If Zoller hasn’t made a case for astrology’s objective power over humanorganisms, it is certainly not throughneglect of sincere and exhaustive research on his part. But the cruel truth mayjust be that there is no substancethere to be found. Any “predictive” device which is based upon “fate” ratherthan identifiable and measurableelements of probability necessitates a metaphysical “God” which decides andenforces that “fate”. If that were true,the notion of “free will” would be illusory, and we would all be slaves who onlyimagine ourselves to be free.The key premise of the Temple of Set, substantiated by both logical examinationand scientific observation [cf.Black Magic in the Crystal Tablet] is that individual free will does in factexist - in which case there is no such thingas “fate”, and the only outside forces acting upon us are the non-conscious,physical ones of the objective universe,which can influence our minds and wills only indirectly, through pressures onthe physical human body andimpressions on its sensory organs.Elsewhere in the Crystal Tablet the Setian is encouraged to become familiar withstage magic in general andmentalism in particular. Herein are found many tricks by which the future canappear to be predicted - such asafter-the-fact “pre”-dictions, generally applicable characteristics ofrecognizable types of people, use of investigativeinformation which the subject assumes the magician cannot know, slight-of-handreading of “sealed” documents,predictions actually [but not apparently] based upon mathematical formulae, andambiguous statements which maybe “refined” into predictions as the magician engages in seemingly casualconversation with the subject. Sincehoroscopic astrologers hedge their horoscopes with any number of escape clausesin case of an obvious failure, testcases prove only that the stage-magician outwitted one or more subjects - orthat he could not.Horoscopic astrology could be proved only by identification of a “smoking gun”:a detectable, independentlymeasurable force which “makes it work”. Otherwise there is simply no reason togrant it a priori God status over us,any more than we enslave ourselves to the I Ching, the Tarot, YHVH, the Runes,or Ouija boards.Horoscopic astrology retains its value as a LBM device for the Black Magician,so that he can awe and controland profit from the profane and the credulous via its “predictions”.In a GBM context. it can be used as a magical language under the total controland will of the magicianto enable the psyche to understand, organize, and exercise itself. [This is thepoint made in Zoller’s Lost Keyhighlighted in my review in Runes #III-1.The development of a true parastrology, as proposed in the lead article in Runes#III-1, awaits its pioneer(s).- 376 -A62: From Salamander Bones to the Seven Towers of Satan- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #III-3, May 1985Order of the TrapezoidIn our explorations into the phenomena of life and death, we’ve come across agood many interesting facts andtheories, all of which bring us closer to the “smoking gun“ we’re ultimatelyafter: a kind of “unified field theory” thatwould explain things like magic, ESP, PK, consciousness, the psyche. etc.As in any new or unusual field of inquiry. however, there is a higherror-factor. Some of the errors are bothunderstandable and unavoidable: the normal give-and-take of the experimentalprocess.Other errors are more annoying: those which derive from quackery, fraud,ooga-booga mysticism, or just plainstupidity masquerading as true wisdom or authority. It has often seemed in theChurch of Satan, Temple of Set, andOrder of the Trapezoid that we have had to endure three steps back for every onetaken forward, and that whateverknowledge we’ve gained has been at the expense of rather a large number of greyhairs.In this environment it makes our day, as Clint Eastwood would say, to comeacross real “breakthrough”material. Here it comes. in the form of a new book entitled The Body Electric:Electromagnetism and theFoundation of Life by Robert O. Becker, M.D. and Gary Selden (NY: WilliamMorrow, 1985).Becker is an orthopedic surgeon who was not content just to set or wire brokenbones together and let the bodytake it from there. He became interested in the field of bodily regeneration.The first part of his book is an Alice inWonderland tour through hydras, salamanders, and other comparatively simpleforms of animal life that are able toregenerate their bodies in whole or part far beyond the capabilities of morecomplicated life-forms (such ashumans).A hydra cut in half will quickly develop into two hydras, for example, and thesalamander can completelyreplace amputated legs and tail - all at once if necessary - as well as its jawand eye lenses.To make a very long and highly technical story short, Becker gradually uncovereda number of correlationsbetween electromagnetic phenomena and the behavior of living tissue. The first2/3 of his book reads more like amedical research text than a survey written for non-MDs, but it certainlyestablishes the atmosphere of scientificprecision in which Becker operates. When he makes a point about EM fields, it isbecause he has carefully cited theresults of his experiments leading to that particular conclusion.In the last third of the book, Becker takes a close look at a number ofdevelopments in EM research. One ofthese may very well be the “smoking gun” of the Gift of Set itself:Francis Ivanhoe, a pharmacologist and anthropologist at two universities in SanFrancisco, made astatistical survey of the braincase volume of all known Paleolithic humanskulls, and correlated the increasewith the magnetic field strength and major advances in human culture during thesame period.Ivanhoe found bursts of brain-size evolution at about 380-340,000 years ago, andagain at 55-30,000years ago. Both periods correspond to major ice ages, the Mindel and Würm, andthey were also eras whengreat cultural advances were made - the widespread domestication of fire by Homoerectus in the earlyMindel, and the appearance of Homo sapiens sapiens (Cro-Magnon peoples) andgradual decline ofNeanderthals ( Homo sapiens) during the Würm.Two other glaciations in the same time span - the Ganz ca. 1,200-1,050,000 yearsago and the Riss ca.150-100,000 years ago - didn’t call forth such obvious advances in humanevolution. They also differedfrom the other two in that the average geomagnetic field intensity was muchlower.Ivanhoe has proposed a direct link from the magnetic field through thegrowth-hormone regulatorpathways in the brain to account for the sharp evolutionary gains. He suggeststhat part of thehippocampus, a section of the brain’s temporal lobe, acts as a transducer of EMenergy. A part of thehippocampus called Ammon’s horn, an arch with one-way nerve traffic directed bya strong current flow,may read out variations in the field strength, feeding them by a bundle ofwell-documented pathways calledthe fornix to the hypothalamus and thence to the anterior pituitary, wheregrowth hormone is produced. It’sknown that larger amounts of this hormone in pregnancy increase the size of thecerebral cortex and thenumber of its nerve cells in the offspring, as compared with other parts of thebrain.Ivanhoe also notes that the hippocampus and its connections with thehypothalamus are among theparts of the brain that are much larger in humans than in other primates. Theidea gains further supportfrom the fact that neural activity in the hippocampus increases with electricalstimulation and reaches amaximum at 10-15 cps, at or slightly above the dominant micropulsation frequencyof today’s field ...Here, as in experimental science in general, we are dealing with the “how”, notwith the “why”. Nevertheless anunderstanding of the “how” is virtually essential to meaningful conjecturesconcerning the “why”.- 377 -Turning to ESP, Becker suggests that the DC perineural system and its EM fields“provide the only theory ofparapsychology that’s amenable to direct experiment, and yields hypotheses foralmost all phenomena exceptprecognition”.It is possible, he thinks, that higher life-forms’ increasing dependence upondigital impulses for sensory inputmay have suppressed our awareness of the “hum of EM information” from othercreatures, just as the sensoryorgans and brain are known to filter out “noise” of other types so that humanscan concentrate on specificimpressions. If telepathy is linked to ELF (extremely low frequency) radiation,that would account for its notbecoming weaker over great distances.On the less pleasant side of things, Becker came across evidence, both from hisown research and from that ofothers, that certain kinds of EM radiation can either generate or acceleratedamage to living organisms. He cites theinstance of the Russian researcher, Yuri Kholodov, who found areas of cell deathin the brains of rabbits aftersubjecting them to 100-200 gauss magnetic fields. The fields were found to haveactivated stress hormones withinthe rabbits, but in a way that the rabbits could not consciously sense anystress.In 1969 Becker was one of the scientists asked by the U.S. Navy to reviewpossible side-effects from ProjectSanguine, the ELF transmitter the Navy intended to build in Wisconsin tocommunicate with nuclear submarines.He observes:The only thing sanguine we found was the name ... The antenna would produce anEM field 1 milliontimes weaker than that from a 765-kilovolt power line. It was to broadcast at45-70 hz, frequencies closeenough to the Earth’s micropulsations that living things are very sensitive tothem. Similar fields had beenshown to raise human blood triglyceride levels (often a harbinger of stroke,heart attack, or arteriosclerosis),and change blood pressure and brain wave patterns in experimental animals. Thegeneralized stressresponse, desynchronized biocycles, and interference with cellular metabolismand growth processes werealso distinct possibilities.The committee recommended that Project Sanguine be shelved pending further datain these problem areas.The Navy marked the report “For Official Use Only” and eventually moved theproject to Michigan, renaming itProject Seafarer. A new review committee was chosen; Becker was not on it.The ELF project was later redesigned and renamed again, heavily funded by thenew Reagan Administration,and after a lengthy legal battle is now under actual construction.The essence of the danger posed by EMR on living organisms is that ELF radiationof 30-100 hz appears tointerfere with the body’s normal biological cycles. Results may include acontinuous condition of mild stressthroughout the organism, often triggering its various immune anddisease-lighting systems. As the body adapts tothe ongoing presence of these systems, their combative effect on seriousinfections and diseases is lessened.EMR can also cause change in strains of bacteria, enhancing their growth andresistance to antibiotics. This,suggests Becker, may account for the onslaught of “new” diseases since 1950,many of them developing frompathogens previously incapable of inducing disease. Among these: Reye’ssyndrome, Lyme disease, Legionnaire’sdisease, AIDS, and Herpes.Other experiments described at length by Becker, in detail too complex andtechnical to be adequatelysummarized in this article, have yielded implications that:• Microwave exposure can cause decreased energy levels in the brain byinhibiting electron transport chainfunction in brain mitochondria.• Even very weak ELF fields, such as that produced by a TV set 60 feet away, canboth accelerate and decreasehuman reaction time.• A statistical study of suicide events in the vicinity of overhead high-voltagepower lines revealed thatmagnetic fields averaged 22X higher at suicide addresses, and that areas withthe strongest fields contained40X more fatal locations.• Animals exposed to EMR undergo a variety of blood changes, such as decline inred cell count andhemoglobin concentration, hence oxygen capacity.• EMR of the sort received by many people in “home” environments may reduce thestrength of electricalimpulses governing contraction of the heart muscle by as much as 50X.• There is an increasing body of evidence that cell-division-related diseases,such as cancer, are aggravated byEMR.• Improperly or inadequately shielded video terminals may be a factor in theextremely high numbers ofwomen computer operators experiencing miscarriages, stillbirths, and birthdefects.- 378 -Becker devotes considerable space to a discussion of EMR potential asmind-control weaponry, noting that theCIA’s MKULTRA program, in addition to psychedelic drug & hypnosis research, alsoincluded funds for “techniquesof activation of the human organism by remote electronic means”.Readers of my Church of Satan history will be familiar with the Yezidi legend ofthe “seven towers of Satanextending across Asia, atop each of which sits a Priest of Satan, beaming energyto control the forces of the world forevil”. [Cf. William Seabrook, Adventures in Arabia.]Truth is again stranger than fiction: In 1976 a new radio signal began to beheard around the world between3.26 & 17.54 mhz, soon nicknamed the “woodpecker” because of its modulated pulsesignal. It was soon traced to agiant transmitter in the Ukraine. Relates Becker:The signal is so strong it drowns out anything else on its wavelength. When itfirst appeared, the UNInternational Telecommunications Union protested because it interfered withseveral communicationschannels, including the emergency frequencies for aircraft on transoceanicflights. Now the woodpeckerleaves ’holes’; it skips the crucial frequencies as it moves up and down thespectrum. The signal ismaintained at enormous expense from a current total of seven stations, the sevenmost powerful radiotransmitters in the world.Within a year after the woodpecker began tapping, people in various locations inthe U.S. & Canada begancomplaining of pain and pressure in the head, anxiety, insomnia, lack ofcoordination, numbness, & fatigue. Someengineers who studied this phenomenon in Oregon, where the communities of Eugene& Corvallis seemed to beparticularly subject to the symptoms, traced a 4.75 mhz signal to the woodpeckerand suggested that it might in factbe an experimental model of Nikola Tesla’s magnifying transmitter. [Cf. Runes#I-2: “Tesla”.]“The available evidence,” comments Becker, “suggests that the Russian woodpeckeris a multipurpose radiationthat combines a submarine link with an experimental attack on the Americanpeople. It may be intended to increasecancer rates, interfere with decision-making ability, and/or sow confusion andirritation. It may be succeeding.”The Body Electric, then, is a mixed bag of good and bad news. It may open thedoor to the Gift of Set - and itmay just as well confirm the Book of Coming Forth by Night’s warning ofannihilation - not by something asspectacular as bombs or bullets, but, as Dr. Becker puts it:It may be hard to convince ourselves that something we can’t see, hear, touch,taste, or smell can stillhurt us so dreadfully. Yet the fact must be faced, just as we’ve learned ahealthy fear of nuclear radiation.Certain scientists, some perhaps acting in a program of deliberatedisinformation, keep telling the publicthat we still don’t know whether electropollution is a threat to human health.That’s simply not true.______________________Associated Press Update 1990Clam Lake, Wisconsin (AP): A 15-mile antenna strung out like a giant cross inthe Chequamegon NationalForest quietly sends radio messages to missile-equipped submarines patrollingdeep waters around the world.The Navy began using the $400 million ELF system last fall, replacing smallertransmitters that had beensending messages to missile-equipped submarines since the late 1960s.The earlier project went through despite years of protests based on fears thatthe low-frequency radio waveswould fry fish in nearby streams and produce two-headed squirrels.“In the last two years we have had only two protests of any significance. Thosefolks were strictly anti-military,”said Lt. John Smythe, project commander. “I think the biological, ecological andsafety issues have all beenaddressed.”At one point, demonstrations occurred almost weekly at the fenced-in transmittersite in northwesternWisconsin. Nuclear-weapons opponents argued the system would make the forest atarget for Soviet missiles, andenvironmentalists called for more studies.ELF, or extremely low frequency, is the only system of its kind that sends radiowaves that penetrate water Thesystem permits submarines to prowl undetected by radar while receiving messagesseveral hundred feet underwater.The antenna - two strands of cable strung on wooden poles - and a transmitterare tucked into the forest atop20,000 feet of buried rock near Clam Lake, a quiet tourist wayside. Bearsfrequently climb on the poles, andsnowmobiles glide through a corridor carved in the trees.Jerry Holter and his wife Tish, both 60, live about a mile from the antenna andhave watched the project unfoldsince 1969. “They brought in peace activists by the busloads,” Holter recalled.“You won’t find anybody in the areathat ever thought the project would do all the things opponents claimed,including make you sterile if you walkedunder the lines.”Mrs. Holter served as a “human guinea pig” for researchers monitoring themedical effects of the system onnearby residents. “We are both so darn healthy, it’s funny,” she said.- 379 -But Mark Peterson, executive director of the Sigurd Olson EnvironmentalInstitute of Northland College inAshland, said the project still has its skeptics. They point to studies thatindicate milk production of cows that grazenear high voltage electrical lines drops off, he said.The system, and a companion one near K.l. Sawyer Air Force Base south ofMarquette, Michigan - use a total of$60,000 worth of electricity each month and employ about 75 people, mostlycivilians, Smythe said.ELF is scaled down considerably from the original plan, which included a grid of6,200 miles of buried cableand 100 transmitters built to survive a nuclear war.- 380 -A63: Proxemic Magic- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #III-4, July 1985Order of the Trapezoid“Magick,” Aleister Crowley once wrote, “may be defined as the name given toscience by the vulgar.” By this hemeant that the knowledge and application of obscure scientific principles mayvery well seem “magical” to anignorant observer, whether the practitioner be a stage magician or a NASAastrophysicist.A corollary to this observation is that so-called “magic” [or “Magick”] basedupon nothing more than meresuperstition or ooga-booga mysticism is objectively useless, meaning that itwon’t accomplish a damned thing if theperson or persons in question are unaware of it. The ooga-booga stuff will workonly if the person at whom it isdirected (a) knows about the Working and (b) is superstitious enough to believein it. [Note: The magician shouldnever make the mistake of assuming that another person is not sufficientlysuperstitious just because that individualprotests to that effect. The less people know about the Black Arts, the morethey are vulnerable to superstitiousreactions to them.]I cannot overemphasize how important it is that the Black Magician not foolhimself or herself in this regard.You are differentiated from White Magicians, among other things, preciselybecause you aren’t scared silly by yourown tools, and because you don’t deceive yourself as much as - or worse than -the other person. The BlackMagician must always know what is happening and be in control of it. If hedoesn’t know quite what is happeningwhen a given technique is being used, then he approaches that Working in muchthe same manner as a scientistmaking a laboratory experiment: He constructs and tests various theories andtakes note of such results as maymanifest themselves.To me the foregoing has never seemed like a very difficult principle to grasp.Yet for the better part of twentyyears I have been amazed by the number of people - Magicians, and would-be BlackMagicians - who have scaredthemselves [and made themselves look ridiculous in the bargain] by taking somerag-tag superstition from some oldgrimoire and turning it into a personal idol before which to abase oneself. Ilike to think that one of the key virtuesof the Temple of Set - and the saving grace of the old Church of Satan before it- has been the rejection of self-deceit,which Anton LaVey so accurately labeled “the greatest of all ‘sins’”.The focus of this article, like so many Runes articles before it, is uponanother aspect of science which issufficiently obscure to warrant its being venerated as “magic” by the vulgar.Hence it is suitable for practical use bythe Black Magician. Because it is based upon objective principles, rather thanooga-booga tosh, moreover, it can beapplied successfully whether or not the object of the Working knows about it orbelieves in it.In 1966 an anthropologist by the name of Edward T. Hall wrote a very interestingbook entitled The HiddenDimension (Garden City: Doubleday & Co.), whose central theme, he said, was“social and personal space and man’sperception of it. ‘Proxemics’ is the term I have coined for the interrelatedobservations and theories of man’s use ofspace as a specialized elaboration of culture.” Hall elaborates on his thesisthus:It has long been believed that experience is what all men share, that it isalways possible somehow to bypasslanguage and culture and refer back to experience in order to reach anotherhuman being. This implicit - and oftenexplicit - belief concerning man’s relation to experience was based on theassumptions that, when two human beingsare subject to the same ‘experience’, virtually the same data are being fed tothe two central nervous systems andthat the two brains record similarly.Proxemic research casts serious doubt on the validity of this assumption,particularly when the cultures aredifferent. People from different cultures not only speak different languagesbut, what is possibly more important,inhabit different sensory worlds. Selective screening of sensory data admitssome things while filtering out others,so that experience as it is perceived through one set of culturally patternedsensory screens is quite different fromexperience perceived through another. The architectural and urban environmentsthat people create are expressionsof this filtering-screening process. In fact, from these man-alteredenvironments, it is possible to learn how differentpeople use their senses. Experience cannot therefore be counted on as a stablepoint of reference, because it occursin a setting that has been molded by man.Hall begins his study with a discussion of the mechanics of distance regulation,first between animals, thenbetween humans. “Flight distance” (FD) is the point at which an animal will fleewhen approached by a potentialenemy: for example 500 yards for an antelope and 6 feet for a lizard. If youmanage to approach too closely withinFD, you will encounter “critical distance” (CD), wherein the animal feels sothreatened that it will begin to stalk orfight. The famous Swiss animal psychologist H. Hediger offers one illustration:A lion in a zoo will flee from an approaching man until it meets aninsurmountable barrier. If the mancontinues the approach, he soon penetrates the lion’s CD, at which point thecornered lion reversesdirection and begins to stalk the man. In the classical animal act in thecircus, the lion’s stalking is sodeliberate that he will surmount an intervening obstacle such as a stool inorder to get at the man. To get thelion to remain on the stool, the lion-tamer quickly steps beyond the CD. At thispoint the lion stops- 381 -pursuing. The trainer’s elaborate “protective” devices - the chair, the whip, orthe gun - are so muchwindow-dressing.Human beings are also subject to FD/CD stimuli, as well as to an intermediatecondition which Hediger terms“personal and social distance” (PSD). We have a variety of physical sensors bywhich we make such subconsciousdecisions: sight, hearing, and smell at a distance; and touch up close. In somecultures, people are accustomed tobeing within the smell-radius of others, for example - and in fact judge moods,class, and relationships in part onolfactory impressions. In other cultures, such as that of the U.S., we arerepelled by the scent of anyone except thosewith whom we are personally intimate. This simple fact may identify an invisibleyet powerful barrier againstAmerican rapport with various mid-eastern cultures.Japanese culture emphasizes the “stretching of visual space”, as in gardens(wherein steps along paths orstepping-stones must be individually picked with care) or in rooms (wherefurniture tends to be arranged in themiddle rather than near or against the walls). To the Westerner, a Japaneseenvironment often appears “open” and“spacious” even if the physical dimensions involved are no greater than those ina Western home or office.In public spaces and conveyances, on the other hand, orientals and Arabs have amuch higher tolerance forcrowding than do Westerners. Observe the behavior of mixed ethnic groups on acrowded subway or bus and see foryourself. [Hall theorizes that the increased attention to personal living-areaspaciousness by the Japanese may be inthe nature of a partial compensation for this.]The human skin’s ability both to transmit and to sense emotional states isgreater than most people know.Anger or embarrassment triggers blushing, for example, but it also increases theblood supply to various parts of thebody, causing [among other things] a subtle swelling of the forehead andtemples, and a resultant rise in skintemperature in those areas. Observers can detect such changes by skin-basedthermal detectors, by more intenseolfactory sensation (smell), and by visual impact. Some women interviewed byHall commented that changes in thebodily temperature and odor of dancing partners, for example, were reliableadvance-signs of lust, anger, etc. - longbefore the male in question would speak or act accordingly. Crowley, in additionto his skill in recognition of visualsignals [“Give me the sign of the Open Eye”], was similarly a student of space-and smell-based behavior. His subtleuse of these techniques astonished many an onlooker, who might well credit theresults to the supernatural. [Cf.William Seabrook’s account of Crowley’s “magical” trip-up of a pedestrian. TheBeast merely intruded on hisvictim’s auditory space.]Heat and space-perception are related. People in a cool, crowded room will notfeel as cramped as the samenumber of people in a similar-sized room which happens to be hot. Whether or notyou see or hear other persons,your heat-sensors will react to them if you are close enough. [To sample yourown heat-radiation sensitivity, placethe back of your hand close to your lips. Both generate a high level of heat.Then move your hand up and down infront of your face. Also try near-skin experiments with another person,particularly “out of eyesight”. You may besurprised at the results.]Photographs and paintings of individuals create an immediate attitude-impressionin a viewer depending uponwhether they place him or her in FC/FD of the subject. [Try looking at people in“close” or “distant” pictures and seehow you react. Also try viewing both types of pictures from near and distantpositions.] Maurice Grosser, in ThePainter’s Eye (NY: Rinehart & Co.) states:Four to eight feet is the portrait distance: Here the painter is near enough sothat his eyes have notrouble in understanding the sitter’s solid forms, yet he is far enough away sothat the foreshortening of theforms presents him no real problems. Here, at the normal distance of socialintimacy and easy conversation,the soul of the sitter begins to appear. Nearer than three feet, within touchingdistance, the soul is far toomuch in evidence for any sort of disinterested observation. Three feet is thesculptor’s working distance, notthe painter’s. The sculptor must stand near enough to his model to be able tojudge forms by sense of touch.The next time you visit a museum which contains statuary from several historicalcultures, try to sense (a) fromwhat distance the sculptor wrought a particular statue, and (b) from whatdistance he intended that it be viewed -and why. Note that Egyptian statuary tends to focus on the ka or psyche, Greekstatuary on the physical ideal ofbeauty, and Roman on the physical reality of individuals. Once you perceivethese interrelated “filters”, you willbegin to understand why these images affect you in the way they do - and whichyou couldn’t previously explain on aconscious level.Perspective in painting was re-discovered at the time of the Renaissance,enabling the viewer to focus on variousparts of a painting and see them proportionately represented. A peculiarity ofRembrandt’s style is that he painted“stationary visual fields”, such that by focusing on a portrait’s centralfeature you will see the entire portrait in thesame clarity/lack of clarity as you would standing before the individual inquestion and observing him/her with yourfoveal, macular, and peripheral vision.The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that the “boundary” of each humanbeing does not end with the skin.Each individual possesses an unseen “personal field” - or rather variety ofsituational fields - which constitutes his orher true “boundary”. The magician who succeeds in controlling or alteringanother individual’s“personal field” thus controls or alters that person just as assuredly as thoughhe were able tocontrol his conscious personality.- 382 -As Dr. Becker’s bete noir was the high level of electro-magnetic activity incontemporary Western civilization[see my “From Salamander Bones to the Seven Towers of Satan”, Runes 5/85],Hall’s is the contemporary city,which he views as an absolute disaster for human spatial psychology. The moreyou jam people together, the morepsychotic and antagonistic their behavior will become, due to intrusions withinand disruptions of their personalfields. When high-density is disguised by sensory screens and barriers (such asapartment living), people becomelethargic and stupid. The civilization of man has significantly muffled his FDreaction, enabling him to tolerateothers within his FD radius. But if he is made fearful of others, the FDinstinct can suddenly reassert itself withexplosive force, resulting in the sheer savagery of inner-city crime and riotingunknown in more open environments.Hall concludes:Man and his extensions constitute one interrelated system. It is a mistake ofthe greatest magnitude toact as though man were one thing and his house or his cities, his technology orhis language were somethingelse. Because of the interrelationship between man and his extensions, itbehooves us to pay much moreattention to what kinds of extensions we create, not only for ourselves but forothers for whom they may beill-suited. The relationship of man to his extensions is simply a continuationand a specialized form of therelationship of organisms in general to their environment. However, when anorgan or process becomesextended, evolution speeds up at such a rate that it is possible for theextension to take over. This is what wesee in our cities and in automation. This is what Norbert Wiener was talkingabout when he foresaw dangersin the computer, a specialized extension of man’s brain. 138 Because extensionsare numb - and often dumbas well - it is necessary to build feedback/research into them so that we canknow what is happening,particularly in regard to extensions that mold or substitute for the naturalenvironment.138 [M.A.A. comments:] God & Golem, Inc.: A Comment on Certain Points whereCybernetics Impinges on Religion by NorbertWiener.

Pagels (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1985)- reviewed by Michael A. AquinoRunes #III-5, September 1985Order of the TrapezoidI suppose this could be considered one of those “Oh, geez, he’s on another ofthose cosmic/theoretical trips”book reviews, but honestly it didn’t start out that way. Having for some yearsbeen annoyed with what I can onlyterm the idiotic insolence of the “big bang” theory [such insolence consistingof (a) the assumption that a primalylem/firecracker “just happened to exist” and (b) the assumption that a cosmicmatch “just happened to be aroundto light its fuse”], I searched and searched for a cosmology which wouldn’tinsult my intelligence and finally [in1973] found it in Dr. Oskar Klein’s infinite-time/cyclical theory of Universaloscillation. I discussed this theory in“Genesis II” ( Cloven Hoof #IV-7 & Appendix #57 of The Church of Satan) and wenton to other matters. [Klein’stheory is expounded in its elegance and simplicity in Worlds-Antiworlds:Antimatter in Cosmology by HannesAlfven. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman & Co., 1966.]Every theory has to have a hat-rack on which to hang its hat. Einstein assumedthe velocity of light to be anabsolute constant, and upon this hat-rack he proceeded to hang the rest of hisrelativity ideas. If you accept that hat-rack as a “given”, then Einstein’s conclusions drawn therefrom interrelate verynicely.Similarly, if you accept the literal truth of the Judaic/Christian Bible as yourhat-rack, then it is possible toderive a large body of sub-conclusions from it which all interrelate verynicely.Similarly, if you accept an ylem/firecracker & cosmic match as your hat-rack,then the “big bang” theory trotsalong after it like a good doggie.In short, if you can get someone to buy your axiom, then you’re home free,’cause then it’s just a question offilling in the nooks & crannies. Einstein was well aware of this from thesuccess of his relativity road-show, sodecided to go for the sweepstakes: the Grand Axiom which, if he could sell,would enable him to preside over thephysical re-definition of the universe. This was his celebrated “unified-fieldtheory”. When he ran this baby up theflagpole in 1953, however, it wasn’t saluted. To this day the UFT floats insuspended animation, like HowardHughes’ “Spruce Goose”, while onlookers try to decide whether to (a) acclaim it,(b) decry it, or (c) just ignore it.In the case of Klein’s theory, the hat-rack was the principle (or neter) ofsymmetry. In its simplest sense thisprinciple implies that nothing in the natural universe exists without a “mirrorimage” co-existing. Statement of thisprinciple was not original to Klein; it was crucial to Egyptian cosmology, was[re]discovered with toots & whistles byNewton, and even acquired occult credentials as Aleister Crowley’s “0=2”equation.The tricky thing about symmetry is that the “positive” and “negative” sides of agiven substance will notnecessarily appear the same. If you saw “0” suddenly “split” into a “+6” and a“-6”, it would be pretty easy to put the“+6” and the “-6” on opposite sides of a symmetrical relationship. But supposeyou walked into a universe consistingof 3,1,1,4,2. You’d have to mess around awhile before coming up with 3x2=4+1+1... or 6=6. Anyone who’s survivedhigh school chemistry remembers the sheer terror of being presented with oneside of a chemical equation, and onechanged part of the other side, and being required to figure out the rest inconfigurations that were not molecularinsanity.If you expand your universe beyond matter and energy - for example into time andmind - symmetry becomesalmost impossible to trace. Where is the “negative Michael Aquino”? Is it someweird Doppelgänger, with whom Imay someday accidentally collide and mutually implode? Far more probably my“opposite half” is a mixture of time,mind, matter, and energy which may be scattered among galaxies and diffused overæons of time. So symmetry isone of those neteru/Platonic Forms which is visible and even demonstrable as asimple concept, but which quicklybecomes elusive as it is carried to its ultimate implications.An eternally oscillating objective universe is symmetrical. A “big bang”universe is not symmetrical, as itpresupposes the spontaneous appearance of only one side of the equation - a sortof cosmic “horn of plenty” inwhich a whole lot of goodies continue to tumble out of the open end of a conicalbasket whose other end shrinks intoa point. To my simple brain this is just so much cat shit.So by now you’ve probably deduced why I began to wiggle my nose and wag my tailwhen I saw a book titledPerfect Symmetry on the shelf. Here, it seemed, might be the Cosmic Graal I wasquesting for. Is it?No and yes. The first 3/4 of the book consists of ho-hum chapters in Physics#1A, Astronomy #1A, and Rah RahEinstein, and I began to think I had wasted another $18.95. But then Pagels(Executive Director of the New YorkAcademy of Sciences) took his necktie off and got into a discussion of GUTs(Grand Unified Theories) and theirimplications, which is what universal symmetry is all about. There are still bigholes in GUTs, the most notorious ofwhich is gravity (which to date hasn’t been explained, much less shown asconvertible into anything else). And untilyour GUT is complete, you can’t use it as a hat-rack.- 384 -Perhaps most infuriating to physicists [but not to Setians, who have anappropriate ace up their sleeves] is the“Catch-22” of GUTs: that human intelligence, being a component of the MasterLaw, would by definition beinadequate to apprehend it. In this sense, conventional physics ultimately comesaround to the same hat-rack asreligion: that the nature of “God” cannot be apprehended by human minds, hencemust be acknowledged andobeyed as an act of faith.Pagels is not deterred by such petty potholes. For example:In 1968, even before GUTs were invented, Andrei Sakharov, a Soviet scientist,realized that if baryonnumber is not conserved, it would explain in part how the matter-antimatterasymmetry we see today couldhave arisen from a state of perfect symmetry. Sakharov also realized thatbaryonic-number non-conservation, while a necessary condition for the creation of matter, was notsufficient. Other conditionshad to be met.The first of these conditions is that the universe has to make more matter thanantimatter. In order forit to do this, matter and antimatter, which are through-the-looking-glassversions of each other, have to bedistinguished by some interaction that tells us on which side of thelooking-glass the present universe is.Experimentalists have actually detected such interactions (they are called timereversal-violatinginteractions), so this condition is met.Another condition is that the universe must, during a very early stage of itsdevelopment when thebaryon-number-violating processes are most effective, be in a state ofnon-equilibrium. This means that atsome time in its early history, the universe must undergo a “phase transition”,a change of its basic statewhich happens so rapidly that the rate of collisions between the quantumparticles in the primordial gascannot keep up with it. If such a phase transition occurs, any matter-antimatterasymmetry that getsgenerated during the transition also gets to stay, because once the transitionis over, the baryon-number-violating processes become less effective and baryon- number conservation iseffectively restored. The“extra” protons and neutrons, generated out of nothing, are now locked into theuniverse.In summary, a matter-antimatter symmetry could be generated starting from asymmetric stateprovided that (1) baryon number was not conserved, (2) time-reversal-violatinginteractions exist, (3) theuniverse was once in a non-equilibrium state of extreme expansion. In thestandard model neither condition#1 nor #3 is met, and hence the origin of visible matter remains a puzzle inthis model. However GUTs,which go beyond the standard model, can violate baryon-number conservation. Thisled to a revival ofinterest in explaining the observed matter-antimatter symmetry. By 1978 manytheoretical physicists,realizing that this old puzzle could now be explained in the context of GUTs,were hard at work calculatingthe symmetry to see if it would agree with observation.A few years ago a T-shirt with the slogan “COSMOLOGY TAKES GUTs” enjoyed modestpopularityamong cosmologists. The slogan meant that GUTs could solve the problem of theorigin of the matter-antimatter symmetry and thus explain the genesis of the visible universe. Yetanother meaning of the sloganis that many GUTs imply that the neutrinos are not strictly massless and hencecould make up the darkmatter of the cosmos. GUTs might provide the answer to the origin not only ofvisible matter, but of theinvisible matter as well.This is a good first shot; it is as though a person trying to navigate a roomwhile blindfolded and hopping on onefoot has decided to stand on both feet. Until he takes off the blindfold [ofEinsteinian relativity], however, he’s got afew more walls to crash into.In subsequent chapters, Pagels goes into what are charmingly called “SUSY GUTs”,or super-symmetry GUTs.These are highly theoretical GUTs including complex assumptions concerninggravity, and a quote from this part ofthe book would probably leave you more dazed than the above one, unless you hadfirst warmed up to it by theextended discussion in the text:Kaluza demonstrated the unification of gravity and electromagnetism by means ofhis compact 5thdimension only by making several restrictive assumptions in solving Einstein’sequations. In 1926 OskarKlein significantly advanced this theory by showing that these restrictiveassumptions were completelyunnecessary. Furthermore Klein calculated the radius of the little circle in the5th dimension in terms of theknown quantities, the Planck distance scale, and the electronic charge, andfound this radius to be about10-30 cm - an extremely small radius ensuring that the 5th dimension is safelyout of sight. But in spite ofits small size, the freedom that fields have in moving around that tiny circleis always present at every pointin ordinary space, and that freedom is all that is needed to guarantee theexistence of the electromagneticfield.After the 1930s the Kaluza-Klein idea fell out of favor, and for manyyears it lay dormant. But recently,as physicists searched out every possible avenue for the unification of gravitywith other forces, it has againsprung to prominence. Today, in contrast to the 1920s, physicists are challengedto do more than unifygravity with just electromagnetism - they want to unify gravity with the weakand strong interactions aswell. This requires even more dimensions, beyond the 5th.- 385 -Theoretical physicists have generalized the original 5-dimensional theory intoan arbitrary number ofhigher dimensions. All the higher dimensions are compact; they are curled upinto a tiny multi-dimensionalspace that exists at each point of ordinary space and hence is unobservable. Butthe freedom of movingaround these compact, tiny spaces with symmetries more general than the simplesymmetry of a circlecorresponds exactly to the freedom of performing Yang-Mills gaugetransformations. Remarkably the localgauge symmetries are precisely the symmetries of the compact higher-dimensionalspace. Because of thismathematical fact, all the gauge theories of Yang-Mills fields can beinterpreted purely geometrically interms of such higher-dimensional spaces.Sadly, this exciting discussion is followed by a rather violent crash into thewall as our noble author endeavorsto jam the stepsister-foot of the “big bang” into the glass slipper of symmetrytheory. Actually he does this in arather cute way. To simplify: If you can say that time “goes to zero” at themoment before the “big bang”, then you’vegot an infinitely-contracting variable on that side of the symmetry equation, soyou can shrink the other side downto an infinite contraction as well. This is kind of shaggy-dog physics, andPagels - to his credit - concedes as much.But on the whole I would say he deserves a round of applause for what isultimately a courageous charge intofrontiers that conventional minds fear to approach.- 386 -A65: Nautical Twilight Zone- by Michael A. Aquino VI°, GM.Tr.Runes #IV-2, March 1986Order of the TrapezoidIn mid-1984 moviegoers were treated to an unusual science-fiction film entitledThe Philadelphia Experiment.In that film the destroyer-escort U.S.S. Eldridge vanished from sight at thePhiladelphia Navy Yard in October of1943 into a sort of time/space-warp - the result of an experiment inelectromagnetic-field-generated radar-invisibility which accidentally activated dimensional forces beyond thoseanticipated. Two sailors who jumpedoverboard wound up not in the water, but in 1984! The rest of the storyrecounted the Navy’s efforts to locate them,and to send one of them back through the time/space-warp to shut down themachinery aboard the Eldridge andreturn her to 1943 - albeit with hideous after-effects on the crew, some ofwhose molecular displacements hadbecome entangled with that of the destroyer.What most of those who saw the movie do not know is that the story of the“Philadelphia Experiment” is notnecessarily fictional. For some years it has been a staple side-show in thatamusing but rickety collection ofcuriosities, enigmas, and tall-tales that are periodically re-floated in vanDäniken-style paperbacks. After you'veread the first dozen such books, the goggle-eyed astonishment tends to wear thin- and after the second dozen [ifyou're really bored with what else is available on the rack] you can scanaccounts of Earthwoman rape by UFOpilots, BHM (big hairy monster) sightings in the Himalayas, and/or ASS(abominable swamp slob) chases in theEverglades without getting the least bit unnerved.In a way this is too bad, because mixed in with all the BHM/ASS accounts aresome incidents, discoveries, andphenomena that are indeed rather at odds with the known objective universe. [Howmany of you know, for example,that H.P. Lovecraft’s fabled Irem (the ancient “city of the pillars” of theGreat Old Ones in Arabia) has a basis inArabian legend as an actual ruin ( El Yafri) in the so-called “Empty Quarter”(the Rub el Khali) of the ArabianDesert? [Comment 1992: Since this article was originally written, that city hasbeen discovered by archaeologists.]The Philadelphia Experiment is one of those incidents that started assemi-authenticated fact, was then exposedas an apparent hoax, was thus relegated to the loony-bin for many years, and nowis beginning to gain a bit ofreexamination as something that may be at least partially true after all.What is publicly known about the PE today is due primarily to the efforts of aMinnesota school teacher by thename of William L. Moore, who became obsessed with the PE mystery and spentyears following up every possiblelead concerning it. The result was a book, The Philadelphia Experiment (NY:Fawcett Crest, 1980, reissued byBallantine, 1984). Herein Moore sums up his rather impressive findings.The story of the PE began with a series of letters from a “Carlos Allende/CarlAllen” sent in 1955 to scientistMorris Jessup, whose reputation as an up-and-coming astrophysicist had themisfortune to be tainted by hisinterest in the subject of UFOs. Such individuals, particularly if they publishanything on the subject [as Jessup did],are magnets for all sorts of nut mail, and at first glance the Allende lettersseemed to fall squarely into that category.They came from spurious addresses, were written in various colors of ink, withinconsistent punctuation/capitalization, and were anything but logical in organization. For example:The “result” was complete invisibility of a ship, Destroyer type, and all of itscrew, While at Sea (Oct.1943) The Field Was effective in an oblate spheroidal shape, extending onehundred yards (More or Less,due to Lunar position & Latitude) out from each beam of the ship. Any PersonWithin that sphere becamevague in form BUT He too observed those Persons aboard that ship as though theytoo were of the samestate, yet were walking upon nothing. Any person without that sphere could seeNothing save the clearlyDefined shape of the Ships Hull in the Water, PROVIDING of course, that theperson was just close enoughto see yet, just barely outside of that field. Why tell you Now? Very simple; IfYou choose to go Mad, thenyou would reveal this information. Half of the officers & the crew of that Shipare at Present, Mad asHatters. A few, are even Yet confined to certain areas where they May receivedtrained Scientific aid whenthey, either, “Go Blank” or “Go Blank & Get Stuck.” Going-Blank IS Not at all anunpleasant expierence toHealthily Curious Sailors. However it is when also, they “Get Stuck” that theycall it “HELL”INCORPORATED” The Man thusly stricken can Not Move of his own volition unlesstwo or More of thosewho are within the field go & touch him, quickly, else he “Freezes” ...There are only a very few of the original Expierimental D-E’s Crew Left by NowSir. Most went insane,one just walked “throo” His quarters Wall in sight of His Wife & Child & 2 othercrew Members (WASNEVER SEEN AGAIN), two “Went into “The Flame,” I.E. They “Froze” & caught fire,while carryingcommon Small-Boat Compasses, one Man carried the compass & Caught fire, theother came for the“Laying on of Hands” as he was the nearest but he too, took fire. THEY BURNEDFOR 18 DAYS. The faith in“Hand Laying” Died When this Happened & Mens Minds Went by the scores. Theexpieriment Was aComplete Success. The Men were Complete Failures ...- 387 -Jessup died in 1959, an apparent suicide, without making any particular effortto follow up on the Allendeletters. Intriguingly enough, the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research (ONR)did. A copy of Jessup’s UFO bookannotated by Allende was reproduced and circulated within ONR, and unsuccessfulefforts were made to locateAllende himself. From the 7/23/76 form letter which the Navy routinely sends toPE inquirers:The book came to the attention of two officers then assigned to ONR who happenedto have a personalinterest in the subject. It was they who contacted Dr. Jessup and asked him totake a look at his book. By thewording and style of one of the writers of the notations, Dr. Jessup concludedthat the writer was the sameperson who had written him about the Philadelphia Experiment. It was also thesetwo officers whopersonally had the book retyped and who arranged for the publication, intypewritten form, of 25 copies.The officers and their personal belongings have left ONR many years ago, and wedo not have even a filecopy of the annotated book.The Office of Naval Research never conducted an official study of themanuscript. As for thePhiladelphia Experiment itself, ONR has never conducted any investigations oninvisibility, either in 1943or at any other time. (ONR was established in 1946.) In view of presentscientific knowledge, our scientistsdo not believe that such an experiment could be possible except in the realm ofscience fiction. A scientificdiscovery of such import, if it had in fact occurred, could hardly remain secretfor such a long time ...In 1969, following years of unsuccessful efforts to locate him, Allen/Allendesuddenly walked into the offices ofthe Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO) in Tucson, Arizona and saidthat his annotations to the Varoedition of Jessup’s book [i.e. the annotations which so interested the two ONRofficers] had been a hoax.For casual PE enthusiasts, that ended everything right there. Interestinglyenough, however, Allende at no timerepudiated the account of the PE as contained in his letters to Jessup. [Later,in fact, he retracted his “confession”,saying that it had been motivated purely by a desire to keep sensationalistauthor Brad “Steiger” Olson fromcapitalizing on the Varo annotations.] To Moore, Allende recently elaboratedconcerning the PE:I watched the air all around the ship ... turn slightly, ever so slightly darkerthan all the other air ... Isaw, after a few minutes, a foggy green mist arise like a thin cloud. I thinkthis must have been a mist ofatomic particles. I watched as thereafter the DE 173 [the Eldridge] becamerapidly invisible to human eyes.And yet the precise shape of the keel and underhull of that ship remainedimpressed into the ocean water asit and my own ship [the S.S. Andrew Furuseth] sped along somewhat side by sideand close to inboards.Yes, today I can tell it, but then who cares ...Curiously enough, the logbooks of both the Eldridge and the Andrew Furusethcovering the August-December1943 period are missing. The Eldridge itself was transferred to the Greek navyin 1951, renamed the Lion, and isapparently still in service. Its official wartime history, according to NavyDepartment records, is also unremarkable:normal convoy duty, appropriate for a destroyer escort. One of Moore’sconfidential sources, a Navy Commanderwho had served as a scientist in the Navy’s radar research program during WorldWar II, commented:I believe they did succeed in getting a ship out of Philadelphia or Newark for alimited time, probablynot more than two or three weeks, and I think I heard they did some testing bothalong the Delaware Riverand off the coast, especially with regard to the effects of a strong magneticforce field on radar detectionapparatus. I can't tell you much else about it or about what the resultsultimately were because I don't know.My guess, and I emphasize guess, would be that every kind of receiving equipmentpossible was put aboardother vessels and along the shoreline to check on what would happen on the“other side” when both radioand low- and high-frequency radar were projected through the field. Undoubtedlyobservations would alsohave been made as to any effects that field might have had on light in thevisual range. In any event, I doknow that there was a great deal of work being done on total absorption as wellas refraction, and this wouldcertainly seem to tie in with such an experiment as this.One of the people cited as a source in the second Allende letter was a “Dr.Franklin Reno”, a WWII governmentscientist whom Moore claims to have tracked down and interviewed, again with theprovision that his real name notbe revealed. Concerning his involvement with the PE in its planning stages,“Reno” stated to Moore:Among the side effects [of the PE] would be a “boiling” of the water, ionizationof the surrounding air,and even a “Zeemanizing” of the atoms ... One of the problems involved was thatthe ionization created bythe field tended to cause an uneven refraction of the light ... According to ourcalculations, the result wouldnot be a steady mirage effect, but rather a “moving back and forth” displacementcaused by certain inherenttendencies of the AC field which would tend to create a confused area ratherthan a complete absence ofcolor.The “Zeeman effect” consists of the breaking of single spectral lines in the EMspectrum into three or morepolarized components when a source of radiation is placed in a magnetic field.This “moving rainbow” effect is- 388 -illustrated rather impressively in the 1984 film, I might add, and may havesomething to do with “Reno’s”recollection that the code name for the PE was Rainbow.What is the significance of the Philadelphia Experiment, other than that ittends to reinforce the warnings of Dr.Becker [cf. Appendix #62] concerning the harmful results of intense EM radiationon living beings?First, to the extent that Allende's account is at all credible, the effects ofextremely high-level EM radiation, suchas would have been generated aboard the Eldridge, can include molecularbreakdown, spontaneous combustion,and - most difficult to conceptualize - the temporary or permanent displacementin four-dimensional space of thegenerated field [and anything within it].It doesn’t make sense to talk of “fourth-dimensional time-travel”, as is shownin the film; the fourth dimensiondoesn’t operate as some sort of weird “escape hatch”. It is simply themeasurement of an object’s extension in orduration in time in comparison with an arbitrarily-chosen object of reference[for example, Einstein’s light velocity],without which a definition according to the first three dimensions ismeaningless.Newtonian physics (phenomena caused by particles banging against particles) waseventually overwhelmed byEinsteinian physics (the cosmos explained in terms of fields, with “particles”ultimately explainable as merelyintensely-concentrated fields). For awhile there remained a rat in the woodpile,however, as no one was quite surewhat a “field” actually was, if in fact there is “nothing banging around” in it.The 19th century Scottish physicist/mathematician James Maxwell, famous for calculating the field-relationshipbetween electricity and magnetism,hypothesized some kind of “ether” as a carrying medium. The Michelson-Morleyexperiment appeared to rule out“ether”, leaving fields defined [if you can call it a definition!] as “themanifestation of an electromagneticphenomenon or electric wave”.The smashing of the atom appeared to vindicate Einstein’s view of the universe;it now seemed possible toreduce everything to force-fields. The General Theory of Relativity (GTR) can becondensed into the proposition thatnuclear and electromagnetic energy are inter-changeable and mathematicallyinterconnected.But Einstein had his own woodpile-rat: the Unified Field Theory (UFT), by whichhe had hoped to prove theinterchangeability of electromagnetic fields with gravity (which he considered afield phenomenon). This wouldhave tied the entire objective universe together in a nice, neat, Einsteinianpackage. He finally abandoned the UFTin 1929 after ten years’ struggling with it. Reason: Gravity didn't cooperate bybehaving like a field. [Forget casualtalk about “gravitational fields”.] Einstein decided he didn’t need gravity tomake the GTR work [since no one elseknew what made gravity work either], and that was curtains for the UFT.The GTR has since taken a body blow with the advent of quantum physics, in whichthe movement of light,hence fields, has been traced to ultimate “packets” or quanta of mass/energycalled photons. [Near miss, Maxwell!]We are back to Newton, but to a weird kind of Newton wherein the “ultimateobjective universe” is a continually-fluid “soup” of interchanging quanta, which are themselves changing in internalproportion, if not in absolute value(the photon).The current generation of physicists are nevertheless as deeply commited to theGTR as those of Columbus’ daywere to a flat Earth, so there are a lot of exercises underway under the generalheading of jamming the stepsister’sfoot into Cinderella’s glass slipper - such as “curved space”, which to Einsteincritics like Nikola Tesla was/is anidiotic notion: Because of the coexistence of action & reaction, Tesla pointedout, all “curvature” would becounteracted by “straightening”.Anyway, the discovery of the photon has engendered a snipe hunt for thehypothetical “graviton”, presumablyleading to a quantum-mechanics-era UFT and a Nobel Prize. Lots of scientistshave yelled “Bingo!”, but to date noone’s actually produced a winning card. Gravity remains mysterious. DisappointedBingo-players have shrugged offtheir failure by saying, shucks, it’s just because gravitons are so small, whichis because gravity is such a weak force.Well, it’s strong enough to keep the 18.5 mile/second speeding Earth (with aspecific gravity of 5.417) fromzooming off into space. And it obviously gets “stronger” as mass increases[which must have tantalized Einsteinbecause of the field-implications], but not necessarily as distance decreases -which screws up “field” notions. Fields,moreover, can be escaped entirely, since they curve back into themselves [whichexplains why Einstein’s theoretical“field universe” is sometimes over-simplified into a gigantic donut intextbooks]. Gravity cannot be escaped; thespace shuttle’s seeming freedom” from it, for example, is the result of itscounteraction by tremendous orbital speed- in other words, the old “force = mass x acceleration” equation you learned inhigh school. And Sol hangs on toPluto just as surely as it does Earth.All of which digression is to say that the energy force responsible for thephenomenon of gravity is stillunidentified. If in fact the underlying premise of the UFT - that all kinds ofquanta are interchangeable - is true, andthe known behavior of gravity suggests that it is, the manipulation of EM ornuclear energy in certain ways shouldaffect and/or activate certain kinds of gravitational-energy phenomena.Is this what happened in the Philadelphia Navy Yard in October 1943? In theprocess of attempting to deflectradar waves by generation of an extraordinarily-strong EM field around theEldridge, did momentary transmutationaccidentally occur into another energy medium entirely - that responsible forthe binding-together of mass, i.e.gravity?When the forces governing the cohesion of lowly little atoms are disrupted in acertain way, the result is anatomic explosion of astonishing power. What could be the consequences if“gravitons” were “smashed”? Notnecessarily anti-gravity; in fact that would presumably require ahighly-channeled and controlled application of thetechnique. More probably the uncontrolled release of gravitational energy in anymanner of unsuspected- 389 -distortions, among which could very possibly be the momentary dislocation of theEldridge into what quantum-physicists call a “wormhole” and consequent disruption of certain molecularequivalences in the organicconstitutions of the humans aboard [hence the “freezing” and “burning” incidentsreported by Allende].If so, why - as the Navy form-letter so reasonably suggests - wouldn’t anythinghave come of the PE beyond ashort-sighted coverup? First of all, wartime experimental research was orientedtowards results that seemed topromise quick applications in support of victory [hence the Manhattan Project].If the Philadelphia Experiment hadproduced a workable radar-blind for ships or aircraft, it might have madeheadlines. But dematerializing ships andfreezing/burning sailors would simply mean failure in terms of war-utilization.It is not implausible that such anincident would result in the project’s abrupt termination and a coverup of thedisaster to the personnel involved.And later, after the war, why no further experiments in the same vein? For onething, as noted above, quantumphysics is still trying to get its act together: to understand the observeduniverse. The PE might well be “unexploredand unexplained”, hence simply ignored. And if it is indeed a hyper-classifiedincident, the independent scientificcommunity would not have knowledge of or access to any substantive documentationconcerning the calculations,equipment, or results. A few “van Däniken-style” paperback accounts and a“science-fiction” movie are not the stuffaround which research grants are assembled. Nevertheless, says Moore:One of Charles Berlitz’ informants, who emphatically declined to be named,confided to Berlitz that hehad seen highly classified documents in the Navy files in Washington, D.C. whichindicated that at leastsome phases of the experiments are still in progress._____________Comment 2010Note #1The United States Navy’s official Philadelphia Experiment-debunking page ishere:https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/p/philadelphia-experiment.htmlThe most extensive Philadelphia Experiment-supporting page is here:http://www.softwareartist.com/philexp.htmlNote #2Science Daily (August 11, 2008) - Scientists at the University of California,Berkeley, have for the first timeengineered 3-D materials that can reverse the natural direction of visible andnear-infrared light, a developmentthat could help form the basis for higher resolution optical imaging,nanocircuits for high-powered computers, and,to the delight of science-fiction and fantasy buffs, cloaking devices that couldrender objects invisible to the humaneye.Two breakthroughs in the development of metamaterials - composite materialswith extraordinary capabilitiesto bend electromagnetic waves - are reported separately this week in the August13 advanced online issue of Nature,and in the August 15 issue of Science …[index-390_1.jpg]- 390 -Note #3[index-391_1.jpg]- 391 -- 392 -A66: The Order of Amon- by R.

This isdone so that a full comprehension can be achieved of why our emotional self(heart) has the potential to be socomplementary to Black Magic.A prerequisite for utilization of the heart is a thorough initiatoryself-examination, so that the one may trulybegin to feel, see, and know one’s self completely. This particular method ofinitiation is absolutely brutal in itsdelivery. Often we only think we see, feel, or sense the truth within. TheAmonian eventually learns to use all senseswith great deliberation and with a new clarity of purpose.The Order of Amon provides an environment of breath and fire (strength throughwilled transmutation) toassist the Initiate in eliminating/transforming all that is not essential to theGift of Set. Further assisting in thecreation of the core self, the personal philosophic aspects that are thecumulative efforts and results of Xeper arerepeatedly purified by the Fire of Amon. To say that this particular method ofinitiation is difficult would be anunderstatement. It is perhaps one of the most difficult of all. For this veryreal journey is one into the darkest andmost hidden areas of our selves that are seldom realized.Adepts II° will work within the Order of Amon in a manner that is befitting selfactualization through creativeintelligence. The Order is open to Adepts II°+ who have communicated anddemonstrated a sincere reason to workin this particular environment.Magical practices will remain somewhat personal, since each Initiate possessestalents and abilities that areuniquely their own. Guidelines will be put in place so that the Initiate learnsto extract the best from these talentsand abilities. This will be experienced through the destructive Fire of Amonthat is a hidden aspect of the Order andwhich will become known to the Initiate while moving closer to the Order’s InnerSanctum. In time a certain purityof being will emerge from this process, and this purity will transform theInitiate sufficiently to become strongenough to reach for the Grail of all understanding.Only through obliteration of the Universe that is may man seal his Mastery ofthe Black Flame, for onlythus may he know that he is not subject to a greater Will.- Statement of Leviathan, The DiaboliconAnd alone I cannot preserve my Elect, but I would teach them and strengthentheir Will against thecoming peril, that they and their Blood may endure.

Initiates should work in a manner befitting and complementingself-actualization through creativeintelligence, beginning at the beginning. In this manner imperfection isdestroyed through the destructive fires ofthe more hidden aspects of the Order, which will surface only throughself-created purity.

Then begins the next step ...My voice reaches unto Hermonthis: Amon responds to my invocation: He stretchesforth his hand tome, and I rejoice: He calls out from behind me, “I am rushing towards thee ...to thee, Meriamn! I am withthee. It is I, thy Father: My hand is with thee. I am the Lord of Strength,Lover of Valor.” I have found acourageous heart, and I am content. All that I desire will come to pass!- The King of Pharaonic TheocracyThere is no truth but what is! The true illusion is what one sees! The mostobvious lie is that which one is surehe knows to be true!- 395 -A67: The Order of Anpu- by Linda Reynolds IV°, Grand MasterBriefly, the purpose of the Order of Anpu will be to uncover the true BlackMagical dynamics of thevarious aspects of the Opener of the Way which may be buried deep within theInitiate’s most hidden self. Achallenge proclaimed in the ancient language of Wepwawet can only result inthose veils of self-deceit beinglifted away, secret issues forced, silent weaknesses exposed and disposed of -the true magiciantransformed, empowered, and armed with clear vision.This is how my announcement was worded in the August 1993 issue of the Scroll ofSet. I then went on to saythat I would clarify that statement at Set-XIV. To do so, however, would be anattempt to condense all theknowledge I’ve gathered throughout my years in the Temple of Set and put it allon a couple of sheets of paper. Askilled wordsmith may find that a simple task; I am not a wordsmith. What I am,however, is one of the people you’llencounter in life who can show you some truths about yourself! This is thefocus, the culmination of my Work alongthe Path all these years. It is my only concern; my only life’s Work; the reasonfor and purpose of the Order of Anpu.We shall pursue this truth in different ways: some extremely mysterious andceremonial, others straightforwardand more conventional. Some will be personal and confrontational, others simpleand easily accessible. The routesare varied, including the exploration of time, our manipulation of it, itsimpact on our lives and Work, etc. We shallalso explore the “alien being” that dwells within and nearby each of us - the“Self ahead of self” as you’ve probablyheard it described - and the implications of neter and magical names, theconnection with and utilization of theIsolate Intelligence - the ultimate access to that part of each of us that cansometimes remain elusive. Uncoveringtruth, Opening the Way, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary - allthe functions and Work of theancient sorcerer and the modern Black Magician and the multi-leveled connectionsbetween them shall be our taskand our pleasure!As the figure and language of Wepwawet was prominent to the ancient priesthoodsin a strategic sense(symbolizing the unification of the Egyptian state) so we of the Order of Anpushall create and utilize our own ritesand language to transform and unify ourselves on all planes of existence andperception, to understand and masterboth sides of the Abyss.Membership in the Order of Anpu shall be by invitation only (following apersonal conversation with the GrandMaster) and shall be offered to Initiates of the II° and above who express aninterest. Since the Work of the Order ofAnpu is complementary to all the Work of the Temple of Set and its other Orders,dual Order membership is bypermission of the Grand Masters concerned.- 396 -A68: The Order of Bast- by Margaret A. Wendall IV°, Grand MasterThe Order of Bast is one of the oldest Orders in the Temple of Set. It began inthe Church of Satan as BubastisChapel and continued into the Year X as Bubastis Pylon. One thing which hasalways distinguished the Order of Bastis that its members have never been afraid to get our feet wet or incur the“wrath” of other Initiates by our studies.One of my goals in the Temple of Set was to re-create this Order; but when Ilooked at the mailing list, most of thenames were just this - names, not faces or voices. It has been difficult for meto communicate with “names”,although I realize each name is connected with a Being on a path at leastparallel, if not more or less identical to myown. I hesitated.At Set-V in Santa Cruz names became much more. Each Initiate who attended is myBrother or Sister andfriend. It will be much easier to communicate with you, and this is a real joyto me.Therefore it is with great pleasure that I announce the re-creation of the Orderof Bast - with a change. Bast, theLady of Life, is interested in the quality of our lives. Isn’t your own Bastinterested in how your life is going, if for noother reason than when she purrs for a grumpy Setian, it’s to cheer you up andprompt you to try harder?The new Order of Bast will be devoted to the study of modern technology and howit affects us as Setians. Wewill ask and try to answer the following kinds of questions [which are generalbut not exclusive]:1. How does modern technology affect our lives, both magical and mundane?2. How can we adapt to this new technology? Should we? Must we?3. How can we adapt modern technology to our advantage, both as individuals andas the Temple of Set?We had an excellent answer to the last question at the Conclave Rite ofRecognition of Stephen Flowers as aPriest of Set. He could not attend the Conclave in Santa Cruz; hence the Ritewas held simultaneously in Santa Cruzand in Texas, via speakerphone. Those of us in Santa Cruz heard Priest Flowers,and he and his Pylon heard thePriesthood assembled on the West Coast. It was a very magical moment. No longerare we strangers or names on alist. I feel as though I have known Priest Flowers all my life. Those of usattending this Rite used modern technologyto achieve this Black Magic.Other areas we could explore are: (1) sending our Word and words into outerspace and examining the results,(2) robotics, (3) medicine, (4) electronic mail, (5) artificial intelligence,and (6) an infinite number of other equally-interesting technological endeavors. A television ad for a computer magazinesums up the Magical Quest of theOrder of Bast: “The possibilities are endless.”- 397 -A69: The Order of Beelzebub- by Paul F. McAtee IV°, Grand MasterIn the Chinese Year of the Goat, following the Dog Days of Sirius and in clearview from the planet Mars, theEsoteric Order of Beelzebub came into being.Beelzebub, a persona of antiquity, is a well-known figure throughout Westernoccult literature, by means of suchsources as the Götia. However within the context of the EOB, it is noted thatacross the Middle East and Persia ofancient times the name had a much different meaning than is now commonly known.For instance, amongst thePhilistines Beelzebub was associated with the Sun, which also brought the flies,resulting in his popular title “Lordof the Flies”. An even older version of the name, “Ba’al Zebul”, is translatedas “Lord of the Mansion” or “Master ofthe Dwelling”. This latter translation is of special significance to the work ofthe Order.It has been said that man in his ordinary mechanical state is like unto amansion where the master of the estateis gone away on business or vacation and the staff is unsure of precisely whenhe will return. Thus the staff beginsbehaving in ways they never would is the master were present. The gardener letsthe foliage grow wildly, the butlertries on the master’s clothing in an effort to mimic his authority, while thekitchen staff prepare uncommon dishesat all hours of the day, and so on. Just as mice will play while the cat isaway, order can be restored to the mansiononly by the master’s return.Man’s position in the universe is very much like this. Without a single andpermanent “I” or “master” to takecommand and order his inner state of affairs, his life is goverened mostly bywhims, false personalities, andunconscious reactions. Emotions may try to do the work of the intellect, theintellect may try to do the work of thebody, and so forth. Without a master a man’s house falls quickly into a state ofdisarray, and in such a state it is veryunlikely that the man will accomplish anything meaningful for himself. Just asonly the master can return his ownhouse to order, only a single and governing “I” can return the self to order.Work in the EoB prepares one’s mansion for the return of its master.AimThe aim of the EOB is toward the question of self-consciousness, in connectionwith and by means of, the Æonicword Xeper. To “Come Into Being” in this sense may also be taken as “to comeinto a state of conscious being”.Consciousness, from the point of view of the EOB, is the result of an effortdrawn from the totality of one’s being, toinclude not only one’s thoughts but also one’s feelings, sensation, and physicalpresence. Xeper, then, is not only anintellectual effort, but a process engaging the entirety of one’s being.If the Gift of Set is a gift of conscious essence, then it is a gift ofpotential only. Man in his ordinary stategenerally assumes he possesses such things as consciousness or will. However itmay be quickly demonstrated by afew simple experiments that most common human functioning takes place on apurely non-conscious, mechanicallevel. From the point of view of the EOB, it is very important to realize thatsuch things as consciousness and willexist for us initially only as possibilities, for man is unable to work towardthat which he already believes himselfto possess. The Remanifestation of a higher, more “permanent” conscious state isgenerally only the result of muchwork and wish.Conditions for WorkKnowledge, from the point of view of the Order, refers to knowledge that canhelp man in his quest to becomehimself. Such knowledge is a very scarce resource in the world, and is generallyfound only in esoteric “schools”.While some religions in the world today may have had their origins in schools,it is nevertheless important torecognize certain distinctions in principle between “schools” and “religions”.For instance, in religion one’s beliefsare often the main focus. By contrast in a school one’s beliefs are not nearlyso important as what one might do, orwhat one might wish for.In a school one may come in contact with “esoteric knowledge”. Esotericknowledge is a body of ideas andteachings of a rather material/organic nature, disseminated almost entirely bymeans of direct interaction or oraltradition, by means of schools. Thus esoteric knowledge tends to travel inaccordance with the laws of accumulationand magnetism, more so than the conventional and often politically governedchannels of ordinary knowledge.Esoteric knowledge often seems to transmit something more than the sum total ofwords spoken, and can act almostlike “food” for higher states of being.While empires may crumble and libraries burn, esoteric knowledge survives bycovert passage from mouth toear and “essence-transmission” from teacher to student. The conditions of theworld in which we find ourselves arelargely mechanical and chaotic, offering little if any possibility for consciousevolution. Schools, unlike manyreligions, are often quite difficult to find – but when found, represent a greatopportunity as well as a greatchallenge. Indeed, finding a true school may require not only will and wish, buta bit of luck as well.The exoteric manifestation of the Temple of Set is as a religion, functioning inbroadly socio-political conditions.The esoteric manifestation of the Temple is as a school, functioning inexclusively metaphysical conditions. While- 398 -recognizing the absolute necessity of its exoteric manifestation, it is theTemple’s esoteric manifestation that formsthe circle of the EOB.- 399 -A70: Order of the Black Tower- by James B. Severson IV°, Grand MasterSymbolism of the TowerIn the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the tower is a determinative signdenoting height or the act of risingabove the common level of life and society. Basically the tower is symbolic ofascent (Essent).During the Middle Ages towers and belfries held the significance of watchtowers.But also, by the simpleapplication of symbolism of level (whereby material height implies spiritualelevation), they expressed the samesymbolism as the ladder - linking earth and heaven...1Since the idea of elevation and ascent (Essent), implicit in the tower, connotestransformation and evolution,the athanor (the alchemist’s furnace) was given the shape of a tower. Thissignified inversely that themetamorphosis of matter implied a process of ascent.Another symbol usually mentioned in this connection is the bronze tower in whichDiana, the mother ofPerseus, was imprisoned.Finally we would point out the analogy between the tower and man: Just as thetree is closer to the humanfigure than the horizontal forms of animals, so too is the tower the onlystructural form distinguished by verticality.Windows at the topmost level, almost always large in size, correspond to theeyes and the mind of man.1It is possible to discover a dual tendency in the symbolism of the tower. Itsupward impulse may beaccomplished by a deepening movement: the greater the height, the deeper thefoundations.Nietzsche talked of descent during ascent (Essent). Nerval (in Aurelia) refersto the symbolism of the tower andsaid: “I found myself in a tower, whose foundations were sunk deep into theearth, reaching up like a spire into thesky, that my whole existence already seemed bound to be consumed in climbing upand down.”1"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE ORDERWhat is the Order of the Black Tower, and what magical elements can be foundtherein?The symbol of the Tower has been, and continues to be a profound and enduringimage within a large variety ofmagical traditions.As a metaphor for the process of initiation in general, I have chosen this imageto further symbolize theemergence of an ancient and long-overlooked initiatory tradition: the VedicLeft-Hand Path. Examples are theKaula School of Tantrism and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. [“Vedic” refers to agrouping of initiatory texts entitledthe Veda, or simply “Knowledge” in Sanskrit. The actual written Veda was aproduct of India ca. 1500 to 800 BCE,but existed as an oral tradition for quite some time previous to those dates.]Within many traditions of the East, the concept of yoga is obviously a prevalentcore aspect. It has now becomeimportant that this term be defined in an entirely new light.Yoga and the Left-Hand Path“Yoga: ‘union’; a yoke; a process or path or displace leading to oneness withthe divine or with one’s self (fromthe root verb yuj (‘to unite, join, connect’); the state of oneness with theself, a god; the practice leading to thatstate.”4According to Shaiva Siddhanta it is a path to liberation characterized bycontemplation and internal worship. Itis called the path of friendship to a god ( sakha-marga). Its goal is gainingthe form of a god ( Sarupya) [SeeMoksha].4Moksha: “liberation: spiritual freedom: release: the final goal of human life(from the root verb moksh ‘toliberate’).”4Shaiva Siddhanta says that the path of release consists in carya, kriya, yoga,and jnana. In release the soulobtains its individuality. It becomes similar to a god. Thus release is unity induality. The soul enjoys a god’s nature,though it is not identical with any particular god.4“It isn’t over ’til it’s over.” This revelation is what separates Left-Hand Pathphilosophy from the greedyhedonism of the world. Non-players may think that the game tokens theyaccumulate, from a good car to a happymarriage, are signs they are winning. These are merely signs they are playingwell. In chess you may capture almostall of your opponent’s pieces, but you lose if your king is captured.Every moment of life must be connected with the permanent parts of yourself.This “yoking” of themany “I”s to your permanent self is yoga. This is different from Right-Hand Pathyoga, which seeksunification with the divine. The immutable part of oneself, the Kutashta, isawareness of one’s own- 400 -specialness, the whole. The word Kutashta, which implies “permanent”, literallymeans “to stand to thetop” (from kuta “summit” and stha “to stand”. This appears in the frequentWestern LHP yoga metaphor ofthe Black Tower.- Don Webb V°, “Moksa, or What do I Do when the World Sucks?”Setian Black YogaWhat I am beginning to define as “Setian Black Yoga” (SBY) is a process by whichthe laws of nature areintelligently and deliberately applied to daily life in order to consciouslyrealize one’s own isolate nature. SBY is alsobased on the theory that man is not his body alone: that the real spirit (Purusa) actually uses the body as aninstrument.In order for this to be a LHP truism, the presence of a “watcher” or witnessingelement within the mind mustfirst be located, then further enhanced.Singularity breeds further understanding and can afford the Black Magician anability to bind and/or separatethe forces within and beyond, for the purposes of willed intent.Dark TranscendenceDark Transcendence (DT) is the primary focus of the Order. Within the envelopeof Greater Black Magic, DTtakes a unique, but not necessarily uncommon approach.Utilizing the tools of SBY, DT is a four-fold process utilizing the body, themind, the emotions, and the spirit( psyche).Theoretically one’s isolate nature defines what clarity one would experience inany of the above four realms - themore the clarity, the more the possibility for initiatory balance. Here“balance” refers to the ability to draw upon theintegrative strength each realm can afford another.The Nine Schools of the OrderTo facilitate mastery of this process, the OBT offers Nine Schools of SBY as astarting point:1. Hatha, which is based on control of the physical body to open it to thecosmic energy by breathing andphysical exercises. [LHP concept: To engage the body as one of the principaltools in accessing &utilizing the isolate self.]22. Laya, which works on the psychic centers to awaken the primordial cosmicenergy of the individual(Kundalini). [LHP concept: To better understand how the these psychic centerscan effect the ability ofthe self to manifest within/into objectivity.]23. Mantra, which makes use of the repetition of certain words and phrases tosteady the mind. [LHP note:The use of specific magical formula, which empowers the isolate self towards agreater ability tomanifest within/into objectively.]2The above three work by operating from the outer periphery of consciousness toan inner center. The followingthree proceed from the inner self outwards:4. Jnana, which seeks to effect a resonance of inner and outer by a change ofthought, resulting from theattainment of a deeper understanding of both the objective and subjective (Yogaof Knowledge). [LHPconcept: The word union being replaced with resonance and/or “to Yoke”, whichimplies more of aseparate vantage-point, and reference for isolate control.]25. Bhakti, which seeks to effect a resonance by the change of one’s emotionalconsciousness throughdevotion to an ideal - or a First Principle as per Plato (Yoga of Devotion).[LHP concept: Devotion to theisolate self involving but not limited to: self-love, deserving compassion,compassionless love, etc.]26. Karma, which seeks to effect a resonance by which control of one’s actionsinitiate from within the coreself (Yoga of Action). [LHP concept: This is a “self” determined act.Specifically for the purposes ofgaining a greater understanding of that same self. In other words, to haveself-control is one of thegreatest challenges a Setian can continue to endeavor.]2All of the above six are embraced in:- 401 -7. Raja Yoga, one of the earliest and most scientific treatments of the subjectof self-transformation.[LHP concept: Raja Yoga is - for the most part, a mental and/or spiritualdiscipline, which requires anisolate perspective to be effective. It is here more so than anywhere else thatthe concept of “to Yoke” hasits greatest impact on the Adept. Union - or more specifically understanding,with regards to the isolateself is the critical differentiation which separates this form of Yoga from itsRHP cousins.]3In the Setian/LHP system of Yoga there are also two other schools - as mentionedabove, which are only nowbeing developed and extrapolated upon:8. Luciferian which seeks to isolate the self in a context, which transcends thefacade of only the ego,towards a greater appreciation of the totality of the psyche.9. Meta which seeks to transcend that very subjectivity, which provides theinitial vehicle for LHPliberation. [Facilitator’s note: This is the SBT’s version of the mystery of theRed Magus. Thank you,Order of Leviathan.]Structure and OperationAs is the general guideline for the entire Temple of Set, OBT affiliation isrestricted to II°+ Initiates. Allinterested Initiates are encouraged to first contact a member of the Orderbefore actually contacting the GrandMaster. The reasons for this are many, so I’ll only mention a few here:One of the greatest gifts an Order can give its members is the opportunity formagical and/or initiatorypersonalization. The GM has already created a specified path for himself, thusthe formation of the Order. But theactive member has - in most cases, just begun. And his perspective can be bothvarious as well as personally unique.Depending on one’s level of knowledge and proficiency, it is also good to startfrom a platform of somewhatfamiliarity - like that of a similar degree or interest level, before attemptinganything unfamiliar.Once contact has been established, the process of acceptance will take as longas is needed for each individualcandidate.Structures of the OrderThe PeristyleThe outer courtyard of ancient temples was sometimes called a Peristyle. A placein which the novices wouldcongregate and study - a place of introduction, which could further specifyvarious types of further advancement...For those who find this magical concept intriguing, but do not have significantand/or a developed backgroundin general Yogic processes, they would begin their journey here. Even those whowould have a developedbackground, but have not yet integrated such a tool within the general conceptof Setian philosophy, would alsobegin here.The Inner TempleIn those same ancient temples of antiquity, the concept of entrance into theInner Temple was a process ofadvanced education, as well as great initiatory understanding.The Inner Temple of the OBT will represent a definitive personalization of theinitiate’s process within theOrder, specifically based upon the concepts of LHP initiation and the Temple ofSet proper.The school of Left-Hand Path Yoga is about creating suitable companions for thePrince of Darkness. It will behard Work to create such a School in the West, but hard Work is the path of thedeified human as opposed to theoccult culture bum.Information Sources within the OBTThe Third EyeThe OBT will report its experiments and/or magical discoveries to the Templethrough a newsletter: The ThirdEye. It will be published approximately three to four times a year. All theactive membership will be expected tocontribute to this publication on a regular basis.This publication will be made available to all Pylon Sentinels and Masters ofthe Temple free of charge. All otherinitiates would be asked for a donation of US$3 per issue to cover the costs ofprinting and postage. [Yearlysubscriptions are available upon request.]The Black Tower Chronicles- 402 -At the end of each year the Order will produce a single volume of informationchronicling its endeavors. Anyinterested Temple initiates - regardless of Order affiliation & holding at leastthe Degree of Adept, are welcome topurchase any of these volumes for the cost of printing and postage.

Iitti IV°, Grand Master"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThe Order of the Great Bear came into being on the traditional northern day ofthe bear, on the 13th of July,XXXVIII Æon of Set. This day of the year was celebrated as a day of midsummer, asummer solstice by pre-Christian northern people. It was a special day dedicated to honor the celestialbear who was considered theancestor of humans, a sacred being residing beyond the seven stars of the BigDipper.Now the cycle of that old occasion has been touched from within the Æon of Set,and the great bear, an ancientmagical entity sacred to the Isolate Intelligence in the North, is honored bythe creation of the Order of the GreatBear of the Temple of Set.Lineage of the OrderFurtherance of the Temple of Set in the North since XXVI ÆS has enchanted thebear to surface as the ancientmagical entity sacred to the Isolate Intelligence in that part of the world.Historically bear cults are known to have existed in the same basic formsthroughout northern regions of theworld for thousands of years. In these cults the bear was considered as a sacredbeing who often resided beyond theconstellation of the Big Dipper and who was the ancestor of humans: the firstshaman.Bears’ link with humans was celebrated in an annual bear ceremony that markedrenewal of the link betweenthe bear and humans. The ceremony stood for the vitalizing power which the bearbrought with him from his sacredabode beyond the borders of profane existence.The bear was considered to be an entity of borderlands, an entity embodying thesacred power that residesbeyond the borders of the known areas. It can be deduced that the bearsymbolized power of change as opposed tothe status quo that manifested within the known areas of existence.The bear was, and still is, the most powerful and Set-like animal, in myth andnature, in the North. In this spiritthe Order of the Great Bear emphasizes Isolate Intelligence’s manifestation asexplorer of borderlands, separator ofprofane from sacred, and embodiment of the Highest of Life.Within the Temple of Set there are several elements that as special schools ofinitiation have been essential forthe Grand Master in his path of Becoming and accordingly in his formation of theOrder of the Great Bear. Theseelements include (now closed) the Heart Element and the Order of Amon inrelation to teachings of Heart, Order ofthe Trapezoid and the Arkte Element in relation to dynamic manifestation ofone’s Work in the world, and Orders ofVampyre and the Black Tower in their general emphasis of cultivating body-psyche-relationship in one’s Work. Alsothe closed Order of the Claw of the Bear needs to be mentioned due to itscultural context and the Grand Master’sclose working relationship to it.The vision of the Order of the Great Bear started to open throughKarhunpeijaiset, the Bear Ceremony, that waswritten by the Grand Master as the Arkte Working for the Helsinki Conclave inXXXVII ÆS.Contexts of WorkThe Work in the Order takes place within two general contexts, those ofHyperborea and Heart. Thesecontexts can be seen as separate, but within the Order they are essentiallysubtly interwoven, forming the generalapproach the Order has to initiation. The central goal in using these contextsis the same as the central goal of everyOrder of the Temple; that of furthering Xeper.The context of Hyperborea gives emphasis to all circumpolar and northerncultures in general (European,American, Asian) as sources of magical inspiration for an Initiate’s work. TheOrder is a tool for furthering study,use, and recreation of magical methods and traditions of the North from theLeft-Hand Path point of view. Ofspecial importance for the Order in this area is shamanism.The context of Heart is interwoven with the context of Hyperborea because thefirst emerged through theGrand Master’s work with the second.The context of Heart refers first and foremost to a holistic approach toinitiation and to cultivatingunderstanding of the religious dimension of one’s Xeper. An Initiate of theOrder seeks systematically to challengeherself in theory and in practice in realms of body, persona, and mind asappropriate in her pursuing of initiation.She also seeks to cultivate understanding and sovereignty of a larger picture ofher life, everything initiatorilyrelevant that takes place between natural birth and death; in past, present, andpotential future. Essentially relatedto this, she simultaneously seeks to strengthen her separate, non-natural selfand its psyche centric existenceunbound by laws of the objective universe.- 404 -Structure and OperationThe Order consists of its inner and outer hall. Every Initiate of the Order isautomatically a member of theouter hall. Entry into the inner hall is acquired through mastering an area ofwork relevant to the focus of the Orderand recognized as such by the Grand Master.The Order hosts two Heart Sumbles each year, during the summer and wintersolstice. These workings aretools to bind an Initiate’s vertical ( physis, persona, psyche) and horizontal(past, present, and potential future)realms of existence meaningfully together in her efforts to Xeper. A Sumble is aformula to dynamically bind anInitiate’s subjective universe with objective universe. It emphasizes one’s willand its concrete manifestations in theworld.Related to the theme of the Heart Sumble, the Order runs a project called theBook of Life. The project consistsof writing an initiatory autobiography, accompanied with related workings.Communication in the Order occurs mostly via its e-list. The Order’s newsletterBoreas is published twice ayear. Book of the Great Bear, the Order book, is a collection of writingsrecording work and central teachings of theOrder.AffiliationAffiliation with the Order takes place via dialogue with the Grand Master. Acandidate, a II°+ Initiate, isexpected to express appropriately why she seeks affiliation with the Order, whatshe seeks to achieve through workin the Order, and how she expects to attain those goals.Work in the Order is naturally individualistic, but there are certainexpectations that the Grand Master has ofthe Order’s Initiates. An Initiate of the Order is expected:• To take part in at least one Heart Sumble per year, and accordingly to shareone’s work with the GrandMaster and in Order’s forums as appropriate.• To create a personal Book of Life and to share related insights with the GrandMaster and in the Order’sforums as appropriate.• To attend international Conclave at least once in five years. The Orderemphasizes communication thatoccurs in person and prefers it whenever possible.Experience of the Heart is to experience linking various facets of one’sexistence meaningfully together in one’sefforts to Xeper. It is about creating and experiencing profound meaning fromone’s most potent self via act of will.It is about dynamically experiencing and embodying the Highest of Life.There is an Aurora Borealis of an individual’s will under the constellation ofArktos!

Graeb IV°, Grand MasterThe Order of Horus was established at the Heb Sed Festival of the Temple of Set,year XXX of the Æon of Set. InEgypt the Heb Sed Festival involved a ritual and symbolic joining of the twopowers: Horus and Set - Upper andLower Egypt. The Order of Horus was established to make manifest the neterHarWer, or Horus the Elder/the GreatCelestial Horus, the brother of Set.The Order of Horus focuses upon power and is for those who, like the ancientpharaohs, would take the FalconGod as an emblem of their personal and unique power. As the Order of Horusinvolves a number of individuals andnot just a single pharaoh, the members of the Order of Horus are nobles, theprinces of Set. As in any order ofnobility, the members of the Order wield power and assume commensurateresponsibilities.As power is not to be confused with force, it is important to clearlydistinguish these two ideas. The idea ofpower is that which can flow from a non-corporeal entity, such as an individual,an ideal, or an æonic Word. Forexample, words such as Xeper, Remanifest, and Runa all carry a great deal ofpower but do not entail force. The useof brute force is antithetical to real power, as real power takes effect byvirtue of itself. Hence no one would forceanother to accept an individual, an ideal, or an æonic Word.The Order of Horus is also concerned with action. Action can be thought of aspart of a threefold scheme ofprinciples:1. Consciousness: reflective awareness, reasoning, and the ultimate nature of anindividual. This mayalso be thought of as an aspect of the Gift of Set.2. Action: the power to make manifest or to cause change, creation, andself-unfolding, as well as theability to extend consciousness both inward and outward. This may also bethought of as an aspect ofthe Power of Horus.3. Skills: the principle of taking on, changing, or terminating skills. In thesubjective universe these arethe skills of thought, feeling, and behavior. In the objective universe theseskills become the “laws” ofnature or the way things occur, subject to the workings of magic.The Order of Horus is a Left-Hand Path initiatory Order, and works with allthree of these principles. Thenobles of the Order of Horus are psychecentric individuals striving forinitiation and immortality. By refining theGift of Set, each Initiate further develops the first principle. All initiation,action, and magical practices within theOrder of Horus are designed to further this Left-Hand Path initiation intoselfhood.This initiatory work is furthered by the second principle: the taking of action.By taking action one’s sense of selfis reinforced and further defined. When an individual acts, he affirms himselfas the creator and cause of the actionand its result. By extending and manifesting one’s own unique selfhood into thesubjective and objective universes,nobles of the Order of Horus further both their selves and their power.The Order of Horus is further based upon the third principle, which involvesself-control and -mastery. Withthis principle the workings of magic and yoga take place as the Initiatedevelops new skills that further individualinitiation, and casts off old and unwanted habits that limit initiation. In itswork with the third principle, the Orderof Horus includes all forms of operative magic, yoga, and related fields,including traditional initiatorymethodologies as well as modern and postmodern methods.The Order of Horus includes, but does not limit itself to a Left-Hand Pathtraining curriculum based on AleisterCrowley’s A.'.A.'. The primary difference between the Order of Horus system andthe traditional A.'.A.'. is that theOrder of Horus assumes that its initiates will choose to become “Black Brothers”and enter the City of the Pyramidsas self-made and -defined Initiates. Hence the Order of Horus is not tied to anantiquated notion of initiation thatrequires teachers and students.As many people are familiar with the O.T.O. and similar organizations, it isimportant to distinguish the Orderof Horus from them. First, while the Order of Horus includes Thelema as an æonicWord, its scope within the Orderis primarily restricted to workings dealing with the third principle of skill.Secondly and more importantly, theOrder of Horus is a Left-Hand Path organization which employs Right-Hand Pathmethodologies only as useful toindividual Initiates.The Order of Horus maintains an internal hierarchy based on a nine-grade system.However this hierarchy issubordinate to each member of the Order, regardless of grade, being treated as anoble and of equal dignity withevery other member of the Order. Hence members of the Order are all equal in thesense of a college of peers orfraternal order.The Order of Horus views itself as an Order based on power, action, andcreation. The Order is primarilyconcerned with the initiation of its members and the sharing of initiatorymethodologies. Adepts II°+ of the Templeof Set may apply by writing to the Grand Master. The Order of Horus is selectivein its membership, and applicantsshould have one or more areas of initiatory expertise with which they haveworked or wish to work.- 406 -A73: The Occult Institute of Technology- by Roger L. Whitaker IV°, Grand MasterThe roots of the Occult Institute of Technology (OIT) began with the developmentof the National Satanic BBSor NSBBS. This was a plain old telephone system (POTS) BBS (no Internet, noWorld Wide Web) that I created as apersonal reaction to the spread of “SRA” misinformation. In terms of content theNSBBS had a few essays written bySetians, the intro letter, some download files, and copies of interesting listmail. All of this was operated on aCommodore 128 (remember those days?) with a mere two floppy drives.As I developed the NSBBS system, I realized that the patterns of my personalthinking, and active work as aTemple of Set Initiate, revolved around art and certain types of technology.Eventually I understood that thepractical function of these interests was to develop and promote Lesser BlackMagical and Greater Black Magicalritual/working areas. I called this particular approach techno-magic andcontinued to disseminate essays about itthrough computer bulletin boards - mostly hacker and phreak sites - throughoutthe 1980s.As I became more sensitive to my techno-magical interests, I wanted the NSBBS tomore accurately reflect mypersonal initiatory bias. The result was my coming up with the moniker “OccultInstitute of Technology” or “OIT”.With this I had created a sigil that represented my understanding that there isa responsibility to maintain anequilibrium between the advances of knowledge (in general) and the techniques ofself transformation (specifically).Additionally OIT was and still is an extension of my own psyche in a verydetailed manner.Near the end of the 1980s the NSBBS permanently closed. However I retained theorganizational title andmagical ideas that were formed through the Occult Institute of Technology (OIT).It was during the 1990s that OIT became a Lodge within the Order of theTrapezoid, operating within theparameters of the Mad Lab Angle of the Spectrum of the Trapezoid.Later during this period of time I went on a personal hiatus from the Temple ofSet. This brought to me quietmoments in which I began to sense the mechanical nature of the universe throughthe paradigm of resonance. Itwas through this synthetically engineered perspective that the Setian conceptsof isolate intelligence became veryclear to me. By understanding the nature of the mechanical structure of theuniverse (through resonance), Iglimpsed its shadow - which I have perceived as the very essence of non-naturalconsciousness.With my eventual return to the Temple of Set mainstream, and with the advent ofthe House system within theOrder of the Trapezoid, I remanifested the OIT as a cyber House within thatOrder. This took form as a large websitewhich to date has had thousands of visitors, and which has been directlyresponsible for numerous individualsseeking out and joining the Temple of Set. The House of OIT was set up to act asa “magnetic” center (inOuspenskian terms), drawing into it those individuals who had an affinity forthe ideas of the LHP as understood bythe Temple of Set.In 1998 1 retired from the Order of the Trapezoid as a Master Emeritus in orderto develop a new Order withinthe Temple of Set - the Occult Institute of Technology. It is with this documentthat I officially announce that OIT ismanifest as an Order within the Temple of Set. However there are many aspectsregarding the Occult Institute thatyou need to understand before considering any form of affiliation. The followinginformation will provide a morecomplete understanding of OIT.From out of Chaos emerges Art. OIT is an antinomian-based perusal of the conceptof isolate intelligence asunderstood through the laws of resonance. It is our belief that the Left-HandPath experience is a three-fold life longprocess. This process consists of repeating periods of extension, retraction,and synchronization of ideas, principles,and personal synthesis. From the results and interactions of these three pointsof activity, a ladder of ideas formswithin the Initiate. These ideas extend themself directly into the process ofinitiation as a guide to understanding theprocess itself. This is stepping into resonance.It is this ladder of ideas that I have set forth in our manual entitled TheTechnician’s Guide to the Left-HandPath. This book sets forth in clear detail the resonant paradigm that forms thebasis of OIT philosophy and magicalpractice. It is this guidebook that gives a concrete basis of Remanifestation asa vital and active causal principle. It isthis guide that explains the theoretical basis of “how” both ritual and themagical link operate. It is this book thatdetails the way in which resonance (through its harmonic properties) extendsprinciples and ideas through time.The Technician’s Guide provides - through a combination of symbol, metaphor, andmetaphysics - a practicalmanner in which the individual can view the universe and one’s relationship toit.The Occult Institute of Technology promotes a cause and effect understanding ofthe relationship between theprinciple of isolate intelligence and of the individuality of the self. Byunderstanding the constituent mechanism(resonance) of activity that is embedded within the very fabric of the universe,the Initiate can sense how theseactions are mirrored through a variety of purely human scenarios - culture,religion, politics, spirituality, and more.By understanding how these activities affect the Initiate’s life, the Initiatecan dissent from being a pawn in a cosmicgame to consciously utilizing the knowledge of personal observations to promotepersonal existence to desiredstates of being.The philosophical ideas of OIT are multi-faceted. They take into account thepaths of ideas that lead to, that leadaway from, and that synthesize or “branch” out from specific points of SetianLHP initiatory activity.- 407 -The basic premise of “acquiring” knowledge within OIT is based upon therecognition that a principle is acompletion and polarization of specific energy in the form of revelatoryprinciples and ideas. Understanding that aprinciple can neither become anymore, nor anything less, it is stable andtransformative through induction. In otherwords, as a principle is recognized, it can transform by revealing to theindividual knowledge that carries thepotential of self transformation.However the principle itself does not change; it remains stable and consistent.For example, from the Principleof Isolate Self Consciousness, knowledge of Being is extended. Once knowledge ofBeing is attained, one can Becomethat knowledge; one can then extend personal energy into future models viaindividual activity.As previously mentioned, the paradigm that OIT perceives its environment throughis that of resonance.Resonance is the essential mechanical principle behind all that humans perceivethrough their inborn senses, orthrough the mechanical and prosthetic extension of the senses. Resonance in itsactive state is a movement ofenergy; it extends its energy from a point, or retracts its energy towards apoint. It is this principle of extension andretraction of energies - in the form of pure abstraction, i.e., ideas, futurebecomings, affinities and so on - that liesbehind spiritually transformative experience.By understanding this resonant environment through its various components suchas harmony, timing,synchronicity, density, octaves etc., the Initiate can learn to manipulate thosefundamental activities to createdesired effects.Set is the God of the Future Becomings - SynchronicitySynchronicity means to become aligned with the first extension - the genesis ofisolate intelligence in its firstprimeval form. Synchronicity is stepping into the proper timing of the movementof ideas relevant to the SetianMystery.This synchronization results in a spiritual conversion - a major psychologicaltransformation that manifeststhroughout all the activities engaged within by the Initiate. It is suchtransformative states that the OIT wants to beable to replicate in terms of ritual environments that enhance, promote, andattract to it individuals capable ofachieving these states of extended consciousness.Let it be known only that which modifies specificity can be transmitted. This,in a practical sense, is what Xeperis all about. The alteration of specific states of consciousness createsremembrance, and movement toward newhorizons.Transmission is extension. Its remembrance - or its experience - is retractionor the temporary displacement offorward movement whose purpose is to create a self-definition. Thisself-definition does not occur unless one canstop and stand back from events and experience through a vehicle of a perceptualpotentiality and sensuousexperience. The flesh, sinew, nerve, and brain of the human is such a perceptualvehicle.That which observes consciously through it is a harmonic, or alignment with thatfirst surge of something intonothing (genesis). Sometimes the harmonic is in a perfect tune with thisoriginal extension. In other cases itbecomes dissonant and disperses its energy, thus becoming incapable of creatingmomentum. In either scenario, aclue as to “how” specific states of consciousness are possible is hinted at.If there is no resonance, then there is nothing. In such a theoreticalenvironment nothing could extend forth,nor retract back towards its causal source. This means that the possibility ofexperience, memory, time, andeventuality cannot occur. Conversely, resonance must be able to extend andpenetrate through the environment it isa partner within. Resonance that cannot penetrate through its environment isalso the same thing as nothing.The OIT approach to magic is both explanatory and revelatory. That is, it takesinto account and explains suchconcepts as the magical link, proxemic environments, consciousness extensionthrough prosthetic means, and totalenvironmental manipulation. The purpose is to create areas of influence thatpromote the extension ofindividualized consciousness into previously unexperienced perceptualparameters.Within these explanations lies a practical methodology that can be learned andapplied to the benefit of theindividual involved. The goals of self determination are solely the product of aconsciousness that is willfully, andforcefully following a series of clues, and mysteries (attracted by a type ofmagnetic polarity called affinity) tovarious conclusions.In light of this psychological aspect of initiation (psycho-initiatory state),we can easily understand that OIT hasno specific goals for its Initiates. Its fundamental reason for existing is toteach others how to utilize and manipulatethe phenomenology of resonance in order to create relevant personal strategiesfor the purpose of self growth andspiritual transformation.AffiliationOIT operates with both an inner peristyle and outer peristyle aspect. What thismeans is that interestedindividuals who are not members of the Temple of Set can participate within arestricted framework in the OccultInstitute through the outer peristyle. This largely amounts to receiving the OITJournal, engaging within “public”OIT chat meetings and engaging in dialogue with the GM. This is in keeping witha long-running methodology thatOIT has had both as a Lodge, and then House within the Order of the Trapezoid.- 408 -Additionally OIT is also open for limited participation by Setians I° of theTemple of Set if the Setian meetscertain criteria [read the following statement]. There are no fees connectedwith OIT membership. We already havewhat we need.Affiliation with OIT requires that each individual have Internet email and webaccess. Additionally eachparticipant will have to obtain at least one software package for live chattingand lectures [it’s free], and to registerwith at least one specialized multi media oriented Bulletin Board Server [it’sprivate]. OIT also has its own readinglist; participants will need to obtain these books. Upon a request foraffiliation you will be informed specifically as towhat you will need.Setian I° Criteria for Statement of Interest1. Must be a member of a Pylon or the Soa Gild.2. State the specific empathy and affinity one has with OIT.3. Must submit at least one article or artwork for inclusion in the Scroll ofSet, the OIT Journal, and/orOIT website within one year of affiliation.4. Must have an Internet connection with private email and web access.5. Have the explicit permission of any III°+ Initiate you may be in regularcontact with to participatewithin OIT. You will be denied participation if your Priesthood contact feels itwill impede yourformative and initial work with the Temple of Set as a Setian I°.6. Only the Grand Master can revoke membership. However it is a given that if amember of thePriesthoods seeks revocation for a member it will be granted once the particularcircumstances havebeen determined. Revocation has no impact upon membership within the Temple ofSet, which will beconsidered as a separate issue by the Priesthood of Set.Note: Participation at the I° level within OIT is not full Order affiliation,which has its own set of magical andinitiatory requirements. I° participation amounts to a statement of interest inOIT, allows access to the secured OITwebsite, and places the Grand Master as an additional III°+ contact.Adept II° Criteria for OIT Affiliation1. Be an Adept II° in good standing.2. Must submit at least one article or artwork for inclusion in the Journaland/or OIT website within oneyear of affiliation.3. Must have an internet connection with private email and web access.4. Only the Grand Master can revoke membership.

Be a member of the Priesthood of Set in good standing.2. Must submit at least one article or artwork for inclusion in the Journaland/or OIT website within oneyear of affiliation.3. Must have an Internet connection with private email and web access.4. Only the Grand Master can revoke membership with consultation from the HighPriest and otherMasters of the Temple. Revocation has no impact upon membership within theTemple of Set.- 409 -The Action of Annunciation - Achieving OIT MasteryOIT does offer Recognition to the level of Master of OIT. Any II°+ Initiate ofthe Temple of Set who is also anOIT affiliate can seek the Path of Mastery after at least one year ofaffiliation. OIT does not presently offer Masterylevels of Recognition to OIT participants who are not members of the Temple ofSet, nor to Setian I° participants.Final WordsOIT has a large online archive of information at both its public website and itssecured private website (availableonly to Temple of Set OIT affiliates). Additionally we publish a largeelectronic magazine quarterly, entitled the OITJournal.OIT also has live chat, online lectures, and a very important reading list whosebooks affiliates will have toobtain. With this small bit said I send you greetings!- 410 -A74: The Order of Kronos- by William T. Butch IV°, Grand MasterOn the 18th of October XXXI (1996), The Order of Kronos came into being duringan Atlantean ancestralworking. Kronos, one of the mythological Atlantean Kings, sent forth hiswarrior/priest/ scientists, to the fourcorners of the Earth to create outposts among the barbaric tribes of that time.From those outposts came what wenow call civilization. The Order of Kronos is based upon the spirit of theseoutposts.The Order of Kronos will be composed of the three elements of its namesake. TheElement of the Warrior, theElement of Science, and the Element of the Mystic.Each element will have its own Master, with the expertise to conduct guidance inthat area. The Master of eachelement will be responsible to the Grand Master of the Order, who will createthe atmosphere in which meetings,workings, and seminars will take place. The Grand Master will work within allthree elements.Any Adept II° (+) may work within one, all, or any combination of elementswithin the Order. Some Setians maynot feel comfortable with aspects of one or another of the elements butnevertheless want to be a part of the whole.In keeping with the spirit of Kronos, a magical name is to be chosen by eachInitiate to further enhance the workof the Order through individualized effort.The Element of the Warrior will consist of the study of martial arts, edgedweapons, and the use of herbs forhealth and healing purposes. Those who participate in this element will beguardians of the Temple and will conductthemselves according to the traditions of chivalry and comradeship. This is anelement of heart, strength, andphysical well-being. Be advised that this element is the heart of the Order andis only for those Setians who wish towalk in the way of the ancient fighting spirit. A high sense of honor, truth,and courage are important factors andprerequisites for entrance into this element.The Element of Science will focus on the study of astronomy and the possibilityof other life-forms in theuniverse. Since the beginning of time we have been fascinated with the stars andwhat they may hold. This elementis one of creativity, imagination, and exploration of phenomena beyond our ownplanet.The Element of the Mystic addresses exploration of the ancient mysteries ofAtlantean mythology and the studyof supernatural phenomena. Results shall be used in workings of Greater BlackMagic. This is an element of darkshadows and unknown regions in which we come face-to-face with our fears, joy,power, and being.Those who wish to enter the world of Kronos may do so by written letter to theGrand Master. Include why youhave taken an interest in the Order, in what element you would like tospecialize, and what skills or knowledge, ifany, you would like to contribute to this element.- 411 -A75: The Order of Leviathan- by Bruce Ware IV°, Grand MasterThe Order of Leviathan is one of the oldest Orders of the Temple of Set, cominginto being in the year XVII ofthe Æon of Set (1982 CE), under the guidance and genius of the Order’s firstGrand Master, then-Magister JamesLewis. The Order was created to explore the messages of the “Statement ofLeviathan” as found in the Diaboliconand expanded through the years to the uncovering of the Æon-enhancing WordRemanifest, Uttered by then-Magus Lewis. Now, as then, its aims are to uncover the essential principles ofidentity, intelligence, and immortality.The Order of Leviathan operates as a magical vehicle for the Setian to explorethe Æonic Words Xeper andRemanifest. That is, we seek to answer the most fundamental and transcendentquestions of human existence,such as “What is the self that experiences Xeper?”What sort of Setian Initiate would pursue the quest in this fashion, rather thanchoosing another Order andmethod? The paths of initiation are as multivariate as the Initiates themselves.However a certain type of mentalityreads the open works of the Order and resonates with this mode of initiation.The OL offers a unique approach to Xeper: The Adept Black Magician explores andseeks to apprehend supra-rational concepts (and their supporting universal principles) of Being andBecoming that must be translated andapplied in a no-nonsense manner to the Objective Universe. It is this expressionof initiation in the ObjectiveUniverse that is contained in Remanifest: its relation to identity,intelligence, and immortality.Discovering universal principles through the dialectic process of the Socratic/Platonic “pyramid of thought” -dianoia and nœsis (“learning” and “knowing”) - is the basic core of the Order ofLeviathan’s approach to initiation.This approach is an overtly intellectual orientation through which the Setianmind obtains wisdom andunderstanding to achieve the ultimate expression of the Gift of Set -Setamorphosis.Thus the Order of Leviathan holds that the Word Remanifestation is critical tothe accomplishment of theÆonic Formula: Xepera Xeper Xeperu. That is, without Remanifestation, the ideaof Becoming is an abstraction -one without the necessary context of demonstrating to the Objective Universe theessential fact that Xeper hasoccurred, that “something” in the initiating being has changed.We Remanifest the sense of Self that is the core identity. We Remanifest thepower of our essential humanitythrough the expression of the Gift of Set - the capacity or potential calledintelligence that humans alone possess.We Remanifest the development of the personal will that leads to the possibilityof surviving death as an integratedand unique individual consciousness - what we know as immortality.Some of the current goals and interests being explored in the Order are brieflysummarized in the following list:• What is the essential Self, and how does it differ from the everydaypersonality?• By what act of will can we achieve identity with (i.e. recognize) thisessential Self?• How can we enhance and increase the capabilities inherent in intelligence -the singular Gift of the BlackFlame by which our forebears became human?• How may we further exalt the Black Flame of Set?Through this approach, and because of our use of the inspired texts, the Orderof Leviathan presents itself as theexplicitly religious core of the Temple of Set, uniting a rigorous applicationof reason with a willed assent to the ideaof an objective end for which humans were designed, a purpose underlying thebestowal of the Gift by Set, atranscendent destiny for Setians as the agents of the Black Flame.- 412 -A76: The Order of Merlin- by David Austen IV°, Grand MasterMerlin in ContextThe figure and character of Merlin conjures up visions of the flag-bedeckedtowers of Camelot, King Arthur andthe Knights of the Round Table, battles with dragons and giants, as well aswondrous magical feats: all the “stuff” oflegend.The Hollywood glamour machine has given the character of Merlin some startreatment. Two notablecharacterizations stand out: Nicol Williamson as Merlin in John Boorman’srendering to film of Excalibur (from SirThomas Mallory’s book Morte d’Arthur published in 1485), and Edward Woodward’squite exceptional portrayal ofthe magician for a low-budget TV movie.Sometime between 14 and 50 CE the Romans invaded the Druid stronghold on (whatis now known as) the Isleof Anglesey. In an effort to break Celtic British resistance to the Romanannexation of the island, the legionariesexterminated the cult leaders, razed the sacred groves, and at a stroke wipedout the whole belief system.Presumably a few “Druids” managed to escape the carnage and took refuge in theremaining Gælic enclaves in theareas that we now call Wales, Scotland, and the West Country. It is in theseareas that the Merlinic myths haveendured.The popular figure of Merlin comes to us from one main source, the Vita Merlini,a biography of Merlin thatcontains a complete magical system. Much of the material derives from Celtic andclassical traditions, particularlythe Mabinogion, an ancient Welsh epic poem. Secondary sources are The PropheticVision of Merlin, which itself isderived from yet another source, The History of the Kings of England (both weretranscribed by Geoffrey ofMonmouth between 1140-1160 CE). The latter work deals at some length with theearly life of Merlin as well as theGlastonbury Legend, which alludes to a visit by Jesus of Nazareth in his youthwith Joseph of Arimathea, andJoseph’s later return to Glastonbury with the “Holy Graal”. Thirty years afterthe first transcription an addition wasmade to the work to accommodate the transition of human remains - claimed to bethose of Arthur and Guinevere -to the nave of Glastonbury Abbey in 1190.However Geoffrey of Monmouth’s material is not intended to be biographical inthe modern understanding ofthe word. It does not seem to have been the author’s intention to render thematerial as anything other than a loosecollection of tales, poems, and images woven around the central character ofMerlin. This included imagery, magic,and psychic insights that are undeniably ancient. These may be assumed to bedrawn from oral tradition retainingthe wisdom, songs, and poems of the old Celtic/Druidic cultures, preserved bybards and travelling storytellers.Geoffrey of Monmouth and his contemporary Gerald of Wales recorded these talesfor posterity.The character of Merlin is composed of two component parts: Merlin Calidoniusand Merlin Ambrosius. MerlinCalidonius appears to be what we could interpret to be “Merlin of the WildWood”, viz. the Shamanistic Merlin.Merlin Ambrosius would seem to be compatible with Merlin’s intellectual aspects.Merlin’s name has connotations for the present Æon, for the literal meaning ofthe Gælic rendering of Merlin isMyrddin (old Welsh), meaning “Hawk”.The legends and myths of Merlin touch upon deep-seated yearnings within thepsyche of all magicians, and areas relevant at the dawn of the second millennium CE as they were to ourancestors.The Order of Merlin will not be a flag-waving exercise for British basedSetians. The underlying Principles of theMerlinic myth are universal, and as with all Temple Orders Merlin will make theresults of its workings and magicalprojects available to the Temple through the Ruby Tablet and the Scroll of Set,as well as through the pages of theOrder’s newsletter, The Draconian Tablet.Magical PathsUnder Merlin’s cloak the Order is able to pursue and entertain a wide field ofmagical workings, drawn from arich body of lore.Merlin permeates most Western magical traditions, Aleister Crowley being noexception; thus we have a widefield to explore. We have in Merlin the exemplification of shamanism which,through the many ages of humandevelopment, has been prevalent at one time or another in most cultures.In Arthur’s early days as King, Merlin transforms the sovereign into a varietyof animals. This enabled Arthur toappreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the various creatures and to obtain aview of life from their perspective.Shape-shifting has been used by warriors through the ages, from the NativeAmericans to the Leopard Men ofKenya, as a means of obtaining strength in battle.In the name of Arthur we have Arth gwyr (Brythonic), the Roman “Gens” name ofArtorius (coming from theLatin artos viros) meaning “Bear Man”, or a combination of the Brythonic andLatin words for bear, Arth andUrsus. This would be in keeping with the traditions of many cultures to define awarrior’s ability and his guardianspirit. Examples from the Native American culture are Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse,Grey Wolf, etc.- 413 -Wolves were particularly abundant in Europe until the eighteenth century.Werewolf legends are probablyremnants of the shape shifting rituals of our ancestors.Such magic enables the magician to perceive the transformations and expressionsof the self as it undergoesmetamorphosis, also to perceive that absolute core self which remains the samein Essence as it Remanifests.The shaman is also at one with the environment, and the scope for gleaning themagical knowledge in these areboundless. Subjects like herbs, plants, even the practice of sweat lodges areall fertile grounds for research.The legends of Merlin occupy a position close to the core of Western magic. Thistradition involves innertransformation and growth through radical changes in one’s modes ofconsciousness. The Vita Merlini revealsMerlin’s life as an exemplary magical pattern, demonstrating both masculine andfeminine powers. The Order ofMerlin exists to facilitate an integration of all aspects of the psyche,including the generally repressed “minority” or“demonic” Self. The Merlinic magician possesses mastery of his/her completeSelf.Merlin also offers an additional perspective into the magical practices of Dr.John Dee and Edward Kelly. Manyof the “Enochian Visions” were induced using the Druidic practice of scrying,employing either water or mirrors,crystals, and “shew stones”. Dr. Dee’s scrying mirror, on show for many years inthe Renaissance Gallery of theBritish Museum, was an obsidian mirror taken from an Aztec Temple. The Aztecritual of the “Smoking Mirror” wasanother form of scrying, and Dee’s mirror had been used for that purpose by theAztec Priests.Merlin does not die, according to the Vita, but rather moves into a state ofbeing best explained by Xeper andRemanifestation. The legend of Merlin is yet another example of a magicaltradition truly international in scope. Thelore surrounding this figure is rich and stimulating; Merlin is not just anobscure figure of legend and history, but avery real force to be embraced.Of Many TonguesOne of the saddest indictments of our so called modern and enlightened age isthat it has allowed so much ofour heritage to slip through its grasp.For the most part very few of us on this planet are aware of our culture or ourheritage, part of which being ournative languages.Some of the languages are lost forever with no surviving link (e.g. we knowroughly how ancient Egyptiansounded from its surviving counterpart). The sounds and languages of the Vikingsand Anglo Saxons have beenrestored, since some semblance of their language survives today and can bereconstructed from manuscripts, etc.Who would not thrill to hear Beowulf spoken in the original Anglo/Germaniclanguage in which it was originallycreated?However the sub-dialects of the main languages have passed from us only in thelast hundred years. Manx (abranch of the North Celtic language), native to the Isle of Man, saw the lastpolyglot speaker die in 1955. Fortunatelythe language was recorded by linguists and has enjoyed a small renaissance.Cornish (a Southern Celtic branchlanguage) was declared extinct in 1800, but again the language has beenrestored, thanks to records. However theneighbouring Devonshire Gælic was extinct by 1820 and entirely lost to us.Breton, Flemish, Welsh, Irish, andScottish Gælic survive and are spoken quite widely in their various countries,with their own unique and poeticcharacteristics.Part of the work of the Order of Merlin will be the encouragement of its membersto engage in the study of anative language. The Order will then record and preserve those languages forposterity and for future Setians. Intranslating the ancient magical records into English or another major language,so much of the original meaning canbe lost. However viewed and read in the language it was originally written incan in itself be an experienceunrivalled.AffiliationThe Order of Merlin welcomes correspondence from all Initiates. However formalmembership of the Order isreserved to Adepts II° and the Priesthood of Set III°. The Order’s work will bemade available to the Masters of theTemple, as well as to members of the Priesthood and to Pylon Sentinels if theyso request it. Much of the materialwill be copied to the Ruby Tablet of Set.The newsletter/magazine for the Order is the Draconian Tablet, the titlereflecting Merlin’s close associationwith “the Dragon”, identifying with the natural forces of the earth (in Europeanand Far Eastern magic). Thispublication will be available worldwide (in English), primarily free to Ordermembers and to Initiates of thePriesthood of Set who request it. It will also be posted to Glinda.The Grand Masters will expect a commitment from all OM members to work togetherin their geographicalareas, independent of their Pylon activities, and to explore Merlin’s magicalpath in a spirit of unity, accord, anddignity that befits the most honourable title of Setian.Xeper and Remanifest. Ab uno disce omnes. (From one example learn about all).- 414 -A77: The Order of Nepthys- by Lilith Aquino IV°, Grand MasterThe Order of Nepthys will approach magic as a “total environment”, withattention to outward, physicalappearance holding as important a place as the inner self of the Initiate. Basicprinciples, for example, will includetechniques of attire, grooming, and cosmetics designed to bring out theindividual's most striking physicalattributes. Simultaneous emphasis will be accorded aspects of personality,being, and will. The synthesis of mentaland physical development will be the manifestation of a total being. Only such abeing can expect success in magic,as the entire spectrum of individual qualities is called upon for Lesser andGreater Workings.Initiates will be expected to learn to handle various situations relative to theprofane public, to include lecturingand interviewing. Not every Initiate will engage in such activities regularly,but all must have the skills and self-confidence to do so. The Order of Nepthys accepts both male and femaleInitiates.Admission to the Order of Nepthys requires Recognition to the degree of AdeptII° as a prerequisite. Newmembers of the Order will not immediately be exposed to advanced applications ofthe Greater Black Magical(GBM) theories or philosophies of the Black Arts pertinent to the Order. Theirfirst concern will be rather withLesser Black Magic (LBM): what it is and how they may use it to their advantage.They will approach the concept ofthe “true self” and its magical development according to the Word Thelema.Members of the Order will then further refine their basic magical skills whilebeing introduced to the principlesof the Word Indulgence. This will enable them to perfect their mastery of LBMand to gain initial skill in GBM. Atthis stage in their development, they will learn the significance of the BlackFlame and will undergo instruction inthe high art of Black Magic. Such instruction will be under the personalguidance of the Grand Master of the Order.Only when the Grand Master is satisfied that the Initiate is cognizant of andcompetent in the techniques of this Artshould the Initiate apply them independently.Initiates of the Priesthood III° will work with the Grand Master on advancedapplications of the Black Arts.They will be exposed to the concepts of the Abyss and of the magical Formulæoutlining the Great Work of theÆons. Workings at this level will again be on an individual basis, as determinedby the individual characteristics ofeach Priest or Priestess. At this point the rationale for a magical name will beexplored and applied where and ifappropriate. Guidance to and cooperation with II° Initiates of the Order will bea part of III° responsibilities, withgreater time and attention being accorded those who make greater efforts tolearn from the Order.Nepthys, the Consort of Set, was goddess of darkness, the night sky, and theinvisible in ancient Egypt. Hername (aka “Nephthys”) means “Mistress [or Lady] of the Temple”, and sherepresented “things which are yet tocome into being” (the future) in contrast to her sister Isis (who represented“things which are”). Nepthys sharedwith Set the title of “Mighty One of Words of Power”.- 415 -A78: The Order of Nietzsche- by Roland Winkhart IV°, Grand MasterA premise of the Temple of Set is that the psychecentric consciousness canevolve towards its owndivinity through deliberate exercise of the consciousness and will, a process ofBecoming or Coming IntoBeing whose roots may be found in the dialectic method expounded by Plato andthe conscious exaltationof the Will proposed by Nietzsche. - M. Aquino VI°Friedrich Nietzsche was born near Leipzig in 1844, the son of a Lutheranclergyman. He attended the famousPforta School, then went to university at Bonn and Leipzig, where he studiedphilology (the study of literature andrelated fields) and read Schopenhauer. When he was only 24 he was appointed tothe chair of classical philology atBasel University; he remained there until retiring for reasons of health in1879.While at Basel he made and broke his friendship with Wagner, participated in theFranco-Prussian War as anambulance orderly, and published The Birth of Tragedy (1872), UntimelyMeditations (1873-6), and the first twoparts of Human, All Too Human (1878-9). From 1880 until his final collapse in1889, he divorced himself fromeveryday life except for brief interviews. Supported by his university pension,he lived mainly in France, Italy, andSwitzerland. The third part of Human, All Too Human appeared in 1880, followedby Dawn in 1881. Also SprachZarathustra was written between 1883 and 1885, and his last completed book wasthe autobiography Ecce Homo.He became insane in 1889 and remained in a condition of mental and physicalparalysis until his death in 1900.Much of human history can be explained, if not excused by the conflict betweenthose of low intelligence(who consider good/evil objective) and those of high intelligence (who considergood/evil subjective).Certainly it begs the question to use these very terms to distinguish oneextreme from the other ... TheTemple of Set seeks freedom by attempting to escape those norms - andpreexisting ones - and to encourageits Initiates to construct enlightened, individualistic definitions. This is asmuch an art as a science, and thequest must be undertaken and pursued with logic, caution, common sense ... andthe apprehension of theAgathon. - M. Aquino VI°Nietzsche is perhaps best known for his strident materialism - “God is dead!” -and his concept of theÜbermensch (superman). Only those who have taken the time to study Nietzsche’sworks carefully know the exactmeaning and context of such terms. All too often Nietzsche’s ideas are confusedwith the xenophobic propaganda ofNational Socialism, with which it actually has very little in common.Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch, forexample, was intellectually rather than racially based.Nietzsche approached such ideas as the Übermensch and the “Will to Power” inAlso Sprach Zarathustra. Forinstance:When I went to men for the first time, I committed the folly of hermits, thegreat folly: I set myself inthe marketplace. And when I spoke to everyone, I spoke to no one. In theevening, however, tight-ropewalkers and corpses were my companions; and I myself was almost a corpse. Withthe new morning cameunderstanding; I learned to say, “What are the marketplace, the mob, and themob’s confusion to me?”You higher man, learn this from me: In the marketplace no one believes in highermen. And if you wantto speak there, very well, do so! But the masses will blink and say, “We are allequal There are no highermen; man is but man, and before God we are all equal.”Higher men, this God was your greatest danger, but now this God is dead. Do notaccept equality withthe masses; depart from the marketplace!Do you understood, O my brothers? Are you terrified? Do your hearts fail? Doesthe abyss yawn beforeyou? Does the very hound of Hell bay at you? So be it! God is dead; now wedesire that the superman shalllive.Within this exhortation to the superman is a warning: Even when the massesappear to praise creative intellects,such admiration may be fickle and treacherous because the masses sense that suchintellects are capable of exposingand exploding mundane, traditional values based on popular falsehoods. Themasses’ only enduring loyalty belongsto demagogues who play to mob sentiment rather than to the great truths. “Eineneue Gattung von Philosophenkommt hervor ... diese Philosophen der Zukunft möchten ein Recht, vielleichtauch ein Unrecht darauf haben, alsVersucher bezeichnet zu werden. (A new type of philosopher is emerging ... Thesephilosophers of the future take tothemselves, even if imprecisely, the role of tempters.)”Thus the Nietzschean superman functions as a Black Magician. “Alle Menschen, aufdie bisher etwas ankam,waren böse. (All men who have been of real value have been evil.)” But this isnot the evil of wanton cruelty orsadism - rather a casting-aside of idols that, while reassuring to the masses,have served to stifle the evolution of thesoul.- 416 -As is demonstrated by Zarathustra, Nietzsche was not so much a designer ofutopian social/political systems asa proposer of capabilities and attitudes for intelligent individuals. Hiswritings are frequently allegorical, demandingconscious effort on the part of the reader to comprehend the underlyingprinciples.Nietzsche intended that the principles in his writings be applied, not merelyintellectually appreciated. Thusphilosophy is akin to the physical sciences and indeed to the basic tasks oflife; they all involve “attitudes ofbecoming (Lebenshaltung)”. “Alle die Wahrheiten sind für mich blutigeWahrheiten. (All truths are for me bloodyones.)”The Order of Nietzsche will study this great Satanic Master’s philosophy fromthe Setian perspective - theapplicability to our personal Xeper. And Nietzsche was not only a great thinkerbut a man of refreshing and subtlehumor. In one of his posthumously-published notebooks - called “black diamonds”- he wrote: “Mit den Fürsten derFinsternis habe ich Würfel gespielt. (With the Princes of Darkness I havegambled at dice.)”- 417 -A79: The Order of Sebekhet- by Patty A. Hardy IV°, Grand MasterDo not bend your knee nor drop your eye, for such things were not done in myhouse at PaMat-et. Butspeak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier.- The Book of Coming Forth by NightInspired by the stellar gaze of the Setian pharaohs, the Order of Sebekhet looksto the night sky and itshistorical, philosophic, and initiatory impact on the origin, development, andfuture of the psyche.The intent of this work is the personal and self-directed transformation of theInitiate on the path topsychecentric divinity. The method is Polarian, involving an oscillation betweenthe poles of reason and creativeintuition.The Order’s work can be described in terms of several goals:•Exploration of a specific perspective on the symbolism of the Left-Hand Path.•Pursuit of the immortality of the psyche.•Use of the night sky as a source of continuing energy and inspiration.•Creating times and places into which the psyche may Remanifest.The Order explores various methods of-approaching these goals:•Examining the origins of human orderings of space and time.•Learning to consciously order the spatial and temporal structure of one’sexperience.•Uncovering the true impact of cosmic phenomena on terrestrial systems andevents.•Equipping and experiencing the self as a creator of universes.Origins and DestinyThe arts and sciences of interest to the Order of Sebekhet have enabled certainindividuals to traverse deserts,seas, and other liminal regions, crossing both cultural/subjective andmaterial/objective boundaries to bring freshknowledge and possibilities to the world. This knowledge ultimately unlocks agate to passage of a transhumanintelligence across fathomless depths of space and time.The survival of star maps in the tombs of the Setian pharaohs attests to theantiquity and authenticity of thisknowledge. Moreover the association of the ancient cult of Set with the desertoases and caravan towns is welldocumented, as is the identification of Set with the circumpolar stars.It is the traveler who has the practical interest in circumpolar stars. In thissimple fact one may glimpse thepurpose of Set in reconsecrating a Temple of Set on Earth at this time.Theory and PracticeThe Order of Sebekhet examines all facets of the relationship between the psycheand the night sky. One beginsby experiencing the night sky directly and becoming familiar with it.Experiencing the night sky is best done by leaving populated areas, which havesubstantial light pollution, andgoing to wild or empty open areas on a clear night. It is not necessary to own atelescope. It is necessary to pick up avocabulary for what is seen.Learn the meaning of these terms: ecliptic, precession, zodiac, equinox,solstice, circumpolar, helical. Some ofthese are connected with the very origin of the modern Temple of Set, beingfound in the Book of Coming Forth byNight and in the commentary on that Working text. Understanding these terms -and relating them to what is seenof the night sky - will also unlock “secrets” of several other esoterictraditions.Setians who have previously paid no attention to the night sky may find thatthis experience evokes thoughts,insights and impulses of initiatory significance without the artificial “jumpstart” of ritual. There are reasons for thisthat become evident with repeated exposure, intellectual study, andphilosophical introspection. It is suggested thatthe Initiate keep a journal or some other record of these impressions.Once the student has mastered the basics, personal work becomes a springboardinto the unknown within andbeyond. Here are a few of the topics that fall within the Order’s scope:- 418 -The Objectification of ExperienceMeasurement is, in its broadest sense, the objectification of subjectiveexperience. The Initiate of Sebekhetexamines historical, political, anthropological, archæological, and sociologicalaspects of measurement as well asphilosophical theories on the structure and experience of space and time.Sciences & Technologies of OrientationHaving established measures of space and time, the isolate intelligence usesthese tools to structure itsrelationship to the natural order. Cartography, calendars and timekeeping,celestial navigation, and the biology andphysiology of orientation fall under this heading.The Celestial Context of the SelfThe isolate intelligence, having created subjective tools to explore and workwith the natural order, then turnsthem to investigation of this self-created order, its limits, and itssignificance. What is the relationship of its creativepower to the natural order? Study of historical schools and doctrines addressedto this question is part of the workof the Order.Examples of such schools and doctrines include the star cults of paganantiquity, astronomical elements ofChristianity and Islam, Gnostic cosmology, and Renaissance astrological ideas,astral motifs, and themes inThelemic texts, and modem stellar mythology such as UFO contactee cults. Thisstudy, aside from its instructive andinspirational side, provides the Initiate with building blocks for definition ofthe self order in relation to the worldorder.StructureAdmissionTo be considered for affiliation with the Order of Sebekhet, open a dialoguewith the Master of the Order.Successful candidates will have•An explanation of what interests them about the Order of Sebekhet, and what theyhope to accomplishthrough affiliation.•A specific question they want to explore.•Plans for how their findings will be communicated or demonstrated.PublicationsThe Order of Sebekhet occasionally publishes an internal journal, M101.Organizational StructureThe Order of Sebekhet has an outer and an inner peristyle.All Setians who affiliate with the Order belong to the outer peristyle. Accessto the inner peristyle is open toaffiliated Setians who illustrate both theoretical and practical mastery of theOrder’s methods through publicteaching and external publication.Suggested ReadingDavidson, Norman.

Robinson IV°, Grand MasterEssent into EssenceLove is the Essence, Love within DeathThe Order of the Sepulcher of the Obsidian Masque (OSOM) perceives Set as anindwelling and essentialcomponent of the human psyche which is representative of man’s potential forphysical, intellectual, and spiritualdevelopment. Consequently Set serves as a meta-model for transformation andchange that is the result of a soul-wrenching refusal to accept a status quo morality based on an antiquated set ofartificially-imposed standards thathave ceased to serve, but instead now imprison the evolving human mind.Thinking of Set in these terms - as an indwelling energy source which can beactivated through magicalinitiation. and as a model for change - is the first step in understanding thepurpose and function of this Temple ofSet Order. Furthermore Setians wishing to explore the Temple of Set via the OSOMgenerally come to thisrealization for themselves prior to requesting membership.The next step, and a crucial one, is the realization that the Order of theSepulcher of the Obsidian Masque (theopposite of the sepulcher as a place of death) is designed to help develop a“state of being” in which the reality ofdeath is confronted through intense ritual processes and meditations1 designedto introduce a Setian to a richer andmore profound sensitivity for life.This practice is fundamental to many of the ancient mystery schools (Egypt,Tibet, the Mayans, etc.) in which“secret” knowledge was promised to those who dared confront the darkest and mostfrightening event in life - death.The Wewelsburg Working, performed by Dr. Michael Aquino, then-High Priest ofSet, is a perfect example ofdonning death’s most horrible but fascinating mask in order to gain deeperlife-affirming insight. OSOM proposesthat only through this kind of confrontational exploration of death can a trueand lasting awareness of the mysteriesof life, death, and continuation come into being.The Sepulcher of the Obsidian Masque is a metaphor for the usually dormant,under-utilized, and largelyunexplored arena of possibility and potency that lies sleeping within. Theignorant should beware, however, for the“Essence” can awaken!After a rather long period of reflection on such terms as “crypt”, “tomb”,“grave”, “holy place”, “sarcophagus”,“vault”, etc., I chose the word “sepulcher” as the one best able to describe theSokarian exploration of life through anexperiential comprehension of death. One appealing aspect of this word is that,as an expression for a place ofinterment, “sepulcher” is rarely used today except in gothic horror-stories whenan eerie effect is desired. Its useavoids the movie and novel cliches which are immediately evoked when words like“crypt” and “tomb” come intoplay.Even as a place of interment a sepulcher is different from other suchplaces dedicated to the memory of thedead. Instead of being built up with stones, bricks, or concrete, or dug intothe ground, a sepulcher is carved out ofliving rock. It is a sacred place of lasting grandeur that is used but once andsealed for eternity. As an adjective theword is used in describing the rituals and ceremonies of death and renewal(sepulchral rites), and in reference to thedeep, mysterious, and resonant voice that appears to originate within its depths(a sepulchral voice). Both conceptshave importance in the Order of the Sepulcher of the Obsidian Masque.ObsidianObsidian (pure black obsidian, fire obsidian, and rainbow obsidian seem to bethe most appropriate as far asOSOM is concerned) is the material out of which the masque (symbolic of theneutral, unformed self at the centerof being - essence) is cut. Obsidian is a dark, usually black (or mostly black),hard and strong vitreous (glass-like)lava. Today it is a popular gemstone, but in the past many cultures used it inthe construction of knives, spear- andarrow-heads, as well as sacred ritual tools, jewelry, and mirrors.2 Blackobsidian is the fire-born, fire-hardenedsubstance of the Abyss which must be crossed before true self-realization ispossible. It is the Black Flame of Setwhich burns darkly bright within the heart of every Setian magician.As far as black obsidian is concerned, it is easy to agree with some “New Age”statements describing this stone’spower as a “master teacher” and a “warrior of truth”. As such it is important torealize that black obsidian does notcater to the egotistical whims of any self-deceiving individual.Setians know better than most the power of the darkness that is so elegantlysymbolized by this powerfulvolcanic stone. In her book Crystal Enlightenment Katrina Raphael goes evenfurther [the brackets are added by mefor reasons that would be obvious if the reader had the original text in hand]:It [black obsidian] bluntly and often tactlessly shows the ego-self where it isat and what it needs tochange in order to advance to the next step of evolutionary growth. It acts as amirror that reflects the flaws- 421 -in one’s nature, and magnifies the fears, insecurities and egocentric attitudesthat suppress the soul’ssuperior qualities.Black obsidian could be named “the warrior of truth”, that which slays theillusion to give birth to thevision of [the AEon of Set]. In this new [aeon] each person will live inaccordance to the dictates of his ownhigher consciousness, and that unified consciousness will form the foundationand be the commondenominator that links each person to [a shared] truth.The black obsidian consciousness interprets all experiences and occurrences froma neutral, clearperspective. The mastery is in the ability to constantly identify with the truththat is inherent but oftenhidden in the illusion, in every facet of life.Masque and MaskAs far as the word “masque” is concerned, I chose the French spelling over theEnglish “mask” for severalreasons. Besides containing all the variety of meaning that is in “mask”, the“masque” plays an important role in thehistory of presentational theater (different from dramatic literature).In England and France during the 15th and 16th centuries, the masque was a verypopular, semi-dramatictheatrical production which involved music, dance, mime, verse, and spectacle.It was written, designed, directed,and performed by royal amateurs for their own entertainment. The popularity ofthis form later gave rise toprofessional theater as we know it today.The performers of masques wore masks to protect their identity and permit them acertain freedom ofexpression which family and position would not normally allow.Masks (which can be simply defined as intuitively- or artistically-designedfacial coverings) are part of anancient tradition, which OSOM wishes to identify with and tap into. They havebeen a primary form of symbolismand abstraction since the very beginning of mankind’s search for, andexploration of its own humanity.Masks are symbolic in form and construction, and they become symbols ofsometimes enormouspotency and authority in themselves. Ceremony and ritual, fetish and taboo,totem, superstition, and magichave been the messages of masks from primitive cultures down to our own - weassume more sophisticated -culture. From the animal and spirit masks of ancient Egypt to the present, thesesculpted face coveringshave demonstrated the deepest fantasies of the artist in man and continue toevoke nebulous sensations ofthe unknown and the supernatural.3For the purposes of OSOM, “Masque” will be capitalized and used only whenreferring to the Order and theObsidian Masque itself, which reflects the total potential for fruition at thecenter of the Setian magician.When referring to the various manifestations of Xeper which can be representedby “masks” of various types,styles, and materials, the word “mask” is appropriate. The phrase “masks of themagician”, for example, refers to thevarious magical personalities, functions and roles the magician plays withinreality as he or she perceives it.Masks have and will continue to serve as important tools in the Dromenicexploration of Essence, as well as inthe various ways the Setian magician manifests on this plane of existence.Back to the OrderPrior to manifestation the Obsidian Masque (Essence) is pure and formless,neutral and without expression, asit lies in silent potency at the center of being. The largely internal processof initiation shapes this formlessness andneutrality into a cast of features which best express the characteristics,attitudes, feeling states, and symbologiesrelative to a specific phase of magical development.Each stage of Xeper, the process through which Essence (the higher self in allits potency) is explored andultimately realized, is represented by its own, ultra-specific mask. Each Setianmask (the vampyre, the serpent, themagician, the mythological Set, the archetype of Satan, death, Anubis, the neterof a magical name, etc.) is areflection of the magician’s degree of initiation at any given time, within anyspecific area of exploration, during theongoing and ever changing process of Xeper.Initiation can be thought of as a blend of intellectual and intuitive learningprocesses. Each Setian’s learning/initiatory process differs to a greater or lesser degree from others, becauseeach Setian is a complex mix of right- andleft-brained responses to stimuli originating somewhere within the perceivedreality of the individual Setian (theSetian’s “subjective universe”). The decisions made and actions taken inresponse to such stimuli are the buildingblocks of who we are - self-initiating magicians. Consequently it is expectedthat the manifesting form of Setianexpression (prose, poetry, music, art, etc.) should vary greatly from Initiateto Initiate.Many Setians undertake a search and exploration of their reality on anintellectual level and best express theirinsights in some prose format. For other Setians their internal explorationsresult in poetry, music, and variousforms of illustrative artwork. Most Setians achieve a certain amount of balanceand harmony in their magical workas well as in their mode of expression, mixing both left- and right-brainedexplorations of the self and expressing theresults in terms both the intellect and the emotions can comprehend.- 422 -These modes of expression have one thing in common, however; they do not requirethat the producing Setian,the one with whom the expression originated and whose inner journey is shared,be present in order to beunderstand by other Setians.There still remains a group of Setians for whom an important mode of expressionis their physical being (actors,dancers, storytellers, mimes, singers, orators, musicians, martial artists,stage magicians, etc. ). Such expressiondemands the physical presence of both the presenting magician, as well as othermagicians in the form of anaudience. Only through physical expression can this type of Setian’s message befully and appropriately conveyed.Such performance- or presentation-oriented magicians are also fully capable ofexpressing themselves throughother modes of communication, but there remains a very expressive and deeplymagical aspect of the self which canonly be shared through movement and/or voice. A Dromen(a) of the Sepulcher (amember of the OSOM) is thekind of magician for whom a physio-dramatic expression of magic is of paramountimportance.Dromen(a) of the Sepulcher and the DromenonTo many it may seem that the primary interest of the OSOM is the planning andperformance of Dromenon orPsychosomatic/Ritual Theater Productions. One probable reason for thismisconception was the original decision ofthe Grand Master to designate members of the OSOM as “Actors of the Sepulcher”.The reason for doing this wasnot to emphasize the importance of performance as much as to stress theimportant roles that actors havetraditionally played in the societies in which they have lived. They have beenseen as the guardians of intuitivewisdom, as seers and shamans, and as creators of visions with the power toassist others in experiencing magicalrealities that might not otherwise have been possible.In contemporary use, however, the term “actor” is often used to designate onewho “plays” roles for money,“acts” out scenes for entertainment, or presents a “persona” which has nothingwhatsoever to do with “truth” or theexpression of a truth. Because of this perception and the ease with which theword “actor” can be misinterpreted, itwas decided that a name-change was in order.A search was undertaken for a term that would express the multifaceted nature ofthe Setians who might wantto join the Order, but even more importantly an expression was needed whichcould encapsulate the pursuit of thatknowledge which results from an intense experiential awareness of realbiological death. Research finally led to abook by Joseph L. Henderson, The Wisdom of the Serpent, in which the appropriateword was found:Symbolically man enters the underworld, he “dies” in a dromenon ... and he isalways symbolicallyreborn ... The uninitiated and hence inconsecrate remains “in death”... Only hewho in a dromenon, thesacral mime, becomes “blessed” (moves into the realm of the initiated) ...(this) true initiate [the Dromen] isone who by the very nature of his psychic unrest or suffering needs a period ofcontainment during which hecan be healed [the period of initiation].The Dromen or Dromena (feminine), the Initiate who accepts the sacred role ofActor/Mime by joining theOrder of the Sepulcher of the Obsidian Masque, must not only experience anindividual dromenon but must sharethat experience with others via a Dromenon created and performed by them. Andevery such Initiate must also beconvinced beyond doubt of the individual and unique nature of the Dromenon (aritual theater exploration)experienced. Still, no matter how profoundly one has been affected by it,experiences of this sort must beperiodically re-experienced because, as Henderson writes:The coherence of the initiation archetype is broken up or distorted by manyother problems pressing infrom the personal affairs of everyday life and the claims of that verycollective world in which we necessarilymust live. During the initiatory experience of the dromenon, dream symbols areimpregnated with personalassociations so closely interwoven with the archetypal images that it may takemany months to unravel thetwo meanings of the same symbol, one belonging to the personal ego and the otherto the impersonal [theEssence].But fortunately the symbolism of initiation itself usually comes to the rescuewith a new symboliccontent of such universality as to redeem the individual from auto-eroticisolation and lift his/herexperience to another level of meaning where ego and self, personal andimpersonal (mundane andessential) again may come together in a spirit of cooperation.A Dromenon is an ideal way to encounter death in a controlled and positiveenvironment. The lasting impact ofthis experience can be just as great as the “real thing” without the negativeconnotations. In simple terms the OSOMDromenon manifests the process of initiation that can occur through a symbolicdeath/life initiatory experience.Because of this experience it can be said that a Dromen(a) has one foot in thisreality and the other in a verydifferent reality of his/her own choice and creation. Subsequently Initiates whoactively and willingly undergo sucha process [as members of OSOM] are designated a Dromen(a) of the Sepulcher (DS),that which is signified bythe Bind Rune (Dag-Ken-Tyr), and is thus commended to all Initiates of theLeft-Hand Path as one who has beentouched and changed by the fire of death and ennobled with the understandingthat death is but a state of transition- 423 -and essential metamorphosis. This entire exploration is referred to by the GrandMaster of the Order as “Essentinto Essence”.Essent into EssenceAs the Black Magician continues the strange and sometimes fitful journey alongthe Left Hand Path, he or sheeventually - usually sooner rather than later - comes to the point where thePlatonic question is asked: “Whatconstitutes a full and complete life?”For the Setian who wishes to join the OSOM and become a Dromen(a) the nextquestion should be: “Is itpossible to live such a life without taking into consideration the role thatdeath plays in life?”Such a person, in order to provide life with the qualitative value it requires,sees no alternative but to take deathinto consideration and, without equivocation, incorporate it into the living oflife. So total should this commitmentbe that the ultimate incorporation of the death metaphor into life is no longera question of “Do I?” or “Don’t I?” but“How should it be done?”.The truth resulting from this exploration is measured by the degree to which itfacilitates the individual processof Setian self-initiation. If insight can be sparked and result in a widervision of what is, and evoke a deeper inquiryinto what can be, this process (Essent into Essence) can be of immeasurable andlasting value.By now it should be evident that the OSOM sees but one “true” way to gaincertain knowledge of one’s Essence:through an intense and dedicated exploration of existence. Living life, in allits tragi-comedy uniqueness, is the onlymeans to this end. To know Essence one must not only passionately seek and livelife to the fullest [which takesplace through the willed application of the AEonic concepts of Xeper andRemanifestation], but must also becomeinvolved in an in-depth examination of death and the role it plays as aninherent part of life. This experientialjourney into Essence through an exploration of death is called Essent - Essentinto Essence.As indicated at the beginning of this statement, the OSOM sees Set as anindwelling Essence (of isolate, un-natural origin) which is activated through the process of self-initiation.Examining this idea through the lens ofEssent into Essence, it becomes clear that Essence and Set are one and the same,and that Essent is theinitiatory death which precedes an awareness of self that is thought of asSet-consciousness.This realization can be likened in its intensity to the Satori stateoccasionally experienced by Zen practitioners.The major difference, however, is that the experience of Set-consciousness isnot one of losing the self by becominga part of a greater cosmic whole, but is an experience of Becoming one with thehighest, most essential self - Set.Love is the Essence - Love Within DeathThe Left-Hand-Path/Setian experience of “love” in its purest form is Platonic innature, and is defined as “thedesire to comprehend a thing in all its thingness or to know a thing as it isand not as the perceiver wishes it to be”.The Set-XIV Conclave experience made it clear to the GM that an exploration ofSetian (Platonic) love is anecessary part of the Essent into Essence, and begins with the desire tocomprehend and “love” the self in all itsselfness. This “love” can obviously include the popular concept of romanticlove, but it is in no way restricted by it,nor is it diminished through the self-less moral and emotional sacrificedemanded by conventional religion.This kind of “love” is not given indiscriminately nor universally to thedeserving and the undeserving alike.Furthermore it is never directed at some god-being outside the self who requiresadoration beyond reason andabove the self.Setian/initiatory “love” is a love that strengthens, is highly selective andcreative, and facilitates Xeper throughthe honest and sincere feedback it stimulates and provides. “Love”, then, is aninitiatory experience derived from anall-consuming desire to see the self Become and experience Essence.Order MembershipThe OSOM is designed to provide interested Setians with certain tools for Xeperand Remanifestationthrough training, psychodramatic ritual, the sharing of information andmaterials, and the presentation ofindividual and group Dromenon at Conclaves.It is not absolutely necessary that non-Dromen Setians (members of other Orders,or Adepts without Orderaffiliation) interested in being involved in an OSOM Dromenon become Dromen,since the presented material mightwell be the product of work within another Temple of Set Order. To date membersof several Temple of Set Orders(Vampyre, Trapezoid, and Python) have already participated in Dromenon and haveexpressed the interest in doingso again. It is in this way that the OSOM is able to span Orders and serve as ameans whereby individual Setians andgroups (Orders, Pylons, etc.) may join together in the psychodramaticpresentation of a shared magical insight.Initiates who do wish to become members of The Order of the Sepulcher of theObsidian Masque, however,would not only participate as creator/ performers but could also act as resourcepeople in helping any group orindividual in deciding how to approach a given themeritually/psycho-dramatically.It is also expected that Dromen of the Sepulcher present workshops and/orseminars in their areas of expertise(via video tape, audiotape, live presentations at Conclave and regionalconclaves, etc.) to other members of theOrder and/or the Temple of Set.- 424 -Besides research into all areas of Psychodramatic Mythic/Ritual Theater, a majorarea of interest will be theidea of transformation in all its forms [including the assemblage of materialleading to a fuller and more detailedunderstanding of existential death and transcendence].Other areas in which OSOM will attempt to gain insight are sex magic, esotericmodes of non-verbalcommunication (secret sign languages), dance, martial arts & the role played byconflict in initiation, and otherareas of interest which may serve as external expressions of internal archetypalenergies ( neter s), and words ofpower. Notwithstanding, at its very core the OSOM is dedicated to theexamination and intuitive understanding ofthe greatest of mysteries - the Temple of Set as it is made manifest within theliving heart of the Setian magician.Setians interested in joining [or wishing more information regarding] The Orderof the Sepulcher of theObsidian Masque can contact the GM by writing to the Temple of Set address inSan Francisco or speaking with himduring a Conclave.For reasons explained in the Crystal Tablet of Set, only Adepts+ of the Templewill be considered for Ordermembership.Multiple Order membership seems to be the norm among Dromen of the Sepulcher,and is encouraged so longas the Initiate has the time and energy to fulfill all Order commitments.Multiple Order membership also requiresthe written support of all the Grand Masters involved.Dromenic participation will be periodically examined, and non-productive ornon-involved members will beasked to re-examine their self-initiatory needs and expectations. InactiveDromen may also be directed to resignfrom the Order or seek membership in some other Temple of Set Order which isbetter able to suit their needs andinspire their participation.Since magical initiation sometimes requires massive change, all Dromen of theSepulcher are asked to reviewtheir affiliation with the OSOM and determine if it is still providing the kindof creative impetus they have the rightto expect. If change is deemed necessary, then steps will be taken so that theInitiate can find the best method ofcontinuation without the need to jeopardize the integrity of personal Xeper.The OSOM will communicate with the rest of the Temple through a newsletter, TheSepulchral Voice ( S.V. ),which will be produced at irregular intervals whenever sufficient material isavailable to warrant production anddistribution. Order members and all Masters of the Temple will receive the S.V.without charge. All others are askedfor a donation of US$2 (per copy/per issue) to cover postage & handling.Dromen(a) of the Sepulcher are expectedto contribute regularly to the S.V. as well as participate in all Order-orientedactivities.Essent into EssenceLove is the Essence, Love within DeathXeper and RemanifestNotes1. One such meditation is derived from the Yoga Niedra tradition, which means“corpse posture”. Its main goal isto transcend everyday consciousness and find the reality of consciousness whichis the highest expression of theself - the self that is fully awake. It differs from other Yogic practices.however, in that the practitioner visualizeshis own dismemberment, decapitation, and dissolution into nothingness. When astate of “nothingness” isachieved, the visualization continues with the reconstruction of the self. Thefully Remanifested self is imbuedwith all that the individual deems right and worthy, while all undesirablecharacteristics that inhibit therealization of one’s potential are simply not included in the process ofRemanifestation.2. Magus Don Webb tells me of an Aztec/Toltec legend of an obsidian mirror usedfor revelation. He alsoreminded me of the obsidian “shewstone” used by John Dee and Edward Kelly toreceive the Word of Set. Asimilar obsidian mirror is ascribed to Merlin of the Arthurian legends. Thiscould be a very interesting area ofresearch.3. C.

Egypt received nine of these,the rest of the world onemeasure. Talmud, b. Qid. 49bSetne Khamuast wun ’wy nw(t) pet per m kerh r irt merr(t) -f nbt tp-ta m-m’nkaw. [Set-is-Beautiful, Generalof Thebes, who opens the doors of the sky, shall come forth by night to do allhe wishes upon the world among theliving.]I declare that in Year XXX an Order shall Come Into Being bearing the name ofthe world’s first Egyptologistand one of Egypt’s most renowned magicians, the fourth son of Rameses II, SetneKhamuast, whose name Setne canbe rendered in English as “Set-is-Beautiful” or “Set-is-Kind”.As a soldier he distinguished himself in the campaigns in Israel and the Sudan.He is perhaps the author of thefamed lost papyrus “Scroll of Producing Terror and Respect” mentioned in thestory of Rameses III. As anEgyptologist he began a careful series of diggings to claim back from the sandthe monuments that were lost, andmore importantly he created a magical library, the Rameseum, to serve as themortuary chapel of his father. Thisgathering of scrolls in a centralized place for study was a first, and changedEgyptian and eventually world magicalpractice. Because of his interest in magical literature, the Greeks called him“King of the Magicians” and a thousandyears after his death a story was circulated about how he had found the Book ofThoth.As a magician he restored the two Ceremonies of Rebirth connected with the godSet. The first of these is theheb-sed, the “Festival of Set”, practiced for national rebirth. The heb-sedrenews the life of the Pharaoh and theland’s connection with the divine. It is first performed after a Pharaoh hasreigned for thirty years, since in Egyptiannumerology thirty is the number of completion. It may then be performed at thePharaoh’s discretion throughouthis reign. Concerning the effectiveness of the work, Rameses II was thelongest-lived of all Pharaohs, outliving histalented son.The second ceremony was the “Opening of the Mouth”. The Setian aspect of thisceremony has almost destroyedby Osirian overlays. But the most important aspect - the tool called thePesh-Kent knife made in the shape of Set’sforked tail and fashioned out of iron ( bia-en-pet = the metal from the sky) -became Setne’s personal emblem. Heserved as High Priest of Thebes and Chief Sem Priest. Those of you who have seenhis statue in the British Museumhave seen him dressed as Sem Priest wearing the original garb of the SetianPriest: the spotted leopard-skin of thesouth, a reverse-color image of the night sky ruled by Set.Order members will perform a twofold function. They will discover the treasuresof antiquity, and they will beable to present them to the Temple not as interesting curiosities of mankind’spast, but as working formulæ adaptednot only to the present, but crafted to producing a stronger, more powerfulTemple in the future. There is a threefoldprocess by which this may be accomplished:First, begin with the best, hardest, most recent scholarship you can find. TheOSK doesn’t grow from semi-digested old sources. And above all beware of the many “occultnik” glosses onancient practices. For too long thetradition of the South has been the home of idiots.Second, when you find among those good sources that mysterious thing that callsto you, study it well. Beginwith the objective facts first, and then re-enact as appropriate for your life.Try until you get results! Then turn youreyes inward and see how it has affected your initiation. If you see a positiveeffect on your Xeper, then you are readyfor the third phase.Third, communicate what you have learned. I’m not talking about a long, dryarticle full of Egyptian and Greekterms [although scholarly publication, particularly outside of the Temple, isencouraged], but rather the task ofcommunicating personal initiation to other Initiates. Extract the processes ofthe ancient formulæ and present themto the Temple, for learning to teach something is the first step to its mastery.Although the Order’s studies will primarily focus on Egyptian practice, othersinterested in the South arewelcome in the hopes that other Orders will grow from this Order just as the OSKgrows from my own pilgrimage tothe Land of Eternal Day in the Order of the Trapezoid. In addition to the studyof classical Egypt some areas ofinterest will be:1. The magic and philosophy of Græco-Roman Egypt.2. Greek, Semitic, Mesopotamian, “Old European”, Phoenician, African, and Latinmagical traditions andpractices.3. The use of Egyptian motifs in European magical traditions.4. The practice of Lesser Black Magic using antique themes, or how to astonishyour friends and neighborsby remembering you were Tutankhamen.- 426 -The Order will have an Outer Court and an Inner Court. Outer Court affiliationwill be very informal, consistingof a simple desire to examine the order, attend its workings, or joining a Phylewhile pursuing a particular Initiationin an another Order. The Inner Court consists of formal obligation to the Order.Entering the Inner Court will bothrequire and cause a change in the Initiate’s relationship to the ObjectiveUniverse, which will affect not only theseeker but will remanifest throughout all of the Temple and finally the world.Groups may form from time to time to pursue specific activities. They willcalled Phyles (Greek term for hard-to-pronounce za), the Egyptian name for a crew of craftsmen based on ancientUpper Egyptian social organization.Phyles are to be headed by Inner Court members, and may pursue any topic ofinterest. They may last for a week orbe as the sands of time, they may have non-OSK members.There is no planned newsletter yet, but if it should be desired, it will becalled the D’ Elmet Setne ( The MagicalWord Gathering of Setne).There is another purpose to the Order, which I may only hint at here. On August24, 394 ev. the lasthieroglyphic inscription was written by a Priest of Isis at her shrine on theisland of Philæ. He no doubt met hisdeath during the terrible Christian persecutions that characterized early FifthCentury Egypt. The Copts brag of thedestruction of Philæ claiming that one of their saints caused the Nile to floodover it. It has been sixteen hundredyears and I think it’s time to make the waters recede.- 427 -A82: The Order of Shuti- by Robert Menschel IV°, Grand MasterI. IntroductionShu and Tefnut, the twin lion gods, are opposites. Shu and Tefnut are male andfemale, hot and cold, dry andwet, public and private, intellectual and emotional, et cetera and so forth.Alone, either one would be dangerously unbalanced, and would have earned an evilreputation for his or herexcesses. But Shu and Tefnut are always together. Each defines the other; eachrequires the other. Each balancesand tempers the other. Shu’s most prominent headpiece, the feather of Ma’at,emphasizes this balance, as does therepresentation of Shu through the use of this feather alone, as a singlehieroglyph. Shuti is Shu and Tefnut together,under one name, as one composite being.The Order of Shuti is dedicated to the study of Opposition and Balance,Opposition in Balance, Balance inOpposition, and Balance through Opposition. More, we will pursue Xeper throughBalance, and Xeper throughOpposition. By “Opposition” we don’t mean just conflict (though of course thatis included). We will study and useopposites, the actions and forces of these opposites, the ranges of existencebetween these opposites, the balance ofthese opposites, and the dynamic magical implications thereof.One obsolete philosophy of magic was that to achieve balance, the magician hadto experience and participate inthe extremes (often the extremes of good and evil).There are simply too many different pairs of opposites and extremes for amagician to experience them all.Further, many extremes are downright dangerous, such as extreme hot and cold,unnecessarily evil and unlawfulacts, and excessively self-sacrificing acts. But the Initiate of Shuti willrecognize and work with any and allopposites/extremes, and with the ranges and balances between them, whenever andhowever appropriate.“For with no purpose the force of the mind must fail ...” This study ofopposition and balance can support manydiverse goals.One such purpose will be to study and understand the physical and objectiveuniverse, and to study andunderstand the magical and subjective universe, so that we may change thoseuniverses in accordance with ourWills (per the challenge of Michael, found in the Diabolicon’s Statement ofSatan ArchDaimon).Other goals and purposes are and will be supported; this is but one which hasbeen defined and will be offeredto interested Initiates. Any and all sets of opposites will be valid andappropriate areas of study for the Initiate. Theuniverses are our library and our laboratory. But some topics will be of globalinterest:Life and Death are the major pair of Opposites. We will work to recognize allforms and degrees of theseopposites. We will work to always strive for Life, to always reject Death.One set of Opposites of major interest is Self and Not-Self. How do we defineour Selves? When we Remanifestcontinued existence without these bodily shells, how will we then define ourSelves? How will we differentiatebetween personal Xeper and the willful modification of the external universe?We will also study Set and the Opposite Self, HarWer. We will study them asindividual entities, as OppositeSelves, and as Satan (Set and HarWer fused).Related to these above topics, we will examine the opposites of your own HigherSelf, that towards which youXeper, and your Lower Self, that which you Will outgrow.II. ActivitiesThe most visible activity of the Order of Shuti is its newsletter, Dialogues.Published on an irregular schedule[due to the Grand Master’s time restraints, certainly not due to a lack ofmaterial], the newsletter contains activediscussions of a large variety of topics, reports of progress made in variousareas of endeavor, and more.The Order of Shuti also indulges in a high level of correspondence between itsmembers, on topics listed aboveand others of interest to the members. Most correspondence is betweenindividuals, but from time to time selectcorrespondence will be shared with the entire Order membership.The Order of Shuti also hosts open activities at Conclaves, to which allConclave attendees are welcome. Finallythe Order hosted a weekend workshop several years ago, to which many Setianswere invited, and we plan to holdmore workshops in the future.Other pairs of opposites are knowledge and ignorance, ability and inability,comprehension andnoncomprehension, perception and nonperception, etc. Shu is a god of knowledge,the light of the sun. WithTefnut’s influence, Shuti is a god of active Satanic enlightenment. We thereforeexpect the Order’s Initiates toactively contribute material to the Scroll of Set and the Ruby Tablet of Set. Wealso expect the Order’s Initiates toparticipate in, assist, and/or lead Pylons as appropriate, whether local Pylons,correspondence Pylons [like theGates of Hell], or otherwise.- 428 -III. Affiliation and ParticipationThe Order of Shuti is a fairly “open” and available Order. Our newsletter,Dialogues, is available by subscriptionto all Setians. We publish our major works in the Ruby Tablet of Set. We welcomedialogue with all Setiansconcerning any Order topic of interest.Because of this, some Setians may wonder, “Why should I join the Order of Shuti,when I can have all of itsbenefits without joining it?” The answer is that Setians outside of the orderdon’t get all of its benefits. There iscorrespondence within the Order which is not published. Order members haveopportunities for Xeper which arenot readily made available outside the Order. Order members have more direct andfrequent contact with the GrandMaster. Etc.How can an Adept formally affiliate with the Order of Shuti? Order membership isclosely tied to activeparticipation with the Order. [Order members will be - and have been - expelledfor a lack of participation.Allowances are made, of course, for time restrictions due to schooling and otherhigh priority elements of Xeper.]Interested Adepts should therefore: (1) correspond with the Grand Masterdiscussing your interest, and (2)participate in the Order’s activities.This participation includes reading and contributing to Dialogues, andcorrespondence with Order membersand/or the Grand Master on topics of interest to you. You should also developyour ideas through research and/ordiscussion, and submit the results of your work to Dialogues, the Scroll of Set,and/or the Ruby Tablet of Set.After having demonstrated your interest in and participation with the Order ofShuti, you may then apply tothe Grand Master for formal admission to the Order. Such application normallywill be approved after a fairly shortreview.- 429 -A83: The Order of Taliesin- by Eric Kauschen IV°, Grand MasterIf music be the staff of life, play on!- William ShakespeareMusic is a living, breathing thing. Every piece of music can exist as a ritualthat can be performed over and overagain. Few musicians are aware of these, even fewer people are aware of this.Rituals that are based around musicand media are extremely powerful and cause the celebrant to flow with theenvironment they are in leaving theenviroment outside of the ritual chamber. This is an area that needs furtherexploration.There have been many musicians within the Temple, but very few of them havespoken about this. It is time forthis to change. The creation of music and media has come into the hands of morepeople, and because of that thereis more poorly-produced and understood music and media make available today.The name of the Order comes from Taliesin, Chief Bard of Britain and Celticshaman, a historical figure wholived in Wales during the latter half of the sixth century. His verse isestablished as a direct precursor to theArthurian Legends. and Taliesin himself, shaman and shapeshifter, is said to bethe direct forebear of Merlin.Initiates of the Temple of Set who hold the degree of Adept or higher may seekadmittance to the Order ofTaliesin by writing to the Grand Master, but be forewarned: this is not an Orderfor people who just like music. It isan Order for those with a good understanding of music and media who want tolearn more in exchange for offeringwhat they know.The Order of Taliesin will work in the following areas as well as others as theOrder grows:1. Music composition and performance2. Audio recording and production3. Multimedia composition and productionThe Order of Taliesin was not created to be a large Order, but to take thenatural Black Magical skills in everymusician and develop and expand upon them.If music be the staff of life, play on!- 430 -A84: The Order of Uart- by Linda Reynolds IV°, Grand MasterOriginally named Order of Python, this Order was founded in 1979 by MagistraLinda Reynolds and then-Magistra Nancy Flowers. Their intent was for it to be an Order for theexploration of art and magic. In 1997 PriestessHeather Lee Ayres, who had been in the Order since shortly after its conception,was named Acting Grand Master byMagistra Reynolds. Priestess Ayres felt it absolutely necessary to Remanifestthe creative essence out of its longstagnation for the Order to survive. The Python was magically laid to rest andcremated, with the UART manifestingfrom its ashes.Uart is an Egyptian term that means “the artist’s quarter”: a place ofbifurcation or division (i.e. the Guild/Temenos structure within the Order. If seen as two words, U and Art means the“well of the Flame in the GreatOasis”, the source of Dark inspiration and imagination within the Temple of Set.The work of the OU is based upon the “Nine Perceptions of Heka-An”: theinitiatory significance of art that wasrevealed to Priestess Ayres on March 21, 1997. These Nine Perceptions are:1. Art in itself is a valid form of expression.2. Art is a record of one’s initiation.3. Art is the Magical Link between the subjective and objective universes.4. Creativity is a process of the Black Flame.5. Art is a historical record of culture.6. The artist becomes immortal in the objective universe.7. The artist becomes immortal in the subjective universe.8. The state of mind achieved during an act of creation is a gateway forcommunication with the Prince ofDarkness.9. Throughout the act of creation, the mind of Set can begin to become known.Artists - members of the Order - may work with one or any combination of theseperceptions that best suit theirindividual path, but are expected to minimally produce ARTifacts to carry thehistory and culture of the Temple ofSet into the coming millennia, affect the objective universe through their workby unleashing it into the world viagallery shows, publication, performance in a theatre, etc., reflect theirevolving Set nature in their work, andparticipate in the Order’s Xeper by putting forth their ideas and projectswithin their Guild or to the Order as awhole. These are the criteria for being recognized as a Master of the Uart.Within the Order are nine Neter Guilds that work within a specific area of art.These are Acting/PerformanceArt; Computer Graphics/Photography; Dance; Drawing/Painting; Music;Sculpture/Jewelry; Textiles; Magical ToolMaking; and Writing. Each artist works within a primary Guild but is not limitedto that specific artform. As long asone is productive in a chosen Guild, one is free to work in as many as drivento.Within these Guilds are temenos (studios) which are each artist’s personalworking space, wherein all artformsthat the artist works in are made manifest. A temenos is the subjective magicaluniverse, while the studio is theobjective place of business. Just as each Setian is the center of the universe,each temenos is the core of the Uart.The Order produces an annual work presented to the Temple, and publishes anewsletter entitled Art en Ptah(“Document of Ptah”) as submissions warrant.The Uart is open by invitation to II°+ Initiates of the Temple of Set who areablaze with the fire of creation, arecompelled to know and express themselves by and through their artwork, and whowork their most powerful magicthrough their art.Dual Order membership is acceptable as long as it does not diminish theinteraction and focus of the Initiate’swork in either Order.Obtaining entrance to the Uart is a process that begins by interested Initiatessubmitting to the Grand Mastervia the Temple office: (1) a sample of their artwork (photographs or copies areacceptable), and (2) a written briefmanifesto of what/why/how they intend to proceed with their work in the contextof their initiation, the Uart, andthe Temple of Set.Behold the genius of your creation!- 431 -A85: The Order of the Vampyre- by Lilith Aquino V° & William T. Butch IV°, Grand MastersThe Order of the Vampyre is an order which embraces the concepts of vampyricpresence as a means to personalpower and potential immortality. Vampyrism is a unique Black Magical conditionthat in and of its very naturerequires a posture which enables a natural and effortless exchange of power fromthe lesser to the greater. In normalcommunication this power is evidenced by the psychological control exerted overothers. Through our Black Magicthis power is evidenced by accessing what is known as lucid dreaming, andincreasingly gaining mastery over thatstate of Becoming which is desirable in its own right.Vampyrism goes back to time immemorial, and true vampyrism can be traced back inmany cultures around theworld, and is therefore known by many different names. A true vampyre knows thathe does not achieve the postureof effortless power through the mundane act of physical blood-drinking. In factto pursue such acts would mean thathe did not understand his own condition, let alone vampyric Black Magic.Through Xeper, the Word of the Æon of Set, members of this Order will strive tobring to life those qualities andaspects of our potential which have long been considered to be dead or latent.Communication is a cornerstone of our work. Members of the Order willcommunicate effectively in order tomaintain that concert which will be our collective effort.The Order’s founders undertook research that brought them into a dialogue with,and the acquaintance ofexisting vampyric characteristics and archetypal forces. They were examining,testing, and proving to themselvesthrough direct experience how many of the alleged vampyric powers - such asinvisibility, manipulation, the powerof sound and breath, etc. - were real and were useable. Many of these samepowers are of course harnessed by non-OV Setians.Through the great Black Magic, and in ways that are special to the Children ofthe Night, we seek to furtherenhance and augment such powers. On a lesser level these powers will beevidenced in social communications,resulting in personal power as measured by social position, wealth, and personalfreedom. On a greater level, byachieving control of the lucid dreaming state, these powers will be the directexperience of vampyres in a world oftheir own creation, which can also be potentially shared.Vampyres can be hideous as well as noble by nature. Vampyres can also be - andare - glamorous. Those who aremembers of the Order of the Vampyre will learn to perfect such skills as theapplication of cosmetics, the use of thevoice in subtle ways (including the embedding of commands in one’s phrases), andthe act of holding another’s gazeto influence, to distract, to control. All of these are designed to enhance thecreation of the vampyric posture suchthat power flows to the vampyre for both lesser and greater goals.It is our desire that our school for vampyres address the vampyre at all levels,and that our teachings have apractical application in the world. Hence all of these are steps towards theformation of a more compleat Setian, amore compleat vampyre.As such, powers of imagination and visualization are employed by members in thisOrder. Therefore art, music,and literature can and will be used as tools for our Order members. Within ourschool for vampyres will arise thosewho specialize in certain aspects of vampyrism and its proper application. Theseschools within our school, as wellas other directions and things yet to come to this Order, are to be decided byits Masters and members.There will be those who first learn more about the Arkte Element here, who thenbecome warriors. There will beothers who first learn of the MetaMind Element here, and who will thenspecialize in it. Each of these schools withina school will either be an official office or function of the Temple of Set, orwill be informally controlled or helmed bya Master or senior member of the Order.Applicants will be considered for admission to the Order by an existing Masterof the Order (preferably), or by aIII°+ member of the Order at large, or by one of the Grand Masters themselves.In most cases, if a Master of theOrder deems a Setian is appropriate for the Order, that Setian’s membership willalmost always be guaranteed. Inall cases, however, the decision to admit a Setian will be at the solediscretion of one or both Co-Grand Masters.Either or both Co-Grand Masters will decide favorably on the applicant if he/sheis (a) particularly well-suited forthe Order and (b) has the necessary amount of time and degree of commitment forsuch specialized work. Questionsconcerning membership into the Order, or about aspects of the vampyric being,may be addressed to any Master ofthe Order (preferably), also to any III°+ member of the Order at large, or toeither Co-Grand Master.- 432 -A86: The Order of the Wells of Wyrd- by Rebecca Lance IV°, Grand MasterAn ash I know, Yggdrasil by nameWith water white is the great tree wet;Thence come the dews that fall in the dales,Green by Urdh’s well does it ever grow.Thence come the maidens mighty in wisdom,Three from the dwelling down ’neath the tree;Urdh is one named, Verdhandi the next -On the wood they scored - and Skuld the third.Laws they made there, and life allottedTo the sons of men, and set their fates.With these lines from the Voluspa is introduced a magical working model of theinteraction between space andtime:At the axis of the Universe stands a tree, Yggdrasil by name. In itsbranches lie the worlds of both gods and men.From beneath its roots springs a well of silvery water - the Well of Wyrd,Urdh’s Well. Any actions from within theWorlds, any events, any “doings” or “sayings”, manifest as drops of water thatfall like silvery drops of dew from thebranches of Yggdrasil into the Well of Wyrd at the base of the tree.The tree is tended by three Norns - Urdh, Verdhandi and Skuld. Urdh - what hasbecome; Verdhandi - thatwhich is becoming; and Skuld - that which should become. The Norns tend thewaters of the Well. They set the fatesof men, and water the Tree with the waters of the Well.The cycle is clear: the past flows to the future, which in turn becomes part ofa formative past. It is important tonote that in this model there is no room for a predetermined “future”. Newactions, new layers in the Well are notmerely stacked on top of each other as a linear archaeological record of thepast. Each event, each action that occursin the Tree drips down and mixes throughout the waters in an integrativefashion. The past- a fluid repository of allactions and events in the tree - is mutable, ever-changing. The potential futurethat flows from it fluxes as well.The Initiate, as a self-contained manifestation of the Black Flame, has theopportunity to work directly with thisflux and flow. Each willed moment is a magical event. The present is thatinfinitesimally thin interface betweenwhat-has-been and what that moment can become. The present is a transformativemoment because it directs theflow of Wyrd and transforms all that has gone before, and all that will follow.Reception-transformation-re-expression.WellsThe Well of Wyrd is just one of many mythical wells to be explored within theOrder.In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil, the World tree, has three distinct rootsextending into three wells. The Well ofWyrd as a whole is actually composed of the tripartite series of these wells. Aroot surrounding Ginnungagap feedsfrom Mimir’s Well. This is the well into which Odhinn sacrificed one of hiseyes, that he might see into the worldsand obtain wisdom. It may be said to be the Well of Perception.A root extends into Niflheim and is associated with the well Hvergelmir.Hvergelmir is known as the RoaringKettle, or Seething Cauldron. In its bubbling, seething waters are the source ofintegrative synthesis.Urdh’s Well nourishes and sustains the root which extends into Asgard, the realmof the Aesir. In old Norse,Urdh’s Well is known as Urdhar-brunnr. The term “Brunnr” has been translatedinto English as “well”, but the wordis much more potent than that. Brunnr represents a spring or a well that iscentrally located. It also represents thesource of that well, the power that allows the well to fill, and the containerof the well itself.There is a difference between water that arises from a spring in a marsh andspreads out over the ground, andwater that arises through a deep shaft cut in stone, or through a rift in therocky earth. The water that is not boundor contained spreads out over the ground and rapidly becomes mud. Water thatarises through a defining source,however, retains its purity and its connection to that source. “Brunnr”represents not only the waters of the well, buttheir source, and that aspect of containment or boundary that allows the well toretain its purity and magical charge.The only etymological descendant of “brunnr” found in English is the word“bourne”. Hence the name of theOrder’s newsletter, Bourne of Wyrd.For the Initiate to become an effective interface between what-has-been andwhat-should-be, he/she mustincrease powers of awareness: Awareness of the worlds, awareness of limitationsand boundaries, awareness ofmind and body.The foundation work of the Order is largely composed with increasing theseawarenesses, and learning how towork with the resultant new perceptions.- 433 -The cosmology described in the preceding paragraphs is intrinsically Norse, butit illustrates a concept that isuniversal: the flow of patterns and the movement of the patterning principle asit sculpts a new future out of allactions that have become.In the Order of the Wells of Wyrd, we will call this flow-from “what has been”,to “that which could become” -the Flow of Wyrd. Work within the Order will center around apprehending theFlow. To attempt to comprehendWyrd is to attempt to understand the very thing that allows happenings tomanifest. Most of us were raisedprimarily from within the comforting rational causalities of Newtonian physics.Drop the apple; it falls. Tocomprehend Wyrd, however, is to attempt to perceive a paradigm of causality thattranscends linear cause andeffect. It is beyond microscopic and cosmic. It is both and neither.For Initiate of the O.W.W., the ultimate magical goal is to learn to direct theFlow of Wyrd in a willed fashion.Each of our initiatory paths flowers from within a matrix of Wyrd. Apprehendingand directly working with thismatrix will be the Great Work of the Order. We must learn to bring to the watersthose things that will sustain ourmagical worlds and nourish the manifestations of our Wills.Avenues of ExplorationThe avenues of exploration of the Order are multifold, and will not all beoutlined here. It is expected, however,that the following three basic avenues should be explored by each Initiate.(1) Subjective StatesTo fully apprehend Wyrd, the Initiate may chose to actively explore receptiveand subjective states: altered ordiscrete states of consciousness. For our purposes, an altered state will beconsidered to be any discrete state ofconsciousness that is somehow different from our “normal” waking state. Thisincludes meditative states, hypnoticstates, dream states, and trance states.To perceive something in its entirety, it is helpful to “view” it from manydifferent perspectives. By experiencingalterations in consciousness, we allow ourselves to expand our perception, andapprehension of Wyrd. The term“Altered States of Consciousness” (ASC) has become popularized in modernculture, but perhaps a better termwould be “Altered States of Perception” (ASP). This more aptly explains thepurpose of the state within the Order.Altered states are one way to explore powerful causal connections in our worldand ourselves: Learning to luciddream, one can regain control over nightmares, and discover that one’s daytimefears change in quality as a result.Learning to focus visualizations of energy while in a meditative state, one maylearn to utilize healing techniques.Learning to inject intent into any number of limenal states offers the Initiatean enormous range of tools with whichto work.(2) Body/Kinesthetic AwarenessAs the body/mind framework is the most direct way to apprehend and transform theFlow of Wyrd, anawareness of body/mind states and energies are vital. Initiates will beencouraged to develop their own innerawareness of their physical being through some discipline. Dance, martial arts,yoga - all are excellent avenues. Forsome Initiates, frequent meditations on kinesthetic awareness may proveeffective(3) Building an Objective StructureDue to the morpheous and inherently individualistic quality of subjectivestates, the initiate benefits enormouslyfrom having a symbolic structure or model to frame these experiences on. This ishow we give them meaning.Visions only have a voice if they speak our language. Most Setians are quitecapable of developing their ownsymbolic language with which to interpret and work subjective states. This isvital, but insufficient. We need to beable to share and communicate these states and explorations. We must seekuniversals. We must be able to find thecommon threads that hold our magical experiences together.Therefore the Initiate will be expected to become familiar with academic,cultural, or scientific studies relatingto his or her individual experience. Depending on the Initiates experiences , heor she may need to researchtraditional magical systems, or delve into philosophical structures as diverseas quantum physics, or Chinesemedicine The idea behind such an avenue of study is to find the universal threadthat holds the magical experiencetogether. Hopefully, in so doing, we will also learn a way to better communicateour experiences with each other.An Order Between OrdersIt is expected that there will develop with the Order certain mutual focalpoints of interest between members.These focal points will be known as Wells. Current active Wells include the Wellof Dreams, which intensivelystudies dream and sleep states, and the Well of Healing.- 434 -Work within the Order will also be very closely connected to and supported byits sister organization - Urdh’sHouse - a House within the Order of the Trapezoid. Current active Foci withinUrdh’s House include a Focus onSeidhr, a Focus on Dreams, and a Focus on the Way of the Warrior.As the work of the Order of the Wells of Wyrd will closely tie in and besupported by the work of other Orders,the O.W.W. may be seen at times as an “Order between Orders”, a well ofintegrating focus.Members of the O.W.W. who belong to other orders will be mandated to carry thework of Wyrd to members ofother Orders in a way that will benefit all.For Initiates who do not belong to other Orders, the O.W.W. should become aplace where they can learn tointimately integrate multifaceted aspects of life and Work.“Apprehension” and “Transformation”These are key words of the Order.Through this work it is expected that the Initiate will learn to become a Masterof his/her own destiny - and tolearn what “destiny” really is.- 435 -A87: The Order of Xnum- by William D. Pridgen IV°, Grand MasterI am Xnum, your maker! My arms are around you, to steady your body, to safeguardyour limbs. Ibestow on you stones upon stones; since former times nobody ever worked withthem to build the templesof the gods. For I am the master who makes, I am he who makes himself exalted inNun, who first cameforth, Hapy who hurries at will; fashioner of everybody, guide of each man.- The Dream of Zoser, Col. 18-20 of the Famine Stele"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThe Order of Xnum is the philosophy department of the Temple of Set. Its focusis the practice of philosophy asan initiatory discipline. Philosophy has been translated from the Greek as“passion for wisdom”. Initiates of theOrder of Xnum will demonstrate this passion through the active pursuit andgradual embodiment of wisdom.Xnum is the personification par excellence of that which guides and informs thephilosopher’s path. ByHellenistic times the cult of Xnum had been absorbed into the cult ofagathodaimon because Xnum, as is quotedabove, was understood to be the “fashioner of everybody, guide of each man”. Asthis dovetails rather nicely with theSocratic tradition of the daimon and the Platonic principle of the agathon, it’snot surprising that such a synthesisoccurred.While Pythagoras was the first person to call himself a philosopher, the cult ofagathodaimon was at its heightin Hellenistic times, when the Greeks had identified the Egyptian decan Xnm as acomposite of stars from theirconstellations Hydra and Leo. Thus has come down to us the familiar symbol ofthe Æon as a composite lion-serpent. As Black Magicians, Initiates of the Order of Xnum will drawinspiration from the historical impact thisprinciple has had by recovering and putting into practice the magical records ofthis ageless academy.Affiliation and ExpectationsMembership in the Order of Xnum is available to II°-VI° Setians. Interested I°swho have some background orinterest in the humanities may begin dialogue with the Grand Master towardspossible future affiliation. This shouldnot, however, take precedence over learning and applying basic Setian principlesas outlined in the Crystal Tablet ofSet. Dialogue at this level will focus exclusively on the essentials of Setianphilosophy.Initiates of the Order of Xnum are responsible for understanding the basics ofSetian philosophy and pursuing itas a way of life. This lifestyle, as summarized in the Word Xeper, should beevident in the thoughts, words and deedsof the Setian philosopher. Part of this lifestyle is achieved through thepractice of LBM, the foundation from whichthe pursuit of greater mysteries becomes possible. Through GBM the Setianphilosopher attempts to tap into theliving Æon, so that personal insight may become undiluted by changing the natureof perception. Beyond thesegeneral goals are the following specific tasks:What an Order Member Does1. Reads contemporary and classical philosophy (From Heraclitus to Whitehead).2. Is able to discuss, with Setians and non-Setians, philosophical ideas andoffer examples of theirapplication in day-to-day life.3. Works on deep applications/investigations of traditional problems in ethics,ontology, andepistemology within a Setian context.4. Works on a magical level with daimonic guidance/information (with specialreference to daimonicinvocations in the Magical papyri).5. Will become familiar with current daimonic thought outside of the Temple (forexample Jung, Iyer orHillman).6. Can describe Setian thought to non-Setians in nonsectarian language, and doesso.7. Develops a good bullshit detector, and applies skepticism to modernoccultism, parapsychology,politics, and other con games - and can help others to do so with humor, graceand good spirit.8. Identifies and supports movements resonant with the Order’s orientation inthe objective universe andfinds schools for furthering his goals (of learning and self-transformation)there as well.- 436 -9. Reports on these activities with justifiable pride and sensible humility tothe Grand Master, themembers of the Order, the Temple, and Worthy friends in the world at large -carefully explaining tothem (and to himself) how these actives lead to a desired state ofself-transformation.Every question is a rung on the ladder to godhood. Invoke often!Above I stated that philosophy is the discipline of the pursuit and gradualembodiment of wisdom. I also statedthat Xnum was a personification of the guiding and informing principle of thisdiscipline. Xnum represents areconciliation between HarWer and Set. His goals and adversities parallel thoseof Set, while also incorporatingmany of the positive qualities of HarWer. Xnum’s primary goals are thecultivation of life towards higher forms, thepursuit of self-knowledge and creation on various levels of existence. This hasclose ties with Magister Menschel’sconcept of Setagenesis, but within the Order of Xnum it is referred to asARI-KAT (“to process, to synthesize, tomanufacture”). Initiates of the Order of Xnum will seek to uncover deepermeanings beyond the obvious.The Order of Xnum is a Remanifestation of the cult of agathodaimon, which is thecult of bringing into beingthe essential Self through the discipline of philosophy. Like the ancientGreeks, we will pare mythology andsymbolism down to the bare essentials. Philosophy allows us to discuss uncommonthings in a common (albeitprecise) language. We will in turn be able to use mythology and symbolism in amore potent way because of ourcomprehension of principles. Thus we work in the spirit of the ancient Hermetictradition, which is the spirit ofcooperative individualism. There is room for both reason and magic in the worldswe create.ConclusionThe Setian mind hungers for knowledge - the most essential knowledge beingSelf-knowledge. Setianepistemology can therefore be said to be rooted in ontology - or as one SetianMagus expressed it: “The only truth isthat of being!” The Setian philosophy, as summarized in the Word Xeper,advocates the principles of life,dynamism, and self-awareness, as much as it opposes death, stasis, andself-delusion. These are mirrored withinand beyond the Setian, as he struggles to perform the alchemy of transformingthe self that is yet to be into the Selfthat Is To Be!- 437 -A88: Remanifestation: The Process Explained- by James Lewis V°September 13, 1989It is by necessity of the initiation that each Magus set forth the principles ofhis Word and those aspects of itwhich exist with both contemporary life and the Words previous to it. A Word,whether of the primary or Æon-enhancing kind, must have relevance to the chemistry of life. It is the duty ofthe one who Utters it to show theprinciple at work. It is not the duty of the Magus to do all the work involvedwith his principle; instead he sharessuch Understandings as his intellect is able to translate into comprehensiblelanguage so that others may put hisperceptions to the test. It is for this reason that while the Degree of Magus isuncluttered by obscurity and is in factthe most easily understandable of all Grades, the difficulty associated with itis in its successful functioning. No onewould have ever been able to convey the full weight of that to me prior tohaving personally experienced it and itmay be that one or more of you reading this may one day undergo that freakoccurrence which we name the FifthDegree. Future Magi have now been forewarned!Remanifest was initially a Word which answered the question of continuation ofthe Self after the metabolicprocesses of the biological envelope eventually ceased. The finer points of timecycles and manipulation at firstescaped me, as did the daily Willed function of the principle at work in boththe Initiatory aspects and those comingabout as a naturally occurring action. The Word is a tool through which thepower of Xeper can be more skillfullyused to make the most of the core of the Wewelsburg Working, itself an unveilingof the dynamic force operating asthe focal point from which stem all deliberate and a majority of the accidentaland coincidental acts Initiates andnon-Initiates alike encounter. In that sense it is present side by side withXeper in that an absence of either wouldcause the machinery of the Self to grind to a halt. The deliberate and ethicalpursuit of the theory and dynamics ofXeper cannot but produce a Remanifestation through which newer and more refineduses of previously gatheredknowledge can be put into practice. This in turn creates a further Xeper andanother option to Remanifest anew.This continuation can and will take place as long as the hand-in-hand process isWilled to persevere. Our earlypredecessors, the inhabitants of ancient Khem, did not think of time as beinglinear, but rather as circular andcycling its occurrences through progressive accumulations of events andinfluences. Such insights as theirs havemore than an incidental meaning for the questing Magician and in fact assist inextending his grasp of the way inwhich it is possible [and inevitable] that he will Remanifest. It is in accordwith the principle of Xeper that all Willedand even accidental actions which move the individual build up to a point atwhich a being emerges who for allpractical purposes is a newly made presence on the planet. Such a result is oneof the aims of the Initiatory process.Eventually the exploring mind must ask what the Self can/will Come Into Being asin a long term sense. Acomplete and definitive answer to that question is not available to us for thesimple reason that no one can foretellthe future. [What a dull world it would be if we could!] It may be thatincreasingly sophisticated Remanifestationswill produce a Self unlike any that contemporary man can conceive of by today’sstandards - I rather suspect thatwill be exactly the case. Given the force of Thelema still making itself felt,there is in point of fact no limit to whatcan come to be. Neither is there anything outside of man which is able todestroy the soul’s ability to assert itspresence in any way it perceives as proper and just. Life, once understood, is atreasure not to be thoughtlessly castaside at whim. It is the basic key to immortality through the doors of newforms.The Trail of the Serpent is the newsletter of the Order of Leviathan. Since XIXit has covered different facets ofthe way in which individuals and groups Remanifest. It did so prior to the Wordreceiving V° Recognition andsubsequently has continued to serve as one of the vehicles for its ongoingexplorations. Those nuances of the Worduncovered there have advanced far beyond anything I could have expected andindeed have surpassed a number oftimes beyond what I had at the time thought of as the most comprehensiveinsights possible into the principle. It isintellectually and Magically satisfying to encounter new facets which previouslyhad been missed. It is even moresatisfying to see the Word being tested and used by those bearers of the BlackFlame for whom it was intended.Those who put the augmenting implement to Xeper into practice find themselvesmore successful in their Hegelianquests to uncover that knowledge of Set spoken of in the Book of Coming Forth byNight. This advantage is notapplicable to my own Word only, but is germane to an appreciation of Thelema,Indulgence, Xeper, and evenRestriction, that Word of Sin spoken of by HarWer. The practical asset of it allhas the far more long-reaching effectswhich Coleridge saw as far back as 1833 CE: “If a man is not rising upwards tobe an angel, depend upon it, he issinking downwards to be a devil. He cannot stop at the beast. The most savage ofmen are not beasts; they areworse, a great deal worse.”The angel and devil references are not unworthy of Magicians’ attention. In thecontext of Coleridge’s pennedwords and our Æon, “angel” need not be dismissed as representing an effetewinged servant. Neither should “devil”be thought of solely as a vessel of malice. The quote as seen through the eyesof present day discernment moreaccurately portrays the angelic as a symbol of the aristos and the devilish asthat which selfishly plots a course forthe perverted use of life in order to cause harm and mutation rather thanbeneficial evolution. Such destructivebehavior must eventually find itself undergoing the same fate Ipsissimus Crowleydescribed the Black Brothers assuffering: a slow and sure disintegration of the self into the nothingness ofoblivion.- 438 -This is not to say that those who are deliberate in their evil are doomed to aJudgement Day-type retribution.Just as those who sincerely Will to Come Into Being as the highest and bestpossible states of Being are successful intheir endeavors, so the small and selfish also have an opportunity to escape theannihilation of consciousness.Survival, in the long run, does not depend on the shell which houses the soul,but rather on that core self which maygo by the name each individual feels most comfortable with, be it soul, ba, ka,psyche, or whatever. It is all a matterof Willing (in the purely Thelemic sense) one’s personal future. And, I mightadd, the yet-to-be is not fixed; it issubject to change and may alter itself by the moment, thereby lending itself asa tool working equally well in thehands of the good and evil. The crux of the entire process is a properunderstanding of not only what is being done,but why it is being carried out. Hence, when Initiate A aligns his determinationin the direction of increasing hisfund of Magical knowledge, he is successful even if the results do not makeimmediate sense. He has taken the sumof his knowledge and skills to that moment and concentrated them on his questfor truths. His Xeper has broughtabout a Remanifestation which makes his personal Coming Into Being more culturedthan before. He could just aseasily have changed the intent of the Working to bring about an increasedperception of the paths of evil andRemanifested as a more worldly-wise monster. In both cases the hypotheticalInitiate opens doors to new states ofbeing and has thereby the option of continuing what he has begun. The eventualdisintegration has a greater chanceof taking place in the pursuit of evil because malice is in the end a limitingthing leading to the door to annihilation.Sooner or later it must fall under the domination of the Word of Sin and finditself without a purpose - just so muchdestruction can take place before there is nothing left to obliterate. The soulis then left in a cosmos made empty byitself.The author of Words from the Æon of HarWer to the present has been soughtthrough as many singularavenues as there have been individuals setting their feet on the Path. The Æonof HarWer, as recounted in the Bookof Coming Forth by Night, was marked by confusion as its Magus did his bestunwittingly or not to surround theprinciples of the initiating Æon with as much extraneous material as was humanlypossible. As much as IpsissimusCrowley has my personal admiration, his predilection for piling the obscure onin heaping doses often leads me to astate of exasperation with his works. After all, why describe the dynamics ofair intake, nerve action/reaction, andthe force of air expulsion in cryptic jargon when it is more direct to use theword “sneeze” and be done with it. Thefault is not totally DCLXVI’s - his god had a great deal of the fitful abouthim. Things, to put it mildly, were notparticularly easy or straightforward in that Æon.The Path became less cluttered when I ÆS arrived and Anton LaVey began disposingof an enormous amount ofthe outdated and needless material still lingering from the Æon of HarWer in thecourse of his Task of expoundingIndulgence. As any study of the Satanic Bible will show, his was a far moredirect approach to life than were those ofthe winding Crowley teachings. The philosophy of the Church of Satan was anattractive one to many a person, thrillseeker and serious student alike, but what a good number failed to see was thatits Magus, Church, and SatanicBible operated on another subtle and higher level beyond the mere “do anythingyou want” outlook. As Dr. Aquinohas said in the past, Magus LaVey would not speak as freely and definitively onthe subject of Satan as he would onother topics relevant to his Age. Although he made references to forces andvibrations and the Man Downstairswithout making the defining statement of what Satan actually was, it would be anerror to consider him anonbeliever in the god of the Satanic Age. The question of the objective realityof Set (or Satan or HarWer) mustarise at one time or another and the problem demanded a personal resolution onthe part of the Magus Anton LaVeyas surely as it does with each of us in the Temple of Set. Setians are not askedto blindly believe in Set - it is betterthat they examine all the reasons for there not being an entity called Set inorder to arrive at an intellectualconclusion that there might well be something out there and that our currentfund of knowledge is most probablycorrect regarding that which we and it call Set. Anton LaVey’s Task was to lay agroundwork that man mightincrease in nobility through the use of the Word Uttered through his lips. Nonecan turn his hand to such aresponsibility without the knowledge of the deity passing near to him. Man mightbe related to the beasts of theplanet through his organic body, but there burned in him an alien spark whichthe Magus of Satan kindled furtherthrough his Work.The Word of the Church of Satan, like its predecessor, is integral tosuccessfully carrying out an upwardRemanifestation. Also like the Word before it, the correlation can be explainedsimply and clearly. All Words arebrought forth that they might amplify man’s use of both the moment of now andthe pursuit of the future, optionsavailable to them through the Black Flame. Both Thelema and Indulgence definedcomponents which can bemagnified in an upward direction to allow for building the structure of thebeing into a self-defined and compleatbeing, Thelema being the presence of that able to set its course through thecosmos and Indulgence the meansthrough which that course can operate on a divine rather than mundaneorientation. Without the Words beforeRemanifest the principle would have nothing higher to elevate and withoutRemanifest the others would be singleevent happenings.Remanifest is far more closely allied to Xeper than to the previous Utteranceseven with its relevant bond tothose Words. It was in the Æon of Xeper that Remanifest came to be and by therules under which it exists, it cannotconflict with the Word and teachings of Ipsissimus Aquino. Its function moreproperly supplements the action ofXeper in Initiatory life through demonstrating the exponential results of thatquest. Xeper is operative as a verb inaddition to its noun status and is constantly taking place in both lesser andgreater ways. Remanifest describes thepoint at which those acts of Coming Into Being unite to focus and induce change.It is by definition as simple andclear as that.- 439 -Looking to the future is one of the very reasons that the written and spokensequence of “Xeper and Remanifest”seems so precisely correct to me. Initiates Come Into Being and then havingreached that new state of being,Remanifest all that they have Become through the newly realized powers at theirdisposal. This leads to furtherexplorations of the universes with those sharpened skills and new Xeper s whichin turn bring about newpossibilities to Remanifest ad infinitum. These new beings produced by theprocess will eventually uncover newWords and as I have commented in the past, upcoming principles are areas ofintense curiosity on my part. It ishighly likely given our present rate of evolution that they will emerge and tryas I may to perceive the future, thosesecrets are hidden from me. It is right, proper, and logical that it should beso. Æon-enhancing Magi in years tocome will feel precisely as I do, that their Words should be linked with Xeper.Although the “Xeper and Remanifest”sequence is the most embracing elucidation of the Formula at the time of thiswriting, other Magi will make theFormula even more patent and understandable. They will themselves undertaketheir Tasks from the basis of newUnderstandings highly relevant to the Magical Current of the day and willproclaim their bonds with Xeper. Fromthis you can see the reasoning behind summarizing the Formula as Xeper andRemanifest.The Temple has not disappointed my expectations for the Word. Initiates haveread the material available, givenfeedback and criticism, and tested the proposition for validity in their ownlives. No Magus can successfully carryout his Task with an iron hand. He can share his understanding with othersinsofar as his communication skills andattention span will allow and then hope for the best. That, Setians, is what theatmosphere of the Temple of Set is:the best, most exacting, and fertile of environments for the development ofimplements to aid the reason for theTemple’s presence - the evolution of man into the divine.Xeper and Remanifest.- 440 -A89: Runa- by Stephen E. Flowers V°October 1990Runa is that which is hidden, perpetually beyond the grasp of the intellect. Byattaining to levels ofUnderstanding of what was previously hidden, we push back the barriers and inthe process create even greatermysteries beyond. This process is clear in science as well as art.As I Understand the current constellation of Æonic Words (Words within the Æon),Xeper is the process ofevolution of Self in the quest for the elusive Graal/Walhalla ( Xem), themechanism is Remanifestation, the mapis Thelema, Indulgence is all with which we even gain union, and Runa is thatwhich lies outside or beyond ourdirect experience. It is the hunger for the Graal which drives the magician: thesubtle sense of the unknown and theunknowable that motivates the magician ever onward.Runa is intimately attached to the circle or ring of nature - to the ring aroundthe pentagram. It is a kind ofmagnetic ring, pulling a focus (the Self) through the Nine Angles. The pointsthemselves - even before the current ofenergy reaches them - are Runa, the energy is Thelema, the Ninth Angle/BlackFlame is Walhalla; the very processitself with all of these and yet unknown qualities is Xeper.The eternally Hidden draws us ever onward. The Hidden can sometimes beinterpreted as the Feminine or theDarkness, but essentially it is the eternally-deep core reality whichsimultaneously pushes and draws us into theUnknown.The relationship between Runa and the ring is important to the Work of the Orderof the Trapezoid with whichthe natural cosmos interacts according to the æsthetics and magical criteria ofthe Romantics. But that is the subjectof another work.Runa, therefore, is obviously an Æon-enhancing Word rather than one intended tousher in a new æon. Itsstrong historical roots also suggest that it is a strangely non-linear,omnipresent Word which weaves in and out oftime, Remanifesting according to a mysterious pattern.Runa is the Sense of the Unknown. This implies an element of subjectivity, whichwill have a different qualitydepending upon the level of Initiation of that Subject. For the non-Initiate,especially those on Paths other than theLeft-Hand, there will be the element of horror and fear which will accompany theUnknown - once the seeker hasdelved to sufficient depths of Being.In the most basic level of our experience, Runa is that Sense of the Hidden -even of the Forbidden - which hasperhaps motivated humanity more vitally than anything else. One of the greatestof all human drives is the drive touncover the hidden, to discover that which was previously unknown. This is soobvious, yet it remains somethinglargely unexplored as a Principle in and of itself. Ultimately this factor inthe human psyche is that responsible forthe actual reception of the Gift of Set: Set may have given, but some part ofthe receiver must already have beencapable of receiving the Gift in a productive way. This factor remains withhumanity, of course. Only now it ispowered with the Gift and therefore can be conscious of this drive.As distinguished from some of the other Words which have been Uttered, Runa isone that is essentiallycomprehensible by all Setians regardless of degree, because some aspect of ithas been experienced by all. Itremains, however, something which can be Understood fully and completely forwhat it is only by the Magistry.We in the Temple have rightly been very mistrustful of “mystery” and “mysticism”- anything which smacks ofthe “unclear” or “fuzzy” - because such terms have been so abused by “mystics”of the past. What they may mean by“mystery” and what I mean by Runa are two different things. Runa does not leadto obscurity; rather it is the firststep to clarity. Just as Socrates was declared the wisest man in all Hellasbecause he claimed to “know nothing” - asall knowledge begins with the assumption of ignorance - so too does claritybegin with a Sense of the Hidden. This isan eternal process: As we push back the veil of the Hidden in one field, thatvery act creates yet more fields of theUnknown beyond. In just such a way, if consciously applied, humanity exercisesthe god-like power of creation.The real function of Runa - of “mystery” - on the Left-Hand Path is the way inwhich it leads to the clarificationor objectification of subjective/inner experience.Dangers: All æonic Words carry with them inherent dangers - to their Magi morethan anyone else, but also tothe world, as they will make alterations in the fabric of the ObjectiveUniverse. The danger of Runa is to become lostin the realm of subjectivity - in the sense of mystery. Its Magus, however, isaware of this and moreover findshimself in the company of fellow Masters of the Temple who, by their very Being,guard against this danger.Runa UltimaThe ultimate Rune is the objectification or objectifying of the ultimatesubject. This would be the entry into thering of Runa and the attainment of an “omnijective” perspective. The end andmeans of this are contained in Xeper,and the notion that the end/means constitute a return (qualitative) isRemanifestation. No amount ofphilosophizing on this topic or process can make one Understand what this means.It is something which must bethe result of one’s own Initiatory level of Being coming directly to grips withthe challenge. Although the concept of- 441 -Runa can be comprehended by almost anyone and be understood by several, onlythose who have entered the Cityof the Pyramids can be said to truly Understand it.- 442 -A90: Xeper: The Eternal Word of Set- by Don Webb V°North Solstice XXXI/June 22, 1996I am a Magus of the Word Xeper (pronounced “kheffer”), an English languagecoinage expressing an Egyptianverb written as a stylized scarab and meaning “I Have Come Into Being”. ThisWord generates the Æon of Set, and isthe current form of the Eternal Word of the Prince of Darkness. To know thisWord is to know that the ultimateresponsibility for the evolution of your psyche is in your hands. It is the Wordof freedom, ecstasy, fearfulresponsibility, and the root of all magic.Xeper is the Word of worlds; it describes the process through which all worldsCome Into Being. It is a Wordthat creates a matrix into which it can be reUttered, on both personal andhistorical levels. Each reUtterance bothdestroys and re-creates the matrix into which it is Uttered or known.It is the word of cyclic dynamism, reflecting the cycle of Manifestation -->Being --> Dismanifestation -->Remanifestation. It affects those who know it as a pleasurable and clearperception of their reality, power, and willin both the objective and subjective universes.Each moment of knowing Xeper, that is to say of being in the place in your lifewhere you can say “I Have ComeInto Being!”, is a moment that Ouspensky describes as “objective consciousness”.It is from the moments ofperceiving and acting upon Xeper that the Setian begins the process of becomingan immortal, independent,powerful, and potent Essence, which affects the universes in many ways bothcasually and a-casually.An æon is a world. As human beings we are familiar with many “worlds”. We cantalk about the “world ofThomas Jefferson” or the “world of Newton”. Magical worlds are created by Words- by the verbal power of mankindto express a divine principle - which through the effect of that Utterance onthe objective universe brings about thecreation of the world. The Word serves as a gateway for the mind seeking toenter the world it defines, and the effectof an Utterance of a Word will cause many worlds to be reconfigured in order tohear it.The Æon of Set is created by the Word “Xeper”. Xeper is an Egyptian verb meaning“I Have Come Into Being”.Xeper is the experience of an individual psyche becoming aware of its ownexistence and deciding to expand andevolve that existence through its own actions. Xeper has been experienced byanyone who has decided to seekpersonal development.Awareness of Xeper usually begins with a moment of rebellion against thespiritual status quo. In this senseXeper is a “Satanic” word, and the condition that led to its re-emergence onthis Earth began in the working calledthe Church of Satan. Its properties, however, transcend and in some ways opposethat matrix. It is the nature of self-creation that it continually re-creates its matrix in the objective universe sothat the subjective universe can evolveand expand.To experience that moment of Xeper, of emergent self-divinity, one must love twothings with all of one’s heart.The first of these is freedom, because only in freedom can one take the steps[if initially only mentally] that createand limit the self. The second thing one must love is knowledge. This isn’t thesame thing as information; this atransformative Understanding of those things within us and beyond us whichdetermine who we are.The symbols of Xeper are the scarab beetle and the dawning Sun. The beetle issymbolic of self-trust and hardwork. The beetle goes through very different stages from egg to larva to pupa tobeetle. Each stage has its own work:a particular way of gathering energy and materials, particular ways oftransforming them. It senses its ownevolution and works toward it - even though the momentum of that evolution willchange its shape radically, takingit at the appropriate time into unknown worlds and new modes of being. The dawnis symbolic of the way the worldis perceived.Unlike the followers of conventional religion who possess guidebooks thatexplain the world away, the seekerafter Xeper is looking for an intensification of being so that the world may bemade intelligible in a uniquelypersonal light. In this darkling universe there are no lights save for those youcreate through your hard work, yourspiritual rebellion, your seeking after the mysteries of your own choosing. Whenthat light dawns, it will by its verynature not only give you moments of clarity about the things in your lifeclosest to you, it will likewise show you newhorizons - horizons for you and you alone to explore. This secret was knownsymbolically to the Egyptians; theyidentified their god Xepera, the Self-Created One, with Hrumachis, the god ofthe horizon. This secret was alsoknown [at a divine level] by Aleister Crowley, who predicted that the Æon ofHrumachis would surpass his own.Set, the Egyptian god of Darkness, is the divine origin of the Word. Set’s nameultimately means the “Separator”or “Isolator”. His chief enemies are the gods of stasis and mindlessness. Thefirst of these is Osiris, Death himself.Set’s slaying of Osiris has a twofold significance for the seeker of Xeper.Firstly this represents the slaying of oldthought-patterns: the dethroning of those internal gods whom we have receivedfrom society. On a second level thiswas the act by which Set, alone of all the gods of ancient Egypt, becamedeathless. The Left-Hand Path is a quest toBecome an immortal, potent, and powerful Essence.Set’s other enemy is the demon of mindless chaos, Apep. Set is said to slay thiscreature every night just beforedawn. This symbolizes overcoming self-doubt and delusion, of acting at the timesof greatest despair, or not beinglulled to sleep by the powerful self-hypnotizing engines of mankind.- 443 -Set achieves [on a divine level] this isolation from the universe so that he maysay, “Xeper” (“I Have Come IntoBeing”). Each of these breaks - the break from the dead past [by slaying Osiris]and the break from the confusedpresent [by slaying Apep] - is done for the sake of a self-determined future.One of Set’s cult titles, Set-Heh, means“God of Unending Futurity”.Set did not receive the aid of other gods in his two quests, nor does Set giveaid to those who seek to emulatethese quests on a human level. Those who struggle [like Set] with the principleof Xeper are of his Essence. Theiractions are essentially the same. Those who want to share their quests and pooltheir knowledge seek after Set’schief tool of his Æon, the Temple of Set. It is the most concentratedenvironment for the study of Xeper, both asnoun and verb. As such those who are affected by the power of their own Xeperwill seek to enhance and protect theTemple.Xeper cannot be studied as an abstract intellectual idea. It must beexperienced. One can read about justice, orone can hope for it; but to truly know justice you must bring it into being. Onecan read about Xeper, as yourinterest in secret things has brought you to do. You can hope for it. Or you canseek the solitary self-transformationthat will cause you to experience it.The Temple of Set represents a concentration of the Æon. Like Set himself itdoes not answer prayers, and by itsvery Being provides challenges for those who would seek after the Word of Xeper.It is the embodiment of theEmerald Dawn envisioned by a German LHP order, the Fraternitas Saturni.We are not necessarily a “Satanic” order, save that we Understand that forinitiation on the Left-Hand Path tobe effective for those who have just begun Work on that path, the antinomianaspect of the work does need to befulfilled by some means. The imagery of the Black Arts provides that need formany, but it likewise can be limitingas it is mastered. Our predecessor was caught by this trap, and we hope byexploring the manifestations of theprinciple of Xeper in many cultures and times and in our own creations to havemuch further horizons. Diabolicalimagery is useful only in a culturally-bound antinomian sense; beyond this itrepresents a new stasis to bediscarded.Xeper: An Egyptian verb, like an English verb, can have several forms dependingon its number, tense, voice,and mood. You can have a verb such as “run” which can be conjugated (I run; yourun; he, she or it runs; we run; Iam running; I ran; etc.). There are about 140 forms for an English verb [Iremember this because my junior highschool Latin teacher often made us write the full conjugation of English verbswhen he was mad at us]. We happento know the tense and person of the verb Xeper from the sentence Xepera XeperXeperu. It is first person stative.Now while you’re trying to remember your high school grammar as to what tense“stative” is - you won’t. We don’thave the tense in English. It refers to a past event that modifies a currentstate. We do have first person, of course;this means that “I” did it.The proper translation of the verb Xeper is “I have Come Into Being”. There aresome implications of this whichwe in the Temple are only now beginning to consider. For instance the verbrefers to a moment that has happenedthat explains why we are here. When you write or speak or think the word“Xeper”, you are talking about somethingthat has taken place. You are not talking about something taking place at themoment of the speech-act.Xeper is not a continuous process. It is a series of events whose presence wesense either through either reasonor divine apprehension. We are aware that something has occurred to give theparticular Being we have at anymoment. We are aware that whatever the great shaping potential of that somethingwe don’t have that potential atthis moment. In short we are aware that we have had a moment wherein we acted asgods. We did something divine- we had some peak experience - we made some life-altering choice - and it hasproduced the creatures we are now.This produces two great realizations. First, we are aware that we have acapacity beyond wherever and wheneverwe are right now to both limit and create ourselves. All moments of Xeper bothlimit and create ourselves. Or to useboth of those ideas at the same time, all moments of Xeper isolate ourselvesfrom the cosmos. Second, we want to dothis again. Humankind wants the divine. In erroneous religions this desire is areturn to the divine in one way oranother [either by union or by being in the divine presence in some place withfar too much harp music]. Well, thatdoesn’t work. You can’t go back to the state where Xeper last occurred. Youcan’t go back to a previous divine stateany more than you can fold an oak back into an acorn. You can only go forward toanother divine state. If you wantto both achieve and experience your godhood, you’ve got to go forward.In our Earthly incarnation we never fully experience the divine moment. Onlythrough magical introspection dowe discover that we have passed through one and thus can say [with bothhappiness and terror] “I have Come IntoBeing”. In the Bremmer-Rhind Papyrus this idea is reflected in the fact thatXepera’s first two children are Shu(Reason) and Tefnut (Peak Emotions). Through these two human experiences we candetect the divine, and havingdetected it learn to work with it to have more divine experiences.The first question is: How do I have more divine experiences? Xeper happens toevery sapient being. Mosthumans [and most of us most of the time] stumble across those experiences whichwould set up the conditionsenabling them to later say “Xeper” if they had brains large enough to hold theconcept. The experience might begoing into a drugstore to buy a malted milk and meeting the person who willbecome your spouse for the next fiftyyears. That was divine moment: It both limited and created your life. AChristian would say it was the hand of God, aHindu would invoke karma. But we know who did it: that man or woman we face inthe mirror every day.The scary thing for all humans - and in fact the reason they/we inventedreligion in the first place - is that mostdivine experiences occur blindly. So most humans either on bended knee ask somefairytale gods not to give thembad experiences, or if they’re a little braver try to influence them with magic,or try to deny them by asserting the- 444 -meaningless nature of the cosmos. But the Setian, knowing that only through suchexperiences can he or she findthe metamorphosis which our philosophy finds both achievable and desirable,seeks out the divine experience. Ican’t tell you where to find yours. If you did what I did, you would find mainlythat it didn’t work. This is due to theindividualistic nature of Xeper [remember? First person verb.].This tells you many things about Xeper the verb. It is not continuous. Allevents do not feed it equally. It is notfully under conscious control. Rather consciousness and emotion arise from it,but can and must be used to seekmore of it. This means that Xeper is not simple self-development orself-improvement, but that these things chosenrationally can create conditions wherein Xeper can occur.All sapient beings experience Xeper, but those who can name it and Understandits purpose have a much betterchance of achieving it. The paths to it are absolutely personal, but some of itsproperties (such as being fed/triggeredby peak experiences) lead to certain group functions as facilitators. It limitsyou; divine decisions always involve aroad not taken. It creates you; divine decisions always lead to much more thancan be rationally deduced. When youcan say “Xeper”, you are in some way a different person.The noun “Xeper” - that thing we speak of as “our Xeper” - is likewise anEgyptian noun. It is usually translatedinto English as “manifestation” or “the thing that happened”. The plural of thenoun is Xeperu. When we talk about“our Xeper”, we are talking about a very large thing indeed - and we usually [inour normal, sluglike mode] give verylittle thought to it. Yet if we simply become aware of Xeper, our personalmagical and philosophical horizons greatlyexpand.Many magicians in the Temple of Set take justifiable pride in the magical itemsthey create. It’s easy to see one’smagic in a necklace one makes. However as magicians what we do is to make a verylarge magical object, existing onmany levels of reality. Our entire life considered at any moment is a Xeper, amanifestation.If you can think of all the things that you’ve wrought - changes in yourmind/body complex, your recognition,your reputation: all of those things that represent what you have brought tothis Earth - as a giant talisman, thenyou’ve got a handle on Xeper the noun. Many of you may have written a Rune topull something - gold or love - outof the unmanifest. That Rune is a tiny, tiny version of the great talisman thatis your Xeper. The creation of Xeper isthe working whereby we attract what we’re going to get in this life, and thedivine memory we will have of this life.Xeper the noun is the extension of existence to a further level of being. Theseextensions can be athought which you’ve raised to a developed, conscious level from an intuition -which would represent two levels ofbeing in your subjective universe. These extensions can be what others think ofyou. The extensions are particularityevident in actions that represent a first or personal best effort at something.Hence if you really want to Xeper, conquer fear by doing something you didn’tthink you could. Or find amystery and bring it to the surface of your understanding - or better yet theunderstanding of others. Or createsomething new [the last would be an example of the verb for “create”, s’Xeper].Since Xeper exists as a noun, you can interact with the Xeper of others: You areaffected [usually blindly] by thework of past magicians, or if you have learned the art of shaping and seekingyour own Xeper first, you canconsciously work with others’ products. An excellent example of this would theWewelsburg Working.I’ll leave you with one other word for your word-hoard - the dual noun Xeperi.Egyptian nouns can be singular(one cat), dual (two cats) or plural (too many cats). The noun Xeperi can bestbe translated by “synchronicity”,although the standard translation is “miracle”. The Egyptians knew the sign ofsomething Coming Into Being wasthe meaningful coincidence. We know too - either by Shu (“What were the odds ofthat happening?”) or by Tefnut(“It sent shivers down my spine.”). The noun Xeperi shows that manifestationsare not continuous but discrete -actions at a distance - or more simply magic. Xeper has occurred when twodiscrete systems resonate with oneanother.Another form of Xeperi is that moment of communication of wordless magicalinformation with one another.The most familiar form of this is through our interactions with the Æon. Themore adept you are at seeking andshaping your own Xeper, the more you can positively interact with the Xeper ofthe Æon and help fulfill its purposeof exporting Xeper into the objective universe.Think about these things. Think about them ’til that shiver runs down your back.Then put this aside for awhile,and come back to it. Then after the most personal and individual ofexperimentation, you too can know and heed theLaw: Xepera Xeper Xeperu = “I have Come Into Being, and by the process of myComing Into Being the process ofComing Into Being is established.”I will speak on the Word’s history, and I will ask you all to think on thisevolution in the objective universe, andthen upon the evolution of your own subjective universe: how you, the reader,have experienced Xeper. With eachevolution of the Word, note how it doesn’t lose meaning, but gains through eachhistorical test - just as Xeper inyourself gains as you gain new being.The formula Xepera Xeper Xeperu has been traced by French Egyptologists back tothe First IntermediatePeriod. There it was a formula of power for finding meaning when the divinekingship, the most important source oforder, had collapsed. This was probably the birth of the Left-Hand Path - theidea that meaning can only come fromthe individual. Xeper was the last fortress - the mind and body of theindividual. Xeper was the word of anyone whowould not let the divine principle of isolation and evolution fail.The second appearance was in Rameses III’s time. The formula was used to empowertravelers through thedesert. Xeper was a touchstone for those who extend existence by passingboundaries. Xeper was the word of theextender of Egypt - of the known order.- 445 -The third appearance was at the beginning of the Hermetic tradition. Xeperbecame the word of the individualmagician seeking two types of power: power to see through the illusions of thisworld, and power for a coherentafterlife. These practitioners began a magical practice that went beyond thestate goals of Egypt, Greece, or Rome.The fourth appearance - connected with the study of Budge’s Egyptian Language bya Priest of Mendes - wasvery different. The Left-Hand Path was up and running. The Word worked on amatrix of its own making. MichaelAquino had to find the Word (cast in Roman and Greek letters) in a translationfrom its last appearance. He didn’twrite the Rhind Papyrus, any more than its author came up with the spell ofcontinuous re-creation. But hisUtterance of that Word - in a matrix conditioned by its last appearance -produced a new access to energy and powerbeyond any previous Utterances.Aquino’s Utterance in 1975 CE was the Utterance of the Word of the Æon, definingthe process that each sapientbeing must experience in order to undergo evolution of the self. Xeper is theconcept upon which the cycles ofmanifestation are actualized [in both the noumenological and phenomenologicalworlds]. The actual activity ofcyclical dynamism is generated by the formula of Xepera Xeper Xeperu, and myRemanifestation of the Word withmy own Utterance of Xeper on the Spring Equinox of 1996 CE will raise and attunethe imagination of the world to anew and permanent understanding of the principle.My Utterance of the Word is in the tradition of Michael Aquino’s. I am Utteringthe Word into a matrix of itsown conditioning. The results should be stronger and further-reaching thanMichael Aquino’s Utterance - just as theone who follows me may extend the Word further.Each pharaoh attempted to extend the borders of the country further than hispredecessor. I am extending thepossibilities for Xeper further than Michael Aquino. My accomplishments will beless; the time of seeing an æonbeing born is very rare. My job will be to find and articulate more of theproperties of Xeper so that each student ofthe Black Arts will have new types of tools for collaboration with Set.If I manage to extend the boundaries and make there my Oath of Truth, then Iwill be seen as a successfulMagus. If I fail, others will Utter Xeper, just as mankind has been doing forthe last four thousand years. It is the jobof the Temple to keep the connections of the Word alive, so that long periods ofignorance come not again. If we failutterly, then the Word will not be heard on this Earth again.The beginning work of the Setian is to learn the formula Xepera Xeper Xeperu,which is rendered in English as“I have Come Into Being, and by the process of my Coming Into Being the processof Coming Into Being isestablished.”. Learn the formula not as a mantra but in order to see its effectsin your life. Learn to see your Xeper asthe one truth that separates you from the mass of delusions that we create inour minds so that we might sleep-walkthrough existence. Having learned to awaken to the reality of Xeper, learn toask yourself where you wish to steer -“What do I want to do?” “What do I want to Become?” - and then act accordinglywhile keeping that divinerealization fresh in your mind and soul.To those who dare the Black Magic, who will take up the uniquely personalchallenge of Xeper, as both aspiritual quest for self-deification and a psychological exploration ofantinomianism, I send greetings and the sureknowledge that when you think of Set, he thinks of you.Xeper- 446 -A91: Essent into Essence- by Robert W. Robinson V°December 29, 1996Since 1986 the magical concept of Essent into Essence has slowly evolved andtaken shape as a tool forenhancing initiation. In 1991 it took root within the Temple of Set’s Order ofthe Sepulcher of the Obsidian Masque.On April 19, 1996 (XXXI ÆS), when I was confirmed as the sixth Magus of the Æonof Set by the Council of Nine,Essent became the fifth Word of the Æon to be Recognized for its Æon-enhancingqualities.Assorted aspects of this formula have come into being on an irregular basis andas a result of personal initiation,the influence of members of the OSOM who have decided to make Essent a part oftheir own initiation, as a directresult of the effects of Dromenon performed at conclaves, and through my effortsto answer questions on Essentposed by interested Initiates of all degrees.From the beginning Essent into Essence dealt with the process of experiencingessence - merging with andactivating the eternal potential that lies at the core of all sentient beings.Essence is our “first form” - the unnaturalaspect of our being that extends beyond body and brain and is unlimited by timeand space. We experience essencewhen our activities are directed by a system of philosophical inquiry andenlightenment of the self based on directknowledge and experience of being.Essent into Essence is a magical formula, a “Key”, consisting of several“facets” which facilitate therealization of the highest levels of being or essence. All Essent intoEssence-oriented processes require a pre-existent qualitative level of life/being before the process can he triggered andfully activated. The goal of all suchprocesses is the enhancement of life/being in increasingly more focused ways.Simply stated, Essent = being. ThatEssent into Essence can be reduced to such a simple formula is a measure of itseffectiveness and validity ininitiatory pursuits focused on the realization of being as it manifests momentto moment.Essent into Essence is the journey toward, as well as the manifestation of theself in the immediate present.In Platonic terms, it is the process of an intensification of the nœticexperience of self-realization, of being - theabsolute surety that “I am an existential singularity”. It is both process andproduct, direction and destination.Essent into Essence is also the “embodiment of essence” which is the consequenceof “coming into being”. It isthe relentless continuation of existence, of being, at its most intense and mostresponsible.Although free from the restriction placed on corporeal form, I have come torealize that essence is finite[meaning that at some time in the distant future individual essence ceases], andthat by being finite it becomesachievable. The personal magical goal of all individuals interested in knowingthemselves “essentially” and totally,should be to become, in the now, their own essence.An obvious goal in this transformation process is to complete it - achieveessence - while still in physical form.Regardless of what happens to consciousness, or how drastically our perceptionsof the Universe are altered, if westill have a body, then we are still very much connected to the natural universeand the laws that govern it. Of courseour relationship with nature will be changed dramatically and irrevocably, butit will be in no way ended.Becoming separate, becoming essence, transcends physical laws as they pertain tomind, spirit, soul, oressence. Cause and effect relationships are altered. Seeming opposites - beingand non-being, natural andunnatural, joined and isolate - are seen as aspects of the same continuum andtherefore more alike than different.“Embodying essence” initiates a kind of an alliance between the self and thecosmos - a union in which nothingof the self is lost. Consequently the essence is rarefied, intensified,energized, and the potential that has alwaysbeen there is activated - awakened. We become the cosmos of the self: equal tobut not necessarily better or morethan any other cosmos. We take on the self’s “ideal form”: that which manifestsonly once in all existence.To comprehend and achieve essence I have developed many tools, and a “Key” hasbeen formulatedsymbolizing both process and attainment. The “Key of Essent into Essence” isbroken down into nine “facets”,which are designed to open the door to an “embodiment of essence”. For acomplete breakdown of the Key, pleasesee my essay “Essent into Essence: The Key and its Facets”, available in theRuby Tablet or in a back-issue of theScroll of Set.The Key is broken down into the following facets:1. Life and being make up the first facet, because without life “process” issimply not possible. Existenceas “unembodied essence” - pure spirit - is arguable at best and is not the focusof Essent [but perhapsan eventual by-product of it]. What is of interest is the potential for“embodied essence”, and this is thegoal of all efforts of Essent into Essence.The dual symbol of Ankh-W3S ideally articulates the kind of life that is thefocus of Essent. It is lifein which choices have been made to dominate, control, educate, empower,embolden, and initiate theself.2. Death or non-being, the second facet of the Key, can be either a transitorystage occurring at varioustimes during life, or it can be a permanent state out of which nothing everarises.- 447 -On the Key-diagram, this state is symbolized by the Djed scepter of the ancientEgyptians, whichsymbolizes in its various guises stability, the “world column”, transformation,resurrection, rebirth, orRemanifestation that occurs when some kind of confrontation with death (real,metaphorical, ormetaphysical) has been successfully survived.Non-being also incorporates the idea of sacrificing aspects of the self that aredetrimental, non-productive, inhibiting, and non-essential to the process of realizing essence.In this light, magicalinitiation can be thought of as the death of all that is not of the self - thatwhich simply doesn’t work.3. Love is the third facet, and is symbolized by the two-pronged fork at the endof the Key - that whichfirst enters the lock that allows us to open and shut the door to essence. TheLeft-Hand Path/Setianexperience of love in its purest form is Platonic in nature, and can be definedas the desire tocomprehend a thing in all its “thingness”, or to know a thing as it is and notas the perceiver wishes it tobe.4. Fear, and its use as an initiatory tool, is the focus of this facet of theKey. Facing and dealing with fearprovides an opportunity for dealing with fear while not demanding that it beconquered or destroyed. Ifall fear were somehow magically destroyed, which is unlikely, the destruction ofthe self would mostlikely follow. Fear is not - and never should be - thought of as the enemy.As an accomplice, however, fear can be a very efficient and powerful tool whichcan help us avoidsome very stupid mistakes. Using the Key as a frame of reference, we can willourselves to deal with fearby learning how to dominate, focus, and control it. When one can see thepositive, constructive, andcreative role fear often plays in life, it becomes nothing more and nothing lessthan it is: a means foridentifying potentially dangerous situations and a tool for dealing with them.5. Immersion, the fifth facet of the Key, means “to absorb oneself in one thing,being, or idea, to theexclusion of all others”. An implied aspect of “immersion” as it relates toEssent is the examination of aproduct of Xeper [or Xeper itself], an insight, or truth, by taking it into theself to the point that itbecomes part of one’s life. It also describes the potential for an explorationinto something to a degreewhere it can be understood from within its own perspective.6. Embodied essence, as a facet of the Key, describes essence as an obtainableand achievable goal.Each time we successfully utilize the process in our efforts to gain insightinto the self, we touchessence. A primary goal of these encounters is to sustain them.7. Spontaneity became a facet of the Key as a direct result of Dromenonpresented at conclaves in whichwe demonstrated the link between spontaneity and creativity, and how thisawareness can positivelyenhance our explorations and facilitate an eventual embodiment of essence.8. Self-examination/re-examination recalls Plato’s suggestion that theunexamined life has not beenlived to its fullest. The initiatory life-style, by its very nature, isdedicated to an examination and analysisof existence. It is a mistake to assume that this inquiry should only be focusedoutside the self. Theworld can teach us a great deal about being, but the full answer to the question“Who am I?” can only befound within.9. Energy is fundamental in the exploration of Essent into Essence. Essent ispurposeful anddemands direction. It is driven by an immensely powerful energy source which isactivated only throughneed, desire, or willed intent. Consequently in a paradigm governed by Essentinto Essence, the aimis to develop new, or re-think already extant methodologies and practices inwhich one can directly tapinto the energy that makes up and sustains essence.Essent deals with an internal flow of energy which can be used for any processleading to enhanced being andeventual godhood. The energy itself is neutral; intent is everything.To finalize: Essent = being, and being is the source as well as the plannedactivation of the energy at the heartof all existence - the inherent urge to be.By now it should be clear that being has nothing to do with stasis. It isinstead a dynamically energetic andongoing process which occurs only in the immediate present - within thetime-frame best described as “moment-to-moment”.If you think about it, the past is static - dead except for the way our memoriescontinually resurrect it - and thefuture is but unfulfilled desire and potential. The present, however, is theonly dimension of time that we can trulyown, master, and control. The challenge is to be in a series of moments to theextent that those moments begin toencompass that which is not yet, but is destined [because we will it] to be. Thequality of the future is a directoutgrowth of the quality of the present and our work within it.- 448 -A92: The Dawn of Arkte: A New Dimension of the Gift of Set- by Lilith Aquino V°May 18, 2000The astonishing and unbelievable worship of animals by the Egyptians presentsgreat difficulties toanyone who seeks reasons for it; the priests have a secret doctrine concerningthese reasons.- Diodorus II, 86During the Order of the Vampyre Working at the Set XIV International Conclave(Sacramento, 1993), I formallyinaugurated a new Element dedicated to all the creatures with whom humanityshares this planet. As yet without aname, the Element was conceived not just to admire or appreciate or helpanimals, but more importantly to focus ontheir intelligence and dignity as sentient beings in their own right.Until that time Setians had generally assumed that the Gift of Set could bedefined as “just” the kind of highintelligence, evident through Self-awareness, unique to human beings andactivated by the Initiates among them.This new Element undertook to see whether there might be anything about ourfellow animals with a similarGift of Set “signature”. If so, then we would have discovered yet anotherdimension to the Gift, perhaps not soobvious to us as our own, but deserving of recognition nonetheless.It was characteristic of this “unknown” Element that I did not dictate a namefor it, but rather invited allinterested Setians to suggest one. I finally chose the one proposed bynewly-Recognized Magister Don Webb:“Arkte”, a later Hellenistic variation of the original Hellenic arktoi,referring to the constellations of the Great andLittle Bears.The original legend concerns a nymph, Kallisto, who gave birth to a son by Zeuswhom she named Arkas. Hera,as angered by Zeus’ extramarital dalliances as Freya would be by Odin’s lateron, changed Kallisto into a bear whileshe slept. When Arkas was about to kill the bear, whom he did not recognize ashis mother, Zeus seized hold of hisspear to save her life. While Zeus could not undo Hera’s spell, he then changedArkas into a little bear, whereuponhe instantly knew Kallisto. In order to safeguard them both against furtherdanger from Hera, Zeus thentransformed them into constellations and gave them the night sky for theireternal playground.According to their own legends, the Arcadians of ancient Greece claimed to bethe original human beings,directly descended from Arkas. Setians know Ursa Major and Ursa Minor,additionally, as sacred to Set and Anubisin ancient Egypt. “Here there be Mysteries,” it can assuredly be said,explorable in such works as Arktos: The PolarMyth (cf. Dr. Aquino’s Black Pyramid in the May 1995 Scroll of Set).I announced the then-unnamed new Element in the March XXIX issue of the Order ofthe Vampyre’sNightwing: “The purpose of this Element is the defense and protection ofanimals, and the bringing to justice ofthose who harm them in any way, including for reasons of ‘research andexperimentation’.” What the founding“Arkte Warriors” did not realize at the time was that the magical powers wewould invoke in this cause wouldquickly expand the Element far beyond its original scope.In the subsequent years the growth and work of Arkte within and beyond theTemple of Set have becomelegendary. Not only have Arkte Warriors directly acted to help and save animalsin any number of plights and crises,we have awakened and transformed something new within our Selves, discovering anew kind of friendship, bond,empathy, and destiny which we can share with our furred, feathered, or scaledcounterparts. We have learned newways of looking at the Gift of Set, to see that it can embrace other kinds ofintelligence as well as the uniquely-reflective consciousness with which we humans are familiar.Arkte has therefore come to mean much more than just sympathy for animals. Itmandates respect for them, aneed to understand them on their own terms, not ours. It envisions a Setianfuture in which there is as much a placefor them as for human Initiates, in which the great neteru such as Bast,Sekhmet, Anubis, and their fellows arerestored to their full dignity.While it has been my privilege to be the Initiate around whom this magicalconcept has coalesced and found itsidentity - I cannot overemphasize that its Truth has become possible onlythrough its reception and adoption bymany others, who through it have become great Warriors in furtherance of it. Tothis I refer with the greatest prideand appreciation for their efforts, as evidence of the continuing magicalauthority of Arkte.While there is of course the collective impact of the individual actions by themany Arkte Warriors, myselfincluded, in everything from donations and demonstrations to caregiving andadoption efforts, a recent event hasserved to highlight the Element even more: Magister James and Priestess CarmelSeverson have expanded Arktebeyond the Temple of Set as a legal entity in the mundane world, affording ArkteWarriors an additional means forcarrying on their work before the general public.Nevertheless a day does not pass without fresh news of horrors perpetratedagainst animals, often all the moreterrible because they are done as though the animals in question are merecommodities or trash - just as Arkas wasso casually willing to slay his own mother until Zeus gave him the initiatorysight of a bear himself.Thus the Work of an awakened Arkte Warrior is fraught with both great love andgreat pain. This Work issomething with which we have all become familiar these many years. It is adifficult and strenuous Working tosustain, but we have all continued to do it.- 449 -I have been asked whether there is a central magical principle underlying Arkte.I would first emphasize that theWork of this Element is not mere compassion or “kindness to dumb animals” asadvocated by traditional humaneorganizations. Rather it calls upon the initiatory capacity of humankind torealize that animal intelligence must bemeasured against its own benchmark, not ours, and that as such it goes beyondmere “instinct” to various forms ofmetaphysical awareness pertinent to each species.Beyond this new initiation into and participation in different kinds ofSelf-aware high intelligence I see a newand greater evolutionary transformation of Setians into magical beings unlimitedto their own animal species.Potentially we may recapture that esoteric bond with our animal fellows whichthe ancient Egyptian priesthoods hadattained, and which so awed Diodorus. And then we will have lifted the Gift ofSet to an entirely new level of nœsis.- 450 -A93: On the Left Hand of Religion- by Vesa Iitti III°“Karhun Hampaan Kantaja”Scroll of Set #XXV-5, October 1999In our own writings there is often mention of the Temple of Set as “a religion”.What exactly do we mean bythis? Clearly if we are a religion, we are not one in the common sense of theword.This short article focuses on the issues of what is “religion” and how theTemple of Set can be viewed as a“religious organization”. The article is not meant to be any final word on theissue; rather I intend to express what Icurrently think about the issue, and to further discussion about the subject inthe Temple.What is “religion”?Scholars of comparative religious studies have not arrived at a consensus on thequestion of what religion isduring the discipline’s 150 years of academic history. Such scholars as Otto,Eliade, James, Durkheim, Douglas, andSöderblom seem to have something substantially in common in the focus of theirwork, but still their definitions of“religion” vary considerably.Etymologically in Roman Catholicism the word “religion” is derived from theLatin word religio.In other Indo-European languages there was no word to signify “religion” beforeChristianity’s influence. Thesame can be said about Finno-Ugrian languages. Thus the word/concept of“religion” has a very limited culturalsphere of etymological and contextual origin, which creates certain difficultiesin attempting to apply it to othercultures and their “religious” aspects.There are two different etymological views concerning the word religio. Somescholars of Indo-Europeanlanguages have suggested, based on Cicero’s work De Natura Deorum, that the wordderives from verb legere,which means “to collect”. According to that view, religio means actions that areused to re-collect (re- legere)everything that is needed in order to worship gods.On the other hand Christian author Lactantius proposed the verb ligare, whichmeans “to bind”. He thoughtthat religio means a “bond” which re-binds (re- ligare) people to divinity.The ways in which the word religio has been used from classical antiquitythrough today are complex andcontradictory. Meanings of the word religio have varied in the course of historyaccording to several contexts inwhich the word has been used.Historically it is noteworthy that the concept of “religion”, in the sense wegenerally understand it today,didn’t exist before the 18th century C.E. There were, of course, “religions”throughout the world before the 18thcentury, but the way they were approached was very different from the way we inthe Western world are accustomedto thinking about “religions” in our 20th century.The concept of “religion” was formed in 18th century as a part of great socialand epistemological changes inEuropean culture. Previously humankind didn’t have in its cultures and languagesa special category of “religion” - acategory that could be conceptually separated from the rest of the culture andconsidered from a comparative,scientific, non-religious perspective.From this perspective the category of “religion” is a result of development of alanguage. The “birth” of thatcategory came from a social and cultural need to create a general concept todescribe and to differentiate Christianand non-Christian traditions, practices, and experiences of a “religious”nature.Thus “religion” is a concept that is bound to a general Western cultural systemof categories of existence. Thisculturally-bound system is the conceptual base still used to categorize thingslike “new religious movements”.This cultural background is good to remember when we consider what generally isthought to be “religious” inthe Western world, and to what cultural fabric that word is historically bound.There are several definitions of “religion” offered by scholars of comparativereligious studies. Here are justsome of them:(A) Definition via SupernaturalEdward Burnett Tylor: “It seems that it is best to use this source and to simplybase the belief inspiritual beings as a minimum definition of religion.”Sir James Frazer: “By religion I understand appeasing of and arbitration withhigher powers thanman. Those powers are believed to direct and to control the course of nature andthe life of man.With this definition religion is formed from two components, theoretical andpractical, that isbelief in powers that are higher than man and the efforts to appease and toplease them.”Anthony Wallace: “Religion is a group of rituals that are rationalized withmyths, and which areused to mobilize supernatural powers to bring or to prevent changes in the worldof man or in thenature.”- 451 -Roland Robertson: “Religion is a group of beliefs and symbols (and values thatare derived fromthose) that deal with separation between empirical and non-empirical,transcendent reality, inwhich empirical issues are subordinated to non-empirical issues.”Melford Spiro: “I define religion as institution which consists of culturallyconditioned interactionwith culturally expressed supernatural beings.”Rodney Stark & William S. Bainbridge: “There is some kind of idea aboutsupernatural being,world, or power in religions and an idea that this supernatural is active andthat it effects activitiesand situations here on earth.”(B) Definition via Sacred vs. Profane - SeparationWilliam James: “Religion ... will here signify emotions, actions and experiencesof individuals intheir solitude, as they understand themselves in relation to something that theyconsider thedivine.”Emile Durkheim: “Religion is solidary system of sacred things, that is specialand forbidden - asystem of beliefs and customs that unites all of those who believe in them as amoral unit that iscalled a church.”Nathan Soderblom: “A religious people is such that holds something as sacred.”Mircea Eliade: “Religion can still be considered as a useful term if weremember, that it does notnecessarily imply belief in god, gods, or spirits, but which refers toexperience of the sacred and isthus related to the ideas of being, meaning, and truth.”Roy Rappaport: “The term ‘religion’ refers to public discourse that includes atleast one sacredproposition and those conventional social functions, that are done according tothe discourse.‘Sacred’ is a quality of unquestionable truth that believers give to aproposition that can’t beverified.”(C) Definition via “Perennial Concern”Paul Tillich: “Religion is a state of mind where one has a sense of perennialconcern, a concernthat sets all other concerns subordinate to it and which itself includes ananswer to the questionabout the meaning of life.”Robert Bellah: “Here presented, the concept of religion - which is most generalcommonmechanism that integrifies the meaning and motivation in the system - applies toall kinds ofsystems, not only to whole society or its groups.”Clifford Geertz: “Religion is (1) a system of symbols that functions to (2)bring forth powerful,broad, and long-duration moods and motivations in human beings (3) by formingideas about thegeneral order of existence, and (4) by giving those ideas such reliable nature(5) that those moodsand motivations seem specially realistic.”Jacques Waardenburg: “We consider religion as orientation and religions asspecific systems oforientation. System of orientation helps human beings to find his way in hislife and in the worldwith certain context that gives meaning to it and which helps one to navigate init.”While all of the above definitions are interesting perspectives of thephenomenon of religion, I think they donot quite address the essence of the issue from the Setian point of view.For example, the theory of Durkheim (“religion is utterly social andcollective”) explains quite well the world’sreligions (the most popular religions) and Right-Hand Path religions andapproaches to existence in general, be theycalled “religions”, “philosophies”, “ideologies”, etc.But it doesn’t apply that well to the Left-Hand Path approach to existence, norto its concepts of “sacred” andother “religious” issues.Going a bit deeper into the “Left-Hand of religion”, I now consider whatgenerally makes human beings“religious” in the first place, or rather what is categorically a necessarycondition for a human being to be a homoreligiosus.Whether one can be defined to be a “religious” or “unreligious” person is amatter of perspective, and is alsogreatly dependent upon the social context of the traditions of thought and worldcontext into which one has grownup and learned to use. Meanings of words and concepts are not completelyindependent of time and society - like- 452 -language in general. Also those meanings vary to some degree in relation tochanges in other areas of culture andsociety.To conceptually define “religious” and “unreligious” is a philosophical andscientific problem. In everyday lifethat problem is of course solved rather easily: A “religious” person says he issuch and an “unreligious” person sayshe is not such.If religions are based on human beings’ innate tendency to create meaning andorder to one’s existence, wecan ask what qualities in human beings make some of us “religious” and some ofus not.From the point of comparative religious studies, it can be said that the samethings that create culture andhumanity create religion.If we try to conceive conditions in which religiosity could be impossible, wewould presume human being whocould not be conscious of a difference between “I” and “others”, who would notbe conscious about coming physicaldeath, and who would not be able to create visions of the future world and ofthat which would Come Into Being.Accordingly a situation where religiosity would be impossible would also beimpossible for the existence ofculture. That condition would be a “state of nature”, wherein human beings wouldnot be creatures who consciouslyrecognized borders to their existence and could manipulate the OU via differentsymbolic systems (languages). Inthat condition we would be mere brutes, having direct, instinctive responses toall external stimuli.Religions exist because humans are more or less self-conscious beings who areable to use symbolic systems toconceptualize existence and to communicate it from a perspective that isseparate from nature. As such we arebeings who create values and meanings.We do not have only mind; we also have consciousness. We do not have onlynatural needs, but also valuesand non-natural needs. We do not just act, but also have ideas about “right” and“wrong” action. We have not only apast but a history and a future. We not only see, but also recognize whethersomething is beautiful.Apparently “religious” experience is, in very general terms, a common humanexperience of “there’s more tolife than what there superficially seems to be”. It is generally an experiencethat there is some higher meaning inexistence, and that one’s self is more than mere flesh and blood and culturallyconditioned persona.In his classic work Das Heilige ( The Idea of the Holy), philosopher of religionand theologian Rudolf Ottocalled religious experience as “numinous” (from the Latin numen, meaning“dynamic, spirit-filled trans-humanenergy or force”). He described this experience as “mysterium tremendum” -experience of “something whollyother”; of profound awe, majesty, energy, and urgency that at the same timefascinates and terrifies.I think that this experience has its roots in the conscious experience of one’sseparate self.“Religion” and the Temple of SetReligions are usually certain kinds of symbolic systems that are shared by theirpractitioners and that try toact as a means between different supposed realms of existence, providing somekind of profound meaning, order,morality, and general perspective to it.Religions can generally be seen as a different kind of unconscious and distortedouter reflection of theinherent non-nature of one’s conscious self.At best Right-Hand Path religions can be quite harmless and also useful forsociety at large. But at worst theycan also be truly horrible. If we compare the way that the source of allreligions - the conscious, separate self - isapproached in Right-Hand Path religions to that of the Temple of Set’s approachto the same thing, we can’t helpbut note that if we are a religion, we are completely different from most if notall of the other religions that haveexisted and that now exist in the world.If we are talking about religion in the layman’s sense of the word, then theTemple of Set is not really areligion. We are certainly an initiatory school (or “tool”).Likewise we have a “Setian philosophy” instead of a “Setian religion” as amethodological base in our pursuitof Xeper. One might very well have “religious tones” in one’s Xeper, but a meresense of “sacred” as such is not thefocus of the Temple; instead it is clearly and more precisely an individualXeper.Magister Roger Whitaker wrote once so well about the subject of “religiousSetianism” on the Setian-l Internetmailing list that I’ll include a lengthy quote from him here:I think it is vital to distinguish religious Setians - such as myself, Balanone,Magister Kelly, and others- as particular aspects of the process of self improvement and individual growthwe call Xeper.It was as a result of my Xeper that I became a religious Setian; that is wheremy work led me. Howeverwhat constitutes the elements which manifest as this “religious understanding”for me may very well notwork for anyone else, nor ideally should it (except for those wondrous cases ofsynchronicity).There is no single path, and no sure destination where that path may lead you.The importantconsiderations: Are you experiencing Xeper? Do you continue to grow?Now you can Xeper and not be a religious Setian, but you can’t be a trulyreligious Setian withoutXeper if the term is to have any substantive meaning.Each of us follows a path of our own making; where this path inevitably leadsthe individual is indeed a grandmystery, one which constitutes the wonder, beauty, and artistry of the Left-HandPath.- 453 -It is important for Adepts II° and Setians I° to understand that religiousSetians do not expect nor desire youto join them. It is something which will or will not happen as a result of yourwork, study, and magic. It has nobearing on how far you will Xeper, for there is no organizational privilegeattached to crossing over into religiousSetianism. It is something each must decide for himself based upon individualexperience in the active process ofXeper.As a Setians we are first of all focused to Xeper - an individual processof Coming Into Being. To that end weapply rational inquiry, logic, initiatory philosophy, and magic - not prayersnor unquestionable beliefs, nor dogma,nor ready-made moral codes, nor plain sense of “sacred”.We differ from manifestations of the Right-Hand Path by asserting anindividual’s being and Becoming as thefocus of his existence, and by stressing one’s responsibility for one’s actionsfrom that perspective.We do not pray to our Patron; instead we seek individually to practice ourPatron’s Gift of self-consciousness,and by so doing to honor both him and ourselves.The Temple of Set is legally incorporated as a “church”, which implies a“religious” organization. It ismeaningful in general terms for us as an organizational manifestation of theBlack Flame of self-consciousness, andas a school for its cultivation amidst the profane world of today.If we look at the question of religiosity more closely, the picture is of coursemore complicated.The concept of “religion” is, if not exclusively, at least very much aRight-Hand Path-saturated concept for ageneral human experience of “there’s more to life than what there superficiallyseems to be” - all the way from the“birth” of the concept’s modern meaning.General answers to this human experience are given in abundance in variousRight-Hand Path forms, inwhich the general position and value of individual human being is seen assubordinate to some more higher andpowerful being(s) of some sort and its (or their) authority, aims, and will.With this general background to theconcept of “religion”, the “Left-Hand of religion” is easily a confusingconcept.My understanding is that a Setian “religious” experience refers to an Initiate’sconscious experience of hisseparate self, of being aware of one’s conscious existence, its idea, of theborders and potential of one’s being viaone’s pursuit of Xeper.The experience includes specific sense of truth, right, beauty, nobility,sacredness, majesty, power, andmetaphysical dimensions of meaning and purpose attached to them.Members of the Priesthood have their individual experiences of Set, theirindividual interactions with thatentity being an essential part of the experience.Thus I see that Setian “religiosity” is first of all defined and experienced viaindividual experience of Xeper,not via such things as “supernatural”, “profane vs. sacred”- relation, nor“perennial concern”.If we take the above as a definition and description of Setian “religious”experience, I think we can safely saythat Setian philosophy can also be “religious” in its initiatory focus and thatwe indeed are a “religion”.I would, however, as a “religious” Setian myself, be interested to find abetter, more precise, and less taintedconcept than the Right-Hand Path-saturated term “religion” to describe theexperience from the Left-Hand Path/Setian point of view - that of Xeper.Written as a small reflection on the heart of being on the Year of theEssential.- 454 -A94: On the Pentagram of Set in Ancient Egypt- by Patty A. Hardy IV°At the Set-XIV Conclave in London I was asked if the pentagram were definitelyknown and used in ancientEgypt. I replied than state that Pythagoras had spent 22 years there and thenstarted up his Brotherhood in MagnaGræcia with the pentagram as its supreme secret and badge of recognition.Now I have archæological data. After much soul- and budget-searching, I obtainedone of Guy Brunton’s threevolumes on the Qau and Badari excavations sponsored by the British Museum.Flipping through the volume, Ifound a half-page of Old Kingdom pot marks that included two definite andunmistakable pentagrams - one cut intothe clay before firing by the potter, one scratched onto the pot by its owner.The bread pot with the potter-cutpentagram was thought to be from the IV Dynasty. Brunton remarks on “thenoteworthy pentagram used in quitedifferent ways and at different periods” in speaking of these pot marks.After that I decided to go back to Brunton’s Matmar expedition notes and found acrude pentagram among thepot marks documented there, again on a pot thought to date to the Old Kingdom.I then consulted Flinders Petrie’s Tanis expedition notes published nearly fortyyears earlier. There I foundamong the sketches of items from Defenneh near Tanis a pentagram marked on asealed vessel dated to the XXVIDynasty.So here are instances of the pentagram used to mark vessels in both Upper andLower Egypt, in both early andlate dynastic times. In all these cases the pentagram does not appear to be anornament or decorative element; itstands by itself, without apparent reference to any other mark or inscription.Since I have only three expeditionreports in my possession, and all three included an instance of a pentagram cutor scratched into pottery, it seemsevident that the pentagram was known in great antiquity. It was found not onstelæ or tomb paintings, but onpottery found in graves, suggesting that the symbol predates the strict artisticcanons and religious formulægoverning the work of scribes and artists in pharaonic Egypt - or arises fromsome tradition outside them.What has been said so far concerns figures which are unmistakably pentagrams.The five-pointed star - in itssimplest form a five-rayed asterisk - is found everywhere in Egyptianhieroglyphic inscriptions and art. One neverfinds six-pointed stars or hexagrams. A seven-pointed star is the symbol ofSeshet, who appears to be a female neterof records and site plans. She is always portrayed at the founding of newtemples and monuments, either with reed-pen and tablet in hand or assisting the king in driving the first peg that willbe used to stretch cords during thefoundation’s layout. [Using the stars of the Thigh to orient the foundation isfrequently mentioned in the text forthese scenes.]- 455 -A95: On Racial Memory- by Patty A. Hardy IV°The concept of “racial memory” has acted powerfully on the imaginations of thosewho watched suchpresentations during our first decade. Academics once hostile to any hint of“outer mysteries” have admitted to theirranks a new field, Cognitive Science, devoted to the Gift. Thismultidisciplinary field arose in response to therealization that neither psychologists nor neurologists nor computer scientistsnor evolutionary biologists couldindependently hope to fathom the complexity of the human mind.It is a fledgling field, but one that I think holds promise - and of courseconcerns a topic of great significanceto us. The continuing remanifestation of the First Thought, and the ensuingdialogue with the Other present at thebirth of the First Thought, is the mystery.Have a look at Merlin Donald’s Origins of the Modern Mind as well as GeraldEdelman’s Bright Air, BrilliantFire. Both of these take the approach that the mind is a web of complexassociative chains whose creation requiresspecific topological features of the brain (or whatever - Edelman says he’s nota “carbon chauvinist”, though hemakes very clear that the mind is not algorithmic). Both attempt to explain howthis neural architecture might havearisen.The evidence presented by Donald and Edelman was of two kinds: clinicaland archæological. Study ofaphasias, specific types of impairment of language ability, has allowedneurologists to figure out that languageappears to be “spread” over two different regions of the brain. Theparietal-occipital-temporal associative area, orWernicke’s area, receives and associates information already processed inspecialized regions of the brain. It isknown to be one of the two areas where damage impairs language ability. Broca’sarea appears to be specificallyinvolved with speech itself.Among other examples, a case was presented of a person having seizure activityof an unusual kind: he lostthe ability to comprehend language for several hours at a time. During theseseizures he recognized what washappening and tended to activities that required no language comprehension; atintervals he would turn on a radioto check to see if his seizure was over! The types of activity he pursuedwithout the ability to understand languagenevertheless implied reflective and purposeful thought at a level beyond what wesee with apes.From the perspective of a cognitive scientist, it looks as if Wernicke’s areahandles temporal sequencing ofsensory feedback and voluntary motor action. From an evolutionary perspective,this is precisely the capability thatwould have developed to go from “monkey see monkey do” to self-directedlearning, emulation, intentionalrepetition, self-evaluation and eventual mastery in a human learning how toflint-knap or weave a basket or paintcave art or perform a ritual dance. None of these things require speech! Butthey do require a capacity forabstracting, reviewing and replaying. From the linguistic perspective, thiswould solve the grammar problem, thefact that human infants learn to speak without enough exposure to language toreconstruct a grammar: rules ofgrammar are being constructed, not from hearing sentences, but from abstractmodels of reality created fromexperience. From our perspective, this cascading ability to isolate elements ofexperience, pay attention to themand imbue them with meaning, evaluate them, and will change in the subsequentflow of experience is the abilityto Come Into Being.The archæological evidence involves looking at artifacts left by differentspecies of Homo andAustralopithecus, judging complexity of the actions required to produce theseartifacts, and examining fossil cranialendocasts to make some guess about the gross morphology of the brain. It appears- this is still a topic of dispute -that Australopithecus, while bigger-brained than our modern apes, shows no signof the development of Werncke’sarea that seems characteristic of Homo from Homo erectus onward.(This would also explain why apes like Koko pick up sign-language vocabulariesbut show no acquisition ofgrammar: they don’t make abstract models of experience. I’ve heard nothing toindicate that Koko finds anythingunusual about ASL, except that the cat doesn’t understand it. Compare this toHelen Keller’s electrifying account of“getting” her first sign.)- 456 -A96: On the Genetic Code and the Gift of Set-by Ronald L. Barrett II°The Scroll of Set #XIV-3, June 1988Beyond you who are the third ordering shall be those of the fourth, who shallagain come into beingby a first, to recall the high orderings of the past and to witness those of thelower orderings in theirmindless self-annihilation and labor, and to continue the exalted work of thesecond and thirdorderings.- The Sixth Part of the Word of SetSometime about a million years ago on the southern African bush there appeared amost amazing creature.Treading on two legs, and bearing stone tools in the place of sharp teeth andclaws, this being was otherwisedefenseless in his environment. Yet he was somehow able to survive while incompetition with predators such assaber-toothed tigers and hyenas the size of small horses.This small creature, the ancestor of our kind, was unlike any other that hadever roamed our planet. Hisunique characteristics stemmed from his ability to give meaning to hisperceptions and experiences, and is to thisday unprecedented in any other species. Today we carry on his legacy - and more,as we take the Gift of Set to theouter limits of Xeper and Remanifestation.It is both ironic and amazing that the most perplexing phenomena we as mankindhave encountered in the OUis the vessel of our very own SU: the human psyche. We turn our gift to look atitself, and we ask questions. How is itthat this super-entity bestowed the gift of intelligence upon a pathetic primateso long ago? And what the hell is thisdamned thing called “intelligence” anyway?I have a few ideas on the subject, and I would very much like to hear what otherInitiates “make of it”. Whatfollows is a synthesis of perspectives through three lenses: anthropology,molecular biology, and Black Magic.My approach is this: If I were the Prince of Darkness, how would I create anintelligent biological organism?Creating the creator is no simple task. But considering the entity involved, thewielding of such dark power is notonly the exception but the self-made rule. So for now let’s leave aside theissue of what the essence of intelligencereally is and concentrate on the basic mechanics of the physical transformation.Starting with an organism already possessing a degree of potential to startwith, my selected creature wouldhave to be physically capable of manifesting subjective genius into adaptiveadvantage. After all, it would hardly befair to give intelligence to a sea anenome. Higher-order primates make for goodstarting material in this regard.Their fingered hands with opposable thumbs give them the dexterity to manipulatetheir environment in subtleways. They possess a reasonably-large cranial capacity and the moststate-of-the-art brain that random mutationhas been able to provide. Additionally they live in a somewhat friendlyecological niche. Possessing few naturalenemies in the treetops of the most plentiful rain forests, they would have somechance to grow and develop beforethings started getting tough.Now on to that pesky little problem of transformation. True genius would involvean elegantly simplemechanism, one that would require minimum change to actuate maximal effect. Tomerely change the physicalstructure of the organism is completely out of the question: Even if thecreature possessed the Gift, it would not bepassed on to the next generation unless the genetic blueprint itself werechanged. In fact that is all that would haveto be changed for the ugly little critter to be able to give birth to its futuremasters. To create a new programdesigning a new species, it is simply a matter of getting into the gonad, intothe nuclei of the sex cells (sperm andova), and reprogramming the molecular blueprint of the old species. In otherwords, the way to transform an apeinto a man is to reprogram him.Reprogramming an ape into a man: In the nucleus of every cell composing everyliving organism on Earth,there is a blueprint for that entire creature contained on an enormously longmolecule known as DNA. This DNA islike a “floppy disk” containing programs (genes) that will direct theconstruction of the creature in every detail,including its brain. To make the creature intelligent, you change its mind; tochange its mind, you change its DNA.The change would not have to be a very large one. Comparisons of human andchimpanzee DNA indicate thatthey are 97% identical, yet we are quantumly different beings in terms of mentalability. Apparently a very smallchange in programming has gone a long way. How?There are known to be special kinds of genes, called regulatory genes, that cancontrol the expression of othergenes. These regulatory genes can effect amazingly different physicalmanifestations simply by turning other geneson and off in different combinations. This is why the cells composing the brain,bone, muscle, and other tissues ofyour body can perform entirely different functions using identical sets ofgenetic information. Additionally it hasbeen recently discovered that in two species of closely-related amphibians, theonly genetic difference between themlies in a set of regulatory genes controlling their adolescent development.Now I have a critter (the ape), the material I wish to change (DNA), and thekind of reprogramming I intend todo (regulatory gene). I could either change an existing regulatory gene orgenes, or add one or two of my own. Themethods for making these sorts of changes are beginning to be worked out bymolecular biologists, and are currentlybeing used for many kinds of applications in science and industry. “Cloning” isthe popular term for a collection of- 457 -techniques in which genes are spliced in various sorts of ways and inserted intoa single-celled, bacteria-likeorganism, thereby transforming it. These transformed organisms can thus bereprogrammed to become biochemicalfactories for fun and profit. The techniques are simple and have been taught tohigh school students in a singleafternoon.Humans aren’t the only creatures that can reprogram DNA. There are some verysimple “life”-forms that do itmuch better than we have been able to so far. They comprise a certain class ofviruses known as retroviruses. Theyconsist of only genetic material and an enzyme in a protein capsule. Dependingupon the virus, they can insert theirgenes into the DNA of a host cell in such a way that the once-normal cell istransformed into a virus factory. Againdepending upon the virus, this can be lethal for a whole set of cells of acertain type.Not all viruses are lethal, however, and some have made genetic changes withoutany detrimental effect on thehost. There is now some evidence for the possibility that we may contain geneswhich were the result of a retrovirusinfecting our ancestors sometime in the distant past. These genes are calledproviruses and are believed to be nolonger active. But there is no reason why they couldn’t be.Now the pieces come together in a very intriguing fashion. The model I amproposing is this: The Prince ofDarkness could well have provided the Gift in the form of a master program: aregulatory gene or genes which wouldaffect other genes. This gene would be spliced into a non-lethal retrovirus thatwould infect only the sex-cells of theancestor primate. The former species would then mate and produce the protohumanprogeny, who would then go onto reproduce themselves.Set as the master molecular biologist? At some point he would have to make aphysical alteration, as thehuman psyche would be unable to adequately express itself in an inadequatebrain. At some point physical changesare necessary, and these would have to be done in a simple but complete way.Genetic alteration can accomplishthis, given the dark genius to guide the mechanisms in a very elegant manner soas to effect the transformation withonly a small set of instructions.William S. Burroughs once said, “Language is a virus from outer space.” I amsuggesting that this may indeedbe so. What are the implications?Our genes are fossils of the past, and molecular biology is providing insightsinto our evolutionary past. Race-memory is real; it exists in the genes located in our DNA. Some of theinformation has long since changed; some ismuch the same now as it was millions of years ago.Most DNA has been thought to be “garbage” containing no real information at all.Developmental biologists,however, are changing this perception. The expression “hen’s teeth”, forinstance, has some basis in fact. Apparentlyan early ancestor of the chicken had a set of teeth. While this trait no longerexists in the modern bird, chickenfetuses have been induced to grow some tooth tissue using some specialgene-activating factors. This experimenthas demonstrated that a creature can contain remnants of its evolutionary pastin the form of genes that have longsince been deactivated yet are nevertheless hanging around.If Set left a genetic fingerprint of his handiwork, it would be very difficultto find. Human DNA contains about6 billion bits of information coding for an estimated 100,000 genes in a4-character language. That is a lot ofinformation. Currently there is a major project ongoing to sequence all of thehuman DNA. We will soon have thecomplete set of instructions for construction of an entire human being. Thisinformation will mean very little to us atthe moment, but will be progressively more useful in the future. [Ed. Note: Aswe go to press, I understand thatfundamentalist religious and some ethnic groups are pressuring Congress tosuppress this DNA-deciphering effort.The stated grounds are concern for “genetic mutations out of control”, but itdoesn’t take much imagination to seewhat’s really behind the effort.]If the Gift is contained on the DNA, we will have that also. We will be able toplay with it and manipulate it.We will be able to affect our evolution in a very direct way - to program ourbiological future. We’ll be able to do thiseven if we don’t find such a gene; we’re starting to already.Given this information, there is much to be considered by the Black Magician.Following are some sampleideas and scenarios:1. Up to this time I have mentioned only the known intelligence of the humanrace. What of the possibility ofother creatures receiving the Gift? Dolphins appear to be good candidates forsuch an occurrence. Could they havedeveloped their intelligence in a more subjective context, not needing to do thekind of environmental manipulationrequired of humans on land?2. Suppose the Gift is a set of multiple genes, with one of them yet to beactivated - waiting for a human handto turn it on? [Ed. Note: In effect a genetic version of 2001: A Space Odyssey.]3. Suppose the Gift consisted of only one gene, and that it was a piece of DNAcontaining exactly 666 bits ofinformation? This is not outside the range of a small gene. Suppose the“waiting” gene discussed in #2 abovepossesses this characteristic?4. The revolution in molecular biology is providing tremendous applications inbiological warfare. While theUnited States and the Soviet Union have agreed not to produce offensivebiological weapons, they are currentlyengaged in research having to do with “defensive scenarios”. Since a “defensivescenario” requires a weapon againstwhich to defend, we are currently producing real weapons for these “what if”situations. There are plans to build atest-chamber in Utah.5. The cold war may be the least of our worries. Unlike nuclear technology, boththe information and the toolsare readily accessible in biotechnology. Remember the stories about collegestudents designing and building their- 458 -own nuclear devices? In the near future we may have the doomsday capability inour hands without the lack of“plutonium” to prevent someone from implementing it. I’m talking not just aboutsmall governments and terroristgroups, but also about individuals.- 459 -A97: On Natural vs. Non-Natural Religion- by Stephen E. Flowers V°We live in an age heavily influenced by the ideals of Romanticism. In this ageto say that something is“natural” is to equate it with something “good, right, and moral” - so saith theGospel According to the Cereal Box (acontemporary American icon). For the most part this emphasis on the natural hasbeen a positive development, andhas been used as the chief battering-ram against the edifices of monotheistictotalitarianism. But this can beconsidered only a provisional weapon in the fight to return to a more spiritualheritage. It seems that “MotherNature” can be fairly easily substituted for “God the Father” - so easily, infact, that we might suspect that “MotherNature” is none other than “God the Father” in drag.Before we go on, two important concepts must be defined and their synonymsexplained. Natural indicatesthat which is the product of regularly-occurring organic or mechanical processesin the Objective Universe (OU). Itmight be worth pointing out that the word natur-al is derived from the pastparticiple of the Latin verb nasci (to beborn). 139 So too are all of the words using this stem, i.e. nat-ion (peoplesharing ancestors). All of these originallyhave to do with organic or physical relationships.Many systems of thought have had no trouble distinguishing between the naturaland the non-natural. Theancient Greeks knew well the difference between physis (nature) and psyche(spirit). Modern German academicfaculties have no problem drawing the distinction between the Natural Sciencesand the Intellectual Sciences (whichwe call the “Humanities”).The Right-Hand Path (RHP) essentially teaches that these two categories areillusions, and that in reality thetwo are identical. Its solution is to subordinate the “illusion” ofself-awareness, of the psyche, to the “reality” of God,Nature, or whatever.The Left-Hand Path (LHP) solution is simpler. It teaches that the two categorieswe are capable of perceivingas being distinct are in fact just that. The distinction is the result of theexistence of the principle of isolateconsciousness within the universe, and the presence of the Gift of thatIntelligence within individual members of thehuman species. The LHP solution is then to cultivate and nurture thisintelligence as a separate and unique quality,that it may Xeper. Xeper leads to individually-determined freedom.In the history of religion and philosophy, we have seen many examples of hownatural and non-naturalsystems can harmoniously interact with one another. In Japan, for example, wesee how the native or ancestralreligion of Shinto has been supplemented by the introduction of the sometimesnon-natural [and certainly non-native] Buddhism. The typical Japanese is today both Shinto and Buddhist. Eachsystem fulfills a special function inthe religious life, and provides a special set of religious options to themodern Japanese. Shinto puts a person intouch with the collective, eternal life-force and vitality coursing through thenation, while Buddhism provides amethod of individual enlightenment - which may emerge on either the RHP or theLHP.The same thing can be seen in the philosophy of Plato. He did not think that allpeople should be trained inthe fashion of his Philosopher-Kings. The traditions of the belief in the godsand goddesses of the Helleniccivilization were to be cultivated and continued; but beyond this there was tobe a system of philosophical inquiryand enlightenment of the self based on direct knowledge of the objective Forms (nœsis). This nœsis, however, is anon-natural step for humans to take.Both natural and non-natural religions or philosophical systems can and docoexist in single cultures orsocieties. Each supports the other. This achieves the Platonic ideal of a wholeand evolving society.Such coexistence is not possible in a truly Christian world. Christianityreduces the non-natural to a natural ororganic/mechanical model [whether Christians appreciate this or not], andfalsely elevates that model to the level of“super-nature”. 140 There is really nothing “super-natural” about Yahweh; he is,as the Gnostics well knew, merely apersonification of the natural/organic laws.Natural religious systems are most effective for organizing and maintainingnatural structures in society, inthe OU, and within those segments of the Subjective Universe (SU) of thebeliever which still may be dependent onorganic models. On the other hand, non-natural systems are most effective forthe understanding and consciousdevelopment of the Self, which in turn may have an effect on the SU and OUthemselves.These are the most effective uses of the two systems. But as Black Magicians wemust always return to theagent of any usage - to the user - for our ultimate perspective.139 And, apparently, further back from the ancient Egyptian neter (a Form orFirst Principle = a “god” or “goddess” of theUniversal existence). - M.A.140 According to Thomas Aquinas, natural law embraces all universal phenomena,humanity included, save for revealedinstructions of God to the human consciousness ( divine law). Only God himselfwas, as the source of eternal law, exempt fromthese “proclaimed” ordering of things. The self-consciousness of mankind, to theextent that it obeys the divine and natural lawof God in the issuance of human law, is dutiful and acceptable. The presumptionof that self-consciousness to the prerogatives ofeternal law itself - as the Black Magician does - is “sinful” - the “crime” ofAdam & Eve in the Garden of Eden, as it were. - M.Aquino- 460 -The philosophy of the Temple of Set is not a natural religion; it is essentiallya non-natural one. It is perhapsthe most sophisticated and self-conscious exponent of this point of view thathistory has yet seen.When outsiders hear of some of the “non-natural” rhetoric employed in Setiandiscourse, they sometimesthink that Setians advocate the wanton destruction of nature. Nothing could befurther from the truth. Just becauseSetians are capable of going beyond nature does not imply that we find ituseless or in any way hateful.Just because a person is capable of thought does not mean that he or she willcease such natural activities asfeeling, eating, or having sex. The individual, however, may turn theseactivities into thought-provokingexperiences. In transforming natural functions into spiritual experiences,humans exercise their non-naturalprerogative to go beyond the bounds of organic existence. In going beyond thebounds of nature, the human doesnot come merely to understand divinity, but rather to exercise it. That is theaim of non-natural religion."}]
