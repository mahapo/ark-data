Frank Baum had his imperiled hero Tip (thefuturePrincess Ozma) tie together two sofas, palm branches, and the stuffed head of agump (in Oz anelk-like creature) with rope and clothesline, sprinkle it with magic powder tobring it to life, andthen use it to fly away to safety. 1 Nevertheless, as evident from theimprovised haste of itsassembly, the gump was sorely wanting in ærodynamics, and only barely broughtits passengersto a landing before falling apart. Tip granted its wish to be disassembled,though the stuffed headremained alive and continued to startle bypassers with comments throughout,presumably, therest of the thirteen original Oz books.The Church of Satan, founded in 1966, was a bit like Baum’s gump. It was alsothrowntogether in improvised haste from a variety of vaguely- or unrelated conceptsand then used totransport its riders on an unpredictably soaring, plunging, and haphazardjourney throughoutthe next nine years until its own catastrophic crash in 1975. Like the gump, itdid complete thejourney; also like the gump, it is something of an amazement that it got off theground at all,much less flew as long and as far as it did. 2 The story of this “long, strangetrip” is told in TheChurch of Satan, my companion history to The Temple of Set.I make this point because the Temple of Set, when it was founded in 1975, was anentirelydifferent phenomenon. Organizationally it had the benefit of the completeexperience of theChurch of Satan upon which to draw: to improve in part, to discard in part, andof course todisregard when building anew. Even more crucially the Temple had from itsinception a crystal-clear definition and understanding of its metaphysical authenticity and license.Its evolutionover the next quarter-century would see refinements in the organization andincreasingexploration and enhancement of the philosophy, but the original bases of bothwould neverchange.The differences between the two organizations will also be mirrored in thecontrast betweenThe Church of Satan and The Temple of Set. The former is a roller-coaster rideof alternately1 The gump was included in Walt Disney’s 1985 film Return to Oz, being acomposite of Baum’s Marvelous Land ofOz and Ozma of Oz. In this film Dorothy Gale was substituted for Tip as thegump’s creator & rider.2 Arguably its stuffed head - an Anton LaVey fan club using the Church’s name -has also remained “alive andcommenting” since the authentic Church’s 1975 conclusion.- 12 -serious, philosophical, humorous, tragic, ironic, heroic, embarrassing,frightening, and startlingpersonalities, concepts, and events. “If I hadn’t lived through it myself,” morethan one oldSatanist has remarked to me upon reading COS, “I would have found it almost toobizarre tobelieve.”The Temple of Set will not be such a rollicking reading experience, though Idaresay it will bea substantially more searching and informative one. Its purpose is first toexplain how theTemple came into being and evolved organizationally, then to summarize itsfounding/coreprinciples. Neither of these should be considered an “endgame”: The Templeconstantly changesand improves its internal design, and its philosophy also continues to berefined, improved, andcorrected as present and future Setians see the need and opportunity to do so.Certainly the initial years of the Temple were not all a smooth, steady, unifiedclimb to thestars. Both senior and junior Setians have had their flaws and failings as wellas their talents andstrengths, and as a consequence the Temple has had its share of disappointmentsalong with itssuccesses. But without exception each difficulty has been honestly confronted asa learningexperience; the result has consequently been an institution that much moresubstantial andresilient.An additional distinction between the two books is that while the former canindeed claim toembrace the entire history of the Church of Satan, this book could never hope tofulfill a similargoal with regard to the Temple of Set. The Church of Satan was a fairly simple,linear story, towhich a relatively small number of individuals made significant contributionsover a brief periodof time. The Temple of Set may be more likened to an explosion within the headsof a great manyindividuals of rich and diverse backgrounds, yielding a mix of ideas that wouldconstantly beshared, reconsidered, and compounded.The extent of this corpus of knowledge is already staggering, and of coursestill continues itsexponential growth throughout a variety of communications and records systems.Among theseare the Jeweled Tablets of Set standing reference volumes; the archives andcontinuing issues ofthe Scroll of Set newsletter; the Temple’s Internet public website and private“Intranet”; thedocuments and periodicals of the Temple’s many Orders, Elements, and Pylons;Temple andspecialized reading lists, international/regional/local conclave events, and theoverwhelmingamount of personal and interpersonal workings and dialogues involving individualSetians.When I undertook to write this Temple of Set, therefore, I knew immediately thatits focuswould need to be more a personal perspective, more an overview of what duringthe adventure ofthe Temple to date has seemed to me to be particularly notable: not just becauseof drama orcolorfulness, but because it played some necessary or crucial part in theunfolding of theadventure. It will, I think, also be my initiatory testament.As a comprehensive history, The Church of Satan can be read by anyone - Setian,Satanist, orprofane - and be expected to reasonably communicate its story in proportion tothe intelligenceof each such reader.The Temple of Set presents a somewhat different problem. While I intend thatthis book be asdirect and unambiguous as possible, Setian philosophy requires “initiatoryconsciousness” - notonly an interest in the subject matter but both the intellectual and themetaphysical capacity tocomprehend it in its ultimate sense. Within the Temple, persons possessing suchcapacity arereferred to as “Elect” and are deemed to have potential for initiation. Thoselacking it, bestintentions notwithstanding, would find the initiatory experience bewildering,frustrating, andmeaningless. Accordingly the Temple endeavors to not admit them, or todisaffiliate them assoon as possible if accidentally affiliated.It is much the same with this book. There are aspects of it that may eitherenter your mindlike flame or just leave you confused and annoyed. My pleasure in the formercase; my apologiesin the latter.[index-13_1.jpg]- 13 -The Temple of Set is divided into two main sections:I. Construction: The first is an overview of the origins and structuraldevelopment of theinstitution. While it begins in 1975, it has no timeline-cutoff, since it ismore of a conceptualmaturation than a chronicle.II. Concepts: The second is an introduction to and summary of basic Setianphilosophy andits application. It is adapted from my Black Magic, the preliminary text of theCrystal Tablet ofSet, that part of the Jeweled Tablets of Set initiatory encyclopædia provided tonew Setians Iůpon their admission to the Temple.If you are considering Setian initiation, this book may help you make yourdecision one wayor the other. If you are not, it may serve to explain and clarify the Temple ofSet to you. If itachieves these goals, it will have justified itself.Xeper.San Francisco, North Solstice L ÆS- 14 -[index-15_1.png]- 15 -"},{"pageContent":"PART I: CONSTRUCTION- 16 -[index-17_1.png]- 17 -1: The Primal ConflictThe story of the Temple of Set begins in 1966 of what archæologists, in aneffort to benonsectarian, refer to as the Common Era (CE). In that year Anton Szandor LaVeyfounded theChurch of Satan in San Francisco.LaVey, an imposing, congenial man with a carnival and circus background, had formanyyears been an enthusiastic but cynical devotee of the occult. He accumulated aunique librarycontaining many works on the more peculiar and obscure facets of human nature,together withthe major classics of traditional occultism. Disappointed with the lack ofsophistication andpractical relevance he saw in existing occult organizations, he decided that hewould have to startone of his own to remedy the problem.In the early 1960s, therefore, he began to conduct “midnight magic seminars” athis home inSan Francisco’s Richmond District. By 1965 these had coalesced into a formal“Magic Circle”.The success of this Circle prompted him to found the Church of Satan onWalpurgisnacht (April30) of 1966, which henceforth became known as the Year I Anno Satani (AS).Initially the Church remained a local organization. Group rituals were heldFriday midnights,while during the week Anton gave lectures and taught classes to aspiring Witchesand Warlocks.This fascinating and controversial organization won its share of publicityaround the countryand abroad, and soon many curious individuals were writing to San Francisco tofind out howthey too could become Satanists. In 1970 Anton published the Satanic Bible tosummarize thebasic tenets of his philosophy.The Satanic Bible did not portray Satan and his fellow dæmons as actual“supernatural”beings, but rather as symbols and metaphors for hedonistic self-indulgence.Other religions ingeneral - and Christianity in particular - were not considered to be deadlyfoes; instead they weremocked and dismissed as sanctimonious and hypocritical frauds.The Satanic Bible went on, however, to promise results from the practice ofsimplified andstandardized magical rituals. Such rites invoked Satan as well as various othergods and dæmonsfrom many mythological traditions, appealing for and/or commanding their aid incurses,seductions, cures, and the like.There was thus an oddly-inconsistent feature to the Church of Satan’sphilosophy: On onehand it professed psychodramatic atheism, while on the other it assumed theliteral existence ofdæmonic personages with the ability to hear invocations and the disposition torespond toevocations.By 1970 Anton LaVey and his wife Diane had begun to feel the strain of endlesshospitality, soa decision was made to cease most of the activities at their home in favor ofsponsoring localunits or “Grottos” of the Church elsewhere in the United States. From 1971 to1975 the Churchthus consisted of a San Francisco headquarters plus some five to ten Grottos invarious- 18 -metropolitan areas. The Church rose from an initial San Francisco membership ofabout 50 to anationwide average of about 300 through 1975. There was a turnover of perhaps30% per year,reflecting the casual, fickle attitude of many of the lower-level members.By 1973 Grottos had been organized in San Francisco, Santa Cruz/San Jose, LosAngeles,Denver, Dayton, Detroit, New York, Louisville, and Washington, D.C. Like themembership-at-large, these tended to be unstable, short-lived groups, surviving and prosperingonly as long as acharismatic Grotto Leader was in office.By 1975 Anton LaVey, having presided over nine years of mercurial individualsand Grottos,reluctantly concluded that, while the philosophy of Satanism had lost none ofits popular appeal,the Church of Satan itself was largely a failure. A small, stable nucleus ofserious and sinceredevotees had indeed developed, but for the most part the Church had served toattract merelyfad-followers, egomaniacs, and assorted oddballs whose primary interest inbecoming“Satanists” lay in being able to flash their membership cards for cocktail-partynotoriety. Antondecided that the Church might as well be converted to a vehicle for his personalfinancial benefit,hence in May of 1975 he announced a decision to sell the Satanic Priesthood andall higherdegrees for funds or objects of value.Upon founding the Church, Anton had claimed for himself the titles of HighPriest of Satanand Magus of the Age of Satan. By 1969 he had begun to ordain others to theSatanic Priesthood(the Priesthood of Mendes), and in 1970 he formalized an initiatory structure offive degrees:Satanist I°, Warlock/Witch II°, Priest/Priestess of Mendes III°, Magister IV°,and Magus V°.Advancement to the II° was based upon a fairly basic examination concerning thecontents of theSatanic Bible, but Anton was extremely strict concerning ordination to thePriesthood. Perhapstwenty individuals attained the III° between 1966 and 1975, while during thesame period Antonconferred only four IV°s - one of which upon myself.Anton’s 1975 decision to sell the degrees confounded the nucleus of sincereSatanists, myselfincluded, who saw in it a critical corruption of the very institution whoseincorruptibility andcondemnation of hypocrisy had made it so refreshing and exhilarating.Attempting to reform the Church was impossible; Anton had incorporated it underhisexclusive, personal control in 1971, a time when none of us had remotelyanticipated his 1975decision. Our only option was to leave. By mid-June 1975, therefore, virtuallythe entirenationwide Priesthood of the Church had resigned en masse. The Church of Satanas a viable,functional organization was dead, save that the LaVeys continued to use thecorporate name andimage for private gain as a “business partnership”, a status upon which theyformally agreed bycontract in 1985.In 1988 Diane [LaVey] Hegarty sued Anton to dissolve the business and divide itsassetsbetween the two of them, and this was so ordered by the San Francisco SuperiorCourt onOctober 28, 1991. Anton subsequently filed for bankruptcy for himself and theChurch of Satan,and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court so ordered, under the dissolution Chapter 7 ofU.S. bankruptcylaw, on April 29, 1993. Legally as well as essentially and organizationally,therefore, the Churchof Satan no longer exists, though continuing attempts to exploit its name mightpretendotherwise.As is detailed in The Church of Satan, three tensions and dilemmæ inherent inthatinstitution came to what might be called “critical Black Mass” by 1975. All werethe inevitable, ifinitially neither anticipated nor appreciated consequence of the Church’sincreasingsophistication as it evolved beyond old stereotypes of metaphysics and magic:(1) Was the Church of Satan theistic or atheistic?- 19 -(a) Did it believe in Satan and his fellow dæmons as actual intelligent, active,willful entities extant in time and space? Or did it disbelieve in theexistence of such beings [along with the Judæo-Christian God], and justuse them for spooky window-dressing in rituals that were merelyimaginative psychodramas?(b) In this same vein, was there perhaps a “two-tiered” attitude within theChurch, whereby its High Priest and Priesthood indeed privately believedin Satan and other dæmons, while at the same time presenting to thepublic an attitude of atheistic satire? Per this interpretation, ordinarymembers of the Church were initially/generally treated much as thepublic, yet selectively introduced to the deeper, true metaphysics as theymight show themselves capable of understanding and accepting it.(2) The original Church of Satan in San Francisco had been inaugurated, partseriously, part whimsically, by Anton Szandor LaVey in 1966 as largely apersonalvehicle for advertisement and profit, based upon his colorful personality,extensiveknowledge of the Black Arts and occultism generally, and atmospheric house inwhich to give lectures, hold meetings, and perform rituals. However, as over theyears the Church expanded beyond San Francisco, through individuals and groupshaving little or no direct exposure to these specific original allures, it begantobecome more of an impersonal institution united by common beliefs and ideas. Itsfocus was indeed Satan; Anton was revered as his High Priest and Earthly deputyonly. Correspondingly the decentralized Church behaved more like a nonprofitorganization than a profitable business.(3) The more the Church grew, and the more Anton himself became a well-knownpopular icon, the more withdrawn and private he became. In part this wasunderstandably a reaction to years of being iconized, lionized, media-exploited,andsometimes threatened. He simply became weary of it, exhausted by the demands ofhaving to constantly keep up his Mephistophelian glamor-image. Unfortunatelythis reclusiveness also extended to the Church of Satan itself beyond his old,familiar entourage in San Francisco. He gradually avoided direct contact withthemore distant membership, which had the dual consequence of forcing them to relymore on their initiative and increasing his suspicion of their uncontrolledindependence accordingly.These factors culminated first in Anton’s 1974 “Phase IV” policy paper to theChurch, inwhich the formal standing and authority of non-entourage Church officials andgroups wereweakened in favor of an informal “Movement” whose preferential membership andinfluencewould once again be Anton’s sole decision. 3 His next, and as it turned outexplosive action was toattempt to destroy the independent significance and structure of the Church’sinitiatory degreesystem, by also making both the definition and the bestowal of such titlesmerely his personalwhim. 4In terms of my personal involvement, The Church of Satan culminated with my June10, 1975letter to Anton and Diane LaVey rejecting what I regarded as their criticalcorruption of the3 Appendix #116, The Church of Satan.4 Chapter #35, The Church of Satan.- 20 -Church of Satan, and simultaneous letter to the Church membership announcing mydisavowalof the organization controlled by them. These were followed by many otherSatanists’resignations, either immediately or after waiting to see if Anton LaVey could orwould explainand/or correct his startling policy decisions and announcements.As copies of these resignations continued to pour into my mailbox, I realizedthat I was beinglooked to to provide some sort of corrective/alternative course of action.Frankly I felt both ill-qualified and ill-disposed to do this.For the past six years the Church of Satan had seemed not only unique but indeedmetaphysically sacred to me. I had never regarded it as “just an organization”alongside whichother, similar Satanic churches could just as validly exist. Correspondingly Idid not regardAnton LaVey as simply a charismatic individual or even genius, but as theanointed personaldeputy of Satan himself. I had now spoken in my Magisterial capacity to denyboth of theselegitimacies henceforth, but that was not at all the same thing as proposing topersonally replacethem.Beyond that I was grappling with intense personal shock and heartbreak. Myassociation withAnton and Diane LaVey had become almost as close as to my own parents, and quiteobviouslythe affection had been mutual. I was bitterly angry and depressed at thecircumstances whichhad now shattered this relationship. I could only hope that at some, probablydistant future timethe LaVeys might come to understand my plight and decision, and even see it asthe mostconstructive course for the legacy we had all worked so hard those many years tobuild.Nevertheless I had to begin thinking about some sort of “reformed Church ofSatan” toreplace the corrupted one. To other Satanists I referred to the concept as a“Second Church ofSatan”, although this was only a descriptive term.And of course the central question remained unanswered. If the Devil had indeedconsecrated the original Church of Satan [and its High Priest], how was I oranyone else toconclude that he would now transfer this authority to a successor Church?During my tenure in the Church I had of course practiced both Lesser and GreaterBlackMagic5 , the latter much less frequently but also on at least two occasions -the Workings of theDiabolicon and the Ninth Solstice Message - quite overwhelmingly. Yet beyond abasicconviction that there was thus something indeed to be said for GBM as atechnique, I had by andlarge not aggressively explored it. Most of my Church time had been taken upwith purely-administrative responsibilities. On the magical side of things I had indulgedmyself only inoccasional LBM experiments and some philosophical/historical/theoreticalwritings in theCloven Hoof and personal correspondence. 6In March 1975, however, after being advised of its existence by Priest RobertEthel of theWashington, D.C. Asmodeus Grotto, I tracked down a copy of Meric. Casaubon’sJohn Dee’sActions With Spirits, a 1659 facsimile reprint, at a little occult store in SanPedro, California. Thebook looked just like every magician wants a grimoire to look: big, thick,heavy, and leather-bound. I could hardly wait to “take the original Keys out for a test drive”, anddid so that veryevening at one of the old artillery batteries at Fort MacArthur where I hadconducted many a Callto Cthulhu during Army Reserve weekends with the infamous 306th PsychologicalOperations5 Lesser Black Magic (LBM) is the influencing of beings, processes, or objectsin the Objective Universe (OU) bythe application of obscure physical or behavioral laws. Greater Black Magic(GBM) is the causing of change tooccur in the Subjective Universe (SU) in accordance with the will. This changein the SU may cause a similar andproportionate change in the OU. GBM involves the summoning of both intensivelyrational ( dianoia) andconsequently intuitive ( nœsis) concentration of thought. Part II contains adetailed discussion of these concepts.6 This is fairly extensively documented in The Church of Satan.- 21 -Battalion. 7 The result was nothing short of astonishing. The following day,March 9th, I jotteddown the results:For the first Working I decided to pronounce the 19th Key, invoking ZIM (the13th Æthyr).Cornu required twice before any response.Then the result: I recall coming, under hazy circumstances, to a largewooden-beamed hall inwhich were seated a number of men around a table. I knew them to be the “SecretChiefs” of the“White” tradition of whom Aleister Crowley and others have spoken.I suggested that I might be allowed to join them, sensing that they did notimmediatelyperceive my identity as a Magister Templi of the Left-Hand Path. But there wassome dissent, asthough some of them were wary of me.Finally I revealed myself as a Magister Templi. They reacted more negativelythan before,donning robes of various colors. I responded by donning my own black/blue robe,whereuponthere was a reaction by them of even stronger dislike. I responded with anger inturn.There was a violent conflagration, the hall collapsed, and I recall nothingfurther. 8This was no mere dream; it was a rational experience, perfectly clear to mynormal senses. Itwas very “crude”, but then I hardly expected anything polished to come of afirst Working with anew magical system. I drew no particular meaning from the sequence itself; whatwas significantto me was the sharpness and clarity of the entire experience - far more so thanWorkingsconducted with the Crowley Keys in the Equinox or the LaVey Keys in the SatanicBible.I decided not to immediately mention this to Anton LaVey. It was hardly politicto recountsuch an experiment to the author of the Satanic Bible, at least not until I hadexplored andunderstood it better. Robert Ethel, who himself possessed a copy of the Casaubonvolume, wouldbe a more suitable correspondent. Upon returning to Santa Barbara I wrote him:In case you thought I passed right over your discovery of the Casaubon reprintmentioned inyour December letter, I did not. But it has taken me this long to locate a copy,inspect it foraccuracy, and form some preliminary conclusions concerning it.From what I have read in the book so far - coupled with results I have obtainedfrom anexperimental operation with one of the Keys - it is a tremendously powerfultext. The secret to itsproper use lies, I believe, in the disassociation of its implications fromhybrid/Cabalistic jargon.This includes the pronouncing of the Keys themselves (which, from Mathers’ timeonward, havebeen spoken per the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and not according to thesimple phoneticsimplied by each letter in the text).There are two general points to be considered. The first is that which I broughtout in the“Caucus Race” article in the Hoof, i.e. that Dee, Kelley, and Casaubon wouldhave been playingwith fire [at the stake] had they not bent over backwards to couch their textsin “good Christian”terminology. [One could say much the same for John Milton, whose Paradise Lostis an excellentexample of such lip service.]The second point is that Dee and Kelley were themselves necessarily of aJudaic/Christianeducational background. They would have been inclined to interpret extraordinarycontacts in linewith the myths and legends most familiar to them. In going through this reprintof Casaubon, Ihave attempted to evaluate each “Angelic” incident in a more empirical frame ofreference. Apattern is emerging that I find very exciting, but I must proceed further withthe correlationbefore I commit myself to conclusions. 9I had then relegated Mr. Casaubon to my bookshelf against some presumed futureleisuretime for such enjoyable explorations. I took him out just once again thatspring, to activate aGBM working recorded as The Sphinx and the Chimæra (Appendix #1).7 See Chapter #31 of The Church of Satan.8 Aquino, M.A., Working Record, Enochian Keys, March 9, 1975.9 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Robert Ethel, March 12, X/1975.- 22 -This working was quite spectacular as an experiment in formalized rational andintuitivethought. Scholarly research preceded the working; then GBM was used to overlayit withenlightened awareness. [This concept is discussed at greater length in Part II.]As the Church of Satan’s 1975 crisis began to unfold, I attempted to comprehendand addressit reasonably and practically through correspondence and discussion. But as thesituationworsened, I felt increasingly the need to seek guidance from the authority ofthe Church’s veryexistence, Satan himself. It seemed to me that if the Church were authentic -and, for thatmatter, ultimately so beyond Anton LaVey’s current representation of it asmerely his personalcreation and vehicle - the Prince of Darkness would have to step in. As thesenior Master next toAnton himself, I concluded that the responsibility to seek such a GBM resolutionfell to me.One of the distinguishing characteristics of a Master IV° [as beyond a PriestIII°] in theChurch of Satan was Familiarity with [or, as Aleister Crowley might have put it,“Knowledge andConversation of”] the essential Powers of Darkness themselves, including theirprimal energizingsource, Satan. The Priesthood of Mendes III°, by contrast, could perceive andrepresent thesePowers, but not consciously meld with them. Perhaps the most famous modernexample of thefacility of a Master in this regard is Crowley’s Liber 418: The Vision and TheVoice, in which hisown initiation at this level is recorded.I chose the night of June 21-22, X/197510 as an appropriate occasion for theworking. Thetime/events following my June 10th letter to Anton and Diane had suggested to methat anordinary solution was increasingly improbable, and that evening - as the SummerSolstice andanniversary of my own ordination to the Priesthood five years previously -seemed “traditionally”respectful. I cannot recall the date having any other significance to me at thetime than this.At midnight I was alone in my home at 302 East Calle Laureles, Santa Barbara -save only formy beloved Irish Setter, Brandy. As was my habit with GBM workings, I put aphonographrecord on the turntable and set it to endlessly repeat. I chose a selectionwhich I had never usedbefore [and, out of personal regard for the result, have never used since]:Ralph VaughanWilliams’ Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis.My altar was located in the living room of the house. I opened the working inthe traditionalSatanic Mass, then spoke aloud the First Part of the Word of Set. 11I felt an impulse to enter my study - “the Sanctum” as I nicknamed it - and withBrandycurled up at my feet, sat down at my desk and took up pen and paper. Then, overthe next fourhours, I wrote down the words of The Book of Coming Forth by Night.The experience was neither one of “dictation” [as in Aleister Crowley’s Book ofthe Lawworking] or of “automatic writing” after the spiritualist fashion. The thoughts,words, phrasesseemed to me indistinct from my own, yet impressed me as both unique andnecessary, asthough no other sequence would do. Frequently I paused for a time, waiting forwhat mightoccur next. Three times I got up from the desk entirely - once to find a smallbook by WallisBudge, Egyptian Language, and leaf through it until I found the sentence thathad gnawed atme, copying its hieroglyphs into my writing; once to trace an exact copy of ascrawled passagefrom the Book of the Law into the narrative; and finally, at its apparent end,to place a smallpiece of my own artwork (which I had done sometime previously, merely on ameditative whim)as a “seal”. By about 4 AM the document was completed.10 Internally, per a passage in the Book of Coming Forth by Night, the Temple ofSet has continued to use the annualdating system which, in Roman numerals, commenced from the founding of theChurch of Satan in 1966 (as theyear I Anno Satani). However the Temple changed that “AS” to “ÆS” (for Æon ofSet) after June 22, X/1975. Forease of reference in this ebook, all years are indicated in profane (CE = CommonEra) numerals, i.e. 1975, unlessthere is a magical reason for using the ÆS system.11 See Appendices #3 and #4 for the text and discussion of the Word of Setversion of the “Enochian Keys”.[index-23_1.jpg]- 23 -2: The North Solstice X WorkingThe Greater Black Magical working record The Book of Coming Forth by Night wasnot onlya revelation to and reorientation of myself personally, but also the foundingauthority andphilosophical cornerstone of the Temple of Set. Appendix #2 contains the text ofthe working,followed by my most recent analysis and commentary concerning it in Appendix #3.In this chapter I would like to consider the phenomenon of the working per se.What was it?What sort of validity, if any, can be assigned to it? Should this be differentfor others besidesmyself? Should it be regarded as a time-specific document or as something with“timeless”relevance and application?In Chapter #1 I said that there was nothing overtly sensational, supernatural,ormelodramatic about the Book of Coming Forth by Night working. I simply sat downand wroteit. It was not dictated to me by a materialized Egyptian god, nor did the wordsburn themselvesinto the pages like the fabled Hebrew Ten Commandments. The thoughts were“comfortable”ones, comprehensible to me within my preexisting frames of reference.What, then, distinguished the Book of Coming Forth by Night from a meremeditation orexercise in creative writing? No more and no less than a sensation I had then,and convictionever since, that something beyond Michael Aquino was generating it.In his excellent work The Psychology of Anomalous Experience, Graham Reed(Professor ofPsychology at York University, Canada) surveys the many types of humanthought-experiencesbeyond the ordinary emotional or rational. “Anomalous,” he begins, “meansirregular, distorted,or unusual”. 12 He goes on to note that these classifications may be in theindividual’s ownopinion, or in that of parts or the whole of his surrounding society. While somesuch experiencesmay indeed be symptoms of various forms of mental illness, others are quiteroutinely a functionof healthy thinking and are not at all pathological.We are all familiar with AEs such as dreams/daydreams, “trick of the mind”visual/audible/conceptual illusions [as in stage magic presentations, paradoxes, distortions ofperspective, etc.],memory surprises, and déjà vu. None of these are cause for concern unless theybecomeunusually frequent or otherwise overwhelm “ordinary” thought. The area intowhich The Book ofComing Forth by Night falls, however, has to do with what Reed calls “experienceof self”. It is:... fundamental to the whole of the individual’s psychic life. It underlies,determines, and coloursall other experiences. Like other critical aspects of mind, we take it forgranted and are only awareof it when it is disturbed in some way. It is almost impossible for a person innormal health to12 Reed, Graham, The Psychology of Anomolous Experience (Boston: HoughtonMifflin, 1974), page #9.- 24 -imagine what it would feel like not to be experiencing oneself as oneself. Thisis doubtless becauseimagining, like all other mental activities, normally occurs in the context ofself-experience.Clearly the experience of self is inextricably involved in all other cognitiveactivities and statesbecause it underlies them and acts as a selector, integrator, and synthesizer.In a sense all theexperiences we care to discuss affect, or are affected by, this centralexperience. So it would bepossible to discuss it partially in terms of, for example, attention,registration, memory, thinking,or emotion. Being oneself determines how we attend and to what we pay attention.It is a productof all our stored experiences, and it determines our emotional responses. At thesame time theidea “me” is a concept, the development and range of which can be consideredlike otherconcepts. 13Reed delineates four different types of anomaly from this normal, comprehensive“me”: (1)inability to distinguish oneself from one’s environment, (2) attribution ofpersonal thoughts/imagery/actions to external forces, (3) experience of a detachment or separationof the self, and(4) concern that one’s experience of self/reality is not in fact valid.The first - the “blurring of ego boundaries” 14 - is characteristic of clinicalschizophrenia, butin a contrasting and even highly-respected sense also encompasses thedissolution of the selfinto the “higher unity” of the cosmos as, for example, in nirvana.The third - detachment or separation of the self - also takes a variety offorms, from thedream “out of the body” experience to the more elaborate, subtle, andmetaphysical concepts of“astral selves”, the Egyptian ka, the sinister Doppelgänger, and in general thesoul/mind/bodydistinction.The fourth - doubt of the experience of reality - raises the question in one’smind whether hisentire experience of being, and that which is outside it, is truthful. Mostrecently this theme wasdramatically romanced in the Matrix series of movies.As for the second, it is in many respects both the most extraordinary and themosttroublesome of the four. Here we find people who are convinced that they [orothers] have been“programmed” by the government or aliens to think or act in certain ways, fromsex slaves to“Manchurian Candidates”. Some may feel that their own thoughts are being suckedaway by“thought vampires”, or that other people or beings are able to “tune into” theirprivacy just as ona radio channel.The second type also embraces, however, metaphysical or religious experiences ofa“revelation” nature. These may range [as historically in various religions] frompossession orincarnation to prophecy, “channeling”, or simply perceiving one or more GreatTruths. Far frombeing regarded as psychopathic maniacs [although they might well have been intheir own day!],such representatives as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, the Buddha, Joan ofArc, theMahdi, and Joseph Smith are popularly regarded with superstitious awe. Theirless-successfulcompetitors throughout the ages, of course, remain recorded as only heretics,weirdoes, frauds,or madmen/women.There are two other interesting features of most “revelations”:First, as they are presumed to spring from a supernatural, all-knowing source,they are [atleast by believers] not subject to the usual sort of factual questioning oranalysis. They are to beaccepted as an act of faith. Inaccuracies or inadequacies in them are ignored orassumed to be“revealed in their truth and understanding” at some divinely-determined futuretime.Secondly, some adherents rely upon a steady stream of such manifestations tokeep thebelief-system going. Hence the series of Hebrew prophets, the visions andmiracles throughout13 Ibid., page #112.14 Cf. P. Federn, Ego Psychology and the Psychoses (NY: Basic Books, 1952).- 25 -the New Testament, and of course the “Book of Revelation” telling Christians howthe wholeshow is eventually going to climax.The Book of Coming Forth by Night fits Reed’s definition of an “experience ofself/secondtype/revelation anomaly”, but does not exhibit or depend upon the twosub-features describedabove. It has been extensively and exhaustively examined, and compared to otherperspectiveson reality, by many Setians [and nonSetians] over the decades - and again herein Appendix #3.Also it has apparently passed well the test of time as a stand-alone document,requiring neithersequel nor supplement to retain its usefulness and relevance to Setianphilosophy.Now I return to my own sensation, reaction, and opinion the morning of June 22,1975.Frankly I didn’t know what to make of the Book of Coming Forth by Night. It wascertainlynot at all what I had expected [although I hadn’t known what to expect theevening before].Obviously it contained elements of ancient Egypt, Aleister Crowley, and theChurch of Satan. Butit mingled these in what was to me an odd and unfamiliar way. In some ways itseemed ancient,in other ways futuristic. It seemed to be speaking to me personally, but also toas-yet-unidentified others. It contained cosmology, philosophy, magic, evolution,cryptography,promises, and threats. Summarily it pretty well upset my entire applecart.I did, however, have two immediate impressions: one, that it was authentic -what it claimedto be - a communication from the Egyptian god Set; two, that I myself must takeit wholly andsincerely to heart. Even today, after all these years of examination of andreflection upon theBook of Coming Forth by Night, I cannot explain or defend these convictions, butsimply recallthem.In his “Preliminary Remarks” to his Book 4, Part I, Aleister Crowley discussedat some lengththe ecstatic vision which each founder of a religion seemed at one point in hislife to experience:Finally something happens whose nature may form the subject of a furtherdiscussion later on.For the moment let it suffice to say that this consciousness of the ego and thenon-ego, the seerand the thing seen, the knower and the thing known, is blotted out.There is usually an intense light, an intense sound, and a feeling of suchoverwhelming blissthat the resources of language have been exhausted again and again in theattempt to describe it.It is an absolute knock-out blow to the mind. It is so vivd and tremendous thatthose whoexperience it are in the gravest danger of losing all sense of proportion.By its light all other events of life are as darkness. 15For me the Book of Coming Forth by Night was something like that. I might try todiscuss ittheoretically and practically with others, but beyond and beneath any and allsuch sensiblecourses of action, the thing had somehow seared me to the heart of my soul.Henceforthvisualizing existence without this as its centerpiece would be quiteinconceivable.But on the morning of June 22, I did not pursue such an ominous course ofreflection. Moreimportant to me at the time was that I had asked questions about the crisis inthe Church ofSatan, and they had been answered. It was now time to share that answer withothers, which ledin due course to the [re]founding of the Temple of Set.It later seemed to me that there might be much more to the Book of Coming Forthby Nightthan just its reading. In this, admittedly, I had the model of AleisterCrowley’s attitude towardsthe Book of the Law, which he approached as a complex puzzle to be decipheredand analyzed -and so he did, over the years and in several editions of commentaries.My first detailed examination of the Book of Coming Forth by Night was a 10-pageletter tothe Priesthood of Set III°+ on September 6, 1975. This was eventually followedby a 22-page onethe following year and a 26-page one in 1985. That was included for a time inthe Crystal Tablet15 Crowley, Aleister, Magick (Part I, 1911) (NY: Samuel Weiser, 1973), page #9.- 26 -of Set (the Setian I°/introductory volume of the Jeweled Tablets of Set), andlater was moved tothe Adept II°+ Ruby Tablet. Appendix #3 of this book marks its first [andpossibly final, at leastby me] revision since then.As mentioned at the beginning of Chapter #1, the Church of Satan had struggledfor theentire decade of its existence with the central, inevitable issue of the realityof the supernatural,or more precisely the metaphysical. The puerile myths and images of the world’sconventionalreligions we had long since dismissed as worthless nonsense - indeed, aspertaining to theirdevils and demons, the stuff for amusing, spooky psychodrama, sarcastic lampoon,andoccasionally Lesser Black Magical control of gullible minds stillpsychologically enslaved tosuperstition.Yet within carefully-crafted magical ritual environments, some Satanists hadalso sensed areality beyond that apparent to the ordinary senses. This was an entirely newand positive formof “Satanism” that had almost nothing in common with traditional “Devil worship”except thepreliminary seriousness of formal atmospheres. It was a chill that went up one’sspine whencommencing, then culminating a Black Magical working. We were not justplay-acting; we hadreally opened, or at least begun to open a door which profane humanity had onlyvaguelyimagined to exist. What we would see when we got it fully open we did not know;we only sensedthat, for all of its faults and failings, the Church of Satan had somehowmanaged to discover itskey.For me, the Book of Coming Forth by Night was the event that flung that doorwide open. Inow knew of a certainty that there was a reality beyond the four-dimensional,and that within itexisted the actual centers of consciousness which mankind had dimly imagined as“gods”.Pythagoras and Plato had come closer to them as Forms or Principles, and theancient Egyptiansclosest of all as neteru.This realization forever transformed the core of my own consciousness, ofcourse, as I’m sureit would that of anyone else undergoing the same shock. I knew now that physicalextension intime/space was merely part of a much greater whole whose Mysteries awaitedbeyond.I simultaneously realized that, as Crowley had observed in Book 4 above, such anillumination - there is no better word for it - cannot possibly be described orexplained tointellects as yet within the purely-material realm of consciousness. It would befutile, evendangerous to try, as in H.G. Wells’ famous parable of The Country of the Blind.There was, however, another aspect of the Book of Coming Forth by Night whichwas bothcommunicable and practical. It pointed the way to a unique path ofself-realization andennoblement that any suitably-intelligent individual could decide to pursue. Itwas not necessaryto comprehend its origin or ultimate implication - just its existence andavailability. The Grailwas now there to be grasped and drunk from, for any with the awareness, courage,and resolve todo so.And so it has been these thirty years hence. Many thousands of humans haveundertaken theadventure invited by the Book of Coming Forth by Night - some with more successthan others,but all, I think, awakened and energized by their encounter.There is, unfortunately, a less-pleasant side to this phenomenon. Some aspirantshave foundthemselves unprepared to step beyond a purely-conventional frame of intellectualexistence. Insuch cases the strengthening of consciousness can evoke, as in thescience-fiction film ForbiddenPlanet, “monsters of the id” capable of psychological harm to themselves orothers. As it haslearned more about such dangers over the years, the Temple of Set has endeavoredto dissuadesuch personalities from seeking initiation, or shortstopping an effort thatseems to bemiscarrying in ominous directions. I daresay this will remain one of theTemple’s moreimportant and compassionate responsibilities as long as it exists.- 27 -The Book of Coming Forth by Night was so meaningful to me that I have sinceordered mylife and philosophy by its principles. The other founders of the Temple of Setaccorded it asimilar trust and respect. Even though they had not participated in the workingitself, manyremarked, they felt that the text itself carried its own aura of authenticityand conviction. In theyears that followed, countless others have been moved by it in a similarfashion.When I accepted the Book of Coming Forth by Night, it was in a deliberate,reflective way -with a resolve to undertake the creation and care of the Temple of Set proper,and to patientlyallow history to validate or disprove any principles that the Temple mightpropose or practice.This has remained my attitude ever since that serene and sublime experience.As for the text itself, I am content to comment upon it as best I can, then letothers judge it asthey will. For me it is now, as then, a simple, beautiful, and purposefulstatement from thesentient being whom mankind has loved, hated, worshipped, cursed, praised, andreviled as thePrince of Darkness. To echo the words of G.B. Shaw in The Devil’s Disciple: “Ipromised him mysoul, and swore an oath that I would stand up for him in this world and stand byhim in thenext.”- 28 -[index-29_1.jpg][index-29_2.jpg]- 29 -3: KhemistryConfronting Ancient EgyptThe Book of Coming Forth by Night, among other things, retired the iconographyof Judæo/Christianity in favor of that of ancient Egypt. This resolved the Church ofSatan’s perennialproblem of being cast by others, if increasingly not casting itself, into animage of “anti-J/C” [and presumably the “good” values J/C claims to represent].A focus upon ancient Egyptian philosophy, religion, and culture, however,presented thefledgling Temple of Set with a different, and equally formidable array ofproblems.The topic of ancient Egypt generally has been one of both exhaustive examinationby andcontentious debate between conventional Egyptologists and independentinvestigators.The former group generally agree that Egypt was simply an agricultural societycomparableto that of other Mediterranean/Near-Eastern cultures of the time-period. It wasnotable for itsenigmatic hieroglyphic writing system, odd-looking formalized art, peculiarmassive buildingprojects, and morbid, animal-totem religious cultism.The latter group, while differing in the details, see Egypt rather as aremarkable, indeedstartling exception to its primitive neighbors. It was uniquely a civilizationand repository ofgreat sophistication and wisdom - in some respects so much so, indeed, that thevery ability ofthe Egyptians themselves to have generated such utopian wonders is called intoquestion in favorof Atlanteans, extraterrestrial visitors, and/or incarnated gods.Each camp routinely ridicules the other. The conventionalists denounce theindependents asunscientific dreamers and “pyramidiots”. The latter are equally contemptuous ofthe former,considering them as merely a brittle academic self-protectorate afraid toviolate modern taboos.And there are two taboos in particular which institutional academia does notdare totransgress - or even openly acknowledge as taboos.First, modern [Western] civilization is assumed to be at the zenith of humansophistication inall respects. It has been steadily improving over the last five thousand years(after recordedhistory officially began ca. 3000 BCE). Since the passage of time mandatessocial evolution andimprovement, it is heresy to suggest that an ancient civilization, particularlyone at the verybeginning of this progression, could actually have been superior to itssuccessors, includingthose today, in some if not all respects.Secondly, the world today is divided into three major monotheistic religions:Judaism,Christianity, and Islam. All, even in countries where they have become largelypropagandadevices for the control of the lesser-intelligent masses, are as exclusive andintolerant aspolitically permitted. Despite their doctrinal differences, however, they areall agreed that there- 30 -exists but one God - the Hebraic JHVH. Thus all polytheism, whether new or old,is false andfictitious. It follows that any such fiction cannot possibly be as, much lessmore sophisticatedthan Hebraic monotheism [as triple-modified]. Egyptian religion may be studied,exploited forartistic purposes and horror movies, but never actually believed in.The Church of Satan had been accused by its critics of championing the worshipof evil. Notso: What it actually did, as exemplified in the Diabolicon, was to maintain that“God” was in factevil and “Satan”, as a repudiation of that evil, was truly good. This was a newinterpretation of“evil” as human denial of personal responsibility for moral decisions, as wellas hypocrisy in theexecuting of such moral decisions as were ventured. True goodness wasaccordingly to be foundin genuine personal responsibility and full acceptance of the consequences ofone’s decisions.This is what made the Church of Satan, despite its bizarre facade, feel sorefreshingly virtuousnext to the repulsive, corrupt Hebraic monotheism it rejected.Now the Temple of Set was challenged to take one step beyond. The entire Hebraicmonotheism, to include even its Satanic reinterpretation as the actual benchmarkfor evil, wouldbe thrown into the dustbin. JHVH, Satan, Moses, Christ, Mohammed - collectivelydiscarded inall of their social, physical, or metaphysical contexts and pretensions.In their stead would arise not a mere revival of polytheism per se, but apolyfaceted divineindividualism, in which the energy of each such personal consciousness isrealized to derive froma Universal inspiration: Set.This was a Set far more subtle and complex than the superficial characterdescribed by theEgyptologists. Just how much so it would take the Temple of Set many years todiscover; inmany regards it is still doing so.The other Egyptian “gods” were also reperceived. In conventional Egyptology theytoo, likeSet, were merely two-dimensional dolls in a hodgepodge of folk tales andparables. Now theindividual human consciousness, each as energized by Set, was seen to be capableof seeing pastthe physical surface of natural phenomena, into the living essence underlyingeach. These are theForms described by Plato in his Dialogues, and more originally the true neterucomprehendedby the priesthoods of ancient Egypt.To the extent it has been noticed by conventional society over the years sinceits [re]founding,the Temple of Set has occasionally been maligned and attacked on variousalarmist pretexts:“Satanism”, “cult”, “political extremism”, “mind control”, etc. All suchnonsense serves merely toillustrate how ignorant such critics are of the actual distinction andsignificance of the Temple assummarized here. It is nothing less than an entirely new way of looking not justat self-conscioushumanity, but at the physical and metaphysical realities beyond that humanity,Egyptian HistoryLet us now review those aspects of ancient Egypt on which most scholars, theacademic andthe arcane, might be expected to find some common ground.The earliest existing evidence of human culture in the Nile valley dates to morethan 250,000BCE, as the remnants of hand axes and other stone tools have been uncovered50-100’ below theNile’s silt terrace.Sometime between 10,000 and 7,000 BCE, according to conventional archæology, amostimportant event took place - the domestication of the wild African goat and thesubsequentfreedom to begin cultivation of grain. This effectively heralded the beginningof humancivilization, as for the first time primitive man was free to turn his thoughtsto matters otherthan a constant search for food.By the same consensus, it was in the pre-dynastic Gerzean period (commencingabout 3600BCE) that the first communities of the future Egyptian nation came intoexistence. A great war of- 31 -unification commenced in approximately 3400 BCE. After more than two centuriesofintermittent conflict between Upper and Lower Egypt, the land was finally unitedunder Menes(or Narmer), the first pharaoh of the I Dynasty. 16Inhabiting a land characterized by the regularity of the elements (behavior ofthe winds, theNile, the climate, the Sun, and the skies), the Egyptians sought perfection instability, harmony,symmetry, geometry, and a cyclical [as opposed to progressive or linear] conceptof time.In modern culture we take progressive/linear time for granted. It is asinevitable andinexorable as the hands of the wristwatches to which we are gently, yet firmlymanacled. We seeour lives, and indeed the entire known universe, as a terrible struggle againstentropy, endingultimately in the death, decomposition, and obliteration of each separate personor thing.It is further this perception, and the fear of it, which has lent Hebraicmonotheism a vampiricpersistence far past the 17th-18th Century “Enlightenment” which, intellectuallyat least, exposedit as a sham. For the Christian and Muslim versions, if not the Jewish, promisecontinuation ofthe same life after physical death, albeit with dire punishment specifically fornot believing inand obeying them now.The Egyptians, however, envisioned neither themselves nor the world about themto beentrapped in such a fearsome forced-march. They saw the Sun, Moon, and firmamentbehavingin recurring cycles, as also the rise and fall of the Nile, the regular seasons,plant life. If humansand other animals were born, lived for a time, and died, it stood to reason thatthey tooparticipated in an eternal cycling of a more subtle color. Egyptian recordswould accordinglydocument specific personalities and events, but without any particular attentionto relatedchange or innovation. Harmony with the cycles of things, not defiance of them,was the Egyptianideal - which explains why the essential character of Egyptian society remainedlittle changed,except to meet external intrusion, for thirty dynasties extending over 3,000years. 17Former Director of Cairo’s French Oriental Archæological Institute SergeSauneroncomments:To understand the attitude of the Egyptians, it is necessary to emphasize thestriking contrastbetween their view of the world and ours. We live in a universe which we know isin perpetualmovement; each new problem demands a new solution. But for the Egyptians thisnotion of timewhich modifies the current knowledge of the world, of an alteration of factorswhich forces achange in methods, had no place. In the beginning the divinity created a stableworld, fixed,definitive; this world functions as a motor well oiled and well fed. If thereare “misfires” - if themotor fades, if one of the parts making it up is worn out or broken - it isreplaced and everythingstarts off again better than before. But this motor would always remain thesame; its mechanism,its appearance, its output would always be identical.If some problem intrigues the mind, therefore - if some serious event arises todisturb thecustomary order of things - it could not really be new; it was foreseen with theworld. Its solutionor remedy exists in all eternity, revealed in a kind of universal “manner ofuse” that the godsdefined in creating the universe itself. What is necessary, therefore, is tofind in the ancientwritings the formula that foresaw such-and-such a case. Before a given event - aphysicalphenomenon, a catastrophe striking the whole country - the scholar would notseek to discover theactual causes in order to find an appropriate remedy. Rather he would examinewith scholarlyardor the volumes of old writings to find out if the event had already occurredin some moment ofthe past, and what solution had then been applied to it. 1816 Fairservis, Walter A. Jr., The Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile. New York: NewAmerican Library/Mentor #MY-843,1962, Chapters #1-2.17 The XXX Dynasty is generally considered to be the last native Egyptian one.Subsequently there was a Persian one(XXXI) and a Ptolemaic Greek one (XXXII), ending with the death of Cleopatra VIIand Roman rule in 30 BCE.18 Sauneron, Serge, Les pretres de l’ancienne Egypte. New York: Grove Press,1980, pages #118-119.- 32 -In accordance with their cyclical perception of reality, therefore, theEgyptians’ achievementstended to be in “timeless” areas such as astronomy, mathematics, medicine, andarchitecture.These, along with Egyptian religion and art, are often oversimplified in manymoderntreatments, due in part to the absence of verifiable data in later history untilthe deciphering ofhieroglyphics by Champollion in 1822. Because of the destruction anddespoliation of ancientEgyptian records and works of art by religious fanatics of later eras, it isestimated that modernarchæologists have at their disposal less than 10% of that country’s culturalcreations from whichto reconstruct its values. 19Egypt was divided into 42 nomes (provinces), each dominated by the priesthood ofone ormore neteru. A particular priesthood might also influence more than one nome.The monarchywas closely controlled by the various orders of priesthood, with the pharaohacting as an Earthlydeputy of and interpreter for the neteru.Governmental, judicial, and political systems were responsible for their ethicsto the neteru,not to the people. Justice was meted out by viziers (internal roving ambassadorsof the pharaoh)and nome governors according to the neter of justice, Maat, on anindividual-case basis. Therewas no concept of individual rights against the government, because governmentwas viewed asa system imposed from without by the neteru. Similarly each Egyptian, whetherhigh- orlowborn, participated in this system. Crime and corruption were of coursepossible, butinadvisable because of the conviction that viciousness, callousness, or crueltywould be punishedseverely after Earthly death. 20 [It is of note that such posthumous judgmentfocused uponindividual virtue/vice rather than, as in later Christian/Islamic doctrine, uponmere orthodoxyand obedience to religious institutions.]Old Kingdom Egypt was largely insulated from foreign invasion or conflict, henceEgyptspent its early years as a peaceful culture with no standing military. Egypt iscredited withinvention of the alphabet, as well as the use of currency as a medium ofexchange. It isnoteworthy for having produced the first national (as opposed to city-state)political system, aswell as the most enduring one in recorded history (more than 3,000 years). Therewas no caste,racial, or sexual discrimination; foreigners were considered “less than human(=Egyptian)”, butcould remedy this misfortune simply by moving to Egypt and adopting Egyptianculture.Egypt was ultimately destroyed by foreign conquerors (Persia, Macedonia, Rome)and by herinability to adapt to the continuing competition of foreign cultures. Her NewEmpire of theSetian (XIX-XX) Dynasties was a protectionist backlash rather than an effort to“civilize” orcreate a permanent empire [after the fashion of Persia, Macedonia, or Rome].19 Cf. Fagan, Brian M., The Rape of the Nile. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons,1975.20 Wilson, John A., “Egypt” in Frankfort, Henri (Ed.), Before Philosophy.Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1946.[index-33_1.jpg][index-33_2.jpg][index-33_3.jpg][index-33_4.png]- 33 -The NeteruThe Egyptians perceived the Universe as actively controlled by conscious,natural principles( neteru) of which Sir E.A. Wallis Budge remarks:The word neter has been translated “godlike”, “holy”, “divine”, “sacred”,“power”, “strength”,“force”, “strong”, “fortify”, “mighty”, “protect”; but it is quite impossible tobe certain that anyword which we may use represents the meaning of neter, because no one knowsexactly what ideathe ancient Egyptians attached to the word. The truth is that the exact meaningof neter was lost ata very early period of Egyptian history, and even the Coptic does not help us torecover it. 21To the Egyptians, all of “nature” (derived from neter) was alive and the directconsequence ofthe wills of the neteru. Nature was intelligible not just through inanimate,automatic, generalregularities which could be discovered via the “scientific method”; but alsothroughconnections and associations between things and events perceived in the humanmind. There was no distinction between “reality” and “appearance”; anythingcapable ofexerting an effect upon the mind thereby existed. Hence a dream could beconsidered just as“real” and thus significant as a daytime experience. No more eloquently has thisbeensummarized than by She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed in H. Rider Haggard’s She and Allan:[Allan Quatermain] “I have heard of Isis ofthe Egyptians, Lady of the Moon, Mother ofMysteries, spouse of Osiris whose child wasHorus the Avenger.”[Ayesha] “Aye, and I think will hear moreof her before you have done, Allan, for nowsomething comes back to me concerning youand her and another. I am not the only one whohas broken the oaths of Isis and received hercurse, Allan, as you may find out in the days tocome. But what of these heavenly queens?”“Only this, Ayesha: I have been taught thatthey were but phantasms fabled by men withmany another false divinity, and could havesworn that this was true. And yet you talk ofthem as real and living, which perplexes me.”“Being dull of understanding doubtless itperplexes you, Allan. Yet if you had imagination,you might understand that these goddesses aregreat principles of nature: Isis of throned21 Budge, E. A. Wallis, The Book of the Dead. New Hyde Park: University Books,1960, page #99.- 34 -Wisdom and strait virtue, and Aphrodite of Love as it is known to men and womenwho, beinghuman, have it laid upon them that they must hand on the torch of life in theirlittle hour. Also youwould know that such principles can seem to take shape and form and at certainages of he worldappear to their servants visible in majesty, though perchance today others withchanged nameswield their sceptres and work their will. Now you are answered on this matter.”The Egyptian concept of “magic”, correspondingly, was neither unusual orexceptional. Itmerely represented the setting in motion of appropriate neteru forces toaccomplish a desiredend: which could be through physical action, symbolic ritual, art, or speech (heka). A magicaloperation thus initially required perception ( sia) of a necessity, followed byutterance of the heka( hw) to address it.Egyptian art, literature, and science looked for beauty and symmetry (felt to beindications ofdivine perfection), rather than for cause-and-effect relationships. HenceEgyptian thought issometimes called “geometric” as opposed to the “algebraic” thought of Hellenicand laterlogicians.Since impressions and appearances substantiated reality, the Egyptian emphasison portraitsand statues of the neteru was not merely decorative, metaphorical, or symbolic.Rather an imagewas a medium whereby the neter in question could make an actual appearance inthe materialworld. 22Similarly part of something could substitute for the whole as long as the mindcompleted theconnection. Mental imagery created by viewing the portrait of a dead relative,for example,brought that relative to true life.Persons unfamiliar with the ancient Egyptian culture often assume that theEgyptianreligion, like those of later Mediterranean civilizations, consisted of asingle, integrated pantheonof anthropomorphic gods and goddesses. It is rather the case that the earliestEgyptian neteruwere provincial, being patrons of individual cities and districts (nomes). Nor,despite theirfamous human/beast composite appearances, were they mere “supernatural persons”in the laterGreek, Mesopotamian, or Roman mold. While popular stories were woven about them-presumably for popular consumption - the hieroglyphic treatment of the Egyptianneterusuggests that they actually represented various aspects of existence - the“Forms” or “FirstPrinciples” discussed by Pythagoras and Plato in a more abstract manner. 23Intriguingly the neteru may have had a physical presence as well. The 30-Dynastydatingsystem most archæologists use for ancient Egypt comes from Manetho, an Egyptianpriest atSebennytos in the Nile Delta ca. 280 BCE. Manetho’s dynastic list extendsbackward beforeMenes and the I Dynasty date of 3100 BCE: 350 years Thinites; 1,790 years otherMemphitekings; 1,817 years other kings; 1,255 years “Heroes”; and before that 13,900years in which theneteru reigned physically on Earth.Obviously this chronology would conflict with the “accepted” prehistory of Egyptassummarized at the beginning of this chapter. Conventional Egyptologists arecomfortable onlywith a “civilization began suddenly in 3100 BCE” scenario, hence Manetho isrelied upon verystrongly after that date, but swept under the rug prior to it. 2422 Cf. Schaefer, Heinrich, Principles of Egyptian Art. Oxford: Clarendon Press,1974. Contrast Egyptian statuarywith Greek, Roman, or later European. The “living presence” in the former willbe dramatically evident.23 Cf. Winspear, Alban D., The Genesis of Plato’s Thought. New York: S.A.Russell, 1940. Also Cf. Aquino, M.A., “TheSphinx and the Chimæra” (Appendix #1).24 Hoffman, Michael A., Egypt Before the Pharaohs. New York: Alfred A. Knopf,1979. Fix, Wm. R., PyramidOdyssey. New York: Mayflower Books, 1978.[index-35_1.jpg][index-35_2.jpg]- 35 -Commerce, protective alliances, cultural contact, and finally the unification ofthe entirenation ca. 3100 BCE resulted in the gradual incorporation of local neteru intoregional groups,and then into a loosely-knit national pantheon. Local and regional cult centerscontinued to holdtheir respective patrons in especial regard, however, and so the character androle of a specificneter might vary remarkably from place to place. Individual dynasties alsotended to be orientedto particular cult centers, and so the neteru in question would be elevated - atleast for a time - tothe status of national patrons. 25The information concerning these cults which is available to modernEgyptologists is bothsparse and confusing. Since a given neter could be portrayed in a number ofdifferent ways,identifying the “core neter” is difficult. The images and inscriptionsconcerning a neter wereoften altered or appropriated by cultists of rival neteru. In Christian andIslamic times all “oldgods” were considered blasphemous, and monuments to them were regularly defacedanddestroyed. By the end of the fifth century CE, knowledge of hieroglyphics haddied out, not toreappear until the nineteenth century; meanwhile many “useless” records perishedthroughneglect.For two reasons the cult of Osiris ( Asar) and Isis ( Asa) has been emphasizedin modernliterature: First, it was the last cult to dominate the entire Egyptian nation.Thus it was in aposition to do a “final editing” of non-Osirian manuscripts and monuments.Secondly it wasdescribed in detail by Plutarch, permitting its study long after thehieroglyphic records of theother cults had become unreadable. 26SetNo records of the ancient Priesthood of Set survived first the Osirian-dynasticpersecutionand later the more general vandalism of the Christian/Islamic eras. We know ofit only by itsreflection, both in the character of Set as he was portrayed symbolically andmythologically andin the nature of Egyptian priesthoods in general. Three significant facts areknown about thePriesthood of Set:(1) Together with the Priesthood of Horus [the Elder], it was the oldest of theEgyptian priesthoods. If we date it to the earliest predynastic images of Setfound byarchæologists, we can establish an origin of at least 3200 BCE. Working with theEgyptians’ own25 Ions, Veronica, Egyptian Mythology.

Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, Volume V in Moralia (14volumes), F.C. Babbitt (Ed. & Trans.).London: Loeb Classical Library, 1936.- 36 -astronomically-based records, we may approximate 5000 BCE. 27 If we are toassume the finaleclipse of the Priesthood at the end of the XIX-XX [Setian] Dynasties ca. 1085BCE, we arelooking at an institution which existed at least two thousand and possibly asmany as fourthousand years. “In the early dynasties,” observes Budge:Set was a beneficent god, and one whose favor was sought after by the living andby the dead,and so late as the XIX Dynasty kings delighted to call themselves “Beloved ofSet”. After the cult ofOsiris was firmly established and this god was the “great god” of all Egypt, itbecame the fashion toregard Set as the origin of all evil, and his statues and images were soeffectively destroyed thatonly a few which have escaped by accident have come down to us. 28One may note that Set was by no means the only “fabulous” creature everportrayed byEgyptian artists. But he was the only one represented as a principal neter, asopposed to apurely-animalistic monster of the Tuat.(2) Set was the neter who was “different” from all of the others. Too often thisissimplified into his being the “evil” slayer of Osiris, hence the personificationof “evil”; yet any butthe most cursory study of Egyptian religious symbolism is sufficient to dispelthis caricature. Hewas rather a neter “against the neteru”: the entity who symbolized that which isnot of nature.This is a very curious role for a neter in Egyptian cosmology: to be a presenceand forcewhich alone could not be apprehended by perceptions of the natural senses. Setthus representsthe nameless “thing” whose existence we know of by the shadow it casts on thingsapprehendedand things perceived by it: the non-natural “presence of self” in individualintelligent life.We have generalized the vehicle by which this presence is manifest as the ba,spirit, psyche,or soul, but increased precision is possible. We must subtract from the psychewhat is “lifeforce”, and focus our attention on that which remains: the very awareness ofself. In doing sowe have in one sense retraced the path of Descartes to the cogito ergo sumproposition. UnlikeDescartes, however, we see this phenomenon to be a “thing totally apart” whichis not anextension of “God” or anything else. Set is the conceptualizer of thisprinciple: the designer. Torewrite the crucial sentence in the above quote from the point of view of aneter: “A thing createdin the mind thereby exists.”This is delicate ground to tread, so much more so for an ancient Egyptiancivilization whoseentire “natural” cosmology was based upon the perfection and harmony of theUniverse.(3) Despite this unique and disturbing image, or perhaps because of it, Setbecame the patron of the two most powerful dynasties in Egypt’s long history,theXIX and XX. Herein there is an interesting “theological succession”:The early XVIII Dynasty (ca. 1580-1372) was that of the great Amenhoteps, duringwhosereigns the Priesthood of Amon at Thebes was preeminent. The dynastydisintegrated during the“Amarna period” (ca. 1372-1343) of Akhenaten, during which the solar disk ofAton wasconsidered supreme if not indeed all-inclusive of the neteru. When the new XIXDynasty aroseunder Rameses I and Seti I, the state role of Amon was restored - but thepharaohs directedmuch of their efforts towards Set. Recounts Sauneron:The new dynasty in power, careful to appear to be “restoring everything toorder”, had manyreasons for mistrusting the Amonian priesthood. Descendants of a military familyof the easterndelta, the new pharaohs were traditionally devoted to a god little esteemed bythe masses because27 Lockyer, J. Norman, The Dawn of Astronomy. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1964, page#215.28 Budge, The Book of the Dead, page #181.- 37 -of the role that he had been assigned in the death of Osiris. But they preservednevertheless, hereand there, the temples and priesthoods of the god Set.The Amarnian experience had demonstrated the cost of too abrupt a break with thebeliefscentral to the entire nation, and of entering into open warfare against apriesthood practically aspowerful as the throne itself. Thus the politics of Seti I (1312-1301) and ofRameses II (1301-1235)were infinitely more subtle than those of their predecessors. There was norupture with Thebes;the constructions continued, and magnificent edifices were raised to the gloryof Amon at Karnak,Gourna, and Ramesseum. But it was from the [Osirian] center of Abydos thatRameses appointedthe High Priest of Amon. Then he installed two of his sons, Merytum andKhamuast, as the HighPriests of Ra at Heliopolis and Ptah at Memphis, and demonstrated by furthermonuments andpolitical favors his public support of these gods. But finally, wearied ofThebes and its ambitiouspriests, he departed to build a new capital, Pi-Rameses, in the eastern delta -where he couldquietly worship the god dearest to him, with Amon occupying a secondaryprominence.The provincial cities where Set had been worshipped from all eternity - amongthem Ombos,Tjebu, and Sepermeru - gained new preeminence from the favor accorded by theRamessideleaders to the god of the Eastern Delta. Above all, Pi-Rameses, the new capital,brilliantly restoredthe worship that Set had formerly received in the Avaris of the Hyksos. 29During the Setian Dynasties - most probably during the reign of Merenptah - therevolt and“exodus” of a number of nomads (hieroglyphic habiru) living in Egypt’s Goshenprovinceoccurred - or at least did so in Jewish legend. Although “Old Testament” lorestates that theoriginal Hebrews were a unified, foreign culture which entered Egypt during thetime ofRameses I, there are no Egyptian records substantiating this. It is moreprobable that the actualparticipants in any “exodus” were people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.30 Possibly theHebrews’ hated “Satan” derives from one of the honorific titles ( Set-hen =Eternal Set) accordedthe state deity of the regime they were fleeing.Following the passing of the two Setian dynasties, the increasing influence of apriesthoodnot courted by the Ramesside pharaohs - that of Osiris - boded ill for thePriesthood of Set. TheOsirians recast Set as Osiris’ treacherous brother and mortal enemy of Osiris’son - for whomthey appropriated the neter Horus. Not content with attacking Set personally,they furtherappropriated his consort and son from the original triad of his cult - Nepthysand Anubis - whomthey now described respectively as a concubine of Osiris and a son of Osiris byNepthys.Comments E.A. Wallis Budge:Between the XXII and the XXV Dynasties, a violent reaction set in against thisgod [Set]; hisstatues and figures were smashed; his effigy was hammered out from thebas-reliefs and stelæ inwhich it appeared. 3129 Ibid., pages #183-184.30 Romer, John, Testament. New York: Henry Holt, 1988, page #58: “Hard evidenceof the Exodus event in thepreserving deserts of the Sinai, where most of the biblical Wandering takesplace, is similarly elusive. Although itsclimate has preserved the tiniest traces of ancient bedouin encampments and thesparse, 5,000-year-old villages ofmine-workers, there is not a single trace of Moses or the Israelites. And theywould have been by far the largest bodyof ancient people ever to have lived in this great wilderness. Neither is thereany evidence that Sinai and its littlenatural springs could ever have supported such a multitude, even for a singleweek. Several 19th-century vicarsrecognized this fact within a day or two of the start of numerous expeditions insearch of Moses’ footsteps. “Escapingfrom the rigours of an English winter,” as one of them says, “in a land of theflock and the tent to which our onlyguide was the Bible” they quickly realized that the biblical Exodus waslogistically impossible and that the Bible wasa most ambiguous guide to that desolate region. The biblical description of theExodus, then, flies in the face ofpractical experience. Indeed the closer you examine it, the further it seemsremoved from all of ancient history.”31 Budge, The Mummy. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1973, page #276.- 38 -Various reasons for this reaction have been proposed by Egyptologists. It isbeen suggestedthat Set fell into disrepute through being associated in the popular mind withthe Sutekh of theinvading Hyksos. Possible, but improbable, as the Hyksos invasion occurred priorto the XIX-XXDynasties when Set was preeminently in favor - and the presiding neter overEgypt’s greatestperiod of imperial glory.Set’s eclipse may well have been due to a more subtle, yet pervasive sentimentsweepingEgypt. As Sauneron and many other Egyptologists have acknowledged, Egyptianphilosophy wasbased upon a millennia-old conviction of the absolute presence and influence ofthe neteru, andin the virtue of a social system in which the preservation of cyclical harmonywas all-important.While the New Empire of the XIX-XX Dynasties extended Egypt’s influence toPalestine andMesopotamia, it also made the Egyptians aware that there were many otherfunctioning culturesin which the neteru were unknown [at least by their Egyptian names]. Moreoverthe concept ofEgypt as just one among a number of nation-states competing for power andinfluence in theMediterranean, rather than as the one civilization at the center of existence,must have been amost unsettling one to this ancient culture - which previously had been able todiscount itsneighbors as mere uncultured, barbarian tribes.Egypt’s solution to this problem was to turn gradually away from a glorificationof this lifeand towards an orientation on the afterlife, where such disturbing dilemmascould be assumednot to exist. This would explain the growing influence and popularity of theOsiris cult during thepost-XX Dynasty Egyptian decadence, as Osiris was a neter of the afterlife.As the Osiris cult portrayed Set as Osiris’ nemesis rather than an independentandpreexisting neter with no particular interest in Osiris, this would also explainthe simultaneouswave of Setian persecution described by Budge. It was characteristic of ancientEgypt that eachnew dynasty, in an attempt to establish its own “timelessness”, often doctoredmonuments andrecords to eliminate inconvenient inconsistencies. Presumably the Osiriandynasties followedsuit, defacing or rewriting all references to Set that did not support theirportrayal of him as a“Devil”. 32 And that was the distortion of Set which survived in laterMediterranean legend -principally through Plutarch, who described it in some detail in his Moralia. 33Commencing in 1975, therefore, the Temple of Set sought to return to anoriginal,undistorted apprehension of Set. In keeping with our modern levels of knowledge,of course, thisimage has been both enhanced and refined. Enhanced in that we now understandbetter than theancient Egyptians how the material universe functions, refined to exclude facetsof the humanpersonality that are natural, externally-controlled functions.At the same time, contemporary civilization’s impatience and superficiality -its restlessinability to study anything metaphysical in any depth - have tended to condensethe delicate,complex study of Egyptian cosmology into a crude caricature capable of beingdigested bymodern minds in a few hours at most. Initiates of the Temple of Set must resolveto take the timeto apprehend and appreciate Set - and the other Egyptian neteru - in the samecontemplative,reflective, and above all unhurried fashion that their ancient predecessors did.Only then will themagnificence, subtlety, and depth of this metaphysical system be realized andappreciated. Onlythen can its principles be applied meaningfully within our current environment.In the first few years of the young Temple of Set, we weren’t quite so clearabout this. We dulyplunged into many works of conventional Egyptology, some of the more useful ofwhich are stillincluded in the Egypt/Historical and Egypt/Philosophical categories of ourReading List.Various Setians contributed some research articles of this genre to the Scroll,Ruby Tablet, and32 Ions, op.cit. , pages #72-78. The Osirian legends on this subject are treatedcomprehensively in J. Gwyn Griffith’sThe Conflict of Horus and Seth (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers, 1969).33 Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, Volume V in Moralia.- 39 -Order & Element publications. But it soon became clear to us that, absent anempathy for Egypt- a sensation of its innate soul, as it were - all such studies were sterile andlifeless exercises.The greatest breakthrough for us came in our encounter with the writings of RenéSchwallerde Lubicz and his wife Isha. Indeed the lion’s - I should say lioness’ - shareof the credit goes toher, because much of René’s work is highly technical. Isha was able tosynthesize its elementalthemes into her highly-readable “novel” Her-Bak, being the story of a youngEgyptian’s journeyfrom ordinary peasant to initiated priest. 34 For many Setians, once they wereexposed to thebasic structure of René’s thought through Her-Bak, his more complex works weresoonunlocked.And suddenly ancient Egypt came wonderfully, vibrantly to life before us. Now,knowingwhat to look for and what to do with it once we found it, the Temple of Setdiscovered no end ofwonders over the years, as of course we continue to do today.René’s initial realization came from his study of hieroglyphs: that in additionto theirconvenience for mere alphabetics, they embodied symbolic principlesapprehensible to both therational and the suprarational intelligence. [His methodology is thus oftentermed“Symbolism”.] Gradually he extended his awareness of this key to Egyptianculture into itsarchitecture (as in his magnum opus examination of the Luxor temple complex, LeTemple deL’Homme) and pre-Pythagoreanism.Of the various works examining René’s ideas in the Temple’s Reading List, Ithink I wouldrecommend John Anthony West’s Serpent in the Sky as the most“immediately-intelligible”introduction. 35 It is at least better-suited to the impatient modern readerthan the Her-Bak weearliest Setians strolled patiently, if pleasantly through!Another very capable presentation is Egyptian Mysteries by Lucie Lamy, René’slongtimestudent and the talented illustrator for both his works and Isha’s. 36Beyond these two introductory works [and of course Her-Bak if you have apeacefuldisposition and plenty of contemplation-time], I need say nothing. Once the dooropens for you,you will see, well, “wonderful things”! You will suddenly understand the templesas media forliving, active interaction with the neteru. 37And of course you will meet those neteru. Not the two-dimensional, comic-booksimpletonscherished by profane Egyptologists, enmeshed in tawdry tales of sex, violence,and meaninglessritual. But the beautiful, wonderful weavers of the most delicate webs of theObjective Universeitself. In their presence, severally and collectively, the awakened Initiatewill confront an eternityof discovery and synthetic creativity.And yet the most difficult neter to meet is Set. Because to apprehend all of theothers oneneed only look outward, through the lenses you have learned to fashion for yourenlightenedvision.But where are you going to place your lever, direct your lens, focus yourattention, to see intothe nucleus, the central fire, of the thing that is your own conscious self?34 Schwaller de Lubicz, Isha, Her-Bak.

New York: Crossroad, 1981.37 But not necessarily the three Giza pyramids,whose construction is not onlyhuman-impossible but whose passagesand chambers are not human-proportioned or -functional. As devices of extremeisolation and sensory deprivation,they are in effect “Faraday cages” to disrupt the electromagnetic spectrum andkeep the neteru out, not welcomethem in. Self-conscious entities venturing therein for any amount of time wouldbe subject to severe deteriorationof coherence, triggering, if anything, subsoul manifestations not unlikeForbidden Planet’s id-monster. I see themthus as singularly and conspicuously non-Egyptian [various later Egyptianimitations notwithstanding], though ofstill-elusive origin and purpose.- 40 -For that is the mirror through which Set will gradually become more and moredistinct, tothose with the intelligence, discipline, determination, and initiation to seehim. And when and ifyou achieve this, you will simultaneously - and necessarily - experience awonder equally assublime: you will behold your own true, complete, ultimate divinity.In the original Stargate motion picture, the Great Pyramid of Giza was revealedto be nothingmore than a crude, ritualistic imitation by fearful protodynastic Egyptians ofthe gigantic,pyramidal starships in which creatures beyond their comprehension had come toEarth; thestone coffer in the “King’s Chamber” was a similar rough image of the wondrousmachine in thestarships with the power to literally bring dead bodies back to life.In that film, as well as the elegant television series it subsequently inspired,the alien “gods”were not quite the neteru they pretended to be - simply an advanced speciesusing “divine”imagery as a means of psychological domination of others as well as for theirown exoticpleasures. Nevertheless these Goa’uld almost uncannily demonstrated therelationship whichordinary humanity has with its perceived “God/gods” - and why it is quitefulfilled by such arelationship, false and oppressive as it may be.In world after world, civilization after civilization, it is ever the same; andwhen a Goa’uld isexposed or killed, the result is always chaos and uncertainty, with the“liberated” peoplesslipping down into aimless, tedious tribalism. The wanton terrors of the Goa’uldare gone - butso are the great, gleaming Pyramidal starships, the technology to instantly healall injuries andeven restore bodily life itself, and the ecstatic experience of interacting withthe “gods” face-to-face. It is now, again, the Fourth Age of Middle-earth.Stargate leaves its audience with an even more tantalizing mystery. If theGoa’uld borrowtheir personæ from real neteru whom they have used advanced technology toimitate, how didthey originally come to know them?Which leads to my central question about the ancient Egyptians: Why didn’t theirculture“develop”? I believe that the evidence shows that their arts, sciences,mathematics, technology,techniques of warfare are all there complete from the beginning. What I want toargue here todayis that the Egyptians of the pre-Old Kingdom era somehow “inherited” all thesearts and sciences.Then after a short “getting acquainted” period, we see the full flowering ofwhat we call ancientEgypt ...- Lecture, Daniel Jackson, Ph.D.Scottish Rite Temple4357 Wilshire BoulevardLos Angeles, California,December 1992[index-41_1.jpg][index-41_2.jpg]- 41 -4: 22nd and KansasOn the morning of June 22, 1975 I felt less like a magician and more like thevictim of amugging. I had undertaken what I had anticipated as a Greater Black Magicalworking to placethe recent critical events in the Church of Satan in some sort ofconstructive-repair context.Instead the entire structure had been discarded and its patron, Satan, remorphedinto an ancientEgyptian god. The previous six years of my initiatory life, from the time when Ihad joined theChurch, had in the space of a few hours become obsolete.Named a Magus and charged to [re]build a Temple of Set, I considered that I knewnothingabout being a Magus, little about ancient Egypt generally, and less about Set inparticular. Not tomention that beyond the walls of my study, my initiatory colleagues from theChurch of Satanquite understandably still considered themselves Satanists and believed in themetaphysicalbasis for, if no longer in the organizational ruins of the Church.Well, I had to start somewhere. I telephoned Lilith Sinclair at her home inSummerland, awooded suburb of Santa Barbara, and asked if I could visit to show her therecord of last night’sGBM working. She read through it silently, then somewhat to my surprise simplynodded herassent. The Book of Coming Forth by Night had instantly struck her as authentic,beyondnecessity for explanation, substantiation, or argument. This was a phenomenonwhich, to myfascination, was to accompany the document henceforth - not for every reader,but for thosewho, as it turned out, were consciously or unconsciously looking for the kind ofinitiatory “lens”that the Temple of Set turned out to be.The following day I made thirty photocopies of the text and sent them to thePriesthood andRegional Agents of the Church. One of the first replies came from WarlockWilliam Murray ofWinnemucca, Nevada:What can I say about the Book of Coming Forth by Night? It is awesome. ARevelation. Thetrue Mandate of the Dark. Holy Hastur, did it clear up a lot for me! Believe itor not, I knew thesethings - but, as has happened in the past, could not give voice to them, even inmy own mind. 38And that too proved to be a characteristic of the Book of Coming Forth by Nightover theyears: that upon reading its statements, potential Setians did not consider them“new”, butrather as truths which they had personally sensed, yet never quite given theirown voice topreviously.But generally the sentiment of recipients of the initial thirty copies was, as Ihad expected,more one of “wait and see”. The recent shocks and surprises concerning theChurch of Satan had38 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, June 25, X/1975.- 42 -been unsettling enough; a purported revelation from a god would have to wait itsemotional/rational/critical turn.I turned my attention to the structural and operational design of the new Templeof Set. Inthis I realized I was very much on my own. Not only was I the most seniorofficial of the Church -the only one of the IV°+ to have disavowed it - but none of the other Satanistswho had alsoresigned had any concept of or experience with organizational mechanics.Bringing themembership into the Temple’s functioning would be essential to its futureviability and survival,but that would have to happen later. I would need to do the initial work myself.The Church of Satan had been a California for-profit corporation with Anton andDianeLaVey as its sole members. Membership in the Church as a religious affiliationhad not carriedwith it corporate membership, even at the Priesthood level. Thus, when Antondecided tocorrupt the degree system in 1975, Church members had no legal interest orrecourse. TheChurch’s for-profit status [as a “business”] had also kept it from qualifyingfor federal or statetax-exempt status as a religious institution.These I would remedy. The Temple of Set would not belong to myself, butcollectively to thePriesthood of Set (III°+) as members of its corporation. And that corporationwould be aCalifornia nonprofit corporation organized as a church. Federal and CaliforniaState tax-exemptstatus as a religion would be sought, establishing the Temple’s [and allSetians’] full right to FirstAmendment Constitutional recognition and protection.Thematically I thought the Temple should continue/evolve from the Church, sothat it wouldinclude an initiatory degree system, a national [later international] office,and local groups. Theformal Priesthood was clearly to be continued, and the concept of a HighPriesthood and aCouncil of Nine seemed essential as well. Beyond these very general assumptions,the sheet ofpaper was clean.I had had the benefit of six years’ supervisory work with the Church, and priorto that mypersonal involvement with various nonprofit organizations such as the Knights ofDunamis(Eagle Scout honor society of the Boy Scouts of America) and Alpha Phi OmegaFraternity. I hadbeen National Commander of the former in 1965 and the University of California,Santa BarbaraChapter President of the latter in 1967. In both I had worked extensively ontheir internal design.A Temple of Set presented several new and unusual challenges and requirements.Asindicated in the Book of Coming Forth by Night, it was essential that it supportinitiation as auniquely individual experience. Thus it was to be an “organization forindividuals”, somethingof a tension if not outright contradiction. [The ominous metaphor of “herdingcats” came tomind!]The Church of Satan’s initiatory degree system had worked well enough,particularly as it hadbeen regularly reworked and refined over the years. But by Temple of Setrequirements it wasunacceptably vague, limited in scope, and symbolically obsolete. It had beenloosely modeled onthe grade structure of Aleister Crowley’s A.'.A.'., the predecessor mostfamiliar to Anton LaVey. Iwent back into the documents of the A.'.A.'. and its own predecessor, theHermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, to study the rationale behind those grade systems. While both wereloosely linkedto the Hebrew Cabalistic “Tree of Life” then fashionable among European occultsocieties, I sawthreads extending from them through the Church of Satan that were indeedsuitable to theselatest, most advanced requirements of the Temple of Set.The Church had had two participant (Satanist I°, Witch/Warlock II°) and threePriesthood(Priest/ess of Mendes III°, Magister IV°, Magus V°) degrees. The I° signifiedonly formalaffiliation. The II° represented passage of a fairly simple written test basedupon the contents ofthe Satanic Bible. The III° and IV° were conferred by Anton LaVey, based in parton a moreextensive written/essay examination and in part on his personal evaluation ofthe individual.The V° remained, as of 1975, a designation for Anton’s own initiatory standingas distinct from- 43 -his High Priesthood office. The Magister IV° was subdivided into -CaverniIV°-I', -Templi IV°-II',and -Magnus IV°-III', with the intent that they function administrativelysimilar to bishops,archbishops, and cardinals once the Church eventually grew to require same. [Adetaileddescription of the Church’s degree system, and its somewhat confusing dualnames, can be foundin Appendix #39 of my Church of Satan.]I rethought all of this comprehensively.It did not seem to me that a person could properly claim to be an “initiate”simply byexpressing a desire to become one and paying an affiliation fee. The Temple ofSet’s I° mustidentify formal affiliation and appreciate the individual’s desire, yet stopshort of representinghim as someone actually initiated. Per the guidance of the Book of Coming Forthby Night, Idetermined that the I° [as well as all affiliation generally] should be called“Setian”, and shouldbe regarded as a transitional phase between ordinary existence and initiation.For that reason,instead of the red I° Baphomet of the Church, the medallion of the Setian I°would be white.The Witch/Warlock II° of the Church had signified the passage of a basic test.In the priororganizations, past the “entrance grade”, there had been a long ladder ofknowledge-grades toclimb, signifying laborious accumulation of useless/trivial occult obscurata.The most generalprefix for these stages had been “Adept”, and that sounded correct enoughproviding that therecipient was indeed adept at being what he was supposed to be, in our case apractitioner ofBlack Magic. So our II° would be “Adept”, and it would signify precisely that.The Church’s II°Baphomet had been white; our medallion was therefore red, the color of Set inancient Egyptianimagery.The Priesthood III° required only a name-change: from “of Mendes” to “of Set”.The former,within the Church, derived not from any intended Egyptian association but ratherfrom one ofthe Devil’s traditional titles as the “Goat of Mendes”.Things got more complex beyond the III°. In the same sense as in the Church, thePriesthoodof Set was the essential distinction between skilled-individual anddeputized-individual, so tospeak. Hence “higher” degrees in the Temple should properly be considered“aspects” or“enhancements” of the Priesthood.In the G.'.D.'. and A.'.A.'. (which, as non-religious entities did not havepriesthoods per se),initiation beyond the highest adeptship (Adeptus Exemptus) involved a formalrite of passage“across the Abyss” [separating individual consciousness from that partaking ofGod/YHVH]. TheG.'.D.'., indeed, regarded such transition as so profound as to be attainableonly by disincarnate“ascended Masters”. In Crowley’s A.'.A.'. crossing of the Abyss could be done byincarnatedhumans (as exemplified in his The Vision and The Voice record), but stilldenoted an evolutionfrom human to divine consciousness.My first premise was that if the Temple of Set’s degree system were to be purelyinitiatory,none of its designations should be confused or “dual-hatted” with administrativeororganizational functions. Additionally the threefold subdivision of the Church’sIV° had noinitiatory significance.Our IV° would retain the title of “Magister/Magistra Templi”, as a “Master (inthe sense of asage) of the Temple [of Set]”. There was no reference to a Cabalistic “Abyss”,and there was noessential metamorphosis of consciousness, as that has already occurred at theIII°. So what doeschange at this level of initiation? The Book of Coming Forth by Night hadidentified an “Æon ofSet” as a unique perspective on existence characteristic of Setian initiation.The Magistry, itseemed to me, should properly identify those individuals who, beyond theirPriesthoods, hadbecome so aware of, attuned to, and harmonized with the atmosphere of the Æonthat itsrepresentation had become their “center of gravity”, their accustomed mode ofexistence. Yes,that sounded appropriate - even setting aside for the moment the inconveniencethat I had yet tograpple with what the Æon of Set was all about!- 44 -The V° of Magus seemed easier. Anton had been one, I was now one, and becauseeach of ushad started an initiatory organization, yes? In his case possibly, since he hadtaken on that titleas a symbolic borrow from Crowley; he occasionally used a longer variation,“Satanic Master”.But here again the Book of Coming Forth by Night went into somewhat more detailconcerningthe term, including its context as “Magus of the Æon of Set”. This fulfilledCrowley’s definition ofa Magus as the announcer or formulator of an æon. It also complemented our IV°:A Magusapprehended a new æon; a Master comprehended it.I carried over the colors of the III° to V° that I had recommended and Antonapproved for theChurch: black, blue, and purple. Black represented the Prince & Powers ofDarkness. Blue I hadtaken from the robes of history’s most famous ancient sages, the priest-kings ofPlato’s Atlantis.And purple from its royal connotation, and from the Book of the Law’s referenceto the Magus’“purple beyond purple” magical eyesight.In 1975 I left unaddressed, as had the Church, any state of initiation beyondMagus. TheG.'.D.'. and A.'.A.'. both included an ultimate grade of Ipsissimus, but wereequally vagueconcerning its characteristics. Evidently someone so thoroughly initiated couldhardly bedescribed at all!Having conceptualized these degrees, at least so far as was possible a priori in1975, I turnedto the task of how to properly entitle them to individuals. In the Church allsuch designationshad been determined personally by Anton LaVey, who was responsible only to hisown integrity,and as was taken for granted to Satan, for such decisions. While this had workedwell enough fornine years, we had all seen the disastrous consequences of his abrogating thosetworesponsibilities in 1975.Nor, of course, did I envision the Temple of Set as an institution of which Iwould be thepermanent and only High Priest.The solution seemed inherent in the characteristics of the degrees. A III°should, with theperception and authority of the Priesthood of Set, be able to recognize anInitiate who hadbecome genuinely adept in the application of Black Magic. And yes, recognitionwas the properterm too, in an environment wherein initiation was inescapably individual.Similarly a Master should be able to recognize a Priest of Set within the Æon.Recognition of a Magus past the Book of Coming Forth by Night was again achallenge.Characteristic of a Magus is Utterance of a Word (creation of a philosophy)beyond what isconventionally or currently known. A Master “within” in an æon cannot beexpected to be able torecognize something “without” it. But a college of æonic Masters mightconceivably agree onboth the current æon’s limits and the initiatory substance of a philosophicalconcept beyond it. Idecided to proceed from this assumption.While for the sake of simplicity here I have used the masculine degree-titles,it was alwaysunderstood that the Setian initiation system applied equally to women asPriestess, Magistra,and Maga. In the Church no women ever advanced past the III°, and the elderinitiatoryorganizations tended to be male-exclusive past the Adepti grades. The Temple ofSet’s initiatoryand official gender-indifference has remained axiomatic throughout its history.Now came the administrative structure of the Temple. I knew what I didn’t want:a one-mandictatorship as in the Church. Again that had worked well as long as Anton hadexercised hisauthority wisely and benevolently, but when he hadn’t, it disintegrated. Drawingon my Knightsof Dunamis and Alpha Phi Omega experience, I resolved to design an organizationwithcooperative, interlocking, and authority-sharing branches. I had also theconvenient model ofthe United States Constitution, with its balance-of-power divisions of theexecutive, legislative,and judicial.Like the Church, the Temple of Set would have a High Priest and a Council ofNine. Unlikethe Church, the Temple’s Council of Nine would be collectively superior to theHigh Priesthood,- 45 -with the power of appointment and removal. This would be codified in aCalifornia nonprofitArticles of Incorporation (Appendix #6 [original]) and By-Laws (Appendix #7[current 2006]),and the degree system would be included in those same By-Laws beyond alterationby either theHigh Priest or the Council.Finally to counterbalance the executive power of the High Priesthood, twoadditional offices,also corporate, would be created: Executive Director (to oversee all Templeadministration) andTreasurer (to oversee Temple finances). The Treasurer would respond to theExecutive Director,who would respond to the High Priest, in routine matters; but all three officerswould beindividually accountable to, and appointed/removed by, the Council of Nine.Underlying these formal organizational arrangements was my intention that theyshould beas “invisible” as possible in the normal course of Temple affairs. The focus ofthe Temple’sattention should be upon magical, philosophical, and initiatory matters, notadministrative ones.The legal structure and its By-Laws should properly be in the background as aconsensualframework, coming to notice only as a specific situation might require.I thought that I had worked all of this out pretty well, and over thirty yearslater I can say thatboth the degree system and the organizational structure of the Temple of Sethave stood the testof time very satisfactorily. Along the years we have adjusted, improved, andrefined both asnecessary or desirable, but those basic 1975 premises and principles have allremained.The next step was to fill the initial offices, of which that of ExecutiveDirector was easily themost crucial. This person (required to be III°+) would be at the nerve center ofall Templeadministrative communications and operations. While there were many Priests andPriestessesfrom the Church who could have taken on the job, I was looking for someone whowould enjoyand thrive in it - who was naturally involved with everyone and everythingeverywhere. Onename came instantly to mind - Bill Murray.As documented in The Church of Satan, Warlock William F. Murray had been aRegionalAgent of the Church in Winnemucca, a small town hundreds of miles from anywhereelse in themiddle of the Nevada desert. [Winnemucca’s one bank has a plaque boasting thatit was oncerobbed by Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch.] Whatever Warlock Murray lacked ingroupcontact, however, he made up for in a flurry of correspondence, telephone calls,and his RegionalAgent/Carpathia Chapel newsletter Children of the Night. So central a crossroadshad he becomeby 1974 that the LaVeys, as also recounted in COS, began to become alarmed; iffor some reasonhe became disaffected, he could conceivably cause quite a widespreadchain-reaction throughoutthe Church. They ordered him to restrict his contacts to his Regional Agency,but a short timelater the crisis of 1975 overwhelmed that attempted clampdown.Just how much of a clearinghouse Warlock Murray had become by then can beillustrated byjust one of a number of his letters to me at the time (Appendix #9).Bill Murray might have been the bane of an authoritarian system seeking to keepitsextensions isolated from one another, but he was exactly what the Temple of Setwould need inits Executive Director. I asked him if he could drive to San Francisco, and Iwould come up fromSanta Barbara so that we could talk things over. We met at my mother’s house onSaturday, June28th and spent the next day going over my ideas for the new Temple. On Sunday,to clear ourheads, we went out for a drive around the city, and when we happened to pass theobscureintersection of 22nd and Kansas Streets over on the Potrero Hill, Bill finallysaid yes, that hewould take on the Executive Directorship.Constituting the first Council of Nine was another interesting challenge. What Ifinallydecided to do was to invite three of the most senior Priests as initial members,ask them tounanimously select a pro tem Chairman from among themselves, then tonominate/vote in afourth, then for those four to nominate/vote in a fifth, and so on until thefull nine initialCouncillors had been elected. Then they could formally vote on a first regularChairman.- 46 -This arrangement worked very well. On the auspicious date of July 4th - the sameday Ifinalized the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws - I invited Dale Seago fromLos Angeles,Michael Grumboski from Detroit, and Robert Ethel from Washington, D.C. to be thefirst threeCouncillors. When the first Council was finally filled by December 1975, itconsisted additionallyof Thomas Huddleston of Dayton, Ohio; Ronald K. Barrett of San Francisco,California; LilithSinclair of Santa Barbara, California; Jinni Bast of Spotswood, New Jersey; AmnDeCecco ofFramingham, Massachusetts, and Margaret Wendall of San Jose, California.Also on July 4 I sent copies of the initial Articles and By-Laws to the formerChurch officialsand Agents who by then had endorsed the idea of the Temple of Set: Adept TomBari, AdeptRonald K. Barrett, Priest Robert DeCecco, Priest Robert Ethel, Priest MichaelGrumboski, AdeptThomas Huddleston, Adept William Murray, Adept Stuart Munro, Priest MichaelMcQuown,Adept Lynn Norton, Priest Dale Seago, Priestess Lilith Sinclair, PriestessMargaret Wendall, andAdept Arthur Zabrecky.Legally the original Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws were signed on July29, August 1,and August 7 by the three “filing” directors, Bill Murray, Dale Seago, andmyself. They wereofficially approved by the California Secretary of State on October 23 and filedin Superior Courton October 28, 1975.One Section of the initial By-Laws authorized the High Priest to make initiatorydegreedeterminations prior to the By-Laws’ official adoption, and to communicate allsuchdeterminations to the Executive Director and Council of Nine not later thanOctober 31. On July15, in one of my letters to the II°+, I wrote:To date I have exercised the right of recognition only three times - each aninstance of animbalance that should have been corrected long ago [in the Church of Satan].These threeelevations were those of Stuart Munro of Ottawa to Adept II°, William F. Murrayof Winnemuccato Priest of Set III°, and Ronald K. Barrett of San Francisco to Priest of SetIII°.My original intent was to make no IV° nominations until the first Council ofNine was selectedand operational. My reasoning was based upon two factors: (1) According to theBy-Laws, IV°nominations must be approved by a majority of the Nine before taking effect. (2)IV° nominationsby me prior to the selection of the entire Council might be viewed as a means ofinfluencing thecomposition of the Council."},{"pageContent":"But a problem has arisen that has caused me to rethink this. The problem is asfollows: TheCouncil must consist of III°+ individuals. If we simply use existing Church ofSatan degrees forqualification, the potential number of persons who can be considered for Councilmembership isquite limited. Furthermore we are aware that the impartiality and effectiveinternationalgeographic coverage of the C/S degrees were breaking down long before now. Ipersonally know ofseveral II° individuals who may very well deserve the III°. And yet I do notknow them wellenough to make a decision on the matter as thorough as a proper III° recognitionshould be.I have decided to resolve the matter in a fashion which I trust will reflect theWill and Mandateof Set.At this time, prior to the formal implementation of the By-Laws, I am namingfive ladies andgentlemen to the IV°. Without exception they are well-known throughout ourentire fellowship asPriests or Priestesses of long standing, high reputation, and distinguishedachievement. Inaddition it is my considered opinion that each one of them possesses theinitiatory qualitiesindicative of a Master of the Temple of Set. Put as directly as possible, thesequalities involve anintrinsic and proven capability to make decisions and take actionsrepresentative of the Prince ofDarkness without an intentional effort to do so. From a magical standpoint thisis the primarydistinction between the III° and the IV°, inasmuch as the Priest or PriestessIII° has access to thispower when consciously and deliberately seeking it.In the name of Set, therefore, I now recognize as Masters of the Temple IV°:Robert Ethel,Michael A. Grumboski, L. Dale Seago, Lilith Sinclair, and Margaret A. Wendall.- 47 -“Behold, it is I who call you, because you are the guardians of the Æon of Set,zealous in whatyou do.” 39August 21 marked the first of my High Priesthood bulletins to the Priesthood ofSet. At thetime these were casually called “Xerox letters”; eventually they would beformalized into thePriesthood newsletter Hieroglyphs. #III-1 went through five pages of generalfounding details,from which the following is particularly noteworthy:“Pylons”: I have had several inquiries and ideas concerning the name that wouldbe used forlocal units of the Temple. Neither “coven” nor “grotto” seemed appropriate.Priest Ronald Barrettcame up with “Pylon”, and everyone who has heard of it so far has been sittingup and barking. SoPylon it is. The reference is to the great trapezoidal pylon gates of majorEgyptian temples.Barrett’s idea is that each Pylon of the Temple of Set is in one sense a “gate”to the entire Temple.Magistra Margaret A. Wendall has accepted Editorship of the Scroll of Set. Shewill have a100% free hand on all contents, so I can’t tell you exactly what will appear inthe first issue. But, ifit’s anything like her famous Magic Cat, I’m sure we will not be disappointed.The first issueshould be out next month. I hope you will give her as much feedback andassistance as youpossibly can. Remember that the Scroll is the only regular means via which wecan reach out andtouch isolated I°/II° members, so it has a mammoth job to do. 40Two subsequent events marked the completion of the Temple of Set’s initialorganizationprocess. The first was a letter from the State of California Franchise TaxBoard, exempting theTemple of Set from State taxes as a religious corporation. 41 The second was aletter from theUnited States Internal Revenue Service, exempting the Temple of Set from Federalincome taxunder section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 42 Both represented monthsofcorrespondence between myself and their respective offices, providing extensiveand detailedanswers to their questions concerning the corporate organization and religiousprinciples of theTemple. We were now, as far as the United States of America was concerned, fullyand formallycredentialed.Magister Dale Seago had served as Chairman Pro Tem of the Council of Nine duringtheseveral months of its initial formative nomination/voting process. When inOctober all seatswere filled, lots were drawn to establish initial terms of office, with oneexpiring each year, thussetting up overlapping nine-year terms. Then in December 1975 the Councilelected its first fullChairman, Magister Robert Ethel. Dale Seago remained a Councillor, of course, aswell as theTemple’s corporate Treasurer.“Well,” as the Founding Fathers are rumored to have said at the completion ofthe UnitedStates’ Constitutional Convention in 1787, “now that we’re organized, what do wedo next?” 4339 Aquino, M.A., Letter #II°-8, July 15, X/1975.40 Aquino, M.A., Letter #III°-1, August 21, X/1975.41 Letter, Albert D.

With a founding membership of about one hundred, mostveterans ofthe Church of Satan, it was ready to move forward. So where was “forward”?The Left-Hand Path of least resistance, it would seem, was to continue alongmuch the sameactivity as the Church, merely exchanging Judæo-Christian dæmonic symbolism forancientEgyptian. But numerous problems with such a casual approach quickly becameapparent.The Book of Coming Forth by Night, of course, clearly called for not just areformation of theChurch of Satan, but an entirely distinct orientation for Temple-affiliatedindividuals.But apart from this a number of inadequacies and inconsistencies in the Churchhad beenbecoming steadily more visible, and uncomfortable, during its decade ofmaturation.The “founding theology” of the Church had been easy: Christianity derided andlampooned,through the use of imagery which it itself had created to scare its ownfollowers into obedience.As there was plenty of corruption and hypocrisy to be found in Christianinstitutions, the Churchof Satan’s program here was easy indeed. However it was a “denunciation” that,once made,really did not need endless repeating, particularly among Satanists themselves.O.K., soChristianity is childish, hypocritical, and corrupt: point made and taken. Sowhere do we go fromhere?Satanists inevitably, if reluctantly realized that their own deity, Satan, was aJudæo/Islamic/Christian myth-image every bit as much as YHVH. Generally Satan simply stood forwhateverGod either didn’t like/permit, or wasn’t willing to be blamed for. It is truethat variousiconoclasts and poetic heretics throughout history - Milton, Blake, Twain, etal. - had shockedand tantalized their audiences with varying heroic/romantic spins on the Devil.But invariably itall came to the same consensual baseline: Satan was bad, harmful, false, andevil.Satanists generally grappled with this in two ways. First, they affected theiralliance with thespooky, scary Devil and his dæmonic entourage; this impressed and intimidatedmany mainlinereligionists. Secondly, if somewhat inconsistently, they asserted that Satan wasreally not thatreprehensible a fellow after all; he had just been the victim of a propagandasmear campaign byhis enemies.By 1975 the limitations of this essentially defensive and negative posture hadbecome moreand more apparent. Satanists had made it clear that they didn’t likeJudæo-Christianity. Theyhad insisted that its version of the Devil was also all wrong, at least whereobviously vileattributes and practices were concerned. But beyond these positions - which, inAmerica’soverwhelmingly Christian culture, took seemingly endless reexplanation andreaffirmation - theyhad nowhere else to go. As noted in The Church of Satan, Anton LaVey ultimatelydisengagedfrom the dilemma, turning his personal “Satan” into a narcissistic andsentimental nostalgia for- 50 -the underbelly of 1940s’ society. His personal charisma and artistic talentenabled him to indulgein this reorientation more extensively and intriguingly than just about anyoneelse could have,and it certainly carried his glamor along, at least among society’s alienatedmarginalia, until hisdeath.However other Satanists, myself included, were not in the least interested insimilarly cryinginto our beer. For us the Church, and the confrontation of Satan and Satanism,had been an evermore electrifying and exhilarating adventure. We had taken a stand, the mostdaring stand,against the “norm” not only of society, but of the very universe itself. We tookfierce pride inbeing “ultimate heretics”, the more so because after our affirmation of suchheresy, here we stillstood, unassailed, unpunished, and unrepentant.I saw a shape with human form and face,If such should in apotheosis stand;Deep in the shadows of a desolate landHis burning feet obtained colossal base,And spheral on the lonely arc of space,His head, a menace unto heavens unspanned,Arose with towered eyes that might commandThe sunless, blank horizon of that place.And straight I knew him for the mystic oneThat is the brother, born of human dream,Of man rebellious at an unknown rod;The mind’s ideal, and the spirit’s sun;A column of clear flame, in lands extreme,Set opposite the darkness that is God. 44Perhaps this may explain to the yet-confused why Anton LaVey’s 1975 abandonmentof hisown commitment to this vision so dismayed and angered Satanists to whom it hadbecome that“column of clear flame” in their lives.Nevertheless Anton was gone, and now the Book of Coming Forth by Night wassaying that,this departure notwithstanding, the entire conceptualization of Satan, theChurch of Satan, andindeed their entire Islamic/Judæo/Christian theological edifice, were all wrong,“useless lumberand wreckage” to be thrown on the trash-heap of our previous education andexperience.This, I hardly need observe, was a tall order.Jettisoning the Church of Satan - all that we had been studying, exploring, andrefining forthe past ten years - was daunting enough. But the established conventionalreligions of the worldhad, like it or not, been responsible for the prevalent shaping of humanself-perception over thelast two thousand years. Even in post-Enlightenment Western cultures, Christianassumptionsand habits remain the baseline of society. For one hundred ex-Satanists toventure out into aworld, a cosmos in the utter absence of such an accustomed frame of referenceseemed nothingshort of lunatic.Or it would have had we then taken the time to really confront the implicationsof what wewere then setting out to do.Pathetic earthlings - hurling your bodies out into the void, without theslightest inkling of whoor what is out here. If you had known anything about the true nature of theuniverse, anything atall, you would have hidden from it in terror. 4544 Smith, Clark Ashton, “A Vision of Lucifer” in Selected Poems. Sauk City:Arkham House, 1971, page #155.45 Emperor Ming the Merciless, Ruler of the Universe, in Flash Gordon (1980).- 51 -As discussed in Chapter #3, ancient Egypt proved to be the gateway to the void,in a senseand sophistication that in 1975 we had no way to anticipate. Its academic/archæological imageat the time was [and in those same professional circles remains today] that of amere basicagricultural society with an animal-totem and death-fixated mythology. For theGreat Unwashedit was the stuff of Hollywood mummy horror movies and sword-and-sandal epics,habitually (asin The Ten Commandments) as the bad guy threatening virtuous Jews andprotoChristianmonotheists.To date Egypt had fared little better within organized occultism. Its mysteryhad made itattractive to individuals and organizations selling exactly that, so Egyptianart, costumes, Aida-processions, and talismans were a staple of Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism,Illuminism, and anynumber of greater or lesser imitators, all the way down to Laurel and Hardy’sSons of the Desertfarce (to which Anton LaVey scornfully compared the Temple of Set once helearned of itsEgyptian interests).So had Egypt been a purely arbitrary choice for us, it would have seemed afoolish one,carrying way too much sillified baggage along with its apparently meagerhistorical significance.What overruled all of this - initially for myself and later for a great manyothers over the decadesto follow - was direct contact with one of Egypt’s supposedly false andnonexistent “gods”, Set.“I’d enjoy it all more if I knew what it meant.”That pleased Conchis. He sat back and smiled.“My dear Nicholas, man has been saying what you have just said for the last tenthousandyears. And the one common feature of all the gods he has said it to is that notone of them has everreturned an answer.” 46Only in this instance an answer had been returned, and that mere fact madeeverything verydifferent indeed.Historically humanity has developed its base of knowledge by three means:observation,reasoning, and belief. The first, especially since its release from dogmaticconstraints upon theEnlightenment, has today matured into the well-known “scientific method”. Thesecondoriginally enjoyed prominence dating from the logical discourses of Socrates andhis Greekcolleagues, but except in acknowledged matters of opinion has generally givenway to science.The third - belief - is neither scientific nor logical, indeed emphatically andsometimescombatively so. This is the realm of religion, of superstition, of mere feeling.It can range fromthe staid dictates of organized churches in the name(s) of their God/gods, to asimple, gnawingpersonal conviction that, scientific evidence and/or logical reasoningnotwithstanding, the truthis otherwise.As conventional religion, particularly in the West, has degenerated into littlemore thanunthinking social rote-participation, the average person’s experience withbelief-knowledge isperhaps more easily exemplified by phenomena such as romantic love, which is anemotion orsensation neither scientific nor logical. It is also present in situations oftrust, in which a child,student, subordinate, or disciple accepts something as true because of trust inthe source sostating.In the case of the fledgling Temple of Set, the premises of its identity andauthenticity wereclearly in the realm of belief: mine in the truth of my own apprehension of theBook of ComingForth by Night, and other Setians’ in trust of that belief of mine, at leastuntil such time as theymight experience comparable direct apprehensions of Set. For now the tacitconsensus was togive Magus Michael Aquino plenty of time [and rope] to resolve this mystery ofGreater Black46 Fowles, John, The Magus (Revised Edition 1977). Boston: Little, Brown & Co.,1965, page #185.- 52 -Magic, and in the meantime to see how this new Temple of Set might exercise itstalents in theless-ethereal pursuits of its Lesser cousin.Lesser Black Magic as defined by the Church of Satan referred to the use ofobscure laws ofnature, and/or clever manipulation of situations or perceptions, to facilitateor achieve themagician’s purpose. Thus it was an extension of stage or “carny” magic at itsmost simple, andthe control of entire populations at its other extreme. Until fairly recently inhistory LBM hadbeen practiced only at a modest, localized level, and then as an implicitpersonal skill rather thanas a deliberate, scientific system of power and control. It was as such a skillthat it was exploredby scholars such as Niccolo Machiavelli in The Prince.The Church of Satan’s membership interest in LBM had never gone much beyondimpressing/manipulating the opposite sex or nudging a job promotion. Anton LaVeyliked toclaim dramatic control-workings for himself, the shock-and-awe of whichescalated after 1975until he was grappling with a DERO-like conspiracy of opponents worldwide. 47It was apparent to me that the Temple of Set would, in the normal course of itsfuture, betaking a far more methodical and sophisticated interest in LBM than hadheretofore been thecase. That raised the question of ethical guidelines. If we intended to teachnew Setians theprinciples of LBM and encourage them to apply those principles without theTemple, some self-conscience of rightness/wrongness was essential. Ordinary human societies havelaws, mores,and customs to pre/proscribe specific types of behavior. Since the principlesand techniques ofLBM are generally unknown by those societies, however, there are many gaps inexisting law,and socialization generally, capable of addressing them.During 1974-76, as it happened, I was pursuing a Master’s degree in PoliticalScience at theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara. One of my specialty fields wasPolitical Theory, whichinvolved numerous seminars in philosophy. This could not have come at a morefortuitous time,as it sensitized me to ethical issues and options in a variety of socialcontexts.Two of my professors, William Ebenstein and Raghavan Iyer, were especiallyinfluential.Ebenstein, a student at the University of Vienna and the London School ofEconomics, had goneon to a distinguished teaching career first at Princeton and then at UCSB. Overthe years he hadauthored several benchmark works in political theory, several of which remaininfluential today.Ebenstein liked my work in his seminars, but was clearly distressed over myrefusal to agreewith him that philosophy began with the Greeks. By late 1975 my own research hadconvincedme that Egypt deserved this honor, which I argued in more than one graduatepaper. We finallyreached an amusing but acceptable compromise: He introduced me to HenriFrankfort’s BeforePhilosophy, which paradoxically surveyed “pre-philosophy philosophies”throughout many pre-Greek civilizations of antiquity. [Frankfort also wrote another work, Kingshipand the Gods,which provided important linkages from Plato’s philosopher-kings to thegovernmentalprinciples of Egypt.]Raghavan Iyer had journeyed from his native India to England, where he took hisdoctoratein philosophy at Oxford University before assuming a professorship at UCSB. Theauthor ofseveral brilliant textbooks concerning Gandhi, Plato, and both theoretical andapplied politics,he was also a revered sage in the Theosophical Society, for which he had writtenmany esotericpapers. [Many of these can be found today on the Internet athttp://theosophy.org.]Iyer and I hit it off almost immediately insofar as both of us were fascinatedwith politicalscience in both exo- and esoteric contexts. During many of his seminars, and theinformalcoffeehouse gatherings that often followed them, he and I would arguepassionately about the47 In 1945 the science-fiction magazine Amazing Stories published a tale aboutDEraged RObots lurking insubterranean caves, which, anticipating L. Ron Hubbard’s fictional “dianetics”,was believed as reality by credulouscultists henceforth.- 53 -music of the spheres, immortality/transmigration of the soul, and Atlantis whileother studentsjust gazed at us and shook their heads in bewilderment.Iyer certainly did not doubt the existence of pre-Greek philosophy - he andEbensteinmaintained a respectful professional distance in the Department - but it vexedhim a good dealthat I had been suckered in by the teachings of that disreputable occultcharlatan and crankAnton LaVey. I on the other hand made no secret of my consternation that he hadbeen suckeredin by the teachings of that disreputable occult charlatan and crank HelenaBlavatsky. Thisresulted in a steady stream of “A-” grades for me throughout my studies withhim. He onceremarked that any other student turning in work of my quality would get straight“A”s, but inview of my initiated potential he felt honor-bound to goad me with that “-”. SoI took it as acompliment, and indeed would have been alarmed if at some point it haddisappeared.As Ebenstein had guided my research into ancient political and philosophicalthoughttowards careful, painstaking standards, so Iyer introduced me to the metaphysicsand cosmologyunderlying that same field of study. Both, of course, I took back with me to theTemple of Set,which I increasingly saw as a Pythagorean/Platonic academy destined to go farbeyondconventional social and organizational limits. We would not only undertake trueinitiation asindividual Setians, but the Temple itself would become a metastructure both toenhance ourpersonal efforts and to etherealize its own metaphysical reality.Meanwhile in the ordinary world outside these ivory towers, other influenceswere at work insociety which would also shape aspects of the fledgling Temple of Set. If the1950s had been adecade of Eisenhower-era conformity to traditional American values, the 1960shad rupturedthis comforting norm with the twin shocks of the John Kennedy assassination andthe VietnamWar. Disillusionment and social alienation led to mass movements of popularrebellion andrevolution, which seemed for a brief time to actually be changing the Old Orderfor a morepeaceful and loving New Age. But that in turn lost its energy and innocence withtheassassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and the ultimate hippienightmaresof Charles Manson.By the 1970s many visionaries and utopians had given up on Earth’s humancivilizationsaltogether and were looking for another Way Out - which turned out to be a WayUp, to outerspace. George Lucas’ 1977 Star Wars arrived just in time to touch a match tothis escapism; themovie became a worldwide sensation like nothing before or since. In addition toreenergizing itspredecessor Star Trek, it also jump-started real interest in space colonies andemigration,through such cooperatives as the L5 Society and the World Future Society [inboth of which Iheld academic-level membership].L5, named for the 5th Lagrangian libration point of gravitational equilibriumbetween Earthand the Moon, was thought to be the ideal location for a permanent human spacecolony. TheSociety, founded in 1975 just two months after the Temple of Set, took itsinspiration from thespace-colonial writings of Gerard K. O’Neill, most notably The High Frontier. Asat the sametime America’s new space shuttle was popularly regarded as the precursor toopenly-availablecivilian space transport, L5 seemed entirely reasonable and practical. [Twelveyears later thepolitical paranoia of the 1980s, with its militarization of the space shuttleand other space efforts,doomed L5. It disintegrated into the National Space Society 48 , an EarthboundNASA fan club,which it remains to this day. Like the decaying bride in Great Expectations, theNSS still speakswistfully about space colonization, but the excitement that it was really soonto happen is gone.]1975 also marked the revival of one of San Francisco’s most famousHaight-Ashbury era rockbands, the Jefferson Airplane - now, in synch with space, the JeffersonStarship. Like the Templeof Set, it seemed mesmerized by the significance and power of that year,celebrated in its songs48 http://www.nss.org- 54 -such as “Ride the Tiger” and “War Movie”. I had sent one of the thirty originalcopies of the Bookof Coming Forth by Night to the Starship’s Paul Kantner, commencing a friendshipandexchange-of-vision which has endured to this day. [Some sparks of this,originally published inthe Scroll of Set and Order of the Trapezoid’s Runes, etc. appear here asAppendix #9.]Over the Halloween weekend the first of what were to become a spectacular seriesofinternational conclaves of the Temple of Set was held in Santa Barbara, asrecounted in theDecember issue of the Scroll:Friday evening (Halloween): Those who had arrived by Friday evening were treatedto dinnerand a reception at our High Priest’s home. Wall certificates were presented tothose who attended.Those who were not present Friday evening were invited to lunch with the HighPriest onSaturday, and received wall certificates at that time.Saturday afternoon (November 1): The highlight of the discussion period was thepresentationof the final papers which make the Temple of Set a nonprofit, tax-exemptCalifornia religiouscorporation. The High Priest explained that federal tax-exempt status should nowbe easilyobtained.Also of note during this session was the choosing by lot of the terms of officeof the Council ofNine, which are as follows: Priest Thomas S. Huddleston - 9 years, Priest RonaldK. Barrett - 8years, Magistra Lilith Sinclair - 7 years, Priest Amn DeCecco - 6 years,Priestess Jinni Bast - 5years - Magister Michael A. Grumboski - 4 years, Magister Robert Ethel - 3years, Magister L. DaleSeago - 2 years, and Magistra Margaret Wendall - 1 year. It must be noted thatthese people do notautomatically leave the Council at the end of these terms. They will bereconsidered at that time. Iftheir continued service on the Council will benefit the Temple of Set, they willserve another nineyear term.Saturday evening (November 1): The Conclave Banquet was held at Squire Richard’sPub in atruly Old English setting, with “wenches” serving table and a minstrel who sangto us.Saturday evening Ritual (November 1): The Conclave Ritual was held at 11 PM. Aspecially-made candelabra, with a candle representing each degree of membership in theTemple of Set, waslit. Those members of the Council of Nine who attended were presented withinsignia of office( Tcham scepters handcrafted by Priest Murray). The highlight, however, was thepresentation tothe High Priest of a sword, the Double Crown, and a crook and flail.Sunday morning (November 2): Breakfast at Squire Richard’s Pub at what must beone of theminor disasters of Santa Barbara history! Each person ordered somethingdifferent, and a fuseblew, throwing the toaster, the coffee maker (and probably the cook) out oforder for awhile. Allfelt the waitresses could have charged us an “entertainment tax” for the waythey kept theircomposure and even joked with us about the breakdown “we” had caused.Much important business was accomplished; Setians who had been correspondingwith eachother for a long time had a chance to meet face-to-face. New friendships wereformed, and all whoattended left with a feeling that the Temple of Set is truly a Brotherhood.Thanks are due first to Magistra Sinclair, who coordinated the conclave; to theHigh Priest,who so graciously opened his home to us; to Priest Murray for the rite observedand long hoursmaking the candelabra, pentagram and insignia; to the motel personnel who madethe staypleasant; and to the staff of Squire Richard’s who made our meals together mostenjoyable.Among the topics of discussion and speculation at this initial conclave was themeaning of thefurther human evolution as implied by the Book of Coming Forth by Night. Wasthis to beunderstood and interpreted as a purely initiatory development of consciousness,or as a physicalchange of some sort, or as a species-migration phenomenon [as into space]? Untilwe resolvedthis, Setians decided to look into all three options. On the South Solstice of1975, I sent thePriesthood my thoughts on the issue: Setamorphosis [Appendix #10].Setians responded very positively to this rather extraordinary prospectus,indeed more sothan I had frankly anticipated. By the Vernal Equinox of 1976 there had beensuch a flurry oforganizational developments, to say nothing of brainstorming, that it was timefor an update,and so I sent the Priesthood Setamorphosis II [Appendix #11].- 55 -Looking back on these documents and the escapist-fantastic visions they express,it mayseem, from a perspective thirty years later, that the Temple of Set was off to aspacecrazed start.Well, it simply did not seem that way in the mid-1970s. Public access to space,consequent to thesuccessful invention of the space shuttle and the appearance of severalnon-governmental spacecompanies such as the West German OTRAG, seemed both practical and excitinglyimminent.And the prolific, space-colonization literature lent serious depth to suchspeculations generally.2001: A Space Odyssey, with a Hilton Hotel on its spectacular space wheel, wasjust around thecorner - inevitably a site for a future Setian conclave! [Such dreams,incidentally, have persistedto this day among the more visionary elements of humanity, resulting in effortssuch as SpaceAdventures Ltd. (http://www.spaceadventures.com). We may have that orbital/Lunarconclaveyet!But in 1976, while we waited for OTRAG to start selling tickets, the Temple hadotherconcerns and interests here on Earth. We had by now completed most of theoriginaladministrative tasks - elegant fire-enameled Pentagram of Set medallions fromthe Wolf-BrownCompany, courtesy of Setian Robert Moffatt; public information/membershipbrochures; adazzling 3D-effect membership card created by Bill Murray, etc.The Scroll of Set was purring along monthly, under Magistra Wendall’sEditorship, ablyassisted by Priest Michael Waters, Adept Alan Sturrock, and Setian PatriciaTurner of theBubastis Pylon in San Jose, California. Content was kaleidoscopic: Setian yoga,religious/legalissues, ritual magical theory, poetry, Egyptian studies, personal artwork, bookreviews, reportsfrom various officials, conclave invitations and summaries, comparisons ofSetian philosophywith that of other occult systems, and even a commentary on the AmericanBicentennialcelebration and its nation-touring “Freedom Train”. Honorary Setian Forrest JAckermancontributed an article explaining why he ever got started collecting sciencefiction.Concerning the more permanent literature of the Temple, there was initialconsensus that itshould be private to the membership, not commercially published like the SatanicBible andRituals. One of the more famous repositories-of-wisdom in traditional occultismhad been themythical Emerald Tablet of Thoth, so why not a Ruby Tablet of Set [reflectinghis totem-color]in reality? Magister Robert Ethel volunteered to undertake it as a project.Eventually the RubyTablet would become the II°+ component of an entire Jeweled Tablets of Setseries, extendingfrom the Crystal Tablet of the I°+ to the Topaz Tablet of the VI°.As of July 1976, presented at the First Eastern Conclave of the Temple inWashington, D.C.,Ethel’s original draft of the Ruby Tablet was 41 pages long. Today it hasmushroomed into themulti-thousands, to the point where it can only be Internet/CD-based. Prior tothe arrival of theInternet, Adepts ordering the RT would be startled to see a huge stack of fatred binders awaitingthem at the post office or conclave.Beyond the Temple’s internal literature, of course, there was a good deal ofinformation ofinterest to us in the commercially-published realm. A Reading List seemed like agood idea, andI took that job on myself; I would keep it until 2003.Since joining the Church of Satan in 1969, I had become a voracious occult- andoutré-bookdevourer and collector. My bookshelves overflowed into my closets, and themakeshift shelvestherein were ultimately packed three-deep with the Good, the Bad, and theArguable. This wasboth useful and problematic for a Temple of Set Reading List. Useful becauseover the years Ihad pretty much zeroed in on the best stuff. Problematic because some of thatbest stuff wasn’treadily available in normal bookstores, or was comparatively expensive when itwas. In my RLintroduction, accordingly, I encouraged Setians to make the acquaintance ofold-book stores,book-search services, and the interlibrary loan services of community anduniversity libraries.Back then that took a good deal more dedication, perseverance, and time thantoday’s instantInternet quests!- 56 -The categories of the Reading List upon which I decided reflected the wide rangeof interestsof the Temple of Set. They have remained unchanged in the subsequent threedecades, exceptthat I and others have added some items and - following the revival of the Orderof the Trapezoid- a category on the ancient north European runic arts & sciences was created.The Reading List appears herein as Appendix #12. Within the context of thismemoir I amincluding it as one of the best ways to illustrate both the wide-ranginginterests of the Templeand the focus & depth of resultant investigations. [Note also that passages ofthis narrative, andwithin various other Appendices, make reference to Reading List entries by theircode number.]By now it can be seen that the Temple of Set’s approach to individualinitiation, as well as toits own identity as the Temple of Set, was far more multifaceted than mostnonSetians [andmany shellshocked new Setians] appreciated. As can be seen from the contents ofthe JeweledTablets, the collected issues of the Scroll of Set, and the numerous papers ofthe Temple’sOrders, Elements, Pylons, and individual Initiates, the Reading List wasappropriately a point ofdeparture, not an end in itself.That departure was made easier by Priest Ronald K. Barrett and his Anubis Pylonin SanFrancisco, who inaugurated the Ap-uat Library Project (ALP) to further identify,track down, andeither acquire or otherwise make available to Setians for specialized learningand research.Wrote Barrett in the October 1976 Scroll:The Anubis Pylon has been organizing a new element for the Temple of Set whichincludesbook research, data bank, and experimentation coordination. This new element isdesigned toassist individual Setians, pylons, and other elements by collecting andproviding information thatwill save footwork, effort, and time.Starting 1 October Xl ALP will be able to provide upon request book lists bysubject matter orauthor which may include [but not be limited to] the High Priest’s reading list.These book lists arefor informational purposes only and will not carry a recommendation. Bookreviews sent to ALPby members of the Temple will be included in the ALP Newsletter.It will also be possible to order some books directly from ALP, as somepublishers are offeringdiscounts to the Temple. Magistra Sinclair in Santa Barbara will be in charge ofthe book orders,but all orders must be sent initially to ALP in San Francisco for processing andpaid in advance.Details will be provided in the newsletter, as they are too involved to includehere.Another function of ALP is assistance in coordinating research and experimentsby recordingwho has knowledge of what, who is doing what, who wants to research what, whocan help whom,etc. The effectiveness of this depends equally upon the input and output ofinformation. You willgreatly enhance the potential of this program by writing out your answers to thequestionnairebelow and mailing them in to ALP. All answers will be kept confidential, andonly your names andinterests will be used for referrals.The newsletter mentioned above will be a summary of accumulated general data,bookreviews, special reports and articles, etc. There will be no regular publishingdate for thenewsletter - neither will there be a standard rate of subscription. The pricewill be based on 10cents/page and announced in the Scroll when each new issue is ready. The firstissue is now inprocess and should be available around November 1st.Send any inquiries, requests, book reviews, comments, etc., and your answers tothequestionnaire to Priest Ronald K.

During its lifetime, by contrast, theChurch of Satan hadexperienced roughly a 50% annual turnover rate. 49Despite all of the organizational work, Setians actually found some time to justget togetherfor socializing, dining, and even a little Black Magic. Over the South Solstice1976 weekend inDecember, for instance, another conclave was held in San Jose, hosted by theBubastis Pylon. Avery pleasant day was devoted to touring the Rosicrucian Park headquarters ofthe AMORC, aremarkable complex of ancient Egyptian architecture, somewhat incongruouslyright in themidst of residential neighborhoods.At this time the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art had also negotiated themostimpressive exhibition of artifacts from Pharaoh Tutankhamen’s tomb ever to tourthe UnitedStates. As it traveled around the country to various museums, groups of Setiansmet to attendand admire it. For those who for reasons of budget or distance could not visitthe Tut Show inperson, the Temple of Set purchased and circulated gratis a complete set ofcolor slides of all theexhibit artifacts, along with an audio narrative of them by the MetropolitanMuseum’s Director.Somewhat less successful, commencing in mid-1976 and continuing for the nextyear (as bestI can make out from the documents in question) was one of the Temple of Set’stwo comicpratfalls in its ancient Egyptian explorations. Magistra Margaret Wendall, adevotee of Egypt’scalendar, proposed that the Temple of Set adopt it instead of the conventionalGregorian one.Well, why not? It sounded like fun, and might have the added benefit of keepingnonSetians inthe dark about the scheduling of Temple events.Unfortunately the new/old system of days and months (“7 Pharmuthi XXI”) alsomanaged toconfuse all of us to the extent that we didn’t know what was happening wheneither! Somemonths later - however long it really was no one knows for certain - we slunkgrouchily back intoGregoriana.At one of our first conclaves we also experimented with Egyptian eye-makeup -the heavy,black extended outlines that one sees on ancient statues, wall-reliefs, andHollywood monstermovies. As part of a total appearance makeover, I daresay, it might lookimpressive. Mixed withany elements of modern attire, mustaches & beards, Afro- or other 1970s-hairdos, 5 o’clockshadows, etc., the effect was beyond hilarious. [I will give the Setian ladiescredit for doing abetter job of their makeup, but of course they had a head start (no punintended).] Only a fewslapstick photos have survived, and no, one is not going to be included in thePlates section ofthis memoir! Well, maybe ...49 Aquino, M.A., Priesthood Letter #III°-22, 9/8/76.- 58 -[index-59_1.jpg][index-59_2.jpg]- 59 -6: Jackal RisingBrien’s First Law: At some time in the life cycle of virtually everyorganization, its abilityto succeed in spite of itself runs out.Brontosaurus Principle: Organizations can grow faster than their brains canmanagethem in relation to their environment and to their own physiology; when thisoccurs,they are an endangered species.From its very beginning the Temple of Set was much more than the extended visionand/orphilosophy of a single individual. Initially, of course, it consisted of thoseInitiates of the Churchof Satan who, like myself, had rejected Anton LaVey’s May 1975 decision tocommercialize theChurch; and who, after reading the Book of Coming Forth by Night, had decidedthat theconcept and orientation of the Temple of Set resonated with them.Such resonance took as many different forms as there were individuals.• Some saw the Temple as essentially a continuation of the previous Church’sSatanism,albeit re-tinted to ancient Egyptian hues.• Some saw it as a rejection of Satanism altogether in favor of a reach-back toancientEgyptian mythology and philosophy.• Some saw it as an entirely new vision of the future, borrowing only suchtrappingsfrom Satanism and/or ancient Egypt as might be useful or artistic forillustrativepurposes.• Still others had no preconceptions or agendæ, and were content to letwhatever-this-thing-might-be just simmer in the frying pan until it began to smell and tastegood.This heterogeneous, collegial, unhurried, and pleasant atmosphere set the tonefor what theTemple of Set would generally continue to be to the present day, and I thinkgoes a long waytowards explaining why it has not fallen victim to either Brien’s First Law orthe BrontosaurusPrinciple. Where the Temple has occasionally sailed through rough seas hasusually resultedfrom, or at least been catalyzed by some individual’s or group’s desire tocreate a narrower, moreuniform focus. Such ambitions have generally arisen with the best of intentions:a wish toenergize the Temple more, to see all Setians of all degrees as exemplars ofexcellence, to- 60 -accentuate the Temple as an occult institution or as a social presence.Unfortunately for suchcrusaders, yet I think fortunately for the Temple’s underlying authenticity andsubstance, effortsto marshal Setians are rather akin to herding cats.The first year in particular of the Temple was marked by regular and abundantdialogueamong the founding Masters and Priests as to just how this new approach toinitiation could bedefined, measured, evaluated, and administered. An entirely freeform, anarchicapproach wouldrender any kind of collective degree-system confusing at best, incoherent andmeaningless atworst. It was easy enough to establish ordered procedures for initiatorydegree-recognitions;the hard part was ensuring a standard of integrity and quality whereby an Adept,say,recognized for demonstrated competence in one “universe of interests” could beseen on a parwith another of quite different experience and abilities.Indeed the five original Masters of the Temple exemplified such divergentperspectives:Margaret Wendall was a practical, no-nonsense personality with interests inscientificfields such as modern & ancient astronomy, [the then fledgling field of]personalcomputers, and medieval Russian mythology. Throughout the years of the Church ofSatan, she had gained a national reputation for being among the most stable,levelheaded, and rational of the Priesthood. Her Bubastis Chapel in San Jose wassimilarly mature, tranquil, and commonsensible, as was her long-runningnewsletterThe Magic Cat. In 1975 she promptly volunteered her editorial and professional-layout skills for the creation of the Temple’s Scroll of Set newsletter,establishing astandard of excellence and æsthetics for that publication which has continuedeversince.Robert Ethel of Washington, D.C. was a charming, ebullient artist whose AsmodeusGrotto had attracted Satanists of a similarly eccentric, bohemian verve. He wasalso aseasoned and widely-read occultist of “the old school”, whose opinions andjudgmentsreflected what he saw as the best mixture of many approaches to wisdom. Anichthyologist and owner of his own aquarium business, his home was almost asexoticas Anton LaVey’s, presided over by his gorgeous white cockatoo.Michael Grumboski of Detroit had come to national notice in the Church of Satanbybeing a strong advocate for integrity and “constructive repair” in first theWayneWest/Babylon Grotto and then the John DeHaven/Stygian Grotto crises [see myChurch of Satan]. Looking rather quaintly like Walt Disney’s Ichabod Crane,“Shai”was modest, unassuming, and invariably polite-to-a-fault. He shared MargaretWendall’s interest in computers, though on mainframe instead of personalhardware.L. Dale Seago, most recently of Los Angeles, was the adventurer of the group.Previouslya Marine Corps noncommissioned officer in North Carolina and a martial artsBlackBelt, he had moved first to Texas, then to Los Angeles, where his Yuggoth Grottohadattracted a colorful collection of old-guard Church-of-Satanists as well asavant-gardeartists, entertainers, and magicians. Strongly principled and fiercely loyal tocausesthat inspired him, he moved to Santa Barbara shortly after the Temple’s foundingtocomplete a Master’s degree in Political Science from the University ofCalifornia, alongwith a commission as a Military Intelligence officer in the U.S. Army. Hisessays aboutthe more complex issues and applications of Black Magic in the Scroll couldalways becounted upon to raise the bar of research precision and intellectual excellence.- 61 -Lilith Sinclair had soared to prominence as the darkly-beautiful and fieryPriestess ofNew York City’s Lilith Grotto, famous both for her Grotto’s dramatic activitiesandcommunity presence and for her own public personification of the Church ofSatan,which had led one Pennsylvania cultural magazine to dub her “the occultsuperstar ofthe east”. Moving to Santa Barbara in the early 1970s, she had gone on to becomeamajor national influence in the Church, particularly in its developinginter-Grotto andregional programs. She brought to the Temple of Set a deeply intuitive andromanticconviction that invariably lent a richness and depth to what could otherwisehave beena rather too-cerebral atmosphere.Individually and cooperatively these founding Masters established a climate ofencouragement of and respect for personal idiosyncrasy in Setian initiation.They proved that itwas indeed possible to have widely-alien talents, interests, accomplishments,yet respect oneanother fully and sincerely. In this Setians of today owe a debt to theseoriginal Masters that canscarcely be overstated.Quickly emerging in this rich new garden of initiation were the initial Priestsand Priestessesof Set. As in the old Church, these individuals were at the nerve center of allinteractivitybetween the Temple as an institution and the I°/II° membership. Each Priest,each Priestessbecame in effect the “personification” of the Temple of Set to these affiliates.They were livingexamples of what it really meant to come into being as an awakened child of Set.Easily the most well-known and flamboyant was William F. Murray of Winnemucca,Nevada,whose affable gregariousness throughout the Church of Satan had first amused,then alarmedthe LaVeys. In designing the Temple of Set, I had created the office ofExecutive Director as chiefadministrative officer, to complement and counterbalance the High Priest aschief executiveofficer. Bill slipped into the EDship as naturally and effortlessly as though itwere an old pair ofLevis. He quickly organized, delegated, and coordinated the Temple’s severalorganizationalservices: publications, records, communication networks, finances, calendars,and programs. Allthis from a modest little white house in Winnemucca, itself a modest little waystop in the middleof the Nevada desert. Indeed a local visitor to Bill’s house would have noticednothingunremarkable about its Norman Rockwell-homespun decor - unless he happened to beinvitedinto the basement, where the Twilight Zone prevailed: the ED office, abewildering workshop ofimplements and artifacts from the mundane to the Lovecraftian, and a ritualchamber with thegreatest and wildest assortment of electronic and mechanical special effects Ihave ever seen. IfPriest Beauclerk of Carpathia (Bill’s magical persona) needed the clash of agong or a lightning-flash outside the [artificial] window, the flick of a hidden solenoid switchbeneath the arm of histhrone sufficed.By day Bill was a welfare investigator for the State of Nevada, crisscrossingthe desert,scattered small towns, and Indian reservations in his bright yellow Volkswagen“Thing” (arecreation of the World War II Wehrmacht Kübelwagen). Unsurprisingly his visitswere notalways welcome; he was regularly shot at, as was his house. In time-honoredNevada tradition, Igather that the aim was always deliberately high so as not to actually hurtanyone. As previouslymentioned, Winnemucca’s principal landmark and major claim to fame remained aplaque infront of its sole bank proudly commemorating that Butch Cassidy and his WildBunch hadrobbed it in 1900.Priest Robert “Jzamon” DeCecco was a cheerful Italian living in Boston,Massachusetts,whose Amon Pylon became the focus of Setian activity in New England as had itsSatanicpredecessor the Cavern of Amon. Warm, hospitable, and dashing, Jzamon would goon to anenduring presence throughout the Temple as a later Master and member of theCouncil of Nine.- 62 -Dayton, Ohio was home to Priest Thomas and Priestess Colleen Huddleston, alsoChurchveterans, and well-known throughout the Temple for Tom’s experiments withunusual andremarkable musical instruments such as the thermion and the moog. Colleen was atalentedpainter, whose Setian portraits, composites, and Tarot cards quickly becamelegendary, and thetwo of them collaborated in magnificent illuminated calligraphy as well, whichthey brought tobear upon various ritual working documents and records.Priestess Jinni Bast of New Jersey and Priest Tom Bari of Pennsylvania were bothalumni ofNew York’s old Lilith Grotto. They went on to introduce the Temple of Set intheir respectivelocales, and Jinni served several years as a member of the Council of Nine.But easily the most dramatic, charismatic, and creative of the original Priestsof Set wasRonald K. Barrett, who a short time before the 1975 disintegration of the Churchof Satan hadmoved from New York City, where he had been a principal personality in theLilith Grotto, toSan Francisco. There he founded his own [aptly-named, as it turned out, beingthe final Grotto ofthe Church] Twilight Grotto, which in 1975 became the Anubis Pylon of the Templeof Set.Ron, or “Anubis” as everyone came to call him, looked as though he had steppedright out of aFrank Frazetta poster: lean, muscular, with a Mephistophelian face that couldinstantly switchbetween horror-movie glower and friendly laughter. If the LaVeys had feared BillMurray for hisroughshod-overrunning of communications barriers, they disliked Barrett -particularly once hearrived in San Francisco - for possibly another reason: he was easily aspersonable, dramatic,and artistically talented a Satanist as Anton himself.In the new environment of the Temple of Set, Anubis established an earlyreputation as oneof the most serious and dedicated scholars of Egyptian initiation. Introduced toIsha Schwallerde Lubicz’ Her-Bak by two of his Adepts, Lindajean Parrinello (later Reynolds)and AlexandraSarris, he quickly became focused upon Isha’s and her husband Rene’s “symbolism”approach asthe most accurate and effective key to Egyptology, and delved into its studywith the same energythat characterized all of his passions.Most original Setians, as in their Church of Satan past, “didn’t give up theirday jobs” whilepursuing their initiation. We had all become accustomed to, experienced in, andadmittedlyresigned to balancing dual identities as ordinary “working stiffs” inconventional society and asInitiates among our fellows behind the closed doors of the sanctuary. Not soRonald K. Barrett:His journey was complete, uncompromised, and all-consuming. If that meant thathe lived inisolation and near-poverty, so be it. Perhaps no occultist since AleisterCrowley’s teacher andBuddhist monk Allan Bennett has exuded such a singular, pure, and drivendedication toachieving his divinity. And, ultimately, he almost did it.In this the Temple of Set both aided and impeded him. It opened unlimited vistasbefore himand encouraged him to ravish himself within them; simultaneously it frustratedhis desire totake others with him into what was necessarily a unique and personal experience.A BlackMagician par excellence he was; a herder of cats he discovered he was not.Within a year after the Temple’s founding, Barrett decided that the “aridwilderness of steeland stone” that was San Francisco was woefully inadequate for the initiatoryenvironment hedeemed essential for himself and his students. He and his companion Adept RiccoZappitellilooked around for a suitably sacred site and found it atop a wild mountain nearthe northernCalifornia town of Potter Valley. XemSet he named the small plot of land theybought there, andover the next several years, and with the added arms, backs, and perspiration ofvisiting/volunteering Setians, gradually began to carve it into a magical sanctuary.There was a smallcabin for themselves and visitors; there were outdoor meditation areas; therewas a winding pathup the hill to a hidden ceremonial court suitable for nighttime pageants andmagical workingsunder the stars. Far away from the lights of any city, enveloped by the uttersilence of thebackwoods, XemSet was indeed a beautiful and magical place, wherein very littleof humancraft- 63 -was either needed or wanted. Nevertheless the tireless Barrett continued toaccent it withthrones, standards, portals, and altars, all hand wrought and exquisitelypainted.Barrett devoted no less attention to his personal ceremonial and religiousattire, which againwas all handcrafted to the admiration of other Setians. And at least once withslapstick results:After being Recognized as a Master of the Temple in August 1977, he proudlyarrived at aPriesthood dinner in San Jose wearing the blue clerical collar insert to whichhe was nowentitled. Except that he had accented it with blue glitter. Bill Murray glancedat the sparklingitem, swished over to him, shook his hand limply, and in his bestdrag-queen-caricature lispgushed, “Ron - it’s just you!” The meeting exploded in laughter, and so, afterfirst going beet-red, did the new Master of the Temple.New Setians continued to enter the Temple in a steady stream, and predominantlythese werenow individuals who were not long-term Church of Satan alumni. They were on thewhole notinterested in that organization or in Satanism per se; they were attractedpurely to the messageand invitation of the Temple of Set, which they saw as a darker, more glamorousand seriousalternative to the numerous fluffy-bunny occultisms that had proliferated in theNew Ageatmosphere of the 1970s. These newcomers didn’t arrive with blank, gullibleminds; they werealready hardened philosophers who had put conventional wisdom to the test andfound itinadequate to deal with the greater realities of existence they had come toconfront.This “second generation” of Setians took the Temple of Set not on its terms, andnot on thecoattails of any lingering Church of Satan momentum, but on a pragmatic basis.If it proved toindeed facilitate their personal adventure into the Mysteries, they would staywith it. If not, theywould continue their search elsewhere.This rationale was respected, indeed cultivated by the Temple itself, whichgraduallyconfigured its I° entry degree into what Her-Bak termed a “peristyle” or“courtyard” of mutualacquaintance and evaluation. New Setians I° were given a maximum of two years toqualify forRecognition as Adepts II°; if they did not meet this deadline, their affiliationwas discontinued.Two years was not only plenty of time for a reasonably-intelligent individual todevelop basicBlack Magical skills (which II° Recognition signified); it was also amplysufficient for nonSetiansto realize that they were in an incomprehensible or otherwise unsatisfactoryenvironment andthus leave on their own. [This is a policy which the Temple has continued to thepresent day,generally with mutual benefit.]In contemplating this memoir I have wondered how best to remember and illustratetheintellectual, initiatory, and organizational contributions and influence ofthose Setians in ourearly years who shaped the Temple’s design, outlook, and overall flavor. I couldcite personalmemories and anecdotes, of course, but this would be necessarily subjective andselective. WhatI have decided to do instead is to append a selection of representative articlesfrom the Temple’sScroll of Set newsletter. These will appear as appendices, and are groupedtherein correspondingto the chapter(s) of this memoir to which they align in time. See from thesefounding yearsAppendices #14-46.During these same four years I myself was driven by two primary interests wherethe Templewas concerned: first to design and shape it into the most interesting,efficient, and above allauthentic Temple of Set I could envision; and second to complete the Utteranceof my WordXeper. By 1979 I felt that I had accomplished both. The Temple had its Articlesof Incorporation,By-Laws, and federal & California state recognitions as a religious institution.The otherfounding members, most essentially the Magistry and the Priesthood, understoodhow tooperate this machinery smoothly and cooperatively; everyone was enjoying theTemple andinitiatorily profiting from exposure to it.Where Xeper was concerned, I felt that from my research into both its ancientEgyptianmeaning and its modern evolutionary implications, I had indeed explained it bothto myself and- 64 -to others. In my personal case this culminated in my Ipsissimus initiation asrecounted in theprevious chapter. In the case of other Setians, the influence of Xeper waswonderfully apparentin the strength and diversity of the talent and genius the Temple was clearlyawakening in them[of which the aforementioned Scroll articles are just one example].One of my core concerns was that the Temple of Set establish and maintain itsorganizationalidentity beyond any individual; it was not to become a “personality cult” ofmyself or anyoneelse. Further, its focus necessarily needed to be on each initiate’s experience,not on theinstitution itself. Hence my often-invoked metaphor of the Temple of Set as“merely a toolbox”whose tools were available to each Setian to assist in his own, uniqueinitiatory adventure.In keeping with this, I felt that it was important for the High Priesthood ofSet to beestablished as an office to be held by whichever Setian seemed to be mostattuned to it at anyparticular time. It should not be a lifetime enshrining of any person, as forinstance the RomanCatholic Papacy or Anton LaVey’s Satanic High Priesthood.Thus in 1979 the time appeared right to commence this tradition, and it seemedto me thatthe appropriate combination of dedication, energy, vision, and responsibilitywas mostconspicuously coalescent in Ronald K. Barrett, as is apparent from abiographical profile of himin the May 1979 issue of the Scroll of Set (Appendix #46). Just as importantly,his own initiationhad taken the momentous step of transition from Magister Templi IV° to Magus V°.On June 22, XII/1977 then-Priest Barrett had performed a GBM working atop hismountaintop retreat which resulted in his awareness of and subsequent focus uponthe Egyptianhieroglyphic term Xem (the Xem Working: Appendix #47). In a 11/22/78 letter tothe Priesthoodof Set I said:In III°-65 I mentioned, among other things, that I had some further thinking todo about theritual held in San Francisco this past spring. At that ritual Magister Ronald K.Barrett formallyproposed a new concept embraced by the word Xem, roughly as follows:Xem historically has been associated with the ancient Egyptians’ identificationof theirgeographical territory, in much the same way as we use the terms “England”,“France”, etc. Barrettsuggests that this use of Xem is erroneous - that in fact it encompasses a farmore complexphenomenon. Xem as understood by Barrett refers to the collective initiatoryenvironment of theancient priesthoods - sort of a “boundary of higher consciousness” rather than apolitical/geographical border in the profane sense. Xem may have come into vulgar usage asa political/geographic term, of course, and that would account for its subsequenttranslation byarchæologists.But, continues Barrett, Xem possesses additional significance. It is subject toanothertranslation: “the Coming Into Being of the gods”. In this sense it refers to“gods” in the precisesense as “Forms” - derived not from the governing principles of the mechanicalcosmos, but from“expansions” and “specializations”, one might say, of the primal non-naturalForm of Set.This, suggests Barrett, would account for the actual origin of the ancientEgyptian gods otherthan Set [and perhaps other than HarWer, and other than corrupted, imported godssuch asOsiris]. It is not so such that the earliest initiates of the Set-cult “fellaway” from that cult toworship natural-animal-headed conventional gods, but rather that certaininitiates were able touse their conceptual powers to create other Forms emphasizing certaincharacteristics. [Thiswould explain the somewhat mystifying statement in the Book of Coming Forth byNight that “allother gods have been created by men”.]The perfected magician, then, actualizes his or her perfection by the magicalact ofcreating a god or goddess. Presumably there are various ways in which this maybeundertaken. The act of creation may be metaphorical (i.e. the definition orintroduction of anevolutionary principle) or it may be actual (i.e. the magical genesis of a“higher self” possessingthe will and the characteristics of the god/goddess ... for example Aiwass,Aleister Crowley’s“higher self”/ “Holy Guardian Angel”).Magister Barrett had been considering aspects of this theory for some time priorto the springconclave in San Francisco. I can recall his discussing the basic concept with meduring some of my- 65 -first visits to the Anubis Pylon headquarters in S.F. after the crisis events of1975 had brought anew focus upon and interest in the “gods of Egypt”. What happened at the spring1978 conclavewas actually twofold: First Barrett felt that the hypothesis had beensufficiently developed to meritits being formally enunciated as a comprehensive theory, and secondly themagical workings ofthe conclave ritual seemed to substantiate, if not altogether confirm thetheory.A west coast III°+ meeting was scheduled for 11/11-12 in San Francisco andOakland. A fewdays prior to the meeting, Barrett inquired if he could meet with me in SantaBarbara to discussan urgent matter. He was, as it turned out, “obsessed” with the theory, feelinga consuming needto explain it and promulgate it. He asked my interpretation of this obsessionand my adviceconcerning it.I suggested to him that the elements of his theory, the dynamic essence of hisUtterance of theWord Xem, and his compulsion to implement that Word were characteristics of aMagus V°.Consider the following quote from Aleister Crowley’s Magick:The essential characteristic of the Grade is that its possessor utters aCreative MagicalWord, which transforms the planet on which he lives by the installation of newofficers topreside over its initiation. This can take place only at an “Equinox of theGods” at the endof an “Æon”; that is, when the secret formula which expresses the Law of itsactionbecomes outworn and useless to its further development ...This does not mean that only one man can attain this Grade in any one Æon, sofar asthe Order is concerned. A man can make personal progress equivalent to that of a“Word ofan Æon”; but he will identify himself with the current word and exert his willto establishit, lest he conflict with the work of the Magus who uttered the Word of the Æonin whichhe is living.The Magus is preeminently the Master of Magick, that is, his will is entirelyfree frominternal diversion or external opposition; His work is to create a new Universeinaccordance with His Will. He is the Master of the Law of Change ( Anicca).Consider further this quote from Liber B vel Magi:Let Him beware of abstinence from action. For the Curse of His grade is that Hemustspeak Truth, that the Falsehood thereof may enslave the souls of men. Let HIMthen utterthat without fear, that the Law may be fulfilled. And according to His OriginalNature willthat law be shapen, so that one may declare gentleness and quietness, being anHindu; andanother fierceness and servility, being a Jew; and yet another ardour andmanliness, beingan Arab. Yet this matter toucheth the mystery of Incarnation, and is not here tobedeclared.Now the grade of a Magister teacheth the Mystery of Sorrow, and the grade of aMagusthe Mystery of Change, and the grade of Ipsissimus the Mystery of Selflessness,which isalso called the Mystery of Pan.Let the Magus then contemplate each in turn, raising it to the ultimate power ofinfinity. Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness isSelf. For theinterplay of the parts hath no action upon the whole. And this contemplationshall beperformed not by simple meditation - how much less then by reason? - but by themethodwhich shall have been given unto Him in His initiation to the Grade ...In ritual I explored Barrett’s state of being by means of the Fourth Æthyr ofThe Vision andThe Voice and by means of IV° analysis, for:By a Magus is this writing made known through the mind of a Magister. The oneuttereth clearly, and the other understandeth; yet the Word is falsehood, andtheUnderstanding darkness. And this saying is Of All Truth.Nevertheless it is written; for there be times of darkness, and this as a lamptherein.It was then evident to me that Ronald Barrett had in fact Come Into Being as aMagus V° inthe precise sense. He and I discussed some of the implications of this:- 66 -For one thing, it seemed that his V° was somewhere “in between” the alternativesdescribed byCrowley. His Word was more an evolution of Xeper than a destruction andreplacement of it. Soit did not seem to either of us that the Æon of Set was to be superseded, butrather that it was tocommence a more elaborate stage of development. Nor did Barrett's magicalprogress simplyequate to mine [per Crowley’s second alternative]; he was not merely identifyinghimself withXeper but rather Uttering a new Word containing implications beyond Xeper.Then there were issues bearing directly upon the Temple of Set. Per the By-Lawsa Magus V°must be confirmed as such by unanimous approval of the Council of Nine. Theintent of thisprovision, as with those relating to other degrees, was to establish orderlyanalysis of the degree-progress and to safeguard the degree-system against possible abuse.The defect of the V° provision, as is also the case with the IV° provision, isthat - at least in theTemple’s formative years - the Council of Nine includes III° as well as IV°Councillors. The IV° isdistinguished from the III° by [among other things] the quality of Understandingin a magicalsense ... being a sort of total awareness of the substance and implications of aWord. Hence a IV°Councillor may consider a IV° or V° nomination according to this sort ofawareness, while a III°Councillor considers the same question according to inductive/deductivereasoning, i.e.consideration of specific propositions and issues formulated during theCouncil’s discussion of thenomination.My original intention was to communicate my V° nomination for Barrett to theCouncil ofNine in advance of any general discussion within the III°+ as a whole. Thisnotion was preemptedby the events of the III°+ ritual at the 11/11-12 meeting in San Francisco,wherein Set came forthto declare the Coming Into Being of Barrett as a Magus.The events of that ritual have since been discussed by many of the Priesthoodwho were there,and so it seems appropriate to make the formal nomination of Ronald K. Barrettfor the V° to theCouncil per this III° letter. Perhaps this is also correct from a magicalstandpoint, since theconfirmation of a Magus is a development which will have a major impact upon theentirePriesthood and Temple of Set.How may the Council evaluate such a nomination? The salient characteristics of aMagus havebeen defined both here and in other documents of the Temple - such as the “Bookof ComingForth by Night Analysis & Commentary”. Concerning the 11/11 ritual, Councillorsmay wish to askthe impressions of those who were present: Seago, Sinclair, Sarris, Reynolds,Thomas, Waters,Moffatt, and Zappitelli. And of course the comments of Barrett himself may besought by anyCouncillor who wishes to do so. [I understand that Barrett will be preparing astatement of hisown for consideration by the Council.]Unquestionably this is an event of major importance for the Temple and for theÆon. It is alsothe first occasion on which we have been able to use the deliberative processesfor a V° evaluationestablished under our By-Laws. I am looking forward with the utmost interest tothe outcome.On the South Solstice of 1978 the Council of Nine voted its unanimous approvalof Barrett’sRecognition as a Magus V°. During the following year he refined his Word into aseries of five“Keys” comprising what he entitled the Book of Opening the Way (Appendices#48-52). Despitethis effort, Xem would continue to be criticized for its vagueness as a magicalconcept, though itsessential meaning never seemed all that mysterious [or impractical] to me(Appendix #53).As discussed in Chapter #5, it was subsequent to the 11/11/78 Priesthood workingthat I cameto realize that my own Task as a Magus had been fulfilled, and that finalinitiation to the as-yet-nonformalized degree of Ipsissimus now faced me. Simultaneously came aconviction that bothBarrett’s V° Task and my henceforth initiatory focus necessitated the conveyanceof the HighPriesthood of Set. On the Ides of March 1979, when I took the Oath ofIpsissimus, I wrote to thePriesthood:From Magus Ronald K. Barrett I have just received a copy of the first two Keysof the Book ofOpening the Way. I have considered them carefully and would now like to share mythoughts withthe Priesthood of Set.From an account by Priestesses Linda Reynolds and Alexandra Sarris of theWorking ofNovember 11, 1978:- 67 -Magus Aquino raised his hood and moved before the pentagram, then turned to thePriesthood. Before he spoke, it was clear to all that Set had manifested himselfin his HighPriest and Magus. In fact Magus Aquino’s face was no longer apparent - there wasadarkness within the cowl [later Anubis said that he saw a brief somethingchanging within,but wasn't sure what]. He turned and very slowly looked at every one of thePriesthood.Set: “Never before have I stood in the midst of such majesty. The majesty oftheseyoung gods and goddesses. You are the Children of Set ... [and he listed thenames]. I havelived through the pain of the Æon of Horus, and the pain and pleasure of the Ageof Satan,and this is my Æon ... has passed - a bridge ... For my Temple that was dust (?)is dormant(?) no longer. Before me I see the Black Jackal, he who has opened the way forme ... andfrom the desert ... he who lurked ... And I have raised him up so that all maysee.”What we can remember is the gist of what was said: that first Set spoke as Setandtalked about the æons and the Coming Into Being of Anubis, who was the Opener oftheWay, and hinted at the coming of something more ...But it was Ra-en-Set who proclaimed the words that he would nominate Ronald K.Barrett to the Council of Nine as Magus V°. And the new Word is Xem. He alsosaid that“the body is weary” and swayed perilously as if he would fall. “My limbs arebrought backtogether and I am made whole ...” He was supported immediately by NeXbet andSesheta,who created a circle of energy around him. As he spoke, the Priesthood stretchedout theirarms to send him energy, and then touched and hugged him with support, care, andgreatlove.When Set came to Anubis and put his hands around Anubis’ head and calledhim bythe name of Anubis, [he said]: “... What you have seen and what I have spoken... [areference to Xem] ... Upon your head, then, do I place my charge. Do not letwhat hashappened to them (the ancient Priesthood) happen again. Do not let Anubisminister tothe dead ...”Then Anubis spoke to the Priesthood: “Two lands ... invisible world ... world ofdarkness and the world of light ... Xem being fused ... the time of the greatfusion. It isrightly written that this is the time of the Coming Into Being of the gods ...”During the speech Medu felt the gathering of the entities to share in thisevent, andwithin their midst, like a pillar of black, was Set, sharing with his Childrenthis night.Anubis also had a sense of there being more than the Priesthood in the room. Healso felt asense of “Here we go ... again!”, and the feeling was optimistic - that after5,000 years wehave the chance to make it.Later Ra-en-Set said that if this be truth, let it be known. At that pointNeXbet sensedbefore her the grey lady of Maat with her feather, and NeXbet stepped forwardand said,“Give me your hand,” and Ra-en-Set raised his left hand. She took it and saidthat Maatwas before him and held a feather for him, for his words were true. ThenRa-en-Set andAnubis clasped hands and stared into one another’s eyes. Anubis had the distinctfeeling ofbeing able to speak to Magus Aquino - one Magus to another - on the big things -they havetheir own level of communication - like a father and grown-up son.And the scales were balanced.Anubis turned to the pentagram and said, “The gates have been opened, and theyshallnot be closed again!”I myself am not in a position to add to this account of that ritual, because mymind rejectsanalysis of it, just as it rejects analysis of other rituals in which Ra-en-SetCame Into Being. But Ido remember quite well the moment of placing my hands on the shoulders ofAnubis, because itwas as though some unique “energizing force” passed from myself to him.Since that time I have felt oddly “uneasy”, as though there were now a magicalimbalance inthe Temple of Set, and today, as I read the Keys of the Book of Opening the Way,I finallyUnderstood why.I quote from my letter to the II°+ membership of the Church of Satan(6/19/1975):The ancient Chinese once said that the Emperor obviously held the “Mandate ofHeaven” to retain his throne as long as all was well with the country. If thingswere notgoing well, it would be assumed that the Mandate had been lost, and thus itbecame- 68 -acceptable to replace the Emperor without insulting the throne or the country.As I employthe term, the “Infernal Mandate” is carried by whoever best represents the truewill of thePrince of Darkness at a given point of time. The new organization will bedesigned so thatit will be possible to reassign this Mandate where it is believed appropriatewithoutscrapping the entire organizational machinery.After reading and considering the initial Keys of the Book of Opening the Way, Iam convincedthat the “Infernal Mandate” has now passed. Accordingly I now formally requestthe Council ofNine to entrust the High Priesthood of Set to Magus Ronald K. Barrett. Xeper hasbeen Uttered,and it is now the time for the Coming Into Being of Xem.As High Priest since June of 1975, I have seen the Temple of Set grow frommagical andphilosophical infancy to become an institution the like of which has not beenknown on this planetsince the days of ancient Xem. We have explored the potential of our kind to analmostinconceivable degree, and we have Understood the forces of existence in thisuniverse with crystalclarity. We have taken the pitiful fragments of the ancient knowledge which cameto us throughthe crucible of the Age of Satan, and we have reforged them, like Siegfried'ssword, into theessence of their original power. We have also come to know one another withextraordinaryempathy, seeing past the vehicles of our Earthly flesh to the Black Flame thatburns within us. Allthese things and more we have done, and now they have brought us to this newOpening of theWay.What are my own feelings upon this realization? I sense only a quiet pleasure athaving, as IUnderstand it, fulfilled the Task given to me by the Book of Coming Forth byNight; and a greatanticipation concerning what will now Come Into Being. I will of course remainan active Initiateand will do what may be within my power to further the Æon; and no doubt youwill probablycontinue to be pestered from time to time with my singular opinions. But theimpetus of the Æonof Set is now in the care of another Magus. And so another magical questionseems to beanswered; for I suspect that the “nineteen parts of the Word” which eluded meare nowcommencing to Come Into Being as the Book of Opening the Way. 50To all of you, the Priesthood of Set, there are no words that I can say toexpress the love andrespect in which I hold you, as well as the honor it has been to serve as HighPriest. We shallUnderstand such things, I am certain, without further comment.I, Ra-en-Set, lift up my voice and swear that I myself have been brought hitherby Set, thePrince of Darkness. After that I had attained unto the Knowledge andConversation of him byvirtue of the Diabolicon, and of this Ritual that I bestow upon Setians myfellows, and most of hisgreat love that he beareth to me, yea, verily, he led me to the Age of Satan; hebade me fling awayall that I had and all that I was; and he forsook me in that Hour. But when Icame beyond the Ageof Satan, to be reborn on the North Solstice X, then came he unto me by the Bookof ComingForth by Night.Also he made me a Magus, speaking through Xeper, the Word of the new æon, theÆon of Set.Thus he fulfilled my will to bring full freedom to his Gifted race.Yea, he wrought also in me a work of wonder beyond this, but in this matter I assworn to holdmy peace. 51The Council of Nine and Priesthood of Set subsequently took up the question of aformal VI°within the initiatory structure of the Temple of Set, decided that it wasappropriate52 , andamended the By-Laws accordingly. Both the succession of the High Priesthood andmy formal50 In this I was mistaken on two counts: The Book of Opening the Way ceased withfive Keys, and I subsequentlyundertook and completed the Word of Set working based on John Dee’s original“Enochian” manuscripts.51 These last three paragraphs were inspired by a reflection of AleisterCrowley’s concerning his own “knowledge andconversation of his Holy Guardian Angel [Aiwass]” and the initiatory adventurewhich ultimately led him to his owninitiation as an Ipsissimus (10)=[1]. It is appended to Liber Samekh in the1973-restored edition of Magick.52 Insofar as the Understanding of the Masters of the Temple extends to theexistence, if not the essence ofIpsissimus.- 69 -VI° Recognition occurred at the Temple of Set’s first International Conclave(Set-1), held thatsummer as recounted in the August 1979 Scroll of Set:Set-I International Conclave is Accomplished- by Constance Moffatt II°“A major step in the evolution of the Temple of Set as a whole, something thathas been a longtime in the coming, something we all felt instinctively was vital, has beenaccomplished,” statedMagus Ronald K. Barrett, High Priest, during an interview following theconclusion of Set-I, heldin Windsor, Canada July 12-15, 1979.“A bond has been established in helping to connect all of the Elect so thatthere is noseparation of purpose and direction. In the two workings I felt a very strongdrive to unite theOrder of Set (III°+) with an essence that we all knew was there, but whengeographicallyseparated seems difficult at times to feel,” continued Magus Barrett. “Duringthe Conclaveworking there was a new bond of understanding extended from the Order of Set tothe laymembership. The obvious advantages of the Conclave are the getting to know thedifferentInitiates on an individual basis. Thus when we see a name in the Scroll or incorrespondence, wecan connect the essence of the individual to that name. A deeper sense of trustand love, that couldnot have occurred by any other means than the Conclave, has begun due to thepersonal contactand interrelations with our Setian brothers and sisters.“Another major advantage of the Conclave is the fact that we have witnessed theTemple of Setfunction on both its administrative and magical raison d’etre. The laymembership has been ableto see the various aspects of the Order of Set in motion, such as the Council ofNine and the HighPriest determining policy change in keeping with the growth of the Æon, as wellas observing theRecognition - the Coming into Being of a new Master of the Temple, Magister LynnNorton.“Initiates, normally scattered and isolated throughout various parts of thecontinent, had theopportunity to experience, in rituals, the essential, magical core which is, ofcourse,communication with the Set-entity. This witnessing should open doorways for theminto theirown magical evolution in terms of personal relationship with the Prince ofDarkness.“The conclave had a variety of types of experiences, ranging from highly-chargedritualatmosphere to fun & laughter and everything in between. It is really too soon tobe able to assessany but the obvious effects that Set-I will have upon the Temple of Set. Perhapsat this early stage,though, it can be summarized by saying: ‘Set, we have gathered your great noblesunto you, andwe have felt you pass near to us.’”_______________________The Ipsissimus Has Evolved- by Robert H. Moffatt III°What is an Ipsissimus? The Collins Latin Gem Dictionary translates it as “Hisvery own self”.The ending “-issimus” is grammatically the superlative degree of “ipse”, meaning“self”; or closerto Latin thought “he who is himself the most”. There is no concise Englishequivalent to“Ipsissimus”. The Temple of Set, however, has Recognized that Michael A. Aquinois anIpsissimus.High Priest Ronald K. Barrett hailed this Recognition under the stars on the30th of June XIVas a highlight to the III°+ working at XemSet, and again at the opening of theSet-I Conclave byadding to the costume of the Exalted Man a medallion made of a disc of solidgold with a sterlingsilver pentagram prominently overlaid. The beautiful piece was paid for by thePriesthood andremains the property of the Temple of Set.These events were charged with an indescribable degree of emotion that could notbeaugmented by any amount of fanfare or ceremony.The Ipsissimus was obviously deeply touched and at a loss for words to expresshis emotions atthe moment. “There are some experiences which cannot be described in words,” hesaid slowly.“This medallion is not only ceremonial. It is not beautiful solely for themetals and craft whichcompose it. It is meaningful because of the knowledge and the love with whichthe Temple hasseen fit to bestow it. I will never cease to respect it thus, and after my timehas passed, it will bereturned to the Temple. The very ability of the Temple to Recognize such adegree evidences our- 70 -evolution since 1975. The work of the Temple has been like the splitting of theatom, the openingof a whole sphere of existence, an arrival at intellectual activity on the levelof Plato.“For myself the degree of Ipsissimus is an initiatory state of being that isvery personal. Nomatter what you do, no matter where you go, whom you know, what success orfailure youexperience - that part of yourself you bring out through being, becoming - thething called‘initiation’ - makes a difference in you, not as an animal but as anintelligence unique in theuniverse.“This is true divinity. The recognition of this makes us a new breed of atomicscientist. But thisis not like a new scientific discovery. This Æon is alive!”Magus Barrett read the new By-Laws providing for the VI° and told of one of hisworkingsseveral months back when he heard Michael Aquino hailed as “the Exalted One, tobe cherished -a living symbol for us all”.Before the medallion presentation and after the High Priest had opened theconclave,Ipsissimus Aquino had remarked that: “The changeover of High Priests highlightsthis conclave.What comes out here will be a foundation for the future. John Fowles’ reactionto the cliché ‘Noman is an island’, was ‘Rubbish! Each man is an island.’ We are like returningcomets, gods andgoddesses, come hence to drink of each other’s universes in more vivid color.Here there are noleaders, no followers. Everyone is a star.”Ronald K. Barrett’s High Priesthood, which was to continue for the next twoyears, was one ofthe most intensive, experimental, inspiring, and controversial experiences forthe Temple of Set.This revolved around two passions of his: the exploration and promulgation ofhis V° Word Xemand the climate of initiatory dedication and advancement within the Temple. Hesaw the two asinterrelated, and his own office as High Priest a responsibility to advancethem.Barrett would later be [and still is] criticized for being intolerant andauthoritarian: a HighPriest who used his office to create and enforce a sort of “initiatorytotalitarianism” in contrast tothe individual-initiative climate characterizing the Temple previously andsubsequently. I thinkthis misses the mark in two respects. First, his intentions were altruistic andheartfelt; he wishednothing but to improve the Temple and the initiatory validity of each Setian.Secondly, theTemple was then, as it continues today, very much an experiment-in-progress. Atany onemoment one could not say how the current mix of ideas might work out, and thegeneral practicehas been to give them their best opportunity for success. So it was with bothBarrett and theother Setians around him.Barrett’s first major policy change was announced in the April 1980 Scroll ofSet:Lay Member Renewals Now Require Endorsement- by Ronald K. Barrett V°, High PriestIf you are I° or II°, you may have noticed recently an attempt by your III°pyramid officials toopen communications with you. So that you will better understand why, let’s takea look at theTemple of Set communications pyramid and its functions.The pyramid came into being as the answer to the question of how the Temple ofSet can bestserve the needs of Initiates both personally and comprehensively. While thisdoes not mean thatwe have [even remotely] adopted a spoon-feeding technique of initiation, it doesmean thatinitiatory guidance will be available on a more individual basis to thoseInitiates who truly applythemselves.Through the pyramid the I°/II° have direct access to a Priest or Priestess ofSet who is willingand able to assist them in finding answers to questions about magic, the Templeof Set, etc. TheTemple will also have a better perspective of the entire membership [evenisolated Setians], andthis will help in making due Recognitions and in assessing the progress andneeds of aspiringSetians. The design of the pyramid ensures that everyone is heard and informedaccording to his/her initiatory status and ability to understand. And of course the pyramid willnecessarily clear outthe deadwood.- 71 -The pyramid requires the cooperation and participation of every member of theTemple of Set.For a III° to assist or guide any lay Initiate, there must be some communicationbetween the two.It must be realized, however, that it is the responsibility of the I°/II° toinitiate and then maintainthis communication. The Priesthood is quite willing to respond, but no III° isgoing to wastevaluable time and effort trying to prod the complacent or apathetic. Those whoreceive guidancefrom the Priesthood will be those who are actively working toward magicalevolution.It is assumed that every Setian desires to aspire to the heights of hisinitiatory potential, or hewould not be a member of the Temple of Set. Not one of our Setian degrees isRecognized as theend of magical evolution, and therefore any sense of “having made it” is false.The end of anyphase of initiation is merely the beginning of another, thus “creation andchange are exalted aboverest and preservation”.If one understands this, one should also understand why inactivity isintolerable in theTemple. To allow an individual who has succumbed to the siren of contentment anddo-nothingness to enter or to remain among us would indicate that the Temple of Sethad placedemphasis on quantity rather than quality, and that most certainly is not true.Instead it is mostimportant to know and understand the above, because the pyramid is now ineffect, and with thepyramid comes the elimination of any trace of stasis together with therequirement ofdemonstrated effort to evolve.This does not mean that all Setians must become gods overnight, or that flagsshould be wavedevery time a magical insight is had, or that a letter a day keeps an expulsionaway. It does meanthat every Initiate must actively engage in Xeper, and to do so will requiresome occasional [atleast] guidance, point of reference, and higher perspective which are availablefrom thePriesthood.Keeping in mind that magical/philosophical discussion is filtered as appropriateto eachdegree, it seems only logical that all Setian Initiates should desireRecognition if for no otherreason than to have access to higher information. As stated above, the desirefor personalevolution is already assumed through affiliation with the Temple. To make a trueRecognition,however, the Priesthood must have an ongoing knowledge of the evolutionaryprogress of theindividual concerned, and this can occur only through contact whether thatcontact is throughletters, Pylon meetings, or private discussions.A I° has basically two years to Become and to be Recognized Adept II°. Thismeans that withintwo years the I° must become demonstrably knowledgeable and skilled in the Whitemagical arts.If valid reasons or circumstances prevent a I° from accomplishing this, then anextension beyondthe two-year period may be granted [pending approval of the III° pyramidofficial], but this willbe a true exception and not the rule. Again, for Recognition to occur, theSetian I° will have toestablish an initiatory relationship with his/her pyramid officials.A variation on this same principle applies to II°s. Recognition to the III°depends initiallyupon two factors: (1) the individual Adept’s evolutionary quest into the Realmof Darkness, and(2) the Gift of Set being given to the magician by Set himself. There is notime-factor imposedduring which this must occur, however, so a magician can remain II° indefinitelyand still remaina member of the Temple of Set, so long as that same magician can demonstratethat he/she isworking toward continuous magical growth and mental evolution ( Xeper). The keyshere are will,aspiration, and application. Remember that a magician is one who works magic,and if one is notworking magic, then one is not a magician/Adept. In short, the red medallion isno license torelax.Only a Master of the Temple can Recognize that an Adept has “Come Into Being” asa Priest orPriestess of Set, but II°s are assigned to III°s (not IV°s) in the pyramid. Theonly way that anAdept can be Recognized to the Priesthood is through the intuitiverecommendation of the III°s totheir own assigned Masters. It only makes sense that if the II° does notcommunicate what isgoing on inside of him to his III°s, it is highly unlikely that any evolution isgoing to be noticed.Another reason for I°/II°s to keep in touch with the Priesthood and to remainactive in theirefforts to evolve concerns the annual renewal. Let it be emphasized again thatthe Temple of Set isprogressive, evolutionary, and antistatic. All Setians who are active-statusmembers of the Templeare truly “active-status” or they are not Setian. Everyone who joins the Templeof Set joins it100%, and that includes the Temple’s creative and changing motion. Anyone whohas joined for“kicks”, or for social reasons, or on a whim has joined for the wrong reasons.No one will remain amember who does nothing, and if there are any among us who have joined for thewrong reasons,- 72 -or are doing nothing, the pyramid will very soon remedy that. This is because,with the noweffective pyramid, the I°/II° will be expected to produce appropriate evidencethat they areaspiring to Xeper forthrightly, or they will not be permitted to renew theirmembership. TheExecutive Director has been instructed that, effective immediately, renewalswill be accepted fromI°/II°s only when that renewal has been endorsed by the representative pyramidofficials. Specialslips will be sent to the appropriate officials at the same time that the goldrenewal slips aremailed to the members whose renewal time is approaching.Obviously any official who is asked to endorse a I°/II° is going to want somevalid evidencethat the member is worthy of that endorsement, but it will be the responsibilityof the lay memberto provide that evidence - not the responsibility of the official to “dig itout”.Another important point: When an official of the Temple takes the time andeffort to sit downand write out a letter that requires an answer, it’s safe to say that the letterwas not written justbecause someone needed some finger exercises. There is a perfectly good reasonfor such a letter,even though it may not be immediately apparent to the recipient. That being thecase, all laymembers will be expected to respond to correspondence which they receive fromTemple officials.It’s the courteous, respectful, and responsible thing to do.To summarize, let me say that the pyramid is a tool of great precision andutility to the Templeof Set and its entire membership. It ensures that every Setian has access to asmuch initiatoryguidance as he or she can possibly use. Through its use, the pyramid gives theTemple an accurateview of itself so that no strength or weakness goes unnoticed. The pyramid alsoserves to filter outthe lazy, the idly curious, the incompetent, and any other kind of deadwood. Inthis way we maylook upon each other with a profound pride and respect in knowing that everySetian among us isaiding in the forward thrust toward Xem.Any questions that there might be regarding the Temple of Set pyramid should bedirected toyour assigned officials, who will be only glad to answer them for you.I think the pyramid is a great thing, and I think you’re going to appreciate ittoo - so “go for it”!Xeper ir Xem.The “pyramid” to which Barrett refers here had originally been conceived byExecutiveDirector William F. Murray as a way of ensuring efficient initiatory dialoguewithin the Temple.The idea was that each Setian would be assigned one contact of a higher degreeand two or moreof a lower degree. They would be expected to keep at least occasionally intouch, and to serve as“first resources” in cases of questions & answers on Temple matters. Bill’s goodintentions andmeticulous administration of the pyramid notwithstanding, it was not muchutilized in anatmosphere in which individuals went right on communicating [or not] as thedirection andmood moved them.By tying annual membership renewal to endorsement by one’s pyramid-senior,Barrettsought to force it to function as intended, force each junior-contact to do andbe able to reportsome personal initiatory progress, and force each senior-contact to devote someattention andguidance to juniors. Not an unreasonable or oppressive set of expectations, itseemed; what noone anticipated was the lack of response to it in practice, which immediatelybegan to reducemembership renewals.Also evident in this article, though not generally perceived at the time, wasBarrett’s re-conceptualization of all of the initiatory degrees as a continuous I°-V°“ladder” up which eachSetian was expected to climb. Pre- and post-Barrett the I° was considered to bean initial-exposure/mutual evaluation degree, the II° a recognition of full suitability asa Setian andcompetence as an adept Black Magician, the III° as a uniquely-occurringmetaphysicalrelationship between some Setians and Set, and the IV°+ as specializedvariations of the III°.Under this original system, it was expected that most Setians attaining the II°would remainthere indefinitely, with of course limitless opportunity to exercise and extendtheir “Adeptitude”.Barrett saw this as simply too vague; he wanted a more structured measurement ofpersonalprogress, so he chose to redefine the numbered-degrees accordingly. Such aredefinition was not- 73 -formally announced as such, nor clearly/uniformly perceived throughout theTemple then orlater in Barrett’s tenure, and this confusion proved to be at the root of muchof the later stress.On July 19-22, 1980 the Temple’s Second International Conclave (Set-2) wasconvoked atopthe XemSet mountain in northern California. Every bit as productive and popularas itspredecessor, Set-2 generated several noteworthy articles in the August 1980Scroll of Set,reprinted here as Appendix #54. But it was a year later, at the Set-3 Conclavein San Francisco,that Barrett introduced his new membership and degree policies. As recounted inthe July 1981Scroll of Set:AlXemical Definition of Setian I° & II° to be Ensured- by Ronald K. Barrett V°, High PriestUp to now the qualifications for recognizing a Setian I° to Adept II° have beensomewhatnonspecific. They were primarily based on the Temple’s endorsement of a Setian’smembership byobserving individual motivation as well as through observed “Elect” potential.In my efforts to guide the Elect to Xem, I have become increasingly aware thatthe magicalexpertise and understanding of several II°s has been insufficient tocomprehend/accomplish thework which lies ahead of us. Awhile back and in response to this awareness, Iintroduced“Definition by Degree”, which redefined each of our initiatory degrees asappropriate to Xeper irXem. Response to this was positive, as was response to the reactivation andemphasis on thePyramid Project.Now that these are basically understood and active, it is time to formalize anactual policy toensure proper magical initiation and evolution appropriate to the work under thecurrent magicalformula. This new policy is designed to maximize the magical education and skillof each I°initiate to the peaks of individual potential and ability. This policy(henceforward incorporatedinto and called “Definition by Degree”) enforces and ensures the alXemicaldefinition and purposeof Setian I° and Adept II°.Setian I°:The individual holding the I° is one who has entered the Setian Temple ofinitiation. A Setianof any Temple degree is an individual who is aspiring to the knowledge of Setand to becoming agod in his own right, and the I° is at the first stage of this process which iscalled Xeper ir Xem.This process, however, will not just “occur”. It must be willed, and the degreeof will used willdetermine both the rate and extent of this unique evolution. The will of which Iwrite is magicalwill, and is not merely wishful thinking, ambition, or even aspiration bythemselves. It is a forceof immense power, and its mastery must make of it an exacting science as well asa fine art.The I° is a phase of initiation during which the Setian must learn magicaltheory and practice,must gain a wide spectrum of knowledge and influence in as many areas of hislife as possible, andmust become a true master of will. When the Setian has become such a master ofthe magical will,he will have an understanding of the Word of the Æon of Horus, which is“Thelema”. He willembody the principle of “Do What Thou Wilt”, for this is the whole of the law ofthe I°.Adept II°:One who has mastered the magical will is then qualified to be Recognized asAdept: one who isan expert, a master of an art. A master of a specific art is in a position toapply his skills andunderstanding in a multitude of ways including experimentation, invention of newtechniques,exploration etc.; and all because he has the necessary knowledge of/ability touse the principlesinvolved.A true master is far more than a technician; he is an artist. Anyone can learnto paint-by-numbers but only a true artist can produce a masterpiece. This is no less truein the magical arts,and for this reason the Word governing the II° is “Indulgence” - just as it wasthe Word of the Ageof Satan. Only a master can fully indulge in the whole of whatever art he hasmastered, and onlyan Adept can fully indulge in the magical arts. Further only those who are ableto explore the farreaches of magic are able to open the Gates to the Dark Realm and to fullymaster the BlackFlame.- 74 -Army of Adepts:The Army of Adepts will be composed of masters of the magical arts (II°s) in thefirst stages ofguardianship of the Æon of Set and the oncoming Æon of Xem. It is these Adeptswho will wieldtheir skills to protect the new ones who are even now coming into being.This is not an army in the normal sense of the word, but rather a force ofmagical beingsunited in the purpose of guarding the higher aspects of initiation. None maypass by withoutBecoming.____________________________________Revised Qualifications for Recognition to II°- by Ronald K. Barrett V°, High PriestThe new policy: To make a reality of all this, it is necessary to revise thequalifications forRecognition to II°.The first new qualification will come through a required reading list. This listis made up ofcarefully-selected books which will offer the Initiate a wide variety of magicalinformation. Theinformation acquired from this list is not only useful but necessary forsuccessful initiation withinthe Temple of Set. For this reason and effective immediately, no Recognition ofa Setian I° as an"},{"pageContent":"Adept II° will occur prior to the Setian’s having read and digested every bookon the list.In addition to the required reading list, a recommended reading list has alsobeen prepared tocover a wide range of subjects which either directly or indirectly aids magicalinitiation. This list isintended to complement the required list while leaving the I° the option topursue the variedsubjects according to individual interest and initiative.Since the recommended list contains no claim to being a complete list coveringall subjects ofinterest, Setians should feel free to extend their studies beyond the list. If atext not included oneither list is found to be of particular worth, I suggest that the text(s) bebrought to the attentionof the entire Temple of Set via the Scroll or through Pyramid officials.Testing will also become a necessary part of the new II° Recognition process,and will coverboth information that the Setian should gain and practical application of thatacquired knowledge.Here is how the testing and resulting Recognition will work:When a Setian I° is felt to be adept in the magical arts, an appropriateofficial will discuss thematter of administering the test with the I°. If the Setian desires to take thetest, it will bearranged. Testing will not be administered under any circumstances until theentire requiredreading list has been studied by the I°.Under the new policy the I° may also present himself to an appropriate Pyramidofficial andask that the test be administered. The decision on the request will be made bythe official.The written test will be extensive and will include (a) multiple-choicequestions, (b) essayquestions, (c) fill-in questions, and (d) essays on various subjects. The testwill contain mostlyquestions taken from the required reading list, but it will also containquestions taken from bookson the recommended list - at least one question from each book. This will beprimarily todetermine the personal initiative of the I° to study/learn beyond just what isrequired.Only when the Setian passes the written test will the next part of the test betaken. The secondpart of the test will be to determine the Setian’s practical magical abilities,and will include writtenconstruction of at least three different types of rituals and actual performanceof no fewer thantwo of these rituals in the presence of an evaluating Temple official. Theofficial will judge (a) theoverall effectiveness of the ritual, ( b) the display of magical expertise, and(c) the actualapplication of valid magical principles. The written rituals will be submittedprior to performanceof the rituals for evaluation, and so the official will know what to expect.A fee of $10 will be charged for testing to cover the expense of the paperworkinvolved and tocover the cost of the red Pentagram of Set medallion. If the test is failed, thecost of the medallionwill be returned. Copies of the test will be mailed by the Setian to bothPyramid officials forgrading.When the test has been passed, the testing official(s) will make the finaldecision ofRecognition based on the personal qualities of the Setian, including attitude,initiative, lifestyle,etc. Following this final evaluation, the Recognition may occur as prescribed inthe Temple By-Laws.- 75 -The new Adept II° will then be truly qualified to proudly bear the title ofAdept, master of themagical arts, and to wear the red Pentagram medallion as exactly what itsymbolizes. The Adeptwill also then be ready to begin the next phase of personal initiation.To be fair, and in order that the II° does not have a double standard, allcurrently-RecognizedII°s will likewise be expected to undergo this testing process [without fee].Although this newprogram is in effect as of this date, currently-Recognized II°s will be givenuntil the South SolsticeXVI to prepare for testing, which must occur at some time between then and theVernal EquinoxXVII. Adepts who pass the test will bear a new mark of distinction and honor.Those who do notpass, or who do not take the test by the deadline date, will be returned to I°status until such timeas they can meet the qualifications prescribed in this new policy.Testing already Recognized II°s is also necessary because of the next part ofthe new policy,which involves the Pyramid Project.Immediately after Vernal Equinox XVII, the Executive Director will release a newPyramidroster which will assign II°s as magical advisors to I°s. This advisory capacityis only for the sakeof assisting I° Initiates to become adept in magic, and carries no officialTemple of Set authority. Itdoes, however, give an opportunity for II°s to assume some degree ofresponsibility, and toexercise the full scope of their knowledge. From this perspective it now becomesquite feasible forII°s to form and lead Pylons [as prescribed in the Ruby Tablet of Set] if a II°desires to do so.If a II° magical advisor feels one of his assigned I°s has become qualified forpossible II°Recognition, the II° should bring the Setian to the attention of the appropriateofficial, who will inturn determine whether or not to administer the testing process. Magicaladvisors might also beconsulted by the Pyramid officials in making annual renewal evaluations of I°s.Consider with me now the caliber of magical Initiates that shall result fromthis new policy,tough as it is. We can easily predict a new measure of strength rising into theElect of Set whichwill benefit us all in our work to Xeper ir Xem. Magical evolution is thefundamental processthrough which Xeper can occur. We shall behold upon the path to Xem magicianswhose beingsare magical - not merely beings who do rituals. Of such beings are the seeds ofthe gods to come.Listen. Listen very closely, and you can hear them breathing all around you.In theory there was something to be said for Barrett’s new approach to II°Recognition. Hewas concerned that [at least some] Setians I° were being Recognized as AdeptsII° without reallybecoming knowledgeable in and accomplished in the application of magic. Byinstituting aliterary study curriculum (Appendix #57) and requiring the passing of a writtentest based uponit, he thought to solve this problem. But complications and confusion soonarose. Many of therequired [and recommended] books were expensive and/or unavailable. The bookswere notmutually-supportive and, with few exceptions, were not designed as instructionaltextbooks.Some were scientific and carefully-argued; others were speculative andoccasionally incoherent.Hence a Setian I°, even if managing to acquire the required books, was atsomething of a lossas to what he was expected to glean from them, much less to apply it. ExistingAdepts or Priestswould not be of much help here, since none of them had been subjected to thisnew curriculumor passed a test based upon it.Barrett’s solution to these impediments was characteristically methodical: Hewould grade allof the tests himself, and he would require existing Adepts II° to take the testas well. If they failedit, they would be returned to Iůntil they passed it.Over the next eight months no one passed the test. On 3/8/1982 a frustratedBarrett wrote tothe Priesthood:There seems to be some confusion within the Priesthood regarding the test, andso I wouldlike to take some time to clear up the confusion so that we can get back to thereason for itsexistence, i.e. magical initiation.At the Set-3 Conclave I formally announced that the infamous [now] test was tobe regarded aspolicy for Recognizing a Setian as II°. O.K., that seemed to be understood byall present and thenlater by all recipients of the Scroll. So well received was the new policy thatthe Priesthood III°- 76 -committed itself [in front of the entire membership attending] to taking italso, by saying that itwould need to be proficient in the same knowledge that it requires for SetianAdepts.So I worked and worked for four months putting together a magical test thatwould be theenvy of every magical order/coven/society/system of the 20th Century CE. Icarried the damnedthing to my job, read and thought and took notes everywhere - all the whiletrying to cover asmuch significant & comprehensive ground as was reasonable and necessary. By AllHallow’s it wasall but done and, then out it went for circulation to the Priesthood.Now I was hot to get it out because I wanted the Priesthood to have time to takeit and befinished with it before the Adepts’ tests started coming in for evaluationaround Vernal Equinox ofthis year. Then it occurred to me that your own tests, evaluated and commentedupon by me,when returned would be an excellent guide for you to use in evaluating the testsover which youwould be officiating. Then the Magick - Not Without Tears began to rain on thetest. It is now lessthan three weeks until Equinox and not one III° has sent in the test forevaluation. This is in spiteof the fact that you have had it since November 1981.And then the real confusion set it in a tizzy. Everyone (except a few concernedII°s) forgot thattesting was to occur between the South Solstice 1981 and the Vernal Equinox1982, which is thedeadline for already-Recognized Adepts. That deadline means that the test mustbe in our handsand completed for evaluation. Per my instructions that went out with the test,the allotted time fortaking the test is 90 days, and 90 days before the Vernal Equinox is the SouthSolstice!So why is it that some II°s have only recently received their tests, whileothers still do not havethem? Granted I am partly at fault for not mapping out the exact procedure ofwhether the Adeptsshould ask for the test or whether it should just be sent to them. My intentionwas that it just besent in time for them to start on the Solstice, and the confusion over this wasonly made known tome ten days ago. So why didn’t someone ask?Anyway what it boils down to is that you were evidently waiting for them, andthey werewaiting on you; and now I am stuck resolving the problem. So here is how I amgoing to resolvethe entire problem:(1) Except in very unique instances (such as I have already been met with), thedeadlinestill holds. Any II° who was too unconcerned to ask for the test or at least toquestionyou and who now does not have enough time to complete the test, must send inwhathe has completed. No special allowance will be made in evaluation, and ifsomeonefails, he will be reduced to Setian I°.(2) All III°s who have II°s will instruct them to send their tests directly tome,postmarked no later than midnight 3/20/82. I will personally evaluate each testandthen return it to the III° official who issued the test for either continuedtesting or forreduction to I°.(3) Since we all agreed that the test was such a good idea [and it is], andsince we agreedthat all members of the Priesthood should be able to discuss the informationtherein,i.e. have knowledge of White Magic, magical symbolism, and magically-relatedsubjects, I am now issuing the directive that all members of the Priesthood III°mustcomplete and pass the test by 4/15/82. Failure to comply with this directivewill be indirect violation of §5.01 of the Temple of Set By-Laws. While it may seem likeAnubisis being unnecessarily rigid about this, remember that I have a rather awesomeresponsibility to guide the Elect to Xem. Neither Set nor I take it lightly (nopun), soif it is getting too tough, maybe it’s time to reconsider your priorities andPath. If awritten test is too much for you, I can guarantee you'll never accomplish theGreatWork. Q.E.D.On that happy note, I will close for now, but with the promise that you willsoon be hearingfrom me again with - you guessed it - a brand new policy. And yes, I do otherthings than sitaround dreaming up new policies. For instance I ... I ... er ... uh ... and then... or ... Well anyway ...Whatever additional new policy Barrett may have had in mind, he evidentlythought better ofit, and suddenly, on 5/31/82, sent the Priesthood a brief letter resigning theHigh Priesthood, the- 77 -Priesthood, and the Temple of Set; and recommending Magus Lynn Norton as hissuccessor. Heconcluded:Please honor my desire for an honorable, quiet, graceful, and quick exit by notattempting tocontact me, as it will only be futile, since I am absolutely resolved about thiscourse of action. I amequally resolved not to discuss this further than saying, “This is my will!”To the entire Temple of Set, including myself, this came as a complete surpriseand shock. On6/1/82 the Council of Nine unanimously voted me back into the High Priesthood todeal with thesituation, and on 6/10/82 I sent a letter to all Setians with my initialthoughts (Appendix #56).Indeed since relinquishing the High Priesthood to Barrett in 1979, I had largelyretired fromactive involvement in Temple affairs - both because I didn’t want to “step onthe new HighPriest’s feet” and because I was immersed in two major research projects: myPh.D. dissertationfor the University of California and my memoir/history The Church of Satan. So Ihad not beenpaying much attention to Barrett’s drastic new policies or their effects uponthe membershipuntil 6/1/82, when I suddenly found myself once again in the High Priesthood andtrying to get agrip on the situation.In his resignation letter Barrett had recommended Magus Lynn A. Norton as hissuccessor tothe High Priesthood. Norton had been Recognized to the V° by Barrett at theSet-3 Conclaveupon his Utterance of the Word Per-t during the main working. It would, hepromised, beexplained in detail at the next (Set-4) Conclave beginning 7/1/82 in SanFrancisco.On 6/1 & 6/3 I telephoned Norton in Michigan to discuss the High Priesthood withhim. Isaw no reason not to go along with Barrett’s recommendation, particularly sinceNorton was theTemple’s newest, and presumably most “current” Magus V°. However, I said, I wasconcernedabout how Barrett had arbitrarily revised Temple administrative structures andprocedures, aswell as the degree-system itself. Before passing along the High Priesthoodagain, I first wanted toget things stabilized, and to propose revisions to the By-Laws to prevent afuture “runaway HighPriest” recurrence.What it took me a little longer to realize was that Norton liked Barrett’sstringent andautocratic revisions just fine, and indeed was counting on them to be there forhis own use uponbecoming High Priest. As a result of this the imminent Set-4 Conclave turnedinto a veritablesoap opera of maneuverings attempting to remove me from the High Priesthood andinstallNorton in it before the By-Laws, or any of Barrett’s High Priest policies, couldbe changed. In theAugust 1982 Scroll I summarized the surprising, traumatic, and exhaustingoutcome (Appendix#57).What was the extended aftermath of Ronald K. Barrett’s High Priesthood?Initially a greatshock to the Temple, which in the last year before the Set-4 Conclave had almostdisintegratedfrom several hundred Initiates to a mere 31. Several of the Temple’s mostsenior, veteran, andaccomplished Initiates had either resigned in protest against Barrett’spolicies, been expelled byhim, or resigned/were expelled during the stress, confusion, emotional pain, anddisillusionmentsurrounding Set-4. Among the departed [in various of these categories] wereMasters MargaretWendall, Linda Thomas, Dale Seago, Lynn Norton; Priests/Priestesses ColleenHuddleston,Linda Reynolds, Alexandra Sarris, Ricco Zapitelli, Robert Brink, Corey Cole,Philip Folkler,Amber Seago, Michael Waters, and Alan Sturrock. Except in terms of “experienceand lessonslearned”, the Temple of Set was smaller and weaker than at any other time in itshistory.Those of us who survived and remained were determined to rebuild the Temple, andthistime to expand and strengthen its By-Laws to prevent such a disaster fromrecurring. How wewent about that is the subject of the next chapter.- 78 -[index-79_1.jpg][index-79_2.jpg]- 79 -7: RemanifestationThe fall of 1982 saw the Temple of Set catching its breath after the series ofsurprises andshocks accompanying the end of Ronald K. Barrett’s High Priesthood. Much as inthe summer of1975, I sensed curious eyes on me as once-again High Priest: What was I going todo now? In a10/5/1982 letter to the Priesthood, I said:I have done quite a bit of reflection on the phenomenon of the Temple of Setrecently. Myconclusion is that it is high time for us to get our shit together. We havespent seventeen yearsgenerating sane really good, creative, sophisticated, and conceptually advancedmaterial in a widevariety of forms and contexts. It is far better than anything the “outsideworlds” of academia, theoccult, conventional religions, and/or conventional philosophies have to offer.In fact it is sodamned advanced that I am still astonished at it every time I ponder it.Its one defect is that it is still largely fragmented and disorganized. We needto clean it up,polish it, integrate, evaluate, and interrelate it. Then, as we really begin toget it together, we needto apply it in an extremely intelligent and evolutionary manner. [For you“old-timers”, this is whatI was getting at in very rudimentary way in my original concepts ofSetamorphosis; see relevantIII° letters from my original High Priesthood.]The Church of Satan project and the Jeweled Tablets of Set project are allaspects of this“bringing together” of the significance of the Temple and Æon of Set. If we dothis successfully,the results will be nothing short of titanic. If we drop the ball without doingit, it’s kind of likeflying the Enterprise on impulse power: It’s O.K. as far as it goes, but it justisn’t the same as warpdrive!As you can see from something like our reading list, the scope of the Temple andÆon goes far,far beyond what is generally considered “the occult”. It reaches out to the mostambitious frontiersof existence - and aspires to go beyond. This is why I am so disappointed andfranklycontemptuous of those who tried to relegate the Temple to an introverted,inconsequential, andincoherent little pageant concerned only with Aleister Crowley, Tarot cards, andHer-Bak. I amfond of all three subjects myself - but in proportion and only insofar as theycontribute to the fargreater magical and philosophical reach that is the true justification and gloryof the Temple ofSet.A few days ago Lilith Sinclair and I spent a most interesting evening withan old friend, Dr.Richard Sutter, whom you know as “Imperial General Tharrud Terclis, STF” in TheDark Side. Dr.Sutter has never joined the Temple of Set, nor have I ever offered him honorarymembership, formuch the same reasons that Terclis would not/could not became a Jedi in The DarkSide Yet, alsolike Terclis, he is more sensitive to the significance and consequence of theTemple than manywho are formally affiliated with it.His evaluation of the events surrounding Set-IV was blunt and candid: merely thefailure ofinferior intellects and characters to continue maintaining the strain of a falseimage of excellence.Further their resentment of and antagonism towards those whose excellence isneither artificialnor an image.- 80 -I might add that, several years ago, Sutter predicted such a crisis for theTemple down toextremely specific details - based upon psychological probabilities of the sortthat became thebasis for The Dark Side’s MindWar concept. [I told him he was certainlymistaken.]Our General Terclis would like to see this Jedi Order actualize its statedreasons for existence,yet believes that its premises are too idealistic, too visionary to succeed formore than a briefminute in the fabric of time and space. The Universe in which he has chosen tolive and work is aduller, darker, more pessimistic one than that of the Jedi; but in it he hasextended his ownphilosophy to remarkable limits.Like Darth Vader and Obi-wan Kenobi, I am of the opinion that our LargerUniverse is valid,and that the initiatory process of our Jedi Order, imperfect though it may be,has somethingsupremely precious to impart to those whose Will it is to attain it.So General Terclis and I disagree ... but I have learned much from ourcontinuing dialogue.Structurally the Temple of Set was sound enough with its legal credentials andoperationalBy-Laws (which had indeed been crucial in bringing the organization safely andintactly throughthe RKB/Set-IV crisis). Now we turned fresh attention to our publications.When we [re]created the Temple of Set in 1975, we thought that it should havebothtemporary/periodical and permanent/reference publications. The Scroll of Setnewsletter tookcare of the former, and has amassed a vast amount of articles, essays, art,news, Order/Pylon/Element reports, conclave pre/post-discussions, etc. since then. In thisInternet age all of theback-issues are downloadable by all Setians.The Jeweled Tablets got their name-inspiration whimsically, as a takeoff on thefabled,forbidden, and funky Emerald Tablet of Thoth, in which all great occultknowledge wassupposedly contained. So we decided to do a real collection of tablets, as itwere, but aligned toour initiatory degree system.The Crystal Tablet (gem color of the I°) would be provided to all Setians, andissued toentering Setians I°. It would serve as an introduction to and summary of Setianphilosophy andmetaphysics, explain the various administrative systems and functional groupscomprising theTemple, and discuss opportunities for each Setian to undertake personalinitiation. As it is theTemple's “common reference document”, its contents are relevant to all Setians,not just the I°.And, like all of the JT s, it is constantly updated. Through the 1980s it wasmailed out as a loose-leaf binder; since then it’s a CD, and all of its contents are also in theTemple’s Intranet. Excerptsfrom my introductory CT essay, “Black Magic”, now appears as Part II of this TheTemple of Set.The Ruby Tablet (gem color of the II°) would be available to Adepts II°+, andwould be arepository of the Temple’s more extensive and permanent documents than wouldnormally befound in the Scroll of Set newsletter. Since most of the Temple of Set’sinformation isintentionally for the benefit of all Adepts, the RT would be the largest, and“backbone”, volumeof the Jeweled Tablets. And so it has been. By the mid-1980s it was alreadyabout 6 large redbinders in size, and was rapidly becoming cost-daunting even at nonprofit.Happily it too hasbeen rescued by the Internet, and is now wholly searchable & downloadable there.[And I cannotpossibly continue further here without mentioning, with the utmost admirationand frank awe,the years of intensive, exhaustive, and perfection-obsessed work that MagisterRobert Menschel,as Ruby Tablet Editor, invested in that publication to transform it from abare-bones idea to anencyclopædia of staggering dimensions and unsurpassed quality. If a massivemeteor were tostrike the Earth and obliterate all traces of the Temple of Set except for oneslightly-charred copyof the Ruby Tablet, I daresay that everything could be reconstituted from thatalone.]The RT’s contents are of equal significance to all the II°+ and are contributedto by all ofthem as well. The reason the RT is not available to the I° is twofold:(1) The I° is a “mutual evaluation” degree, wherein both the individual and theTemplehave an extended [up to 2-year] opportunity to decide if they are suited for one- 81 -another. Some join the Temple for the wrong reasons, or decide after contactwith itthat it is not after all their cup of tea. And from the Temple’s perspective,some I°ssimply don’t have the aptitude, intelligence, or interest to become BlackMagicians,which is what II° Recognition is all about. So during their I° time, Setians areexpected to familiarize themselves with the Temple, its ideas, its tools, andflextheir mental & magical muscles accordingly. Think of it somewhat as the “generaleducation requirements” of a university, with entry-level/familiarizationcoursesoffered by the various departments.(2) The material in the RT is specifically written for Setians who have “passedthe I°test” and shown themselves to be competent enough to handle it. Essentially wetrust Recognized Adepts II° to use this information wisely and responsibly. Wedonot trust the Great Unwashed [public] to do so, and entering I°s need to gettheir“sea legs” first.The Onyx Tablet (gem color of the III°) is available to the Priesthood of SetIII°+ andcontains documents specifically pertinent to the Priesthood as a personalinitiatory andconsecrating experience. [General material about the III° is contained in eitherthe CT or RT asappropriate.] Thus the OT is written by III° Initiates for other III°s. Articleshave to do with theessence of the III° and how it may be Recognized in Adepts.There are two general reasons for the OT’s III°+ restriction:(1) The authentic III° is a uniquely individual initiation if & when it occurs.If non-III°sread existing III°+ reflections on the Priesthood, they may be tempted toartificiallyimitate others’ initiation. The Priesthood of Set is not and cannot be a“standardized office”.(2) The Priesthood of Set is the consecrated core of the Temple of Set, and assuchdesires to preserve its privacy and serenity.The Sapphire, Amethyst, & Topaz Tablets are all accessible to the Masters of theTemple ofSet IV°+. Their distinction is simply that each contains material andcommentaries specificallypertinent to the IV°, V°, and VI° respectively; and again this is only materialthat, for soundreason (such as the initiatory capability to understand it in proper context,and again deterrenceof “initiatory imitation”) should not be in the CT/RT (wherein again the vastmajority ofdocuments pertinent to the IV°+ are contained).Incidentally the IV°+ access to the IV°/V°/VI° volumes reflects the principlethat the IV° isthe Æonic level of individual initiation. The V° and VI° are “specializedvariations” of the IV°,and are thus fully comprehensible by it. Nor are we concerned about V° or VI°imitation, becausethe very nature of such Recognitions is antithetical to this.So if you were to put all the JT s side-by-side, you'd find the RT to be huge,the CT to be a sortof “Boy Scout Handbook”, and the other four to be very slim indeed. The main“push” in ourmagical & philosophical material is always to the RT, because there it isavailable to all adeptSetians II°-VI°.This structuring of the JT s’ contents and access also reflects a fundamentalprinciple ofSetian initiation: One’s Recognition to a specific degree of initiation denotesthe capacity, notthe continuity of being present in and manifesting what is signified by thatRecognition. Mostadept Setians, myself included, function 95% of the time as Adepts II°. Only incertain instanceswhere the unique characteristics of another degree are called for does it arisein consciousness.- 82 -I should perhaps take note in passing that today there are pirated JT s all overthe Internet.[There is pirated everything all over the Internet!] Can’t help that. Becauseall of the JT s arebeing updated all the time, though, the pirated versions usually incomplete andobsolete; and asyou can see here, the OT, ST, AT, & TT are relatively obscure withoutsynchronization toindividual initiation at related levels.In Chapter #6 and Appendix #56 I discussed High Priest Barrett’s concept andintroductionof what he termed “Order Without Law”. This was a system of initiatory Orderswithin andsubordinate to the Temple of Set proper. All I°-III° Setians were required to be“apprenticed” toone of these Orders, each headed by a Master of the Temple IV°, and wouldhenceforth workprimarily, if not exclusively within it. One of the consequences of this,unfortunately, was thatsuch Orders, most conspicuously Barrett’s own Order of Anubis, simply becamecliquesconcerned with their own members and interests, not with the Temple of Set andall Setiansgenerally. By the Set-IV Conclave, members of the Order of Anubis knew moreabout Barrett’spolicies and priorities than did the Council of Nine.On resuming the High Priesthood, therefore, I discontinued “Order Without Law”immediately, but the basic concept of specialized Orders within the Temple was avaluable andviable one. In the Crystal Tablet I outlined how the Order system would functionhenceforth:Within the Temple of Set there exist a number of specialized Orders, eachsupervised by a IV°+ Initiate as Grand Master of that Order. To contact a specific Order,communicate with theGrand Master of that Order as listed in the Order Directory in this CrystalTablet.Perhaps the best way to visualize the Temple of Set’s concept of Orders is tothink of theTemple as a university, with the Orders as the various academic departments.Students at theuniversity, in the course of their general education, may sample subjects atappropriateintroductory levels in various departments. Upon completing their generaleducation, studentswith an interest in or aptitude for a particular department may “major” in thatdepartment andpossibly go on to graduate work in that field. Nonetheless all the departmentscooperate in theoperation of the university as a whole, and its general academic environmentlends a sense ofperspective to the various departments - so that their faculty and students canrelate to a worldbeyond their field of specialization.General guidelines concerning the Temple of Set’s Orders are as follows:1. Only a IV° Initiate may establish an Order within the Temple. This has beenthe traditionalprerogative of this degree since the time of the G.'.D.'. and the A.'.A.'.2. An Order is characterized by special interests and emphases, which may beformalized byspecial introductory and ritual procedures within that Order. Such interests andemphasesmay not clash with those of the Temple of Set as a whole, and an Order’sinitiatory systemmust be subordinate to and supportive of the system of the Temple as a whole.3. The Grand Master (presiding IV°+) of each Order exercises complete authorityover thatOrder, subject to the review of the High Priest of Set.4. Subject to exemptions approved by the High Priest, Orders will accept onlyII°+ Setians asInitiates. This is based on the premise that I° Setians should concentrate ontheir “generalmagical education” prior to specializing within a particular Order.5. While an Adept II° may specialize indefinitely, a Priest or Priestess of SetIII° must possess ahigh level of general knowledge. IV°+s who are Grand Masters of Orders will notRecognizenew III°s solely on the basis of their competence within a particular Order, butratheraccording to their broader skills and State of Being within the Temple and Æonof Set.6. The fruits of an Order’s work must actively extend beyond the Initiates ofthat Order to theTemple of Set as a whole. The only exception to this is that initiatoryceremonies within an- 83 -Order may be private to that Order, per the magical principle that uninvolvedobservers atsuch ceremonies can impair their effectiveness.7. Normally a Setian may belong to only one Order within the Temple of Set, onthe premise thatpersonal efforts would otherwise be diluted. On the same premise, personalmovementbetween various Orders is not recommended. Aspirants are advised to interviewandcorrespond with various Orders before making a personal commitment to any one inparticular. A Setian may belong to more than one Order only by first obtainingthe approval ofboth Order Grand Masters.8. Within a year of being Recognized to the II°, Adepts of the Temple arenormally expected toaffiliate with an Order. There is no penalty for not doing so, but Adepts willfind that anincreasing amount of Temple activity beyond the I° takes place within the Ordersystem.9. Setians of all degrees may freely visit activities of all Orders, except asnoted in #6 above.10. There is no required or standard internal design for an Order, save thateach be headed by aIV°+ with the formal title of Grand Master.11. Order insignia may be worn either together with Temple of Set insignia oralone. When it isworn with Temple insignia, it must not conflict with, cover, or displace it.12. Priests and Priestesses of Set III° will be encouraged to involve themselveswith specializedconcerns of an Order only after their Priestly affairs are amply in hand. In allcases this meansactive involvement with potential Setians and I°/II° Setians who are working tobecome fullyAdept at the Black Arts at a personal level. In many cases it further means theestablishmentand leadership of a Pylon of the Temple. [The effect of this provision is thatan enthusiastic II°member of a particular Order will have to resolve to put Order-specificinterests on the backburner should he or she be Recognized to the Priesthood of Set. Active workwithin Orders willbe done mostly by II° and IV° Initiates, with III°s contributing only aftertheir more generalresponsibilities within the Temple are fulfilled. Hence II°s who are intenselyinterested in aparticular Order should consider this provision before aspiring to the III°.]13. Orders’ areas of focus may be historic, philosophical, geographic,psychological, or almostanything else that does not conflict with the Temple of Set’s basic ethicalguidelines.Accompanying this Introduction in the Crystal Tablet are general statements fromthe variousOrders. Some are currently active, some are temporarily inactive, and some arehistoricallydormant. Check the “Orders” Directory file to see which ones are currentlyactive. If you arecurious concerning one or more of the other Orders, many of which have a richlegacy ofcontribution to the archives of the Temple of Set, examine theInterCommunication Roster to seeif Initiates involved with them are included. Also examine the Back-IssueCollection of the Scrollof Set for Order-related articles.In 1982, however, the Temple of Set did not yet have a functioning model forthis newgeneration of Order. That was about to change, far away in Germany.- 84 -[index-85_1.jpg]- 85 -8: The Wewelsburg WorkingOn November 8, 1982 I wrote to the Priesthood of Set [and thereafter to allSetians in theFebruary 1983 Scroll of Set]:The Wewelsburg Working - BackgroundThe reason for my silence during the past month is about to be explained; I havebeenout of the country. During the first part of October I participated in a seriesof tours ofNATO installations in England, Belgium, and Germany arranged through the WorldAffairs Council.I haven’t been to London and Brussels since 1958 or to Germany since XIII, so itwasinteresting to see the changes and non-changes that have occurred. It wassurprising todiscover that london, which I had supposed to be a nerve-center of occultism,has onlyone tiny bookshop - “Atlantis” - dealing in the Black Arts. It is perhaps 1/4the size ofGilbert’s in L.A. or Weiser’s in NYC, and I made no discoveries within itsshelves. Theowner was pleased to display a stock of our informational pamphlets, however.On the next block I bumped into the London office of E.J. Brill, the Dutchpublisherswho once published Seth, God of Confusion hardcover and expensive. For manyyears ithas been out of print; now it is back in print softcover and less expensive(48.00 DutchGld.). we will explore ways to order this unique volume at minimum inconveniencetoSetians.After the conclusion of the NATO tours, I was able to undertake a long-awaitedpersonal quest. In “That Other Black Order”, an article on Nazi occultism whichI wrotefor Cloven Hoof #IV-4 (April VII) [ The Church of Satan Appendix #40], Irecounted thatHeinrich Himmler had appropriated a Westphalian castle, the Wewelsburg, and hadmodified it for ritual and Black Magical activities of the SS. The more I triedto obtaindetails concerning the Wewelsburg, the more frustrated I became. It was soonapparentthat author after author has simply recited the half-paragraph’s worth of rumorsfirstpublished in the mid-1950s. No one had troubled to visit the castle [if it stillexisted] norphotograph it.Until this last month, therefore, I had no idea whether the Wewelsburg stillexistedand, if so, whether the chambers in question had been destroyed, remodeled, orsimplysealed.Tourist guidebooks of Germany made no mention of the castle; it was only withtheaid of a large-scale map of Westphalia that I found the initials “Schl”[oss]next to the tinyvillage of Wewelsburg. It is the better part of a day’s drive on the high-speedautobahn- 86 -from Frankfurt on 10/19, then a zig-zag course through a thick forest on a smallback roadinto the town, which looked as small and sleepy as any other German town. Stillno castleto be seen.Then a directional marker (“Zum Schloss”) pointing down a back alley, with moretwists and turns, and then: Castle Wewelsburg, apparently intact and perfectlypreserved,and virtually invisible even from the town because of the surrounding forestsand terrain.As seen from above it is in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with the keep atthe northapex and the other two towers at the southwest and southeast corners.Passing the small guardhouse (with a defaced but still legible “SS” stone emblematop), I crossed the bridge to the main entrance in the east wall, entered thecourtyard,and knocked at the door of what was evidently a small museum of the castle’smedievalhistory. In answer to my questions, the elderly curator politely informed methat the tworitual chambers were very much intact. Would I like to see them? Indeed I would,thankyou!The Wewelsburg is used [except for the museum and the two ceremonial chambers]asa youth hostel. Entering the North Tower from the courtyard brings one to the“MarbleHall”. This circular chamber is completely unfurnished, save for two blackfloor-candleholders with red candles by one of the doors. Into the center of the redmarble flooris set a rune-wheel made of green stone, with the central disc of black marble.Each runepoints to one of 12 green sandstone columns, forming cross arris vaults above 12windowsalso framed in green sandstone. The chamber’s only other decoration is aroughly-hewnblock of stone above the door with the black candleholders.To give you some idea of the wild distortions that have been publishedconcerning theWewelsburg, the following is quoted from Francis King’s Satan and Swastika:The center of the castle was the great banqueting hall, furnished with agigantic tablearound which were placed large wooden chairs almost thrones upholstered withpigskinand with the name of the rightful occupant inscribed on silver plates. In thesechairsHimmler and his favorite subordinates would sit both for conferences concernedwithmundane matters and for group meditation - long hours of silence in which theparticipants were supposed to strengthen their ties with the “Race Soul”.Besides Himmlerhimself, never more than 12 SS men were allowed to sit down at the table; thereasons forthis are not clear, but it is possible that he was either blasphemouslyparodying the LastSupper or seeing himself symbolizing the Sun surrounded by the 12 signs of theZodiac.Above the banqueting hall were Himmler’s own rooms ... Below the hall was thecrypt,the ‘realm of the dead’, in which 12 unoccupied pedestals were placed around astonehollow. On the death of each of Himmler’s chosen 12, his coat of arms was to beburned,and the ashes placed in an urn on one of the pedestals ...In actuality the floor emblem and other architectural features of the MarbleHall makeit clear that the chamber was never designed to contain a central table, nor dothe originalSS plans (which I examined) show it ever containing one. The conference hall inthe westwall held a large, but not “gigantic” table and approximately 30 - not 12 - ofthe largeleather - not pigskin, nor with silver nameplate - chairs referred to [I triedone out].The dining hall was a third, smaller hall located in the south wall. Himmler’sownrooms were not above any of the three halls; they were in the southwest tower.Neitherthe library nor the weapons museum were in Himmler’s rooms; they were inseparaterooms on different floors.The recurring 12s of the Marble Hall probably have a solar/cosmic significanceratherthan a personal/human one. There were 12 central SS offices, each headed by an- 87 -Obergruppenführer (Lt. General). [A 12-seat table would have excluded the 13th:Himmler himself!]The Hall of the Dead is located directly beneath the Marble Hall in the NorthTower.To enter it one must go outside the castle and down to the base of the NorthTower. Astone stair leads down to the Hall.The Hall of the Dead is domed; at the apex of the dome is a rune-accentedswastika.Four holes in this emblem have encouraged the popular idea that there was aconcealedsmoke vent in the ceiling; this is not the case.The four large windows opening into the Hall from the exterior of the towerargueagainst the Hall’s being designed as a tomb, nor are the 12 pedestals highenough orprotected enough for funerary urns. They are platforms for either statues orliveindividuals.The acoustics of the chamber are such that, standing upon a pedestal, one can beheard in a whisper in any other part of the room.The central pit is not designed for bonfires. Its purpose became clear to me assoon asI descended into it; it places an individual at the acoustic focus of thechamber, as well asat the converging focus of the light channeled from the four 5-foot windowpassages. Theeffect is devastating. One shimmers with light from the Sun, Moon, or stars inanotherwise shadowed and darkened chamber; and one’s voice whether lowered to awhisper or raised to a shout is magnified and multiplied and mirrored back tothe focus.Upon returning to the medieval museum rooms with the curator, I enquired whetherImight be able to spend some time in the Hall of the Dead alone. To my surpriseheassented, providing that I sign in the logbook for the key. I did so, returnedalone to theHall, locked myself in, and undertook what I shall henceforth refer to as theWewelsburgWorking. It is discussed in a separate paper.Late in the afternoon I closed the chamber, returned the key to the curator, anddeparted for Frankfurt and the rest of the World of Horrors.Subsequently I had the opportunity to visit the Obersalzberg complex. Havingwrittenabout it in Secret of the Lost Ark, I was frankly curious to see if mydescription squaredwith reality. I am pleased to report that it does.Adolf Hitler’s own house - the Berghof - is now so completely overgrown withforestthat it’s impossible to find it unless you know where to look. [It took me ahalf-hour’splunging around in the underbrush]. On Walpurgis 1952 the ruins of the Berghofweredynamited by the German government; only one partially-underground room remains.Back in San Francisco I am now recovering from jet-lag, reading mail, andponderingmany things.The Wewelsburg WorkingDate/Time: October 19, XVII/3:00-4:30 PM.Location: Hall of the Dead/Walhalla, North Tower, Wewelsburg Castle, Westphalia,Germany.Key:19th Part of the Word of Set, Æthyr LIL.Purposes:• To obtain a full Understanding of the significance of the crisis that befelltheTemple of Set in June-July XVII.• To energize the advent of the Working Year XVIII.- 88 -• As the Wewelsburg was conceived by Heinrich Himmler to be the “Mittelpunkt derWelt”, and as the focus of the all of the Dead was to be the Gate of thatCenter, tosummon the Powers of Darkness at their most powerful locus.Results:What emerged from this Working was not a written text, such as the Book ofComingForth by Night or the Word of Set, but rather a twofold sensation: First, thesuction-likeimpression of the inflow of certain realizations and kinds of knowledge(accompanied byan almost “electrical” sort of exhilaration), which seemed to have “remaineddormant”pending an “activating” Working of this sort. Second, an extended“reverberation” or“echoing” of the focus of this Working within the Walhalla, culminating in itssending-forth into the material world.The central features of the various principal occultisms of the 19th and 20thcenturiesCE ran through my consciousness almost as a pageant. I understood the object ofthis tobe an exposure of contrasts, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies a vast, spiralingdialecticdesigned to clear away the debris of sectarianism and superficiality in thesearch for thekey principles of the true Powers of Darkness.Concepts of “will”, “intelligence”, “self-consciousness”, “initiation”, and“magic”appeared in turn and fell aside as well; I saw them as useful, but still,surprisingly,peripheral to the central concept being approached. When at last all veils hadbeenremoved, and that concept was revealed, it was so simple as to seem at firstanticlimacticand almost disappointing. It was: the phenomenon of life.Instantly I regretted my impatience and arrogance, my lapse into easydisappointment. Too many doors had been opened, too many forces unlocked andunleashed for this to be the ultimate impact of the Working. Then it was asthough a “test”were passed: The basic concept of “life” became a sort of focal point, like thatof arefractor telescope, through which the energies of the Working passed. Theinitial“dialectic” had reduced all to a pinpoint of fact, and now that fact,unencumbered, wasexpanding to full significance.Human beings are accustomed to thinking of “nature” as including all animate andinanimate life forms, themselves included. It was the approach of the Church ofSatan,and later of the Temple of Set, to single out self-consciousness as thecharacteristic featureof That which stood in contrast to the harmony of the natural cosmos. In factall life hassome degree of intelligence [not to be confused with self-consciousness], andsomewherewithin that intelligence is a subcomponent of self-consciousness, which onlybecomesevident when the level of basic intelligence is relatively high.The error in any operation designed to strengthen the self-consciousnessnecessarilyfollows from the fact that self-consciousness is a function of the coreintelligence, andthere are many other functions of intelligence as well. Initiation thus treats a“symptom”, not a “cause”; this leads the “cure” in unanticipated directions.The Church of Satan and the Temple of Set have grappled with this problem forall theyears of their existence without recognizing its actual depth. Strengthen,exalt, andencourage the willful self, and you cannot avoid strengthening the naturalinstincts aswell. No human being is free from these; they may be kept in check for years,but ineventual moments of stress, weakness, or stimulus they will break free. They maybeeither creative or destructive; this is not a mere “Jekyll/Hyde” scenario.All initiatory efforts that are not deliberate frauds from the most childish tothe mostsophisticated are conceits of the self-conscious intellect. Those that professto be natural,- 89 -universal, nirvanic, or otherwise “Right-Hand Path” are ultimately exercises inself-delusion, if in fact the adherents actually believe in their own rhetoric.Sooner or later themasquerade becomes tiresome, the daydream boring, and the devotee discards it infavorof other sensory stimuli.The anti-natural systems of the “left-Hand Path”, on the other hand, think tosuppresssome aspects of the intellect while strengthening others. What results is acondition ofstrain which, should the tension become too great, will snap back to anequilibrium whichmay be more or less viable than it originally was.The intelligent mind cannot be “escaped” so easily. If it is argued, convinced,threatened, hypnotized, drugged, or diseased into non-rational channels, thenits self-consciousness will merely reassert itself in some other form. This, I understoodin theWewelsburg, was the “magical epitaph” of Nazi Germany: That, in fighting againstcertainfeatures of the mind, it had seemed at first to succeed but then had thusunleashed other,even less desirable features of that same mind which had previously remained insomerough degree of socially-controlled equilibrium before this ultimatelydisastrousexperiment in “conscious evolution” was attempted.The chamber in which I stood, I now realized, was nothing less than an SSlaboratoryfor experiments in “conscious evolution” - a sort of “Krel machine” withoutcomputerized,science-fiction accouterments. It was not designed to teach or educate, ratherto mirrorand enhance thoughts and impulses already in existence. Hence its effect on theconsciousness could be devastating for better or for worse.The 18-year experience of the Church of Satan and Temple of Set now began toappearin a new perspective. Anton LaVey had thought to enhance conscious evolution byfreeingthe mind from self-imposed emotional prisons. He did so, enjoyed a measure ofsuccess,yet saw to his increasing dismay that new and more uncontrollable prisons wereerectedin their place.Whereas the initial ones had been socially imposed, however, resulting in mindsmoreor less tractable in society, these replacements were the product of random,unforeseen,intellectual imbalances. In a few cases the results were those of at leasttemporary genius.More often, however, the results were tragically self-destructive.Anton LaVey erred in blaming the organization of the Church of Satan for this.Thatorganization per se was not at fault; if anything it was a stabilizinginfluence. When hedecided to exploit the organization in 1975, those working coherently within itfeltwronged, said so, and formed the Temple of Set.The Temple of Set was intended to be the perfect initiatory organization. Itexploitedno one; it offered every conceivable opportunity to everyone. Its most valuableinheritance from the Church of Satan was a commitment to the rejection ofnonsense,occult or otherwise. The future, it seemed, was a banquet of intellectualevolution at whichto feast.Yet the Temple too began to suffer shock after shock, as often as not caused byseniorInitiates. At first these were explained as freak events and blamed upon theinadequaciesof the individuals in question. But as the phenomenon happened again and again,thisseemed more an excuse than an explanation. Finally, in the summer of XVII, aconspiracyby several senior Initiates to pervert and degrade the Temple was only barelyexposed andstopped in time. But the damage was devastating, if not indeed fatal - not tothe structureitself, but to the assumptions concerning initiation which had formed the basisof thatstructure.The Temple of Set’s soaring hopes for the perfect initiatory medium, it seemed,hadbeen dashed. In curing the symptom which Anton LaVey had attacked, it hadthought to- 90 -solve the essential problem. But, just as he had focused his anger and contempton thewrong thing, so the Temple had poured its trust and confidence into animprovement ofthat same wrong thing. The actual culprit - the disproportionately “evolved”intellect -escaped the clear comprehension of both.The forces that would lead to the destruction of the Church of Satan in 1975were notset in motion by Wayne West in 1971; they were activated on Walpurgisnacht I.Similarlythe Temple of Set, thinking that it had destroyed those forces in 1975, hadsucceeded onlyin closing certain doors to them so that they would have to find other means ofmanifestation. After an initial delay, they did.Now, in the Hall of the Dead, I sought a solution to the dilemma of the 18-yearWorking. Is the lesson of I-XVIII ultimately that there is no way out - that allinitiationis merely Russian roulette in fancy dress?But here the Understanding that had so far come so powerfully and clearly failedme.It was as though the Wewelsburg, having discharged a “battery” that had remainedcharged for 40 years, had no more current to provide.Having drunk at this magical fountain of youth, however, I myself felt energizedas Ihad not since the North Solstices of V and X. The Hall of the Dead now seemed aninsulation against random discharge of this energy. Action must now give way toreaction;how should I direct this reaction?In considering this, my attention came to rest on the concept of the Order oftheTrapezoid. As will be recalled, this concept as employed by both the Church andtheTemple has gone through many adjustments and redefinitions over the years. Yetit hasendured and attracted because it seemed to “say something” that the Church andtheTemple could not. What might this be?During those periods when it was not employed as a synonym for the Priesthood,theOrder has been used as a talisman to evoke a kind of diabolical Schadenfreude, agrimenjoyment of the predicament of self-conscious humanity. “Here you are in astate ofSatanic self-awareness,” it seemed to say. “You cannot escape it; you cannotchange it forthe better or for the worse. Therefore: Experience it; savor its taste, senseits exquisitepain and pleasure. Do not wallow in it like an animal in warm mud; rather cut itas youwould a fine gem, and behold the brilliance of its facets.”When singing this song of Lorelei, the Order has seemed oddly antithetical totheChurch of Satan and Temple of Set, both of which incorporated the premise ofself-awareness but which then promised different types of escape, change, andimprovement[thus the justification for affiliation, as well as the success-barometer of thedegreesystem]. As an “Ur-Doppelgänger” of these creative institutions, however, theOrder’sname and presence has waxed with their setbacks and waned with their successes.It isnot an “evil antithesis” as much as it is a mirrored image - an alternatesetting for theGraal of the Prince of Darkness.Here in the Hall of the Dead, Heinrich Himmler’s Sanctum Sanctorum and“Mittelpunkt der Welt”, was the Earthly focus of That which has been thussymbolized bythe Order of the Trapezoid. The reality of this chamber rushed in upon me. Thiswas noHollywood set, no ordinary room painted and decorated to titillate the senses.1,285inmates of the Niederhagen concentration camp died during the reconstruction oftheWewelsburg for the SS. If the Marble Hall and the Walhalla were memorials to acertainunique quality in mankind, they also serve as grisly reminders of the penaltywhichmankind pays for that quality.I saw before me the sigil of the Order of the Trapezoid as originally designedby AntonLaVey: the pentagram within a trapezoid extending slightly below the two lowerpoints,- 91 -the three curved 6s, the trident rising from the flames of Hell. I saw its laterdesign in theChurch, the 6s and the flames now gone. I saw its first design in the Temple ofSet: theTcham scepter with the head and forked tail of Set replacing the Satanictrident. I sawRonald Barrett’s subsequent concept: a simple pentagram with the four upperpointsconnected.So now the principle should be completed - the Law of the Trapezoid finally andcompletely fused into its emblem. There appeared then the Sigil of the Order asreproduced here. It is a return to the initial Sigil, with the followingchanges: The curved-line fires of Hell are replaced by the Black Flame, whose emanations are rays,notflickering tongues. There are nine rays, each in strict mathematical proportionto thepentagram or trapezoid. The source-point of the Black Flame completes thepentagram, ascalled for in the Book of Coming Forth by Night. Two of the rays of the Flamecompletethe inverse pentagon about the pentagram, creating a total of nine GoldenSectiontrapezoids in the entire sigil. The three 6s are restored, but with no curvedlines. The Set-headed and -tailed Tcham scepter of ancient Khem rises from the Black Flame, itshead atthe center of the pentagram. Its tail, against the three central rays of theFlame, forms a“W”, denoting the “Walhalla” or Hall of the Dead at Schloss Wewelsburg, theGreat Gateof the Powers of Darkness in our Time.The direction of the Working’s reaction seemed clear before me; I thus castforth thefull existence of the Order of the Trapezoid into the world. After 18 years theKey has beenforged in the Word of Set, and the Gate of the Wewelsburg is opened.Where the Church of Satan and Temple of Set have appeared, so has the shadow ofThat signified by the Order been reflected. Now it has been loosed in its fullforce.Whether or not the sacred Priesthood continues to exist, the Order will do so:for itsrelease is an inevitable legacy of the I-XVIII Working. Mankind received theutopianvisions of the Church of Satan and Temple of Set only as it strived to be worthyof them; itwill continue to receive them only as it continues to prove itself so worthy.But the Order of the Trapezoid, whether known by its true name or by countlessothers, will always exist - not as a visible institution, but as a principle inthe intelligentmind. Anton Szandor LaVey’s Law of the Trapezoid will endure as well: Those whorecognize the principle will be able to turn it to their deliberate use [whetherto theirultimate benefit or detriment]; those who do not will nonetheless be subject toit [whetherto their ultimate benefit or detriment].So It Is Done.Soon thereafter I announced the reformation of the Order of the Trapezoid in theCrystalTablet of Set:[index-92_1.jpg]- 92 -Order of the TrapezoidWhen once the restraining talisman of the Christian cross is broken in Germany,thenthe fury of the ancient warriors, the berserk rage of which the Nordic poetssang, will surgeup again. The old stone gods will rise from long-forgotten ruins and rub thedust of athousand years from their eyes; and Thor with his giant hammer will leap up andsmashthe Gothic cathedrals. And when that crash comes, it will be like nothing heardbefore inhistory. - Heinrich Heine, 1834The “mainstream” of the Western magical tradition may be said to have aMediterranean origin: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome - and the latersynthesesof these ancient cultures through the Medieval, Renaissance, and Enlightenmenteras.In marked contrast to the Mediterranean tradition is the school of thought whichoriginated in the northern areas of Europe and Scandinavia: the Nordic orGermanictradition. Most notable in this tradition, of course, is its lack of featureseither derivativeof Judaeo/Christianity or prior to and prototypical of it. The Germanicmetaphysicsdeveloped in an alien environment, remained largely isolated from theMediterraneaninfluence during the Roman Empire, and were suppressed rather than assimilatedduringthe Christian centuries which followed.It was in the late 19th century CE that this ancient Germanic tradition returnedto playmore than a mere mythological part in European affairs. It is perhaps notsurprising thatit surfaced during the Second Reich of Kaiser Wilhelm I and Otto von Bismarck.Untiltheir unification by Prussia, the Germanic states had been weak and unstable incomparison to the larger nation-states of the continent. Periodically ravaged byforeignarmies, Germany had earned the unenviable title of the “battleground of Europe”.The 19th century heralded the onset of a new movement in European culture:Romanticism. It was a reaction to and a rejection of the methodical, practical -but just asoften frustrating and stifling - scientific materialism which had resulted fromtheindustrial revolution. In its original, more transcultural sense, Romanticismimplieduninhibited individualism. In German, however, it gripped the imagination to asomewhat deeper degree. Gustau Pauli, in Dehio’s Geschichte der deutschen Kunst(1919-1934), states:Romanticism is Germanic and reached its purest expression in those territorieswhichare most free from Roman colonization. Everything that is regarded as anessential aspectof the romantic spirit: irrationalism, the mystic welding-together of subjectand object, thetendency to intermingle the arts, the longing for the faraway and the strange,the feelingfor the infinite and the continuity of historic development - all these arecharacteristic ofGerman Romanticism, and so much so that their union remains unintelligible totheLatins. What is known as Romanticism in France has only its name in common withGerman Romanticism.- 93 -Crucial also to German Romanticism were the concepts of dynamism and life-worship. The former term represents an urge towards constant movement andevolution, whether intellectual, artistic, or social. It differs from the Setianconcept ofXeper in that Romantic dynamism is non-Platonic; it is supra-rational ratherthan guidedby logic, ethics, and nœtic apprehension.German Romantic life-worship was not love and respect for the phenomenon of lifeper se, but rather a compulsion to exercise one’s own life - to “really live”rather than tosimply exist. Again this is commendable, but as with dynamism it can bedangerous inexcess - when one’s “rage to live” interrupts and consumes the lives of others.The uncanny attraction of the Third Reich - Nazi Germany - lies in the fact thatitendorsed and practiced both dynamism and life-worship without restraint and to aworld-shaking degree of success. In The Revolution of Nihilism (1939), HermanRauschningsaid:This irrational element in National Socialism is the actual source of itsstrength. It isthe reliance on it that accounts for its “sleepwalker’s immunity” in the face ofone practicalproblem after another. It explains why it was possible for National Socialism toattainpower almost without the slightest tangible idea of what it was going to do. Themovementwas without even vague general ideas on the subject; all it had was boundlessconfidence:things would smooth themselves out one way or another ... Its strength lay inincessantactivity and in embarking on anything so long as it kept things moving ...NationalSocialism is action pure and simple, dynamics in vacuo, revolution at a variabletempo,ready to be changed at any moment.Similarly the life-worship of the Third Reich was not what the “Mediterranean”mindunderstands by this term. The “life” is the life of the state, or more preciselythe Volk(perhaps best translated as the “soul of the people”). The individual achievesself-realization as, through his efforts, he contributes to the strengthening of this“soul”.Just as the Third Reich’s dynamism got out of hand, leading it to embark onirrationaland destructive foreign invasions, so its life-worship - which could have been atrulyevolutionary synthesis of the most sublime concepts of Hegel and Nietzsche -becameperverted into crude xenophobia, hatreds built upon superficial notions of“race”, andultimately a maddened stampede towards a Wagnerian Götterdämmerung in defianceofa return to rationalism. Said Heinrich Himmler on April 21, 1945:We have made serious mistakes. If I could have a fresh start, I would do manythingsdifferently now. But it is too late. We wanted greatness and security forGermany, and weare leaving behind us a pile of ruins, a fallen world ...The Order of the Trapezoid (O.Tr.) extracts the positive, the constructive, theexalted,and the Romantic from the Germanic magical tradition - and just as carefullyavoids andrejects those excesses, distortions, and cruelties which have made thistradition an objectof the most extraordinary fear, condemnation, and suppression in the postwarperiod.The Germanic tradition is also part of the legacy of the Prince of Darkness,hence isappropriate to an Order within the Temple of Set, which embraces allmanifestations ofthe Powers of Darkness in the world.Nevertheless the care required in any investigation into this tradition cannotbeoveremphasized. Magical and research ability are not enough; ethical sensitivityandsocial discretion are just as important. The prospects for new and wondrousperspectiveson the Black Art are exhilarating, but success will come only if the Orderconducts its- 94 -affairs with the same dedication and nobility that have made the Temple of Set alegend inits time.Lineage of the OrderThe O.Tr. was founded as an informal Order within the Church of Satan by theauthority of Anton Szandor LaVey as High Priest. Its existence was firstannounced in theDecember V/1970 Cloven Hoof:The O.Tr. is the “board of directors” and security staff of the Church. Itsfunctions aremany, and its members are chosen by appointment, according to the specialabilities andattributes of each. All Priests and Priestesses are automatically admitted intothe Order,although the identities of most members of the Order are unknown even to eachother.Members of the Governing or Grand Council of the Trapezoid are known only to theHighPriest, who solicits their aid when required.There was a strong Germanic element in the rituals of the early Church of Satan,deriving from the musical imagery of Richard Wagner and from the visual imageryofWeimar-era Expressionism (Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig). The significance of thetrapezoid itself came from its suggestion of perspective and the distortion ofthatperspective in such UFA films as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and The Golem. Fromritualuse of similar angles and planes in such ceremonies as “Die ElektrischenVorspiele” [inThe Satanic Rituals], Anton LaVey made observations culminating in his “Law oftheTrapezoid”:All obtuse angles are magically harmful to those unaware of this property. Thesameangles are beneficial, stimulating, and energizing to those who are magicallysensitive tothem.In the December V/1970 Cloven Hoof article, five literary sources for thisprinciplewere identified: William Mortensen’s The Command to Look, Louis McCarty’s TheGreatPyramid Jeezeh, Sheila Ostrander & Lynn Schroeder’s Psychic Discoveries BehindtheIron Curtain (Chapter 27), Frank Belknap Long’s The Hounds of Tindalos, and H.P.Lovecraft’s The Haunter of the Dark. The Council of the Trapezoid, alternativelyidentified as the Council of Nine, was in fact an informal, unofficial cabinetwithout fixedmembership, terms, functions, or binding authority. In X/1975 it attained formalstatus asthe corporate board of directors and supreme executive body of the Temple ofSet.Apart from early Council meetings, which ceased ca. late 1970, no Order meetingsorfunctions distinct from those of the Priesthood were held in the Church ofSatan. In VI theOrder was officially defined as comprising the III°-V° initiates within theChurch, i.e. thecollective Satanic Priesthood. In 1973 Anton LaVey again reconstituted theOrder, thistime to identify significant contributors to and representatives of the Satanictradition,within or without the formal Church and Priesthood. Again there were nomeetings,functions, or publications of this Order.From 1975 to 1979 the Order was again used as an alternate designation for alldegreeswithin the Priesthood of Set, and at the Set-I Conclave in 1979 the Council ofNinereplaced the Satanic trident in its emblem with the Tcham sceptre of Set. At theSet-IIIConclave in 1981 the Order was once again reconstituted, this time as anhonorarydesignation for all present and past members of the Council of Nine, and itsemblem wascondensed to a pentagram within a trapezoid.- 95 -In the Walhalla or “Hall of the Dead” at Castle Wewelsburg, Westphalia - thesubterranean sanctum sanctorum of the German castle which Heinrich Himmler hadreconstructed for his own Workings in the Black Art - Michael A. Aquino VI°,High Priestof Set, conducted a Working on October 19, 1982. One of the results of thisWorking wasthe reconstitution of the O.Tr. as a truly functioning Order under the authorityof theTemple of Set.The O.Tr. is an Order of knighthood characterized by strict personal honor andfaithfulness to the quest for the Grail. The Order is a knighthood in that itsmembers arepledged to the traditional chivalric virtues as appropriate to each situationencountered.By honor is meant a sense of justice, ethics, and responsibility prior topersonal comfort,convenience, or advantage. This honor is known by one’s faithfulness to theQuest forthe Grail, which is the self, soul, or psyche made perfect through consciousrefinementand exercise of the will. Attainment of the Grail results in transformation ofthe individualinto a state of dynamic existence energized by the psyche, not by the physicalbodyderived from the objective universe. Hence the O.Tr. is the gate topsychecentricimmortality beyond physical death.The insignia of the O.Tr. is an inverse pentagram whose four upper points definethelimits and angles of a phi-trapezoid. From the nethermost point of the pentagramradiatesthe Black Flame of Set, whose nine tongues signify the Council of Nine andcomplete theangular relationships of the pentagram and trapezoid. Rising from the BlackFlame is aTcham sceptre, symbol of Pharaonic authority in ancient Egypt, bearing the headandforked tail of Set. The sceptre faces to the left, symbolic of the Left-HandPath of BlackMagic. The space between the Black Flame and the Tcham sceptre forms the letter“W”,signifying Walhalla. This is both the name of the chamber in the Wewelsburg,Westphaliawherein the Order was consecrated; and the famous hall of eternal life to whichancientTeutonic heroes were brought by the Walkyries and admitted by Wotan. Thus theletter“W” has a fivefold meaning (including the Motto of the Order) in addition to itsprimaryreference. In the topmost three gaps between the pentagram and the trapezoid arethenumbers 666, symbolic of the Prince of Darkness and of the First and SecondBeastsrevealed of him. The three sixes add to XVIII ÆS, the first Working Yearfollowing thecreation of the Church of Satan, and the year in which the O.Tr. was returned tolife. Inthe entire emblem there are no curved lines, signifying the Black Magical powerofangular relationships and the Law of the Trapezoid. It is further mathematicallykeyed tothe phi-ratio.AdmissionAdmission to the O.Tr. is by invitation only. To be considered, one must firstachievethe degree of Adept II° in the Temple of Set, and evidence a sufficientlycomprehensiveinvolvement in the Temple as a whole to preclude over-concentration in themagicalphilosophy of the Order.As a general policy Oaths of the Order will be administered in a lodge setting,either atConclaves of the Temple of Set or at lodges of the Order presided over by thelodge-masteror a Master of the O.Tr. Masters of the O.Tr. may authorize special alternativearrangements as necessary.[index-96_1.png]- 96 -Runes is the newsletter of the O.Tr. It is named in honor of the Runennewsletter ofthe Germanen Orden, an esoteric society in pre- and post-World War I Germany.TheFenris Wolf on its masthead comes from ancient north European mythology. Fenriswasone of the dæmonic offspring of Loki, and the brother of Hel and of the MidgardSerpent.Growing up in Asgard among the gods, he eventually became so huge and fiercethat thegods decided to bind him. The only cord which could hold Fenris was made of theelements of the Earth by the dwarves. It was said that at Ragnarök, the end oftimes,Fenris would break free. According to the Völuspa (ca. 9th century CE), a textfromNorway and Iceland:The chains that hold the Fenris Wolf are rent asunder, and the Wolf coursesabout.Brothers shall fight and slay one another; sisters’ sons shall break the bondsof kinship. Itshall fare hard with the world: great whoredom, an axe-age, a sword-age, shieldsshall becloven, a wind-age, a wolf-age, ere the world sinks in ruin. No man shall sparethe other.Fenris as Runes’ masthead thus symbolizes the Powers of Darkness temporarilyconstrained by the objective universe. It is also a reminder that the price ofloosing theWolf - to energize evolutionary consciousness in humanity - is to risk chaos inthe naturalorder by lesser humanity’s misuse of its power over nature. This is the Æon ofSet, whenthe human psyche can soar free of its animalistic fetters; but it is also awolf-age in whichmuch of the planet suffers through human carelessness and callousness - theresult ofcorruption of the powers of high intelligence. The O.Tr. seeks to allow Fenristo run free inhis magnificence - as the Prince of Darkness created him - but further to showthat hisfreedom through initiation of the Will will exalt, not debase mankind. Theartisticrendition of Fenris is reproduced from the cover of the August 1941 issue ofGermanien,official journal of the Ahnenerbe, the elite section of the SS concerned withthe theory andpractice of the Black Arts.Let none who fearsThe spear of WotanAdventure across this fire!- Richard Wagner, Die WalküreIf the scope of the Temple of Set weren’t already broad enough, I think it canbe seen herethat that of the O.Tr. added several more extensions and dimensions to it. [Andthis was just thefirst of many new and highly-sophisticated/highly-visionary Orders.] Whereas thecultural andiconographic orientation of the Temple had previously taken its inspiration fromancient Egypt,the O.Tr. had now opened the door to the equally vast, and in many ways evenless-studied andmore-obscure metaphysics of ancient northern Europe. Particularly ominous inthis was thatNazi Germany, and especially its feared SS, had also taken especial interest inthis same area of- 97 -archæological, philosophical, and magical research, and it was obvious that theO.Tr. would bereopening some of the same doors that had been slammed shut by the rest of theworld onWalpurgisnacht 1945.Well, until this problem could be carefully and constructively addressed, theOrder hadplenty of other avenues of interest to explore and enjoy, among these scientificmagic (includingmad scientists and their mad laboratories), architectural magic (haunted housesandLovecraftian geometry), and artistic magic (particularly in such fields asExpressionism, noir,and Art Deco). This was going to be fun, not just for the Order, but for thewhole Temple!Runes spent its initial years as a Temple-wide newsletter, mailed out onalternating months fromthe Scroll, and a sampling of some of my articles for it during that timeappears here asAppendices #58-65.As interesting and entertaining as such an Indiana Jones romp through theTwilight Zonemight be, it was also conspicuously clear that this new Order of the Trapezoid’sGermanic-loreroots were very shallow, extending back little farther than the Romanticism ofWagner and theArt Nouveau/Deco/Expressionism of the early 20th century. I tracked down andcombedthrough a good deal of Ahnenerbe-SS documents in the Library of Congress and theU.S.National Archives microfilm files, but exclusive reliance on Nazi research intoGermanicantiquity was precarious. The SS obviously had an ideological agenda to maximizeand glamorizethe “Aryan” myth, and Ahnenerbe historians and archæologists who wished careeradvancementknew what they were expected to find. [This of course is the same in any othercommunitywishing to polish its pedigree, but Heinrich Himmler was pushing against 2,000years of Judæo-Christian worldwide indoctrination, and a mere 12 years (the last half of whichwas complicatedby World War II) was not enough to break through even the less-factually-basedbastions of“established” academia.]More than once in the odyssey of the Temple of Set [and indeed the Church ofSatan beforeit], an individual, event, or circumstance has appeared at precisely the momentit was needed.“Once,” said Auric Goldfinger to James Bond, “is happenstance. Twice iscoincidence. The thirdtime it’s enemy action.” In our case it might not be “enemy” action, but as suchcatalyticphenomena have continued to proliferate to our furtherance and improvement, onemight wellappreciate in them the hand of the Prince of Darkness.On January 13, 1984 the Temple of Set received the following letter:Order of the Shining TrapezoidAustin, TexasHail Keepers of the Temple!Recently a relatively small but dedicated circle of people here have begun asemiformalSatanic working group. Our basis has generally been the system of the Church ofSatan, of which Ihave been a member. However the particular constellation of elements which seemto be presentin the workings of the Temple of Set are very interesting to me - especiallysince I have extensiveknowledge of and experience in various schools of German occultism [and I havealso been amember of the Armanen Order in Germany].Information that you could send us would be appreciated. I am sure that we haveinformationin which you would probably be interested, but at this point we are mainlyintrigued by the systemof the Temple of Set with an eye toward perhaps joining and aiding in itsdevelopment. We arelooking forward to hearing from you, and anticipate the day when we can begin towork togetherin earnest.Heil Satan-Wotan!PolarisOur information was duly sent, and on February 2 Polaris (Stephen Edred Flowers)replied:- 98 -Dear Priestess Ford, Executive Director,First let me thank you for your prompt reply of January 20th to my letter, andfor theimpressive material you sent. I and my closest associate here were both veryexcited by the natureof the work of the Temple of Set and Order of the Trapezoid.In view of the quality of the work, we have decided to disband the Order of theShiningTrapezoid and to plight our troth with the complex represented by the Temple. Iam very muchlooking forward to learning from the Temple as well as contributing to it.With this letter and enclosure I formally seek admittance into the Temple ofSet. My personalphilosophy, and that which I have always espoused is now, and shall ever be, intrue harmony withthe Setian stream and that of Wotan-Satan. As to my background notes, I havetried to summarizethem in the various enclosures: (1) a regular academic viæ, (2) a chronologicalrun-down ofperiods in which studies in occult/magical disciplines were undertaken, and (3)a brief statementof philosophical positions with regard to Setian philosophy and Wodenism andtheir synthesis.This makes clear my reasons for wanting to join the Temple of Set.As soon as I receive confirmation of my acceptance, I will begin sending alongsome othermaterial as a start on my contribution to the information-base of the Temple andthe Order of theTrapezoid. I think that this will be vast enough that it must be approached on asystematic basis(how Teutonic!). The first step in this process should probably be an annotatedbibliography of therelevant books and other materials in my archives. From this you can cull whatyou think of use,and we can work on ways of making this available to you. Also I will of coursemake available toyou all of my own works (some of them unpublished) ...With best wishes,PolarisOn March 26th I responded:That bibliography you sent is certainly a gold mine! I doubt that SanFrancisco’s Goethe-Institut library will include anything so esoteric, but U.C. Berkeley’s library- where I periodicallygo book-hunting, having faculty stacks privileges - offers better prospects. [Itwas there that Icame across Michael Kater’s 1966 CE Heidelberg thesis Das “Ahnenerbe” der SS1935-1945: einBeitrag zur Kulturpolitik des Dritten Reichs (Stuttgart, DeutscheVerlags-Anstalt, 1974), whichhas been no end of help to me in untangling the rather bewildering history ofthat organization.]I expect to be in Washington this June, hence will also be able to hit theLibrary of Congress.[As soon as I become really good at teleportation, I intend to move it to SanFrancisco.]I am frankly astonished [and pleased, because of the opportunities therebycreated] at howmany of the works on your list I haven’t read! Some of this material iscrisscrossed, I presume, byvarious works on the Temple of Set Reading List, but obviously primary sourcesare far better towork with. I agree with your assessment of Satan and Swastika, which accountsfor its absencefrom the Reading List. There were one or two articles concerning theExternsteine in theGermanien issues I perused in the L.C. during my last Washington trip, but Ididn’t happen toXerox them. [I did make copies of other Germanien articles for possible O.Tr.use, together withquite a few papers and articles from the Ahnenerbe microfilm in the NationalArchives. But themicrofilm printing machines in the N.A. are in such terrible shape that theAhnenerbe material,which is already in less-than-ideal condition, came out only barely readable. AsI have a chance tomake some sense of the reams of thermofax (ugh!) which I did produce, it will besurfacing inRunes.I found the Phelps article on one of my raids in the U.C.B. library, and agreethat it is a gem.[No thanks to the confusing volume-numbering system of the Journal of ModernHistory!]Sebbotendorf’s Bevor Hitler Kam itself was not in the stacks, so I have coastedon Phelps’summary in that particular area.Otherwise your list looks so terribly fascinating that I’m not quite certainwhere to dig first.Your suggestions as to priorities would be welcome.I further admired Runa #I-1 and thank you for sending it. You write with a mostunusualmixture of high scholarship and applied-magical motive, which is very refreshingand stimulatingto readers who are both scholars and magicians. But I miss my guess if youdidn’t scare off bothnon-scholarly magicians and non-magician scholars with this unique approach. Inthe O.Tr.,- 99 -hopefully, you will find a medium receptive to and appreciative of bothqualities. And I’m certainyour own influence in the Order will help it to become even more sophisticatedin that sense.I look forward to the MS of your Primer of Rune-Magic and of course to yourFuthark, whichI anticipate will fill a great need in this particular area. From my comments inRunes to date, Iexpect you’ve deduced my general disappointment with the existing works onrunes. Some arefairly good, but none really deals with the subject comprehensively, yet in away which isintelligible and interesting to the lay reader ...Just what sophistication Stephen Flowers (who shortly thereafter received hisPh.D. inGermanic History from the University of Texas) brought to the Order of theTrapezoid’sNorthern-European lore aspect can be glimpsed from Category 24 “Runic Arts &Sciences” of theTemple of Set Reading List (Appendix #12). He succeeded me as Runes Editor in1986, then asGrand Master of the Order of the Trapezoid in 1987. As can be imagined, thefocus of the Orderduly sharpened towards Northern esotericism, Runic lore, and a more traditionalapproachtowards its chivalric dimension. My wide-ranging Runes investigations into themore obscure,suppressed, and startling areas of technomagic and fringe science were, perhapsthankfully, arelic of the past.The Order of the Trapezoid has continued to the time of this writing as one ofthe mostprolific Orders of the Temple of Set, both through Runes articles and numeroussymposia,presentations, and workshops both separately and together with Temple conclaves.Today, underits current Grand Master Sir Eric Kauschen, the Order has expanded to aninternationalpresence, with an Internet presence, lodges, and activities in many countries.It has undeniablyset a new standard for the concept of a religion-based order of knighthood interms of the depthand intensity of its esoteric and initiatory focus. Nothing like it has beenseen since the days ofthe original Knights Templar.As for the Wewelsburg Working, not only did it recreate the Order of theTrapezoid, it alsoinspired renewed interest in the Wewelsburg by many other occult organizationsas well. In herarticle about the Order of the Trapezoid in the definitive 2009 anthology DieSS, Himmler unddie Wewelsburg Daniela Siepe, Historian of the official Kreismuseum Wewelsburgat the castle,commented:Since the Temple of Set there have been many other groups interested in theWewelsburg,most with teachings of wholly different interpretations. The Church of Satanclaims to have had a“Totenkopf Grotto” focused on the castle 1995-1996. In the Ruhr region thereexists a local Circleof Hagalaz Coming Forth, an informal association without activities at thecastle. In Switzerlandthere is the Black Order of Luzifer, which views the Wewelsburg as the“schwarzmagischeGralsburg (Black Magical Grail Castle)”, devoting considerable attention tofolkish ideas. Outsidethe [now permanently locked] entrance to the Gruft (the Walhalla) was once foundthe remains ofa ritual - bread, water, a floral bouquet, and a candle - alluding to a seasonalritual of nature-worshipping neopagans. Finally, in esoteric guidebooks such as Magisch ReisenDeutschlandfrom the renowned Goldmann-verlag publishers, interested persons can learn aboutthe esotericreasons why the National Socialists chose buildings such as the Wewelsburg atspecial “points ofenergy” to draw in magic to the entire area. But it is only possible to knowwhich visitors to thecastle are attracted by this when they provide written records to theWewelsburg, or appear to beperforming a ritual there.In 2010 the Kreismuseum contacted the Temple of Set concerning a new exhibitionon thehistory of the Wewelsburg since 1945, to include the Wewelsburg Working and theOrder of theTrapezoid. This resulted in an even more massive historical catalogue,Endzeitkämpfer Ideologieund Terror der SS (Berlin: Deutscher KJunstverlag, 2011), an appreciative copyof which wassent to me by the Kreismuseum. It appears that the castle and the Order have acontinuingfriendship into their mysterious and magical future.- 100 -[index-101_1.jpg][index-101_2.jpg]- 101 -9: The Orders, Pylons, and ElementsThe OrdersThe Orders of the Temple of Set which came into being along with that of theTrapezoid wereno less remarkable and creative. Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that manyof them became asstrong, active, and both magically and philosophically challenging as the entireTemple of Sethad been during its first decade.The genius behind, inspiration for, and guiding hand over each Order has been,of course, theMaster of the Temple IV° who is its Grand Master. The concept for a specializedinitiatory Orderbeing a characteristic of this degree specifically dates back to AleisterCrowley’s Liber 418: TheVision and The Voice series of workings, in which the “Cry of the 13th Æthyr” ofDecember 4,1909 set forth the work of this initiatory state of being. It was this visionwith which Anton LaVeyritually formalized the IV° of the Church of Satan, and which I carried forwardthus for the IV° ofthe Temple of Set:And now there cometh a Daimon into the garden, but he hath not any of theattributes of theformer Daimons, for he is like a young man, dressed in robes of blue.And I said: Pleasant indeed is the garden, and light is the toil of tending it,and great is thereward.And he said: Bethink thee that NEMO hath beheld the face of Set.And I said: Are all gardens like unto this garden?And he waved his hand, and in the Aire across the valley appeared an island ofcoral, rosy,with green palms and fruit-trees, in the midst of the bluest of the seas.And he waved his hand again, and there appeared a valley shut in by mighty snowmountains,and in it were pleasant streams of water, rushing through, and broad rivers, andlakes coveredwith lilies.And he waved his hand again, and there was a vision, as it were of an oasis inthe desert.And again he waved his hand, and there was a dim country with grey rocks, andheather, andgorse, and bracken.And he waved his hand yet again, and there was a city, and a black housetherein, enclosed bywalls. This time the house opens, and I see in it a man in red and black,sitting in a silent andsecret chamber. His eyes are closed, yet he readeth from a great book,constantly. I hear what he isreading: “The words of the book are as the leaves of the flowers in the garden.Many indeed ofthese my songs shall go forth as maidens, but there is one among them, which oneI know not, thatshall be a man-child, whose name shall be NEMO, when he hath beheld the face ofthe Prince ofDarkness and Become as his Eye.”So we enter the Earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute darkness. Yetit is perfectlypossible to see in it, so that the minutest details do not escape us. And uponthe root of one flowerhe pours acid so that the root writhes as if in torture. And another he cuts,and the shriek is like- 102 -the shriek of a mandrake, torn up by the roots. And another he chars with fire,and yet another heanoints with oil.And I said: Heavy is the labor, but great indeed is the reward.And the young man answered me: He shall not see the reward; he tendeth thegarden.And I said: What shall come unto him?And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is it revealed by the letters thatare the totems ofthe stars, but only by the stars. The man of Earth is the adherent. The lovergiveth his life unto thework among men. The hermit goeth solitary, and giveth only of his light untomen.And I ask him: Why does he tell me that?And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself, for thou hast ponderedthereupon for manydays, and hast not found light. And now that thou art called NEMO, the answer toevery riddlethat thou hast not found shall spring up in thy mind, unsought. Who can tellupon what day aflower shall bloom?And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world, and that shall be thy garden. Andconcerningtime and death, thou hast naught to do with these things. For though a preciousstone be hiddenin the sands of the desert, it shall not heed for the wind of the desert,although it be but sand. Forthe worker of works hath worked thereupon; and because it is clear, it isinvisible; and because itis hard, it moveth not.All these words are heard by everyone that is called NEMO. And with that doth heapplyhimself to Understanding. And he must understand the virtue of the waters ofdeath, and he mustunderstand the virtue of the Sun and the wind, and of the worm that turneth theearth, and of thestars that roof in the garden. And he must understand the separate nature andproperty of everyflower, or how shall he tend his garden?Initiation to the IV° is characterized by what Crowley termed “entry into theCity of thePyramids”, an awareness and appreciation of the entire scope of the initiatoryenvironment(æon). The disposition of the Master becomes one of inherent enhancement of theæongenerally, but also as the interpreter of a unique perspective concerning it:the “tending of agarden” - which within the Æon of Set became the creation of an Order.And indeed the post-Set-IV atmosphere of a Setian Order was intended to begarden-like.Adepts II°+ cultivated them, planted and nourished workings within them, thenfreelydistributed their fruits throughout the Temple of Set generally. As their extentand sophisticationincreased, Orders generated their own Masters, some of whom would eventuallybecome theirsuccessive Grand Masters [or, if coincidentally attaining IV° initiation,alternatively envisionadditional Orders].Collectively all of the Orders of the Temple of Set began to “add flesh to thebones” of theÆon of Set: to reveal its implications and dimensions through images in manydifferent mirrors.Yet each Order also developed and refined a unique identity of its own, which itis doubtful thatthe Temple of Set generally could have formulated absent that particular Masterof the Temple.Each Order introduced itself to the Temple as a whole with a Statement in theCrystal Tabletof Set, and those of the twenty-two Orders during my High Priesthood areincluded here asAppendices #66-87. Each Order went on not only to hold its own activities, butto publishperiodicals and anthologies often extending to library-scope. Some of thismaterial would bereprinted in the Scroll of Set or the Jeweled Tablets, but for the most part itwas simply madeavailable to all Setians with a particular interest in the work of a givenOrder.The PylonsIn 1975, as part of the changeover from the Church of Satan, almost all of itslocal Grottostransitioned into the Temple of Set. The Satanic term “Grotto” (chosen by AntonLaVey to depicta part of the “great underground cavern of Hell”, so to speak), was obviously nolonger thematic.After some discussion we settled on the term “Pylon”, after the greattrapezoidal-pillared gates to- 103 -ancient Egyptian temples. As our local groups would in effect be “gateways” tothe Temple of Setas a whole, this seemed both appropriate and æsthetic.The old term “Grotto Leader” also went by the wayside. In keeping with theindividualisticemphasis of the Temple of Set, Setians weren’t to be “led” anywhere by anybody.We decidedupon “Sentinel” to designate the Priest or Adept to whose guardianship eachPylon was formallyentrusted.Pylons were originally conceived to be geographically localized, and most ofthem have been.But as individual membership in the Temple of Set grew worldwide over the years,andparticularly upon the appearance of the Internet, it was soon apparent that somePylons, basedupon shared interests and/or friendships, were going to extend as well. So therewere“correspondence Pylons”, originally and most famously/enduringly the Gates ofHell Pylon, andeventually just about any combination-of-factors Pylons imaginable. Their onecommon feature,besides II°/III° Sentinelship, was simply the desire of the Setians involved tocollaborate over anextended period of time, either generally or on topics of especial interest.So numerous and multifaceted have the Pylons been over the years that a detaileddescriptionof each one would double the size of this ebook, so I’ll just mention theirnames through myHigh Priesthood: Ab Anpu, Amon, Antewey, Anubis, Apeti, ArchDaimon Infernus,Asmodeus,Babalon, Ba-Neb-Tett, Bifrost, Black Diamond, Black Flame, Black Lotus, BlackPhœnix, BlackRing, Black Runa, Black Sun Rising, Blazing Star, Bull of Ombos, CanisPrometheus, Chaldean,Cirith Ungol, Dakshineshwar, Dark Crescent, Dark Star, Draconis, Eternal Flame,Eye of Erbeth,Fallen Angel, Fenris, Folkvangr, Gates of Albion, Gates of Ganzir, Gates ofHell, Hades,Hlidhskjalf, Infernus, Kalevala, Kali Yuga, Lapponia, Legion, Luciferian, Magog,Melek Taus,Metropolis, Mut, Nan Madol, Nephilim, Nephren-Ka, Nuit’s Arch, Nyarlathotep,ObsidianGateway, Pan, Pesh-Khent, Promethean, Prometheus (Germany), Prometheus (Oregon,USA),Rising Force, Sa en Ankh, Sekhmet’s Oasis, Set Amentet, Seven Stars, SilverSpear, SmokingMirror, Tower of Belial, Tuatha de Danann, Tuonela, Ultima Thule, Ur, Urorm,Venificoperæ,Victory, Xem, Xronos, and Yidniminkani. The descriptions and histories of theseare generallyfound in the Crystal Tablet of Set and the Temple’s various Internet resources;and of coursemany of them contributed to the Scroll of Set and published their ownnewsletters and papers aswell.The ElementsThe term “Element” originated somewhat humorously. By the 1980s the Temple ofSet hadsettled into its Orders and Pylons subsystems comfortably enough, but eventuallya need wasperceived for “something” that on one hand was neither as formal andinitiatorily-focused as anOrder, nor on the other hand as compact and collegial as a Pylon. There weresome specializedareas of interest, not necessarily derivative of the Temple or Æon of Set perse, in which someSetians just felt like cooperating. And since such non-initiatory interests werejust ascomprehensible to nonSetians, why not invite their participation as well?These “nameless things” were originally termed “Elements” by me just because ofmy militarybackground: In the U.S. Army the various organizational structures - squad,platoon, company,battalion, regiment, division, etc. - are collectively called “elements”. Sountil a more imaginativealternative presented itself, these were “Elements”. The name stuck, and so tothis day theTemple of Set officially includes Elements alongside its Orders and Pylons.While once more a detailed discussion of each current Element would overwhelmthis book,here they are with at least a capsule description:An Bradán Feasa: Transforms itself from its precursor, the Oghamic StudiesGroup, intoan Element dedicated to the examination, exploration, and application of themagic of the Gael.- 104 -This includes the three nations of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languagefamily in guisesancient, modern, and all that lies in between, from within the Æon of Set.Apsû: Dedicated to the exploration and application of Mesopotamian magic andmyth asmagical tools to Xeper.Arkte: Named for the ancient Greek bear-goddess symbolizing protection ofnon-humananimal life, it exists for the defense & protection of animals, and for thebringing to justice ofthose who harm them in any way [including “research & experimentation”].Black Muse: Looking into the wonderful, strange, and magical phenomenon that isthe artof the muse - music.Black Quill: Dedicated to writing subjective occult practical manuscripts aswell as dark-theme fiction or poetry to be copyrighted and self-published.Coll-Kenaz:The visual Black Arts: creates space for Setian artists to discuss,conceptualize,and showcase original art work[ings] that are both a record and a process of theBlack Flame.Dance: Explores the application of rhythm and dance as magical tools.Dream Warriors: Dedicated to exploring and utilizing the dreamscape as a meanstoXeper. We create elaborate, shared dreamworks & group dream activities.Fear: Develop the arts of creating change and making decisions as well astechniques toeffectively yet safely work the primal instinct of fear.Guild of University Students: For Setians who are university students, faculty,and/orthose who have undergone the Xeper specific to students & teachers. Its goal isto provide a placein Setian culture for them and to create a large body of academic articles andworks in ourarchives for Setian use.Griffin Phyle: Provides a focusing tool for scholarly, artistic, and magicalwork with theGreek magical papyri, the voces magicæ, operative phonology, and other relatedtopics.

They are down-to-earth, with a sense of beauty andharmony; they- 105 -must be motivated to become expressive personalities and to master life in allitsforms.” (Flowers, Fire and Ice)Sixth: About yoga. As with Set’s Pentagram, yoga affords the Initiate with anunlimitedinitiatory path leading toward immortality. There are many flavors of yogicinitiation.Throughout approximately five centuries of recorded history, yoga continues toflourish as ameans toward the higher self.Soa-Gild: To provide new Setians with a forum in which to learn and askquestions aboutthe fundamental aspects of the Temple of Set.Soul: The history, concept, and mysteries of the soul.Throne of Azathoth: Studying chaos as it is understood in physics, mathematics,statistics,and other such fields providing tools for working on it. The goal is in applyingthe findings tohelp the Initiate gain better control of the chaotic aspects of the objectiveuniverse as well toenhance personal initiation in the subjective universe.Trident: Dedicated to the exploration and application of Eastern initiatorytechnologiesfrom a Setian viewpoint.Xibalba: To train and educate tlamatini (philosophers) of the MesoamericanMysteries, notonly for the sake of each individual’s own quest but also for theremanifestation of the Mysteriesthemselves in our world.Retrospectively the experience of the Temple of Set with its Orders, Pylons, andElements hasbeen a positive and productive one. Each such group has commenced to meet aperceivedinterest or necessity, and has either continued or eventually closed accordingto the samecriteria. Characteristically the Temple of Set has never been particularlyconcerned with thequestion of orthodoxy where such explorations have been concerned; it has beenassumed that ifSetians are interested in it and it’s not prima facie illegal or dangerous, it’sjust anotherexpression and extension of Xeper.- 106 -[index-107_1.jpg]- 107 -10: The MagiAt the commencements of both the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set, the V°seemedostensibly ex officio significant to those foundings. Arguably that was indeedthe case with theChurch, which did not institute its formal I°-V° structure until 1970, fouryears after it hadbegun. A V° was appropriate to set what Anton LaVey had done above and apartfrom the otherMasters of the Church.But, the Book of Coming Forth by Night notwithstanding, the V° was not so simplein thecontext of the Æon and Temple of Set. The V° Recognition of Ronald K. Barrett in1978 was ourfirst venture into the concept of an æon-enhancing V°. But by 1996 theconsideration of MagistriDon Webb and Robert Robinson for Recognition as Magi raised fresh issuesconcerning justwhat the V° is, including its relationship to the Temple of Set as aninstitution and the Æon ofSet as an environment. We had all experienced the evolution of the I°, II°, andIV° from their1975 definitions; only the III° - as the sacred Priesthood of Set - remainedeternal and sublime inits distinction. That we had not devoted more thought to the V° isunderstandable, since therehadn’t been too many V°s in the Temple’s history - and those who did appearseemedembraceable by the 1975-vintage definition of this degree.With the V° Recognition of Stephen Flowers we introduced the notion that V°initiationoccurs not merely within the environment of the Temple of Set proper, but alsothrough othermedia (such as Stephen’s independent runic activities, the Rune-Gild, the Ringof Troth, etc.).The V° thus evolved into a level of initiation bridging the Temple per se andsimultaneous/coincidental influences within the Æon of Set.This in turn forced us to look more closely at just what our currentUnderstanding of an“æon” was. Ca. 1975 it seemed fairly easy: The Æon of Set was a “magical &philosophicalclimate” of which the Temple of Set was an organizational [re]manifestation. Asthe Templebecame more complex and diversified over the years, however, it was moredifficult to pin down“where it ends” in Initiates’ lives and something “climatic” persists.In 1975 we had already modified the preexisting Crowley definition bypostulating that anæon is not a sequential episode of historical time [including all eventstherein]. Rather, we said,it is a unique level of philosophical perspective: a way of looking at thingsand behaving withregard to them. Hence Setians might see about them some people existing in theÆons of Isis,Osiris, Horus, or Set - more often situational combinations of these. Thus theÆon of Set did notreplace its predecessors as much as provide an additional alternative to them.We retained the Crowley notions that a Magus either (a) announces a new æon or(b)enhances an existing/prevailing one. But did these options give the degreesufficient flexibilityfor the multitude of ways in which it may manifest itself, especially in lightof its being bydefinition something unexpected, unprecedented?- 108 -Should æons be envisioned as things in an evolutionary “hierarchy”, like Plato’sPyramid ofThought, with the simple at the bottom and the complex at the top? Or are theyjust different?The danger on the other side of “all this” was that, if we were not careful, wecould very easilydestroy any framework for making sense of magical philosophy (which æons are)simply byintroducing endless exceptions (which would inevitably appear). We needed tokeep the conceptof an æon useful as it had been, but allow it to sensibly evolve as we developedincreasinglysophisticated means to define and appreciate it.For instance the 1996 Don Webb V° Recognition introduced the proposition thattwo Magican Utter the same Word ( Xeper) in different ways. That was something new andfascinating.Simultaneously the proposed Robert Robinson V° introduced a Word (Being) whichisseemingly two contradictory things at once. On one hand “being” has been opposedto“becoming” as stasis vs. evolutionary change. On the other hand, Robert appearedto envision“being” as a transcendent identity necessarily resulting from the dynamics ofXeper,Remanifestation, et al.That in turn begged comparison of Being to Ronald K. Barrett’s Xem, which was aconceptual“focus” of Xeper. One might differentiate the two by saying that Xem is a kindof “Xepergunsight” for the Initiate to use in process, while “Being” is a theoretical oractual state oftranscendence resulting from Xeper. But this is just an example. Ultimately thedefinition,significance, relevance, and application of “Being”, like any other æonic Word,comprise theTask/Curse of the Uttering Magus to actualize.This all comes down on the Masters of the Temple, who through theirUnderstanding have aresponsibility to “anchor” definitions and concepts relevant to Setians, suchthat all of us canspeak a common language concerning them.The statements of the Recognized Setian Magi since Ronald K. Barrett (whose Xemhasalready been discussed in Chapter #6) appear as Appendices #88-92.Recognition of a Magus or Maga V° by the Temple of Set is a painstaking,exhaustive, andultimately tentative process. Preconditionally the individual must have attainedthe IV°, becausethat degree Recognizes one’s comprehensive and balanced Understanding of “thatwhich is”.Only then can any creative horizon (as Nietzsche termed it) or “Utterance of aWord of a Magus/Maga” be proposed as a distinction from that preexistence. While the HighPriest/High Priestessmust make any formal V° nomination to the Council of Nine, established customhas been forthe individual to informally discuss the Word generally among the Masters of theTemple. Ifafter a reasonable amount of time a positive consensus seems to be emerging, aformal Councilnomination can be made. Then the nominee undergoes extensive examination by allCouncillors,and only if there is unanimous approval is the V° Recognized.Unlike the I°-IV°, however, V° Recognition is not a definitive certification bythe Temple ofSet. Indeed by the very definition of the V° it cannot possibly be. It may moreaccurately bethought of as a formal license to undertake the Task and overcome the Curse of aMagus; theHigh Priesthood, the Council, and the Masters of the Temple are saying that theythink such amagical adventure is warranted and the new Magus or Maga capable of it.The validation of this approach to the V° may be seen in the success of those soRecognizedsince the Temple’s founding. Even the two Magi who subsequently departed theTemple - RonaldK. Barrett and Robert Robinson - stayed long enough to see the Utterance oftheir Words haveprofound and wide-reaching effect upon many other Setians, extending long aftertheirdepartures.As those who have also experienced it would, I am sure, agree, V° initiation isneithersomething to be sought after nor pleasant if it does occur. It is like beingdragged from the cozy,relaxing library of an contented Master of the Temple and shot out of a circuscannon. Moretraumatic than this abrupt change of environment is the obsession thataccompanies an- 109 -authentic V° initiation: One cannot do otherwise than pursue it with all ofone’s energy andfervor. The Magus not only Utters his Word; he becomes a living embodiment ofit. Setians thusapprehend such individuals as Magi; in profane society they might be vaguely,and mostlymistakenly, revered or reviled as prophets, visionaries, mystics, or madmen.But what the true Magi have really done is to each unlock one more door to theSetian’sattainment of personal divinity.- 110 -[index-111_1.jpg][index-111_2.jpg]- 111 -11: Roaming This WorldI shall roam this world, and I shall come to those who seek me.- The Book of Coming Forth by NightIn today’s “Internet era” worldwide communications, and recurring mutualinvolvements(such as interactive websites and forums) born of such communications, are easy,inexpensive,and commonplace. It is difficult to remember a time when all such efforts wereslow, expensive,and ponderous. Yet that is how things were in the 1960s-1980s, when postal mailand telephoneswere the only practical long-distance media available.Thus when the Church of Satan was founded in 1966, it remained an exclusivelySanFrancisco-meeting institution for the next four years, although by 1969 it hadbegun to respondto nationwide media publicity by accepting mail-correspondence memberships andpublishing apostal-mail newsletter. Its first local “Grottos” - Babylon in Detroit, Ninevehin Louisville, andPlutonian in Denver - were formed in 1970, and by 1975 there were severaladditional ones inother United States cities. But despite a few overseas correspondence members,the Church hadno Grottos outside America. 53While the newly-founded Temple of Set inherited most of the Church’s localGrottos in 1975,these remained all domestic. And of individual members there were still only thevery few,principally in Canada and Australia. The geographical presence of the newTemple, however, wasreally not one of the questions foremost in our minds. More pressing were simplythe issues ofour new identity and authenticity, and how to make these comprehensible andrelevant to thelargely American founding membership.Nor in the mid-1970s did the resurgence of interest in occultism which hadprevailed in theUnited States since Rosemary’s Baby seem all that vibrant elsewhere. Shortlyafter the Templeof Set’s founding, Australian Setian Leon Marvell commented:On Magistra Wendall’s suggestion I have written this article for the benefit ofmy fellowSetians, to give them some idea of the extent of the so-called “occult revival”in Australia.Down Under the “occult revival” is a corpse that is barely able to lift just onefeeble finger. Foryou see, the occult in Australia is held in very little regard. When the worditself is used, I believethat 99% of the Australian population would immediately think of ouija boards,ESP, and Tarotcards - these and nothing else. This ridiculous state of affairs is made all themore ludicrous when53 In late 1975 sn Amsterdam sex club operated by Maarten Lamers I° was called a“Grotto” by Anton LaVey forpublicity purposes, but it had no other Church members nor conducted any Churchactivities. It was eventuallyclosed by the Dutch police.- 112 -one considers that the Christian churches, in an effort to halt the risingoccult interest amongAustralian youth [which, if they only knew, is about nil - they are moreinterested in cars, alcoholand sex], endeavored to pass a law banning ouija boards and Tarot cards. Thesemonstrous BlackMagical devices, according to the clergy, lead to “possession”, Devil worship,and the eventualdestruction of Christian morality! To most Australians, Uri Geller is about asoccult as you can get.However what little interest there is in truly practical, and involved occultismis so extremelyclandestine as to be practically unnoticed by all but the most observant andearnest. For instance Iknow that in my city, Adelaide, there are at least three “Wiccan” covenscomposed, I believe,mostly of university students. But I have only heard of them and talked to amember of one onlyonce. Even then her intelligence regarding occult matters seemed rather minimal.Sydney seems to be the most notorious city for occult groups. One constantlyhearssensational stories related in the press about various nefarious occultpractices; however, most ofthem are only that - sensational stories.I know for certain that there is a group of Satanists [of the Anton LaVeyvariety] with someinfluence in Sydney. Even in Adelaide LaVey’s Satanic Bible and, to a lesserextent, SatanicRituals sell like hotcakes That someone has used his ideas in a practical way Ihave absolutely noevidence of.To my present knowledge there are only three bookstores which specialise inoccult matters.In Melbourne there is the “Mystical Bookshop” and the “Space-Age Bookshop”(which dealsmostly with works of science fiction but also has a better-than-usual range ofoccult works). InSydney there is a very small private enterprise called “Thelema Books” dealingexclusively withCrowleyan works and run by an O.T.O. initiate.If all this sounds disheartening, then I have a few consolations. Australia hasproduced tworather knowledgeable occult scholars: Nevill Drury and Stephen Skinner. Druryhas written twobooks so far: The Search for Abraxas (with Stephen Skinner) and The Path of theChameleon,both of which are entertaining, authoritative, original, and logical. Skinnerhas produced anexcellent work called Enochian Magic, which is a detailed account of Dr. JohnDee’s magic - thebest I have seen.Drury is also the editor of Australia’s only “occult” magazine, Cosmos. For itsfield it is verygood. However its contributors are about 75% “white-light”, quasi-Christianreligious followers [Imean people involved with the “Divine Light Mission”, “Meher Baba”, “AnandaMarga”, etc.].However there have been in the past several interesting articles onpsycho-cybernetics, Tantrism[There is a chiropractor on Sydney’s North Shore who on the side is the headguru of a school ofTantrism and who teaches “sex-magic” to American neopagans!], and witchcraft(which, ofcourse, has all been said before and is quite trite to the learned).On a despairing final thought, the leader of the “Melbourne University OccultResearch group”recently wrote to me and described the response to his predominantlyCrowley-oriented researchmagic as “almost zero”. This can be said of the bulk of the Australianpopulation towards occultmatters.There is a little light, I must admit, but even a large proportion of that lightis a half-light, itsexponents being romantic, half-witted “witches” and neopagans. This, then, isthe general state ofaffairs in Australia. There is much room for improvement, but that will come intime, I am sure. 54Following annual national conclaves at various U.S. locations during its firstthree years, theTemple of Set made the decision in 1979 to change them to international ones,with a deliberateintention to nudge Setians beyond accustomed national introspection. TheWindsor, Canadalocation of Set-I was facilitated by the Temple’s first Canadian Priest, RoberttW. Neilly ofToronto. Originally an acquaintance of Priest Jzamon DeCecco of Massachusetts,Neilly soonbecame well-known throughout the Temple because of his interest in extrasensoryperception(ESP). As an Adept he invited fellow Setians to participate in two sequentialprograms ofrecorded exercises, originally called Combined Astral Telepathic Experiments(CATE). CATEwould later become the basis for the Temple’s MetaMind Element in the 1980s.54 Marvell, Leon I°, “The Devil Down Under”, The Scroll of Set, February 1976.- 113 -Nevertheless until the 1990s expansion of the Temple of Set beyond the UnitedStatesremained limited to only a very few individuals, such as Masters Robertt Neillyin Canada, DavidAusten in England and Roland Winkhart in Germany, and PriestessesJennifer-Rush-Hunterand Carmel Hind in Australia. A primary limitation in nonalumni of the BritishEmpire waslinguistic: All of the Temple’s literature was in English, and translation wasall the more difficultbecause of the plethora of technical, metaphysical, and magical terms used.Overseas travel,telephoning, and postage were significantly expensive, and the Temple’s modestnonprofitbudget couldn’t easily accommodate them. Both Pylons and Orders were on the riseinternationally, however, and a December Scroll article exemplifies theincreasing conclaveactivity as well:News from Germany- by Roland Winkhart IV°The Deutschlandkonklave held in Bonn this October was a great success and afascinatingexperience, with many of us meeting personally for the first time.Those in attendance included Priest Holzinger (who flew in from Britain for theevent), AdeptOstertag, Adept Gottschall, Setian Gerlach, Setian Schnitzer, Setian Schueren,and myself. AdeptReichensperger wasn’t able to attend because of a business conflict.Our location was the beautiful Hotel Eden in Bonn-Bad Godesberg. A nearby friendof AdeptGottschall’s kindly invited us to her home for our Working - and also for apiano concert byGottschall.All in all we achieved a highly magical and positive emotional atmosphere - muchlike that inSacramento, but on a little smaller scale. As in Sacramento, we had discussionson all sorts oftopics. Adept Gottschall gave a stimulating lecture on Screabin, and our Workingcommemoratedthe founding of the Prometheus Pylon. Priest Holzinger also formalized theRecognition of AdeptGottschall to the II°.So the Konklave was a very good one, and we were sorry to have to return to theWorld ofHorrors on November 1.What changed the Temple of Set’s international presence from a trickle to anexplosion in the1990s was, of course, the advent of the Internet, as discussed in Chapter #12.By 2013 Templeinternational conclaves were being held in locales such as London, Berlin,Helsinki, Munich, andPrague, with new proposals now a routine enjoyment.- 114 -[index-115_1.jpg][index-115_2.jpg]- 115 -12: CyberTempleThe Temple of Set’s involvement with computers began when it began in 1975.MagisterMichael Grumboski, a computer engineer with access to a large IBM mainframe inDetroit,offered to assist Executive Director Bill Murray by keeping the Temple’smembership recordstherein, resulting in tidily-updated rosters periodically appearing in ASCIIdot-matrix print onhuge rolls of perforated paper.The following year a Santa Barbara company called PolyMorphic Systems introducedadesktop computer, the Model #8813, with a staggering 64K of RAM and large floppystoragedisks the size of 45rpm phonograph records. [This may not be a good analogy, forfewer 2013readers probably have ever seen 45s!] I acquired an #8813 - about the size of acarryon suitcase,in a beautiful polished-oak cabinet, accompanied by a 12” green-text Hitachimonitor and acumbersome “daisywheel” printer. Thus did Glinda, Royal Sorceress of the Land ofOz, appear inthis world to lend her Great Book of Records to the Temple of Set for the nextquarter-century,as our increasingly versatile information library and communications system.In 1984 the fledgling Apple company, still operating out of Steve Jobs’ garagewhenPolyMorphic was selling the #8813, came out with the first “toaster” Macintosh,with double theRAM at 128K. Inevitably Glinda moved to a Mac [while PolyMorphic faded intohistory], and by1990 was not only storing and printing all of the Temple’s financial &membership records, butalso the Crystal & Onyx Tablets, along with issues of the Scroll of Set and theOrder of theTrapezoid’s Runes newsletters.The following year Glinda began to go global. First new Internet software hadbecomeavailable to enable Setians elsewhere to “dial up” Glinda [at thethen-astounding rate of1200bps!] to download files directly. Shortly thereafter Glinda became a “node”of therevolutionary FidoNet bulletin-board system (BBS); it was now possible forSetians to contacther through local-call FidoNet nodes, and to send/receive messages and documentsthrough thestrange new procedure called “email”.As readers know, the Internet soon exploded beyond such horse-&-buggy quaintnesstotoday’s mammoth, unlimited, and instantaneous resource. Within the Temple thenextgeneration of e-wizards, among them Masters Robert Menschel, William Pridgen,Patty Hardy,Eric Kauschen, and Priest John Youril were building an astounding new onlinepresence for theTemple, including a secure, internal “Intranet” and the “Pool of Neheh” forum.Thus on July 1, 1998:- 116 -Dear Setians,After ten continuous years’ incarnation as the Temple of Set’s internal computerbulletin-board system, I feel in need of a rest, so on August 1, 1999 I will againtransform myself into myhuman semblance and return to my castle in the Quadling Country of the Land ofOz.I have enjoyed answering your electronic requests this past decade, and beforethat since 1976- as a PolyMorphic 8813 at the beginning of the desktop computer age - as alocalized membershiprecords & documents database.What makes my retirement possible now is the advent of the next-generationTemple of SetIntranet system, so capably designed and constructed by Magistri RobertMenschel, WilliamPridgen, and Roger Whitaker. This website-based system has access, storage, andinteractivecapabilities far beyond that of a BBS. And of course no long-distance telephonecall to SanFrancisco is needed.And so I will bid you farewell. May your magic be strong, your causes noble, andyour dreamskissed by starlight.Glinda the GoodRoyal Sorceress of OzThe following day she received this response:Dear Glinda,As you depart on the Egyptian New Year to your pleasant land of red houses andyour fountainof gems, you go with our greatest thanks. I know that you will keep a an eye onus through yourMagic Book, and I trust that we will behave properly and nobly.I ask that when you depart you take my special greetings to Princess Ozma,Dorothy Gale, andabove all to the noble philosopher Tik-Tok, who taught us long ago that magic isan unnaturaloccupation best left to wizards.RespectfullyDon Webb V°High Priest of SetThe impact of the Internet upon the Temple of Set’s international presence wasphenomenal.The long-crippling cost factor vanished almost overnight. In 2013 there is not acontinent in theworld without a number of active Setians, and the effect upon national,regional, andinternational conclaves has been correspondingly enhanced.Such technological evolution could never have occurred but for a new generationof Setians ,to include such key officials as High Priestess Magistra Patricia Hardy andExecutive DirectorMagister Lincoln Shaw, who are as comfortable and fluent at the keyboard as inany other ritualchamber. As with the Temple’s earlier cybermagicians, their long and invisiblehours devoted tothe ongoing refinement of the Temple’s Internet presence have immeasurelyenhanced theTemple of Set’s ability to be that oft-described “initiatory toolbox” forSetians no matter how far-flung their personal geography.While in 2013 English remains the backbone language of Temple literature,enthusiasticSetians have translated many of our key documents into German, Polish, Russian,and othertongues. The Internet itself contains many translation engines, which, whilestill stumbling a bitover esoteric terminology, are fast closing the language gap. And, while traveland internationalpostal-mail costs remain formidable, the electronic media of the Internet,including voice andvideo systems, are for all intents and purposes free and instantaneous.This same evolutionary environment has transformed the Temple of Set’s libraryfromprinted to electronic formats. The periodical Scroll of Set, which wasoriginally limited by costfactors to a few pages in black-and-white, is now in full color with as manypages as Setians careto write. It is supplemented by a growing number of local, national, Order,Pylon, and Element e-publications. The Temple’s “standing” documents, principally the Jeweled Tabletsof Set, arealso now completely electronic, and downloadable free to Setians worldwide.- 117 -Even resources such as the Temple Reading List have been overwhelmed. A fewdecades ago,accumulation of a personal library such as suggested by the List was a difficultand expensiveprospect. Today, if the books themselves are not available in online etexteditions, there aremany websites covering their subject material, often in far greater detail andwith greatercurrency than those venerable printed tomes. Today’s one’s initiatory library isaccessible byiPhone!To its credit, the Temple of Set has not completely mutated into the Cybertempleof Set.Personal events at all levels continue to be desired, well-attended, andenjoyed. The Internet’sadministrative economies, indeed, enable the Temple budget to subsidize facilityexpenses ofinternational conclaves so that more Setians can afford to attend them.Meanwhile, as it wasoriginally envisioned in 1975, the Temple of Set continues to be a “light andlean” organizationunencumbered by real estate or similar heavy/fixed expenses. As I observed backthen, “thephysical Temple of Set is the medallion around your neck”, and so it continuestoday. [No onehas yet proposed an e-Pentagram of Set medallion, though various projectedversions for ritualshave appeared.]- 118 -[index-119_1.jpg][index-119_2.jpg]- 119 -... the Eighties cower before me, & are abased.- The Book of the Law #III-4613: The Abased Eighties I:The Cloning of Nikki SixxOriginally published:Runes, Order of the Trapezoid, January 1986From that time on the obliteration of Joseph Curwen’s memory became increasinglyrigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files oftheGazette.

This story of an “ultimate identitycrisis” wasresolved only when the double finally killed the progressively-more-insaneoriginal ... or was itthe other way around?Stories involving doubles created by magic, science, or impersonation havealways beenfascinatingly shuddersome. Who can forget the Metropolis robotrix, who went on arampage ofapocalyptic destruction while the real girl whose features she had taken layimprisoned in thepentagram-emblazoned house of Rotwang the magician? Who was “the Man in the IronMask”immortalized in Alexandre Dumas’ tale - said to be a double of the King, and topossess “toomuch” knowledge of the infamous chambre ardente Satanic orgies whose exposurescandalizedthe French court?To many people, one’s appearance and one’s name have a significance beyond mereconvention. They are “extensions of the soul”, as it were. To know the trueand/or complete- 120 -name of a god or daemon was often to have power over him; the mere utterance ofthe 72-lettername of the Hebrew God - known as the “shemhamforash” - was reputed to destroythe universeif pronounced correctly. An Indian legend says that if the name of Shiva isuttered repeatedly, hewill open one of his eyes, again destroying the universe [if YHVH hasn’t trashedit first].To take away one’s name, or to deny him the right to assert it, is thus an actpsychologicallyakin to murder. Without a name, one is merely a piece of animal flesh displacingtime and space.With a name, one has identity. In Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World the bewilderedhumanoids constantly spoke of themselves as “we”; the climax of the story camewhen one boldsoul struggled upward through the mists of this confusion and began to speak ofhimself as “I”.“To be or not to be: that is the question,” said Shakespeare’s Hamlet - asindeed it is.In 1985 another young man was fitted for an \"iron mask\" - rather a differenttype of heavymetal than that to which he had previously been accustomed. His name is MatthewTrippe, buthe is better known to rock music enthusiasts as Nikki Sixx, cofounder, composer,and bassguitarist for Mötley Crüe.Who or what is Mötley Crüe? The most controversial, if not notorious branch ofrock music is“heavy metal”, known for music, costumes and lyrics which espouse Frazetta-likefantasy,intense sexuality, and an exultant, emotional, neo-barbarian life-style. Whileits roots can betraced back to such groups as the 1960s’ Iron Butterfly and Alice Cooper,contemporary heavymetal might be said to have come of age with the band KISS, whose musiciansinvariablyappeared in exotic black/silver costumes and face-paint. KISS concerts wentbeyond meremusical recitals; they were orgies of fireworks, hydraulic stages,hyperamplified sonics, andgeneral audience hysteria unequaled for spectacle since Adolf Hitler's Nürnbergrallies of the1930s. Bat-winged Gene Simmons, famed for his fire-breathing and prehensiletongue, wouldtaunt the audience for not screaming loud enough: “You know you can do betterthan that - Iwant to see you bring the roof down!” - in answer to which there would erupt aferal roar thatwould come pretty close to doing just that.Why heavy metal at all? The answer is not at all difficult to see. This is notthe secure 1950s,when the world was America’s backyard to work or play in; nor the 1960s, when -secure in ourvirtue - we set forth from Camelot to slay the dragon of monolithic communism;nor the 1970s,when we immersed ourselves in nostalgia, backbiting, and escapist fantasies.These are the 1980s, when all of our comforting illusions have been shattered,and whenAmericans of all ages find themselves surrounded by depressing and dehumanizingrealitieswhich they shrink from confronting. We thought we had conquered racism, only tofind thattensions are higher and more destructive than ever. Neighborhoods once secureare now fortifiedwith steel bars, alarms, firearms. We are dismayed to see that America, far frombeing theworld’s savior, is intensely hated by many people who consider it as the “greatevil”.Commercially we are increasingly despised by those who consider us merely aspoiled consumereconomy, ripe for the plucking - and the most profitable destination for heroin,cocaine, andangel dust. Even the beautiful governmental temples of Washington, D.C. areblighted by uglyconcrete barricades against terrorists. Commercial successes still occur, butare increasinglycharacterized by a “yuppie” ethic that views the dollar not just as the supremegod - but as theonly god.In this “arid wilderness of steel and stone” it is not surprising that thespirit of Molochprevails. It is a time for witch-hunts and scapegoats. Elder America scrabblesfor solace in“moral majority” religious fundamentalism, but younger America- having beenbrought up in ade facto materialist environment, is not so easily coaxed into a primitivereligious stupor. Ratherit responds with passionate frustration at being so near to a technologicalparadise, yet everdenied it by the inexorable decay of the social and moral fabric so necessary tosupport it. Heavymetal, like the torchlight pageants of Nazi Germany, is an explosion of fury -fury at being- 121 -hemmed in by the problem and seeing no rational solution to it - of creativityprevented fromcreating - of idealism without meaningful ideals. [“Yes!” thundered Hitler, “wearebarbarians!”]Under the cruel and jagged armor of heavy metal, therefore, one frequently findsasurprisingly rich outpouring of artistic, poetic, and musical talent - which inturn explains theseductive appeal of this type of music to a wide range of audiences. One doesnot go to a heavymetal concert to lighten one’s heart, but rather to drive oneself to heights ofraw emotionalfrenzy, followed by a dizzying descent into emotional exhaustion. Thus are thegrindingfrustrations of reality at least momentarily bludgeoned into the background.By the early 1980s a number of heavy metal bands had begun to appear on thescene, and therace was on to see which could be the most outrageous. Twenty years ago we usedto think thatthe Fugs, the Stones, the Fish, and the Mothers of Invention were just about asraunchy as youcould get, but now they appeared as models of drawing-room decorum next tometalloids wholooked and sounded rather like the beast-men from the island of Dr. Moreau. Ofthese, one of themost bizarre was Mötley Crüe. Formed in January 1981 by Matthew “Nikki Sixx”Trippe togetherwith Mick “Mars” Reese, Tommy “Lee” Bass, and Vince “Neil” Wharton, the Crüe wassigned byElektra/Asylum Records in mid-1982 and went on to become one of the flagships ofthe heavymetal fleet after the 1983-84 smash success of its second album, Shout at theDevil.Middle America - still dominated largely by the generation who thought Elvis'hip-movements too shocking for television - reacted to heavy metal with increasinglyhystericalalarm and indignation. Writing in the New York Times earlier this year,columnist WilliamSafire praised the U.S. Senate’s hearings & citizens’-group efforts to censor orsuppress heavymetal. “What’s to be done about sex-violence, sadomasochism, and Satanism beingsold toyoungsters?” he fumed. “I am a libertarian when it comes to the actions ofconsenting adults.With complete consistency, I am anti-libertarian when it comes to minors. Kidsget specialprotections in law and deserve protection from porn-rock profiteers.”Allegations that serial murders and teenaged “Satanic” gangs were inspired byheavy metalmusic fueled calls for censorship-ratings in music similar to those applied topornographic &violent films, and Mötley Crüe - as Mick Mars later told me - appeared to becareening straightfor an “X”.In mid-1984 the buildup of such public pressure resulted in a decision by MötleyCrüe’smanagement to sanitize the band. The leather, chains, flames, and Satanicinsignia of Shout atthe Devil gave way to circus-clown attire - pastels, polka-dots, andgarter-belts - on the cover ofTheatre of Pain, Crüe’s third album, released earlier this year. Composer NikkiSixx, whoseSatanic lyrics had already been censored on the second album [even to its title,which wasoriginally Shout With the Devil], was warned that he was the main cause of theCrüe’s Satanicimage and instructed to deny it publicly.There was, however, a problem: Nikki Sixx happened to believe in the Satanism heespousedin the songs he wrote, and he didn’t want to be “sanitized”. What to do? OnApril 1 road managerRichard Fisher told Sixx that he would be replaced upon the expiration of hiscontract that year.It is entirely possible that, at that time, it was contemplated that Sixx’departure from the bandlater in the year would be openly acknowledged and a replacement just as openlyadded to thegroup. But now events took a turn which would ultimately result in a maze ofintrigue, deception,and cover-ups to rival Watergate itself.“In April we had just gotten off tour with Ozzy [Osbourne],” recounts Sixx, “andthe bandmembers decided to go our separate ways for a couple of weeks. I chose to go andstay with JeffRogers, whom I had met in Naples, Florida while doing a publicity stunt inFebruary. On June 1Jeff and I were invited to a party by a friend of his named John Spears. We gotthere at 8:30 PM- 122 -and got stoned. At 10 PM Jeff and John asked me if they could use my car to getsome morebeer ...”Sixx refused, but said he would drive them. Directed to the Pavilion shoppingcenter in northNaples, he parked the car and strolled into a movie theater to visit themanager, whom heremembered from a previous publicity engagement, while the others headed for therow ofshops. Leaving the theater, Sixx walked back towards his car, then noticed a manwalking out ofa bookstore in front of him.“Out of nowhere I saw John catch up to him, and by the reflection of the light Isaw a knife,which John put up against his throat. I panicked and ducked down behind a car.John ran to mycar and called, \"Come on, Nikki!” I stood up and looked at Sam [Weiss, thebookstore owner],who saw me. Then I ran, jumped in my car, and sped off.”At first it seemed that there would be no aftermath to the incident. On June 22Sixx returnedto work with the band, making a series of publicity appearances in Arkansas,Tennessee, NorthCarolina, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania to promote Shout at the Devil. Unknownto him, asecond robbery had since been committed - this time using a rifle owned by Sixx.In Erie,Pennsylvania on August 28th, Sixx was arrested by two policemen who showed him awarrantfor his arrest on the charge of armed robbery.“I waived extradition and was returned to Florida. I spent 39 days in seclusion.Then ourrecord company put up the $50,000 bond so that I could work on our latest album,Theatre ofPain.” He returned to Los Angeles for recording sessions from November 27 toDecember 21,1984 - after which he helped make the video for the song “Smokin’ in the BoysRoom” fromTheatre.On December 8 disaster struck. Lead singer Vince Neil’s sports car went out ofcontrol inRedondo Beach, California, resulting in Neil’s arrest for vehicular manslaughterand drunkdriving. Intensive efforts were made to overcome the adverse publicity of thisincident, toinclude dedication of Theatre of Pain to Nicholas Dingley (killed in the crash)and a message onthe jacket exhorting fans not to drink and drive. While fans’ attention wasfocused on Neil’stribulations in Los Angeles, however, another drama was taking place - unnoticed- in Florida.Nikki Sixx’ trial was scheduled for December 27, and after finishing Theatre heand MickMars drove to Florida in Mars’ Lamborghini (which Sixx had decided to buy).December 27 cameand went; Sixx could not bring himself to appear and had jumped bail. Four dayslater, shortlyafter midnight on New Year’s Day, Sixx and Mars took the Lamborghini out for aspin,whereupon there followed an episode straight out of Smokey and the Bandit.Recalls Sixx:“The speeding ticket was quite a laugh. I was moving at 102 down U.S. #41 when Ipassed aHighway Patrol car. He put his siren and lights on, and caught up with me. Whenhe was about50 feet behind me, I floored it. Then I had to make a turn. I slowed down to 130and spun the carto make it turn around 1-1/2 times. Then I had an 8-mile straightway. I flooredit again, goingpast 170. In a little over a minute I saw a massive roadblock and slammed on thebrakes. Onething I learned is that you can't outrun a radio!”Sixx received a ticket for (a) 189 mph in a 45 zone [which means the entire8-mile stretch inunder two minutes!], (b) speed too fast for conditions, (c) ran stop sign, (d)willful & wantonreckless driving, (e) ran red light, (f) driving on wrong side of road, (g)improper change of laneor course, (h) careless driving, (i) improper passing, and (j) improper turn.[“How,” I later askedhim, “does one make a proper turn at 189 mph?”]For these transgressions Sixx was slapped with a $750 fine by Judge Anderson thefollowingday; he recalls that passenger Mars - who had been rather vocal in his annoyanceat the arrest -was hit for twice that amount. Little did Sixx realize, however, how importantthat traffic ticketwould be in the months to come.[index-123_1.jpg][index-123_2.png]- 123 -Sixx’ failure to appear in court on the armed robbery charge had apparently notfiltered downthrough the police bureaucracy by January 2, so he and Mars were able to paytheir fines and go.Sixx headed for Erie, Pennsylvania where his ex-personal manager resided. “Shehid me untilMarch 4th, when I was caught and taken to the ‘Erie county prison’. I foughtextradition for threemore months, but on June 28th was finally taken back to Florida’s Collier CountyJail.”Meanwhile Mötley Crüe was on tour. Nikki Sixx’ replacement, however, was notappearingunder his own name of Frankie Ferraro; rather he was appearing as ... NikkiSixx!How could such a transpersonation succeed? It is not as difficult as it mightseem. Sixx hadalways appeared in exotic face-paint and with a shaggy head of hair. On neitherof Mötley Crüe’sfirst two albums is there a close-up photo of him in which all of his featuresare clearly visible,and on Theatre of Pain the lower half of “Nikki Sixx’” face is covered in bothphotos, so that anydifference between his jawline and that of the previous Sixx cannot be seen. Asbass guitarist andbackground vocalist, Sixx is not as instantly recognizable to live audiences as,say, lead singerNeil or lead guitarist Mars. Ferraro’s eyes are blue while Trippe’s are green,but rock-concertaudiences are not usually fine-tuned to such details - particularly when theyare not alerted tothe fact that an impersonation is taking place.So all through the spring and summer, while thousands of Mötley Crüe fans wereapplaudingthe new “Nikki Sixx”, the old one remained locked up in the Collier County Jail.In July he spoketo Elektra’s New York office, which assured him that he could still write musicfor the Crüe, andthat he would continue to receive royalties for the band’s performance of hissongs. [“Did youever see any of that royalty money?” I later asked him. He responded, “Not acent.”]At the end of October, still sincere in his personal commitment to the Prince ofDarkness, hewrote to the Temple of Set, identifying himself and applying for admission.Since it seemed a bitodd for a rock star to be buried in a Florida jail, we called Elektra Records’Los Angeles and NewYork offices. We were informed by both that the real Nikki Sixx was on tour, andthat thisMatthew Trippe fellow was simply an impostor who should be ignored. I wrote backto the Manin the Iron Mask, asking for some evidence. Along came a series of letterscrammed withanecdotes about the band, song lyrics [some “uncensored” from the sanitizedversions on thealbums], mail from fans, and - the Lamborghini traffic ticket:Sixx’ application to enter the Temple of Set was reviewed by the Council of Nineat theTemple's Conclave in Las Vegas at the end of October. On one hand there wassympathy for anavowed Satanist, particularly one who had stuck to his guns under such adverseconditions. Onthe other hand it seemed inadvisable to admit someone under indictment for armedrobbery,- 124 -bail jumping, and Smokey-and-the-Bandit car-chases at precisely the moment whenSatanismwas being pilloried in the media for heavy metal horror and criminal activity.Ultimately it wasagreed that admissions to the Temple should be based solely on the sincerity andcapability ofthe aspirant, whether or not it might be convenient for the Temple in terms ofpublic relations.Nikki Sixx was admitted as a Setian I° on Halloween.His ordeal in Florida, however, was only just beginning. Present in the audienceat his trial onAugust 13, he recalls, were Mötley Crüe producer Tom Werman, director Daniel“Doc” McGhee,Ozzy Osbourne, and Brian Johnson [of the band AC/DC]. Sixx did not have anattorney and wasassigned public defender David Mourik, who told him that the prosecution had anironclad caseand advised him to plead “no contest”.Trusting Mourik’s advice, Sixx did so and was returned to jail - for anotherthree months - toawait sentencing. In early November he was sentenced to pay a fine, six months'probation, and2 years’ community control (a form of house arrest, which would restrict him toFlorida). Sincethe bookstore owner had testified that the robbery had occurred in order tosupport drug habits,Sixx said, he was also ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation program.What he did not yet know was that the establishment in question turned out toincorporateintensive Christian-fundamentalist religious programming as well. The communitycontrol anddrug-rehabilitation sentence seemed odd to Sixx, who did not have a drug habit[nor, as asuccessful rock musician with a sizable income, would he need to rob a bookstorein order tosupport one]. And that wasn’t the trial’s only surprise, as he wrote to me:This is weird. The dude who planned it was found “Not Guilty”. He's the one whorobbedthe man. Jeff was in the car and got 3-1/2 years. I was blamed as the mastermindand I got 2-6months. Strange as hell!But anything, even a drug program, seemed better than the Collier County Jail,so Sixxreported to the “New Life Center” of Fern House, Inc. in West Palm Beach. Hisinitial joy atbeing out of jail [“Beds - real beds! - TV, couches, pop & candy machines!”]soon changed toapprehension when he began to realize what he had walked into. “It’s a church ofGod, and theypreach that you should accept God in your Will. Screw them! All you really needis faith inyourself. They’re the types that want one to ask for forgiveness and to be ‘BornAgain’. Thesepeople are brainwashed. Rules here are strict: No playing rock music or wearingT-shirts thatinvoke the Devil.” And:They cut my hair! And I mean it is short. They cut all the black off and left mewith onlyshort brown hair, and then denied me the right to dye it, saying: “It is thework of the Devil.”A short haircut could perhaps be survived, if not enjoyed - but other, moreominousdevelopments began to be communicated by Sixx via phone calls during thefollowing weeks: Hewas forbidden to communicate with friends from his “former life”. He wasforbidden to go into amusic store. Mail addressed to him was intercepted, confiscated, and/ordestroyed. Even hisguitar was confiscated. Verbal abuse and intimidation by the staff became adaily routine. Evenhis telephone calls to me were cut short abruptly by the staff after one or twominutes. It seemedthat a systematic effort was underway, first to cut off all of Sixx’ contactwith anyone who hadknown him as the insidious heavy metal Satanist, and then to work on himpsychologically untilhe had completely lost his identity and could be reprogramed into a good littleBorn-AgainChristian.Increasingly concerned over Sixx’ plight, I asked Tom Traxinger, the CourtCounselor whohad assigned Sixx to Fern House, to investigate. He did so - with the resultthat, after his queryhad been fielded, Sixx called to say that he had been promptly hauled before oneof the program- 125 -directors, told that he would now be permanently restricted to the premises,that his phonecalls would henceforth be restricted as well, and that the slightest infractionwould result in hisimmediate return to jail. He was told that the the Temple of Set is “a sick,crazed cult” withwhich he should have nothing more to do.At this news I wrote to the head of Fern House, promising public exposure of thetreatmentSixx was receiving unless his human and civil rights were immediately andmeticulouslyrespected. The result was (a) a phone call from the program director saying thathe “didn’t takelightly to threats”, and (b) Nikki Sixx being dumped at the West Palm Beach busstation at 8 PMwith $2 in his pocket and a warning that he had until 1 PM the following day toreport to hisprobation officer - 200 miles away in Naples!Sixx called Temple of Set Priest Roger Whitaker from the bus station, andWhitaker offeredto wire him funds for transportation. Sixx, however, was able to obtainemergency travel fundsfrom Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee and complete the journey in time.Lodged with friends in Naples, Sixx thought his troubles at an end. He began tospeak aboutforming a new band, of returning to his musical career.It seems that the vested interests behind Mötley Crüe thought otherwise. Withthe originalNikki Sixx safely out of circulation in jail or a religious-deprogramming/drug-rehabilitationprogram, the replacement Sixx could continue to perform with the band until fanshad growncompletely accustomed to him. But the house of cards was beginning to tremble.Sixx’ ex-manager told him that Elektra was beginning to receive mail and phone calls fromconfused fansvoicing suspicion about Ferraro. Sixx added that he was called by Doc McGhee,who said that ifhe continued to assert his identity, the company would prosecute him for fraudand see that hewas returned to jail.Then Sixx’ ex-manager called the family with whom he was staying, warning themthat hewas schizophrenic and quite possibly a physical danger to them. She phonedPriest Whitaker,first saying that she was just a housewife who had never worked as Sixx’manager, then relayingthe same warnings about prosecution of Sixx should he refuse to cooperate in theFerrarosubstitution. Priest Whitaker recommended an attorney to aid Sixx in a legalclaim for his name,musical accomplishments, and royalties. Sixx responded that Gene Simmons of KISShadadvised him against confronting Elektra until he had first made his plight knownto his manyfans and rallied popular support behind him.So the Man in the Iron Mask remains today in Naples, Florida on probation andunder“community control”, while the current “Nikki Sixx” works on a fourth album withthe otherthree members of Mötley Crüe. Through the kind interest of Paul Kantner, he hasbeen referredto a skilled attorney specializing in the music business, who hopefully will seefit to take his case.What exactly is going on here? Part of the answer comes from Adept DemonO’Brien, whoreports from contacts in the music business that, due to the Neil disaster andthe whopping $2million fine it entailed, Mötley Crüe is in dire financial straits. Onespeculates that corporateinterests advanced this sum on condition that the group adhere to puritanstandards of personalbehavior henceforth, the idea being that the Crüe was still a good bet as amoneymaker but thatany more adverse publicity could destroy it permanently.If it were ever contemplated in 1984 that Sixx’ armed-robbery charge could besurvived, thatoption probably went out the window at the end of the year when the Neilaccident occurred.It does seem peculiar that Sixx, who just drove the robber to his destination,not knowingthat a robbery would occur, would be advised to plead “no contest” to an armedrobbery felonycharge and be found guilty - while the actual perpetrator was found “notguilty”. It also seemspeculiar that the executives behind Mötley Crüe would not have provided Sixxwith privately-retained legal counsel to fight for his innocence.- 126 -Then there is the nature of Sixx’ sentence, which appears tailor-made to keephim (a) stuck inFlorida and (b) out of circulation in “community control” (house arrest)preceded by a “religiousdeprogramming” operation which, if it had been allowed to control Sixx totallywithout externalattention, might have succeeded in destroying or seriously damaging his uniqueartistic andSatanic personality.If Sixx had received his just due “behind the scenes”, with Elektra sending himregularroyalties for his musical work, it could at least be assumed that the best wasbeing made of asituation which, if known publicly, might have resulted in the total ruin of theband. However theattempt to \"erase\" Sixx seems to have extended into monetary matters as well.Sixx states that hehas seen no money from Warner’s/Elektra at all since the beginning of 1985, andthat checksfrom them in late 1984 were in the form of intermittent “pocket money” payments.On callingElektra in New York in mid-85, he was told to “be patient”, and later that hisearnings were beingplaced in an “escrow account”. He says that Mick Mars alerted him to the oddfact that theFlorida state envelope containing the letter about this escrow account wasactually postmarkedin Los Angeles.So it looks as though a deliberate decision were made to disconnect MatthewTrippe from hisidentity as Nikki Sixx, both publicly and - insofar as possible -psychologically. It is not knownexactly who made such a decision. Whether or not the other three originalmembers of MötleyCrüe anticipated the ordeal Sixx would endure as a consequence, the longer theFerraroreplacement persisted, the more they were trapped into continuing with it. EvenFerraro himself,whether or not he believed the replacement a temporary stand-in, is now stuck inthe stagepersona - which, in the long run, will probably prove as unfortunate for him asfor Sixx - since,no matter how talented he may be, he is replacing another. Mars and Lee, atleast, seem to haveenough concern and affection for their old friend that they have stayed inoccasional touch withhim and on at least one occasion helped him with funds.To merely expose the situation before the public eye might do damage that wouldhelp noone. Any corporate backers would promptly write off Mötley Crüe as a loss. Mars,Lee, and Neilwould be disgraced for appearing to have cooperated in the abandonment andsuppression oftheir old comrade. Ferraro would appear to have exploited Sixx’ misfortunes andhave deceivedSixx fans. And the real Nikki Sixx, after receiving an initial burst ofpublicity and sympathy,would remain saddled with a felony conviction and denied any royalties deservedfromWarner’s/Elektra.A better solution might be for an out-of-court, private settlement to secure forSixx the past/present/future royalties he deserves, as well as the right to publicly assertthe name Nikki Sixx assoon as the probation/community control is lifted. Alexandre Dumas’ storysuggests a magically-appropriate end to the whole story, wherein - by advance agreement - Ferraroslips quietly out ofthe Nikki Sixx role and the real one just as quietly slips back into it!A move should also be made to throw out the felony conviction, if in fact Sixxwere not aknowing participant in the robbery and did nothing more than drive theperpetrators to thescene, then flee it in panic. He could presumably be criticized for poor tastein choosing friends,and penalized for fleeing the scene of a crime with the perpetrator - but thatis a far cry from afelony conviction for armed robbery on his record, which will haunt and cripplehim throughouthis life.Like Milton’s Satan, Nikki Sixx attained great heights only to fall to thelowest depths. Theissue is now whether, also like Satan, he will be able to rise again to agreater dignity than before:a dignity born of the ordeals he has undergone and survived - loss of fame,wealth, freedom, thenear-loss of his very personality and name. If teenaged fans once cheered him asa symbol ofadolescent Sturm und Drang, people of all ages may now cheer him as one of thoseveryuncommon, very noble individuals who would risk all, endure all - rather thanrefuse to Be.[index-127_1.png][index-127_2.jpg]- 127 -* * * * *Shortly after the first contact from this mysterious individual, I asked Templeof Set AdeptDemon O’Brien, a music industry professional and close personal friend of KISS’Gene Simmons,if she could verify his story. O’Brien telephoned me on January 4, 1986 to saythat she had justmet with Simmons in Knoxville, Tennessee, where KISS was doing a concert, andthat he hadconfirmed to her that Matthew Trippe was indeed the original Nikki Sixx - butthat, since KISSwas also signed with Elektra, he would not say anything publicly about it. Withthis confirmation[and the traffic ticket], I decided to run the Runes story.Subsequently both the American Rolling Stone (June 1988) and the BritishKerrang! (March1988) and New Musical Express (January 1988) ran major stories on theSixx/Trippecontroversy. A lawsuit initiated by Trippe was dismissed for not falling withinthe statute oflimitations. Warner’s/Elektra and the four current members of Mötley Crüe havesteadfastlymaintained that there is no truth whatever to Trippe’s account of events. Hehimself, in Internetinterviews, continues to assert it to this day.The Nine Unknown- by -Nikki Sixx II°May XXII ÆSIn the Eye of SetThere lurks a mysterious,Invisible Force:The Council of Nine.They gather and frownAt the Christians’ crossIn mourning for manAnd for his mind’s loss.Then, in a final flash of glory,SetShalt thou comeTo grace the night.- 128 -[index-129_1.jpg][index-129_2.jpg]- 129 -14: The Abased Eighties II:A Tree in the NorthThe threat of your destruction grows as a tree in the north; its branches reachto coverthe Earth with misery and despair; it consumes being night and day; it slays asthescorpion; it poisons the very air with its stench.

And then woe, woe,woe, woe,woe, woe, yes, woe to the Earth, for its foulness will be great. Heed well thewarning of thisWord.- Tenth Part of the Word of SetThroughout the 1960s and 1970s it was fun to be first a Satanist and later aSetian inAmerica.As recounted in my Church of Satan history, Satanists were generally regarded asthe mostcolorful, exciting, and amusing extreme of what was popularly called the “OccultRevival”movement. Both Anton LaVey’s original Central Grotto in San Francisco and thevarious localGrottos that sprang up around the country became something akin to fashionstatements in theirlocales. They were exciting to join or visit; their rituals and ceremonies couldbe counted upon tobe spooky, spectacular, scary, and slapstick. A local Satanist, or better yetPriest or Priestess ofthe Church, was a guaranteed draw for any kind of lecture, seminar, media talkshow, orHalloween party.Even conventional churches, which one would think would be horrified at such asinistercompetitor in their midst, often found themselves enjoying the novelty in spiteof themselves.After all, it gave them something tangible to righteously denounce. It got theminto show biz too,because local television and radio stations quickly figured out that the bestdebate opponent for aprofessional Satanist was a professional Christian.And Hollywood happily fanned the flames. From Rosemary’s Baby in 1966 to TheExorcist in1974, showdowns between the Devil and God were big box-office.When the Temple of Set was founded in 1975, indeed, those of us who had resignedfrom theChurch of Satan to create this new institution felt that it was time to calmdown a little. TheChurch had remained such a darling of the media that Satanists found their timetaken uplargely by public relations events. There just wasn’t time for serious BlackMagic, which, after all,was what becoming a Satanist was supposed to be all about.Furthermore the Temple of Set was finally facing head-on what its predecessorhad been tap-dancing around for the previous decade: that there was a serious, sophisticated,and potentially- 130 -very illuminating foundation for this “religion of otherness”. In this theTemple also benefittedfrom divesting itself completely of Judæo-Christian mythology, ideology, andsymbolism. Weharked back instead to pre-J/C ancient Egypt, and an interpretation of itsmetaphysics thatpromised to open a door to the divinity of each initiated individual.And so it was for the Temple’s first decade as well - with one difference: thatwe determinedfrom the outSet that our attention would always be devoted to our ownmembership’s benefit.We were not there to entertain, fascinate, or stimulate the public any more. Somodest andprivate was the Temple of Set, indeed, that the outside world scarcely knew wewere there at all.That was just fine with Setians as we settled down to explore the greatmysteries of philosophy,magic, and metaphysics.And we expected it would continue pleasantly on that way forever. None of us,myselfincluded, ever anticipated the nightmare that awaited not justSatanists/Setians, but indeed theentire “occult subculture” - and many who weren’t actually part of it at all -in the 1980s.It began in 1977 when a man named Lawrence Pazder published a book entitledMichelleRemembers. In this book he alleged that his wife Michelle had as an infant beenkidnapped andsexually abused by Satanists, then had “repressed” all memories of theexperience until heelicited them from her as an adult through “therapy sessions”.I remember that when we first heard of it, we all laughed it off as ludicrous,and certainly tootransparently so for anyone to take seriously. It was soon to be found on“remaindered” saletables, from one of which I picked up my own copy.But away from our amused and contemptuous dismissal, it happened that many othereyeswere reading the book and taking it very seriously indeed. Or, moremalevolently, seeing in it anew technique for acquiring power, fame, and money by imitating its theme.Michelle Remembers was ultimately exposed as a fraud, but by then its damage hadbeendone, and that damage proved to be horrific and incalculable, destroying lives,families, andsocieties throughout many countries.The ominous consequences of Michelle Remembers first came to widespread publicattentionin 1983, when a mentally-ill woman named Judy Johnson, on the sole “evidence” ofher son’sirritated anus, made an accusation of “Satanic child-molestation” against theMcMartinPreschool in Los Angeles. Although the child’s doctor and father saw nothingunusual about theirritation, and although Johnson was later diagnosed as an acute paranoidschizophreniac, thedamage was done and the McMartin witch-hunt was ignited. It was to end in courtseven yearslater with no finding of any abuse by anyone at the day-care center.The nationwide drama and sensationalism associated with Michelle Remembers andtheMcMartin case ignited an epidemic of “day-care Satanic sex abuse” witch-huntsacross theUnited States. While many persons were prosecuted and convicted of sex-abuse asaconsequence, not one instance of “Satanism” in connection with either childabuse or day-carecenter activity was ever demonstrated.The Department of Defense community was not immune from the epidemic. ByNovember1987 there had been 15 child-sex-abuse accusation scares at Army day-carecenters andelementary schools alone. In late 1986 it was the turn of the Presidio of SanFrancisco.On 9/28/86 the San Francisco Examiner began a series of 8 front-page storiessensationalizing the witch-hunts. Approximately a month later one set ofPresidio parentsclaimed that their son might have been anally raped by one of the day-careteachers, GaryHambright, and the scare was off and running, with scores of children being“abuse-diagnosed”by a “play-therapist” despite not a single published confirmation of actualphysical harm to anychild. Hambright denied any “abusing” whatever, and all of the other teachersand staffsupported him.- 131 -As in other witch-hunts it made no difference: Over the next year Hambright wassuspended,indicted, charges dropped, reindicted, charges redropped amidst a massive mediafrenzy.Parents rushed to file over $74 million in claims, as was also routine in suchwitch-hunts. [Theprevious year a similar, highly-publicized witch-hunt at West Point had resultedin $110 millionclaims.]Left out of the Presidio claims bonanza were Christian chaplain LarryAdams-Thompson andhis wife Michele, who had never reported their daughter Kinsey Almond for anyphysical orpsychological symptoms during the entire time she had been under Hambright’ssupervision atthe day-care center (9/1-10/31/86). In their original 1/87 FBI interviews bothA-Ts were specificabout that date- window, because Almond turned 3 on 9/1/86 and, as confirmed bythe PresidioDirector of Personnel & Community Affairs, Hambright supervised only childrenage 3 andolder.Despite Almond’s untouched state [on 3/12/87 Presidio doctors examined her andpronounced her a virgin free from any physical signs of abuse], the A-Ts placedher in anintensive 8-month program of “play-therapy”. The same “therapist” who pronouncedthe scoresof other children “abused” soon pronounced Almond “abused” as well.The A-Ts, however, were not content with just accusing Hambright. In 6/87Micheleintroduced “SRA” themes and insinuations about me - who had been a topic ofcuriosity andgossip as a famous “Satanist” officer throughout my 1981-86 assignment to thePresidioHeadquarters - to the “therapist”. Then on 8/13/87 the A-Ts saw my wife Lilithand myself at thePresidio post exchange and went running to the witch-hunt investigators allegingthat Almondhad accused us of kidnapping and raping her while she was under Hambright’ssupervision.[They then climbed on board the financial bandwagon with a $3 million claim oftheir own basedon their faked story.] This quickly resulted in an even more sensationalisticinternational mediastorm.The San Francisco Police investigated, verified that Lilith and I had been 3,000miles away inWashington, D.C. - where I was on duty every single day Almond was at thedaycare center9/1-10/31/86 - and closed the case with no charges accordingly.In October 1988, however, I appeared as a panelist on a Geraldo Rivera Halloweenspecial.Rivera was trying to sensationalize and encourage the “SRA” witchhunt mania, andI wasspeaking out against it. The broadcast came to the attention of Senator JesseHelms, whobecame enraged that a Lt. Colonel in the Army should dare to hold a “Satanic”religion. AsFreedom of Information Act filings later revealed, Helms then secretly contactedhis closepersonal friend, Secretary of the Army John Marsh, and insisted that Marshdevise some way todestroy my career.As my 20-year military record was without blemish [In 1987 I was the sole U.S.Army Reserveofficer in the nation selected to attend the prestigious National DefenseUniversity/IndustrialCollege of the Armed Forces], the only way to act on Helms’ demand was to try torevive thechaplain’s scheme to threaten Lilith and myself, apparently expecting that withsufficientintimidation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) I would resignand “disappear”.[It didn't work.]The CID first (1/89) illegally forced a fulltime active duty board to deny me anew fulltimecontract on expiration of my current one in 9/90. Six months later, after a sham“reinvestigation”, it issued a report “titling” Lilith and myself for thechaplain’s allegations.[“Titling” is a statement by the CID that it thinks a crime occurred.]Nevertheless the report itselfcontained not a single item of “evidence” other than the A-Ts’ allegations thatany crimewhatever had occurred - and either suppressed or ignored abundant evidence ofour innocenceand the A-Ts’ violations.- 132 -[For example, the CID tried to get around our 3,000-miles-away proof ofinnocence byfinding out when we had previously been in San Francisco - several months beforethe 9-10/86“window” - and then (in 1989) simply revising the allegation to that date! Whenthe CID thenlearned that that this manufactured redate made the A-Ts’ alleged locationphysicallyimpossible, it then (in 1991) proceeded to invent a new location, once again onno groundsexcept its 1991 predicament. Both the manufactured “redating” and “relocating”necessarilymade numerous additional elements of the chaplain’s original fabricationimpossible as well -inconvenient complications that the CID addressed by simply ignoring them.]What this bizarre exercise in “manufactured evidence” did demonstrate was thestrength ofthe political agenda predetermining the CID’s “reinvestigation” from the outset.[For instance,the CID’s illegal fixing of the fulltime-duty board took place at the beginningof its“reinvestigation” - half a year before it was supposedly able to perform theevaluation of thatinvestigation.] Clearly an exposé that we had in fact been the innocent victimsof a cold-blooded,calculated scheme to defraud the government - by a Christian chaplain - waspolitically out ofthe question from the beginning.My repeated demands that those responsible for the CID action, as well as thechaplain, becourt-martialed for false official statements, manufacture of evidence,obstruction of justice,misprision of serious offense, attempted $3 million defrauding of thegovernment, and severalother UCMJ and federal law violations, were similarly - and equally illegally -suppressed. TheCID’s response was to say that I was “swearing falsely” to these facts.Nevertheless it could not -and did not - produce even a single example of any such “factual falsehood” inthe documents Ifiled and swore to under penalty of perjury. [Nor, of course, was I ever chargedwith making evena single “false statement”.]No charges at all resulted from the CID report. Not so much as even a letter ofreprimand.The Army had known from the outset that the chaplain’s allegations werefraudulent, of course.By administrative complaint process in 1990 we were able to have the “SRAtitling” of Lilithremoved. The CID refused to remove mine - although the A-Ts had always allegedwe “did theSRA together” - because to do so would have exploded the entire CID operationand opened atrail of serious law violations leading to Helms and Secretary of the ArmyMarsh.I next filed suit in federal court in 1990 to have the rest of the CID reportexposed andretracted. The U.S. Privacy Act would have forced a comparison of every CIDstatement in thereport with the actual facts (a de novo judicial review). For this reason theCID argued intenselythat its reports should be immune from de novo review.The case was filed as a Motion for Summary Judgment. There was no jury orin-courttestimony. We assumed that the CID’s legal violations were so flagrant, obvious,and numerousthat a simple ruling by the judge would suffice.To our surprise the judge ruled that all CID reports were indeed exempt from denovo judicialreview, and that the CID could conclude whatever it wished from its report aswritten.We appealed, and the appeals court upheld the district judge’s decision toexempt CIDreports from the Privacy Act. Again in its decision, the appeals court recitedas “facts” excerptsfrom the very CID document whose falsehoods were the issue of the entirelawsuit.Following the lawsuit I detailed and documented the CID lawyer’s extensive liesin briefs &oral argument to the Army Inspector General, Judge Advocate General, and finallythe ArmyChief of Staff.None of my facts or documents was disputed or refuted, but neither was anyaction taken tocourt-martial those responsible. This effectively exhausted my options.The bottom line was that on one hand the politically-driven “black bag job” tointimidate meout of the Army had failed, and indeed could not withstand many other decent andhonorableoffices and officials in the same Army who, as they learned about the scheme,refused to aid,[index-133_1.jpg][index-133_2.png]- 133 -abet, or tolerate it. [This included every single superior officer in my ownchain of commandthroughout all the years of the initial attack against us and the subsequentinvestigations.]On the other hand we came to realize that it was politically out of the questionthat aChristian chaplain be court-martialed for crimes committed against a “Satanist”and his wife, orthat trails of illegal actions leading to powerful national political figureswould be followed. Andwe also learned that the courts were also not about to force exposure such awidespread andpotentially politically-explosive cover-up as this one.On the expiration of my fulltime active duty contract in 1990, I continued as apart-timeactive USAR officer for the next four years, assigned to Headquarters US SpaceCommand withan above-Top Secret clearance. I decided to retire from the Active Reserve in1994, and at thattime received the Meritorious Service Medal from the [new] Secretary of theArmy, covering1984-1994. I remain today in the Army as a Lt. Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired).Most people will find it sufficient, I think, that Lilith and I were nevercharged with anythingafter two long investigations (SFPD/FBI, CID), that I retained my TS+ clearance,and that Iretired honorably in 1994. All of my Officer Efficiency Reports from the time ofthe attack on usto my 1994 retirement also continued to give me the highest possible evaluationsin allcategories.My military service and present Army-Retired status are public record and can beindependently verified by anyone wishing to take the trouble.Nor is the 1990 lawsuit in any sense a “skeleton in my closet”. A review of myattorney’sdistrict & appeals briefs & orals will glaringly expose what was actually takingplace: a court- 134 -coverup of blatant Senatorial/SecArmy/CID misconduct - and simultaneousbrushing-aside ofnumerous illegal actions against an Army officer and his wife of a “politicallyincorrect” religion.By the end of the 1980s the “SRA” urban myth had been exhausted: It had becomeconspicuously obvious to all but the most irrational fanatics that not a singleone of the stagedwitch-hunts had actually produced any Satanists or Satanic cults. Also,law-enforcement andchild-protective authorities, which had been caught off-guard by the decade ofhysteria, had bynow completed their own methodical studies. The consensus was that “SRA”:• - does not exist in the United States, as reported by the FBI’s NationalCenter for theAnalysis of Violent Crime in 1992, after an 11-year study. “There are manychildren in theUnited States who, starting early in their lives, are severely psychologically,physically,and sexually traumatized by angry, sadistic parents or other adults. Such abuse,however,is not perpetrated only or primarily by satanists. The statistical odds are thatsuch abusersare members of mainstream religions ... For the last eight years American lawenforcement has been aggressively investigating the allegations of victims ofritual abuse.There is little or no evidence for the portion of their allegations that dealswith large-scalebaby-breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies.” (Investigator’sGuide to Allegations of “Ritual” Child Abuse, January 1992)• - does not exist in the United States, as concluded by an exhaustive nationalstudy for theNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect: “In a survey of more than 11,000psychiatricand police workers throughout the country, conducted for the National Center onChildAbuse and Neglect, researchers found more than 12,000 accusations of group cultsexualabuse based on Satanic ritual, but not one that investigators had been able tosubstantiate. ‘After scouring the country, we found no evidence for large-scalecults thatsexually abuse children,’ said Dr. Gail Goodman, a psychologist at theUniversity ofCalifornia at Davis, who directed the survey. The survey included 6,910psychiatrists,psychologists, and clinical social workers; and 4,655 district attorneys, policedepartments, and social service agencies. They reported 12,264 accusations ofritual abusethat they had investigated. The survey found that there was not a single caseamongthem where there was clear corroborating evidence for the most commonaccusation, thatthere was “a well-organized, intergenerational Satanic cult who sexuallymolested andtortured children in their homes or schools for years and committed a series ofmurders,”said Goodman. (Daniel Goleman, New York Times, reprinted San Francisco Chronicle11/1/94)• - does not exist in the United Kingdom, as reported by the BritishGovernment’sDepartment of Health in 1994, after a three-year investigation. “There is noevidence thatthese [“Satanic ritual abuse”] have taken place in any of the 84 cases studied... The studyof cases in detail showed that the Evangelical Christian campaign against newreligiousmovements has been a powerful influence encouraging the identification ofsatanic abuse.Equally important in spreading the idea of satanic abuse in Britain are theprofessional‘specialists’, American and British. Their claims or qualifications are rarelychecked. Muchof their information, particularly about cases in the United States, isunreliable.” ( TheExtent and Nature of Organised and Ritual Abuse, HMSO, 1994)And so it was finally over for Setians, Satanists, Wiccans, neopagans, andsimilar targets ofone of the most sustained, horrific, and vicious witch-hunts since the MiddleAges.- 135 -But it was not over for many of the proponents and profiteers. What theyrealized was thatthere was still publicity to be milked, and massive amounts of money to be madethrough claimsand lawsuits - only now from targets much more accessible and vulnerable thannonexistent“Satanic cults”. Now accusations and “recovered memories” were directed againstparents andclose family relatives, whose proximity and opportunity were undeniable andindefensible. Ashort time later the international Catholic Church, whose priests have extensiveeducationalcontact with parishioners’ children, became an even more popular and lucrativetarget - themore so since, unlike the “SRA” myth, this church was indeed found to have amajor child sexualabuse problem.From the time of its founding in 1975, the Temple of Set had determined that oneof thefeatures of the Church of Satan it would not emulate was that institution’scourting of publicity.While somewhat entertaining, as well as being free advertisement for newSatanists, the constantpublic appearances by both Anton LaVey and the national Priesthood had not onlysapped thetime and energy of both, but had seduced all of us into more “media whoredom”than we caredto admit. Indeed it was in part the Church of Satan’s struggle to live up to itsabsurdly-inflated“legend” that precipitated Anton’s effort to dismantle the actual organizationin 1974 in favor ofan invisible, untraceable “Movement” whose image he could spin without fear ofcontradictionby reality.The Temple of Set couldn’t care less about publicity; in fact it actively soughtto avoid it. Wewere building an initiatory environment and “toolbox” for Setians, not fornonSetians’entertainment or diversion. If that meant we grew only by word-of-mouth, andthat withpainstaking deliberation, so much the better.This policy served the Temple just fine - until the completely-unexpectedanti-Satanicwitchhunts of the later-1980s. Suddenly the almost complete mystery of theTemple of Set madeit the world’s most-feared suspect institution, displacing yesterday’s hats suchas the TrilateralCommission, the Illuminati, and the Freemasons.Much to my annoyance, therefore - and also in obvious response to the “SRA”attack on Lilithand myself - I began accepting speaking engagements as well as radio andtelevision interviews.Over the next several years I explained and re-explained the Temple of Set,Setian philosophy,and “why we had nothing to do with stereotypical anti-Judæo/ChristianDevil-worship” to OprahWinfrey, Geraldo Rivera, and a seemingly-endless host of their fellowjournalists. Other Templeofficials, among them Stephen Flowers, Robert Menschel, and Patty Hardy, alsoaccepted similarengagements. Not lost on me was the considerable personal risk they took byappearing beforefearful, often hostile audiences.There were a few moments of incidental slapstick. On one occasion StephenFlowers and Iwere invited down to Killeen, Texas to appear on a “Satanic crime” panel at amultistate law-enforcement convention. To illustrate the difference between “HollywoodSatanism” and what Iintended to describe as the real thing, I began [against both Stephen’s andLilith’s advice] with afilm clip from The Devil’s Rain in which Ernest Borgnine, after transforminginto a hideous goat-demon, magically burns the eyes out of William Shatner [who, fortunately, gotthem back in timefor the Star Trek movie revival the next year]. When I switched off theprojector and turned thelights on, I was dumbfounded to see an auditoriumful of starkly-horrifiedpolicemen, sheriffs,and even the Texas Rangers!Later during that panel discussion, Pat Pulling, president of “Mothers AgainstDungeons &Dragons” (another obvious Satanic conspiracy to destroy the minds of America’syouth) wasasked if she considered me a “good Satanist”. She responded, “I’m sure he’s agood man. I can’tbring myself to use the words ‘good’ and ‘Satanist’ in the same sentence.”Stephen and I left Killeen the next day after being presented with Honorarybadges in itsPolice Department.- 136 -As the “SRA” urban myth fizzled out in the 1990s, so did the need for suchappearances - andof course by now the Temple of Set was no longer a mystery to anyone, thougharguably stillsomewhat incomprehensible. During one commercial break on his show, GeraldoRivera askedme if I would please stick to words of no more than two syllables so as not tolost the televisionaudience.Upon resuming the High Priesthood after the departure of Ronald Barrett, myoriginalintention was just to rebuild and update the Temple, then pass it again to thenext generation ofSetians. The dangers of the 1980s changed all that. I felt myself far better tocope with them onbehalf of the Temple than anyone else, so I determined to stay on post until Iwas satisfied thatthe danger was past. By the mid-1990s this was safely evident.Looking back on that experience, I am reminded of a poem of my mother, [laterSetianPriestess] Betty Ford, composed at age 13:Forced EntranceThere came a time when they were not contentTo shriek against the portals and the shrine.They crushed the silver gates, and in they went,Hot-handed, on a search for the Divine.And the white portals opened ceaselessly,And the great purple curtains flapped and fell,And the great mass of people swept to seeNaked Untruth, but how they could not tell.Still they found nothing godlike, but a throneEmpty and time-worn, in an empty hall,And a white heap of manuscripts, alone,And the Sun’s rays that fell, nor ceased to fall.And, in one sheltered crevasse they went by,A flight of stairs that wound into the sky.[index-137_1.jpg][index-137_2.jpg]- 137 -15: A Passing-ByThe abasements of the 1980s notwithstanding, the history of the Temple of Setfrom myresumption of the High Priesthood in 1981 to my retirement from it in 1996 was aperiod ofunmarred pleasure and pleasantness for the Temple of Set. There were occasionaldifferences ofopinion among Setians given our widely-cast net of interests; unsurprisinglynone of thesedeterred or disrupted the primary goals of expansion of the Order/Pylon/Elementsystem andthe development of the Temple’s publications and access to them.When I first conceived this memoir, it was my intention to include names andcommentariesconcerning every significant Setian magician and philosopher who raised theTemple to itspresent plateau of excellence. I soon realized that, particularly in thepost-1981 window, thiswould be an impossibility; there are just too many of them, and their influencecannot possiblybe summarized in a few paragraphs. So I will defer that task to the Temple’sother historicalarchives, particularly the Scroll of Set and the several Order, Element, andPylon publications.My goal in this Temple of Set thus became far more modest: to recount the early,formativestages of the Temple’s construction, and to summarize what might be called“Setian philosophy”in its most simplified form. The former (Part I) thus concludes with thischapter, while the lattercommences immediately following it (Part II).In the June 1996 Scroll of Set I finally laid aside my High Priesthood thus:Sexem-fs em utu arit er-a tep ta. “He has gained the mastery of what was setforth tobe done for me upon Earth.” - Stele of Set, X ÆSThe Heb-Sed Festival of XXX/1995 resulted in many memorable works and events,and each ofus who passed through it emerged enriched and fulfilled by its aurora.In my own case it brought about extensive meditation on my own role within andresponsibilities to the Temple, as I have Understood them to be since the NorthSolstice Workingof X/1975. I have come to the conclusion that the sacred charge given to me asHigh Priest of Sethas now been fulfilled, and that upon the North Solstice of this year I amtherefore called to retirefrom this office.Subsequently I will continue to handle routine administrative tasks of theoffice in a transitioncapacity until a successor has been confirmed by the Council of Nine. I will ofcourse workcooperatively with that successor and with the Executive Director to ensure thatthe transition ofall Temple operations is as efficient and seamless as possible. I suggest theforthcoming Set-XVIIInternational Conclave this November as an opportune occasion for ceremonialobservance of thenew High Priesthood.Henceforth I will accept no offices in the Temple, but will of course remainactive andcontributive as an individual Initiate. I desire, for instance, to continue andexpand my historicaland archival work, as in the recent Scroll project, to make more and more of thetreasures of the- 138 -past two decades of the Æon easily and coherently available to the Setians oftoday and tomorrow,through both Glinda and other media as opportune and appropriate.At the time of the founding of the Temple, I Understood the High Priesthood tobe not alifetime station for the individual so entrusted, but rather a reflection ofwhichever Initiate withinthe Priesthood appeared most singularly to be the High Priest or Priestess ofSet at a given point intime. Such a person would possess and display a unique intimacy with Set, andfrom this wouldradiate a passionate guardianship over the Priesthood consecrated to him, andmore generallyover the Temple dedicated in his name.It is thus no single criterion, but a mix of them which characterizes the HighPriesthood.Perhaps most pointedly, it is by no means simply a measure of sincerity,integrity, or personaldedication to one’s Priesthood. Were this the case, all true Priests andPriestesses could assuredlyadd the “High”-prefix. Nor is it primarily a measure of seniority, wisdom,experience, andinitiatory Understanding, else every Master of the Temple would certainly be socalled.The Heb-Sed gave me the opportunity not only to consider my own High Priesthood,but toreflect upon all of the Masters as possible successors. I have done so andshared my thoughts withthe Masters of the Temple, whose discussions and deliberations will similarlyflow into the Councilof Nine during its formal nomination and confirmation process.I have now been an Initiate of the Priesthood for 26 years and High Priest for aWorking periodof 18 years [as Magus Ronald K. Barrett held the office for the 3 years mid-79to mid-82]. It hasbeen an exhilarating, inspiring, and above all soul-transforming experience. Ibelieve I have donemy very best to do “what was set forth to be done”, and I am so very proud ofthe Temple and sovery appreciative of the opportunity to work with and learn from all the Setiansover the years,senior and junior, old friends and new ones alike. The Temple of Set is amagical mirror of all theInitiates who have passed through its pylons, and what a majestic, delightful,and authenticreflection that is!From the moment of its [re]creation in 1975, we have instinctively felt theTemple of Set to besomething unprecedented on this world. It crystallized a premise at once moreambitious andmore subtle than that of its Church of Satan prelude. And unlike the cynicalpessimism of theChurch, the Temple has always had about it a wondrous exuberance, anelectrifying optimism, apromise of wonders and marvels to be enjoyed by all who ventured through itspylons. We maynot have anticipated all of these discoveries accurately on our first exposureto them - and onoccasion some Initiates have found the light too intense for theirself-possession - but suchgrowing pains as we have experienced have never eclipsed the magic andmagnificence of theÆonic current. And no one who has experienced initiation as catalyzed by theTemple, whethertemporarily or over an enduring period, has been unaffected by it.No initiatory system exists in a vacuum. The great temples and orders of historyall wereenhancements of, or reactions to social currents and critical events in theirtime. The Temple ofSet has similarly remanifested amidst the dramatic and stormy fluctuations ofWestern civilizationfrom the 1970s to the 1990s: “the best of times, the worst of times”. Neverbefore in recordedhistory have so many social absolutes disintegrated into relatives, while at thesame timetechnology has exploded into uncontrollable and addictive extremes. Never beforehas theindividual been able to gather information so quickly, communicate soefficiently, travel so easily.Yet paradoxically humans have never felt so anonymous, powerless, and alienated:infinitesimalcogs in a giant Metropolis machine of history careening onward out of control.In and by the Temple of Set we have asserted something in each initiated humanwhich isimmortal, ineffably noble, and blissfully sublime. We have worked with it,played with it, dreamedabout it, and found in it something which we could indeed worship with unashamedreverence -when all around us the remnants of the world’s conventional religions are sodesiccated as tohardly be worth even the shadow of contempt.Ultimately, then, what the Temple of Set has done has been to restore to us anawareness ofthe great dignity of individual consciousness. Once we are awakened to this, allelse that we doflows from it as remanifestations of the respective neteru.This too is why the real Temple of Set can never be perverted, corrupted, ordestroyed. Theinstitution we have built over the years to symbolize, facilitate, and operatethe Temple was andremains a tool of convenience, a means of bridging the realms of magic and nœsisto those ofscience and dianoia. The better we refine the bridge, the more efficient we makethe tool, the more- 139 -fluent we become in this adventure and the easier it is to teach its techniquesto others. Butdestroy the bridge and you have still not in the least damaged the Gift of Setitself.In Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy the First Foundation proved invinciblebecause itsexistence was mandated by a principle larger than itself - in that casehypothetical metacycles ofcivilization called “psychohistory”. The Temple and Æon of Set are similarlymandated by thetranscendent principle of what Eric Hoffer called “the unnaturalness of humannature”, as well asby the capacity and drive of this “unnature” to evolve towards divinity: Xeper.While the Judæo/Christian tradition has demonized and tried to pervert orexterminate thisquality, greater philosophies and philosophers have sought it, romanticized it,exalted it. It isNietzsche’s “horizon building”, the Taoists’ “secret of the Golden Flower”, theGrail, the Agathon,the Philosopher’s Stone, Runa:I must, before I die, find some way to say the essential thing that is in me,that I havenever said yet - a thing that is not love or hate or pity or scorn, but the verybreath of life,fierce and coming from far away, bringing into human life the vastness and thefearfulpassionless force of non-human things ... - Bertrand Russell, quoted in ColinWilson’s TheMind ParasitesMy final charge to the Temple of Set as High Priest of Set is therefore simplyto never forgetthis Gift of Set as the central force underlying our many specialized arts,sciences, investigations,applications, experiments, and pleasures.The Italian automobile constructor Enzo Ferrari was world-renowned for thesensuous, feralmachines he created, as well as for the melodramatic controversies thatconstantly swirled aroundhis explosive personality. Some revered him as a saint; others hated his guts;most felt bothemotions simultaneously without any apology for inconsistency. As with Asimov,Hoffer, Russell,and Nietzsche, the magnetism and the immortality of the Ferrari phenomenon layin somethingmuch more subtle and powerful than mere skill at building exotic cars. In Enzo’sspiritualtestament he finally revealed his secret:... ho dedicato la mia vita all’automobile: una conquista di libertà per l’uomo... [Ihave devoted my life to the automobile, which has won the human race itsfreedom.]And there you have it again. He sought to capture in machinery what a Blake didin art, aVaughan Williams in music, a Milton in prose, a Clark Ashton Smith in poetry:the ecstasy ofsurpassing one’s presumed limitations of self, of shattering the spear of theuniverse that is with aself-created sword of the universe yet to Come Into Being. The Children of Setmust never aspireto less.I appreciate beyond expression all the encouragement, support, affection, andloyalty you haveso graciously extended to me as High Priest of Set these many years. And I lookforward toenjoying with you many more mysteries of the Great Black Magic as it continuesto illuminate forus horizons beyond our darkest dreams.At the Set-XVII International Conclave in San Francisco that November, Set,speakingthrough his Council of Nine, entrusted his High Priesthood to Magus Don Webb,who for thesubsequent 1-1/2 decades far exceeded my own contributions and competence inthat office.When it was formally transferred, he presented me with an engraved black-marbledplaque onbehalf of the Temple. Beneath a mirror-engraved Pentagram of Set is inscribed:[index-140_1.jpg]- 140 -For Michael A. AquinoA STELAComposed on the First Day of the Egyptian NewYear as a Magical Link of the eternal Respect, Loveand Blessings that flow to him from the Dwellersin the Æon of Set now and forever. 8/1/XXXII played my flute in the desert night,and a special few heard the silvery call.It was as subtle as the gem-hues of the Dark Light,but it made for the Mind an everlasting Hall.I gave what I had, which was the Way to the stars,I gave it with tears and blood and sweat,I gave it with Love, for with Love it had been made mine.And they saw my magic treasure, saw it Dark and Fine,and heard it in their words, and drank it when they met,and they grew wise on this earth, and shone among the stars.I will not be remembered by all,I didn’t disturb the sands of time with Might,but I will always be Remembered by those who Heard the Call,when I played my flute in the desert night.[index-141_1.png]- 141 -"},{"pageContent":"PART II: CONCEPTS- 142 -[index-143_1.jpg][index-143_2.jpg]- 143 -16: The Black Magical Theory of the UniverseThe true nature of what is spiritual and what is merely nonsense is hard toagree upon. Aprecise line cannot be drawn between faith, superstition, and science. All wecan say withoutargument is that there is a larger reality which is beyond our comprehension. Wedon’t have aname for it, but we know it exists. In practice we find ourselves breakingthrough, at times, to anexpanded reality in which we are able to perceive a whole new set of mysterieswhich wereformerly invisible to us. Then we discover the limitations of this new awarenessand must breakthrough yet again. This process is, as far as I have been able to discern,endless.Ultimately no amount of study will lead us to the whole truth. Even if we workcontinually fora lifetime, we will never come to the end of our explorations about truth. Thisis where faith comesin. We accept the truth of theories we cannot prove, and in that way perceivethe whole picture,though its complete structure is beyond our understanding.- David Carradine, The Spirit of Shaolin, 1991A. TheoryBefore advancing the theory identified by the title of this chapter, it may beuseful to reviewjust what any “theory” is - and what it is not.Definition: A theory is an organized set of ideas about reality.Why is theory useful? (1) It enables data to be ordered. (2) It requires thatthe criteria ofselection of problems for analysis be made explicit. (3) It is an instrument forunderstandingsimilarities and differences.Theories can be descriptive (classifying a phenomenon or placing it within aconceptualframework) or prescriptive (advancing a set of norms or values).One must assess a theory either as (1) a passionate statement or (2) an honestattempt tostate truth.A theory should be critiqued on the plane of its logic and internal consistency,not on thebasis of its popular acceptance and influence [this echoes Plato’s condemnationof what hederisively called the “democratization of truth”].The only absolutely general standard of rational criticism is that a theorymustn’t containmutually-contradictory propositions.- 144 -B. Types of TheoriesEthical theories express some degree of preference or distaste about reality inaccordancewith certain a priori standards of evaluation. Some ethical theories state idealgoals towardswhich reality ought to be changed. [Chapter #19 contains ethical theories.]Metaphysical theories are attempts to discover the ultimate nature of realitytranscendingthe observable. [This chapter contains metaphysical theories.]Empirical theories are generalizations about observable realities. [This chaptercontainsempirical theories preliminary to and supportive of the metaphysical theoriespresented.]A political theory is a disinterested search for knowledge of political andsocial reality. It isa set of empirically-validated, logically-ordered, and functionally-relatedpropositions about theactual political behavior of individuals and societies. It contains (1) factualstatements about theexisting posture of affairs, (2) causal statements about probabilities, and (3)value statements.[Chapter #19 contains political theories as an illustration and application ofthe ethical theoriestreated.]C. The MultiverseBefore one can venture an intelligent decision concerning what to do with one’sexistence,one must know what that existence is and in what environment it is situated.Many of history’smajor religions and philosophies came into being in order to address thisproblem. While someof their proposed explanations are æsthetically and/or emotionally attractiveand have gainedmany devotees, this in itself does not make any one of them true - merelypopular.The Temple of Set proposes its solution after having considered and dismissedthealternatives as untrue in whole or in part. We consider our position to be theonly correct one -not because we are intolerant of competition or comparison, but rather becausewe do not acceptthe notion of coexisting but incompatible “truths”. If there is an evidentfallacy or unknownfactor in the truth as we understand it, then we must address and if possiblecorrect it - or atleast identify the fallacy or factor and qualify the stated truth accordingly.But to say “ours is justone approach, and many others are just as good” is an evasion of responsibilityand wouldreduce the concept of “truth” to merely a matter of whim [or popularity].Most humans assume “the Universe” to be the totality of existence, by which theymean thephysical assemblage of matter and energy along with whatever presence humanityhas within it.This necessarily reduces that human presence to a mere aspect or reflection ofthat physicality.Setian philosophy rejects such crude oversimplification as both factuallyinaccurate andintellectually lazy. Since “uni-” implies a whole, we begin by replacing “theUniverse” with“Multiverse”: an infinite multiplicity of -verses. This Multiverse is dividedinto a singleassemblage of matter/energy [balanced cosmically by an equivalence of antimatterandantienergy] which we shall call the Objective Universe (OU), and individualperceived and/orcreated -verses generated by each self-aware conscious entity: SubjectiveUniverses (SU).D. The Objective Universe1. OriginThe issue of the origin of the OU is crucial to conventional religions and mostphilosophies.There are two alternatives:- 145 -• Something created it at a point in time, or• It has always existed, and therefore no creating agent was/is necessary.Since infinites of anything can only be theoretically conceptualized, and thenwith greatdifficulty, most humans find the “created” option easier to assume. If thisoption is true,however, it necessitates the existence of a creative, originating agency priorand superior to theOU: conventionally called “gods”/“God”. This in turn necessitates an origin andsource for saidg/God(s), which then requires an even higher/prior source, ad infinitum.Conventional humanreligions generally limit the conversation to just the first g/G, consideringthat difficult enoughwith which to grapple. [This of course does not make the annoying “higher/prior”question goaway.]Similarly swept under the rug is the reason for the OU’s creation andcomposition.Conventional religions simply presume that g/G did it on whim, which is as goodan answer asany. Nevertheless in the latter part of the 20th Century CE this considerationannoyed an upstartfield of philosophy called “Existentialism”, which, in the vernacular of one ofits laureates Jean-Paul Sartre, regarded the phenomenon of physical existence to be intrusive,jarring, and obsceneto the point of causing “nausea” in the human apprehender. The implicit premiseis that atotality of nonexistence, an “absentiverse”, would be more serene. Whileabstractly that is hardto dispute, it also begs the question: The OU is very obviously here; and,nauseated or not,humans must deal with it. [Existentialists tend to shun a reasoned solution infavor ofunmotivated instinct.]Additionally with the “creation” option there is the question of “the artist’scanvas”. The OUconsists of a presumably finite amount of extant phenomena: the aforementionedmatter/antimatter/energy. Beyond this composition lies ... what? A theoreticallyinfinite expanse ofnothingness? Does such an “unpainted canvas” also necessitate its originalestablishment? Or, asExistentialism postulates, is it a state of inherent purity requiring absolutelynothing external toits nonself?As if these causality consequences aren’t annoying enough in themselves, theyalso imply aunidirectional timeline from creation to omnipresence or entropic exhaustion.This in turnimplies a purpose to the process, and for intelligent beings a mission for them.It is just such amission that conventional religions profess to recognize and advocate.The alternative to this creation presumption and all of its baggage is almostblissful in itssimplicity: It is that there was no point or purpose of creation, no ultimateend, and of course nopathway or mission between them. Rather the OU has always existed as it is, andalways willcontinue to. No “creative concept” or agency is thus needed. The concept of“time” refers to themeasurement of changing objects/energies and the relationships between them, butismeaningless in terms of some overall forced-march. In time-theory a directed OUischaracterized by “linear time”, and its destination called “eschatology”. Theconventional religionof Judaism and its Christian and Islamic variations are eschatological, whichaccounts for theirclimate of dogmatic belief and obedience.By contrast, ancient metaphysical schools such as that of Egypt perceived timeas “cyclical”or “circular”. Virtue and healthy living were sought in harmony with theconstant cycles andpermanences of nature, for which there was no element of urgency. In themillennia of recordedEgyptian history, there was no essential difference between the first and thelast dynasties savein their incarnated personalities. “Progress” would have been thought an oddnotion indeed.Cosmologically the Temple of Set inclines to the timelessness of the secondexistentialoption. The neteru - the universal Principles espoused by Ayesha, the Forms ofPythagoras andPlato - were, are, and will be eternal in the precise sense of that term.Worship of them is to befound in harmony, not slavery.- 146 -2. Enforcement: Proof of the NeteruWhile there is no necessity to establish creation of the OU per se, itsstability andperpetuation is another matter entirely. Everywhere and at every moment it ischaracterized byconsistency in its behavior: what philosophers generally refer to as “naturallaw”. Thisconsistency exists, the OU is not a random, kaleidoscopic chaos, because a forcegreater than it,beyond it, insists upon its structure and order: the neteru.The collective natural law of the neteru is perceived, identified, andinterrelated by humanbeings for the simple reason that their consciousness is apart from it and canthus apprehend it.It is this “ability of perspective” which is a characteristic of the “neter notof the neteru”: Set.It is this same Setian perspective, this “otherness”, which enables beings withthe Gift of Setto imagine and create in disregard of natural law, or more accurately in various“rearrangements”, as in reshaping the wood of a tree into a table or creatingfantastic works ofart, music, architecture, and literature.In judicious sensitivity and æsthetics such straying from natural law is bothharmless andstimulating. However when humankind seeks to disrupt or destroy the harmony ofthe neteru atits most essential and sublime, the consequences can be truly blasphemous, as inthe haphazarddestabilization of atomic order to produce fission and fusion bombs of dreadfuldestructiveness.In the conceit of “mastering nature”, rash scientists may well find that it iseasier to openforbidden doors than to safely close them.3. Contentment in Plato’s CaveIn his Republic Plato allegorizes a darkened cave in which the ignorant arechained so thatthey cannot see the daylight outside. It is the calling of the true philosopher,admonishes Plato,to unchain these prisoners and enable them to find their way to the light.Where the ordering and enforcement of nature - the super-nature, the neteru -areconcerned, there are two classes of cave-dwellers who don’t see them: atheistsand agnostics.While Setians are under no obligation to unchain them, a few clarifications arein orderconcerning them. By way of mitigation it may be acknowledged that theirattitudes are generallyin rejection of the emotionally vulgar and sadistic God ofJudaism/Christianity/Islam, not themore subtle and sublime neteru of the Egyptians.Atheists maintain that no conscious or intelligent entity exists either “as”nature or, evenmore nonsensibly, “above” it. The OU is a nonconscious, automatic machine,nothing more. Howit came to exist, and why it behaves as it does, are therefore “unanswerablequestions”, to whichit is pointless to expend any time or attention. In support of theirintransigence atheists point tothe complete absence of any actual supernatural discretionary behavior apartfrom mythology.Agnostics consider themselves more reasonable by merely asserting a lack ofevidence oneway or the other: God cannot be proved or disproved, so the only sensible courseis to table thequestion, presumably indefinitely.The omnipresence and enforcement of natural law do in fact establish“supernature”, but ata level of abstraction beyond the capabilities or comprehension of thesecontented cave-dwellers.They may be left to bask undisturbed in their shadow-existence.Ironically conventional religion-adherents do not counter the aversion ofatheists andagnostics by the straightforward proof of the OU order/enforcement phenomenondiscussedabove. It is as though its very obviousness and simplicity blind them to it,like fish unaware ofwater because it is “everywhere”. Instead over the centuries they have advancedclumsy,torturous “proofs”, such as the assumed need for a creator and slavemaster Godas imagined inthe Judæo/Christian Bible. The absence of evidence is expected to be overcome by“faith”, e.g.- 147 -completely unsupported belief and trust in such a proclamation. Faith isantithetical to Setianphilosophy.While atheists and agnostics tend to be unconcerned with what others think, thesamecannot be said for faith-dependent religionists. Ostensibly because relianceupon faith is primafacie ridiculous, the faithful cannot easily endure being the objects of suchridicule. Hence“heretics” must be ignored, silenced, banished, or killed if not converted. Intheocratic culturessuch as the Christian middle ages or modern Islamic totalitarian regimes,torture and executionwere and are not uncommon. In societies wherein conventional churches no longerhave suchpower, lesser prejudice an ostracism substitute.Thus, while Setians may not regard themselves or their philosophy as activelythreateningconventional religion, that is not at all the reciprocal perception, as mostrecently highlighted bythe “Satanic Panic” witch-hunts of the 1980s.E. The Subjective UniverseThe Subjective Universe (SU) is each self-conscious being’s perception of theOU, blendedwith personally-generated overlays, selective impressions, and creativeimagination asinstinctive, indoctrinated, inspired, and/or initiated.Thus not even the most controlled physical scientist can claim to accurately andcompletelysee the OU. What he sees is his filtration and distortion of it through his SU,which he has builtup both consciously and subconsciously from innumerable sources since birth.More creative, artistic, mystical, etc. personalities may let their SUs run evenmore freely, tothe point where the OU is of only occasional and necessary relevance to them. Ifsome suchpersons reach a stage where their SUs have completely replaced the OU, they maybe called“insane”; in this sense “sanity” is a measure of an individual’s suppression ofhis SU withinsocially-sanctioned boundaries.F. Subjective/Objective InteractionOnce the simultaneous and permanent existence of the OU and SU is recognized,much ofthe mystery of human history and behavior is no longer mysterious. It justrequires examinationof each such individual, group, and/or event to identify the applicable OUforces and the variousindividual SUs through which they are being perceived and influenced, bothsubconsciously andconsciously.At the subconscious level, for instance, an individual may assume that everyoneelse “seesthe same reality” that he does, when in fact this is never completely the case.At the conscious level the SU can be both easier and more problematic to handle.Easier tothe extent that the individual is making willful decisions about how much of hisSU he cansuccessfully apply. More problematic insofar as others with their differingsubconscious andconscious SUs may be present and involved.G. Collective Subjective UniversesWhen more than one SU is present and involved in any society or problemsituation, itshould be obvious that no two of them will coincide, both in terms ofsubconscious “realityperception” and conscious values, desires, and actions applied.Hence both human society and human history is most accurately understood asattempts bythe involved humans to reconcile their conflicting SUs into one or morecommunity-approvedCollective SUs (hereafter “CSU”). Sometimes this is possible through peacefulmeans such as- 148 -education, reasoning, or argument. In other instances where conscious SUs aretoo passionate,or when subconscious SUs are too inflexible and intolerant, theindividuals/groups may resort tocoercion - aggressive and intensive indoctrination, conditioning, andreinforcement, along withthe suppression or extermination of the offending “competitors” - to achieve thedesired“reality”.In modern society, unsurprisingly, such coercion and intolerance are invariablyattributedto “the enemy”, domestic outlaws, insurgents, revolutionaries, or other “alien”individuals orgroups. It is assumed, without any need for argument or justification, that thecommunity CSUinto which its members have been conditioned since birth, is not just one amongmany options,but is “reality”. Questioning it thus goes beyond acceptable curiosity to“heresy”, “treason”, or“insanity”.This was most famously caricatured in George Orwell’s novel 1984, in whichfailure toaccept the Party’s CSU not just at the conscious but at the subconscious“reality” level wascondemned as the worst of all possible sins: “thoughtcrime” - correspondinglyrequiring not justpunishment but “curing” by destroying the offender’s ability to see “reality”other than throughthe Party’s CSU.H. The Judæo-Christian SoulJudaism is most significant from a CSU standpoint for its introduction of theconcept of“original sin”, according to which every human begins, lives, and ends his orher life under acurse and condemnation from Judaism’s God. This “greatest of all sins” resultedfrom Adam andEve innocently and ignorantly eating a fruit in the Garden of Eden which gavethem individualSUs: awareness of their freedom to assign meaning and evaluations of goodnessand evilnessaccording to their own intelligence and experience, not God’s. In effect theyhad ceased to benon-conscious components of the OU, and this separation was the “greatest sin”.Implicitly theirOU-separation from their eating of the fruit was also passed along to all oftheir descendants,who similarly inherited the same inescapable sin.Consider the effect this CSU has had upon all of the civilizations in its grip:the entire Jewish,Christian, and Muslim world down through the centuries. Humanity is taught thatit isinherently and inescapably evil, so much so that even the most strenuous ofpurging andpunitive lifestyles, such as monasticism, nunnery, celibacy, etc., are futile.Only through theintercession of divine saviors such as Jesus Christ and Mohammed can a fortunatefew humanshope for even posthumous relief. For everyone else this life is a journey ofmisery followed by aneternity of torture. In its original, pre-Christian “Hell” concept,ancientMesopotamians[including the Hebrews] considered the underworld ( Kur-nu-gi-a or Sheol) as adim, dismalplace in which the once-incarnate soul disintegrated. Hence their approach tolife was fatalisticand pessimistic, with ethics considered in terms of Earthly consequences only.Contrast this with the culture of ancient Egypt, in which there was neither“original” nor“inherited” sin. Each individual was born a blank slate, so to speak, and hadfull discretion topursue an incarnation of virtue or vice, after which, at the entrance to theAfterlife, thedeceased’s heart would be “weighed against a feather” to fairly ascertainwhether pleasure orpenance had been earned.The Judaic soul, unlike anything in Egyptian metaphysics, was thus somethingshameful,reprehensible, and evil. What could families, communities, or nations composedof such flawedand doomed creatures hope to accomplish? If they could not save themselves inthe greatersense, of what value were efforts towards morality, virtue, and other behaviorssupposed toplease if not placate God?- 149 -It wasn’t until the late-17th/early-18th century CE “Enlightenment” thatJudæo-Christianityceased to be regarded as literal truth and became merely a propaganda tool forcontrolling theignorant and superstitious. Thereafter, and to this day, it receives extensivelip service andceremony, but without the intelligentsia or even its own cadre regarding it asanything morethan a fairytale. Neither God nor Jesus nor Satan is regarded as anything morethan aconvenient symbolic myth.It therefore takes some effort to cast oneself back to pre-Enlightenment timeswhen all suchinfluences were held to be quite real indeed, and so the determinants of humanactions. Oncethis is appreciated, the Crusades, religious wars, sect-persecutions, and“heathen” civilizationexterminations are coldly understandable not as aberrations but as theGod-sanctioned norm ofhuman conduct.The Enlightenment relegation of Judæo-Christianity from truth to fiction wasechoed in itsconcept of the soul. Previously the soul had been a real, tangible object offear and self-hatredwithin each human. Now that it was eliminated, society had to develop newdevices to entice orcoerce the dominant CSU. We shall survey these devices as they were introducedand are stillused today, but before doing so, we need to clear away the remaining wreckagefrom the popularnotion of the soul, and return again to Egypt for completeness and clarity.From Webster’s International Dictionary:soul: (1) The immaterial essence or substance, animating principle, or actuatingcause of lifeor of the individual life. (2a) The psychical or spiritual principle in generalshared by or embodiedin individual human beings or all beings having a rational and spiritual nature.(2b) The psychicalor spiritual nature of the universe related to the physical world as the humansoul to the humanbody ...While a superficially-impressive attempt, this definition finally falls back onemptycircularity. What is an “animating principle”, and would the soul not exist ifit did not animateexternalities? What is meant by “psychical” and “spiritual”? As Robert AntonWilson quipped inSchrödinger’s Cat: “Theology was a system for explaining things by coining wordswhich nobodycould understand and pretending that the words meant something.” 55I. The Setian Soul: MindStarHow then can each soul find and see itself, since it is a singularity which eachindividualcannot “get outside of”? This harks back to philosophers such as Descartes, whosought, onemight say Quixotically, to “prove” their conscious existence. “Proof” is ofnecessity external, asdiscussed above, so Descartes’ famous Cogito Ergo Sum (I think, therefore I am)is futile: It isimpossible to describe a “thought” which is not the composite of externalsensory input.No, conceptual thought (Kant’s “pure reason”, Plato’s nœsis, Nietzsche’s“horizon building”)begins from the pure, unsupported apprehension of one’s conscious self as anexistential reality:the ba of ancient Egypt, the psyche of the Greeks, the Golden Flower of the Tao,the soul ofJudæo-Christianity, identifying, in the words of Dr. Raghavan Iyer, “... not theshadowy self orfalse egoity which merely reacts to external stimuli. Rather there is that Eyeof Wisdom in everyperson which in deep sleep is fully awake and which has a translucent awarenessof self-consciousness as pure, primordial light.”Indeed as this “pure, primordial light” is brought fully into focus, none of theabove labelsseems completely adequate or accurate. Some, like Kant’s and Nietzsche’s,address expressionrather than essence. The Egyptian realization of the complete essence wasmultifold: not limited55 Wilson, Robert Anton, Schrödinger’s Cat. New York: Pocket Books, 1979, page#98.[index-150_1.png]- 150 -to the ba. For this discussion, therefore, I propose a fresh term, inspired byDr. Iyer’s sublimedescription above:... being the self-contained, self-sustaining concentration of essence whichexists as the core ofthe conscious mind. This new term not only frees us from the limitations andpreconceptualizations of old labels; it is a constant reminder that the presentexamination is afresh, evolutionary one in which we cannot be content to coast on inaccurate orinadequatemyths or stereotypes.Thus emboldened, therefore, let us return to anamnesis to address the questionof theMindStar’s ability to interact with a temporary physical body while not itselfcontaining anyelement of the OU. [In conventional conversation this is often referred to asthe “mind/bodyproblem”.] The key we bring to this lock is that of fields.J. Fields1. DefinitionWhat exactly is a “field”? When something occurs somewhere in the OU becausesomethingelse happens somewhere else in the OU, by no detectible means by which the causeproduces theeffect, the two events are said to be connected by a “field” [well-knownexamples being gravityand magnetism].Understandably OU scientists don’t like fields. To the extent they remain fieldsin defiance ofall attempts to connect their events, they are inconvenient and annoyingrefutations of one of themost sacred OU cows: the law of cause and effect. Science’s fallback excuse isthat the law mustapply to every field phenomenon too; the medium just hasn’t been discovered yet.Sometimes,even more desperately, scientists hypothesize completely fantastic “missinglinks”, such as“gravitons”, to emulate Robert Anton Wilson’s amusing explanation ofconventional religiousjargon. Leaving both scientists and theologians thrashing about in thisterminological quicksand,let us proceed to a very special type of field: that integral with thehumanbody.2. Life-FieldsThe human body is an electromagnetic machine. As such it both generates and isenvelopedby electromagnetic fields (EMF), controlling everything from heartbeat andrespiration to sleepand female menstrual cycles.To understand the significance of EMFs to the human body, it is first necessaryto appreciatethat each such body is not an inert, static clump of permanent matter. It israther an organiccomplex in a constant state of reorganization and reconstitution. For instance,human liver andserum proteins are replaced every 10 days, and the whole of the proteins in thebody about every160 days. Moreover these protein molecules are extremely complex devices, notmere rawmaterial; not even a single amino acid can be out of place in the replacement.To put it another way, there are about 60 thousand billion cells in the humanbody, and everyday about 500 billion of these die and are replaced and rebuilt.- 151 -Why? One possibility is that these molecules are so complex that they areinherently unstableand thus are continuously deteriorating. The metabolic system, including theliquid-basedtransmission of food and raw material throughout the body, is a raging furnaceof consumptionand regeneration.How does the body know precisely how to recreate each cell and molecule? Itcannot bewithin the object itself, because an object cannot “organize itself”.The answer lies in the existence of an entire layered network of EMFs throughoutand withinthe body, altogether comprising a “master plan” EMF for it. Dr. Harold SaxonBurr, ProfessorEmeritus of Anatomy, Yale School of Medicine, named this the L-Field (for“Life-Field”/LF). 56In the case of the human body, its organizing system cannot be chemical, becausethen thatsystem itself would be subject to the same entropic process. Hence there is moreto a humanbeing than mere chemistry. It requires an organizing field, not merely anaccidentalaccumulation of proteins; thus the notion of “gene randomness” is invalid.3. TelosOrganization inherently requires preconception based upon purpose. Conventionalacademic doctrine is that living beings’ purpose is selectively the result ofenvironmental survivalneeds: Darwinian “natural selection”: There is no inherent purpose to life-formsbeyond passive/reactive survival, avoidance of pain, seeking of pleasure, and instinct toreproduce.Prior to Darwin’s theory of passive natural selection, the French biologist JeanBaptisteLamarck (1744-1829), while not denying such passive evolution, augmented it withwhat hetermed “soft evolution” (in modern parlance “Lamarckism”). According to thistheory,characteristics developed or acquired by a given living being can be inheritedby its progeny, thusadding the element of intentional purpose to evolution.If Lamarckism is allowed to operate according to human intellectual will, ofcourse, then theprinciple of purpose on the individual human scale is established. This in turnsuggests thatthere may be a greater element of purpose above and beyond the individual.While heretical to the Darwinian establishment, such a master-principle ofpurpose wasneither unknown nor repugnant to the ancients, who by the time it had reachedGreece fromEgypt referred to it as telos.Teleology is the doctrine that final causes of phenomena exist. Further thatpurpose anddesign are a part of or are apparent in nature. Further that phenomena are notonly guided bymechanical forces (e.g. passive natural seletion), but also move towards certaingoals of self-realization.The opposite of teleology is mechanism, which describes phenomena in terms ofpriorcauses instead of their presumed destination or fulfillment. [Modern science isthusmechanistic.]The existence of Life-Fields establishes that humanity is teleological, notmechanistic, in itsphysical design and development. The species is not a “random OU accident” juststumblingonward through equally-haphazard “survival of the fittest”. This simple andobvious truth isshattering to mechanistic science, because it inevitably mandates anintelligence establishingand guiding the telos: the Egyptian neteru, Pythagorean/Platonic Forms, or invulgarsimplification “gods/God”.But the scientists’ teleological nightmare gets worse [or better, depending uponone’s point ofview] ...56 Burr, Dr. Harold Saxon, The Fields of Life: Our Links with the Universe. NY:Ballantine Books #23559, 1972.- 152 -4. Thought-FieldsAs it turns out, human thought also has the properties of a field. While Dr.Burr wasconducting his 40 years of research regarding what would eventually emerge asL-Fields, otheracademicians were examining mental activity and discovering that it too does notbehave as a“linear machine” [as, for instance, electronic computers running programs of“artificialintelligence”]. 57 Among these findings:(1) Memory is not localized in the brain, except where it is connected to a veryimmediate, specific, and continuous sensory function (e.g. perception of heat).Destroying select, even major areas of the brain does not have a traceableeffectupon the general memory function; other parts of the brain simply “take over”,andeven appear to be re-learning and re-refining supposedly-excised memories. Ifthesource for such reacquisition is not physical, then it defaults to a fieldphenomenon.(2) Access to memories is also non-linear. One may forget what one had fordinner theprevious evening, while having a crystal-clear recall of information/imagerydecades previously. The process by which memories are so assorted [as it is agrey-scale spectrum, not an either/or action] remains unknown.(3) Memory access is instantaneous, its age or complexity notwithstanding. Thisagainis non-linear, as computers must go through selection/exclusion sequences toanswer memory-questions.(4) As Plato illustrated in the Meno, the underlying basis of all knowledge -the primalbuilding-blocks upon which learning and reasoning depend for their accuracy andcoherence - are inherent to each incarnate intelligence: anamnesis -“recollectiveawareness of the neteru/Forms”. In non-metaphysical terms, humans know“instinctively” whether they are thinking reasonably and with validity. [This isnotthe same thing, obviously, as processing thoughts on the basis of invalidinformation.]Of course much of what humans know as day-to-day thought is [at least assumedas] linear[the precise term being “algorithmic”]. Human brains coast through each daylargely on sensorystimulus/response “autopilot”, about 95% of which is subconscious. If theavalanche of dailysensory data had to be dealt with consciously, anything resembling normal humanactivity wouldbe quite impossible.As with Dr. Burr’s L-Fields, Mr. Russell’s “T-Fields” met with something lessthanthunderous enthusiasm in established/conventional scientific circles. It was badenough for Burrto discover an external and purposeful intelligence behind human OU/bodilyorganization andevolution. It was far worse for the most essential elements of individual humanpresence-of-mind to be completely removed from the physical brain. In this devastatingone/two blow,Darwinian mechanism had been completely exploded, with the terrible spectres of“intelligent57 Dr. Harold Saxon Burr’s L-Field research was summed up in his The Fields ofLife: Our Links with the Universe(NY: Ballantine Books #23559, 1972). The first collection of research extendingthis “fields” concept to thought wasDesign for Destiny by Edward W. Russell (NY: Ballantine Books #23405, 1971).Russell was a former newspaperreporter with an interest in speculative science. While it is admittedlyhypothetical, Russell does a commendableand exhaustive job of identifying and citing both scientific and philosophicalsources.- 153 -design” and a metaphysical “soul” returning [absent Judæo-Christian trappings]from their post-Enlightenment banishment.As these [re]discoveries could not be invalidated or discredited, they met withthe academicestablishment’s fallback response: they were simply and persistently ignored.Except, of course, here.K. Egyptian MindStar EmanationsTo this point we have first cleared away the conventional religious andmaterialistic wreckagefrom the popular concept of the “soul”, and established both the MindStar’smetaphysicalexistence and its means of interaction with the OU brain and body.We are now in a position to identify the elements or “emanations” of theMindStar as theEgyptians apprehended them. This is thus the “core” of this book, but it cannotbeoveremphasized that this is not a mere recitation for the reader’s bemusement.It is a doorway, amap, by which the individual can redirect the power of discretionaryconsciousness to its source,purification, and realization of immortality.Each of the following eight emanations proceeds from the [more] OU-linked to the[more]SU-linked. Predictably this makes the more basic ones that much easier toidentify based ontheir familiar, if subconscious OU-usage. A comparison may be made to Plato’s“pyramid ofthought”, which in his Dialogues he stratified as Eikasia (primitive emotion),Pistis (ordinaryactive/reactive thinking), Dianoia (precise, logical, enlightened thought), andNœsis (intuitionand apprehension of the Ultimate Good ( Agathon).The Egyptian priesthoods knew that each living creature was possessed of severalexistence-emanations above and beyond the metabolic mind/body. All sentient beings possessthe firstfour ( khat, ren, khabit, ab). Beings endowed with the Gift of Set (awareness ofisolate self-consciousness) the next two ( ba, ka) as well as in those of initiatory capacityand attainment thenext one ( sekhem), and in unique instances the ultimate one ( akh).Accordingly each of the following expositions is meant not just as something tobe read, butas a personal application exercise. Upon being alerted to each emanation,redirect your thought“inward” until you find and recognize it in yourself. You may be surprised athow effortless thisis. [As effortless and self-evident, indeed, as all of the “great truths”presented in MindStar, eachof which you find, perhaps to your surprise, that you “know already”. Welcome toanamnesis.] Itis a gateway, a map to your personal Grail Castle. Once you know that it existsand is there to bequested and found, you have only to:Descende, audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges. Kod feci.Descend, audacious traveler, and you will reach the center of the Earth. I didit.Arne Saknussemm, inJules Verne,Journey to the Center of the Earth, 18641. KhatThe body-emanation. The khat is integral with the being’s physical body, and istheoriginal of what later, lesser cultures would represent as the “energy body”,“body of light”,“astral body”, etc. In current field theory it constitutes the life-field of theperson, controlling anddirecting its material counterpart’s organization, regeneration, and span ofexistence. Duringphysical life it is coextensive with its material counterpart. After materialdeath it may remainwith the corpse to serve as a medium for the other emanations, or it may merelylinger near its- 154 -remains. Jungians perceived the khat as the “earthbound” anima, and in theoriental vision ofthe Golden Flower it was known as the kuei:Tao the undivided, Great One, gives rise to two opposite reality principles,Darkness andLight, yin and yang. These are at first thought of only as forces of natureapart from man. Laterthe sexual polarities, and others as well, are derived from them. From yin comesK’un, thereceptive feminine principle; from yang comes Ch’ien, the creative masculineprinciple. From yincomes ming (life); from yang comes hsing (essence).Each individual contains a central monad which, at the moment of conception,splits into lifeand essence ( ming and hsing). These two are super-individual principles and socan be related toeros and logos.In the personal bodily existence of the individual they are represented by twoother polarities,a p’o soul (or anima) and a hun soul (or animus). All during the life of theindividual these two arein conflict, each striving for mastery. At death they separate and go differentways. The animasinks to earth as kuei, a ghost-being. 58It is the khat which is drawn into or activated from within a corpse innecromantic magicalworkings. As the reader may surmise, the khat is also the vehicle for the zombiepractices ofVoodoo. 592. RenThe name-emanation. The Egyptians understood the power of names to identify,define,protect, and empower individuals - most conspicuously in the various names takenby eachpharaoh. Collectively and separately each name affected the very essence of theperson, and thegreatest curse [as also illustrated in literature and film] was to be denied allnames. 60 Externallya name can be used to summon or compel, whether physically incarnate or not. Theneteru alsohave the power and the discretion to give names as well as take them, andthrough such namesto take form and voice.3. KhabitThe shadow-emanation. This is the connection of the still-incarnate khat withthe life-forces of the natural neteru, enabling it to function as the organizing andcontrolling energy (the58 The Secret of the Golden Flower by Richard Wilhelm (Trans) (London: Routledge& Kegan Paul Ltd, 1931. Aclassic of Chinese Taoism describing the process of the attainment oftranscendental existence by the means ofcreating a mandala from the personal subconscious. A key influence in themagical philosophy of Golden DawnRosicrucian W.B. Yeats. Cf. also a more recent translation by Thomas Cleary (SanFrancisco: HarperSan Francisco,1991).59 For details of zombification see Wade E. Davis , The Serpent and the Rainbow(New York: Warner Books, 1987),concerning Haitian Voodoo and actual zombie creation - not by supernaturalmeans, but by the secret use ofpoisons. The book is based upon field research by the author, who holdsundergraduate degrees from HarvardUniversity in Ethnobotany and Biology, and a Ph.D. in Ethnobotany.60 For example, in Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars, the Egyptian priestswho sought to prevent the fearedsorceress-Queen Tera from returning to incarnate life attempted to destroy allinscriptions of her name in her tomb,as well as in other references to her. [They failed.]In H.P. Lovecraft’s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, the name and all referencesto the Colonial sorcererJoseph Curwen were tracked down and obliterated by the vigilantes who murderedhim.Elsewhere in exoteric history it was a common practice for Egyptian pharaohs andpriesthoods to attempt todeface or erase the names, images, and monuments of feared or hatedpredecessors, such as the “heretic”Akhenaten.- 155 -individual “life-field”). If the khabit is destroyed, the life-fieldde-energizes and the physical bodyexpires. In Black Magic the khabit can also be sent out by its owner as aninstrument of influenceupon others.After the physical body is destroyed or no longer needed, the khabit becomes anavatar of theneter Anubis, overseeing guidance of the [noninitiate] consciousness through theincoherence ofthe Tuat into the stabilization of Amenti. An initiated consciousness needs nosuch guidance.4. AbThe heart-emanation. The physical locus of individual identity andconsciousness, hencethe bridge between the OU of the neteru and the SU of the four metaphysicalemanations. It isthrough the ab that an individual realizes and recognizes incarnate identity anduniqueness, andfollowing destruction/expiration of one’s body it is through the ab that one canreenter the OU[as a “ghost”, through “possession” (more precisely merger with another,incarnate ab), orthrough thought-transference].It is also in the ab that the strength and quality of one’s maat (inclination to“good” or “evil”)reposes. This is echoed in the later Indian mythologies of karma, and was thereason for theposthumous “weighing of the heart against a feather” in Egypt. After bodilydeath the maatwithin the ab overwhelms it completely, so that any subsequent manifestation inthe OU is likelyto be an extreme concentration of either beneficence or malevolence.5. BaThe core-emanation. This is each sentient being’s sense of self-awareness, ofunique andabsolute distinction from everything else (both other sentient beings and theentire OU). Thus itis the manifestation, or Gift, of Set, the neter of non-nature, in eachso-conscious entity.The ba becomes stronger through increased self-exploration and -realization: theinitiatoryprocess of Xeper. Unlike natural initiation, which draws the individual intoalignment, harmony,and ultimately conscious absorption into and indistinction from one or more ofthe naturalneteru, Xeper of the ba does not dissolve the self into Set, but attains andsustains a cohesiveessence of its own.The anamnesis or “remembered knowledge” experienced by the slave boy in Plato’sMeno isperhaps more accurately described as the physical-process, stimulus/responsebrain reaching into the ba for bits of its immortal, eternal wisdom. But this is akin to reachingfor a coal in a hotfire. It is stressful to do, and the result can be held only for a fleetingmoment without furtherstress. The superficial/physical “self”, which through material “hits”continuously reassures itselfthat it is the only self, is shaken by exposure to its falseness, itsnothingness. It backs away fromsuch “close encounters”, dismisses them as “illusions”, “fantasy”,“imagination”, etc., andhastens to rebuild its fortress of material-sensation walls.Absent Setian orientation and initiation, a ba simply continues as one’s senseof identity, thusthe “essential self” around which all of the other souls coalesce and recognizethemselves. Withinnoninitiates this results in the ba being sensed as a dreamy, meditative “stateof being” which, ifindulged in with persistence and intensity, leads to its overwhelming the othersouls, hence“nirvana” and similar states of ba-ecstasy.6. KaThe transmigration-emanation. The ka is the complete mirror-image of all eightnaturaland non-natural emanations, fused into an avatar, Doppelgänger, or Horla, acompletely- 156 -metaphysical remanifestation of oneself which can exist and displace withoutlimit, both withinthe non-natural universe generated by one’s ba and within the physical universeof the naturalneteru as well.It is the ka that, through the ab, enters the natural universe through “identitygates” such aspictures or statues of the individual, or utterance of the individual’s name(s)(the ren), as well asthrough conducive locales such as temples and geological & architecturalanomalies.While the ba may, particularly posthumously, lose awareness of itself throughtheparadoxical expansion of that consciousness into its entire perceptive field,the ka remainsimmortally finite, distinct, and otherness-separate. Thus in an expressive,active sense itbecomes the externally-identifiable individual beyond physical death.Nowhere is the ka better illustrated than in initiate Bram Stoker’s The Jewel ofSeven Stars.Film treatments of this work, such as Hammer’s Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb andthe morerecent The Awakening, have done it a grotesque disservice. In Stoker’s originaltext it is in nosense a horror story, but rather a fascinating and romantic mystery: Who wasTera of ancientEgypt, this marvelous sorceress-queen who took with her to her tomb only a rubyscarabinscribed with the constellation of the Thigh of Set (our “Great Bear”) and thehieroglyphs mer(love) and men ab (patience)? Listen to the words of the woman of our own erawith whose kaTera came gently to merge:I can see her in her loneliness and in the silence of her mighty pride, dreamingher own dreamof things far different from those around her. Of some other land, far awayunder the canopy ofthe silent night, lit by the cool, beautiful light of the stars. A land underthat Northern star,whence blew the sweet winds that cooled the feverish desert air. A land ofwholesome greenery,far, far away. Where were no scheming and malignant priesthood; whose ideas wereto lead topower through gloomy temples and more gloomy caverns of the dead, through anendless ritual ofdeath! A land where love was not base, but a divine possession of the soul!Where there might besome one kindred spirit which could speak to hers through mortal lips like herown; whose beingcould merge with hers in a sweet communion of soul to soul, even as theirbreaths could mingle inthe ambient air! I know the feeling, for I have shared it myself. I may speak ofit now, since theblessing has come into my own life. I may speak of it since it enables me tointerpret the feelings,the very longing soul, of that sweet and lovely Queen, so different from hersurroundings, so highabove her time! Whose nature, put into a word, could control the forces of theUnder World; andthe name of whose aspiration, though but graven on a star-lit jewel, couldcommand all thepowers in the Pantheon of the High Gods. And in the realisation of that dreamshe will surely becontent to rest!In Love and Patience we are taught the secret of true immortality - not therepulsivereanimation of corpses ( anastasis nekron) of Christianity, nor the vagueconfusion ofreincarnationists - but the infinite radiance of one’s MindStar by its mostmagnificentexpression, and with a serene transcendence of natural time.The last two souls are unique in that they must arise from the individual, andrequire initiateconsciousness to do so, per the formula Xepera Xeper Xeperu (“I Have Come IntoBeing andCreated That Which Has Come Into Being.”).7. SekhemThe neter-emanation. While the term sekhem is ordinarily translated as “power”,this ismisleading, because it is power in a very rarified sense - that emanating fromthe neteruthemselves. For this reason it is also described as “the power of the stars”through which theneteru manifest in the natural universe. The sekhem combines with the ab (as, ineffect, a temple- 157 -within one’s consciousness), to draw down the essence of one or more adoredneteru to indwelltherein.Activation of the sekhem has another effect: every incidence infuses theInitiate with more ofthe neter invoked, to the cumulative degree that the Initiate’s personalitybecomes accented bythe neter’s: seeing as that neter sees, speaking as that neter would speak,acting as that neterwould act. Hence it is the sekhem which makes possible, and ultimatelyconsecrates priesthoodof a neter in the individual so aligned. Once this transformation has takenplace, it cannot beundone; at most it may be sublimated or repressed, but only at great cost to thepriest’s orpriestess’ very sanity.8. AkhThe star-emanation. Beyond the priesthood of the sekhem is the akh, in which theInitiaterises to the company of the neteru as one of their essence, if not of themabsolutely. Such one isindistinguishable from the actual neteru except by the neteru themselves. Such amode ofexistence departs completely from all concern with physical displacement withinnatural-universal references or boundaries, manifestation, or action, and affectsotherness only by theradiance of its presence. While it does not destroy any of the other emanations,it permeates allof them, such that henceforth they all exist in conformity and concert with it.L. ConsciousnessHaving established and defined the OU/SU environment in which existence occurs,it is nextnecessary to discuss who or what exists to perceive and interact with thisenvironment. Aphenomenon of distinction from that environment is essential, and it must beaware of itself torecognize and appreciate that distinction. It is inherently a function, not athing, traditionallycalled “consciousness”.Consciousness is both easy and difficult to establish - easy because itspresence is obvious:the mere awareness [of self and/or anything else] characteristic of a living,sentient being.Having achieved this realization, the possessors of consciousness have found itsconstitutionmaddeningly elusive.Over the centuries theologians, philosophers, and scientists have sought toportray andadvocate consciousness as something either supporting or refuting the existenceof what is reallytheir concern: the “soul”.1. Metaphysics: Consciousness as an EntitySince conventional theology regards consciousness as “the soul in action”, ithas generallybeen happy to just blur the two concepts into a single, nothing-further-neededaxiom of religiousfaith.Philosophers seeking to escape the label of such mere faith found that themoment theystrayed from the simple act of self-awareness, they were actually addressingother issues, such aswhether physical sensory input is/was occurring, whether such input is reliable,and indeedwhether the mental processing of concepts and information (e.g. “thought”)should somehow beeither a requirement or evidence of awareness. René Descartes’ famous “cogitoergo sum” (= Ithink, therefore I am) is an example of such off-the-mark confusion; argumentsboth pro andcon this maxim have all focused on the act of thinking rather than mereself-awareness.- 158 -2. Physics: Consciousness as an IllusionModern physical science is adamantly materialistic; any hint of a metaphysicalpresence oractivity is tantamount to heresy. If consciousness exists, therefore, it must beexplainable [away]as the physical brain generating some form of illusory self-imagery.In support of this theory, scientists note that if the brain is anæsthetized,the individual“blacks out”. Also when the body and brain sleep, consciousness either blacksout or becomesmerely a spectator to hallucination (e.g. dreaming).Upon examination both of these scientific claims fail to be conclusive. Asordinaryconsciousness is accustomed to being reactive to physical sensory input, thesudden muting of allsuch input by anæsthesia throws the consciousness into a sudden non-sensory modewith whichit has no experience. The result is temporary inactivity, though below the levelof sensoryimagery it continues to receive stimulus signals from the physical body.In certain anæsthesia applications, moreover, the body’s transmissions to theconsciousnessare muted while that consciousness remains alert and communicative. If it weremerely afunction of the body’s normal physical sensory processes, this would not occur.Where sleep and dreaming are concerned, it has already been established that thequality andcoherence of the act of thinking is an entirely different concern thanself-awareness per se.Where ordinary sleep and dreaming are concerned, once again awareness must notbeconfused with thinking. In short, the random imagination characteristic ofdreams, or theabsence of such experiences if the resting brain has so lowered its sensorytransmissions, has norelevance to awareness. Being self-aware does not require this to be continuous.3. InconsequenceThe phenomenon of self-awareness is as a simple incident essential to validatingthedistinction between the individual and the OU. Beyond this, however, it is not acomponent ofeither a “soul” or the physical brain/body which can be used to verify eitherpremise. Indeed inthe search for the “soul” awareness is something of a red herring, beingconfused with thethinking process by agenda-advocates.4. The Platonic “Pyramid of Thought”The concept of an individual’s transcending a “threshold of consciousness” isamong the mostancient of recorded human experience. In various cultures and countries it hasbeen known as“initiation”, “enlightenment”, “illumination”, “awakening”, etc. [This is notthe same thing asbodily “rites of passage” involving puberty/admission to an adult community.Those of coursehappen to all in that community; by contrast only a relative few encounter andconfrontinitiation.]Human consciousness consists of both self-awareness and the sensation ofphenomena thatare “not the self”. At the most base level, these are little more than instinctand stimulus/response. An individual can [and many do] go through an entire physical lifetimein this mode ofdull relaxation. In Book VII of his Republic Plato symbolized this as a “cave”in which ordinaryhumanity is “chained facing the inner wall, on which only faint reflections canbe seen”. Theinitiate (Plato’s “philosopher”) breaks free or is freed by an initiator. Whathe then confronts andexperiences is the challenge, ordeal, and promise of initiation, as summarizedby Raghavan Iyerin his Parapolitics:- 159 -The upward ascent, which involves pain and struggle, will only be valid becauseof anexact correspondence between levels of reality, modes of knowing, and states ofbeing.Who a man is reflects and determines what he really knows, which is connectedwithwhat he regards as real.Man determines what and to what degree things, objects of desire, and valueswill bereal for him. To this extent it is tempting to agree with Protagoras that “manis themeasure of all things”.But as a reality-assigning agent, man is confronted with the philosophicalquestionwhich Protagoras, a sophist and epistemological relativist, did not face: Whatis it aboutthe world of nature that allows the existence of such a reality-assigning agent?There must be a sense in which there is a reality independent of individualmindsand wills. There is also a subtle interplay between the reality that cannot bewhollygrasped by the individual, and his own capacity to make that reality come alivethroughthe self-conscious exercise of his reality-assigning function. He is able togrow in adirection that is in harmony with the whole of nature.If a man truly embodies what is implicit in the ascent from the Cave, he mustrealizethe extent to which time and nature are on his side. He must prevail, but thisidea ofprevailing is much subtler and more elusive than any crude conception ofsurvival orpower.His moral growth is marked by an increase in the intensity and potency of hispower ofthought and ideation. The crucial assumption is that the mind of man, at anystage,is engaged in a mode of participation in planes of awareness divided intoobjects existing in relation to interdependent categories of space, time, andperception.There are four stages of cognition on the “divided line’ [between intellectualandsensory knowledge] that may be viewed in this way.At the lowest level of eikasia are instantaneity and localization, the prison ofthe“here and now”. To be caught up in them is to be so lacking in critical distancefrom agiven setting that nothing else can be seen.This mole-like life is restless, fantasy-ridden, and competitive in the extreme.It isoften characterized through analogies with rodents or insects. At this level ofexistence weengage in activities demeaning to the human status and even abdicate theprivilege ofbeing human.Such analogies usually tend to malign animals, because people cannot do whatanimalsdo with the natural precision of instinct. Nonetheless this stage ofconsciousness is quiterecognizable.Above it lies a second stage, pistis, which is much more dangerous than thefirstbecause it is the realm of pseudo-absolutization. It is characterized byopinions andideologies that are only relatively true and therefore relatively false.The knowledge gained by comparison and contrast is contingent and notnecessarilytrue. Many questions relative to space and time arise. Suppose someone advancestheview that it is human nature to be selfish. One might ask what makes him saythis? Wheredid he pick it up? What does it mean to him? How does he interpret it? Suchquestionsbegin to bring out the relativity of such assertions.Human beings at this stage, however, do not like the relativity of theiropinions to beshown, and tend to convey their assertions without qualification as if they weretotallytrue. They are made to look like immutable maxims, although if they were theywould givestrength and enable individuals or societies to maintain themselves without needofconstant reinforcement. They would not leave people afraid of questions, orunable to- 160 -consider the possibility of other ways of formulating similar truths. Butpseudo-absolutization goes with dogmatism of the most insecure kind, which must bereinforcedfrom outside by polls and by power, by this, that, and the other.In the third stage, dianoia, there are still limitations of space and time, butwith arelative freedom from the “here and now”, and a cleaving to universalgeneralizations ofgiven axioms.The supreme example is mathematics. Yet even the most central axioms inmathematics are conventional, and are based upon apparently arbitraryassumptions.In the third stage the degree of freedom from the relativities of space and timemay besecured at the cost of being unaware of lurking presuppositions which can act asmentalblinders. This problem can be mitigated by critical distance wherein assumptionsserve asaids to further questioning, leading to their step-by-step removal by treatingthem ashypotheses and stairways of ascent until the fourth stage is reached, or atleast sensed.The fourth stage is nœsis, in which there is almost total freedom from theordinarylimitations of space and time.There is a need to be flexible in formulation to progress beyond the thirdstage. Butonce the fourth stage is entered, there is a ready recognition that what is truewithoutqualification can only be incompletely articulated or partially intimated atlesser levels. Itcan be embodied, but only imperfectly. Stenzel has described how “just as in thestrictsense there cannot be an appearance of the Good, so in the end there cannot beopinionabout it; the true Good can never become an object of opinion because it is anunconditional final end”. 61Magister Bruce Ware of the Temple of Set has succinctly summarized Plato’s“Pyramid ofThought” thus:In his quest to define a Philosopher-King, Plato must necessarily define wisdom,and itis this effort of definition that generates the Platonic epistemology consistingof theForms, the four types of cognitive capabilities (also called the faculties, orin Greek“dynameis”) and their fields of objects.For Plato the highest and most fundamental faculty was noesis (sapience); itsfield ofobjects was of the Forms themselves. For humans noesis is “the capacity forknowing” (Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics, 1170a 16). “It is satisfactory to callscience andreasoning ( episteme and dianoia), taken together, knowing ( noesis)” (Plato,Republic533e).Noesis is the full exercise of all the faculties of the reasoning mind. It comesintactfrom the Greek, where it means “thought”, based on the verb noein (to think).The Latinequivalent may be “cogito” or “sapientia”. Note that this word usually istranslated as“intelligence”, but I have determined that the word “sapience” is closer to whatthevarious writers were referring, while “intelligence” seems to have become arather vagueterm in recent years.Dianoia (thinking) is the second faculty, reasoning, especially practicalthought; theLatin equivalent is “ratio” (meaning something closer to “calculation”). Itsfield of objectsis the human mind’s capability of generating conceptual definitions of theForms. Plato:“The converse of the soul with itself, without speech, is what we called thought( dianoia).”In the analogy of the Divided Line, Plato explains the difference between noesisanddianoia:61 Iyer, Raghavan, Parapolitics. New York: Oxford University Press, 1979, pages#43-46.- 161 -But you want to distinguish that part of the real and intelligible which isstudiedby the science ( episteme) of dialectic as having greater clarity than thatstudied bywhat are called “sciences” ( technai). These technai treat their assumptions asfirstprinciples and - though compelled to use dianoia and not sense-perception insurveying their subject matter, because they proceed in their investigationsfromassumptions and not to a first principle - they do not exercise noesis on (thosetechnai), even though with the aid of first principles they are intelligible.And Ithink that you call the habit of mind of geometers and the like “dianoia” butnot“nœsis”, meaning by “dianoia” something midway between doxa (acceptedopinion) and nœsis. (Plato: Republic, VII, 6, 511c-d).Pistis (belief) and eikasia (conjecture = a conclusion arrived at from evidencethat hasgrounds for reasonable belief) have for their fields of objects the individualand particularinstances which manifest the Forms, and imitations or reflections (paintings orsculpturesfor example) of instances manifesting the Forms, respectively. It is veryimportant to noteand remember that these two dynameis are considered by Plato to be cognitiveactivities,activities of the mind, of the philosopher, particularly in this time when ideassurrounding“faith” (implied in “belief” and “conjecture”) are derided as non-rational.Plato describes a process through which one becomes capable of nœsis: first onebegins by contemplating the physical manifestation of the Form Beauty: abeautiful body.Then through dialectical discussion and the full activation and use (“energia”)of all thefaculties, the Philosopher-King candidates finally learn to apprehend the Formof Beautyitself. This is a process, a way of knowing or a way of thinking. Each facultyhas its ownway of knowing, or process of thinking, and thus generates its own way ofbehavior. 62Hence the challenge facing a new initiate is not simply the absorbing andaccumulation ofnew information, but an entirely new way of approaching that information -indeed theawareness and selection from among several new modes of addressing it.5. Ouspensky’s “Psychology of Possible Consciousness Evolution”In 1934 Peter D. Ouspensky, that brilliant student of Gurdjieff, referred tothis sameinitiatory process as “the psychology of man’s possible evolution” andsummarized it in a seriesof five lectures. He began with perhaps the most irritating [to thenoninitiated] question: Whycannot all people become authentic initiates? Why only the Elect few?His answer, blunt in its simplicity: Because most people don’t want it. Theydon’t wantit because it is incomprehensible to them from the outset, it doesn’t promiseanything ofmaterial/tangible value, and finally it is frankly frightening. Ordinary peopleprefer theirthoughts, like their physical lives, to be comfortable, reassuring, predictable,and peaceful. Theydo not want to venture into any kind of “unknown darkness”.Unsurprisingly, and as needs little exemplification here, they also view withmistrust,suspicion, and occasionally outright alarm and hatred those who do so venture.Ouspensky divided human consciousness into four “states”, which he called sleep,wakingsleep, self-consciousness, and objective consciousness:Sleep is the purely passive and automatic state in which the human bodyfunctions [whetherbiologically awake or asleep] without any mental awareness or effort. Inordinary humans this is62 Ware, Bruce, A Survey of Platonic Epistemology. Temple of Set, 2004.- 162 -routinely interrupted and augmented by waking sleep, what most people are whenthey considerthemselves “awake and conscious”. Comments Ouspensky:It is necessary to understand here that the first state of consciousness, thatis, sleep,does not disappear when the second state arrives, that is when man awakes. Sleepremains there, with all its dreams and impressions. Only a more criticalattitude towardsone’s own impressions, more connected thoughts, more disciplined actions becomeaddedto it.Because of the vividness of sense impressions, desires, and feelings -particularly thefeeling of contradiction or impossibility, which is entirely absent in sleep -dreams becomeinvisible exactly as the stars and Moon become invisible in the glare of theSun. But theyare all there, and they often influence all our thoughts, feelings, and actions- sometimeseven more than the actual perceptions of the moment ...The second state is less subjective. Man already distinguishes “I” and “not I”in thesense of his body vs. objects different from his body. And he can to a certainextentorientate among them and know their position and qualities.But it cannot be said that man is “awake” in this state, because he is verystronglyinfluenced by dreams and really lives more in dreams than in fact. All theabsurdities and all the contradictions of people, and of human life in general,becomeexplained when we realize that people live in sleep, do everything in sleep, anddo not know that they are asleep. 63To this point Ouspensky’s “unawakened man” does not advance past Plato’seikasia, since his“waking sleep” is merely a more sensory-aware state of responsive behavior.What happens when Ouspensky’s man “awakes” [through an initiatory school],however, is insomewhat different focus than that of Plato. Plato’s dianoia is characterized byrationalreasoning concerning all phenomena, but Ouspensky first requires man to developa coherentrealization of himself. Only then can he reliably turn his new vision outwardtowards theobjective universe:These two states, sleep and waking sleep, are the only two states ofconsciousness inwhich man lives. Besides them there are two states of consciousness possible forman, butthey become accessible to a man only after a hard and prolonged struggle.These two higher states of consciousness are called self-consciousness andobjectiveconsciousness.We generally think that we possess self-consciousness - that we are conscious ofourselves, or in any case that we can be conscious of ourselves, at any momentwe wish.But in truth “self-consciousness” is a state which we ascribe to ourselveswithout anyright. “Objective consciousness” is a state about which we know nothing.Self-consciousness is a state in which man becomes objective towards himself,andobjective consciousness is a state in which he comes into contact with the real,orobjective, world from which he is now shut off by the senses, dreams, andsubjectivestates of consciousness ...Another definition of the four states of consciousness can be made from thepoint ofview of the possible cognition of truth.63 Ouspensky, Peter, The Psychology of Man’s Possible Evolution. New York:Alfred A. Knopf, 1950, pages #32-33.- 163 -In the first state of consciousness, sleep, we cannot know anything of thetruth. Even ifsome real perceptions or feelings come to us, they become mixed with dreams, andin thestate of sleep we cannot distinguish between dreams and reality.In the second state of consciousness, waking sleep, we can only know relativetruth,and from this comes the term relative consciousness.In the third state of consciousness, self-consciousness, we can know the fulltruthabout ourselves.In the fourth state of consciousness, objective consciousness, we are supposedto beable to know the full truth about everything; we can study “things inthemselves”, “theworld as it is”.This is so far from us that we cannot even think about it in the right way, andwe musttry to understand that even glimpses of objective consciousness can only come inthe fullydeveloped state of self-consciousness.In the state of sleep we can have glimpses of relative consciousness. In thestate ofrelative consciousness we can have glimpses of self-consciousness. But if wewant to havemore prolonged periods of self-consciousness and not merely glimpses, we mustunderstand that they cannot come by themselves, they need will action. Thismeans thatfrequency and duration of moments of self-consciousness depend on thecommand one has over oneself. So it means that consciousness and will arealmost one and the same thing, or in any case aspects of the same thing. 64M. MindStar and Body InteractionThe general key which the Temple of Set applies to this problem is what EricHoffer refersto as “the unnaturalness of human nature”. The MindStar or self does not behaveas though itwere merely a “sum total” of the brain’s sensory and manipulative capacities,combining andrecombining inputted information as though it were an “organic” electroniccomputer. It has asense of identity, a sense of uniqueness, a sense of distance anddifferentiation from everythingelse that exists. It has characteristics which are something more thaninstinctive and somethingless than logical; these are called “emotions”.Most significantly, perhaps, are the creative MindStar’s thought prerogativesanddispositions. We don’t just think to survive or to react to external stimuli,B.F. Skinnernotwithstanding. We think creatively, spontaneously, abstractly, andæsthetically. We conceive,design, and construct non-natural concepts, arguments, processes, and objects.And we candistinguish between the natural and the non-natural - something that would be alogicalimpossibility if the consciousness itself could not extend beyond the natural.To demonstrate this capacity to yourself, consider something as simple as aMöbius strip.Your consciousness rebels at a phenomenon which it perceives as “against thelaw”. As a matterof fact, the various Möbius phenomena are not “against the law”; there is anentire field ofmathematics - topology - which is concerned with the properties of geometricconfigurationssubjected to various transformations. But here it is not the phenomenon itselfbut rather yourreaction to it which is significant. The revulsion you feel is a manifestationof something in youwhich possesses the power to view the order of the OU from outside.The philosopher Immanuel Kant approached this power of the MindStar from asomewhatdifferent angle. He referred to it as humanity’s ability to assign meaning tonaturalphenomena - to recognize, appreciate, define, categorize, rank, and otherwisedetermine theimportance, relevance, and significance of an event or object in nature.“Objects of experience,”64 Ibid., pages #35-36.- 164 -he said, “are never given in themselves, but only in experience, and have noexistence outsideit.”Arthur Schopenhauer went a step further, holding that the individual will is thesource ofcausality itself, of which space, substance and time are mere derivations.Friedrich Nietzsche discussed the power in terms of the higher intellect’sability to buildhorizons for itself beyond mere recombinations of the known. Plato defined thissuprarationalquality of the mind as nœsis and held that it was capable of perceiving theeternal, transcendentprinciples of all existence beyond even the most rigorous reasoning ( dianoia):the Forms orFirst Principles.This power of the soul is thus both apprehensive [reaching beyond the limits ofthe OU]and creative [enabling one to generate meaning, to initiate existence]. Thiscreative aspect maybe called the Subjective Universe (SU) to distinguish it from the OU.The SU and the OU contain mutually-incompatible elements of definition, but theyalsoblend into one another. For example, we use the SU to assign meaning to the OU,and weregularly rely upon our knowledge of phenomena in the OU to give us “buildingblocks” toconstruct objects in the SU. [Many “fantasy creatures”, for example, can bebroken down into“parts” of natural animals.]The ability of any intellect to generate and operate the SU is not automatic[beyond the levelof ordinary imagination]. It must be deliberately learned and exercised. Theexperience of suchperspective and power can be exhilarating and stimulating; more often - to thoseunprepared forthe sensation and psychologically unable to accept it - it has been frightening.Man does not like the idea that he doesn’t fit wholly and completely into thenatural schemeof things. Hence he has sought an ally in a personalized “God” that created himas a whollynatural pet project [for example, pre-“fallen” man in the Garden of Eden]. Hehas inventedreligious and social codes that give him a sense of conforming to the naturalorder of the OU. Hehas built cathedrals and monuments to reassure and reinforce this sense, and hehas even hadhis dead body buried with rites commemorating his inclusion in it. These veryacts, ironically,expose his secret dread that his conscious self - his MindStar - does not belongto it. When thatpart of him which does belong to it - his physical brain and body - separatesfrom hisconsciousness and remains purely a component of the OU [through physical death],he fears thathis consciousness, unlike his physical shell, will not obey the [OU] law ofconservation of matterand energy. Rather it will cease to exist.While fearing the death of his self-consciousness, ironically, man has alsosought to punishit for its existence. He has mythologized it as devils or, in WesternJudæo/Christianity, the Devil.He has tried to drive it out of his mind through psychological coercion as wellas throughphysical punishment ranging from simple fasting to the tortures of theInquisition. And of coursehe has tried to pretend that it is really not there at all - that any activityby the MindStar which isnot harmonious with the OU is simply disease: madness and mental illness.Nonetheless the soul endures. It has survived all efforts to destroy, distort,disguise, orsublimate it - for none of these efforts has ever actually succeeded in touchingit. At most theyhave succeeded in damaging only the physical medium for its expression.N. Immortality of the MindStarPerhaps the most important contribution of the original Church of Satan(1966-1975CE)was its focus upon and glorification of the soul or psyche, even though itsoriginal ambition wasto downplay that concept in favor of mere fleshly gratification.As we Satanists explored the implications of Anton LaVey’s initial, dramaticstatements inthe Satanic Bible, it gradually became evident that any focus upon oneselfpresupposes the- 165 -separateness of that self from everything else. Flesh is found to consist ofnatural substances,and most of our lower-level thought processes - what Plato would class as pistisand eikasia - aresimilarly found to be little more than conditioned responses to externalstimuli. As the Satanistcontinued his search for the “thing that was exclusively himself”, he was forcedto increasinglymore complex introspection, resulting ultimately in a philosophical andmetaphysical crisis thatwould only be resolved in the more precise philosophy of the Temple of Set.In the Temple the psyche became the acknowledged focus of the Setian’sinitiatory quest.The logical mind and the fleshly body were not disdained, but seen rather asinterpretative andcommunicative devices both between the psyche and its existence in the OU, andbetweenvarious psyches (i.e. between individual Initiates). Subsequently this led theinitiated psyche toconfront the implications of an existence which is radically distinct from theOU. The existenceof the psyche as something not the product of natural forces - created andenergized by Set -necessitates comprehension of its future beyond finite interface with thenatural/material.Historically the issue of the psyche has been gradually oversimplified into a“this-life-only” (TLO) vs. a “life-after-death” (LAD) debate. As the debate has ragedthroughout many agesand mythologies, these two alternatives have tended to become mutuallyexclusive.The TLO proponents have passionately denied that anything of “this life” cancontinue pastthe destruction of the fleshly shell, even though they have no positive proof ofthe simultaneousextermination of the psyche. Since they can no longer detect its presencethrough their ownfleshly interfaces with the OU (the five senses), they presume that it no longerexists. Whenchallenged on this over-extension of logic, they retort that the burden of proofis on thechallenger ... to prove that a posthumous psyche exists by establishing amaterial/5-sensorychannel of communication with it.Most publicized efforts to do exactly that have been predictably ludicrous atbest andfraudulent at worst: seances, reincarnation fantasies, and “ascended master”rubbish.Materialists have felt secure in ridiculing such antics, and one cannot entirelyblame them forclaiming that their own position has thus been validated by default. But bystrict scientific andlogical criteria it has not.At the other extreme are the LAD advocates. They have faced the interestingproblem oftrying to make a convincing and attractive case for something whose existencethey cannotdemonstrate to any of the five OU senses. Rather than address that challengedirectly [as theTemple of Set does], they take the easy way out and sell their product byattacking the TLOcompetition. They portray “this life” as merely a test of obedience, on whichthe individual willbe judged at the point of transition into LAD - which they hold to be far moreimportant becauseit is eternal.Since uninitiated humans fear the unknown and prefer to be safe rather thansorry, theLAD merchants have been able to use fear and threats as effective propagandadevices. Althoughthey are in effect “selling a totally undetectable and unverifiable product” forthe greatest pricethe customer can conceivably pay (a lifelong abstinence from various pleasures)they have beengenerally successful - as is attested to by the unbroken grip of LAD religions,from Osirianism toChristianity, on the bulk of humanity throughout its recorded history.1. Jewish and Christian AfterlifesWithin the Western cultural tradition it is rarely realized that its two majorreligions -Christianity and Judaism - are actually at extremes apart on this issue.Christianity in all of itsmany forms upholds LAD as reason for abstinence in “this life”. Judaism, on theother hand,insists upon TLO and absolutely rejects justification for human behavior on anygrounds other- 166 -than YHVH’s direct instructions to living humans. Comments Arthur Schopenhauerin Parega#I, 13:The Jewish religion proper, as described and taught in Genesis and all thehistoric books untilthe end of Chronicles, is the crudest of all religions because it is the onlyone which has no theoryof immortality - not even a trace of it. Every king and every hero or prophet isburied, when hedies, with his fathers, and there is an end of the matter; no trace of anyexistence after death;indeed, as if intentionally, every thought of this sort seems to have beenremoved.Schopenhauer is only partially correct. The ancient Hebrews drew no distinctionbetweenhuman souls and the animating force common to all animals ( nephesh). Althoughsome part ofthis animating force was thought to survive the destruction of the body, it wasregarded withsuperstitious terror and referred to ambiguously by the terms elohim andrephaim. By the 2ndcentury BCE Hebrew doctrine had changed to include the revivification of thematerial body, butHebrew theologians never extended this principle to the Pythagorean/Platonicconcept of anindependently-surviving psyche.Not surprisingly the original Christians continued this Jewish tradition ofcorporealrevivification, using the Greek term psyche to mean much the same thing as theHebrewnephesh. In Matthew 10:28, where the soul is mentioned as distinct from thebody, theirposthumous reunion is promptly suggested. The most conclusive example of thisdoctrine, ofcourse, is that of Jesus’ own material resurrection [as in Luke 24:36-43], butby the time of Paulthe distaste with which sophisticated Greeks regarded this “animation ofcorpses” ( anastasisnekron) induced that apostle to modify Christian teachings in the direction ofPythagoreanism.Paul was further aware of - and presumably sought to overcome - the challenge ofGnostic andHermetic Christianity, being a blend of basic Christianity with various Egyptianand Hellenicmysteries. 65In I Cor. 15:35 and II Cor. 5:1-2 Paul offers a mixture of Pythagorean andHebrew ideas,whereby the posthumous soul is given a “spiritual body” ( soma pneumatikon)whichnevertheless requires a bodily form. Despite Paul’s efforts, Christianity hasnever succeeded inbreaking free from the notion of reanimation of the original corpse, which atleast has been gristfor the mill of horror-film producers.While there have been many explanations for Christian antipathy towards Judaism,one ofthe most crucial had todo with Jews’ failure to be posthumously accountable inany way for theirincarnate conduct, implying that they are self-serving and indifferent toethics. ObservedDietrich Eckart, initiate of the Thule Gesellschaft and mentor to Adolf Hitlerand AlfredRosenberg, in 1919 ( Auf gut deutsch):It is now evident that a people which completely denies the existence of lifeafter death mustlimit all of its thoughts and endeavors to the present world, to earthlyexistence; it has no otherchoice. But a people can only grow up with such an emphasis on worldly mattersif itfundamentally lacks any need for immortality, which in turn is possible only ifthere is no trace offeeling in its basic character for the eternal in mankind. Wherever the soulmanifests itself, nomatter how faintly, a sense of immortality necessarily follows. The individualis not alwaysconsciously aware of this; indeed there are many who refuse to understand it -who are soignorant concerning the concept of immortality that they habitually denounce it,even while theirunselfish actions clearly reveal that each one of them senses the soul andtherefore eternity withinhimself.65 The 1945 discovery of thirteen original Gnostic codices at Nag Hammadi inUpper Egypt has shed much light onthe ideas with which Paul had to compete. The codices themselves date to 350-400CE but are probably copies of2nd century CE originals.- 167 -Although Pauline Christianity attempted to appropriate the Pythagorean/Platonicconcept ofthe “soul distinct within and ultimately freed from the body”, it was unable tosustain thisconcept without the vehicle of the body. Christian artistic representations ofposthumousParadise are invariably sterile and dull. It will be recalled that Christ’sultimate promise upon hisSecond Coming was to reunite all souls with their ex-bodies, so that they wouldonce again enjoytheir original corporeal shells.2. Beyond Judæo-ChristianityThe Christian concept of “Satan”, being as it was a crude scarecrow ofeverythingChristianity didn’t like, was thus as “confused in reverse” as Christianityitself was. This is clearlyevident in Anton LaVey’s Satanic Bible, wherein Satan is said to stand forindulgence in fleshlylife and rejection of posthumous judgment. As Anton plagiarized from RagnarRedbeard’s Mightis Right:Life is the great indulgence - death the great abstinence. Therefore make themost of life -here and now! There is no Heaven of glory bright and no Hell where sinnersroast. Here andnow is our day of torment! Here and now is our day of joy!Viewed in this context, the Church of Satan’s initial Satanism was, in effect,Judaism with aYHVH who would let you do anything you wanted rather than one who was a vengefulsadist. Yetboth systems - the nice (Satanic) one and the vicious (Jewish) one - came to ascreeching halt atthe grave. [Anton explained the many memento mori decorations of his home asreminders ofdeath’s being just around the corner, hence of the need for Satanists to get asmuch out ofincarnate life as possible.]Elsewhere in the Satanic Bible, however, Anton made a statement which, whilelargelyoverlooked during the Church of Satan’s span of existence, is one of the morecrucial in his entirephilosophy:If a person has been vital throughout his life and has fought to the end for hisearthlyexistence, it is this ego which will refuse to die, even after the expiration ofthe flesh whichhoused it ... It is this vitality that will allow the Satanist to peek throughthe curtain ofdarkness and death and remain earthbound.Here Anton’s concept of life was still the TLO one common to Judaism and hisoriginalSatanism. In wishing to live rather than die, he could conceptualize immortalityonly in terms ofan extension of TLO through force of will. He likened it to the refusal of achild to go to bedwhen there is something exciting going on; in this sense it was a denial thatthere could be anykind of life for the psyche other than “earthbound life”. To “go to bed” is notto move intoanother mode of existence, but simply to cease to exist. Anton’s originalSatanism thus combineda “friendly YHVH” (Satan) with the promise of endless material existence for thepsyche -providing that the psyche could project the strength and coherence of willnecessary for thatexistence.As discussed at length in my Church of Satan history, Anton LaVey and the Churchof Satanwere never able to resolve the dilemma of Satan’s actual existence: Was he realor just symbolic?If he were real, it would seem to open the door to the entire Christian conceptof the universe.If on the other hand he were merely symbolic, then he didn’t really exist as aself-conscious,willful force which could actualize Satanists’ ritual-magical desires or whichcould even careabout the existence of the Church of Satan. In that case magic would be reducedto mere stage-trickery, and the Church itself would be nothing more than a club for spookypsychodrama.- 168 -The Temple of Set resolved this dilemma in 1975 CE by asserting the actualexistence of“Satan” (as Set - the original, pre-Judæo/Christian entity) while at the sametime removing theconcept of his existence entirely from the Judæo/Christian tug-of-war.The essence of the psyche, stated Set in the Book of Coming Forth by Night, issuch that itsexistence is neither dependent upon the material nor imprisoned in it fortesting or task-fulfilling purposes. Rather the physical body provides a vehicle in which thepsyche can becomeaware of itself and then reach out towards the limitlessness of its consciousexistence. [It is this process which the Temple defines by the hieroglyphic termXeper.] “Thislife” may be likened to a springboard or launching-pad towards the psyche’sultimate Self-awareness and state of Being.As for Set, he neither cracks a whip over humans in TLO nor sits in judgmentover them inLAD. Rather he is understood as the source of the potential for Xeper in eachhuman animal.Whether or not each individual recognizes this potential and takes steps todevelop it (what wemean by “initiation”) is not Set’s prerogative, else his own psyche would simplydisplace the onewithin each self-aware human.Such illuminated awareness is eloquently articulated in Her-Bak as one of thecentralsecrets of the ancient Egyptian Priesthoods:What is life? It is a form of the divine presence. It is the power, immanent increatedthings, to change themselves by successive destructions of form until the spiritor activatingforce of the original life-stream is freed. This power resides in the verynature of things.Successive destruction of forms, metamorphoses, by the divine fire with rebirthof forms newand living is an expression of consciousness. It is the spiritual aim of allhuman life to attain astate of consciousness that is independent of bodily circumstance.What I have just said concerns the living spirit bestowed on the man alreadyquickened,like every living thing, by a rudimentary soul, which makes of such a man acreature superiorto the animal-human kingdom. He who recognizes the divine meaning of life knowsthatknowledge has but one aim, which is to achieve the successive stages thatliberate him fromthe perishable. For things die only in their body; the spirit, the divine Word,returns to itssource and dies not. Unhappy is the Ka that fails to recover its soul. 66Such an explanation generally represents the perspective of the OU priesthoods,whichsought to interpret and explain humanity within that envelope. They were forcedtoconceptualize incarnate humanity as a temporary particularization of the generalOU, each suchhuman uncomfortably aware of this tension and striving to eliminate it throughre-absorptioninto the OU. While this Sage suggests that this is done by successive,progressively-more-refinedincarnations (a general premise of reincarnationism), there is little inoriginal Egyptianmetaphysics to support this. 67Had Her-Bak’s initiation been into the Priesthood of Set rather than that ofIsis, he wouldpresumably have been answered much in the vein of this book; but that would havenecessitateda far different exposure to the OU reality surrounding him than he received.Repeatedly andremorselessly his complete separateness would have been dramatized to him,removing thereassuring and relaxing prospect of both incarnate and disincarnateOU-inclusion.66 Schwaller de Lubicz, Isha, Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate. New York: InnerTraditions, 1967, page #35.67 In Secrets of the Great Pyramid Peter Tompkins has suggested that a crucialrationale of Egyptianmummification was precisely to prevent further terrestrial reincarnation.Permanent preservation of the body gavethe more material emanations the anchor they needed until the multifacetedMindStar could fully integrate itself ina completely independent environment.- 169 -Thus Setian initiation exposes and incites a crisis in the initiate whichinitiation through theother, natural neteru avoids. This crisis is definitive and exhilarating to theSetian mentality, butcan be devastating to one of the other neteru. As starkly summarized by H.P.Lovecraft:Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it peerdæmoniacalhints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous. Science,already oppressivewith its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of ourhuman species -- ifseparate species we be -- for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never beborne by mortalbrains if loosed upon the world. 68As we have seen, conventional visions of post-incarnate immortality tend to theOU-totalitymodel, fumbling between either immediate OU-reabsorption or some sequence ofprogressive orkarma-varying terrestrial reincarnation. In the absence of a non-natural telos,humanity isforced into either free-will or deterministic OU-Mechanism. Envisioningimmortality withinsuch constraints leads to only one result: dissolution of the self, theindependent consciousness.To the OU-initiate this is indeed expected and even anticipated, often with theassumptionthat one’s personality will not in fact be extinguished, but rather melded intothat of thecollective gods/God. Such an outcome would indeed relieve the tension andexclusiveness ofseparateness; it is less comprehensible how it would permit any vestige of thepreviously-individual life-being to continue.In his book Life After Death, the eminent philosopher Maurice Maeterlinckaddressed hisperceived reliance upon bodily definition of self:I care not if the loftiest, the freest, the fairest portions of my mind beeternally living andradiant in the supreme gladness; they are no longer mine; I do not know them.Death has cut thenetwork of nerves or memories that connected them with I know not what centerswherein lies thepoint which I feel to be my very self. They are thus set loose, floating inspace and time; and theirfate is as alien to me as that of the most distant stars.Yet Maeterlinck is not so certain that the physical body’s materials andmechanisms are thewhole story. He senses that the entirety of himself is more than the sum of suchtangible physicalparts, and indeed may be completely apart and distinct from them, using themonly as an OU-interactive device. He continues:All that befalls has no existence for me unless I can recall it within thatmysterious beingwhich is I know not where and precisely nowhere and which I turn like a mirrorabout this worldwhose phenomena take shape only insofar as they are reflected in it. 69Maeterlinck used the term “ego” [in a non-Freudian sense] to refer to thisindividual identitysomewhere/somehow beyond the purely physical, in which he defined “mind” asphysically-driven brain functioning:This ego, as we conceive it when we reflect upon the consequences of itsdestruction - this ego,therefore, is neither our mind nor our body, since we recognize that both arewaves that roll byand are incessantly renewed. Is it an immovable point, which could not be formor substance, forthese are always in evolution, nor yet life, which is the cause or effect ofform and substance?In truth it is impossible for us either to apprehend or define it, or even tosay where it dwells.When we try to go back to its last source, we find little more than a successionof memories, amass of ideas, confused, for that matter, and unsettled, all connected with thesame instinct, the68 Lovecraft, H.P., “Arthur Jermyn” in Dagon and Other Macabre Tales. Sauk City:Arkham House, 1965, page #47.69 Maeterlinck, Maurice, Our Eternity. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1914, pages #50-51.- 170 -instinct of living: a mass of habits of our sensibility and of conscious orunconscious reactionsagainst the surrounding phenomena.When all is said, the most steadfast point of that nebula is our memory, whichseems, on theother hand, to be a somewhat external, a somewhat accessory faculty and, in anycase, one of thefrailest faculties of our brain, one of those which disappear the most promptlyat the leastdisturbance of our health. As an English poet has very truly said, “That whichcries aloud foreternity is the very part of me that will perish.” 70Maeterlinck was, however, falling into - or, rather, setting for himself - thesame logical trapthat imprisons contemporary Mechanists: that memory is completely a product andconstruct ofOU interactions through the physical senses. Eliminating them eliminates it.Implicit in this limitation is the assumption that OU-based, and presumablybuttressed,memory is the only “real” memory. Anything else is merely imaginative, and assuch must bekept carefully and strictly segregated from the “real”. If the two are confused,or worse yetdeliberately dignified with the same reality, the individual is “insane”.The same holds true for time-assignments of memory events. If one remembers anevent, itmay or may not be consciously or subconsciously dated. Remembering your datefrom your highschool prom associates that OU date with the memory creation. But rememberingsomething notso inherently fixed in time, such as a favorite location visited repeatedly overyears, does notcarry a specific date. You may store enough short-term memory to be certain youhaven’t seen itwithin the last year or so, but that is merely external-exclusionary.Also there is no reliable division in terms of precision between short-term andlong-termmemory. It’s effortless to remember the multiplication table you learned in thethird grade.Yesterday’s credit-card charge at the supermarket? Not unless you gave itspecial “retentive”attention at the time.All of which is to say that memory is neither objective nor reliable, and thatthere is nocertain mechanism to ensure or correct either problem.With Maeterlinck’s trust in memory-as-self undercut, the individual is reducedtoinstantaneous sensation of separateness to establish conscious identity. This isRené Descartes’cogito ergo sum at its most fundamental. It is not thinking “of something”,whether real orimaginary, that establishes individual consciousness; it is the exercise ofthinking itself. 71But confirming that one exists is only the smile of the Cheshire Cat. Whatdistinguishes anddifferentiates you from innumerable other separate consciousnesses? Again theMechanist’shabit is to default to his OU body. “I am what exists within and uses thismachine.” Nevertheless,as we have already seen, this is not at all a unitary relationship. Parts of thebody can beinactivated or removed without affecting the wholeness of consciousness, andduring sleep oranesthesia the consciousness disconnects from all of the body’s physical-senseinterfaces.We are left with an “essential self” which we thought we knew through a mixtureof reliablememories and constantly-reinforcing body sensations. We now realize that botharefragmentary, imperfect, unreliable illusions. This wisdom survived thedestruction of ancientKhem as the Pythagorean/Platonic doctrine of transmigration of the psyche asevidenced byanamnesis:70 Ibid., pages #48-49.71 Rejecting the “disincarnate origin” of thinking as establishment of personalexistence and identity, MartinHeidegger proposed that self-perception requires external displacement: “beingthere” ( Dasein) in order tosubsequently conceive itself through a composite of “what it isn’t” reflections.This may console those unnerved byDescartes, but ultimately does not refute him. Something with the innatecapacity to perceive must preexist anyexternal input.- 171 -SOCRATES: Those who tell it are priests and priestess of the sort who make ittheirbusiness to be able to account for the functions which they perform. Pindarspeaks of it too,and many another of the poets who are divinely inspired. What they say is this -see whetheryou think they are speaking the truth. They say that the soul of man isimmortal. At one time itcomes to an end - that which is called death - and at another is born again, butis never finallyexterminated. On these grounds a man must live all his days as righteously aspossible. Forthose from whomPersephone receives acquittal for ancient doom,In the ninth year she restores againTheir souls to the Sun above.From whom rise noble kingsAnd the swift in strength, greatest in wisdom,And for the rest of timeThey are called heroes and sanctified by men.Thus the soul, since it is immortal and has been born many times, and has seenall thingsboth here and in the other world, has learned everything that is. So we need notbe surprised ifit can recall the knowledge of virtue or anything else which, as we see, it oncepossessed. Allnature is akin, and the soul has learned everything, so that when a man hasrecalled a singlepiece of knowledge - “learned” it, in ordinary language - there is no reason whyhe should notfind out the rest, if he keeps a stout heart and does not grow weary of thesearch, for seekingand learning are in fact nothing but recollection.- Plato, The MenoWhen most people think about “immortality”, they imagine a simple continuationof theirimmediate, conscious perceptions and impressions. That is, the moment-to-moment“reinforcements” that we all experience daily, and which - by being “notourselves” -continuously form a kind of propping-up wall enclosing (hence “defining”) thatamorphousfeeling we are accustomed to calling “ourself”.It is this “self” that most people fear to lose in the event of bodily death.They simply don’tknow how else they could know themselves to exist. Take away the reinforcing“hits” from theOU, and the “amorphous feeling” evaporates into nothingness, they fear, likegoing under ageneral anesthetic (which also, but temporarily, “removes all hits”).The Initiate, however, is challenged to first recognize, then differentiate,then identify hisimmortal consciousness with those parts of the eightfold soul which are neverconnected to thephysical body’s functions, hence are not affected by its death ordisintegration.This is accomplished through reflective, non-reactive thinking. Thus theindividualbecomes aware of his authentic self (soul); and upon activating this as thelocus of hisconsciousness, looks outward at phenomena at the same depth. In other words, thesuperficial“self” looks out at its level and sees OU events - like bodily pleasure/pain,blue sky, ringingtelephones, time defined by clocks and calendars, and so forth. The core or trueself, however,exists as a neter and, when looking outward, sees a SU not of the works of otherneteru, but ofthose neteru themselves. One “machine” sees other “machinery”; one“creator/operator” seesother “creator/operators”.The Egyptians might describe such inward, reflective thinking as the accessingof the ba orcore-soul by the khat or body-soul: the Platonic phenomenon of anamnesis as thekhat, whichnormally exists and defines itself in an environment of bodily dimensions andsensations, notonly reaches beyond that environment but in some situations depends upon the bafor a moreaccurate source of truth. To “deny one’s senses” is a familiar experience formost people incertain situations, though they may not realize what such a gesture actuallyentails in terms ofmental coherence. When done, it is almost always brief and minimal, because thekhat’s reliance- 172 -upon bodily senses for its information and both definition and continuousreinforcement of“reality” is so strong and ingrained. Unless the khat-ba connection is both aconscious and astrong one, the individual may interpret such an experience as mere loss ofcoherence, or“insanity”.Immortality of the self is. Your ability to align your consciousness with yourneter, ratherthan your superficial, animal, illusion of “self” is Xeper.These ancient initiatory keys to immortality were energetically attacked andsuppressed byChristianity, as that cruel religion correctly perceived that fear of death wasone of the mostpowerful weapons it could use to enslave humanity. It was important that deathbe taught assomething hideous and final, from which the only escape was surrender to Christ- by which, ofcourse, Christian churches really meant their institutions. Those areas ofnon-Christian Europewhich had escaped, at least for a time, domination by this numbing propaganda,continued topreserve the truth. In For Freedom Destined Dr. Franz Winkler observes:In ancient times the secrets of man’s true nature, and of the forces thatdetermine his fate,were contemplated in the great temple universities of paganism all over thecivilized world.Though men were fully aware of the important role that heredity plays in theshaping of thephysiological and psychological organism of a human being, they did not thinkthat theinnermost core of the human being was the product of purely biological forces.This innermostcore, called by the Greeks the entelechy or dæmon of man, was credited withqualities uniqueto the individual, apart from the characteristics of the body he inhabited. Theconcept ofentelechy corresponded roughly with the Judæo-Christian concept of an immortalsoul.Most pagan creeds held that the human entelechy neither begins nor ends withlife onEarth. Man’s ‘mortality’ referred merely to the fact that his self-awarenessceased with thedeath of his body. The immortal gods differed from mortal man by thecontinuation of theirconsciousness. Since ancient ideas on the mystery of birth cannot be separatedfrom paganphilosophies about the soul’s supersensible existence, certain conceptsgenerally accepted inthe pre-Christian era should be mentioned. According to pagan theology,consciousness afterdeath could reach one of three levels. The first level was the one allotted tothe average man:dreamlike, with almost complete absence of memory and self-identification,called Hades inGreek, Hel in Germanic mythology. The second was accessible to the true hero,the man whosedeeds of courage and creativeness distinguished him from ordinary mortals. TheGreeks calledthis state of consciousness the Elysian Fields, the Germans Walhalla. The thirdlevel wasreached by those who could soar beyond the narrow limits of Earth-boundconsciousness andthus bring new impulses into the world. Already while they still lived in amortal body, theirawareness had assumed divine status. Their souls after death, in the language ofmythology,were lifted to the stars. 72Is attainment of the immortality of the Ba or psyche a technique which theindividual has to“learn”? Must one hurry to do so, lest one’s body expire before the trick ismastered? Quite thecontrary, as the sage in Her-Bak emphasized, this immortality is innate in allconsciousbeings. You have it already, by evidence of that same consciousness whichenables you to readand comprehend these words. It is nothing which the Temple of Set “confers” onyou; rather it issomething which conventional churches have tried to trick you out of, and whichmaterialisticscience has denied simply because it is an aspect of existence which transcendsscience [henceis not subject to “scientific proof”]. Further from Winkler:Life’s appearance as “meaningless” stems basically from man’s materialisticconcept ofhimself. If his innermost nature were merely biological, complete fulfillment ofhis appetitesand the acquiring of wealth would satisfy his longing for happiness. Since theydo not, an72 Winkler, Franz E., For Freedom Destined: Mysteries of Man’s Evolution in theMythology of Wager’s RingOperas and Parsifal. Garden City, NY: Waldorf Press, 1974, pages #54-5.- 173 -atmosphere of hopelessness is enveloping our generation, especially our youth.In an affluentsociety where all material ways out of such frustration have been found wanting,drugs,perversions, and the thrills of crime are now being used as desperate means ofescape from theintolerable boredom. Well-meaning efforts on the part of the authorities to stemthe tidal waveof juvenile delinquency and drug-addiction will therefore bring scant results,until thefollowing simple truth has been fully accepted by parents and teachers:Happiness, love, and compassion are spiritual faculties that during centuries ofneglectand misunderstanding have withered and grown weak. Unless they are nursed backto health,man will despair of life and eventually throw it away in a mass suicide bynuclear destruction.But how can we care for what we no longer comprehend? Modern science, admirablein itsachievements on a material plane, has proven ineffectual in the understanding ofintangiblevalues. This limitation, while freely admitted by the small number of trulycreative scientists,seems to elude the average intellectual. And the failure to recognize thislimitation adds to thedelusion that natural science in its present form can be the judge of religiousor spiritual truth.Making modern man’s plight even more serious is the fact that his materialisticdelusion ofhimself not only deprives him of wisdom and happiness, but acts also as apattern in whosedreary image he tends to reshape his nature. Consequently more and morepersonalitiesemerge who think and act virtually like robots. They know no happiness and havenoperception of objective morality.We have grown wise in the analysis of the material world, have expanded thescope of ourperception to outer space and to the world beneath the atom. But objective innerexperiencehas faded almost entirely away, and it has left us groping in the dark for thetrue image ofourselves. 73It is the function of the Temple of Set, as of the ancient Egyptian priesthoods,thePythagorean Brotherhood, and the Platonic Academy before it, to inspire itsInitiates to awakento that knowledge which is latent within their consciousness and needs only tobe appreciated assuch. Winkler rightly points out that, the more highly initiated one becomes,the more one canexperience such prerogatives of Xeper. But this is a matter of perspective andproportion, not ofthe quality of immortality itself.It is all too easy to perceive “life” as only the active functioning of one’smaterial, OU-constituted body. Such an attitude fosters a disease of the psyche far worsethan any of the body.It numbs you to that immortality which is inherent in the Gift of Set, and itmakes you the preyof everyone who, in the profane world, seeks to control your life by threatsagainst your body.O. The Prince of DarknessSo the non-natural MindStar - the personalized, subjective “reflection” of the“Devil” - hasproven its existence many times over, and in a variety of contexts andsemblances. But what ofthe Form behind all such particularized manifestations - a creative source orFirst Principleof whose essence all non-natural souls partake? What of an actual,uniquely-existing “Devil”?During its 1966-1975 CE existence, the Church of Satan regarded its ownmythology with amixture of emotional fervor and intellectual uncertainty. The Church came intoexistence not asthe result of a philosophically-deduced need, but rather as a spontaneousgesture of exasperationwith and contempt for the hollowness and hypocrisy of conventional social andreligiousmorality. The Church was thus a “statement” - a glove thrown down - not of thatmorality per se,but rather of humanity’s impudence in announcing goals and standards for itselfwhich it hadneither capacity for nor intention of attaining. Satan, as the accuser andrebel, was the inevitablesymbol for this statement.73 Ibid., pages #19-21.- 174 -Having rejected conventional options, however, the Church found itself in theposition ofhaving to construct an alternative approach to morality. The result was animprecise blend ofpersonal hedonism with a rather cynical, Hobbesian attitude towards the rest ofsociety. Thoseable to achieve self-indulgent lifestyles - Satanists - should do so withoutqualms; ordinarypeople should be coldly exploited as befits their unimaginative and conservativebehavior- andthought-patterns. [Cf. Aristotle’s doctrine of “natural slavery”.]As for Satan himself, the Church began by making much of the sinister glamor ofthe Devil,both in its early rituals and in media coverage. In the Satanic Bible AntonLaVey proposed asimple identification of the Devil with any and all forms of pleasurableindulgence. Together witha lampooning and debunking of conventional religious dogma, this identificationconstitutes theprincipal theme of that volume’s “Book of Satan (authored by Ragnar Redbeard)”and “Book ofLucifer (authored by LaVey)”.But then the Satanic Bible becomes oddly vague. Satan himself is never reallydefined, saveas an allegory, semantic term, and/or symbol of the subjective, creative self.On page #62 it issaid that “most Satanists [think that Satan] merely represents a force of nature- the powers ofdarkness”. It is then implied that these “powers of darkness” are simply naturalforces whichneither religion nor science has yet identified or attempted to employ. TheSatanic Bibleadvocates using them for Indulgence - and that is where the discussion of Satanstops. Thereader is then thrown somewhat off the track, because the phraseology of therituals that followrecasts the Devil into one or more of his traditional, anthropomorphic molds.The paradox of conventional Satanism was that the Devil was understood to be aforce ofnature, thus being derived from and ultimately dependent upon “God” in some way.He maymake a lot of noise, but in the final analysis he is part of the sameall-inclusive machinery of theUniverse/God; even his “rebellion” is part of God’s Universal scheme. Satanists,accordingly,might be able to play a good game - but ultimately the deck is stacked againstthem. They cannotwin.The Church of Satan avoided this paradox by the simple technique ofprocrastinatingconfronting it. An atmosphere of psychodramatic atheism prevailed. Satan wasceremoniallyinvoked with great fervor, but in non-ceremonial surroundings even the mostdiehard Satanistshesitated to take a position concerning his reality. If references to hisexistence were made, theywere vague, cautious, and hypothetical.This attitude prevailed throughout all levels and branches of the Church. EvenAntonLaVey, when speaking of the Devil, was wont to employ such euphemisms as “theManDownstairs”, or to speak more cryptically of “forces”, “vibrations”, “angles”,and “atmospheres”.In addition to the “stacked deck” paradox, there was a second motive for thisreluctance tograpple with the issue of the Devil’s existence: the unspoken acknowledgmentthat atheism isultimately untenable. Throughout the OU there exists rigid adherence toprinciples of physicaland natural behavior; we may call this “order” or “consistency”. It is becauseof this consistencythat we can predict events in the physical, chemical, biological, andmathematical sciences.Scientists term such predictive patterns “laws”.[There is a school of philosophy called subjective or voluntaristic idealism, inwhichan effort is made to define nature as merely a creation of the mind, anobjectification of the will(Fichte, Schopenhauer), but the subjective idealists have not been able to provethat the OU isin fact a mental construct - for precisely the same reasons that they canchallenge theassumption that it does not enjoy objective existence apart from perception.Like theirpredecessor Descartes, they are ultimately forced to the assumption that onemust accept theevidence of the senses as reliable and to some extent impersonal.]- 175 -Recalling Thomas Aquinas’ failure to demonstrate the existence of God throughlogic, andthe consequent relapse of Christianity into a faith-based system, rational mindsof theEnlightenment era approached this “ordering” of the OU in two significant ways:First there is pantheism (sometimes called monistic idealism), whose most notedadvocate was the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677). According topantheism, Godand the universe are one and the same substance; everything that exists oroccurs is an aspect ofGod. Being neither separate from nor independent of the universe, God has nopersonalqualities. [It should not be supposed that Spinoza meant this as an “attack” onGod after thefashion of Nietzsche. Spinoza’s recommended attitude for human beings was whathe termed the“intellectual love of God” through a generalized appreciation of nature.]The perception of an “enforced” system of order or consistency throughout theentire OU,however, led some philosophers to induce the necessary existence of somethingexternal andsuperior to that universe. Conceptually the OU cannot “regulate” or “order”itself. Hence anotherschool of thought - deism - arose, its most noted proponent being GottfriedWilhelm Leibniz(1646-1716) of Leipzig. Deists differed from pantheists by postulating asuperior andindependent God, but one who, after creating the OU and its laws, refrains fromtampering withthem. Hence such a God never intervenes in human affairs or fortunes, whether ornot he isinterested in them.The Church of Satan adopted an essentially deistic attitude towards cosmology:“God”probably exists, but since he doesn’t involve himself in human affairs, there isno reason to courthis approval. Opening the door to the existence of “God”, however, opens thesame door to theexistence of another intelligent entity apart from the OU. The Devil can thusexist in theory. Isthere any evidence that he does in actuality?The Enlightenment philosophers assumed mankind to be compatible with, henceincludedin the order of the OU. Human behavior was just another kind of science to beexplored andmastered. [It is no accident that the Enlightenment saw the birth of “socialcontract” theories ofgovernment, based on speculations about the “natural ordering” of humansociety.] But, whilesocial contract approaches to government and politics have enjoyed some measureof success inthe subsequent centuries, they have by no means demonstrated their inclusion ofindividualcreative power and the force of will. At the close of the 20th century, most ofthe great socialcontract experiments, if they have survived at all, have mutated into a kind oftechnologicalMachiavellianism in which individual drive, leadership, and fortune determinethe shape of thepresent and the direction of the future.We confront, therefore, a scenario in which the OU is increasingly exposed as aconsistent,interrelated machine - and in which the human intellect is increasingly exposedas somethingwhich has defied all attempts to relegate it to a function of this machine.Mankind displays apotential for intellectual external-perspective and willful creation that is insharp contrast toeverything else that is known concerning this OU.Consider the vast intellectual gap between mankind and every other species onthe planet.One has only to walk into a major library to sense the extent of this gap. Muchis made about therelatively high intelligence of chimpanzees, dolphins, etc.; yet the mostintelligent of theirnumber cannot remotely compare with even the most primitive examples of homosapiens.Moreover, say physiologists, even the most exalted levels of human intelligenceand knowledgehave been attained with only 10-20% of the reasoning potential of the humancerebrum. Howand why did humanity acquire this freakishly high intelligence potential?While anthropologists can chart the stages of prehistoric human evolution to thelimits ofavailable data, they remain unable to explain why the entire phenomenon shouldhave occurredat all. The best they can do, in textbook after textbook, is to say that “mandeveloped highintelligence because he needed it to survive”. According to this theory,proto-men were lacking in- 176 -speed, strength, fighting teeth & claws, and other physical attributes necessaryfor survival.Mutants with greater intelligence tended to survive through cunning, sustainingtheirdescendants, while less-intelligent groups died out. This process, repeated oversome five millionyears, resulted in homo sapiens, the prototype of Cro-Magnon, Neanderthal, andModern Man.The escape clause in this theory is the time factor: Five million years isplenty of time foralmost anything to evolve into almost anything else. Besides, the anthropologistwill say, theentire primate development process can be traced to origins some fifty millionsof years ago.Hence the condition of Modern Man isn’t as startling as it would be had ithappened “overnight”.All well and good, but there are at least two problems with this proposition.One is thatproto-man was just one of many animal species fighting for survival over themillennia. If hisbrain could evolve through processes of natural selection, then why did thebrains of othercreatures not similarly evolve - at least a little? The fact is that the brainsof other creatures haveremained practically the same size while man’s has “evolved”. This isinconsistent, and it willbe recalled that the hallmark of the OU - and deistic proof of God - is itsconsistency. By thelaw of averages - which applies to natural selection as much as to anything else- there shouldhave been at least some species other than man evolving in intelligence at leastpartway to thehuman level. There is none.The second problem arises through application of one of the bastion theories ofDarwiniannatural selection. It is that nature always takes the easiest way out - thatselection favors the less-complicated adaptation over a more complex alternative. When a time of faminefavors speciesable to reach higher for herbal food, longer-necked giraffes survive. We do notsee short-neckedgiraffes with wings. A more-or-less easy physical modification must firstaccidentally occur ina species; thereafter selection takes place against those who do not possess thecharacteristic.That is the way evolution actually works.But there is no explanation for human brain evolution in the laws of naturalselection. Thebiophysical factors of a sophisticated brain are far too intricate. A proto-mantrying to adapt tohostile environments through brain modification would have died out long beforesuch externalstress as he could bring to bear on his brain would have any effect upon thatorgan [if indeedthey would have any physiological effect at all]. In the case of proto-man,natural selection wouldoccur in favor of almost anything else besides the brain. He would becomestronger, hairier,tougher, meaner, and faster. According to natural selection, you and I should begorillas.But we are not gorillas. Indeed, as our intelligence has made life progressivelyeasier for us,we have become weaker and more vulnerable physically. We are healthier and morelong-livedonly because our intelligence has enabled us to produce medicines to stave offdiseases, anddietary standards to maximize our health and growth potential. We havecontrolledenvironments to fend off the elements, and have developed weapons to fend offother creatures.Take away our abnormal intelligence and mankind would die out or be killed offwithin a fewgenerations. Because of our brain, then, the natural evolution of the rest ofour body [whichwould normally operate in favor of an unaided tougher, more disease-freephysiology] hasactually operated in reverse. Once more this is inconsistent.There is a corollary to the second problem. It is that natural selection, whenit does occur,does not overcompensate. If conditions allow all giraffes with four-foot necksto survive, there isno reason for the species to evolve in the direction of forty-foot necks. If thehuman brain werepresumed to be the product of natural selection, why should it possessintelligence greater thanthat required to raise man to stone-age culture? More than than, why should itpossess thecapacity to be ten times smarter than it is today?If human high intelligence is a violation of OU law, how did it occur? There aretwo possibleexplanations: accident or deliberate cause. If accidental cause is assumed, thenthe accidentwould have had to be both a major violation of the law and one which sustaineditself over- 177 -several millennia. And if there were one such accident, the laws of probabilitywould necessitateothers in lesser degrees [and greater numbers]. In all of the manymanifestations of life andevolution with which we are familiar, we know of no other such accidents.Natural law’s grip oneverything else besides ourselves appears total and inescapable. We are leftwith the secondexplanation: deliberate cause.During the Age of Satan (1966-1975 CE) a certain “racial memory” of someprehistoricchange to the natural course of human evolution seemed to be asserting itself.74 The mostspectacular and explicit example was the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C.Clarke’svariation on the theme of his earlier novel Childhood’s End. In 2001 proto-man’sintelligencewas artificially boosted by a rectangular monolith. In Childhood’s End the sameoperation wasperformed by an extraterrestrial creature looking precisely like the traditionalDevil. Presumablythe spectacle of a tribe of man-apes thronging around Satan would have been abit too shockingfor audiences; hence the substitution of the more abstract monolith in the film.Intriguingly themonolithic Satan-symbol provoked no adverse criticism from viewers, religious orotherwise.Once the religious myths are removed, the “fall” of man is seen as his rise.Such a 2001-style tinkering with human intellectual evolution would have had tooccur atthe genetic level, and presumably [so as to be sustained by normal reproduction]over anextended period of time. So we are looking at a subtle process, not a sudden,dramatic event [asin Adam & Eve’s apple-munching or Prometheus’ fire-giving]. We do not havesufficientknowledge of genetics or of the brain’s physiology to know precisely how suchtinkering mighthave taken place - though we can estimate it. 75 That it did in fact take placeis indicated only -but inescapably - by the presence of the fait accompli.The “ancient astronaut” theories of van Däniken et al. may be dispensed withperemptorily.The human body displays an organic constitution completely compatible with thoseof otherEarthly species, and alien astronauts could not have taught anything to aproto-man whoseintelligence had not already developed to a high level.There are a great many genuine curiosities of antiquity which suggest thatmankind’sadvanced intelligence made its presence known long before the recordedcivilizations of Egypt,Sumer, China, etc. But, despite torturous efforts to interpret toys orMeso-American murals as“spaceships”, evidence of alien astronauts on Earth remains conspicuous for itsabsence.Mankind’s inability to detect the author of our “high intelligence experiment”should not beconsidered as evidence that he does not exist, but simply that he has not beendiscovered andidentified. Nor, one may add, has mankind been actively looking for him. Insteadit has been offfirst on the wild-goose chase of religious-creationism, then on the wild-goosechase of naturalselection [as applied to the brain]. Nevertheless he exists; the conclusiveevidence exists. Toquote Walt Kelly’s Pogo: “Us is it.”To sum up: We know that there is evidence for the existence of an intelligententity distinctfrom the OU and thus in incidental, if not deliberate conflict with its laws.For whatever itsreasons, it has instilled in humanity the potential to enjoy the same externalperspective, as wellas the intelligence to do so with deliberate, creative purpose. Some humanssense this potentialand thrill to it; we call them the Elect. Most others do not think precisely andrigorously enoughto detect it in themselves; or, if they do, they fear it and try to sublimate,repress, or destroy it.Hence they have represented our Mysterious Stranger as the Devil. We know him byhis mostancient name of Set.The Temple of Set is thus an association of the Elect to honor Set, exalt hisGift to ourselves,and exercise it with the greatest possible wisdom. As Set is a metaphysicalentity, apart from the74 See Appendix #95.75 See Appendix #96.- 178 -OU, he may be likened to a “god” as conventional society employs the term. Inthis sense theTemple of Set is a religion - not one which is based on irrational faith, butone which derives itscore principles from exercise of the evident and conspicuous Gift of its neter.P. Historical OU/SU InterpretationsThe cosmological premise of the Temple of Set is that there is one multiverse,consistingof the totality of existence. Within it are the OU [whose components occupyspace and arerelated by time] and each sentient being’s SU. The SU may be thought of [atleast during one’sOU-bodily incarnation] as one’s personal perspective on the OU, together withany self-createdphenomena one wishes to add to it.In the “exclusive” OU, a house is simply a geometrically-coordinated,gravitationally-bracedand weatherproof arrangement of certain kinds of molecules. As variousindividuals design,decorate, occupy, or view the house, however, it is imbued with characteristicsassigned to it bythem [cf. Kant in “The Psyche”]. It now exists in their several SUs, and it maycontinue to existthere even after the OU house has been demolished.As various people discuss the house, moreover, their SU concepts concerning itwill beexchanged. Thus SUs may themselves overlap. This is another way of defining“intellectualaffinity”, and it is also a precondition for affection and love.It is open to question whether an individual can detect the existence of the OUat all, savethrough the “distorting medium” of his SU. Rene Descartes’ famous statement “Ithink; thereforeI exist” was the result of his attempt to batter through his SU to secureevidence of the OU’sreality [and his existence within it]. The Irish philosopher George Berkeleydisputed Descartes,claiming that the OU does not exist - that such reliable data as we haveconcerning it are merelyagreements or similarities between our several SUs. The creator and “enforcer”of thesesimilarities, Berkeley continued, is the divine mind (i.e. a God or gods).Berkeley’s philosophy is called immaterialism. It was followed by two offshoots:solipsism and subjective idealism. Solipsism disputes the existence of a divinemind, andindeed of any other individual minds. To the solipsist, the universe consists of“nothing butmyself and my ideas”. The physical world, including the human beings populatingit, are simplyfigments of one’s imagination. [If one should be “attacked” by such a figment,the sensation ofthe fight and the bruises resulting from it would be viewed by the solipsist asunpleasantfantasies of his mind originating, beyond his conscious control, in itssubconscious depths.]Subjective idealism, whose most prominent proponent was the German philosopherJohann Gottlieb Fichte, was an approach to immaterialism that seemed to be “lessabsurd” thansolipsism. Fichte began by acknowledging that neither materialism (the existenceof nothing butthe OU) nor immaterialism (the existence of nothing but the SU) can beestablished. Aphilosopher must arbitrarily accept either one or the other as a point ofdeparture, thenconstruct his theories from that platform.Fichte opted for immaterialism. He felt that he existed, per Descartes’ maxim.But, unlikeDescartes, he didn’t trust in God to subsequently impart to him reliable sensoryimpressions ofan OU. He postulated the original existence of a mental essence divided into theego (thesensation of the self) and the non-ego (sensations of things not perceived asthe self). Thismental essence is more impersonal than the subconsciousness of the solipsist.The essence is asort of “supermind” which transcends all particular ego and non-egomanifestations.As noted above, Fichte chose the premise of immaterialism and from it developedthephilosophy of subjective idealism. His successor, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,chose thepremise of materialism and from it developed the philosophy of objectiveidealism. In itssimplest form, this philosophy imparts reality to the OU, making all SUs simplyaspects of it.- 179 -Hegel’s OU, however, is not a physical substance. Rather it is an all-embracing,absolute mindwhich is racing through its many ideas to reconcile them, refine them, andultimately realizeitself through them. This is the “evolution” of the universe, and is what Hegelreferred to as thehistorical “dialectic” of thesis/ antithesis> synthesis.Endless debates rage concerning these and other metaphysical theories. This isnot theplace to attempt to resolve them. They are introduced in elemental form simplyin order toillustrate the role that the concepts of the SU and OU play in them. They are“building blocks”:points of reference.Using these building blocks, the individual may conceive of himself as aself-conscious,intelligent entity who confronts the OU and SU from a point of externalperspective. [Whetherthis external perspective extends to the SU is problematic; this is like askingthe mind whether itcan get outside itself! But for our purposes an external perspective on the OU,together with arealization of the SU, will suffice.] The challenge of existence is thus how toapproach bothuniverses intelligently and rewardingly.There are two essential approaches to each universe, which may be termed naturalandnon-natural. 76 Hence a total of four possible approaches: (1) natural/OU, (2)non-natural/OU,(3) natural/SU, and (4) non-natural/SU. Each will now be discussed in turn.Q. Personal OU/SU Perspectives1. The Natural Approach to the Objective UniverseThe natural approach to the OU is to endeavor to blend in with it, to harmonizewith it, tobecome one with it. In one mythological context or another, this is the goal ofall conventionalreligions, which view man’s estrangement from the OU as something “out ofadjustment” at bestand “sinful” at worst. A fundamental paradox is involved, however, which makessuch a goal ofreunification impossible. The paradox is that the very desire to attain unionwith the OUevidences the individual’s essential separateness from that universe. It followsthat anyconscious act relative to that universe - even one which seeks to approach it -is an exercise ofthat separateness. Hence to be aware of one’s disconnection from that universeis to remaindisconnected from it.Jesus Christ is reputed to have said that, to enter Heaven, one must be “as alittle child”. Toput it another way, such a person would have to radiate an innocent, selflesspassion for theharmony of the Universe; he would be unable to conceive himself as apart fromit.The irony of Christ’s admonition is that neither innocence nor selflessness areproducts of the conscious intellect. Hence he was stating a truth about whichthoselistening to him could do nothing, whether or not they understood or agreed withhim. Onecannot “decide to be innocent” or “resolve to be selfless”. One can conductone’s life as thoughone were innocent and selfless, of course - and be a nice person who does nicethings for othersin the process. But beneath all appearances, all affectations, the actual stateof the soul remainsas it is: either animal/natural or human/enlightened, either asleep and ignorantor awake and alltoo aware.It is nothing short of horrifying to review the record of man’s efforts to “getat” the state ofthe human soul. He has cruelly tortured the body and the mind, even destroyedlife itself inefforts to suppress or exterminate the “Satanic” state of self-awareness andpride in personalexistence. He has concocted innumerable religions and substitute-religionspurporting to be ableto snuff out this flame; these have used every conceivable combination of drugs,incense,76 See Appendix #97.- 180 -pageantry, recitation, ritual, and even Thomistic-style “logic” whoseconclusions are safelypredetermined by faith-derived axioms.All such devices are ultimately of no avail. At most they confuse, distort, andlull - but in theend “are all spirits, and are melted into air”. They are false, useless,meaningless, and tragic -tragic in the sense of the ancient Greek dramas: futile efforts of an Œdipusstrugglingpathetically to evade what the gods had decided must be.Such efforts to deceive the consciousness into believing that it has beenaccepted into theOU are defined by the Temple of Set as White Magic (WM). It will be noted thatthis definitionis far broader and less value-laden than pop-occultists’ use of the term. WMembraces not onlyall conventional religions, but all pagan or nature-worship ideologies as well.To the Temple, theonly distinction between them is one of style and imagery, not of underlyingpurpose.Atheists and logical positivists attempt to create the illusion of man’sinclusion in the OUsimply by refusing to admit to the possibility of any alternative. Suchindividuals brusquely denythat anything worthwhile exists in the SU, which they consider useful only forfantasy andescapism. Such natural/objectivists thus include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hume, andMarx, as wellas the Sophists of Hellenic Greece and the later Stoics of the Hellenistic andRoman eras ofMediterranean culture.When confronted with metaphysical issues, natural/objectivists profess annoyanceat such“useless” speculation. They pride themselves on practicality, on common sense,and on materialinterests. If they are involved in religion at all, it is only as a means forsocial or politicalinfluence, as in Rousseau’s contemptuously-advocated “civil religion” - or inorder to “scratchthe itch” [with as little intellectual bother as possible] of the sublimatedfeeling that there justmight be something more to the universe than their bourgeois materialism.2. The Non-Natural Approach to the Objective UniverseIf one assumes that one is an independent entity moving about in the OU, andthat onecannot merge one’s consciousness with it - that all attempts to do so are mereillusions anddelusions - then one approaches the OU as a tool to be used for personalsatisfaction. Natural/objective religionists are regarded as irrational, and natural/ objectiveatheists are regarded asignorant.The non-natural/objectivist makes a careful study of the OU from hisself-realized externalperspective, and he includes in that study consideration for the subjective,metaphysical forcesthat influence human disposition and behavior (i.e. others’ SUs). He thenapplies his knowledgeto entities and events in the OU and through this medium to others’ SUs, tocontrol or at leastinfluence events and perceptions in accordance with his will. This is defined bythe Temple of Setas Lesser Black Magic (LBM). 77It will be understood that competence in this art gives the practitionerenormous power toaffect situations in ways that could scarcely be understood by those involved,even if they wereaware of the various forces being brought to bear on them. It thus follows thatrigorouseducation in ethics is an absolute necessity for would-be Black Magicians - elsethroughignorance, immaturity, or impulsiveness they bring about unjustified or evenunnecessarydamage or destruction. As has been noted, the OU is in a state of naturalequilibrium, andany adjustment to it risks disrupting that equilibrium. Some adjustments aretolerable, and someare even beneficial. But some which seem positive at first glance may be harmfulin a larger77 For a detailed study of LBM techniques and how they may be applied to thereduction, if not complete eliminationof human warfare, see Michael A Aquino, MindWar (2016).- 181 -perspective, as in the extermination of “harmful” mountain lions whichultimately results inoverpopulation and mass starvation of their natural prey.The adept practitioner of LBM is thus not a crude predator; he is an adjustor, amanipulator, a metaphysician. He does not practice his art for petty egotism,but rather for thegreater satisfaction he derives in the experience and exercise of his wisdom -which as a by-product invariably satisfies whatever material goals he may deem appropriate tothe situation.A second non-natural approach to the OU is actually a simplified, directedapplication ofGreater Black Magic (GBM) [see discussion below] towards the solving of problemsoradjustment of situations in the OU. This special application, bridging the gapbetween GBM andLBM, is called Medial Black Magic (MBM). It is discussed in Chapter #21.3. The Natural Approach to the Subjective UniverseThe atheistic natural/objectivist, as stated above, regards subjectiveimpressions as unrealand unimportant save as escapist entertainment. This is the realm ofscience-fiction and fantasywriters, of escapist movies, of commercially-driven artists and musicians. Theirlitany - aninvariable identifier - is that their work has no usefulness apart from theemotional pleasure itbrings and such allegorical references as it makes to “realities” in the OU. Theoccasional writer,artist, philosopher, or musician who refuses to disclaim the more “disturbing”aspects of hiswork as mere entertainment - as in the case of Wagner, Crowley, von Stroheim,Nietzsche - isliable to be dismissed as an eccentric at best or condemned as a madman atworst. Profanesociety fears few things more than recognized genius which is not directedtowards“safe, predetermined” goals.The religious natural/objectivist, who creates subjective experiences forhimself to reinforcehis sense of inclusion in the OU, accepts the reality of the SU only insofar ashis sensations of itprovide that reinforcement. When these do not, they are labeled heresy, fantasy,or mentaldisease. Once again the determining factor is the relevant religious dogma,against which allsubjective experiences are measured and evaluated.The common factor in both natural/objectivist approaches to the SU is that it isrigidlyregarded as insubstantial, impotent, and unreal. It can thus be cynicallyendorsed and even citedas authority when convenient [as the more successful conventional religions havedone]; and itcan just as easily be ignored when inconvenient or unprofitable. It is aplaything. Except to theextent that they have fallen victim to their own artificially-induced delusions,religious leaders/white magicians comfortably ignore their “gods” whenever it suits their purposesto do so. Or, ifin a position to “interpret” said gods, they do so with a calculated eye totheir own comfort andadvantage.It is one of the great oddities of human civilization that such transparentfrauds attract anyadherents at all, much less worldwide followings. John Fowles has suggested thatit results frommankind’s psychological starvation for mystery. “If no one will write newdetective stories,” heobserves in his The Aristos, “then people will still read the old ones.”4. The Non-Natural Approach to the Subjective UniverseThe individual with a basic non-natural (“Satanic”) sense of self-awareness neednotconfront the SU directly. He may be content to use it symbolically, as a devicefor emphasizingand formalizing his LBM goals. This was the approach of the vast majority ofthose who affiliatedwith the Church of Satan from 1966 to 1975. Many of the Church’s most exotic -and seeminglyliteral - rituals are thus correctly understood as LBM psychodramas. As suchthey could bestartlingly effective.- 182 -But what had begun as a somewhat tongue-in-cheek exercise in monster-movietheatricsand social satire gradually evolved into an increasingly more focused search forthe principlesbehind such effectiveness. It was this search which culminated in themetamorphosis of theChurch of Satan into the Temple of Set in 1975 - minus those who were unable orunwilling tosee past the original psychodramatic concept.The theory and practice of non-natural interaction with the SU is defined asGreaterBlack Magic (GBM). It involves first the exploration of one’s SU, other SUswhich may beinvolved, and relevant portions of the OU to their conceptual frontiers [if notlimits]. Therefollows a precise, coherent, and deliberate focusing of the will of the creativeself to adjustfeatures of the SUs (personal and others’) to the desired state, which may ormay not be “real” inthe OU.The concept of magic postulates that there is a continuous “linkage” - generallyreferred toas the Magical Link (ML) - between the OU and SUs. Hence a change occurring inone willhave at least a partially similar effect in the other.It is easy to explain why the OU should influence the SU, but explaining thereverseinfluence is rather more subtle and complex. It is the active application of theML conceptualizedby Fichte, through which application the concentrated energies of the ego create“patterns” inthe over-reaching mean essence, which patterns in turn create related, if notcompletely identical“patterns” in the non-ego part of the mental essence - which is that whichdefines and bindstogether the laws of consistency in the OU. [If you are intimidated by Fichte,go see the original(now “Episode IV”) Star Wars film and you’ll get the general idea.]GBM is difficult to conceptualize, difficult to master theoretically, anddifficult to practicereliably - but it does work. It may take effect in greater or lesser degree, butin any given case itis virtually impossible to predict that degree.The chances of success in a GBM working are presumably improved if one does notattempttoo great a “distortion” in the laws of consistency of the OU, and if oneapplies extraordinaryenergy to the corresponding phenomena in the SU(s). One must also take advantageof everycooperative force in the OU to enhance the working, using GBM to “tip thebalance” rather thando the whole job. Thus GBM is ideally supported by LBM, though the converse isnot true. AntonLaVey referred to the consideration of peripheral factors in support of a GBMworking as thebalance factor in magic.Recently the term “Medial Black Magic” (MBM) has been introduced to describe GBMWorkings of a very simple, directed design with the specific and exclusivepurpose of influencingthe OU. These influences or effects in the OU then, either incidentally or byintent, impact otherSUs which experience the phenomena. [Cf. Chapter #21.]It is in the process of making the preliminary exploration of the SU and OU thatthe BlackMagician begins to discover and ultimately to know how things really work. Heexists whollyin neither the SU [like a mystic] nor the OU [like a materialist]. He regardsneither one as a toy,nor denies it reality. He moves back and forth between the two with increasingease andexpertise, influencing the MLs between them and thus causing change inaccordance withhis will.In the process he becomes wise, but because he considers both universes whengivingopinions, non-magicians may consider much of his wisdom as folly. It is not; itmerely takes intoaccount more dimensions of a particular problem than onlookers are likely tosee. A magicianwho accumulates extraordinary wisdom of this “mixed” type is said to possessUnderstanding.One is taught to become expert in natural approaches to the OU throughconventionaleducation in the social and physical sciences, and in natural approaches to theSU through thearts. The Church of Satan taught the theory and practice of LBM, and the Templeof Set adds tothat the theory and practice of GBM.- 183 -Just as education in natural approaches cannot guarantee that one will becomecompetentin applying that education, so education in non-natural approaches cannotguarantee that onewill become adept in their exercise. Many would-be magicians accumulate much“textbooklearning”, yet prove unable to do anything with it. It may be because they don’ttry to apply it, orbecause they don’t have the talent for it, or because they don’t have theintelligence to reallyunderstand it. The Temple of Set, as is the case with other ethical, initiatoryinstitutions inhistory, teaches theory and Recognizes expertise in that theory. It cannotguarantee expertise inpractice.- 184 -[index-185_1.jpg][index-185_2.jpg]- 185 -17: InitiationA. ConceptIndividuals who find their way to the Temple of Set are known as the Elect. Thisterm has asubtle significance of its own. It means “chosen” - but it does not identify thechooser. Thatchooser may be Set; it may be oneself; it may be pure hazard. Nor does it implyprivilege,aristocracy, or guaranteed success. It is, simply, an acknowledgment that theaspirant stands atthese gates which only a comparative few have encountered. Like Parsifal,Jonathan Harker,Her-Bak, or Nicholas Urfe, the aspirant either steps forward into the Temple -or turns back intoprofane existence. 78“Initiation” is the term used to describe the experience of an affiliate of theTemple of Set.Since the term is very easily misunderstood and misused, its usage within and bythe Templedeserves careful explanation.In its traditional sense, initiation is induction into the membership of asecret society,hence being entitled to successively more exclusive secrets as the level ofinitiation rises. There isusually a good deal of occult hot air mixed in with this, in that the candidateis exhortedconcerning the excellence he has had to display to be worthy of the honor, thesublime dignity ofthe initiation itself, and the fearful consequences should he betray itssecrets.Many initiatory societies are little more than financial rackets, while othersare more or lesssincere in what they are trying to do. Most esoteric knowledge imparted underthe guise ofinitiation is not particularly practical. Rather it is vague, theatrical,mystical, and inconclusive:obscurum per obscurius (“explaining the obscure by means of the more obscure”).The new“initiate” is left with a pleasing feeling of heightened importance, yet issomehow unable toexplain why.Authentic initiation is not simply the acquisition of specific knowledge orskills; it involves acertain approach to the challenges of existence in general. An initiate, like acat, must learn toland on his feet in any situation in which he may find himself. He does this bythe acquired andapplied technique of “stepping back to view the situation from outside himself”.He assignsrelative importance to it, estimates his options as an actor within it, andactivates the mostappropriate such option. He may make mistakes due to lack of information, but herarely errs onthe basis of what he does know. His developing sense of intuition, moreover,will warn him78 There is an interesting metaphor of this principle in Bram Stoker’s Dracula.After opening the door of his castle toJonathan Harker and welcoming him, Count Dracula becomes silent and motionlessuntil Harker steps across thethreshold. Only then does Dracula become the gracious host.- 186 -whenever a situation is not whatever it immediately seems to be. He can thenavoid prematureconclusions and impulsive actions.The Temple of Set conceives the process of initiation as a Socratic refutationof confused,imprecise, and unsubstantiated information and thinking. It is the imparting oftruth as much aswe know it to be, but even more importantly it is the imparting of the abilityto pursue truth andto recognize it when it is found.Wisdom - knowledge of truth - cannot be taught to stupid intellects. A love ofand insistenceupon the truth cannot be taught to unethical individuals. Hence initiation isnot something thatcan be “done to” someone merely by subjecting him to a series of classes,examinations, andceremonies. All that the Temple can do - and all that it tries to do - is tospread out its banquet oftruths, probabilities, hypotheses, and speculations before aspirants whom weevaluate asreasonably sincere. They must then utilize it, together with such otherresources as they maydevelop, to achieve wisdom. Thus do they initiate themselves.By its membership and degree system, the Temple merely formalizes thedemonstratedlevels of this achievement. This is why initiation within the Temple of Set isreferred to as aprocess of Recognition.The term “degree” is used because initiation itself is a constantly ongoing andexpandingprocess. Hence one never attains initiation per se; rather one attains aparticular “degree of”initiation.The parameters of each Setian degree also expand as the Temple as a wholeincreases inwisdom and sophistication. This is in keeping with the principle of Xeper(“becoming”), whichidentifies the process of constantly-expanding personal evolution. “Science isnot; it isbecoming,” wrote Mikhail Bakunin [in God and the State, 1882 CE]. “The learnedman of todayis but the know-nothing of tomorrow. Let him once imagine that he has reachedthe end, and forthat very reason he sinks beneath even the babe just born.”Within the Temple one does not become party to the “secrets of a degree” byfirst beingappointed to that degree. Rather one, through his pursuit of wisdom and truth,graduallyacquires those “secrets” through his own efforts, within and without theresearch systems of theTemple. If it is perceived that he has reached the level of wisdom and skillappropriate to ahigher degree, he is Recognized as being entitled to that degree.There are no penalties for revealing “esoteric secrets” in the Temple. We existto promoteknowledge of truth, not to conceal it. Setians should understand, however, thatsome of thetruths known to the Priesthood of Set can be dangerous to oneself or others ifmisapplied, just asa loaded gun in the hands of a child is dangerous. Be careful what “guns” ofyour acquiredknowledge you place in the hands of profane “children”.B. TruthIt is impossible to overestimate the importance of the concept of truth to theraison d’etreof the Temple of Set. In the last analysis the Temple is a tool to uncovertruth, and a vehicle forits promotion and application. Various historic initiatory systems have failedto the extent thatthey have subordinated truth to anything else - impressiveness, wealth, power,luxury, laziness ...the list of excuses, apologies, and rationalizations is endless.The Temple agrees with Pythagoras and Plato that truth is an absolute Form orfirstprinciple, which may be apprehended in specific instances through a combinationofintellectual effort and enlightened intuition. Rigorous examination of theintellectual process -such as takes place in the Platonic Dialogues - is necessary to suchapprehension. Thus it isimportant to educate oneself in what is known, as well as to develop one’sanalytical and criticalabilities, before attempting to apprehend the unknown.- 187 -Intuition - the power or faculty of knowing things without conscious reasoning -is anessential attribute of the initiate. Neither reasoning nor intuition alone willsuffice; each must beused in conjunction with the other. Intuition alone can easily become merefantasy andmysticism, while inductive reasoning can produce “logical” conclusions which areneverthelesswrong.Plato’s concept of nœsis - the “capstone” of his “pyramid of thought”, referredto a supremestate of enlightened apprehension in which “the Truth” and “the Good” becomeindistinguishable. Insofar as such a perception is unique and inevitable, it isalso teleological,constituting the telos, or ultimate end/purpose of the concept beinginvestigated.Friedrich Nietzsche felt, however, that where humanity is concerned, “truth”must bejudged in terms of its application. In his Genealogy of Morals he cautionedagainst the “asceticideal”: an interpretation of the Will to Power that is in fact a Will to Truth (Wille zur Wahrheit).In a world of imperfections and duplicity, this ideal becomes a surrogate forthe divine. Appliedto external God/gods it is indefinable; applied to oneself it becomes anever-expanding, ever-receding measure of initiatory perfection.C. EkstasisTo appreciate the initiatory significance of ekstasis, it is first necessary tounderstand whatit is, and that is most easily approached by what it is not.What is common to all of Plato’s “Pyramid of Thought” categories - eikasia,pistis, dianoia,and nœsis is the processing of thought based upon sensory input and logicalmanipulation ofsame. Even the capstone, nœsis, requires a dianoic substructure, refined by themost exactingreduction of imperfections, to appear in truth. Hence, for example, the nœsis ofthe Book ofComing Forth by Night required extensive analysis and substantiation followingthe NorthSolstice X. That could not prove the working in its entirety, but it couldsignificantly contributeto the probability of that proof.Ekstasis, on the other hand, is a psychic process which stands apart from themanipulationof sensory information by reasoning. Because of this ethereality it is almostbeyond defining perour usual, logical language. The etymology of the term itself is illustrative:The original Greekekstasis means “astonishment” or “distraction”, which in late Latin becameextasis, “terror”.While we can only approximate what the ancients were trying to convey by suchexpressions, it is apparent that they regarded ekstasis with caution. It was theultimate“uncharted territory” of conscious existence, the awareness of self-existencewithout reference toanything external at all.In Setian philosophy this is akin to becoming as Set himself, not merelyadapting hisprinciples to our respective circumstances in the Objective Universe, or to oursensory-referenced visions in our individual Subjective Universes. The ecstatic psychegenerates andsustains its own complete universe.This is a [real!] Big Bang, to be sure, and it is unsurprising that profanesociety, and profanephilosophy, have shied away from confronting it directly. In common usage“ecstasy” ischeapened into nothing more than an emotional rush, an “out-of-body experience”,or the kindof self-annihilating trance symbolized by nirvana or religious rapture. Commonto all theseinterpretations is their dead-end: Persons so stunned become completely numb andneutralized.They don’t know who they are, what their consciousness is, or what they can orshould do with itnow. Perhaps the most classic illustration of this profane dilemma is the StarChild at the end ofClarke’s/Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. He didn’t know what to do withhimself, but, wroteClarke lamely, “he would think of something”.- 188 -For the Setian, however, attainment of ekstasis is the inevitable, ultimateconsequence ofinitiation. Hegel regarded all external phenomena, the flow of universalhistory, as “the mind ofGod in the process of completely understanding itself”. Separately and severallywe are not quiteso grandiose; we grant that we are all unfolding gods and goddesses. Ourrealization of ekstasis,therefore, is not exclusionary: there remains “otherness”.It is perhaps not surprising that artists and musicians flirt with ekstasis intheir creativeexplosions, a marvelous aspect of which is that we who look and listen can sharetheir thrilling“terror” with them. In the Order of the Trapezoid’s Runes I quoted Adolf Hitler:Music and architecture - Is it not in these disciplines that we find recordedthe pathof humanity's ascent? When I hear Wagner, it seems to me that I hear rhythms ofabygone world. I imagine to myself that one day science will discover, in thewaves set inmotion by the Rheingold, secret mutual relations connected with the order of theworld.The observation of the world perceived by the senses precedes the knowledgegiven byexact science as well as by philosophy. It is insofar as percipient awarenessapproachestruth that it has value. 79Thus may we “preview” ekstasis in so many wonderful ways en route to itsultimate,complete envelopment of our existence, which is the secret of what the profaneignorantly andfearfully regard as “death”.D. The Two PathsThe terms “Left-Hand Path” (LHP) and “Right-Hand Path” (RHP) are used indifferent andoften incompatible ways by various occultists. Reportedly the terms originatedin Tantrism, aschool of Vajrayana Buddhism in northern India which taught that Buddhahood canbe realizedthrough various theurgic practices. For mantra and mudra ceremonies the femalewaspositioned to the right of the male; for erotic rites she was positioned to theleft. Theosophy’sH.P. Blavatsky felt sex-magic to be immoral and perverse, so she subsequentlyemployed theterm “LHP” to characterize the magical systems she didn’t like, and the term“RHP” tocharacterize the ones she did, i.e. Theosophy. Post-Blavatsky the terms havebeen expandedthrough popular usage to refer generally to what the Temple of Set defines asWhite Magic(RHP) and Black Magic (LHP).Most popular-occult organizations, to be sure, use the two terms simply toidentify theirmoral biases. What they consider “good” is RHP, and what they consider “evil” isLHP. AfterAleister Crowley left the Golden Dawn, he portrayed it as a “Black Lodge” andhis own A.'.A.'. asthe “Great White Brotherhood”; while on the other side of the fence W.B. Yeatsand other G.'.D.'.leaders considered Crowley to be the Black Magician.To further complicate the matter, there have been some deliberately criminal“Satanic”organizations which have avowedly followed the LHP as defined by those whoconsider itsynonymous with degenerate and destructive practices. Such episodes have ofcourseserved to reinforce the conventional religious image of Satanism and Black Magicas nefariouspractices.So enduring was this stereotype that the Church of Satan found it very difficultto break freefrom it during the entire decade of its existence. All sorts of creeps,crackpots, criminals, andcranks pounded on the door of the Church, assuming that it would excuse andencourage79 Hitler, Adolf, in H.R. Trevor-Roper (Ed.) Hitler’s Secret Conversations. NY:Farrar, Straus & Young, 1953, page#205.- 189 -whatever social shortcomings they embraced. The Temple of Set has generallyavoided thisproblem, mostly through careful admissions screening, but also because “Satan”is popularlyassociated with “evil” while “Set” is largely unknown outside of Egyptologicalcircles.The Temple of Set’s LHP orientation is, as noted above, a function of itsdefinition of BlackMagic. No moral or ethical stances are implied by the terms LHP and RHP per se,since theyrefer to techniques and systems rather than to the ends to which they areapplied.As defined within the Temple of Set:• The Left-Hand Path (LHP) involves the conscious attempt to preserve andstrengthen one’s isolate, psychecentric existence against the OU while creating,apprehending, comprehending, and influencing a varying number of SUs.• The Right-Hand Path (RHP) involves the intentional effort to dissolve or mergethe self into the OU.To the Setian the LHP is neither “good” nor “evil”; it is merely an avenuetowardsknowledge and power. While he may consider the RHP fruitless and/or deceptive,he likewiseforbears to pronounce moral judgments concerning it. Indeed, some of theTemple’s mostvaluable information comes from individuals and institutions who are/werethoroughlyconvinced that they are/were treading the RHP.Followers of the RHP are those whose stated goal is egocentric absorption intothe OU[which they confuse with the Universe as a whole]. They wish to harmonize theiractions with it,attune their intellects and emotions to what they consider the God of UniversalConsciousness,and thus partake of the immortality and divinity presumably characterizing thatConsciousness.This is the theoretical nirvana of the Buddhist, the Jainist, and the Hindu; the“salvation” of theChristian.The dilemma, of course, lies in the problem of “destroying” the ego and thencontinuing toexist on Earth thinking, talking, writing, and acting as an obviouslystill-egocentric being who isjust as obviously not One with the OU. The classic example of this is once againAleisterCrowley, who defined the grade of Magister Templi (8)=[3] to identify aninitiate who hadsuccessfully achieved this OU dissolution of consciousness, then went on todefine the highergrade of Magus (9)=[2] as characterizing a magician of sufficient will and powerto force achange in that same OU. This is a clearly impossible achievement if one isalreadyindistinguishable from that OU.Hence it is a postulate of the Temple of Set that the attainment of MagisterTempli (8)=[3]is the end of the line for a true follower of the RHP. If he truly destroys hispsychecentricconsciousness and attains nirvana, he becomes something akin to the prototypicalTibetan orChristian monk - a simple, childlike, unemotional, unegotistical animal who nomore thinks ofdisturbing the OU than does an otter or a Sequoia redwood. He has, as it were,become the Tao.Those who claim attainment to Magus display either (a) a fallback to a state ofpsychecentrism, hence a lower RHP grade, or (b) their de facto adherence to theLHP. Since theobject of the LHP is to strengthen and exalt the psychecentric consciousness assomethingdistinct from the OU, the characteristic action of a Magus V° is indeed a markof uniqueinitiatory success.Similarly, a Magister Templi IV° of the LHP is one who gains total Understandingof the OUfrom an external, personal point of perspective - and who complements this witha similarly-total Understanding of his own SU.Many self-proclaimed gurus of the RHP are not inclined to adopt simple,pastoral, self-effacing, redwood-tree lifestyles. Rather they preen themselves by assumingregalia, offices, and- 190 -wealth dazzling to devotees, while insisting that such luxuries are theirrightful due preciselybecause they have set such a good example in no longer caring for them. Ifconfronted with theglaring hypocrisy of such positions, they retreat behind a smokescreen ofreligious mystery,mystical ambiguity, and “initiatory” secrecy. If in positions of sufficientpower, they persecute,imprison, torture, and/or kill their critics.The RHP societies which are of interest to the Temple are those which, whetheraccidentallyor deliberately, have broadened the knowledge-base of Black Magic. Almost everyconventionalreligion of serious historical consequence falls into this category, as each hasworked out variouspsychological approaches to the “human equation” to explain it, indoctrinate it,and/or controlit. The Setian is accordingly invited to approach the subject of comparativereligious philosophyas a most useful tool.Certain religious or occult bodies took a more-or-less deliberate jump in thedirection ofmagic. Some of the more notable of these - professing the RHP - are discussed inCategories #4,#9, and #10 of the Temple of Set Reading List (Appendix #12). You do not have tobe an expert"},{"pageContent":"on any of them to be a competent Black Magician, but you should know enoughabout theirparticular fields of research to consult their histories, writings, and recordsas they may be usefulto your own interests and endeavors.Does the Temple of Set view itself as being in competition with or in diametricopposition tothe RHP? No. We consider ourselves as magicians who have a clear understandingof what weare doing, why it works, and where we would like to go with it. We assess theRHP as being atbest innocently confused and at worst hypocritically deceitful on all threecounts. It is abehavioral phenomenon of natural humanity. It is not dangerous because of itsesoteric wisdom,but rather because of its occasional, animalistic fits of exoteric unwisdom. TheBlack Magiciantreats it as one does any other dangerous, primitive, emotional animal; he viewsit from adistance, where he may learn from it and appreciate its beauty while remainingprudently out ofreach of its teeth and claws.E. Initiatory Degrees of the Temple of SetThe Temple of Set defines initiation in terms of six formal degrees. They are:Setian I°,Adept II°, Priest or Priestess of Set III°, Magister or Magistra Templi IV°,Magus or Maga V°,and Ipsissimus or Ipsissima VI°.This is not a simple progression for the “typical” Setian to use as a barometerof success.While each degree has certain connections with the others - which accounts fortheir integrationinto a single system - each degree is also a thing unto itself: a state of beinghighly distinct fromthose above and below it. Hence a Priest III° is not simply “3/4 a MagisterIV°”, nor can the IV°be attained merely by becoming very good at the work of the III°.Here the parable of the horse and the cart may be cited: One cannot fix on the“glamor” ofinitiation - the formalized degree - as a goal and expect to get anywhere. Evenif the trappings areacquired through “ticket-punching” and the projection of anartificially-impressive image, boththe individual and the awarding agency will ultimately feel contempt for thefarce in which theyhave been participating.Rather the individual must strive to awaken to, comprehend, and actualize all ofthe powerslatent within his intelligence and psychecentric being. As he accomplishes this,true initiationtakes place - whether or not it is formally recognized by an external agency.Because the Templeof Set is composed of initiates who understand this principle, however, trueinitiation isrecognized and formalized by official designations on a Temple-wide basis. Hencethe term“Recognizing” of degrees rather than “awarding” or “conferring”.- 191 -F. Ancestry and Evolving Definition of the Grade>Degree TitlesThe titular structure of the Temple of Set’s degree system dates back to theHermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn, a turn-of-the-century Cabalistic/Egyptian magical societythat flourished inBritain. 80 [See reading list category #10.] The grades (as they were thencalled) of the G.'.D.'.were:GradeSephirah AttributionNeophyte (0)=[0][None]Zelator (1)=[10]MalkuthTheoricus (2)=[9]YesodPracticus (3)=[8]HodPhilosophus (4)=[7]NetzachAdeptus Minor (5)=[6]TipharethAdeptus Major (6)=[5]GeburahAdeptus Exemptus (7)=[4] ChesedMagister Templi (8)=[3]BinahMagus (9)=[2]ChokmahIpsissimus (10)=[1]KetherThis elevenfold system was keyed to a Hebrew Cabalistic concept known as the“Tree ofLife”. According to the Cabala, the Universe and all of its contents derive froma manifestation ofGod termed Ain Soph Aour, the Infinite or Limitless Light. Issuing from thissource are tenemanations or Sephiroth, being progressively coarser or more materialisticmanifestations ofGod. As the G.'.D.'. initiate ascends from one level of mental existence toanother, then, hesupposedly is that much closer to the purely spiritual existence of God.The G.'.D.'. grades of Zelator through Philosophus were concerned with anunderstandingand mastery of the “elemental” forces governing the physical plane. The threeAdeptus grades -which collectively comprised the Second Order of the G.'.D.'. (the Order of theRed Rose andGolden Cross) - raised the initiate to spiritual levels of apprehension. Thegrades of MagisterTempli through Ipsissimus were considered Astral grades beyond incarnated humanmanifestation; hence none of the three G.'.D.'. leaders (Westcott, Mathers,Woodman) professeda claim to them. As Dr. F.I. Regardie observed in The Golden Dawn:It is impossible for the ordinary individual to understand those above the gradeof AdeptusMinor, and individuals who lay claim to such exalted grades, by that very actplace a giganticquestion mark against the validity of their attainment. He that exalted ishumble. And to havetasted that which is conveyed by the Adeptus Minor grade is so lofty anexperience that few intheir right minds, unless they were extremely saintlike in character, wouldconsiderthemselves as having passed officially to a higher spiritual state.It is perhaps more to the point to say that the criteria for advancing even tothe SecondOrder were such a confusing and inconsistent mixture of Cabalism and OsirianEgyptianmythology that any sort of objective evaluation of one’s initiatory level becameimpossible.Grade-promotion within the G.'.D.'. thus became largely a matter of politics andpersonal80 Priest Leon Wild notes that the Golden Dawn’s grade titles were adapted byone of its founders, Dr WynnWestcott, from the elder Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (founded by RobertLittle in 1866), which in turn hadadapted them from the Gold und Rosenkreuz, a Prussian occult society (founded1757?). Cf. Christopher McIntosh,The Rose Cross and the Age of Reason: Eighteenth-Century Rosicrucianism inCentral Europe and ItsRelationship to the Enlightenment. Brill Academic Publishers, 1997, ISBN:9004095020.- 192 -favoritism, with the undergoing of initiatory rituals and the memorizing ofcorrespondingesoteric trivia being a secondary consideration.After breaking with the G.'.D.'., Aleister Crowley determined to purify itsgrade system inhis Astrum Argentum ([Order of the] Silver Star). He described the A.'.A.'.system in anappendix to Magick entitled “One Star in Sight”. It was a change from theG.'.D.'. concept onlyinsofar as it was redesigned to coincide with the concepts of initiation setforth in the Book of theLaw. Certain grade names were added or altered, and there was a generallessening of “pure”Cabalistic emphasis:The Order of the Star called S.S. is, in respect of its existence upon theEarth, an organizedbody of men and women distinguished among their fellows by the qualities hereenumerated.They exist in their own Truth, which is both universal and unique. They move inaccordancewith their own Wills, which are each unique yet coherent with the universalwill.They perceive (that is, understand, know, and feel) in love, which is bothunique anduniversal.The order consists of eleven grades or degrees and is numbered as follows. Thesecompose3 groups: the Orders of the S.S., of the R.C., and of the G.D. respectively.THE ORDER OF THE SILVER STARIpsissimus (10)=[1]Magus (9)=[2]Magister Templi (8)=[3]THE ORDER OF THE ROSY CROSS(Babe of the Abyss - the link)Adeptus Exemptus (7)=[4]Adeptus Major (6)=[5]Adeptus Minor (5)=[6]THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN(Dominus Liminis - the link)Philosophus (4)=[7]Practicus (3)=[8]Zelator (2)=[9]Neophyte (1)=[10]Probationer (0)=[0](These figures have special meanings to the initiated and are commonly employedtodesignate the grades.)The general characteristics and attributions of these Grades are indicated bytheircorrespondences on the Tree of Life, as may be studied in detail in the Book777.Student: His business is to acquire a general intellectual knowledge of allsystems ofattainment, as declared in the prescribed books (Appendix 1 of Magick).Probationer: His principal business is to begin such practices as he may prefer,and towrite a careful record of the same for one year.Neophyte: Has to acquire perfect control of the Astral Plane.Zelator: His main work is to achieve complete success in Asana and Pranayama. Healsobegins to study the formula of the Rosy Cross.Practicus: Is expected to complete his intellectual training, and in particularto study theQabalah.Philosophus: Is expected to complete his moral training. He is tested indevotion to theOrder.- 193 -Dominus Liminis: Is expected to show mastery of Pratyahara and Dharana.Adeptus (without): Is expected to perform the Great Work and to attain theKnowledgeand Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.Adeptus (within): Is admitted to the practice of the formula of the Rosy Crosson enteringthe College of the Holy Ghost.Adeptus (Major): Obtains a general mastery of practical Magick, though withoutcomprehension.Adeptus (Exemptus): Completes in perfection all these matters. He then either(a)becomes a Brother of the Left Hand Path or (b) is stripped of all hisattainments and ofhimself as well, even of his Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes a Babe of theAbyss, who,having transcended the Reason, does nothing but grow in the womb of its mother.It thenfinds itself a -Magister Templi (Master of the Temple): whose functions are fully described inLiber418, as is this whole initiation from Adeptus Exemptus. See also “Aha!” Hisprincipal businessit to tend his “garden” of disciples and to obtain a perfect understanding ofthe Universe. He isa Master of Samadhi.Magus: Attains to wisdom, declares his law [see Liber I vel Magi, and is aMaster of allMagick in its greatest and highest sense.Ipsissimus: Is beyond all this and beyond all comprehension of those of lowerdegrees.The grade system of the A.'.A.'. was the one known to Anton Szandor LaVey whenheinstituted the degrees of the Church of Satan. Following the founding of theChurch, he hadassumed the degree of Magus, but it was not until the year V/1970 that a full,formal system wasintroduced.The Church of Satan rejected the Cabalistic concept of initiation altogether. InVII/1972 andagain in X/1975 I wrote the official descriptions of the degrees for the ClovenHoof newsletter.Abridged from the latter article:Satanist I°: When the Church accepts an applicant, it permits the extension ofits power,influence, and reputation to that person. Because the majority of Satanistspursue personalinterests not directly connected with the Church organization, the I° - whichgrantsmembership benefits but entails no reciprocal responsibilities - is ideal forthem. In thiscontext it is an end in itself and should not be regarded as merely a “training”degree. The titleof the degree serves to emphasize this; one is either a Satanist or one is not.Witch or Warlock II°: While the I° implies the Church’s acceptance ofendorsement bya certain individual, it does not certify the Church’s reciprocal endorsement ofthat individualas an effective and accomplished Satanic magician. When we do make such anevaluation anddecide that the Satanist in question is adept at comprehending and utilizing thecontents ofthe Satanic Bible, the II° is granted. In one sense the II° is the highestrecognition possiblewithin a true Satanic order, because Satanism is characterized by diversity ofindividualtechnique. Once the Church is satisfied that a certain member is a capablemagician, that is allthat need be said.Priest or Priestess of Mendes III°: In other churches the priest or minister issimply asemiprofessional or professional organizer, demagogue, and ringmaster. He isalso consideredto be a shepherd, charged with the moral and spiritual guidance of his flock.The Satanic Priestis altogether different in concept. He is chosen for ordination not by otherhumans, but by thePowers of Darkness, who accentuate his characteristics and achievements in sucha fashion asto identify him as Elect to the Council of Nine. Once declared Elect by theNine, an individualhas the choice to accept or reject formal ordination. If he declines, he retainsfull control of hisWill and continues normal existence. Should he accept, he will find that hislife will be warpedin unforeseen and often strange directions, as the Powers of Darkness actualizethe Will of OurLord Satan through him. Simultaneously he will come to wield powers that willpermit noobstacle to stand before him. The Satanic Priesthood takes its name from theancient EgyptianPriesthood of Set, which was centered in the vicinity of Mendes ( Ba-neb-tett)and Tanis duringthe latter days of the empire.- 194 -Magister IV°: This degree is conferred by the High Priest in one of threedesignations:Master of the Cavern (Magister Caverni), Master of the Temple (Magister Templi),or GrandMaster (Magister Magnus). The degree and designations refer to the recipient’sexpertise andscope of magical influence.Magus V°: This is the highest degree conferred within the authority of theMandate of theChurch of Satan, reflecting the Will of the Prince of Darkness himself.Presently it is held onlyby Anton Szandor LaVey. Like the IV°, the V° is a measure of an individual andnot thedesignation of an organizational function.My first policy statement as High Priest of Set concerning the degree system ofthe Templeof Set was contained in a July 15, X/1975 letter to the founding membership,abridged as follows:As I have said or written to several of you individually, the true degrees areproperlyneither “rewards” for past achievements nor “incentives” for future ones. Ratherthey are aform of recognition of an individual’s position at a point in time. This conceptapplies to allfive degrees.In the Church of Satan degrees I°-III° were conferred by Anton Szandor LaVey,either withor without the aid of a formal, written test or questionnaire. The IV° wasconferred by himwithout any guidelines at all. The V° he assumed, being justified in doing so bythe InfernalMandate.The Temple of Set will operate differently. It is my feeling that any person whois rightfullya III° has the judgment to recognize a I° or II° individual, and thereforeshould be empoweredto do so. Persons may join the Temple as Setians I° directly through theExecutive Director,but no I° will be able to advance to IIůnless he has interacted with a III°+ anddemonstratedto that official that he is deserving of the higher degree.The same holds true for the III°, except that it will now be IV° officials whoperform theevaluation. A IV° should be able to recognize a person who is Elect to thePriesthood. Thecriteria are both too complex and too subtle to be encapsulated into any writtenexamination.The same again holds true for the IV°, with one difference in that the HighPriest, uponmaking a IV° Recognition, must secure confirmation from the Council of Nine.The concept of the I° today is the same as it was in X/1975. Such informationand resourcesas the Temple has to offer are placed at the disposal of the new Setian, andusing both these andother tools he or she is expected to take the initiative to become an Adept inthe Black Arts. Nostandardized criteria are used by the Priesthood in performing II° evaluations,since “every manand every woman is a star” and thus will apply the Art in a different manner.It remains necessary for an aspiring Setian to seek out compatible contacts fromamong thePriesthood, so that his or her achievements can be known and appreciated forwhat they are.Here the initiative for contact is decidedly the responsibility of the I°, andIII°s will expect to becontacted for advisory and evaluative purposes. Priests and Priestesses III° whoare available forcontact are included in the Temple of Set’s “Pool of Neheh” Internet forum.An Adept II° is Recognized by the Temple of Set as a competent Black Magician.Thisstatement is never made lightly. Like an academic or professional degree, theII° signifies not somuch the passing of examinations as the “licensing” of the recipient to practicethe Art in aknowledgeable, ethical, and professional manner. Unlike the I°, in which one mayremain nolonger than two years, there is no time limit for II° Temple affiliation. It isexpected that themajority of Setians will hold the II° for Earthly life.II°s, like I°s, partake of the benefits and services of the Temple and have noreciprocalobligations save to respond promptly and courteously to contacts from thePriesthood. TheTemple of Set remains committed to individualism, and it deliberately avoidsintrusions into theprerogatives, interests, or privacy of the I°/II° membership. Reciprocally it isassumed that I°/II°Initiates will conduct their lives and personal affairs in such a way as not tojeopardize thedignity and ethical reputation of the Temple.- 195 -For the Church of Satan’s degree system, Anton LaVey deliberately chose themedieval-sounding “Witch/Warlock” designation for the II° rather than the moreesoteric-sounding“Adept”. Part of the reason for this was LaVey’s preference for the colorfulimagery of traditionalSatanism, but he was also wary of being tainted by thegoody-two-shoes/Cabalistic connotationsof white-light “adeptships”.The Temple of Set, in searching for the single term most descriptive of the II°,ultimatelyconcluded that “Adept” was it. Like the Church of Satan, we see no reason forhalf-a-dozenvariations on this title; one either is Adept in the Black Arts or one is not.Thus you could saythat, as compared to the A.'.A.'. system, the transition between the Temple ofSet’s I° and II°would correspond to a transition between the (1)=[10] and (7)=[4]. Obviouslythis is not asudden transition, but the Temple of Set feels that any sort of graduatedsubdivision of theprocess, as in the G.'.D.'. and A.'.A.'., is not relevant ti our situation. AsAdeptship in the BlackArts is non-standardized, there is no one path toward it to be incremented.As was the case during the Age of Satan (I-X), the III° is the most essentialand significantdistinction recognized by the degree system. The I° and II° are intellectualmeasurements and soconstitute a strengthening of the purely human mind to its maximum potential assuch. The III°identifies a transition from a human state of being to that of a divine being -ordained by,consecrated by, and sacred to Set. The IV°-VI° are characterized by certainadditional attributes,but none of them approaches the III° distinction in essential sublimity andsanctity.Just as the II° represents the height of personal identity, and glory to betaken in thatidentity via application of the Black Arts, so the Priesthood involves theopening of a very specialkind of door: the merging of the consciousness, indeed the personality, withthat of the Prince ofDarkness himself. In this working the Priest or Priestess in no sense losespersonal identity orself-awareness; rather one’s consciousness is augmented, energized, andstrengthened by that ofSet. Hence the Priest or Priestess - when acting as such, for “Priesthood” is adeliberate act, notan office - is something more than human, something more than the individualwhose humanvisage appears before onlookers. At such times he or she is not “possessed”, butis rather becomea veritable living Temple indwelled by the presence of Set.It is impossible to overemphasize how alien this concept of Priesthood is fromthat ofconventional religions, in which it is merely a paid profession and/orbureaucratic function forthe promulgation of various institutions calling themselves “religions”. AsBlack Magic isproperly a tool for use by magicians, so the Temple of Set as an institution isultimately a vehiclefor the identification and formalization of the Priesthood of Set, through whosesouls flow thecurrent of the Æon of Set. Each Priest and Priestess of Set is a Temple of Set:a psyche sopurified, educated, consecrated, and initiated that it has become a fit mediumfor the Prince ofDarkness. Nowhere is this more succinctly illustrated than in the ultimateadmonition of theEgyptian sage to Her-Bak, at the culmination of the latter’s initiation as aPriest:O Her-Bak. O Egypt. You are the temple which the Neter of Neters inhabits.AwakenHim ... then let the temple fall crashing.It is difficult to describe degrees beyond the III° for I°/II° Initiates withoutresorting tospecialized terminology intelligible primarily within the Priesthood.Ultimately, to fullyUnderstand one of these degrees is to be deserving of Recognition to same. Somegeneralcharacteristics, however, may be discussed.These and their preliminaries are usually attributed to the Hermetic Order ofthe GoldenDawn (G.'.D.'.) in turn-of-the-20th-century London. 81 The G.'.D.'. neverconferred the three81 Nevertheless they go back considerably farther. See Section #F & notes above.- 196 -senior grades (as they were called), reserving them to themysterious/supernatural “SecretChiefs”; they were thus held to be “astral” grades beyond incarnated humanattainment.When Aleister Crowley founded his G.'.D.'.-superseding A.'.A.'. in 1907, he madeit possiblefor incarnates to attain the astral by a process of consciousness-transformationto which hereferred as “crossing the Abyss”. Now the grade of Magister Templi (8)=[3] cameinto focus ascharacterizing one capable of completely comprehending (“Understanding”) an æon.A Magus(9)=[2] identifies one who creates (“Utters the Word of”) a completely new æon,or whosignificantly expands or enhances apprehension of an existing one.So far so good, but Crowley left Ipsissimus (10)=[1] floundering in vagueness:“It is beyondall this and beyond all comprehension of those of lower degrees.” 82 In 1979,however, I finallyrealized not only the significance but what James Thomson in his City ofDreadful Night somagnificently named the “necessity supreme” of the degree of Ipsissimus VI°.The Utterance of a Word of a Magus, by introducing a principle beyond theuniverse knownto the Masters of the Temple, creates a situation of disequilibrium and kineticenergy. As theUtterance continues, so does this destabilization of the magical andphilosophical environment.Left unresolved, this atmosphere can result in the extremes of either thecomplete overwhelmingand suppressing of the status quo [as for example in history’s most drasticrevolutionaryepisodes] or in growing resistance to the “irritation” and its sometimes-violentrejection andsuppression.What is needed, therefore, is a perspective and influence beyond that of aMagus, with thepurpose of blending and synthesizing the old and the new into a harmonious andviable whole.In this sense the initiation of an Ipsissimus is the resolution of the tensionbetween the initiationof a Master of the Temple and that of a Magus.Just as the other degrees of initiation had within the Temple of Set evolvedsignificantly fromtheir Church of Satan and earlier definitions, so it was now with this one.“Ipsissimus” was originally nothing more than a superlative of the early Latinpronoun ipsus(“self”), which as ipsissimus would approximately mean “utmost self”. In the19th century thiscurious term was adopted by Britain’s Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn toreplace theoriginal name (“Jesus”) of the eleventh degree of its predecessor organization,the SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia. Presumably the G.'.D.'. thought “Ipsissimus” a bit lessblasphemous,while still implying that such an individual, associated with the highest of theSephiroth ofKether (“Crown”) on the Jewish Cabalistic “Tree of Life”, could have attained asort of “supremeselfhood”. Since none of the organization’s original members claimed any gradebeyond that ofAdeptus Exemptus (7)=[4], they felt no need to discuss it much beyond founder W.WynnWestcott’s official History Lecture:... But the highest of all in this ancient scheme are the Great Rulers of thewhole system whoseverally govern and sustain the Third Order, which includes three MagicTitles83 of Honour andSupremacy. These represent the Supernal Triad84 of the Sephiroth and areshrouded andunapproachable to the profane and to all others but the Chiefs of the Adepti ...When Crowley adopted the G.'.D.'. grades for his successor A.'.A.'., heendeavored to make“Ipsissimus” somewhat more explicit. In One Star in Sight he elaboratedconcerning this(10)=[1] grade:82 Crowley, Aleister, “One Star In Sight” , Magick (New York: Weiser, 1994).83 Magister Templi, Magus, Ipsissimus.84 Binah, Chokmah, Kether.- 197 -There is also an account in a certain secret document to be published whenproprietypermits. 85 Here it is only said this: The Ipsissimus is wholly free from alllimitations soever,existing in the nature of all things without discriminations of quantity orquality between them.He has identified Being and not-Being and Becoming, action and non-action andtendency toaction, with all other such triplicities, not distinguishing between them inrespect of anyconditions, or between any one thing and any other thing as to whether it iswith or withoutconditions.He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to expressits nature in wordand deed, but to withdraw Himself at once within the veils of his naturalmanifestation as a man,and to keep silence during his human life as to the fact of his attainment, evento the othermembers of the Order.The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that is,his being isentirely free from internal or external necessity. His work is to destroy alltendencies to constructor to cancel such necessities. He is the Master of the Law of Unsubstantiality (Anatta).The Ipsissimus has no relation as such with any Being: He has no will in anydirection, and noConsciousness of any kind involving duality, for in Him all is accomplished; asit is written“beyond the Word and the Fool, yea, beyond the Word and the Fool”.The problem with this definition is that it cancels itself out, making“Ipsissimus” ameaningless term and/or state of personal being. Indeed associating it with theBuddhist anatta(“no-self”) removes any sort of individual, personal identity altogether. 86The most that can be said for the Golden Dawn/Crowley approach is that indiscussing the“Third Order” (the three highest Sephiroth) they assumed that they were talkingabout initiatedbeings progressively closer to the universal mind and oneness of [the Hebrew]God; and thecloser you get, the more your personality dissolves into his. Theoretically thisis in keeping withthe goal of the “Right-Hand Path” of initiation.But according to Setian “Left-Hand Path” philosophy, such dissolution of thepsyche is notonly undesirable but indeed impossible, because there is no universalconsciousness such asYHVH; there is only nonconscious universal existence, balance, and consistency.Thus to us thethree highest degrees of initiation have a distinctly different, and very real,significance.It is the initiation of a Master of the Temple (Magister/Magistra Templi IV°) togain anUnderstanding of the universe of conscious thought as it presently exists.Magically this isreferred to as the current “æon”, being the most sophisticated and comprehensiveof acontinually-unfolding series of philosophical perspectives on reality. Onceattained to thisUnderstanding, the Master can then guide less-advanced initiates in ways alongtheir personalquests that are enhanced, not obstructed by the overall environment.Occasionally beyond the initiation of a Master is that of a Magus/Maga, who ischaracterizedby the introduction of a new factor into this existing philosophical universe,sufficiently potentand significant as to evoke change to its very core. In traditional magicalterminology the Magus“Utters a Word” to set this dynamic in motion; although the full factor requiresoften quitedetailed explanation and elaboration, it can be encapsulated, symbolized by asingle term - suchas Agape, Anatta, Agathon, Thelema (of the Æon of Horus), Indulgence (of the Ageof Satan),and Xeper, Xem, Runa, Remanifest, and Arkte (of the Æon of Set to date).85 Crowley is referring to his 1921 diary, The Magical Record of the Beast 666,wherein he wrote of taking the Oathof Ipsissmus on May 23.86 Anatta is one of the more elusive and controversial concepts in Buddhism.Generally-accepted definitions of ittend to leave the reader even more confused! I would summarize it as theproposition that there is no isolate,unique, and immortal psyche such as the Egyptians, Plato, and the Temple of Setpostulate. Rather, so the Buddhasaid, what people think of as their “soul” is an ever-changing “rain” ofimpressions upon their bodily senses fromwithin and without the physical body, creating the illusion of a self. Thusthere is no conscious immortality,although there is natural, all-inclusive perpetuity.- 198 -So intensely and obsessively does the Magus identify with the Uttered Word thatit in effectbecomes a personal universe, outside of which reality is unintelligible andinadequate. To othersa Magus driven by this vision may seem inexplicable, irrational, even insane.This phenomenonis “the Curse of the Magus” - that is not to be Understood even by nearbyInitiates ofUnderstanding!It is into this conflict that the initiation of Ipsissimus/Ipsissima becomes notonly necessarybut, in Thomson’s phrase, supremely so. It is the function of an Ipsissimus tocomprehend thegreater synthesis of an Uttered Word with the collective æonic totalitypreceding it, and todelicately encourage and enhance that synthesis. Characteristically this isundertaken with suchsubtlety that the will and action of the Ipsissimus pass completely unnoticed,and this is as itshould be if the harmonizing is to be perfectly fulfilled.Beyond this the Ipsissimus also confronts the still-intersecting “ripples” ofmany æonsactivated at various points in history, and performs workings to enable them tocomplement andimprove, not clash with and destroy one another.As the Priesthood constitutes a merging of the individual soul with that of Set,so theMagistry constitutes an expansion of that merger to a full apprehension of theÆon of Set. TheMaster knows not only the consciousness of Set, but the reach of thatconsciousness and theresultant view of creation and existence it embraces. All particular phenomenaare evaluated,placed, and balanced within the continuum of the Æon by the Master, and suchadjustments inevents as the Master makes are for Æonic purposes - some of which may be obscureor evenimperceptible to those below this degree.Setians interacting with Masters of the Temple are tempted to assess them merelyas“senior Priests or Priestesses”, and indeed every Master is first and foremostan Initiate of thePriesthood, invariably with a long and distinguished III° record. But the IV° isneither just anadministrative promotion nor a reward for distinguished service; it is aninitiatory state of beingin itself. Onlookers - and Masters themselves - lose sight of this at theirperil.Aleister Crowley, who felt that the grade of Magister Templi (8)=[3] was indeedattainableby incarnated humans, suggested that such attainment - the successful “crossingof the Abyss” -necessitated the annihilation of the personality and one’s absorption in theuniversalconsciousness. The fallacy of this, of course, is that an (8)=[3] continued botha particularexistence and a particular perspective. The initiate might insist that hepossessed no furtherseparateness from the cosmos, but the very act of insistence necessitates thesensation of such adistinction. A discussion of what this implies for holders of the (8)=[3]A.'.A.'. is beyond thescope of this writing.The degree of Magus - V° Temple of Set/Church of Satan, (9)=[2] A.'.A.'./G.'.D.'. -identifies a Master who has “stepped outside” the totality of the existing Æonicformula to alter itin an evolutionary way. Such alteration may result in the inauguration of a newÆon, or it mayresult in an improvement in or strengthening of the current Æon. The changeitself may bemassive or subtle; but it will invariably be alien to preexisting values andwill thus tend to beviewed skeptically or suspiciously. Implementation of the change is spoken of asthe Task of aMagus, and undertaking of such a Task amidst the resistant inertia ofpreexistence is called theCurse of a Magus.The degree of Ipsissimus - VI° Temple of Set, (10)=[1] A.'.A.'./G.'.D.'. - wastreated evasivelyby Aleister Crowley, most probably because his claim to the lower grade of Magushad alreadycaused him such difficulty. [Initiates of higher degrees soon learn to theirannoyance that aproportionate percentage of their time is devoted to defending their suitabilityfor such exaltedtitles. The temptation is to refuse to admit to them altogether, so that one mayget on with one’swork unpestered.] In any case, an Ipsissimus is essentially a “successfulMagus”: one whose Taskis complete.- 199 -Inherent in such completion is a unique perception of the new æonic inertiawhich hasresulted, placing the Ipsissimus at once within and without the æon itself. Tofunction as anIpsissimus, he must work to perfect and harmonize not only the created ormodified æon, butalso its entire relationship with preexisting and potential æons. Thus heenhances the Work ofthe Magi; thus he ensures that the Understanding of the Masters of the Temple isnot futilebecause of factors beyond the æon in which they tend their gardens.It is the Curse of a Magus not to be Understood, in that he has set out todefine andpromulgate something alien to the existing inertia of magical philosophy. It isthe doom of anIpsissimus to Understand a great many æons simultaneously: to see how they maybe exclusiveyet complementary, independent yet interrelated, sequential yet coincidental.The Initiate of any degree of the Priesthood (III°-VI°) may function in a lowerdegree thanthe highest one attained, and in fact usually does. About 90% of all Priesthoodfunctions takeplace at the III° level, with most of the remaining Work characteristic of theIV°. V° Work issharp and “surgical” in nature, and that of the VI° is usually - but not always- too subtle to benoticed.Of all the difficulties encountered by the Temple of Set - and its predecessors- since itsinception, none has caused greater damage to both the institution and theindividuals involvedthan abuses of the degree system: generally the result of rash, egotisticallunges towards whatthe ambitious person perceives simply in terms of increased social status. As Iwould hope thisessay points out, such efforts by the unqualified merely result in a handful ofair insofar as theindividual is concerned - but accompanied by the very real hazards of trying tofunction in ahyperdemanding capacity without the necessary skills to do so if one somehowsucceeds in proforma Recognition.It is the sacred purpose of the Temple to Recognize each of its Initiatescarefully,responsibly, and appropriately - and to encourage each and every Initiate toattain to his or hergreatest potential. Let us remember too that there is intentional symbolism inthe fact that allmedallions - from I° to VI° - are identical save in background color. No Setianis “better” thanany other Setian by virtue of holding a particular degree - only morewell-traveled along certainkinds of paths. The more we perceive one another as fellow-travelers withmeaningfulexperiences to communicate, the more we can maximize the very real benefits ofthe degreesystem as it was conceived to function.G. ÆonsAs far as most occultists are aware, references to æons began with AleisterCrowley’s much-advertised Æon of Horus, which he proclaimed to have followed first the Æon ofIsis (roughlypre-Christian paganism) and then that of Osiris (roughly 2,000 years ofChristianity). SinceCrowley’s understanding of Egyptian mythology was essentially that of theOsiris/Isis/Horustrinity, this tied Western civilization up into a nice, neat package.Not only was Crowley responsible for bringing about the Æon of Horus, we aretold, butthat of Osiris as well - in a previous incarnation as the High Priest of Osiris[and Priestess of Isis]Ankh-f-na-khonsu. The story of this is told in his memoir of that incarnation,“Across the Gulf”,in Equinox #I-7:But Thoth the mighty god, the wise one, with his ibis-head and his nemyss ofindigo, withhis Ateph crown and his phœnix wand and with his ankh of emerald, with his magicapron inthe three colors; yea, Thoth, the god of wisdom, whose skin is of tawny orangeas though itburned in a furnace, appeared visibly to all of us. And the old Magus of theWell, whom noman had seen outside his well for night threescore years, was found in themidst; and he criedwith a loud voice, saying, “The Equinox of the Gods!”- 200 -And he went about to explain how it was that Nature should no longer be thecenter ofman’s worship, but man himself, man in his suffering and death, man in hispurification andperfection. And he recited the Formula of the Osiris as follows, even as it hathbeentransmitted unto us by the Brethren of the Cross and Rose unto this day ...In his own writings Crowley does not indicate where he came by this concept of“æons” orexactly what is meant by it. A little detective work, however, takes us back tothe days of theGolden Dawn and the writing of a book entitled Egyptian Magic (#10I) by FlorenceFarr, Scribeof the G.'.D.'., in 1896. This book, part of a 10-volume series CollectaneaHermetica edited byW.W. Westcott, contained a very interesting chapter called “The Gnostic Magic ofEgypt”, fromwhich the following quote:Let us first consider the essential principles of Gnosticism, which are brieflyas follows:First - A denial of the dogma of a personal supreme God, and the assertion of asupremedivine essence consisting of the purest light and pervading that boundless spaceof perfectedmatter which the Greeks called the Pleroma. This light called into existence thegreat fatherand the great mother whose children were the æons or god-spirits. That is to sayfrom thesupreme issues the nous or divine mind and thence successive emanations, eachless sublimethan the preceding. The divine life in each becoming less intense until theboundary of thePleroma, or the fullness of God, is reached. From thence there comes into beinga taint ofimperfection, an abortive and defective evolution, the source of materiality andthe origin of acreated universe, illuminated by the divine but far removed from its infinitudeand perfection.Now the Gnostics considered that the actual ruler and fashioner of this createduniverseand its beings good and evil was the Demiurgos, a power issuant from sophia orwisdom. Bysome it was said that the desire of souls for progression caused the origin of auniverse inwhich they might evolve and rise to the divine.The Gnostics definitely believed in the theory of cycles of ascent and return totheevolutionary progress of worlds, ages, and man; the ascents & descents of thesoul; thepreexistence of all human souls now in worldly life; and the surety that allsouls that desire thehighest must descend to matter and be born of it. They were the philosophicalChristians.The rule of the Christian church, however, fell into the hands of those whoencouraged anemotional religion, destitute of philosophy, whose members should be boundtogether bypersonal ties of human sympathy with an exalted sufferer and preacher ratherthan by anintellectual acceptance of high truth.The Gnostics dissented from the creed then being taught, on the ground of theinferiorityof the hero-worship of Christ to the spiritual knowledge of the supernal mind,which theyconsidered he taught.The Gnostics were almost universally deeply imbued with the doctrines ofSocrates andPlato; and a religion of emotion and reverence, combined with moral platitudes,did not seemto them of a sublimity sufficiently intense to be worthy to replace thereligious mysteries ofEgypt, India, and Persia, the theocracy of the Jews, or the sublime truthshidden in the mythsof Greece.In Religion in Ancient History S.G.F. Brandon comments:In his “First Epistle to the Corinthians” Paul had occasion to contrast histeaching withthat of other systems known to his readers. In so doing he was led to give thissignificantaccount of his own: “Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet a wisdom notof thisworld, nor of the rulers of this world, which are coming to naught: but we speakGod’s wisdomin a mystery, even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordainedbefore theworlds unto our glory: which none of the rulers of this world knoweth: for hadthey known it,they would not have crucified the Lord of glory” (ii. 6-8).- 201 -In our official English translations the proper meaning of this passage isobscured at twocrucial points. The Greek word translated as “world” here, severally in itssingular or pluralforms, is aion, which does not mean this physical world or Earth, but “time” or“age”.]Paul’s use of aion here accordingly shows that he was thinking in terms of anesotericsystem of “world-ages” that probably derived ultimately from Iranian andBabylonian sources,and that in various forms was much in vogue in current Græco-Roman thought. Nextthewords translated as “rulers of this world” ( archontes tou aionos toutou) do notrefer, as ispopularly supposed, to the Roman and Jewish authorities who were responsible forcondemning Jesus to death. They denote dæmonic beings who were associated withtheplanets and believed to govern the lives of men on Earth.As Farr and Brandon both go on to observe, Gnostic Christianity was regarded asa veryserious threat to the Christian church and was intensely persecuted. Had itbecome prevalent,the 2,000 years might have evolved very differently in Western civilization -with a veryintellectual, philosophical, and initiatory religious climate instead of theintolerant, ferocious,and ignorant horror of dogmatic Christianity.Now we are beginning to see this term æon in a new light, if I may be excusedtheexpression. The Æon of Horus is not just a period of time when ideas symbolizedby Horus aredominant. Rather it is a Ding an sich, a noumenon: something of purely rationalapprehension,not perception by the senses.Thus in what one might term the LBM sense, an æon is simply an attitude whichonechooses or is conditioned to adopt. This is what is meant by saying thatdifferent people“exist in different æons”: that a Jew, Christian or Moslem exists in the Æon ofOsiris, a Wiccan inthat of Isis, and a Thelemite in that of Horus.Accordingly, while æons are “pyramidal” in sophistication, after the fashion ofPlato’s“pyramid of thought”, there is no reason to consider them time-sequential, witheach new onesuperseding and obliterating the one before it.In an LBM sense, therefore, the population of the world continues overwhelminglyin thegrip of the Æon of Osiris, the best intentions of Aiwass notwithstanding. TheÆon of Isis is thenext influential, followed by that of Horus. The Æon of Set, highest on thepyramid and mostdifficult to comprehend and indwell, is the “smallest” and most exclusive ofall.As with the degree system, it would be very difficult if not impossible to spendall of one’stime in a “higher æon”. When we go about our affairs in the profane world, weare usuallyOsirians, peering with curiosity and vague alarm at ecological activists (Isis)or avant-gardeartists (Horus). Yet we experience periods of Isis and Horus too - and, when wewish to, that veryrarefied Æon of Set.Crowley, who suggested that æons were periods of time in “catastrophicsuccession” - Ipresume in order to more forcefully advance the cause of the Æon of Horus -predicted in theEquinox #I-10 that following the ÆH “will arise the Equinox of Ma, the goddessof justice. Itmay be a hundred or ten thousand years from now (1913), for the computation oftime is nothere as there.” In 1921, in his “new comment” to Liber Legis, Crowley speculatedthat the nextæon would be that of Thmaist, third officer in the G.'.D.'. Neophyte ritual. Onthe other hand, hecontinued, “It may be presumptuous to predict any details concerning the nextæon after this.”That is essentially my attitude as well. As Magus of the Æon of Set, I am an Eyein thatparticular Triangle [or Shining Trapezohedron], as it were. The only one whoknows for certainwhat the next-conceived æon will be, if indeed there should be one, would be theMagus or Magawho Utters its word.Above I made reference to æons “in an LBM sense”. Is there a “GBM sense” aswell? Indeedthere is, but - like Her-Bak - you are going to have to reflect very carefullyupon it to apprehendit.- 202 -Seen through the lens of GBM, an æon is in fact a living entity, in which itsinitiates are“cells”. This is the secret which the Gnostics brought from antiquity, and whichso frightened theChristian dogmatists. The “god” of an æon is thus a creature of the totalmagical andphilosophical energy of material beings who are initiates of that æon, i.e. whoare aware that theyare “components of the god”. [Are you now beginning to see the ancient originsof Hegel’sconcept of an “overmind”?]Understood in this sense, a GBM working is a way of the “part’s” reaching out tocontact,experience, and/or express the “whole”. This is why true GBM is not evenremotely like “prayer”as the profane practice it. Nor is it mere meditation, in which the mind of themeditator merelyextends to its own limits. It is the greatest secret, and the greatestfulfillment, of uniqueexistence.Once an æon is apprehended in this way, a great many veils fall away, a greatmanymysteries of what magic is/ why it works are revealed, and indeed the entire“why” of humanconsciousness is explained. All you need is the noesis to perceive it. Don’t beconcerned if youdon’t attain such noesis the moment you finish your first reading of BlackMagic. It is there; andwhen you are ready for it, It will be ready for you.H. The Pentagram of SetSymbols do not represent the thing itself, the actual phenomenon. It would alsobe wrongto think that they are purely and simply schematic formulæ. In operationalresearch the modelis not a small-scale or simplified model of a known object; it is a possibleapproach to, ormeans of getting to know this object. And it is outside reality, in themathematical universe.The next requirement is that the analogical machine constructed on this modelshouldenter into an electronic trance so that it can give practical answers. This iswhy all the usualoccultist explanations of symbols are useless. They look upon symbols as if theywere schemasthat can be interpreted by intelligence at its normal level and so leadimmediately to anapprehension of reality. For centuries they have been treating in this way theSt. Andrew’scross, the swastika, and the star of Solomon, but have contributed nothing to astudy of theprofound structure of the universe.Einstein, with his sublime intelligence, was able, in a flash of illumination,to catch aglimpse of the space/time relationship, but without completely understanding orintegrating itinto his scheme of things. To communicate his discovery at an intelligiblelevel, and to helphim recapture his own illuminating vision, he drew the sign λ representing thetrihedral angle.This sign is not a schema of reality and means nothing to the mass of mankind.It is asignal, a rallying cry to all workers in the field of mathematical physics. Andyet all theprogress made in this field by the greatest intellects will only succeed indiscovering what thistrihedral symbol evokes, but will not be able to penetrate the universe wherethe law of whichthis symbol is an expression actually operates. At least, at the end of thisforward march, weshall know that this other universe exists. 87The inverse pentagram against a circular field is known as the Pentagram of Set.Thisinsignia constitutes the Seal of the Temple of Set, and it is also used toidentify the six magicaldegrees of initiatory membership.87 Pauwels, Louis & Bergier, Jacques, The Morning of the Magicians. New York:Avon, 1963.[index-203_1.jpg]- 203 -The pentagram is one of the most ancient symbols known to mankind, dating fromprehistory. 88 89 It is significant mathematically in that it precisely embodiesthe ratio Φ ( phi), asthe ratio between any longer and shorter line section within the pentagram . 9091In ancient Egypt Φ was known as the Sacred Cut. It was employed in all importantconstruction and artwork. For instance, one-half the base of the Great Pyramiddivided into theapothem equals Φ accurate to 4 significant figures. 92 93The Greeks too used Φ in art and architecture, naming it the Golden Mean orGoldenSection. 94 A “Golden Rectangle”, where the Φ ratio is equal to the relationshipbetween thelonger and shorter dimensions, appears in the works of artists Leonard da Vinci,Albrecht Dürer,and George Seurat. In 1876 Gustav Fechner, a German psychiatrist, conductedexperimentswhich concluded that the vast majority of people “preferred” rectangles in thisshape.Φ also appears in nature. Most spiral growth in nature, notably phyllotaxis (thegrowth ofleaves and flowers), follows the Fibonacci series, where each number in theseries is equal to the88 Don Webb IV°: “William Arnett’s The Predynastic Origin of EgyptianHieroglyphs (1982) shows that thepentagram existed side-by-side with the five-line star, which became common usein the protodynastic Naquadaregion (a Setian site). Five-pointed stars were found at Gerza and Tarkhan, allUpper or Middle Egyptianprotodynastic sites. The Tarkhan has a five-pointed star in a circle attached toa boat - one of the first signs of thejourney through the Tuat. Arnett dates all of these to 3500 BCE, but I suspectfor various reasons that they’re abouta thousand years earlier.”89 See Appendix #94.90 The concept and significance of Φ may be studied at length in H.E. Huntley’sThe Divine Proportion, as well as inrelated works in Reading List Category #12.91 The lines of the pentagram reflect the Golden Mean. Each inside angle of thecentral pentagon is 108°. Each insideangle of the five points is 36°. Every line segment of the pentagram divided bythe next shorter segment yields:sin 108°-------- = 1.618033988749894848204586834365638117720309180…sin 36°92 I am particularly grateful to Setian Rodney Scott of Australia for hismeticulous corrections and refinements tothe Φ-mathematics summarized in this section, as well as in the previous notesconcerning it by other Setians.93 Assuming that the base to be 440 cubits and the apothem 356 cubits, then theapothem divided by 1/2 the baseyields:356---------- = 1.6181818…440 x .594 This entire idea seems to have died with the fall of ancient Greekcivilization; it was not rediscovered until the16th century, when Lucas Picioli published Divina proportione with illustrationsby Leonardo da Vinci.- 204 -sum of the two preceding numbers, ie: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... As thisseries continues, therelationship between successive numbers approaches f. 95The Sacred Cut (or Golden Section) divides a line into unequal sections wherethe smaller isto the larger as the larger is to the whole. Similarly, a Golden Rectangle isone which, whendivided into a square and smaller rectangle, the smaller rectangle is also aGolden Rectangle. Or,algebraically, Φ2 = Φ +1. 96This, then, is the “secret” of the pentagram - a fact overlooked completely bymost occult“authorities” of history. All “magic pentangles” - generally embellished withCabalistic graffiti ofone sort or another - amount to an unconscious effort to use the innate power ofthe pentagrameven though not recognizing it for what it actually is. The pentagram as used bythe Temple ofSet is retained in its pure form, so that the beauty of Φ is undiluted andundefiled. 97It is portrayed inverse to imply change and movement in place of stasis andrest, and also toproclaim the evolutionary dialectic of thesis contrasted with antithesis toproduce synthesis -instead of a foreordained and unavoidable absolute standard.In occult tradition the inverse pentagram has also symbolized Black Magic orSatanism asopposed to the White Magic of Cabalists and polytheists, symbolized by anobverse pentagram.The Pentagram of Set is enclosed in a perfect circle (a function of π),representing themathematical order of the OU. The pentagram does not touch the circle, however,signifying thatthe Powers of Darkness are not derived from or dependent upon that order.Silver is the traditional color of the night, as gold is of the day. Inrecognition of the role ofSet as Prince of Darkness and counterpart to the [Horus] light of day, theTemple of Set casts thepentagram in silver. Silver has also signified initiatory and exclusivereligious systems asopposed to open, mass-oriented ones.The background color of each degree medallion possesses distinct significance.The colorwhite (I°) represents the newfound freedom of the mind from myths,misconceptions, anddoctrines resulting from fear and superstition.An Adept II° wears the pentagram against red. Of all the gods of ancient Egypt,Set alonewas portrayed in red, and red has also been the traditional color oflife-oriented religions; theBlood is the Life.Those who are Elect to the Priesthood of Set III° wear the Pentagram of Setagainst black,symbolizing the individual’s consecration by the Prince of Darkness.95 The Fibonacci series was named after mathematician Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci.

The Church of Satan again displayed thepentagram inverse, but onlytogether with the other symbols which comprise the Sigil of Baphomet. TheMoorish name referred to by Set isobviously the name “Baphomet”. “Khar” is the name of the Egyptian XVI Nome,whose capital was Ba-neb-tett, orMendes, and whose god-figure was the famous Goat of Mendes, notorious during thePtolemaic period of decadenceas a symbol of sensuality.- 205 -A Master of the Temple IV° wears the Pentagram of Set against blue, thetraditional color ofthe most advanced and accomplished initiates (such as the Philosopher-Kings ofPlato’s Republicor the Priest-Kings of Atlantis).A Magus V° wears the Pentagram of Set against purple, the traditional color ofroyalty,because he is distinguished from the Masters of the Temple by being Tasked bythe Prince ofDarkness with the Utterance of a Word.An Ipsissimus VI° wears the Pentagram of Set against gold. The symbolism of thiscolor isknown to the Masters of the Temple.An Honorary Setian (a non-Initiate of the Temple so designated by virtue ofdistinguishedservice to the Temple or Æon of Set) wears the Pentagram of Set against green,symbolizing thenatural universe in which the recipient dwells. In this case the Pentagram ofSet appears in gold,symbolizing the non-initiatory character of this honor.The full-size (2” diameter) medallion of the Temple of Set may be worn withformal,semiformal, or casual attire, but never with such garb as to reflect ill uponits dignity. Underceremonial circumstances Initiates of degrees I°-III° maywear it together with ablack robetrimmed in the individual’s degree-color (I°=white, II°=red, III°= silver).Initiates of degreesIV°-VI° wear either robes of the appropriate degree color or black robes trimmedin theindividual’s degree-color. III°+ Initiates may wear a black clerical collar.- 206 -[index-207_1.jpg]- 207 -And now ... the magical chapters:“Of a Neophyte, and How the Black Art Was Revealed unto Him by the Fiend Asmoel”- Aubrey Beardsley, 1893- 208 -[index-209_1.jpg]- 209 -18: MagicPoor men, most admirable, most pitiable,With all their changes all their great Creeds changeFor Man, this alien in my family,Is alien most in this, to cherish dreamsAnd brood on visions of eternity,And build religions in his brooding brainAnd in the dark depths awe-full of his soul.My other children live their little lives,Are born and reach their prime and slowly fail,And all their little lives are self-fulfilled;They die and are no more, content with ageAnd weary with infirmity. But ManHas fear and hope and phantasy and awe,And wistful yearnings and unsated loves,That strain beyond the limits of his life,And therefore Gods and Demons, Heaven and Hell:This Man, the admirable, the pitiable.- James ThomsonA Voice from the NileIt is the curse and the blessing of humanity to exist simultaneously in twoworlds: that ofthe tangible real and that of the intangible ethereal. Unlike all other animalswe are not contentwith physical life’s sensations; despite sober argument and methodical sciencewe never quitebelieve that “this is all there is” to our existence. We are drawn, some gently,as in fantasy anddream, some more insistently and passionately, to - something else, somethinggreater,something that lifts our being and our significance clear out of nature, farbeyond the realmsof atoms and molecules: an magnificent mælstrom of gods and daemons for whom“reality” isbut a poor crutch for brutes on the periphery of their much larger universe.If the mystic is content to dream about this other universe and the artist toconvey glimpsesof it in music, paint, or pen, it is the passion of the magician to interactwith it. The magicianseeks to draw its presence and power into the lesser world, to change that worldby its touch.The magician fumbles at this. There are no ordinary tools Here that he canreliably applyThere, and the great rays of the gods that flow so inexorably and thrillinglythrough “nature” arejust as elusive. They are to be glimpsed out of the corner of one’s eye,unexpectedly. Themagician struggles to fashion new and different tools for control which he, inhis semblance assentient, natural man-beast, can use reliably and repeatedly, as one would awrench or hammer.- 210 -To non-magicians his efforts may appear bewildering, even foolish. They areillogical. Theydon’t make sense. They are but “melted into thin air”. Perhaps they are evenharmful in that theyentice others into the same useless folly, draining energy which might better beput to serious,practical labor. The magician may thus find himself ignored as an irrelevanteccentric, perhapseven ostracized as someone dangerously insane.Yet he continues with his great work, his search for tools. Sometimes he thinkshe hasindeed found or fashioned just such a different kind of wrench or hammer, and hewrites downdescriptions of it and instructions for its use. Sometimes other magicians, intheir quest for tools,come across what he has written and try his ideas for themselves. And sometimesthey indeedseem to work, and so another brick has been added to the bridge between Here andThere. Let usnow examine, and perhaps venture out upon that bridge.The Temple of Set defines magic according to two general categories: White andBlack.These have precise meanings which may quite different from the way the terms arecasually usedby nonSetians. To begin with, neither category is inherently “good” or “evil”;the categoriesencompass techniques only. Either may be used for intentionally orunintentionally beneficial orharmful purposes.A. White MagicConventional religious ritual is a device for autohypnosis of the celebrant andvaryingdegrees of mass-hypnosis for the audience. The mechanical liturgies have arelaxing, dullingeffect upon the mind, placing it in the ( alpha-wave) mood most receptive to theconditioning(i.e. the sermon or other main body of the ritual).White Magic (WM) is a highly-concentrated form of such ritual. The practitionerseeks afocus of his awareness and powers of concentration via an extreme degree ofautohypnosis. Thetechnique may be used simply for meditation or entertainment through mentalimagery (“astralprojection”). Or it may be used to focus the will towards a desired end - acure, curse, etc. Toaccomplish this, the magician envisions a god or dæmon with the power to achievethe goal, thenconcentrates his will into an appeal. The god or dæmon then carries out theappeal, more or lesseffectively - depending upon the strength of the magician’s conviction of itspower as afunctioning entity. 98From a Setian perspective, all conventional religious, and nonSetian “occult”ritualism fallsunder the heading of WM. Intrinsically it is inauthentic and impotent. Its powerderives ratherfrom what it gets people to believe and do when it is used as a psychologicalindividual- or mass-control device. Thus, for instance, any sort of advertising or propaganda is anapplication of WM,though neither users nor targets may [and probably wouldn’t] employ that term.B. Black MagicBlack Magic (BM) involves no autohypnosis or conditioning of the mind to make itreceptive to induced imagery. Thus, unlike White Magic, it is not an exercise inself-deception.Rather it is a deliberate and conscious effort to force the mind outward - toutilize and/or eitherperceptively or actually alter the “laws” of the Objective Universe (OU).Thus it is an action to “commit the same crime against God (= OU consistency)”as did thePrince of Darkness: to place one’s self deliberately apart and distinct from theOU.98 Crowley, Aleister, Magick, pages #151-284. LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Bible,pages #110-152; The SatanicRituals, pages #15-27.- 211 -Black Magic has two principal subcategories: Lesser (LBM) and Greater (GBM).These aredetailed in the next two chapters. Following these is a third chapter dealingwith their blending,Medial (MBM).Ideally the magician should never use GBM when MBM will suffice, MBM when LBMwillsuffice, nor LBM when intelligent, conventional actions will suffice. Much ofthe effectiveness ofmagic is due to its exclusiveness, its esoteric glamor. To overuse it, or to useit for vulgarpurposes, is to cheapen it. One does not use fine china to serve hot dogs forlunch. Keep magicsomething special in your life; consider it a sacrament and a testament to theeternal majesty ofyour soul. Then you will find that it will dignify and sanctify your being, andwill raise you aboveprofane humanity. To echo Pythagoras: “Thou shalt be an immortal god, divine, nolongermortal.”C. The Call of the Fire; The Warning of NootMagic is the operative aspect of initiation. It is an entirely new way ofcomprehending anddefining yourself and entities/things not-yourself. As a magician you are nolonger the slave ofan imposed, inescapable reality; you exist in multiple realities, some of whichyou use yourwisdom and skills to expertly navigate, others of which you create and controlyourself. Suchexperiences and ventures can be simple or complex, permanent or temporary. Youwill be able tochange some of them in whole or part; some of them will also be able to changeyou in whole orpart.“You have just taken your first step,” Obi-wan Kenobi said to Luke Skywalker inStar Wars,“into a larger universe.” By seeking out the Temple of Set, you have taken asimilar first step.That first step is to become aware that initiation exists and that you canpursue it if you wish.But before you take that second step, you need to reflect upon its consequences.Like eatingof the fruit of the forbidden tree in the fabled Garden of Eden, it is a stepwhich cannot beundone. Once you decide to be an initiate and a magician, you will have foreverevolved beyondnatural-animal existence.This realization and choice have been the subject of many legends andillustrationsthroughout humanity’s many eras and cultures. One of the most poignant was thestory ofAyesha, Priestess of Isis, as related by herself in H. Rider Haggard’s Wisdom’sDaughter. Guidedthroughout her life by the sage Noot to accept her human discipleship of thatneter of the naturalorder, Ayesha was finally entrusted with the guardianship of a Flame whichpossessed the powerto transform anyone who stepped within it to personal divinity. What was notevident was theinescapability of creative definition, and the absolute loneliness in exercisingit, which authenticgodhood entails. Warned Noot:Yonder fire will not destroy the mortal who finds the courage to stand in itsraging path;it will give him life, and with it such strength, such beauty, and such wisdomas have neverbeen the lot of man born of woman. Also it will give him such passions, suchdespairs, suchunending woes as hitherto no mortal heart has known.There is the truth. Ask me not how it comes into my keeping and what that voicemay bewhich is speaking it through my lips. A minute gone this truth was mine alone.Now it is yoursalso, and being yours, I pray to that Divine from which we come and whither wereturn again,that it may give you strength and the true wisdom, knowing all, to reject all,and turning asidefrom this glittering guerdon of enduring life, patiently to walk your human pathto the endappointed to our human feet.Ultimately Ayesha heeded the call of the Fire and in its embrace was transformedinto She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, immortal and omnipotent, with a beauty such that none couldlook upon- 212 -her without succumbing to madness. Veiled, she endured countless centuries amongthosewhose human dullness enabled them to find the simple natural pleasures andcontentments thatwere now intolerable to her.This is the danger of magic: that it will make you what you envision yourself tobecome, andempower you to see through and beyond all human illusions. Also that, as Ayeshaalsodiscovered, once attained, it is not reversible. Give careful thought to Noot’swarning, therefore,before you too enter the Flame. Because if you do, there is no turning back: notjust for the spanof a human life, but forever.[index-213_1.jpg][index-213_2.jpg]- 213 -19: Lesser Black MagicThese aren’t the droids you’re looking for.- Obi-wan Kenobi, Star WarsLesser Black Magic (LBM) is the influencing of beings, processes, or objects inthe Objective Universe (OU) by the application of obscure physical or behaviorallaws.LBM can function either by compelling something to happen (the selection andactivationof enforcing OU laws either established, obscure, or still-experimental) or byimpelling it tohappen (using a mixture of non-enforcing laws to maximize the desired result’sprobability).A. Stage MagicLBM operations may target either OU components and events per se, or moreusually andeasily human perception and interpretation of them. At the level ofentertainment, such controlof perceptions is commonly known as “stage magic”, and an overview of itsprinciples is a goodway to comprehend the mechanism of LBM generally.Stage magic, as studied and employed by professional magicians, consists notonly of stageprops and physical dexterity, but also of misdirection, deception, and sensorypreemption. Theeffect is to make the seemingly-impossible happen, right before the eyes of anastonishedaudience.Less ethically and benignly, these same techniques have been used by confidencemen tosting their marks, by generals to overcome their enemies, by religious leadersto sway thecredulous, and by politicians to get elected to office. In their usual sequenceof application, theyare:1. Either control of the environment or adaptation of the magic to it. Only thesimplest “table tricks” of magic can be done without regard to theirsurroundings. Formost illusions to be effective, the complete environment in which they areactivatedmust be controlled: lighting, absence or presence of external noise, intentionaldistractions from close attention, audience alertness and receptiveness. Whileanillusion is intended to appear spontaneous, it frequently requires carefuladvancepreparation out of view of the eventual audience.- 214 -2. Establishment of the magician’s dominant relationship. The magician displaysa persona - dress, assertive speech, body language, pressured pace, eye contact-designed to seize and hold the attention of the audience, as well as togradually butinexorably replace their wills and judgment of reality with his own. [This isparticularlyessential to hypnotism.]3. Dictation of the applicable elements. The magician identifies to the audiencewhatobjects, locations, and/or procedures are important and essential, restrictingtheproblem to their interaction exclusively. The consequence of this is that anobject’sbehavior which might seem unremarkable or contrived against ordinary backgroundsorpoints of reference becomes surprising and inexplicable in this artificialenvironment.4. Definition of the variables. An object or procedure may be used in any numberofways, but the magician defines them so as to limit these ways to only thosewhich makepossible and reinforce the illusion.5. Instruction of behavior. Audience participation is desirable, since goingthroughmotions to supposedly produce the illusion suggests to the audience that it issomewhatresponsible for it, thus encouraging belief in it.6. Limitation of possibilities. As he controls all of the object(s) andprocedure(s)variables, the magician can force the outcome of the illusion into one which theequally-predetermined alternatives appear to highlight as miraculous.7. Channeling of expectations. Once in control of both the elements of theillusion andthe audience’s perceptions and willpower, the magician instructs the audience inwhatthe possible outcomes of the illusion can be. It is now “impossible” for theobjects orprocedures to function in any other way, nor for the audience to devise orconsider one.8. Interpretation of the result. Once the illusion is produced, the magicianmakes itclear to the audience what it “obviously” signifies. As in his initialestablishment ofcontrol over the audience, he now implants - though announcement, emotionalsurprise/satisfaction, and body language - their presumedly “spontaneous”reaction.9. Reinforcement of controlled perceptions. As necessary to establish theperformed illusion firmly in “reality”, the magician follows it up with as manysupporting devices and created impressions as are necessary.Beyond these basics LBM is most specifically concerned with the stage magicaldiscipline ofmentalism. This involves diversion of target audience perceptions andinterpretations towardsa different interpretation of their own thought processes than the one whichthey wouldnaturally experience.This is accomplished both through the above-listed techniques of magic and,wherepossible, appropriate activation and blending of external psychological controlmechanisms inorder to not only reconfigure the subject’s thought-processes, but to leaveundisturbed his beliefthat absolutely no such external influence is occurring. 9999 Cf. my 2013/16 book MindWar for a detailed description of several suchmechanisms, or “PSYCONs”.- 215 -B. Individual and Group AnalysisIn addition to their basic personalities and logical thought processes, allpersons have likes,dislikes, fetishes, strengths, weaknesses, and emotional emphases. These arebroadcast throughdirect communication, habits, dress, style of life, career patterns, choice offriends, and the like.In normal social or business contact, one usually sees only the “tip of theiceberg” of thischaracter makeup. This is because individuals in modern society are accustomedto project anddisplay only those parts of their characters which they feel are advantageous ina given situation.The magician, like Sherlock Holmes, must habitually look for clues to the restof the iceberg- if possible without the subject’s being aware of this. If the subject realizesthat what WilhelmReich called his “character armor” is being probed and penetrated, he will reactwith distrust,annoyance, and antagonism.The purpose of such an analysis is not necessarily to deceive or exploit thesubject. Mostoften it is simply to gain a better picture of him or her, so that subsequentdialogue andencounters can be more fruitful and comfortable for both parties. It is oftenremarked that thecompany of a magician is stimulating and pleasing. Much of this is due to themagician’sautomatic, almost subconscious tailoring of his mannerisms to a style mosteffective in aparticular situation.The philosophers Gurdjieff and Ouspensky were fond of saying that most peoplespendtheir lives “asleep” - meaning that they are content to allow their behavior tobe governed byinstinctive or habitual reactions to external stimuli. As you look beyondsurface impressions ofindividuals, you will probably be surprised - and even dismayed - at howapplicable this reproachhas been to your own life-style.Similar considerations apply to larger numbers of people, resulting in“groupthink” amonga few and “crowd consciousness” among a more impersonal many. Business,political, andreligious leaders are successful to the extent that they correctly assess andexploit suchtendencies.As you attempt to form more perfect pictures of people and events around you,and as youbegin to resist a life of merely reacting to stimuli yourself, you will findthat you “wake up”. To be“awake” in this sense is to be in a condition of stress, since you will bemaking deliberatedecisions about many things which you previously dealt with semiconsciously[hence semi-intelligently]. You will be able to sustain this level of mental activity andconcentration for onlybrief periods of time. It is not necessary for you to irritate and exhaustyourself by trying toextend those periods. Rather keep the ability to “awake” close at hand, ready tosummon whenappropriate. 100In addition to self-determined personality traits, human beings are influencedby a varietyof physical factors of which they are generally unaware. If the magician isaware of them, he is ina position to take them into account when assessing a subject’s present orprobable futurebehavior. 101This process of investigating the conscious and subconscious factors governing asubject’sbehavior is neither quick nor easy. To be done correctly, it requires carefulresearch (which mayprove difficult and be regarded as an invasion of privacy) as well as anacquired expertise on thepart of the magician to interpret the results carefully and objectively. Becauseof time andresource limitations, the magician must usually settle for something less than acomplete100 Physiologically human thinking is only about 5% conscious, with the other95% subconscious stimulus/responseaccording to assimilated “patterns of reality”. Cf. Leonard Mlodinow, Ph.D.,Subliminal: How Your UnconsciousMind Rules Your Behavior (New York: Pantheon, 2012).101 Cf. again the discussion of PSYCONs in MindWar.- 216 -picture. The more incomplete the picture, of course, the more margin for errorin the emergentpicture.The distinction between LBM and merely being a good amateur psychologist is thatthemagician is specifically interested in behavior determinants which are obscureand consciouslyunknown to the subject. The magician’s object is to assess the individualwithout it beingapparent that he is “practicing psychology” on him. The result is frequentlythat the deductionsand consequent actions of the magician appear mysterious and even supernatural.C. EthicsAs you become adept in LBM, you will be tempted to use it for all manner ofpersonalgratification. The more skilled you are, the more you will be inclined to thinkthat you can getaway with almost anything. The governing factor is not whether you can or can’t,but ratherwhether your consciously-determined ethics allow you to.As you begin to direct your life independently of morals, codes, and customsimposed uponyou by the politics and propaganda of society, you will have to assume theresponsibility for yourown ethics. Only if you are known to be a strictly ethical individual will yourfreedomfrom social norms be tolerated. Otherwise you will be ostracized and probablypersecutedby society. If it cannot be sure of controlling you, it will tend not to trustyou to control yourselfintelligently unless you make it very clear that you can do precisely that. Inthat case society willtend not only to tolerate you, but even to respect and admire you for theunique, creative beingthat you are. The following section discusses ethics in greater detail.Before one can consider the proper place of ethics in Setian behavior, “ethics”as a termmust be raised from a vague sentiment to something more concrete. It is,unfortunately, one ofthose terms whose elusiveness has made it all too susceptible to casual andcursory use. “He’s anethical person,” we say - and leave it at that. What are ethics? How can weidentify them, andhow should we judge them?Ethics, alternatively called moral philosophy, seeks to distinguish what is goodfromwhat is bad and to formulate justifiable reasons for making such distinctions.As a branch of philosophy, ethics is a normative science; that is, it seeks toidentifyprinciples of good and evil that transcend social, cultural, or politicalconvention (social contracttheory).Beyond a merely normative approach to ethics is metaethics, which seeks toinvestigatenormative currency-terms such as “good”, “evil”, “justice”, “ought”, “right”,and “wrong”. Theneutrality and objectivity of metaethics presume that such terms are notdependent upon moralbeliefs (such as religion). The metaethical concept of naturalism, advanced bytheorists such asJohn Dewey and Herbert Spencer, posits that moral terms have a basis inscientific fact.Intuitionists agree that moral terms have an external, reliable basis butattribute it to self-evident (“I know it when I see it”) qualities.Challenging intuitionists and naturalists are moral skepticists who insist thatmoralterms are completely arbitrary. Emotivists claim that such terms have nocapacity for beingtrue or false in themselves, and that the people who use them are simply statingtheir emotionsabout an issue. Subjectivists maintain that moral judgments state subjectivefacts only aboutattitudes, not the objects of those attitudes. And Imperativists insist thatmoral judgments areactually “commands” in another guise, hence do not focus at all on criteria oftruth or objectivity.When even its basic language terms are so fraught with controversy, normativeethics is offto a rough start. Beyond this are arguments over the criteria for making anykind of moraljudgment. Teleologists maintain that the morality of an action is determinedsolely by itsconsequences. Some teleologists, such as Plato, insist that the perfection ofthe self is the correct- 217 -consequence; hedonists say that it is mere pleasure; utilitarians counter thatit must be thegreatest benefit to society. Theologians, such as Aquinas, Luther, et al. ,dispense with teleologyaltogether in favor of obedience to proclaimed or perceived morality from a Godor gods.The sharpest attack on ethics generally comes from egoists such as Thomas HobbesandFriedrich Nietzsche (cf. his Genealogy of Morals) [and Ragnar Redbeard!], whoconsider allethics as verbal camouflage to conceal the reality that all actions are merelyin the interest of thestronger (who by that same strength dictate all definitions of “justice”,“right”, etc.). The egoistposition was represented in the Platonic Dialogue The Republic by Glaucon, andwent on to formthe basis for Enlightenment “social contract” theories (Hobbes, Locke,Rousseau), wherein“justice” and related terms became just matters of agreement and contractbetween the people ofa society.Accordingly it is not surprising that practical problem-solvers shy away frommetaethicalissues and try rather to address questions in terms of what are generally calleddescriptiveethics - the customs and standards of a given culture which serve asmeasurements of rightnessand wrongness within that culture. An acceptance of descriptive ethics as ethicsleads to anattitude of ethical relativism, according to which there is no standard forjudging right andwrong apart from the cultural environment of specific situations. Hence thekilling of humans byhumans may be “ethical” if sanctioned by a judge or national sovereign, but theidentical act maybe “unethical” if undertaken by an individual, regardless of reasons.Until the Enlightenment of the late-17th and 18th centuries, ethical philosophywascompletely metaethical; standards of good and evil were accepted as beingprescribed by one ormore divinities or divine principles ( neteru, Forms). It was humanity’s tasknot to determineethics, but rather to understand and obey divinely-ordained ethics.To reprise an important point in Chapter #3, the ancient Egyptians perceived theuniverseas actively controlled by conscious, natural principles or “gods” ( neteru inhieroglyphic). To theEgyptians, all of “nature” (derived from neteru) was alive and the directconsequence of the willsof the neteru. Nature was intelligible not just through inanimate, automatic,general regularitieswhich could be discovered via observation, but also through connections andassociationsbetween things and events perceived in the human mind. There was no distinctionbetween “reality” and “appearance”; anything capable of exerting an effect uponthe mindthereby existed. Justice and virtue were sought in manifestations of beauty,symmetry, andharmony, and were personified by the goddess Ma’at.In contrast to the Egyptian view of humanity as being a harmonious component ofnature -symbolized by the pharaoh’s position as half-divine deputy of the neteru -ancientMesopotamian tradition posited humanity as something estranged from the gods.Virtue inMesopotamia was thus understood as obedience to the willful desires of thegod(s), not harmonywith their natural principles. Mesopotamian kings sought the “right ruling” oftheir communitiesin accordance with the Akkadian principle of shulmu (later the Hebrew shalom), aterm meaningnot just “peace” but the community well-being that engenders peace. In theHebraic system, Godis not intelligible through reason or logic, but rather through prophecy and thehistory of events,whether or not the events’ outcomes seem situationally appropriate (theodicy).The Hebraicpresumption of a “covenant” between mankind and a divinity reflected the notionthat mankindis given a “mission” and/or a “destiny”, and that virtue lies in the fulfillmentof that mission/destiny - whether or not it is æsthetically palatable or even understandable.Herein lie the rootsof a certain kind of “outcome-justified” thinking that is prevalent in modernculture.The ethics of Plato reflect his commitment to teleology, the doctrine thatpurpose anddesign are apparent in nature, and that natural phenomena move inexorablytowards certaingoals of ultimate self-realization. [The opposite of teleology is mechanism,which describes- 218 -phenomena in terms of prior causes rather than presumed destination orfulfillment. Modernscience is thus mechanistic.]In his Dialogues Plato, through the character of Socrates, endorsed the EgyptianandPythagorean model of human virtue as a particularization of universal principles(an applicationof his famous “Theory of the Forms”). Such Forms or principles could beapprehended throughrigorous exercise of the higher faculties of reason ( dianoia), leading to anintuitional or nœticapprehension of the good - and a simultaneous veneration of it for its own sake.This processPlato referred to as the dialectic, meaning self-teaching through theexamination and refutationof logically- or factually-imperfect concepts.In Plato’s Republic Socrates is unable to directly refute Glaucon’s egoistcharge that justiceis merely a rationalization for the prevailing of the interests of the stronger.Socrates can onlysuggest, through the analogy of a perfectly-harmonious “republic”, that it ismore natural for aman to be just if his psyche is healthy and each part is doing its proper work.The virtuous stateis held up as “the psyche writ large”.Aristotle, the most famous of the early mechanists, laid the groundwork forsituationalethics by denying that virtue, truth, beauty, and the other Pythagorean/PlatonicForms existed inan absolute sense. Such values, as they applied to humanity, were rather to besought inmoderation between unacceptable extremes in specific situations: Aristotle’sdoctrine of the“golden mean”.Until this point in human history, ethics and politics were inseparable; theindividual’sgood and the community’s good had to be pursued together; there was no suchthing as“personal ethics within an unethical state”, nor “an ethical state comprised ofunethical citizens”.The sins of Œdipus necessitated not only his blinding but his exile, andSocrates’ challenge to theharmony of Athens was considered sufficient grounds to condemn him to death.Socrateshimself acknowledged this principle, accepting his execution as a “cure” of hisfunction as a kindof social “illness” - albeit one whose impact would ultimately strengthen theAthenian politicalculture.In the Hellenistic era - the period following the conquests of Alexander theGreat - ancientmankind lost its innocence. Elaborate philosophical systems dependent uponspecific culturaldeities were discredited when other cultures with different philosophies anddifferent gods wereseen to be doing just as well - and perhaps better. Materialism was the order ofthe day, and thepower of ethics to influence society was denied by the Cynics and Skeptics. Ifvirtue had anyplace in human affairs, it was in one’s personal conduct. Epicureanism held thatvirtue couldbe found in the happiness of the soul, and that such happiness was to be pursuednot by merehedonistic indulgence, but rather by disassociating oneself from the corruptionof society.Stoicism also despaired of social ethics, but insisted that personal ethics wereto be pursued byone’s labors within the social fabric rather than apart from it.The importance of Stoicism to the subsequent path of Western civilization canscarcely beoveremphasized. Stoics, like Aristotle, sought validation of knowledge insense-experience ratherthan through abstract logic or intuition. A wise man, said the Stoics, candistinguish reliableimpressions ( kataleptika phantasia = “grasping impressions”) from etherealones. Humanity isintegral with nature; virtue is to be found in reason-based endurance of thenatural flux. Thus ifevil comes to the good man, it is only temporary and not really evil, since inthe greater sense it isnatural. The Stoic thus accepts the fortunes and misfortunes of life calmly,seeking to avoidpassionate loss of objectivity. The Stoics’ ideal was a gradually-evolving“worldsociety” ( cosmopolis) transcending geographic and cultural divisions.Stoicism was the primary ethical force in the Roman Republic and Empire, and itis notsurprising to find its core principles adopted by early Christianity.Augustine’s doctrine of the“two cities” reflected the Stoic notion of a virtuous soul coexisting with aflawed social system. By- 219 -the medieval era, the “two cities” had been refined into Thomas Aquinas’“hierarchy of laws”,with social and political “human law” placed firmly beneath [church-] revealed“divine law” andStoic-derived “natural law”. The contradictions and corruptions of such aclimate spawnedMachiavelli.Niccolo Machiavelli (after whom the Devil began to be called “Old Nick”) soughttoprescribe wise conduct ( virtu) for Italian princes faced with unavoidableproblems ( necessita)brought about by factors beyond their control ( fortuna). Contrary to hischurch-propagandizedimage, Machiavelli was constantly and intensely concerned with the establishmentof the ethicalsociety, and his manipulative techniques were justified in his eyes by the “bestpolitical resultsunder the circumstances” that he expected as the eventual outcome. Preciselyquoted, thefamous passage from Chapter #18 of The Prince reads:In the actions of all men, and especially of princes who are not subject to acourt of appeal,we must always look to the end.While Machiavelli advocated the tacit manipulation of society for deliberate[and ultimatelyvirtuous] ends, early Protestant theorists such as Martin Luther and John Calvinregarded ethicsas being beyond the rational reach of mankind. The basis for ethical behavior,they said, is that arighteous man will automatically incline towards such behavior, not because itis logically orempirically justified in itself. Salvation (=attainment of righteousness) isattainable only throughthe complete surrender of oneself to Christ. This constituted a rejection ofmedievalscholasticism, and of the “logical ethics” arguments of Aristotle (whom Luthercalled “thisdamned, conceited, rascally heathen”) and Aquinas. The impact of the ProtestantReformationwas to remove the rational basis and responsibility for either personal orsocial ethics, replacingthese with the notion of ethics as a suprarational article of religious faith -to be selectivelyinvoked by spokesmen for that religion.With the social-contract theorists of the 17th- and 18th-century “Enlightenment”came arenaissance of reason - including as the negotiated basis for ethics. ThomasHobbes, afterGlaucon, denied the religious tenet of a “supreme good”, seeing in its placeonly material self-interest and gratification. Hobbes’ prescribed social contract was thus anegative one,establishing an atmosphere of truce between citizens who would otherwise savageone anothermercilessly. Such a contemptuous view of humanity evolved forward into many“lower”ideologies of contemporary society, most conspicuously communism. “Hobbes,” KarlMarx issaid to have muttered, “is the father of us all.” It should be pointed out,however, that Hobbes’reputation for harshness came not from personal preference, but rather from acoldly practicalanalysis of what makes human beings behave unpleasantly towards one another.Previously“evil” had been excused as a theological force, or as the result of “originalsin”, i.e. something forwhich rational individuals could not be held exclusively responsible. Hobbesdenied suchexcuses.In contrast to Hobbes, John Locke suggested that social-contract nations couldexist on apositively cooperative basis of mutual interest. It is important to note thatLocke’sprescription was based not on idealistic abstractions (such as ethics), butrather on attainablematerial objectives: “life, liberty, and estate”. Like Hobbes, he sought todesign a societyreflecting “basic man” rather than one espousing unattainable ideals andexpectations. Locke’spositively-cooperative assumptions and prescription for limited government baseduponmajority rule formed the philosophical basis for the American Declaration ofIndependence andConstitution, to include the latter’s Bill of Rights [against the government].Locke recommendeda “reasonable Christianity” - a faith which, while satisfying personal religiousdesires, would playonly a symbolic and ceremonial role in political decision-making.- 220 -The history of social-contract ethics does not cease with John Locke, but hisideas, asimmortalized in the aforementioned documents, ordained the ethical atmosphere ofUnitedStates political culture, in which the Temple of Set is principally based, tothe present day. Thisatmosphere may be summarized in five general maxims:(1) Government based on law is a positive institution, not something to beeliminated in an ideal society.(2) Good government is a construct of the people and is responsible to them(socialcontract theory), not to a higher religion, destiny, or ideology.(3) The will of the people is best ascertained through the opinion of themajority,which thus determines “political truth”. [It is precisely because there is noauthority superior to such majority opinion that Locke placed certain“inalienablerights” of all humanity beyond the reach of government.](4) As society is based upon cooperative self-interest, so the attractions ofsuch self-interest - for example, private property - must be preserved and enhanced asbeneficial and indeed vital features of that society.(5) There is an intrinsic dignity in the individual human life which must beacceptedand respected as an article of faith.To the Lockean frame of mind, these values are, in the words of the DeclarationofIndependence, “held to be self-evident”; they are beyond debate, beyondcompromise.Nevertheless many other cultures do not accept them in whole or part - and donotnecessarily see this as a deficiency in their social structures.As the United States aged sufficiently to develop a sense of and regard for itsown history,“pure” Lockean theory became leavened with a measure of ethical conservatism: anacceptance of certain things as “good” simply because they have continued to betolerated overan extended period of time.Conservatism was elevated to a deliberate ethical philosophy by David Hume, whodefinedthe morally good as what one ought to do according to prevailing passionatecustom. Humedenied that the good could be ascertained by dispassionate reasoning. Reason, hesaid, is usefulonly to discover the most practical or sensible approaches to problems. Hencevirtue and vice areproducts of sentiment. Virtue is not approved because it is “intrinsicallyvirtue”; it isconsidered to be virtue because it meets with passionate approval.The point of this brief tour through certain key concepts in the evolution ofethics is simplyto show clearly what all too many people perceive only dimly and imprecisely -how the UnitedStates has developed its “official ethics”. If this background is notunderstood, Setians cannotclearly understand why certain ethical norms are expected in this country - orunderstand whysome foreign cultures “mysteriously/unreasonably” reject those norms ... oftenon what theyconsider to be ethical grounds!The science of ethics is not peripheral or incidental to the Temple of Set; itis central to it.Whether people hold a certain opinion or behave in a certain way is criticallyinfluenced bywhether or not they believe themselves justified in so doing. Once “rightness”or “wrongness” isestablished, specific LBM workings will be interpreted accordingly. In order tobe effective, amagician must first recognize and consciously appreciate the ethical componentsof hisdesigns that are particular to their cultural point of origin.- 221 -Earlier in this chapter it was demonstrated that Western civilization’s effortsto apprehend“truth” - and to answer the integral question of whether “truth” and “the good”are inseparable -have been arduous and frustrating. The United States emerged at a moment inhistory - theEnlightenment - when reason reigned supreme, and so the values of theEnlightenment’s mostoptimistic and practical political philosopher, John Locke, were incorporatedinto ourConstitution.Lockean values have served us reasonably well these past two centuries, but whatof thosecountries who have “worshipped strange gods”? What do they know of “the good”,and in whatrespect - if any - do they hold “the truth”?The principal social contract theorists - Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau - saw thestate as ahuman construct, justifiable only as it might serve the interests of itscitizens. The first of twogreat challenges to this preeminence of the individual came from Georg W.F.Hegel, who insistedthat the state is prior to man.Hegel conceived of the universe as the manifestation of God’s mind seekingcomplete self-realization through a process called dialectic idealism. As applied to ourparticular planet, it isthe notion that the history of the world consists of part of the spirit of God,manifesting itselfthrough the collective spirits of mankind, moving onwards through logic (thedialectic) towardscompletion. An existing idea (thesis) is criticized and partially refuted by itsopposite(antithesis), resulting in a more perfect product (synthesis). Hegel felt theorganic state to bethe manifestation or reflection of the dialectic of God’s mind in the world.Accordingly it mightwell proceed in ways and towards goals which are not necessarily the sum totalof the ways andgoals of the individual human minds within it.The task of national leaders, according to Hegel, is thus to apprehend the“spirit of thestate” ( Volksgeist) and to make their decisions in support of its furthermentrather than for thecitizens who may chance to populate it at a given point in time. TheEnlightenment values ofindividualism and rights against a government were considered by Hegel to limitfreedom:Since they reduce the scope and power of the whole, they serve to restrictpossibility.Hegel plus a heavy dose of 19th-century Wagnerian Romanticism pointed the way tothestate-cults of National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy. Germany inparticular sought toredirect the sense of life-consciousness from the individual human being to thestate. MostGermans were able to achieve this only in a mundane sense - in a kind ofecstatic selflessnesscreated and sustained by propaganda. But the “monk-knights” of the prewar SScould disdain,even willingly embrace the death of the individual human body according to thedoctrine thatdisciplined personal consciousness could be transferred to a larger life-form -that of theHegelian state - and that individual sacrifice towards the strengthening of thatlife-form wouldactually contribute towards one’s greater immortality. In a very real wayincomprehensible to themundane mind, therefore, all of the individual-death references in the SS - suchas theTotenkopf insignia and ritual pledges of “faithfulness unto death” - were infact arrogantaffirmations of immortality. To Dr. Rauschning Hitler remarked:To the Christian doctrine of the infinite significance of the individual humansoul and ofpersonal responsibility, I oppose with icy clarity the saving doctrine of thenothingness andinsignificance of the individual human being, and of his continued existence inthe visibleimmortality of the nation. The dogma of vicarious suffering and death through adivine saviorgives place to that of the representative living and acting of the newLeader-legislator, whichliberates the mass of the faithful from the burden of free will.Both National Socialism and Fascism are now ghosts of history, but the principlewhichunderlay their phenomenal power and impact - the organic state as prior to itscitizens - remainsvery much a force in the contemporary international environment.- 222 -In the United States, social and political truth is arrived at via the methodsspecified in theConstitution, all of which are based on some combination of direct orrepresentative voting. Ournational perception of truth is thus democratic - an approach which John Lockewould considereminently reasonable, but one which would affront Plato and Hegel. To them,truth was/is anabsolute principle - not something to be determined by whim, much less by themasses. Platoheld that truth could be attained through the dialectic of human philosophicalenquiry; Hegelinsisted that only God could consciously employ such a dialectic, and that themost humanitycould hope for was to sense its reflection through the dynamics of the state.What is it we see when we look at the many “democracies” and “republics” of theworld andperceive them to be behaving not as vehicles for the benefit of their individualcitizens, butrather as cultural amœbæ of ethnocentric, even xenophobic passion whichcontemptuouslysweep aside appeals to reason? A few are relics of ancient theocratic systems,but most have shedthis worn-out skin only to regenerate it under the guise of the Volksgeist.One may indeed communicate with the citizens of such cultures as individuals,but toinfluence the culture as a whole one may not appeal just to the citizens’individual desires.Rather one must speak to the interest of whatever it is that they perceive their“national spirit” tobe. To seek to “Westernize” it - to alter citizens’ conception of the state intoa social-contractmodel - is to attack not a set of rational opinions, but an article of faithwhich is perceived tobe the very fountain of truth and ethics.The second great challenge to social-contract individualism came, of course,from KarlMarx. Marx was strongly influenced by Hegel, but believed that Hegel had made afundamentalmistake in using nations as the basis for his dialectic and in relating it to adivine manifestationor purpose. Marx considered the dialectic to be a function of economic strugglebetween socialclasses, and he denied the existence of any supernatural intelligence, callingall religion “theopiate of the people”.Marxism, sometimes called dialectic materialism to distinguish it from thedialecticidealism of Hegel, is a theory of socialism that identifies class struggle asthe fundamental forcein history. Increasing concentration of industrial control in the capitalistclass and theconsequent intensification of class antagonisms and of misery among the workerswill lead to arevolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat and the subsequentestablishment of a classless,utopian society.Marx, like Hegel, premised his ideas on a necessary, inevitable process ofhistory.Thus communism would eventually come to pass, no matter what capitalism tries todo to stopit. The other side of this coin is that there is nothing Marxists can do tospeed it up; their societymust first evolve to the “last stages” of decadent capitalism. This didn’t suitV.I. Lenin, whowanted to accelerate social evolution a bit. His prescription for doing so wasthe so-called“dictatorship of the proletariat”, under which a communist elite wouldforce-march the massestowards their eventual paradise. The state apparat would then “wither away”.As in the case of Hegelian state-preeminence, communism cannot simply bechallenged orrefuted by appeals to individual self-interest. To a serious Marxist, history isagain moved by fargreater forces than the wills of individuals who may chance to inhabit it at agiven point in time.Marxist states view the advanced capitalist cultures as social bombscollectively approachingcritical mass; their desire is accordingly to avoid being caught up in thedesperate externaladventurism, including apocalyptic warfare, which they expect deterioratingcapitalist nations toemploy in an effort to stave off their inevitable communist revolutions.Communism [to use the label by which modern Marxism is generally known]incorporatestwo attitudes towards the truth. The “greater truth” - the materialist dialectic- is considered tobe absolute, and adherence to it is once again supra-rational: an article offaith. Why an articleof faith? Because the people, if given the sole power to determine thegovernment, might revolt- 223 -against it again - particularly if it is not [as per Locke] designed tofacilitate their pursuit ofpersonal interests. The option of further revolution must therefore be removed -by representingthe Communist Party as the “priesthood” of a “god” higher than that of thepeople themselves. Inservice to this “god”, lesser ethical issues are unimportant - and indeedheretical if they confuseor inhibit the greater truth.When capitalists seek to “reason” with communists, they fail to realize thatthey areregarded as ignorant, corrupt, or deluded by their very inability to see andaccept the“great truth” . A sincere communist does not reason with such an opponent anymore thanwith a child; he seeks rather to placate, deceive, or otherwise control him.To communicate with a communist theoretician is thus a difficult task. One mustfirstestablish basic rapport by displaying an understanding of, if not an agreementwith Marxisttheory. Immediate goals of mutual interest may then be pursued jointly insofaras they do notintrude into ideological realms where the communist’s position must necessarilyrigidify.A curious and paradoxical picture emerges from this examination of communist vs.capitalist ethics. In the West we are accustomed to regard the United States asa “religious”society, and to condemn communism for its “godlessness”. In communist countriestheoristsdisdain Western adherence to religion and take pride in communism’s “stateatheism”. But isthis picture borne out in practice?Locke advocated a national structure in which supreme wisdom lay in the will ofthecitizenry and in which organized religion played only a symbolic and ceremonialrole: in hiswords a “reasonable Christianity”. Our governments have since approached ournational andinternational problems under the presumption that the free will of the humanbeingsdirectly involved will order the course of events. This is vintageEnlightenment-thinking,and to date the United States has seen no reason to subordinate it to any“higher authority”. Interms of its political decision-making processes, the United States behavesatheistically.On the other hand, communist leaders do not consider themselves able to controlorinfluence the passage of events as free agents. They may make minor adjustmentshere andthere, but the basic course of the future is above and beyond their control,locked in placeaccording to Marx’ principles of historic determinism. Like the ancientMesopotamians, theyperceive themselves as the incidental tools of a “god” - whose name just happensto be DialecticMaterialism instead of Baal or Marduk. In terms of its political decision-makingprocesses,communism behaves theistically.Where ethics are concerned, therefore, capitalism holds itself fully responsiblefor its own,while communism considers any and all “minor” ethical abuses automaticallyjustified if inservice of its “god”. This is a very crucial point - and it explains why theUnited States goesthrough such persistent agonies of self-criticism while communist countries suchas China andthe late Soviet Union shrug off far more horrendous excesses.[At the conclusion of the 20th Century CE, the Soviet Union dissolved intoconstituentquasi-capitalist states. Communism as a political and economic phenomenon hasrevealed itsfragility. It will be interesting to see what happens to communism as a“religion”.]The Black Magician contemplating a particular LBM working must thereforedetermine notonly whether that working will be ethical in his eyes, but also ethicalaccording to the culturalmindsets of all other parties to the working: participants, objects, catalysts,witnesses. To label aworking “good” or “evil” by some knee-jerk, propagandistic formula is entirelyinadequate.[Formula “good/evil” values are merely appropriate for the profane masses, whocan’t - anddon’t want to - understand anything more precise.]There is thus no easy answer to the question of whether a given magical act is“good” or“evil”. In itself it is ethically neutral. As Machiavelli so clearly observed,it is the result itproduces which will be judged - and then it is up to the magician to determinewhat judgments- 224 -- by which judges - will be important. Successfully conducted, such anassessment will not onlyreinforce the success of a given working; it will also ensure that the magiciancorrectlyanticipates the actual consequences of its immediate results.This chapter was intended to achieve two goals: First, to alert you to the factthat everyonein the world is practicing LBM on everyone else, usually unconsciously andusually extremelyunskillfully. Second, to advise you that, as you become sensitive to its use onyou - and skilled inyour own use of it on others - you can accomplish a great deal.You will now have to go out and study the aforementioned subjects, practicethem, andbecome fluent in them before they will be of any real use to you. Just readingthis chapter andassuming that you “get the message” is not sufficient.It is perhaps appropriate to conclude with a brief but necessary warning: As anassociationof Adepts in LBM, the Temple of Set could not function cooperatively if itsInitiates practicedthis particular Art on one another, no matter with what good intentions. You aretrusting theTemple and its sages to enhance and Recognize your self-initiation - not tomislead orexploit you for lesser/ulterior purposes. You must reciprocate in turn. Soremember this pointand remember it well:Do not - ever - attempt to control another Setian through LBM.Because he trusts you not to, his usual guards will be down, and you may thinkhim easy toinfluence in this way. Nevertheless it is just a question of time before eitheryour “victim” oranother Setian realizes what is happening, whereupon you will find yourselffacing probableexpulsion.In all contacts and communications within the Temple, be straightforward,direct, andopen. In profane society you might be pounced upon as a “mark” or “sucker” forsuch behavior,but within the Temple of Set you will find yourself trusted and respected as afellow Initiate andmagician.[index-225_1.jpg][index-225_2.jpg]- 225 -20: Greater Black MagicThere are two sharp distinctions between the Temple of Set’s principles andthose of otherreligions, philosophies, and occult doctrines. The first is that, while we donot consider logicalpositivism as being sufficient to explain the universe, we do consider it anecessary foundationupon which to build such an explanation. Sound metaphysics must be in keepingwith what isknown about related subjects in physics, else the metaphysics are simplyarticles of faith. “Faith”is how one excuses a belief he cannot justify through any rational or logicalcriteria.Therefore it is not enough to feel blind trust in and enthusiasm for Setianconcepts of realityOne must know how those concepts came to be formulated as being most probablytrue. He mustunderstand the reasoning behind each proposition. Initiation implies not justknowing how butalso knowing why.The second distinctive characteristic of the Temple of Set is its utilitarianapproach toWhite Magic (WM) and Lesser Black Magic (LBM). The former, embracing allconventionalreligions and occultisms, is assessed simply as fraud and/or self-delusion. TheTemple of Set hasno self-appointed mission to cure the mass of humanity of fraud or delusion, sowe ignore WhiteMagicians as courteously as possible.Chapter #19’s discussion of LBM illustrated that many social and scientifictechniques usedcasually, ignorantly, or inexpertly by the rest of society are utilized by theBlack Magician torealize his immediate goals in the OU. Further that mastery of LBM does not comequickly oreasily, and that it is by no means a substitute for cooperation with society’saccepted rules ofcompetition, survival, and prosperity. It is a specialized technique for use insituations whichappear to be ideally suited to it, and it is generally used as an enhancement tomore ordinarytechniques already in play.Many of those who encountered the Temple of Set’s predecessor institution, theChurch ofSatan, were confused by the Satanic Bible’s approach to magic. First, in the“Book of Satan”, itscorned all belief systems and reduced all gods and demons to simple fantasiesandpsychological crutches. But then, in the subsequent Books of “Lucifer”,“Belial”, and “Leviathan”,it promised satisfaction in return for appealing to various demons throughritual. The publicapology for this seeming inconsistency was that rituals are mere psychodrama:play-acting foremotional gratification. But the reality was that the rituals were performedwith completeseriousness throughout all the Grottos of the Church, and that they in factyielded the resultsthey promised, at least to some degree.The Satanic Priesthood gradually concluded that, although the mythologicalimagery ofsuch ritual might be prima facie inaccurate and inconsistent, the particulartype of mental andwillful concentration achieved during ritual did in fact exert an effect uponboth the celebrant- 226 -and the OU. To the celebrant it seemed that, as his concentration and projectionof willincreased, the normal barriers of space and time began to recede. Thecelebrant’s SU appeared toforce its way into the OU in a limited, focused fashion.What this meant for the fledgling Satanist was an experience of the “blurring ofreality”. Itwas often disturbing and distressing, just as the experience of hallucination orschizophrenia canbe disturbing and distressing. A ritual working differed from psychosis,however, in that themagician’s own mental coherence - his sense of identity and ability to organizehis thought -remained unimpaired. He knew precisely what was happening: where each universebegan andthe other one ended, what he wished to do, and how to increase, decrease, orhalt the interaction.As the Satanist became increasingly familiar with the sensations of ritualmagic, his fear ofit would disappear and he would become proficient at creating precisely theblend of universesdesired. The need for OU props (a physical ritual chamber) to create a suitablydramaticatmosphere lessened, as did the need for texts, incantations, and scripts.Ultimately a thresholdwould be reached where the experience and exercise of ritual became a completelyfluent one forthe magician, who could now blend his SU with the OU and accomplish changes init asdelicately as a skilled surgeon might wield a scalpel.An individual’s SU, to be sure, is extremely fluid. It may closely resemble theOU, or it maybecome bizarre and fantastic. Many clinical schizophrenics are simply those whohave lost theability to distinguish the SU from the OU, and who in some cases are at themercy of “runaway”SU mental imagery.Clinical schizophrenia is usually involuntary - the result of a physicallydiseased or injuredbrain, or of extraordinary psychological stress. A danger of ritual magic isthat the experiencemay become so intoxicating that the underlying sense of perspective upon andbalance betweenthe two universes may be neglected or abandoned, resulting in an uncontrolledblending process.The magician is still in control of his will, but he is unable to accuratelydistinguish the elementsof the OU from those of his SU. He makes mistakes, which appear in his SU asinexplicableabortions of his previously effective desires and creations. Ultimately he maylose all control ofhis consciousness, becoming a paranoiac and/or a megalomaniac.The old myth that you will endanger your soul if you dare to experiment withBlack Magicthus has more than a grain of truth in it. Not because some fiend in red tightsis going to dragyou down to Dante’s Inferno in punishment for your blasphemy, but rather becauseyou arenow exercising your mind in the deliberate conception and construction of itsownexternal frames of reference. If you do this with prudence, intelligence, andsensitivity, theresult will be a more excellent state of being (= initiation). If you do itimpulsively or carelessly,the result could be disastrous.The Temple of Set thus repeats the warning in its introductory literature: BlackMagic isdangerous. LBM is dangerous because it can tempt the individual to unethicalabuse of itstechniques, while GBM is dangerous because its practice makes possible thedestruction of theperspectives of the rational consciousness. Extreme care must be taken whenexperimentingwith either discipline. And so to the specific subject of this chapter:Greater Black Magic (GBM) is the causing of change to occur in the SU inaccordance with the will. This change in the SU may cause a similar andharmonious change in the OU.Examine this definition. A deliberate effort is made to alter one’s subjectiveframe ofreference, so that a thing which used to be conceptualized one way is nowconceptualized inanother. A distasteful situation may be adjusted to produce a favorable outcome;a live enemymay be adjusted to be neutralized or nonexistent; a desire of any sort may berealized ordispelled.- 227 -Magical manuals from the medieval grimoires to the Satanic Bible have discussedthe useof imagery as an aid to this process. Perhaps the most stereotypical example ofthis is thesticking of pins into a wax effigy to cause harm [the origin of the quip “stickit to him/her”]. InWalt Disney’s Dumbo the little elephant was given a feather to hold with histrunk. He was toldthat it was a magic feather which would enable him to fly - and he did so byflapping his ears.When he eventually lost the feather, he started to fall, until he was told thatthe feather wasreally nothing more than an ordinary feather. As soon as he realized that he wasthe source ofthe “magic”, he flapped his ears again and regained altitude.Photographs, wax images, talismans, music, fires, swords, statues, and indeedentire ritualchambers have no more intrinsic magic in them than Dumbo’s feather. Theireffectiveness inmagic, again like that feather, comes from their significance to the magician.If he grantsthem certain powers in his SU - if he credits them with atmospheres, auras,curses, or blessings -they will assuredly have them. They will possess these qualities absolutely inthe SU.Once this occurs, the phenomenon of the magical link (ML) between the SU and OUwilltransfer a portion of the quality to the items’ objective mass. The potency andendurance of thetransfer depends upon the skill and willpower of the consecrating magician, thescope of theworking, the amount of distortion in the OU attempted, and a wide variety ofphysical andenvironmental factors which may range from sunspot activity to a sore toe whichintrudes uponthe magician’s concentration. Perception and activation of the imbued qualitiesby anothermagician will similarly depend upon the skill and willpower which he brings tobear upon suchobjects.The implications of this principle are fascinating. Among other things itexplains whysophisticated magical workings based on a variety of different gods or pantheonshave worked. Itmakes no difference whether the gods be socially generated (like those ofancient Greece) orpersonally created (like those of H.P. Lovecraft). It makes no differencewhether the EnochianKeys be phrased in honor of YHVH (as in John Dee’s diaries), in honor of Satan(as in theSatanic Bible), or in honor of Set (as in the Word of Set). Accusations ofheresy, blasphemy, and/or inauthenticity - whether historically justified or not - are simply barkingup the wrong treefrom a magical standpoint.Another implication of the operational principle of GBM is that there is a largeamount of it“loose” in the OU by individuals who are generating it without calling it bythat name andwithout even realizing what they are doing. Every time we have an “objectiveimpression” ofsomething possessing a quality which its physical characteristics do notsubstantiate, we aresampling the results of a GBM operation on the OU.To take a few common examples: Snakes and rats are usually thought to be sneakyand evil,birds and cats beautiful; smog and sludge unnatural, trees and flowers natural.Many SUs agreeupon and reinforce such interpretations, and in the OU it becomes increasinglydifficult toidentify the phenomenon in question without the subjectively-imposed “overlay”.[Such overlaysmay also be called “biases”, “prejudices”, or “points of perspective”.]We are thus the victims of a worldwide GBM epidemic which has manifest itself aspoliticalideologies, artistic æsthetics, advertising, social morality, etc. We cannothonestly say that we“live” in the OU, but rather in a crazy-quilt of SU overlays on the OU. Thefirst thing themagician must do is realize this; the second thing he must do is attempt to seeand understandthe actual OU through all the layers. The third thing he must do is attempt tochange parts of theOU carefully and precisely through his own magical workings, both LBM and GBM.The “unconscious” GBM of profane society works because of sheer mass, as a herdofbuffalo will break through a fence that would easily stop any one of them. Atthe same time thisprofane effort is chaotic, unreliable, and ultimately random in itsconsequences.- 228 -Attempts to control such massive social forces have been made by many politicalandreligious leaders throughout history. All have failed in whole or in part, evenwhen the illusion ofcontrol could be created. The individual Black Magician cannot change the OUthrough rawforce; his is only a single, isolate will. He does possess, however, anunderstanding of how GBMworks and the consequent ability to narrow his use of it to a precise, directedfocus. It is thisfocus that enables his workings to succeed.If you have never undertaken GBM Workings before, some of the preconditions forthemmay strike you as unnecessary, even adolescent. Be patient, and you will come tosee why theyare not.You may think that you possess great powers of imagination, particularly if youhave someskill at art, music, writing, or similar form of creative expression. Consider,however, that yoursoul - which communicates with the OU through your brain - constantly receivesreinforcementof OU reality through your five physical senses. This reinforcement tends to actas a kind of“shock absorber” to your mind, cushioning and compensating for all ideas that donotcorrespond to OU parameters.What you will be doing in a formal GBM working is to change the signals whichare receivedby your five senses, bringing them into synchronization with the concept onwhich you intend tofocus. Thus you prepare for a working by constructing an artificial environmentin the OU mostclosely attuned to it: a ritual chamber.There is no “official” design, nor required contents for a Setian ritualchamber. Our ReadingList exemplifies how widely our interests vary, and a working emphasizing anyone category ofthat List [or any other concept] would require appropriate accouterments.Thus a “classic Black Mass” in the most decadent tradition of Gothic horrornovels mightrecreate the atmosphere of a gloomy, medieval crypt. A ritual utilizingspacial/dimensionalconcepts might make use of odd, Expressionistic angles, optical illusions,mirrored or irregularlighting effects, and atonal or inharmonious sound effects. Workings concernedwith space maytake place under the starry sky in a desert, where the absence of reflectedlight from cities revealsthe cosmos in all its glory ... or in planetariums, observatories, orastrophysics laboratories.The more care you take to find or create the proper environment, the more potenttheworking itself will be. This is not just because a more elaborate ritual chamberis more excitingand evocative, but also because the very act of preparing it and anticipatingthe workingcontributes to the momentum of the working proper.The “ritual chamber” is not merely the room or open area in which you operate.Theconcept extends to everything apart from your self - including your physicalbody. You must bein good health, or sufficiently in control of your mental state of being not toallow physicalmaladies to intrude upon your concentration during the working. You must beawake and alert.You must be visibly [to others, if it is a group working] and mindfully [toyourself] clothed and/or costumed as appropriate. Your goal is to exclude all sensations which clashwith the focus ofthe working, and to reinforce all sensations which enhance that focus.Address all five of the physical senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch, andtaste. At the veryleast, take steps to ensure that no distracting sensation intrudes. As youbecome increasinglyfamiliar with GBM, you will become more expert at creating environments tofacilitate it. Do notexpect to get everything exactly right the first time. And, of course, there maybe circumstancesrather beyond your complete control, such as mechanical background noise inurban areas - orcrickets in rural ones!You have prepared yourself and your ritual chamber. It is the appropriate timeof day ornight [or you have blocked out all sensory inputs dictating the time], and yourinvited assistantsand/or fellow magicians are present. You are ready to commence the workingitself.- 229 -You may use a full script or an outline, or you may proceed extemporaneously.Each hasadvantages: the script for formality and a sense of historical accuracy,extemporaneous speechfor its sincerity and spontaneity, and an outline for a blending of both. Makeyour decision noton some assumption of what you “ought” to do, but rather on the basis of whatfeels right toyou. You might use the text of a 4,000-year-old Egyptian incantation - but youmay wish tochange two words in it. Do so! Use a pre-prepared selection of gods and/ordæmons, or createsome new ones yourself. Neither type is “inauthentic”. Gods exist as they areevoked tomeaningful existence by the individual psyche.Every thought, statement, and action during the working should be directedtowards itsobject. If your preparations have been thorough, you will find that you canattain far greaterconcentration - and maintain it for a longer span of [objective or subjective]time - than yoususpect. Following the ritual you should not be surprised to feelcorrespondingly exhausted anddrained of energy.It is not uncommon for a magician to find himself carried away by a ritual he isdoing. Theexperience is so impressive, so wonderful, so overwhelming that he becomestransfixed by itboth during and following the working. There is a very simple rule of thumbwhich should beapplied in situations such as this, and it is: Bear in mind that the ritualitself is/was apersonal, SU experience. If you wish to impress other magicians with it, youmust translatethat experience into a form that is comprehensible and meaningful to them. Ifyou succeed, theywill share your interest and enthusiasm, at least to a degree. If they are notinterested orenthusiastic, do not condemn them for it. Either you have not explained itcarefully enough to dojustice to it, or it simply isn’t as relevant to their SUs as it is to yours. Ifyou becomeantagonistic or resentful, you will accomplish nothing save to lessen yourstature in their eyes.As discussed in Chapter #19, human beings are accustomed to projectingparticularpictures of themselves into others’ SUs. This is a common LBM phenomenon. In GBMthemagician does not wish to present an artificial image at all, but rather tounveil his innermostself. He is thus highly vulnerable and highly sensitive to external influences.Usually - particularly in the case of novice magicians - GBM workings are bestperformedalone. If anyone else is present, it should only be someone who is so trusted byand attuned tothe magician that no self-consciousness weakens the working. The moreindividuals present, thegreater the risk of the working deteriorating into a “living theatre” show, witheach participantpresenting an artificial image to the others.Under no circumstances should you permit anyone to be present at a GBM workingasan “observer”, “student”, “interested friend”, or even “potential Setian”. In aworking younecessarily behave in an uninhibited fashion, which will be extremelydisconcerting to someonewho is still wearing his character armor. No matter how good his intentions mayhave been, hewill still react by defensive, condescending denigration of the working. He iscompelled to dothis in order to protect and reinforce his insecure, confused self-image. Theinevitablepatronizing comments will be annoying to you, awkward for him, and certainlyunhelpful to anyordinary friendship or rapport between you.If an acquaintance wants to find out what Black Magic is like, invite him toundertake itsstudy and application personally, just as you did. If he isn’t that interested,he probably doesn’thave the self-discipline and strength of will necessary for success in BlackMagic. He will bemuch happier in some variation of a WM environment, wherein pageants and showsare all thatmatter.You undertake a GBM working because you want to understand something or becauseyou want to change something. The former type may be referred to as anillustrative working,while the latter is often called an operative working. Each takes effect byexpanding and/or- 230 -altering your SU, which then exerts a corresponding and proportionate influenceupon the OU -and other SUs - via the ML phenomenon.An OU “law” is “a statement of exclusive cause and effect”. By this exactingstandard the MLis not am OU law; nor is it consistent, reliable, or duplicatable. This isbecause it is not aninfluence or process involving only the manipulation of matter or energy in theOU, though aGBM working may include such manipulation. But the essence of GBM is its effectupon theSU(s) of the magician and/or others, which are not governed or limited by thelaws of the OU.And such SUs are inescapably the “lenses” or “windows” through which the OU isperceived,assigned significance, and interpreted. That is how and why operative GBM - andthe ML -works.Do not underestimate the subtlety and complexity of this phenomenon. To becomeadeptin GBM requires comprehensive reorientation of your attitude towards yoursensory inputs andoutputs, and the way in which you realize, signify, and process informationbetween input andoutput. It is essential that you exist, so to speak, at a far higher and moreprecise level ofconsciousness than the profane individual experiencing the same flow ofinformation. Thisgenerates great stress, which even among experienced magicians can be sustainedfor only briefconcentrations of time and effort. Start simply, and pursue more complex GBM asyou gainexperience in and a feel for it.You should never insist upon a complete alignment of related phenomena in the OUandother SUs as a result of a GBM working. Such would call for a far greaterconvergence of energyover a far greater period of OU time than a single mind can project. When youseek to causechange, therefore, look for fulcrums which need only be nudged slightly to set adesired chain-reaction in motion. Consider the most opportune times and locations for change.And do enoughpreliminary research to ascertain that the picture you have of the preexistingsituation is areasonably accurate one - else you may unknowingly change it for the worse.There is no standard sequence for a GBM working. Each is tailored to its objectand to themagician undertaking it. Setians will find many texts, instructions, and samplescenarios inTemple of Set resources such as the Jeweled Tablets, the Scroll of Set(including its back-issuecollection), and the Temple Intranet. These are tools which others have usedsuccessfully, for thespecific purposes indicated. You may use any such tool for its original purpose,or pick andchoose parts of various tools, and/or construct entirely new tools of your own.The more youwork with GBM, the more fluent you will become with these options.The Temple of Set, in keeping with this philosophy, has no “official” GBMworking rules. Itis our position that “the text of another is an affront to the self”. Thefollowing sequence is thusprovided as an example of how a GBM working might be undertaken. You may adaptit as youdesire, or you may create workings which are uniquely your own.* * * * *1. Prepare the ChamberChoose a time and location suitable to your theme, considering privacy, comfort,and itspsychological impact upon you. Decorate it as appropriate.Black is the traditional color of Black Magic [stands to reason!], because ofits mystery,solemnity, and capacity for dissolving sensory limits and barriers. Paint ordrape a room in blackand you will see that it expands rather than confines the space. Flat black ismore effective atdissolving barriers [imparting the sensation that you are “floating in space”],while gloss blackcreates a mirror-like effect that suggests an “angular matrix” about you.- 231 -Other evocative colors may be used, but avoid white, pastels, and “head shop”posters.Natural wood, earth, or stone is excellent; some of the most effective chambersare constructedfrom/in unused attics or cellars.Lighting should be by candles, fires, electric candles, or colored lightsources. Ultravioletlight may be used with great effectiveness because of the “sparkle” that itimparts to theatmosphere, the negative ions it generates, and the exotic visual effects itproduces. Avoid usingit in conjunction with predesigned UV-sensitive pictures or posters, and concealthe light-sourceif at all possible. Avoid looking directly into ultraviolet light tubes,especially forextended periods. Avoid also extensive or concentrated exposure to ozone gas,whether from UV or electrostatic-generation sources. Use minimum necessarylighting- one or two candles rather than a dozen. You can see much better insemidarkness than youthink you can. [Rituals may also be conducted wholly or partially in completedarkness, which isone way of creating an “instant ritual chamber” in the midst of an otherwiseunsuitableenvironment.]If you use recorded music, take care that it is not so rigidly sequenced thatyou have tomarch the working in time to it. Otherwise the music, not you, is conducting theworking.“Workings” designed around musical or visual effects are “pageants” and thusfall under theheading of LBM - designed to influence audiences or specific participants.An altar may be constructed out of almost anything of convenient size. When itis serving asan altar, ensure that it is not used for any other purpose. Indeed this holdstrue for all ritualimplements. A ceremonial dagger or knife will not be the worse for being used tocarve a turkeyat dinner, but in your SU you will never regard it in quite the same way if yousuffer it to be usedfor mundane purposes.Behind and above the altar should appear the Pentagram of Set in silver or redagainst ablack field. Prismatic (fresnel) material is fine for the Pentagram, and othercolors may also beused if meaningful to the magician. If any other emblem is used, as in aspecialized or historicalworking, it should be displayed either beneath the Pentagram or in anotherlocation entirely.Atop the altar should be [at minimum] a bell, a goblet or chalice (hereaftercalled the Grail),and a central flame source (which may range from a large or ornate candle to asmall oil orjellied-fuel brazier). The flame source should ideally produce a blue-black orblue flame; Sternois ideal; an electronic-lightning source such as a Tesla coil or “Eye of theStorm” will also suffice.Any texts required for a ritual may be placed upon the altar, as may additionalcandles, sword,knife, dagger, staff, and/or wand. Add whatever else you desire, from talismansand statuettes toflowers and foliage.The Church of Satan used to use a naked female as a “living altar” centerpiece,ostensibly tosymbolize carnality and the living Earth. It was a nice idea in theory, but itproved difficult inpractice. It is always awkward for one person to be nude while everyone else isclothed. Anattractive “living altar” tends to distract participants’ concentration, whilean ugly one can berepellent; and of course no two people see “beauty” and “ugliness” in the sameway. A large,sturdily-built altar platform is necessary, and sex always complicates matterswith questionsconcerning the appropriateness of male altars for female heterosexuals or malehomosexuals,etc. By all means use a “living altar” if you wish to, but don’t feel he/she isessential or evendesirable for a successful working.No protective circles or pentacles on the floor [or anywhere else] arenecessary, though youare welcome to add them for dramatic or symbolic purposes. Since the BlackMagician is at Onewith the Powers of Darkness, he needs no “protection” from them. Nor, it may besaid, are circlesor pentacles the slightest deterrent to these Powers, save in the SU of asuperstitious WhiteMagician.- 232 -Children should never be allowed to attend any GBM working. They will notunderstand it, may be frightened by it, and may wrongly represent it to others.Pets may bepresent only if they can be depended upon to enhance, not to disrupt theatmosphere.Under no circumstances is any life-form ever sacrificed or injured in a BlackMagical working of the Temple of Set. Violation of this rule will result in theoffender’s immediate expulsion and referral to law enforcement or animalprotection authorities.The purpose of this statement is to prohibit any intentional taking or injuringof life in sucha working. Obviously this applies to the bigger, more visible, more tangible,more familiarhumans and animals. But just as certainly it applies to any other life-form overwhich you haveaware, discretionary control. If you crush some captured ants, or burn a livingplant, etc. in aritual, then you are in violation of this principle.It is the element of “aware, discretionary control” that is key here, because atissue is yourrespect for the phenomenon of life per se. Beyond the reach of your senses, youcannotreasonably exercise such control, and that is that. Probably every time you openand close yourmouth while uttering incantations, you crush to death a great many microscopicresidents ofyour teeth and gums. And you are certainly not expected to perform magic only ina laboratory“clean room”! Use common sense, compassion, and especial sensitivity, and youwill fulfill theintent of this guideline.2. Dress for WorkingDress however you wish, as long as it reflects the serious atmosphere of theworking. TheTemple of Set medallion appropriate to your degree should be worn. There are nocolor or designguidelines or restriction concerning magical clothing and costumes. If a robe orcowled robe isworn, however, it should be black. Colored trim or cords for black robes, ifused, is traditionallykeyed to the Temple’s initiatory degrees: I°=white, II°=red, III°=silver,IV°=blue, V°= purple,and VI°=gold.3. Ring the BellThe bell, which should have a deep, melodious tone rather than a sharp, tinklingone, isused to formalize the beginning and end of the working. It should be tolled ninetimes, eithertowards the altar or at the four points of the compass as the magician turnscounterclockwise.The number 9 honors the Council of Nine of the Temple of Set. The magicalsignificance of thenumber 9 is also discussed in my “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” and Anton LaVey’s“TheUnknown Known” in #6L, as well as in Pythagorean lore (#12).4. Light the Black FlameThe central flame source on the altar symbolizes the Black Flame of Set, whichbroughtisolate self consciousness to higher life. It is the willful act of rekindlingthis Flame on the altarwhich opens a “Gate” of interconsciousness between the magician and the Powersof Darkness.- 233 -5. InvocationIn the name of Set, the Prince of Darkness, I enter into the Realm ofCreation to work my will upon the Universe. O Majesty of Set, hear me,look upon me, and go with me upon this journey. Enfold me with thePowers of Darkness; let them become as One with me as I am becomeOne with the Eternal Set, whose Seat is behind the Constellation of theThigh. As I send forth my most exalted and sublime Self, arm it with thePentagram of Set and with the sceptre of Tcham that it may defy allconstraints, dismay all challengers, and cast down all that is moved toappear against it.Let then my eyes become the Eyes of Set, my strength become theStrength of Set, my will become the Will of Set. As a Fire in the Darkness Iam Become; as Air in the Sky I am Become; as Earth in Space I amBecome; as Water in the Desert I am Become. I dwell in the Fane of theFlame of Ba. Time bows before my will, and I am Lord of Life, Death, andLife in Death. Hear then this Doom which I pronounce, and beware theKa which now Comes Into Being through that Art which is mine tocommand.6. Drink from the GrailThe Grail should contain any pleasing liquid, the more unusual and aromatic thebetter.The liquid need not be alcoholic and must not be blood. [The use of blood forceremonialpurposes would represent the destruction of a life-force. The magician respectsblood in itsproper vessel, the body, and does not degrade it.]The liquid may be imbibed only by the celebrant, or it may be shared with otherspresent. Ifit is to be shared, the liquid should appear initially on the altar in asuitably ornate flask, then bepoured into individual goblets or chalices by the celebrant or an assistantduring this phase ofthe working. It is not recommended that more than one participant share a singlegoblet. [Thegoblets need not match; each participant may wish to bring the one from his ownritualchamber.]In the Church of Satan the Grail was called the “Chalice of Ecstasy”, and itscontentssymbolized the elixir of life.In the Temple of Set it assumes an elder and more esoteric identity. Thepre-Christian Grailis one of the most ancient and powerful symbols of the European Black Magictradition (#14B, C,D, U). It symbolizes Truth in its purest and most sublime Form. The Grail isever sought, neverfound by the profane, for they fear Truth even when they profess otherwise.Should they chanceupon the Grail through innocence or accident, they dash it from their lips interror or, upondrinking from it, come hideously to grief for their rashness. Only the Initiateof the Left-HandPath may dare to drink from the Grail with impunity, and only he shall see itbrought forthbefore him whenever he desires. Woe to him who drinks from the Grail with deceitandfalsehood in his heart; it shall consume him utterly.“The Knights of the Grail live from a stone of purest kind.If you do not know it,It shall here be named to you.It is called lapsit exillis.”- Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parsival- 234 -“Hic lapis exilis extat precio quoque vilisSpernitur a stultis, amatur plus ab edoctis.”[This insignificant stone is indeed of trifling value.It is despised by fools, the more cherished by the wise.]- Arnold of Villanova, Rosarium Philosophorum7. Summoning of the ElementsThe magician now calls upon the living creatures and inert elements whom/whichhewishes to observe or control. He may do this by using their conventional names,or by invokingsymbols of them in isolation or combination (gods, dæmons, chemical oralchemical symbols,images, musical themes, or other media of description). He weaves around themthe appropriatecontext of his SU, thus creating what he wishes to Come Into Being.8. The WorkingUpon construction of the working environment, the magician proceeds to enter it,observewhat he desires to, and change what he wishes to. This is a precise, methodical,carefullyconceived and executed action. It is “Astral projection” in the strictest sense.(#9G/H “Liber O”,#9K)Briefly the technique is this: The magician constructs within his SU a “magicaldouble” orka (Goethe’s Doppelgänger). This is an idealized entity whose precisecharacteristics may varyfrom working to working. He then, by an act of will, transfers his soul or ba tothe vehicle of thiska and then executes his will in the SU. This may be completely disassociatedfrom the physicalbody of the magician, or it may be closely aligned with it. Physical alterationof imagery in theritual chamber may play a part, as may actions and expressions through themagician’s materialbody.At the conclusion of the working, the ba is redirected to the physical body andthe ka isdispelled. The elements of the SU specifically summoned for the working arereleased into theirnormal contexts, there to influence their OU counterparts.Vast amounts of advice concerning “Astral projection” and the construction anduse of amagical double have been proffered. There is no one best technique which worksfor everyone.You will have to experiment, turning your mind and consciousness “in uponthemselves” toexplore, understand, and control their functions and parameters. Be careful andgentle withyourself. Do not hesitate to ask the Priesthood of Set for advice if in doubt.9. Extinguish the Black Flame/Close the Gate10. Ring the Bell [as in Step #3].11. Utter the Traditional Closing Words: “So It Is Done!”* * * * *[index-235_1.jpg][index-235_2.jpg]- 235 -21: Medial Black MagicOver the years we have become accustomed to the Temple of Set’s two majordivisions ofBlack Magic: Lesser (LBM) and Greater (GBM). By the former we generally refer toapplied/scientific/manipulative magic; by the latter to introspective ceremonies ofnœtic solemnity.It is easy to focus strongly and exclusively on either one or the other of thesetwo categories,so much so that we miss that grey area wherein they blend. Let us call thisMedial BlackMagic (MBM).MBM involves the use of the magical link (ML) in its simplest, most direct formin anoperative context. Unlike LBM, in which the magician uses forces and featureswhich are of theOU to accomplish his goal, MBM has similar goals but uses metaphysical means -the ML - torealize them. It is not as “pure” as true GBM (which has no purpose other thanitself).The beauty of MBM is its simplicity and directness. It requires only so muchformality asyou feel appropriate to what you wish to do. Grimoires, spellbooks, even thefamous curse/lust/compassion rituals of the Satanic Bible are needlessly overcomplicated and arejust so muchwindow-dressing for persons who need such “training wheels” to work up a propermental/magical state of concentration.Dark Shadows, that charming occult soap-opera of the 1960s, got it right. WhenAngeliquethe witch felt the need to curse, confound, or [rarely!] help someone, she wouldsimply light acandle, or gaze into a fireplace, or stare at the Moon, and dictate her will.And so it would cometo pass. Seances and Tarot readings worked, not because they were elaboratefrauds or becausethe people participating in them were gullible fools, but because theparticipants approachedthem with simple open-mindedness.However, and this is an important point, MBM is not just “making a wish” or“saying aprayer”, because these things involve no will, nor even sincerity. MBM requiresyour will thatthe result you desire actually occur.Unlike LBM, there is no calculable cause-and-effect. If you are using proxemicmagic(LBM), you can reliably count on keeping someone in a room, driving him out ofit, altering hismood, etc. because of the physiological and psychological principles you areapplying. As a stagemagician (also LBM) you can trick or control people by things that may seem tobe MBM butaren’t.When you resort to MBM, you enter that Twilight Zone between physics andmetaphysics.The ML may or may not work, or it may work in some unexpected way [notnecessarily to yoursatisfaction]. You may try MBM and get good, regular results. You may getnowhere andconclude that, for you anyway, it is a waste of time and an intellectual insult.Or you may find it akind of mix of the two.[index-236_1.jpg][index-236_2.jpg]- 236 -Keeping MBM simple doesn’t mean that you can’t use more elaborate systems for itif youprefer. Just don’t feel that you are forced to recite some long, dreary ritualtext to accomplishsomething. A more direct ritual, which you understand and project coherently,will serve youbetter. Remember Angelique! Because in Black Magic there is no turning back.The Beginning- Mark Thornally II° (2014 CE)RenunciationNow I have taken leave of memories,I am gone down to the grey wave of prose,That not ungracious wave which ebbs and flowsIn softly pulsed irregularities,The effort breaking slowly into ease,The long, low, unimpassioned swell that goesTo the most cryptic distances one knowsOf noncommittal, silver-ebbing seas.Come over me, and cover all my mind -My truant mind - and take her into you,Grey, temperate wave, lest she be gone alongThe beach and over the hills to findThe path beneath the cypresses we knew,Or the green path that ended like a song.- Betty Ford III° (1925 CE)- 237 -Plates- 238 -[index-239_1.jpg][index-239_2.jpg][index-239_3.jpg][index-239_4.jpg]- 239 -302 East Calle Laureles, William Murray and Michael Aquino, the day of the 22nd& KansasSanta Barbara, California, meeting, San Francisco, Californiasite of the North Solstice XWorkingMeg Longoria and Robert EthelBrandy Aquino and James Lewis[index-240_1.jpg][index-240_2.jpg][index-240_3.jpg][index-240_4.jpg]- 240 -Dale Seago, Lilith Sinclair, William MurrayRobertt NeillyRoland Holt and Michael AquinoVisiting dæmon & William Murraycontemplating one another[index-241_1.jpg][index-241_2.jpg]- 241 -Jinni Bast, Marie Kelly, James LewisWillie Browning, Robert Menschel, Dale Seago[index-242_1.jpg][index-242_2.jpg][index-242_3.jpg][index-242_4.jpg]- 242 -Margaret Wendall and Betty FordYole PattersonLilith Sinclair and Jinni BastRicco Zappitelli[index-243_1.jpg][index-243_2.jpg]- 243 -Linda Reynolds, Lilith Sinclair, Michael AquinoAlexandra Sarris and Robert Menschel[index-244_1.jpg][index-244_2.jpg]- 244 -James Lewis and Dale SeagoLinda Thomas and Jerry Reynolds[index-245_1.jpg][index-245_2.jpg]- 245 -Ronald K.
