Though Dr. LaVey passed away in October of 1997, he instructed Blanche Barton, his long- time consort, to carry on as High Priestess. She appointed Peter H. Gilmore to the position of High Priest on Walpurgisnacht of 2001. We have, since 1966, stood as a formidable threat to those who would halt progress in the name of spirituality. We are explorers on the untrodden paths of science, human motivation, and mystery—all that is most truly “occult.” Those who proudly carry our cards identifying themselves as members have the strength and dedication to implement the tools of Satan: the imagination to confound and confuse, the wisdom to recognize the Unseen in our society, the pragmatism of a skeptic, and the passions of a classical Romantic soul. We don’t solicit memberships; however, if you wish to join us, to show your support or appreciation, you can become a Registered Member. For a one-time registration fee of two hundred dollars, you will receive a crimson card declaring you a member of the Church of Satan. No further dues will be expected. You must be legally an adult in your nation of residence. You’ll also receive an Active Membership Application (which is also available as a download from our offi cial site). Filling out this application indicates your more serious interest in our organization. Once you complete and return it, your fi le will be reviewed for further involvement. We have Special Interest Groups of all persuasions who are working on many fronts toward the fulfi llment of our Satanic destiny. We encourage each Satanist to take it upon himself to clear up misunderstandings of our religion wherever he sees them. You don’t have to be a member to speak for yourself as a Satanist; you need no authority beyond being offended by stupidity and hypocrisy. Understand that if you wish to speak as a member of the Church of Satan, you are legally required to be a Registered Member. In addition, don’t misrepresent yourself as being a spokesperson for the Church unless you achieve that status. But you can always defend Satanism as an avowed Satanist, proud of your religion. Prior to considering joining, we strongly suggest you purchase The Satanic Bible and study it. It is a diaboli- cal book, the basis for our philosophy. Satanism is not for everyone, but if it is for you, we welcome you. We are not a fan club, a pen-pal society, or a lonely hearts group. We are a group of dynamic individuals who stand forth as the ultimate underground alternative, the “Alien Elite.” We realize what we have, what we are, and what we shall become. Our scope is unlimited, and the extent of your involvement is based upon your own potential. All names and addresses are held in strict confi dence and you are under no obligation as a Registered Member, unless you choose to present yourself for further consideration.
