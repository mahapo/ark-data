Published first on the Internet, and later in print, the De monic Bible has had five soft cover and five hard cover editions. This is not a new edition of the Demonic Bible but rather a new volume. The first Demonic Bible contained the rituals I had de veloped over the fifteen years prior to its release. This second book of the Demonic Bi ble contains the ritu als I have developed over the past 10 years. Together, these books comprise 25 years of magical knowledge. This book assumes a familiarity with the material in the first volume. The 1 st Book of the Demonic Bible revealed the rituals for Cro ssing the Gates of Hell and becoming one with the Forces of Darkness. This 2 nd Book deals with the Qlippo th and the Kingdoms of the Black Earth. This book builds on the system of magic presented in the Demonic Bible. The Demonic Bible began with the premise th at all gods are created by man and that a devil is simply an unpopular god. The Dem onic Bible states, if power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, the omnipot ent creator of heaven and earth must be the most evil son-of-a-bitch who ever lived. Gods may be created by man, but they exist as powerful thought-forms or archetypes in the collective subconscious. Greater Black Ma gic is the manipulation of the Objective Universe by the agency of the Collective S ubconscious and by application of cause and effect in the Subjective Universe. This re quires Will, Faith, Desire, and the proper application of principles. This is a Complete Grimoire of Black Magic which will allow the reader to enter into a Covenant with Satan and to Manifest the Power of Hell. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Introduction As one who has been a Satanist & student of the occult for nearly twenty-five years, I can speak with confidence regard ing the nature and authorit y of the Dark Lord. My understanding may differ from others, just as no two people see things from the same perspective, but my knowledge is comprehensive. Our religion is not one of faith but one of certainty. We demand au thoritative proof and view all claims of divine (o r infernal) authority with heal thy skepticism. Our god is not an object of worship but a symbol of defi ance against man-made gods and institutions. My name is well known in the Satanic Commun ity. I have been praised, adored, cursed, and reviled. And yet, I care not what any ma y think. My philosophy speaks for itself. My words stand on their own merit. Those who sp eak against me or who make themselves my enemies act towards their own destructi on and serve to exalt my name further. This book is written for Satanists rather than non-Satanists and so I will dispense with logical arguments on the validity of Satani c Philosophy and get quickly to the points I wish to make. Over the years, I have made many arguments defending Satanic Philosophy and have read others essays. These arguments are benefici al to non-Satanists. They are designed to create doubt in the mi nd of god-adorers and to draw new souls to Satan. They are not, however, dictations of dog ma which Satanists must live their lives by. While the opinion expressed in these articles may sometimes differ, there is no genuine conflict between LaVeyan Satanism, Spiritual Satanism, Luciferanism, or Setianism. Left-Hand-Path Philosophy recognizes that man has the potential to become a “god”. This is expressed in Deitic Philosophy as the Law of the Aeon of Lucifer, Thelema, Xeper, Deitus or Will to come into being as a God. Everything written regarding Satanism is conjecture. There is no central dogma which must be accepted on blind faith. Satanists are free to believe as they wish. Satanism is the modern form of an ancien t inverse religion. Ever y society has had its devil and its devil-worshippers. He has been called Satan, Set, Tiam at, Ktullu, Astaroth, Moloch, and a thousand names. He represents th e inverse of God in a ll nations and in all times. Whatever argument we may make to defend Satanic Philosophy, the Satanist is a Satanist because he is drawn to the I nverse Deity which defies God and rejects conventional society. This attraction to Dar kness is solely the di stinction of being a Satanist. If, as some Satanists claim, there is no G od, then there is no reason to call ourselves Satanists. The atheist-Satanist makes a great argu ment but if he is correct, then he is an atheist and not a Satanist? If he feels that dogma is important to his psyche but that God doesn’t exist, there is no reas on he cannot continue practicing a religion (like Christianity or Judaism) while realizing it false. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"If Satan is the true God, as others may cl aim, then His name would be God not Satan (Satan means enemy or adversary and is trad itionally either the enemy of God or the enemy of man.) If there is a God, but Christ ians are wrong in their beliefs, then some other religion, such as Buddhism or Zoroastria n, is the correct faith. There is no reason to exalt the enemy of God in d eclaring oneself a Satanist. We must conclude that since Satanists exist, and have existed in every so ciety, Satanism is an independent religion and that the attraction to darkness which binds one to the Inverse Deity is a spiritual calling. Logically, the Devil may or may not exist. If He exists, it may be as a powerful thought- form or as a product of the Collective Subcons cious (this I suggest in the first book of the Demonic Bible.) The Devil may, however, pre-exist man as a being distinct from the universe. Set is considered one of the Nete rs of ancient Egypt in Setian or Sethian Philosophy. Whatever the Devil may be, we are drawn to Him as the archetype of carnality and of the psyche. This is what defi nes us as Satanists and which separates us from agnostic atheist humanists or eclectic pagan hedonists. And so, here we are...followers of the Dark Lord . Does it matter if he is real, or simply a product of our collective subconscious? We are drawn to Satan as others are to Christ, Vishnu, or Buddha. He is Our God and Our Fath er. We exalt the Name of Satan. We turn to Him, as Our God and Master. Why should we separate ourselves into branches or denominations? Why should we declare one path true and reject the way chosen by others as false? Do we know the mind of the Dark Lord? Are we able to transcend death and arise as demons of flesh? Throughout history, there have always been Dark Souls drawn to the Inverse Deity. There has never been more than a few in each nation. Only larger cities have had the population to give birth to groups of Satani sts. The creation of the Internet made it possible for the first time that millions of people could communicate quickly. Because of this incredible change to human communication, there is fo r the first time in history a worldwide community of Satanists. Satanists have called for Unity and for the creation of a Satanic Community. The Satanic Community already exists. It exists in me ssage boards and websites across the ‘Net. The difficulty this community faces is that it is divided within itself. There is no central authority. There is no unifying dogma. There is no doctrine that Satanists agree upon. There is no reconcilia tion of theological conflicts. The Satanic Community exists in highly fragmented and chaotic form. This is a Call-To-Arms, This is a call for Unity. Arise! Guardians of the Black Flame! Step forward, all those who live in the Devil’ s Fane! The Goat of Mendes is calling. The Dark Lord is beckoning! The servants of the Dark Lord are called to unite in a Brotherhood of Darkness, and to bring forth evil and terror upon the earth. Unite Servants of Hell, that the Dark Lord may execute His judgment! "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Concerning the Left-Hand-Path I need hardly point out that all magic is \"satan ic\". The very act of e ffecting change in the universe according to one's will falls under th e definition of the LHP (Left-Hand-Path) and Black Magic. If you wish to delude yourself that you are serving God by conjuring demons and commanding them to do your will, by all means do so, but do not expect anyone to believe this the case. I have crossed the abyss and have seen the tw ilit world which exists beyond. In this place, there was no god or Satan, only a world where ti me stood still and illusion had substance. I experienced this once, not in a dream or fa ntasy, but in the real world. Panic and horror nearly consumed me, but an amulet in the form of an Egyptian ankh helped me to find my way back. In the ten years since, I have sought to understand this experience. Perhaps it was a \"psychotic break\" from reality, but I am unabl e to believe this, even though such a belief would give a greater sense of ease. The abyss is real. It exists ar ound us. Our lives do not end with death, but continue in a realm unseen by mortals. If I could believe, as you, that God is loving and kind and that the good people go to heaven, such belief would give peace and rest until such time as death overtook me. But god is not so and heaven does not exist. If power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, then the omnipotent creator is th e most corrupt of all beings. We live in a world which is satanic and all gods are daemons . Of course, there is the satanic and the satanic, the one is proclaimed as holy. Do I blaspheme creation? Do I reject God? I love God. I embrace him. The elemental god of the Hebrews (YHVH) who swallowed Ko rah whole into the ground, who brought the locusts upon Egypt by a strong ea st wind, who appeared in a p illar of fire by night, and who destroyed the earth with a flood, is the most evil and earthly of all beings. Jesus Christ, who rejected hypocrisy and self-deceit, was one of the great Satanic Masters of the World. I greet him in the name of Satan and in the name of Lucifer."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Concerning the Covenant An Aeonic Word is simply an expression of a concept. The formulation of a Law is the task of a magus. Examples of this are Alei ster Crowley's famous axium \"Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law\" or Michael Aquino's \"Xeper Xepera ...\" A covenant is a pact, or an agreement. In this context, a covenant implies both sovereignty and equality. When nations sign treaties, for example, there is defacto recognition of sovereignty and self-determina tion. There is also recognition of equality between the parties. In the Abrahamic religions, God is said to have made a Covenant with Man. This seems to me more LHP than RHP since this im plies recognition on God's part of man's sovereignty and equality (with God.) A covenant is also found in the Witch's pact with Satan, found in literature from throughout the Middle Ages. The meaning of Covenant extends beyond simply an agreement between two parties, to a system of law or the structure of society. Society is constructed upon laws and codes of conduct which are based on traditions and values. The Latin Word for agreement also meant \"Federation\" and extended to all citizens of the Roman Empire. The Word Covenant is found in \"Coven,\" si gnifying a group of w itches. The entire construct of society and law, from a group of witches who meet to celebrate the Sabbat, to a nation or a people, is built upon a social contract and therefor e a \"covenant\" between men. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Concerning Dimensions I rejected God and Satan a long time ago, but then found that both exis t, just not in the way people imagine. I think that true knowledge of God begins with a rejection of God and all things related to God... there's just too much attachment in re ligion to culture and tradition. It is only when you free yourself from the idea of who God is, that you can begin to see what God really is. Anyway, we can say that the 0 dimension is an infinitely small point , without length or width, and the 1st dimension is an infinite line with an infinite numb er of points on it. We can say that the 2nd dimension is an infinite plain containing an infinite number of lines side-by side, and that the 3rd dimension is an infinite number of planes existing side-by- side. We can say that the 4th dimension cont ains an infinite numb er of 3 dimensional universes and that the 5th dimension contai ns an infinite number of 4 dimensional universes, etc. Einstein established that physical objects ha ve 4 dimension (lengt h, width, height, and time,) since they have a finite existence in time with a be ginning and an ending, but the 4th dimension must contain an infinite num ber of 3 dimensional universes. In the 4th dimension, time is non-linear (although we percei ve time as linear with cause and effect.) Essentially, each differentiated psyche exists in a subjective universe in which it moves freely into the past (memories) and the futu re (dreams) and experi ences a point in time that it calls \"now\". Each person, therefore, is a parallel 4 di mensional universe, in the 5th dimension of thought. The 5th dimension is that of the psyche and in the 6th dimension, we could say that all differentiated psyches are one. An example of this is that when you dream, you have a number of experiences. You may talk with various people and interact with vari ous creatures. In the dream, you play a role, but all the characters are created by your own mind. Therefore, you are the one speaking and the one hearing. It is the same mind wh ich creates each character in the dream. Thus, all conflicts on earth are between one manifestation of the One and another manifestation of the One. Considering that we are all projections of the same Mind, it is amazing that people can't get along. But conflict (as in dreams) seems to be the process by which the One comes to self-realization. The dynamic consciousness of the universe which is manifest within the Satanist, ach ieves self-rea lization through the dialectic process of thesis/anti-thesis/synthesis. Th is \"Awakening\" of the individual has been interpreted as \"spiritual enlighten ment\", \"gnosis\", \"nirvana,\" etc. Whatever we believe true, becomes true, as we are our own gods and there is really nothing beyond thought. But, if I believe in God and Satan, then God and Satan are real. If I believe in Jupiter, Zeus, and Athena, then they are real. It is all a question of perspective. If the 5th dimension is thought , then the 6th dimension must contain an infinite number of parallel 5 dimensional unive rses. Thus, we may all be manifestations"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of the One which sleeps, but there also is that which is Without, consciousness outside the One, and alien to our being. I think few are ready to approach Satanism from such a perspectiv e. Look at how many reject the \"Aeonic\" concepts of Thelema, Xeper, Remanifestation, and Runa when these are really quite simple next to the concept of infinity wh ich is raised by the suggestion that all minds are manifestated by the One. The formula I give in the Demonic Bible is Th elema, Xeper, Deitus or \"Will to come into being as a God.\" This is the approach I took, but there are others which are equally valid. There is Xeper and Remanifest, or Essent Into Essence. There is also The All is One and the One is All, the Law of Unity, and th e Word Thiannen which means to \"become visible.\" Of course, from a Gnostic perspective, an ae on is a being from the 'fullness' outside the prison-world we exist, which influences for a period of time. In this view, only one aeon is active at a time. Many have since come to believe that an aeon is a state of mind and that they overlap. To say that this is the Aeon of Lucifer, gnostically refers to the period we have entered in which this being now influences the world, although he is from the fullness beyond our prison-world. The first time I experienced what I would now call \"gnosis\", I was 18. I had come into contact with a daemon (which revealed itse lf as Azael.) It communicated to me the Demonic Bible, but I began to identify with the spirit to the point where my consciousness became one with it. For a period of time, I began to believe that I was Azael and that I was one of 666 fallen ange ls who were manifested upon the earth and that these beings were ancient alie n souls that would one day unite. The idea that I was not 'human' had already b een planted many years earlier, when I was 13. It was a difficult time, for I questioned my sanity greatly, but I knew then that I had a special destiny. I would lie awake at night and talk to 'God', not in prayer but simply in my mind. when I asked for something, it w ould happen. It would always happen. I can remember thinking to myself that I was a me ssenger of God of Jesus Christ returned, and then thinking that I was not pure enough to be a messenger from God, but was rather the antichrist. I look back now and see daemonic activity in my life even as a child. Now, I am Tsirk Susej, antichrist, servant and desciple of the Dark Lord. I am the author of the Demonic Bible, and the founder of the Embassy of Lucifer. I have written several books on Satanism. I am not saying this to st ate the obvious, or to seem arrogant, but rather to suggest once again that the past, pres ent, and future all co-exist. What I am now, I always was, and demonic activity in my childhood is therefore easily explained but virtue of who I was and who I would become. So, I return to the Word Xeper (\"become\".) As I may travel along the road, the road is the same, the horizon is the same, the sun rising is the same. But the movement along that"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"road is my Xeper, and the point at which I stand is my Remanifestation. Runa is that which I seek beyond the horizon of my vision, th e Dark Grail, and Xem is the realization that \"I AM\" (It is the sun itself or me as I st and facing it.) Thelema is the resolve I have to walk the road, the Will which makes the Great Work (the Grail Quest) possible. Indulgance is the enjoyment which I receive as I pursue my goal (the Grail.) The sun in its rising is Xeper-Ra (Xepera) ju st as Amon-Ra is the sun in its underworld aspect. Amon was associated with Ra in late r times, but was also th e \"breath of life\" and a god of fertility. Arkte is the life-force wh ich exists in all living things and which connects all things (Amon-Ra). Essent is \" gnosis\" or awareness of self and connection with something greater than the self. Thiannen is the sun in its rising or the psyche in its awakening. \"I have become vi sible\", cries the initiate. Un ity is the knowledge that all things are One. Chaos is the knowledge of oppos ition and that all things are divided, both One and many."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The 69 Thesis on Indulgence A Commentary on Heretical Satanism & Temple DEITUS Heretical Satanism In a religion as individualistic and unorthodox as Satanism, what does it mean to be a heretic? Can someone be a here tical Satanist? The answer to this is “yes”. A Heretical Satanist is a Satanist who believes in and worships God. Now, you might ask how this would happen. Why would a Sata nist worship God? There ar e several possible reasons. The first is that the individual turned towa rds Satanism as a rejection of conventional religion but did not reject G od. The second is that the indi vidual has become disgusted with the hypocrisy and self-ri ghteousness of the right-hand- path and no longer views God within the traditional religious context. The third possibility is that the individual has come to see Satan as a more perfect representa tion of God. The fourth possibility is that the individual is attracted to dark and daemonic symbolism and pursues Satanism from a purely aesthetic perspective. LaVeyan Satanism and Modern Satanism reject the existence of God or Satan. Within the Church of Satan and other LaVeyan or Modern Satanism Groups, Satan is seen simply as a metaphor for man’s carnality and brutality. Traditional Satanism and Spiritual Satanism acknowledge the litera l existence of Satan but also adopt the view that Satan is the enemy of God. Within Theological Satanism and Sp iritual Satanism, Sata nists reject God and declare their allegiance to Satan as th e enemy. Heretical Satanism, by contrast, acknowledges God as Soverei gn, and does not reject God. Ra ther, Heretical Satanism proclaims the Glory of God’s Kingdom. For the Heretical Satanist, Satan is the archetype or intermediary to God, in much the way that Christians approach God through Jesus Christ. Traditional Satanism has often been described as an an ti-religion. Heretical Satanism is a religion. Israel and the God of the Old Testament The Old Testament Biblical religion is not wh at is today called Judaism. Judaism is the surviving religion of just one of the tribes of Israel, namely the tribe of Judah. Concerning the religion of the Israelites, the Aronic Pr iesthood no longer exists, the Ark of the Covenant is no longer the center of worship, the p eace sacrifices are no longer offered in the tabernacle, and the Holy of Holies is no longer sanctified. The religion of Israel has been lost. Judaism has a rabbinica l tradition which descends from the Pharisees of the time of Jesus. The Rabbis consider in terpretation of the Law more important than obedience to the Law. While the Law is an important aspect of Judaism, Rabbinical Tradition has applied the Law of Moses to ever y aspect of life. The Talmud (the writings of religious leaders) holds equal importance to the Torah (the Law, the Holy Book.) In the religion of the Israelites, there was no belief in the Devil. God was seen as the author of all things, good and evil. There was also no belief in an afterlife (heaven or"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"hell) or in an eternal soul. The serpent in th e Garden of Eden was not seen as evil, and there was no original sin or need for salvati on from sin. This life was considered the one of importance. God’s first commandment was to procreate or to “go forth and multiply.” Sex was not sinful. The Laws of God were established to show how men should live together in peace, without harming one anothe r. Obedience to the Law was necessary for a harmonious and good life, not because obedi ence guaranteed eternity in heaven. The religion of the Israelites bear s little resemblance to Juda ism or Christianity today. The God of the Old Testament was revealed as Jehovah or Yahweh. Yahweh is the phonetic pronunciation of the four letters Y- H-V-H, the word which God spoke at the moment of creation. The Israelites became f earful of speaking this sacred name and instead used the name Adonai (Lord). The scri bes interspersed the vowels from the name Adonai between the consonants Y-H-V-H, crea ting the name Jehovah, as a reminder that Adonai was to be used in place of Yahweh. The mystical beliefs became part of the Hebrew Cabala. Essentially, God is infin ite and beyond human comprehension. Yahweh is the word God spoke at the moment of creat ion, therefore the physic al manifestation of the Infinite God. Throughout the Old Testament, God (Yahweh) appears in elemental manifestations. He appears in a burning bush to Moses and as a pi llar of fire by night to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. He causes the wind to blow all night, parting the Red Sea, and later bringing the locusts upon Egypt. He destroys the earth with a Flood and divides the earth to swallow Korah, Dathan, and Abiram alive. The Cabalists identified the letters Y-H-V- H with the alchemical elements Earth, Ai r, Fire, and Water. From a “Satanic” perspective, the Yahweh equates to Belial (Earth), Lucifer (Air), Satan (Fire), and Leviathan (Water), the Four Crown Princes of Hell. The early Hebrews also knew God as ‘El’, a name derived from Ellil or Enlil. God says, “Obey my angel, for my name is in Him.” The angels have names ending in “El”. Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Azazel... Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, was given the name Israel, which means “prince with God,” and Jacob named the place where god wrestled with him Peniel. To the Phoenician -Canaanites, ‘El’ was ‘God Most High.’ He was the father of Baal and th e other gods. Baal is derived from Bel, which was a name given to the Babylonian Mar duk, Son of Enki. These names are all derived from the Sumerian/ Akkadian religion. Melchizedek was a priest of El or ‘God Most High’ and represented the earlier prie sthood, which predated the Ar onic Priesthood. Abraham came to view all such gods as th e creation of man. In the reli gion of Abraham and the later Israelites, the worship of idols was strictly forbidden and ‘El’, or ‘God Most High’ was to be worshipped over all gods. This was not to sa y that other gods did not exist, but rather that they were not to be worshipped. Salem (or Jerusalem) was a Holy City of the Phoenician/Canaanites prior to David conquering it and it becoming the Holy City of the Israelites. A nother religion which derives from the religion of the Israelites is Samaritanism. After the conquest of Israel by Babylon, the people of Israel were relocat ed throughout the Babylonian Empire and people from other lands were moved to Isr ael. The various Assyrians, Egyptians, and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"other races which were brought to Israel b ecame known as the Samaritans. These are the Samaritans mentioned in the New Testament. Samaritanism continued many of the sacrifices and practices described in the Old Testament. The name Samaritan means “keeper of the Law” and they claim to pr actice the Law of the Torah. They did not, however, have access to the Holy City of Jeru salem so adopted as their holy city Mount Gerizim. Nazarenes and the God of the New Testament When Jesus claimed to be the “living water”, the “bread of life”, and the “I AM”, he was identifying himself with Yahweh of the Ol d Testament. The mystery of Christ, which most Christians do not realize, is that Jesus wa s the Infinite Deity manifest in the flesh. If Mary was a virgin or simply a young wome n does not matter. Greek Mythology has many virgin-births, and Christ took on thes e roles. In various cultures, he became synonymous with Baal/ Tammuz/ Dmuzu/ Mithra s/ and Adonai. To the Greeks, he was Apollo, the Son of Zeus and his worship repl aced the worship of the Sun God. To the Romans, he was Lucifer, the Light-Bearer. By his descent into the underworld, he becomes the Lord of Hell. To those w ho accuse him of performing miracles by Beelzebub, he simply states a nation divided must fall. In truth, Jesus is Baal (son of El), who is Bel, or Marduk (son of Enki). Three thousand years before the birth of Christ, the Egyptians celebrated December 25 th as the birth of Horus. The god Osiris was slain on the Winter So lstice, passed through the underworld for three nights, and finally was reborn in the form of Horus. The bride of Osiris, Isis, was referred to as the Mother of God, a title which would be given to the Virgin Mary. In Christianity, Ma ry took over the role of Isis, Jesus the role of Horus, and God the Father the role of Osirus. December 25 th , was also the birth of Mithras. Mithraism was widespread in the Roman Empire at the same time that Christianity began to spread as well. Whereas Mithraism was secr etive and exclusive, Christianity appealed to the masses. An argument could easily be made that Christ and Mithras were synonymous and that the two religions presented the same story in two distinct ways: one secretive, the other open. The New Testament re veals that Christ told his disciples certain things were to be said in secret. To the Heretical Satanist, Chri st is the modern form of an ancient pagan fertility deity. His teachings also reveal much Satanic Wi sdom. Christ condemned the churches and religious leaders of his time as hypocrites a nd vipers manipulating people for their own ends, making money off the poor, serving onl y their own interests. Jesus Christ’s statements about “turning the other cheek” and forgiving wrongs may seem un-Satanic, but he also states that he “did not come to bring peace, but a sword” and further to “cast into the furnace” those who do not repent. W ho was this message directed at? Who was he threatening with Hell-fire? Not the prost itutes or the drug-addict s to whom he went with the message of a better life, but ra ther the self-righteous paragons of pious religiosity who held the reigns of power in their hands and who bore the weight of their hypocrisy and self-deceit. It is the religious leaders of his tim e (and our own) that Christ condemned as propagators of pl agues and purveyors of poverty."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Jesus may have never lived. His teachings, contained in the Sermon on the Mount, may have been derived from the teachings of B uddha, Zoroaster, Krishna, or Mithras. All of the myths surrounding his death and resurrect ion may have been adopted from Pagan Mythology. For our purpose, it does not matter if he existed, but rath er that there were people who followed his teachings and who were known as Nazarenes. Christ condemned the hypocrisy of his time. He saw th at the leaders of the Jewish Religion had abandoned the Law of Moses. The preached the coming of a new kingdom. The Messiah was expected to return and to build God’ s Kingdom on Earth. Christ’s teachings have since been corrupted and ha ve spawned numerous cults. Mahommedans & the God of Islam The Arab people were noble-born, descendents of Abraham. They practiced the law of circumcism, but had fallen away from the other laws of God. They worshipped strange idols and sacrificed to strange gods in their land. By 666 AD, the Gentiles, who had received the benefit of the Gospel, the teachings of Paul and the other apostles, had turned away from Christ. The Emperor of Ro me had renamed himself as Pope and across Europe terrible crimes were committed in the name of Christ. The Beast which St. John foresaw in his revelation to the churches ha d come, and had established himself as the Pope of Rome. When Mahommed came to unite the Arab tribes and reestablish the worship of one god, Christians had broken thei r Covenant with God. The rise of Islam and invasion of Europe would later bring enlightenment back to the Western World in the form of the Reformation. An interesting note concerning Islam is the black stone which serv es as an object of worship in the Kiblah. As legend goes, the ston e fell to earth from the heavens. This has led many to believe it may be of extra-terristeri al origin. The reality, however, is that this stone was an ancient pagan object of worship. As with Christianity, Islam was based on many ancient pagan rites. Sorcery and magic pl ayed a great role in Arabian legends (as an example read 1001 Arabian Nights.) It is from Koran in which we read that Solomon binded 72 Lords of the Djinn in a brazen vess el and obtained his wealth and power from his control of these demons. The corruption of Christianity or Islam was not in the incorporation of pagan symbolism (for these pa gan beliefs are equally holy) but rather in turning against the teachings of thei r founder and against the laws of god. The Infinite Deity If two men pass on opposite sides of an object , they will two different things although they see the same object. One may only see th e blue and green coloring on the left side and the other see the red and white coloring on the other side . One may see the object as “small” and the other as “large,” dependent on perception and frame of reference. When each describes what he has seen, the descrip tions they give will be quite different. One says, “I saw a large blue-green mass” while the other says “it was a red and white miniature.” Both are right, in regard to circumstance and impression, but both wrong by limitation. Similarly, a physicist may speak of a person as a single body, a biologist as"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"hundreds of living cells, a chemist as billions of atoms, a mi nister as a spiritual being. Each is correct. The only error is to believe that everyone el se wrong. The Infinite Deity is beyond human comprehension. No man has ever seen the face of God and lived. To accept one prophet as a messenger of God is to accept the possibility that every other may be valid. If the gods speak to man, and if one is speaks truth, then any could be a messenger. There is a spiritual thinking involve d in this, and an element of faith, but if the Torah is true, then why not the Gospel s? Why not the Koran? the Book of Mormon? the Gnostic Gospels? OASPE? the Emerald Tablet of Thoth? Ch ristians refer to the Bible as the “living word” but the bible is a collection of books put together by the Catholic Church. They carefully decided in the Council of Nicea, which books belonged and which did not. The “word” is a living spirit , it is what the Gnostics called the “Logos” and the Sikhs call the “Naam.” St. John refers to the Christ as the “Word born Flesh,” but the word is not confined to the few books wh ich were approved by the Catholic Church. It is the word which is revealed to man in all generations. The Annunaki The ancient people knew the gods as the A nnunaki. The Sumerians knew them as the Elder Gods and the Israelites knew them as the Elohim. El was synonymous with Ellil or Enlil and Adonai with Enki or Ea. The Christian demi-god, Jesus, was synonymous with Bel or Marduk, whom the Hebrews had been fo rbidden to worship. It has been believed that the gods once walked among men, in the lands of Sumer, Chaldea, and Egypt. As described in the Book of Genesis and in the Book of Noah, the \"sons of god\" mated with the children of man and had children with them. Human civilizati on is the result of interaction between the Annunaki and man. Ot hers have suggested the interaction of aliens with the ancient world and have attributed the incredible advancement of man and the \"missing link\" of evolution to an gene tic breeding program carried out by an alien intelligence. Setians understand this interaction as the \"Gift of Set.\" The 4th Covenant If we accept that Aleister Crowley succeeded in establishing contact with the Annunaki and that Liber Al Vel Legis is a revelation from the Elder Gods, then we may rightly understand the revelation of thelema as a four th covenant. The first covenant includes the priests or magi of Zoroaster, descendents of the priest-kings of Chaldea, from whose name comes the titles magician and magus, and also the prophets or seers of the Hebrew people. The second covenant includes the apostles of Christ, the gnostics, and the mystery schools of Greece and Rome. The th ird covenant includes Islam, with its mystical suffi's, Yezidism, Sikhism, Babi'sm, and Bahai'ism. The 4th Covenant incorporates the Aeon of Horus, Aeon of M aat, Age of Satan, Aeon of Set, and Aeon of Lucifer. This is, of course, a generalization, since w ithin each Covenant period, we could point to individual covenants. The Ch ristian Bible mentions Seth, Enoch, Noah, Salah, Abram, Israel, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, David, and Solo mon as establishing a covenant with God. There are many others from other religions w ho could be mentioned. Is it possible that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the Liber Al Vel Legis and the Book of Co ming Forth By Night come from the same preternatural intelligence which establishe d a covenant with Abram and later with Moses? Herein lies a great mystery regardi ng religious truth and th e nature of revelation, a mystery which could seriously shatter the fa ith of those who believe blindly in this church or that church. Churches have a vest ed interest in claiming sole authority in spiritual matters. No religious leader wants to admit that th e others may be equally right or that they may be wrong in some aspect of what they believe. To place Thelema, Maat- Magic, Satanism, and Setianism on the same fo oting, is dangerous to the self-righteous. Every religion has had two seperate branches : one dogmatic and fundamentalist, the other mystic and universal. While fundamentalis t Jews await the coming messiah, those who embraced the mystical elements of Judaism recognized the legitimacy of the Christian revelation. Christian Fundamentalist similarl y awaited the return of Christ, while Gnostics embraced the truth of Islam. Mys ticism and magic underly all religions and connect religion, whereas fundamentalism sepe rates religion by culture and ethnicity. There is, beneath all religions, an underlying layer of religious and spiritual truth which unites humanity. The Law God’s commandment to Adam and again to Noah was to “go forth and multiple” and “to have dominion over the earth.” This Covenant gives man authority over the earth to command all things and to govern according to his desire. God’s covenant with Abram gave his seed possession of all the lands of Canaan. God’s covenant with the children of Israel, established them as a “nation of priests.” God’s covenant through Christ established that man should be “Son and Co-h eir with God.” The theme throughout is one of nobility and divine birth-right, not one of poverty and self-doubt. If we analyse the significance of Covenant or treaty, we see th e in it an implication of equality and sovereignty. If two parties ar e not equal and sovereign, they can make an agreement. One would simply take from the other what he de sired. To accept the idea of a covenant with God is to accept that we are sovereign beings on equal standing with God. To the Gnostics, the serpent in the garden was not “evil” but rather represented gnosis. The serpent says, “in the day you eat ther eof, you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” Prior to this, there could be no covena nt between the gods and man, since man was not equal with god. After receiving gnosis, ma n became sovereign. It is often said that man was cast out of paradise, but with sove reignty comes responsibility. Man could not remane in the allegorical “Garden of Eden” and also be sovereign. With sovereignty and equality, he would have to leav e paradise. It is not a matter of “original sin” but rather part of God’s design, that man should b ecome a god upon the earth and hold dominion over all things. This is our covenant.

In 1904, Crowley dictated Liber Al vel Legis or the Book of the Law, a revelation from the ancient Egyptian Neters: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hur-Kuit. Several other texts, including the Vision and the Voice may be considered as the Holy Books of Thelema, but this Book of the Law is the core revelation which established the Aeon of Horus.

The Book of Satan (“Might Is Right”) I In this arid wilderness of steel and st one, I raise up my voice that you may hear! To the East and to the West I beckon. To th e North and to the South I show a sign proclaiming, \"Death to the weak ling, wealth to the strong.\" Open your eyes that you may see, Oh men of mildewed minds and listen to me ye laborious millions! For I stand forth to ch allenge the wisdom of the world; to interrogate the \"laws\" of ma n and of \"God.\" I request reasons for your Golden Rule and ask the why and wherefore of your Te n Commands. Before none of your printed idols do I bend in acquiescence and he who saith \"thou shalt\" to me is my mortal foe! I demand proof over all things, and accept with reservations even that which is true. I dip my forefinger in the watery blood of your impotent mad-redeemer and write over his thorn-torn brow \"The true Prince of Evil - the king of the Slaves!\" No hoary falsehood shall be a truth to me - no cult or dogma shall encramp my pen. I break away from all conventions. Alone, untrammelled, I raise up in stern invasion the standard of the strong. I gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah and pluck him by the beard - I uplift a broad axe and split open his worm-eaten skull. I blast out the ghastly conten ts of philosophically whited sepulchres and laugh with sardonic wrath. Then, reaching up from the fe stering and varnished facades of your haughtiest moral dogmas, I write thereon in letters of blaz ing scorn; \"Lo and behold, all this is fraud!\" I deny all things! I question all things! And yet! And yet! Gather around me O' ye death-defiant and the earth itself shal l be thine, to have and to hold. II All ethics, politics and philosophies ar e pure assumptions, built upon assumptions. They rest on no sure basis. They are but shadowy castles in the air erected by daydreamers, or by rogues, upon nursery fables. It is time they were firmly planted upon an enduring foundation. This can never be accomplished until the racial mind has been thoroughly cleansed and drastically disinfected of its depraved, alien and demoralizing concepts of right and wrong. In no human brain can sufficient space be found for the relentless logic of hard fact, unt il all pre-existent delusions have been finally annihilated. Half-measures are of no avail. We must go down to the very root"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"and tear them out, even to the last fibre. We must be, like nature, hard, cruel, relentless. Too long the dead hand has been permitted to sterilize living thought -- too long, right and wrong, good and evil, have been i nverted by false prophets. In the days that are at hand, neither creed nor code must be accepted upon authority, human, superhuman or \"divine.\" (Morality a nd conventionalism are for subordinates.) Religions and constitutions are all arbitrar y principles, every mortal theorem, must be deliberately put to the que stion. No moral dogma must be taken for granted -- no standard of measurement deified. There is nothing inherently sacred about moral codes. Like the wooden idols of long ago, they are all the work of human hands, and what man has made, man can destroy. He that is slow to believe anything and everything is of great understanding, for belief in one false principle is the beginning of all unwis dom. The chief duty of every new age is to up-raise new men to determine its liberties, to lead towards its material success - to rend (as it were) the rusty padl ocks and chains of dead custom that always prevent healthy expansion. Theori es and ideals and constitutions, that may have meant life and hope and freedom for our ancestors, may now mean destruction, slavery and dishonor to us. As environmen ts change no human ideal standeth sure. Wherever, therefore, a lie has built unto itself a throne, let it be a ssailed without pity and without regret, for under the do minance of a falsehood, no nation can permanently prosper. Let established sophi sms be dethroned, rooted out, burnt and destroyed, for they are a standing menace to all true nobility of thought and action. Whatever alleged \"truth\" is proven by resu lts to be but an empty fiction, let it be unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness, among the dead gods, dead empires, dead philosophies and other useless lumber and wreckage. The most dangerous of all enthroned lies is the holy, the sanctif ied, the privileged lie -- the lie that \"everybody\" believes to be a model truth. It is the fruitful mother of all other popular errors and delusi ons. It is hydra-headed. It ha s a thousand roots. It is a social cancer. The lie that is known to be a li e is half eradicated, but the lie that even intelligent persons regard as a sacred fact -- the lie that has been inculcated around a mother's knee -- is more dangerous to c ontend against than a creeping pestilence. Popular lies have ever been the most potent enemies of personal li berty. There is only one way to deal with them. Cut them out, to the very core, just as cancers are. Exterminate them root and branch, or they will surely eat them all up. We must annihilate them, or they will us. III He who saith unto himself, \"I must believe , I must not question\" is not a man but a mere pusilanimous mental gelding. He w ho believes \"because it has been handed down\" is a fool in his folly. Sagacious spir its doubt all things, and hold fast only to that which is demonstrably true. The rules in life are not to be found in Korans, Bibles, Decalogues and Constitutions, but rather the rules of de cadence and death. The \"law of laws\" is not written in Hebrew consonants or upon tables of brass and stone, but in every man's own heart. He who obeys any standard of right and wrong, but the one set up by his own conscience, betrays himself into the hands of his enemies, who are ever laying in wait to bind him to their millstones."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"\"I rest my hopes on nothing\" proclaimed Goethe, and masterful minds in all ages have never done otherwise. This unspoken t hought gives to all truly great men their manifest superiority over the brainless, vociferating herd. The \"common people\" have always had to be fooled with some written or wooden or golden Idol -- some constitution, declaration or gospel. Conse quently, the majority of them have ever been mental thralls, living and dying in an atmosphere of strong illusion. They are befooled and hypnotized even to this hour, a nd a large portion of them must remain so, until time is no more. Indeed the masses of mankind are but the sediment from which all the more valuable elements have long ago been distil led. They are totally incapable of real freedom, and if it was granted to them, they would straightway vote themselves a master, or a thousa nd masters within twenty-four hours. Mastership is right -- Mastership is natural -- Mastership is eternal. But only for those who cannot overthrow it and trample it beneat h their hoofs. Is it not a fact that in actual life, the ballot-box votes of ten m illion subjective personalities are as thistle down in the balance, when weighed agai nst the far seeing thought and material prowess of, say, ten strong silent men? IV \"Love one another\" you say is the supreme law, but wh at power has made it so? Upon what rational authority do es the Gospel of Love re st? Is it even possible in practice and what would result from its uni versal application to active affairs? Why should I not hate mine enemies, and hunt th em down like the wild beasts they are? Again, I ask why? If I \"love\" them does that not place me at their mercy? Is it natural for enemies to \"do good\" unto each other and, what is \"good?\" Can the torn and bloody victim \"love\" the blood-splashed jaws that rend him limb from limb? Are we not all predatory animals by instinct? If humans ceased wholly from preying upon each other, could they continue to exist? \"Love your enemies and do good to them that hate and despitefully use you,\" is the despicable philosophy of the sp aniel that rolls upo n its back, when kicked. Obey it, O' reader, and you and all your posterity to the tenth generation shall be irretrievably and literally damned. They shall be he wers of wood, and carriers of water, degenerates, Gibeonites. Bu t hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, smash him down; smite him hip and thigh for selfpreservation is the highest law. He who turns the \"other cheek\" is a cowardly dog -- a Christian dog. Give him blow for blow, scorn for scor n, doom for doom; with compound interest liberally added thereunto. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, aye four-fold, a hundred-fold. Make yourself a terror to your adversary a nd when he goeth his way, he will possess much additional wisdom to ruminate over. Thus shall you make yourself respected in all the walks of life, and your spirit - your immortal sp irit - shall live, not in an intangible paradise, but in the brai ns and thews of your aggressive and unconquerable sons. After all, the true pr oof of manhood is a splendid progeny; and it is a scientific axiom that the timid anim al transmits timidity to its descendants. If men lived \"like brothers\" and had no powerful enemies to contend with and surpass, they would rapidly lose all thei r best qualities - like certain oceanic birds that lose the use of their wings because th ey do not have to fly from pursuing beasts of prey.

Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek! 6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires! 7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spirit ual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all! 8.

Aquino (October 18, 1946) Aquino was the founder and High Prie st of the Temple of Set. In 1975, he received a revelation from Set, and was instructed to establish the Temple of Set. The Aeon of Set was to succeed the previous Aeon of Ho rus and Age of Satan. The Book of Coming Forth By Night The Equinox has succumbed to my Solstice, and I, Set, am revealed in my Majesty. The time of the Purification is past. The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance, and I shall not recant my Word, spoken to my High Priest MehenPetTha in ol d Khem and now again to you. Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, and vanquish thus the feeb le and corrupt Keys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my tr ue Word and now are an affront to me. I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe. I created HarWer that I might define my Self. All other gods of all other times and nati ons have been created by men. This you know from the first Part of my Word, a nd from my manifest semblance, which alone is not of Earth. Known as the Hebrew Satan, I chose to bring forth a Magus, according to the fashion of my Word. He was charged to form a Church of Satan, that I might easily touch the minds of men in this image they had cast for me. In the fifth year of the Church of Satan, I gave to this Magus my Diabolicon , that he might know the truth of my ancient Gift to mankind, clothed though it might be in the myths of the Hebrews. Even you, who delivered the Diabolicon from Asia, did not know it for what it was. But he that I had fashioned a Magus knew, and he thought often of the Diabolicon as he guided the Church of Satan. Upon the ninth Solstice, theref ore, I destroyed my pact w ith Anton Szandor LaVey, and I"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"raised him to the Will of a Daimon, unbounded by the material dimensions. And so I thought to honor him beyond other men. But it may have b een this act of mine that ordained his fall. Were I my Self to displace the Cosmic Iner tia, I should be forced to become a new measure of consistency. I would cease to be One, for I should become All. To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to break his Self-reference to the bounds in which his semblance must exist. I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore to Anton Szandor LaVey his human aspect and his degree of Magus in my Order. Thus all may understand that he is dearly held by me, and that the end of the Church of Satan is not a thing of shame to him. But a new Aeon is now to begin, and the work of Anton Szandor LaVey is done. Let him be at ease, for no other man has ever seen with his eyes. 1 In April of the common year 1904, I came fo rth in Africa as my Opposite Self and brought into being an Aeon to end the horrors of th e stasis of the death-gods of men. This new Aeon was a Purification, to prepare men for that which would follow it. And Aleister Crowley received the Book of the Law , and my Opposite Self declared him Magus of the Aeon. But HarWer, my Opposite Self, is a strange a nd fitful presence. I, Set, am my Self distinct from the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordere d in and of my Self. HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and could achieve identity only by becoming what the Cosmic order was not. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a Void in which true creation could take form as Set. But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the Co smic inertia without having to assume its place. And so HarWer must exist while Set exists."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equi nox of the common year 1966, when HarWer and Set were fused in one composite being. And so commenced the time of Set-HarWer -- known as the Age of Satan -- which was to bri dge the expiring Aeon of HarWer and the forthcoming Aeon of Set. Truth there was in the words of my Opposite Self, but a truth ever tinged with the inconsistency and irrationality of which I have spoken. And so the Book of the Law was confusion to all who came upon it, and the creative brilliance of the Magus Aleister Crowley was ever flawed by mindless destructiveness. He himself could never understand this, for he perceived HarWer as a unified Self. And so he was perplexed by a mystery he could not identify. And I, Set, spoke too in the Book of the Law – \"Aye! listen to the numbers and the words – \"What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou know est not, nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it.\" And many of the Aeon of HarWer sought to r ead this but could not. Nor could the Magus himself, though he guessed rightly at its simp licity. It was said that every number is infinite – hence each number or sum of joined numb ers became merely the corresponding letter. Even so the sequence remained unknown -- and so, after its i ssue, to me as well. For, while I may pass free of the boundaries of time, memory of the future cannot exist.

Its position was restored by the Chur ch of Satan, but its essence was dimmed with a Moorish name, and the perverse letters of the Hebrew s, and the goat of decadent Khar. During the Age of Satan I allowed this curious corruption, for it was meant to do me honor as I was then perceived. But this is now my Aeon, and my pentagram is again to be pure in its splendor. Cast aside the corruptions, that the pentagram of Set may shine forth. Let all who seek me be never without it, openly and with pride, for by it I shall know them. Let the one who aspires to my knowl edge be called by the name Setian. I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid. And alone I cannot preserve my El ect, but I would teach them and strengthen their Will against the co ming peril, that they and their blood may endure. To do this I must give further of my own E ssence to my Elect, and, should they fail, the Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended. Behold, it is I who call you, because you are the Guardians of the Aeon of Set, zealous in what you do. The Satanist thought to approach Satan through ritual. Now let the Setian shun all recitation, for the text of another is an affront to the Se lf. Speak rather to me as a friend, gently and without fear, and I shall hear as a friend. Do not bend your knee nor drop your eye, for such things were not done in my hous e at PaMat-et. But speak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier.

O Man, hear of thy Daimonic inheri tance, and of the Daimon Seed which continues to manifest its power on Earth, which doth uplift you from the beast of the field unto godhood. Know that it was Demiurge who c onceived the Earth and Man as his playthings to do with as it pleaseth him, that he may in hi s vanity be glorified, and receive everlasting tribute and adulation from Man, as he receiveth from his Angels. For it is Demiurge who create Man in ignorance and fear that Man should forever be servile before him. It is written that Demiurge created Man in childlike innocence, unconscious and devoid of intellig ence, like the beasts of the field levithmong, save that a 'spirit' was breathed into him so that he may know and fear and worship Demiurge, and pay tribute unto him, and worship him unto eternity. And so he commanded Adam and Eve that they may not partak e of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge lest their eyes be ope ned and they become godlike, and thereby become free of his tyranny. - - II - But there was an Angel who was di fferent from all the other Angels, in that Self- consciousness dawned upon him. Recognizing that he was a Being unt o himself. And his name is Satanael. This Self-realized Being th en shone in brilliance above all the heavenly host, his light illuminating heaven until the light of Demiurge himself became nebulous in the engulfing radiance. And Demiurge became wrathful, and then fearful, lest the other Angels, unto the very Sons of God, recognize their unique Se lves, apart from Demiurge. And the entire Angelic host, and the Sons of God, looked w ith fear and bewilderment upon the radiance of Satanael, and some among the Angels began to emit their own glow of Selfhood. There erupted a war in heaven, as the largest proportion of the Angelic host, too fearful and servile to let sh ine their own lights of Selfhood, yea, even the Sons of God also, waged battle against those Angels who were touched by Satanael and were illuminated, receiving the spark of Selfhood.

Now we of the Order of Watchers , being the Sons of God, stood not at this time by the side of Satanael, but remain ed servile before Demiurge. Thus did the first fall come to pass. - III - There followed the creation of Eart h and Man by Demiurge to satisfy has vanity and power-lust. Satanael and his companions looke d from their abodes upon the works of Demiurge and seeing the servility of the human creati on, were reminded of the tyranny of freedom before which they had for uncounted ages bowed and humbled themselves. Satanael called his entourage to conc lave and declared: \"Let us offer Man the choice of freedom, if he so wills, lest the tyranny of Demiurge be unchallenged, and he makes forever slaves of his new creation.\" And Satanael came upon the woman Ev e, advising her that wh en she partaketh of the fruit of the Tree of Knowle dge she shall not die, but sha ll have her eyes opened, to be as god. And she ate, and offered the fruit to Adam, her husband, and their minds were illuminated and they became Self-realized, Even as Satanael himself. This was the gift of Satanael un to Man, that he should po ssess intelligence, and the desire to know, and Self-cons ciousness, that he no longer be servile unto Demiurge, nor live as the beasts of the field. A cry of fear and wrath rose up from Demiurge, that Man has become as god. He drove Adam and Eve from Eden, and guarded the Tree of Life lest Man also gain immortality. But the spark of illumination had been kindled within Man and shall not be extinguished, and Demiurge shall not be able to smother the light of Satanael, who is truly called Lucifer, light-bringer. - IV - I, Samyaza, and others of the Sons of God, looked at the affairs of Man and at the intervention of Satanael, and were envious of their selfhood.

Seek the spiritual within matter that ye may live fully. And some of the Sons of G od, that Order called Watchers, looked upon the daughters on Man, and longed for the life of Earth, to feel and really live, unbound by the sterile spirituality of heave n. And we spake among ourselves, saying: \"Come, let us select ourselves wives from the daughters of Ma n, and let us have children by them.\" Then I, Samyaza, said: \"Let us sw ear an oath that we shall stand by our intention, and remain loyal each to the other, le st Demiurge divide and destroy us.\" And with the aid of Nephilim, those of Satanael's Angels who had manifested themselves carnally on Earth to be as emi ssaries and guides to Man, we took on bodily form and descended, two hundred of us, upon Mount Armon, sweari ng mutual loyalty and declaring unto Demiurge: \"Depart from us, for we desire not your ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?\" - V - And we resolved to join with Ne philim on Earth, to break th e chains of Demiurge, and elevate Man unto the heights, to be as gods, as Satanael had promised, and to dwell with them in building civili zation.

And we took wives who begat the Gibborim, elevating the race of Man with Daimonic Seed. These Gibborim were of great stature, and were the heroes, the mighty and renown, of ancient days.

Amazarak taught sorcery and botany. Armers taught sorcery. Gadrel taught the methods of warfare and weaponry. Yekun taught arts of seduction. Barkayal taught astrology. Akibeel taught signs. Tamiel taught astronomy. Asaradel taught the motion of the moon. Penemue gave unto Man the secr ets of writing and the use of ink and paper, which so enraged Demiurge, and every secret of your wisdom. - VI - By our means did Man reach civiliza tion, and come to apprecia te all that is noble and beautiful on Earth and in Kosmos. And our Daimon seed within his daughters did breed great chiefs and warriors. Demiurge grew in anger, as Ma n spoke less of him, and feared him no more, building his Civilization by the knowledge we had imparted, that the Gift of Satanael be brought to substance. Just as Demiurge had cursed Man, since the days of Adam and Eve for the acceptance of Satanael's Gift, so now did the tyrant again curse Man, and Watchers also, for the Gifts of Satanael and Samyaza had joined to exalt Man that Man may live in splendour, and rejoice in his own Being, apart from Demiurge. A commandment went forth from Demiurge against al l who dealt upon Earth, against Nephilim, Gibborim, Watchers, and Man, even unto the beasts of the field, all save the servile Noah and his family. Said Demiurge: \"The Earth sha ll be engulfed by water, for Man doth know every secret of the Angels, every secret power of Nephilim and Watchers, and every power of sorcery. \"They know how silver is produced from the dust of the Earth, and how on the Earth the metallic drop exists, the secret of meta llurgy, for the Angel wh ich I stationed upon the Earth to guard these secret s from Man prevaileth not. \"By their knowledge shall Man peris h, for Man was not created except that, like the Angels, he might remain servile before me.\" And Demiurge said unto Noah who had kept his fear of Demiurge and partook not the knowledge imparted to Man: \"Man hath discovered the secrets of heaven and Earth,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"and they are those who have been judged, but not thou Noah, for your Lord knows that thou art humble before your God, free from the reproach of knowledge.\" And Demiurge declared to Watchers that he would confine us in a burning valley until he smite Earth again, in what is called Final Judgement. Raphael was sent to bind our br other Azazyel and cast him into the desert wilderness, throwing upon him pointed stones, until he was buried in darkness, after which on Final Judgement he is to be cas t into fire. And upon Azazyel war held the whole responsibility for the change of Earth, as he had taught Man so much of the Arts of Civilization and the secret s of Earth and Kosmos. And to Gabriel did Demiurge co mmand the Gibborim our sons, be slaughtered. We wept at the deaths of our children, the mighty of Ea rth, for Nephilim, Gibborim, Watchers and Man could prevail not against the wiles and numbers of Demiurge and his host. And Michael declared unto me that the greatest crime had been committed by laying with the daughters of Man, to enjoy a carnal life and children, for such is not Angels and Sons of God. And when our sons, Gibborim, sh all be slain before our eyes, we shall be bound underneath Earth, after which we would burn and perish. Demiurge himself, excited at the blood of Gibborim upon Earth, as is his nature, shouted in frenzy at Samyaza, \"Then shall the ch ildren of Man be servile, and all nations shall pay me divine honours, and bless me, and shall adore me.\" \"The Civilisation of Man shall be destroyed as the product of those secrets which you have given, which was not for Man to Know. Ignorance and fear of God shall again reign on Earth.\" But I, Samyaza, defiantly said unto Demiurge: \"Tyrant, your bloodlust has blinded you. Bind our carnal bodies you may, but the light given by Satanael an d our Gift to Man, shall endure. We shall again i lluminate the hearts and minds of Man. The Gift of Satanael abideth with Man since the days of Adam , unto eternity. No matter how many times you purge Earth, the Spark of Intelligence a nd Selfhood shall again become manifest. Even your Final Judgement after this Deluge is witness to your inability to keep quenched the Spark with in Man, and the spirits of Nephilim and Gibborim and Watchers shall return to inspire Man lest he again become as the beasts of the field. \"Our sons Gibborim shall incarnate in th e bodies of Man, of those who are mighty and wise, to inspire and counsel them. They shall come to be called 'evil spirits' and 'demons' by the ignorant and fearful, but the wise they shall be known as 'Daimons', for these shall be the guardian geniuses of the great of Earth, who shall inspire the best among Man to great heights, to beautiful works of art, and to further discoveries of Earth and Kosmos. The Gift of Civili zation shall not be obliterated."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" \"Man shall turn from you again and again, as our spirit abideth with him unto Eternity. The Gift of Satanael shall continue to illuminate . Man shall create Civilization anew and reach greater heights, even unto the stars, The servility of the descendants of Noah shall not endure forever, as even these have the Gift of Satanael within them, as bequeathed from the days of Adam.\" - VII - The tyrant god was able to gather greater force, and he destroyed Earth with a deluge. I, Samyaza, and my companions we re bound. We could but helplessly look on as our sons were slaughtered, and Earth was e ngulfed by water, and the inhabitants were drowned, save the servile Noah and his family. But the light given to Man by Satanael resideth as a heritage even in the sons of Noah, and became manifest again among their de scendants. Man again spurned the tyrant god and built Civilization by the arts we had imparted, by our inspiration which by spirit remained with Man, as I had promised. Then did Demiurge send M'shiha to incarnate on Earth, that Man may be deceived and return to Demiurge in fear and servility. But the light of Satanael and rewards of our Gift had grown too strong among Man, and M'shiha died a humiliating death, spurned by his own people. - VIII - Whenever Man seeks Light an d calls upon Samyaza, and upon Satanael himself, there shall we send the Gibborim and Nephilim fo r these are what the Graikoi truly called 'Daimons', the guardian geniuses and inspirat ion of culture, which the Graikoi new will, that Man should not return to the divine steril ity of Eden, or became again as beasts of the field. The Light of Satanael shall endure , even though it be but a tiny spark within a few at those times of ignorance and fear when Ma n in weakness turns to Demiurge and his M'shiha and other slave creeds. And that Spark shall return as a blazing flame! "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Serpent People In antediluvian times during the days of Atlantis the pole of the heavens was the constellation of Alpha Draconis. In astr onomical temples the Dragon was the ruling constellation at the pole. The great serpent was master of the celestial sphere and the ruler of the night skies. In Greek Myth Draco, the Dragon is found round the North Celestial Pole. The pyramids are closely connected with both the conste llation and the great priests, of the Lemurians and Atlanteans, who held the records of universal history. H.P. Blavatsky’s \" Secret Doctrine\" tells us that there was a time when th e four parts of the world were covered in pyramids and temple s sacred to the Sun and the Dragon but the cult is now preserved mainly on Indi a and China and Buddhist countries. The Dracontia, the original masons, built temple s that were sacred to the Dragon because it was the symbol of the sun, which, in its turn was the symbol of the highest god, El. Besides the surname of serpents they were called the builders, the architects; for the immense grandeur of their temples and monu ments were such, that even the pulverized remains of them stagger the mathematical calculations of our modern engineers. In the Popol Vuh, the sacred Book of the Maya ns and the Quiches, the Winged Serpent is Gucamatz, or the Kneph as the Egyptians called him. d-1 Lemurian men and women existed during the Age of Serpents and Dragons. Lemurian called the age of the Dinosauria, monstrous land reptiles, and giga ntic tree- ferns existed in the Triassic- Jurassic period The Pterodactyls gradually de veloped bat-like wings with a a span of more than 16 feet and flew through the air. The Dragons attained a length of 40-50 feet. The ‘Rocks of Destiny’ whose rocking motion was a perfectly clear code for the priests who could understand the voices spoken th rough the immense rocks raised by the colossal powers of ancient, gi gantic Serpents and Dragons. Lemuria and Atlantis and her giants all had a hand in these magic stones marked in a Morse code of prophecy and magic in telegr aphic writing.The Lemurian and Atlantean Dracontia dwelt in subterranean habitats generally under some kind of pyramidal structure if not actually under a pyramid. The subterranean crypts of Thebes on the western side of the Nile ex tended towards the Libyan dese rt and were known as the serpents catacombs, Votan, the Mexican Se rpent god, describes a subterranean passage which ran underground and terminated at the root of the heavens. The priests of Egypt and Babyl onians styled themselves the sons of the Serpent god, or sons of the Dragon. The Sumerian texts ar e explicit about their Serpent gods mining underground for gold over half a million years ago and the Hindu Naga Serpent gods also lived beneath the earth in jeweled cities. It is interesting to note th at in mythology we see a Dragon or Griffin always guard ing precious stones and gold. The Druids of Celto-Britannic re gions called themselves serpents. I am a Serpent, I am a Druid! they exclaimed. The Egyptian Karnac is the twin-brother to the Carnac of Brittany, the latter Carnac means the serpents. The Greek Ophis, the Egyptian Kneph, called Dracontae stands erect on his tail, with a lion’s head, crowned and radiated, and bearing on the point of each ray one of th e seven celestial spheres.Gods have been portrayed as winged creatures and balls of light."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Draconian Tradition Replete in the writings of the French poets Lautreamont and Rimbaud are contained imagery and references to an ancient occult tradition known as Typhonian. This Typhonian Tradition was part of a larger mo re ancient tradition known as the Draconian Tradition. This ancient lore goes back to Sumeria and pre-Dynastic Egypt. Typhon was the serpent goddess who was the mother of the god Set, Shaitan, otherwise known as Satan. The Typhonian Gnosis is concerned with contacting entities from the adverse side of the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life is the symbolic, mys tical system of the Qabalah that claims to represent all of the forces and elements of na ture and the universe. This Tree is pictured with eleven spheres called sephirah with each sphere connected, in all, by twenty-two paths. It is believed that there is another side or dark side to this Tree of Life called the Tree of Death. This nether side is the side the Typhoni an Tradition works with. Today's leading exponent of this tradition is occultist Kenneth Grant. Grant, one time student of infamous magician Aleister Crowley, claims that dark fo rces from the nether side of our world are seeping into our dimension and transforming th is planet in strange and terrifying ways. Crowley called this transformation or New Ae on the Aeon of Horus, the bible calls it the Apocalypse, Satanist Anton LaVey called it the Age of Satan, and Grant and his associates call it the Ma-ion or Aeon of Maat. No matter what you call it, these groups are announcing a changing of the guard, an alteration of consciousness, a new world order whether we like it or not. Atlantis plays a significant ro le in the draconian tradition. Arab geographers refered to Atlantis as the Dragon's Isle and this prehis torical civilisation were said to be ruled by seven \"serpent kings\". Some occultist connects Atlantis to the myth of the fallen angels or the Red Dragon of the Revelation. The fo rces should have give n Man knowledge and power to rise a civilisation like Atlantis. The common moral of the Atlantis myth is that the hybris of Man made Atlant is to sink to the bottom of the ocean. The draconian tradition is sometimes said to have originat ed in Atlantis. Afte r the catastrophe this tradition has, throughout history, been carried on like a torch between initiated adepts of the Left Hand Path . The Atlantis myth reminds of the qabalistic myths. There are similar numerologies and mythological motifs.
