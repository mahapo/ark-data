I have made every attempt to provide readers with all of the basic documents from the Church of Satan for those curious about Satanism and for those who might be interested in joining our organization. We begin with the essay, \"Satanism: The Feared Religion\" from our current High Priest, Peter H. Gilmore. I believe this to be the definitive introductory essay that encapsulates much of who and what we are, and the perfect segue into the remainder of this document's material. This document is free of charge and can be freely distributed, provided it is not altered in any way, shape or form. I will most likely release updated versions as circumstances permit and post such to the Not Like Most website, where you will also find an abridged version of this document in standard text file format, as well as additional essays and articles from the \"publication of Satanism in action.\" Enjoy.

Gilmore When Anton Szandor LaVey shaved his head and created the Church of Satan on April 30, 1966, he knew that soon he would be the focal point of attention for people throughout the globe. Now that the thirtieth anniversary of that fateful night has passed, has the world begun to understand the real meaning behind the only organized religion in history to take as its symbol the ultimate figure of pride and rebellion, and to many, of Evil? And are there truly some grounds for people to feel fear at the ever growing phenomenon of contemporary Satanism? As a priest in the Church of Satan and media representative, I can candidly say, Yes! However, what the general populace has decided to fear is a ludicrous portrait that has been painted in lurid technicolor by media hypesters intent on titillation, evangelists struggling to fill their coffers and keep their mistresses in jewelry, and most distressingly, by a segment of the therapeutic community who have found a gold- mine in the treatment of so-called ritual abuse survivors who provide no evidence of their tales of terror (remarkably similar to stories told by women labelled by Freud as hysterics), save for their fervent belief that they were victimized. I shall not waste time in refuting the absurd claim that there is an international conspiracy of generational Satanists bent on enslaving the world through drug use and sacrifice of babies bred for that purpose by emotionally unstable women. That mythology has been thoroughly exploded by other sources (The FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime: Investigator's Guide to Allegations of Ritual Child Abuse , January 1992; the Committee for Scientific Examination of Religion's report Satanism in America , October 1989; the British Government's Department of Health report: The Extent and Nature of Organised and Ritual Abuse , HMSO, 1994 ). Let us instead look at contemporary Satanism for what it really is: a brutal religion of elitism and social Darwinism that seeks to re-establish the reign of the able over the idiotic, of swift justice over injustice, and for a wholesale rejection of egalitarianism as a myth that has crippled the advancement of the human species for the last two thousand years. Is that something to fear? If you're one of the majority of human mediocrities merely existing as a media-besotted drone, you bet it is! The philosophy of Satanism is delineated in the writings of Anton Szandor LaVey. His books include The Satanic Bible , The Satanic Rituals , The Satanic Witch (originally published as The Compleat Witch ), The Devil's Notebook and Satan Speaks . All are file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/FearedReligion.html (1 of 7) [8/18/2004 7:19:03 PM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FearedReligion currently in print and should be consulted by anyone interested in a complete picture of the views held by the Church of Satan. One can obtain further information by reading two books by Blanche Barton (consort to Mr. LaVey, mother of his son Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey, and the High Priestess of the Church), The Secret Life of a Satanist, the authorized biography of Anton LaVey (Feral House) and The Church of Satan (Hell's Kitchen Productions). These works have a great deal of material regarding the history and contemporary practices of the Church of Satan. For those who have yet to study this literature, there are three sets of brief guidelines issued over the years by the Church and authored by LaVey, which can give the uninitiated a capsulized version of Satanic philosophy. The first are the Nine Satanic Statements which open The Satanic Bible and give a firm foundation for the Satanist. The next statements, The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth, were written at about the same time, but were then considered too frank and brutal for general release and issued only to the membership. Here is decreed the Lex Satanicus, a law of the jungle for social interaction. Since we have been issuing statements of what we are seeking, it was considered time to make a list of behaviors that we wish to see avoided in the Satanic community. Satanists acknowledge that we are human and work towards perfection, but can sometimes fall into negative patterns of action. Thus was born the list of The Nine Satanic Sins, guidelines for what Satanists consider to be non-productive behavior to be recognized and eliminated from one's daily existence. This basically sums up the rudiments of Satanic philosophy. It certainly has nothing to do with the prevailing Judeo-Christian outlook of altruism and self-sacrifice, and can thus seem quite alien and frightening to one brought up in that world view. Realistically, the Satanic code of behavior is based on human nature as it is and thus comes naturally to most people who have not been deeply indoctrinated in anti-life and anti-rational belief systems. It is a fact that many people today call themselves Christians but really have no clear concept as to what that philosophy fully entails, so they generally behave in a Satanic fashion. We think that it is high time that this is recognized and that people call themselves what they truly are, not what is socially convenient for them. As you can see, there are no elements of Devil worship in the Church of Satan. Such practices are looked upon as being Christian heresies; believing in the dualistic Christian world view of \"God vs. the Devil\" and choosing to side with the Prince of Darkness. Satanists do not believe in the supernatural, in neither God nor the Devil. To the Satanist, he is his own God. Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. The reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/FearedReligion.html (2 of 7) [8/18/2004 7:19:03 PM]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FearedReligion Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshipped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will. Thus any concept of sacrifice is rejected as a Christian aberration in Satanism there's no deity to which one can sacrifice. Satanists do have experience of the super-normal in their practice of ritual or Greater Magic . This is a technique for influencing the outcome of human events to desired ends via reaching an extreme emotional state in the context of a ritual, sending forth a vision of what you want to occur (the Is To Be ), which, if your levels of adrenaline are high enough, will permeate the unconscious minds of those you wish to influence, causing them to behave as you Will when the time is right. This does not mean that anything is possible, for it takes a great deal of energy to make a strong sending, and it is often difficult to influence events from the inertia of their present directions. Awareness of your abilities and what is possible to achieve is the hallmark of a successful Satanic magician. The theory and practice for Greater Magic is to be found in The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals . Satanists also practice Lesser Magic which is basically the day to day manipulation of your fellows to obtain your ends. Detailed techniques are given in The Satanic Witch . Recently we have seen certain evangelists and even academics calling Satanism a neo-Nazi movement. This is an innacurate label. The Nazi movement drew much of its power from a racist doctrine of Aryan superiority. Satanism is far more discerning than that. While there are provable biological differences between the races and statistically demonstrable performance levels in various activities, it is quite irrational to think that someone can be elite or not simply because of the color of their skin. Even if one comes from promising genetic stock, and by that we mean from ancestors who have proven their abilities to be superior in performance, this does not guarantee an individual's advancement. No, we Satanists only recognize an individual as elite if they prove it by cultivating their natually endowed abilities to the highest extent possible. This is something that requires the Satanic virtue of discipline, a quality we try to instill in our own iron youth. There are elite individuals from all ethnic backgrounds, and they are embraced by Satanism for the superior beings that they are creating a uniquely Satanic ethnic. Satanists treasure individualism, hardly something to be gained goose-stepping down the strasse . Yet we do not embrace an \"anything goes\" atmosphere wherein all values are relative and nothing rises above a sludge of commonality. Satanism encourages a return to more traditional values in art and literature such as mastery of technique and emotional communication, of form and function, design and execution. Satanists find a wealth of material in Western culture to be treasured for the pinnacle of human achievements that they are, and not to be buried under the swill of multiculturalist attempts to displace them with dubious achievements simply because they are non-Western as has become rampant in some academic circles of late. We call to each individual to seek human greatness wherever it can be found, from the vaults of history and from the talented producers of the present, and to deride the trendy sham for the shallow fa√ßade that it is. Since Satanism file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/FearedReligion.html (3 of 7) [8/18/2004 7:19:03 PM]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FearedReligion stands for acceptance of Man as an animal, there have often been creators in many past cultures who embraced this insight and explored it in the context of their society, thus we seek out these artisitic and philosophical expressions and see them to be the roots of our current awareness. Satanists see the social structure of humanity as being stratified , thus each person reaches a level commensurate with the development (or lack thereof) of their natural talents. The principle of the survival of the strong is advocated on all levels of society, from allowing an individual to stand or fall, to even letting those nations that cannot handle themselves take the consequences of this inability. Any assistance on all levels will be on a \"quid pro quo\" basis. There would be a concommitant reduction in the world's population as the weak are allowed to experience the consequences of social Darwinism. Thus has nature always acted to cleanse and strengthen her children. This is harsh, but that is the way of the world. We embrace reality and do not try to transform it into some utopia that is contrary to the very fabric of existence. Practical application of this doctrine would see the complete cessation of the welfare system, an end to no-strings attached foreign aid and new programs to award and encourage gifted individuals in all fields to pursue personal excellence. A meritocracy will replace the practice of such injustices as affirmative action and other programs designed to punish the able and reward the undeserving. Satanists also seek to enhance the laws of nature by concentrating on fostering the practice of eugenics . This is not some exotic doctrine hatched in the brains of Third Reich medical madmen. It is the practice of encouraging people of talent and ability to reproduce, to enrich the gene pool from which our species can grow. This was commonly practiced throughout the world, as even a text on eugenics endorsed by the Women's Christian Temperence Union can prove, until it was given a bad name by Nazi excesses. Until the genetic code is cracked and we can choose the character of our offspring at will, Satanists seek to mate the best with the best. Satanists who know that they are defective refrain from reproducing. Satanists are particulary disgusted by the extraordinary level of criminal activity which abounds today and thus advocate a return to the Roman Lex Talionis ; let the punishment fit in kind and degree the crime. To achieve this, we would be pleased to see the institution of an elite police force, of men and women in peak physical and mental condition, trained in advanced techniques of crime fighting who would be truly equipped to handle the vermin that make so many of our cities into little more than concrete jungles. Man is by nature a social creature and makes his social contract with his fellows, thus rules of conduct are established to allow maximum freedom for individuals to interact. Disobey those rules and punishment must be swift and sure, and most probably public as well. This does not mean the incarceration of individuals in institutions at the expense of the victims for so called rehabilitation. No, these criminals must be put to some use, perhaps as forced labor to even clean up the environment that has so carelessly been soiled under the dominance of Christian spiritual philosophy that sees man as superior to other living file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/FearedReligion.html (4 of 7) [8/18/2004 7:19:03 PM]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FearedReligion creatures with a God-given right to abuse them at will. Man is an animal, and must go back to acting like one not soiling his own lair as only twisted humans do. The Church of Satan pursues a five point plan to move society in directions that are considered to be beneficial to Satanists. The first point is the advocation of general recognition and acceptance of stratification , which is no less than the elimination of egalitarianism wherever it has taken root. Mediocrity shall be identified and despised. The stupid should suffer for their behavior. The truly beautiful and magnificent are to be cherished. Each individual must choose for himself his own aesthetic standards, but we think that there are certain elements of achievement that are undeniable, even if they are not satisfying to everyone. For example, one cannot deny the superior accomplishment inherent in a Beethoven symphony, a Michelangelo sculpture, a daVinci painting, or a Shakespeare play. Many Satanists are working to create their own citadels of excellence outside of the cultural mainstream and have preserved the worthy from the past and continue to create new works of power to be unleashed to those who will be appreciative. The second point is the enforcement of strict taxation of all churches . This would remove the government sanction of religion and force these parasites to live off of their own members alone, and if they can't, then they will perish as they should. The Church of Satan has never pursued tax-exempt status and challenges all the rest of the world's churches to stand on their own feet. Let us expose the vampiric nature of the organized religions and see if they can withstand the light of day. Third, we call for the re-establishment of Lex Talionis throughout human society. The Judeo-Christian tradition which exists secularly under the guise of liberal humanism has exalted the criminal over the victim, taking responsibility away from the wrong-doer with their doctrine of forgiveness. Such thinking is a disgrace towards the ideal of justice. This must stop! Individuals must be held accountable for the consequences of their actions, and not be allowed to scapegoat society, history, or other supposed \"outside\" influences. It should come as no surprise that many Satanists are part of law enforcement agencies, and a large number of people throughout this and other criminal justice systems who fully agree with Satanic philosophy on this point. If the law is not being enforced, Satanists advocate the practice of seeking personal justice, but you are warned to be fully aware of the consequences of such actions in today's corrupt society. With the present state of affairs, the outcry may yet come to welcome justice back to stay. Fourth, Satanists advocate a new industry, the development and promotion of artificial human companions . These humanoids will be constructed to be as realistic as possible, and available to anyone who can afford one. Recognizing that the human animal often raises himself up throught the denegration of another, this would provide a safe outlet for such behavior. Have the lover of your dreams, regardless of your own prowess; every man a king who can purchase his own subject; or contrarywise, buy the master you wish to serve.

What could be better for blowing-off the tension that exists throughout our society, and promoting healthier interaction among true humans? Finally we advocate the construction of total environments , technologically up-to-date but theatrically convincing, to be literal pleasure domes and places of amusement and delight. We have seen the beginnings in some of the major theme parks, but let us take them on to the heights depicted in films like Westworld . Here you will be able to indulge in whatever environment you can imagine. Re-creation of past history would not only be ripe for these constructions, but science fiction and fantasy will provide fertile sources for many of these playgounds. Even now such projects are gearing up. Would the average person be able to spot a member of the Church of Satan? Since Satanists cover the total spectrum of economic and professional achievement, unless someone is sporting a sigil of Baphomet medallion, or wearing the Baphomet lapel pin signifying an official representative, you really can not pin down a Satanist by appearance and behavior alone. In their daily practices, Satanists are individuals who are enjoying their lives in the here and now. They eat what they please, dress as they please, and generally follow whatever life style suits them best, so long as it is within the laws of their country of residence. There is no requirement for participation in ritual activity. The techniques presented in our literature are for members to make use of as they so desire. Some Satanists enjoy the social atmosphere of group ritual and seek out others for this purpose. Many Satanists find their ritual activity to be very personal and prefer to remain solitary. Either path is acceptible to the Church of Satan. Indeed, there are no rules for frequency of ritual activity. Some celebrate the equinoxes and solstices as holidays, but of course one's own birthday is the highest Satanic holiday of the year. The ritual process is often used as a cathartic, to cleanse the individual of desires that could turn into compulsions if they remained unfulfilled, thus such practices take the place of therapy. Satanists cherish their individuality and do not try to conform to others' standards of normality. Also, Satanists do not proselytize so you will not find yourself approached by someone in a black cloak waving tracts in your face. We have our literature readily available, and should someone find the philosophy to be to their liking, they may approach us to investigate the possibility of affiliation. The general public would probably be surprised to find that they have been interacting with Satanists for many years, and that these Satanists will be some of the most interesting, fair, trustworthy, and enjoyable people that they know. The world, when fully permeated by Satanism, will provide a challenging environment wherein you can achieve much, or little, based on the level of input you can muster and the extent of your natural abilities. Yes, this is frightening to the masses who wish to sit back and be herded from one media-hyped product to the next. Our world challenges you to think, and do something with those thoughts!

They can continue their self-destructive paths if so desired, but they shall not be allowed to hold back those who want to achieve greatness.

Satanism is a life-loving, rational philosophy that millions of people adhere to. Now we're ready for something that goes quite a few steps beyond just explaining our principles. Every revisionist movement needs a set of goals/guidelines that are clear, concrete, and that will effect significant changes. The following Five-Point Program reflects attitudes which allow others to decide whether they wish to align themselves with Satanism or not. Each is necessary for Satanic change to take place. When asked what we're \"doing,\" here's the answer: 1. Stratification: The point on which all the others ultimately rest. There can be no more myth of \"equality\" for all -- it only translates to \"mediocrity\" and supports the weak at the expense of the strong. Water must be allowed to seek its own level without interference from apologists for incompetence. No one should be protected from the effects of his own stupidity. 2. Strict taxation of all churches: If churches were taxed for all their income and property, they'd crumble overnight of their own obsolescence, and the National Debt would be wiped out as quickly. The productive, the creative, the resourceful should be subsidized. So long as the useless and incompetent are getting paid, they should be heavily taxed. 3. No tolerance for religious beliefs secularized and incorporated into law and order issues: to re-establish Lex Talionis would require a complete overturning of the present in - justice system based on Judeo-Christian ideals, where the victim/defender has been made the criminal. Amnesty should be considered for anyone in prison because of his alleged \"influence\" upon the actual perpetrator of the crime. Everyone is influenced in what he or she does.

Development and production of artificial human companions: The forbidden industry. An economic \"godsend\" which will allow everyone power over someone else.

If you're new to the Realm of Darkness, suddenly feeling the fires of Satan burning within you, be warned: there are unethical individuals out there who will prey upon you, claim to teach you how to become a Great Black Magician overnight, who will promise instructional fellowship and activities with \"True Masters,\" who may claim unverifiable links with the Church of Satan or other such lineage. With the continued expansion of the Internet, this situation has multiplied geometrically, so your vigilance will continue to be tested as you walk along this cyber-midway. We expect that you will develop the cold-reading abilities of a Carney, rather than the na√Øvet√© of the mark. To that end, dear apprentice, we're showing you some of the ropes. Here's a tip sheet to recognize pseudo- and anti-Satanic groups that have sprouted up since LaVey started the original Church of Satan: 1. When someone claims to have a direct line of communication with Satan, watch out. Selling that kind of mysticism is exactly how Christianity has kept people enslaved in ignorance for centuries. It's one of the things we're fighting against. 2. Look out for jargon and secrets to which only the \"initiated\" can be privy. Once you're processed through the lengthy and strictly-enforced \"degree system,\" you'll discover there are really no answers, just more gobbledygook. If they have something worthwhile to say, they'll say it. If they don't, they'll pretend they do anyway. 3. Check the copyright date. Much of the esoterica you may receive from supposed Masters as \"wisdom\" or \"revelation\" comes directly from Anton LaVey, the Church of Satan, or our affiliates. Don't accept the inducements you may receive as emanating from some great brain, when they most likely were cribbed from material released by us weeks, months or years ago. If mainstream writers crib material daily, it can be expected that occultnik hacks would be the first to do likewise. The difference between legit writers doing it and Daimon Oleaginous doing it is that the \"Daimon\" sprinkles his articles with sour-grapes attacks on the Church of Satan while stealing from us. That's Christianity: tearing down the \"other guys,\" who don't have the \"true message.\" It boils down to more parasitism; without us these ersatz Satanists would shrivel up and blow away. 4. The most parasitic \"Satanic\" newsletters invariably contain a liberal dose of LaVey- baiting. Their editors' masochistic requirements are exercised as \"lively exchange.\" Their mainstay is often the reprinting of any letter, pro or con, from anyone capable of grasping a writing implement or poking at a computer or typewriter key. When responding to such transparent tactics, it's our policy to preface rebuttals with two acknowledgments: file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/buncosheet.html (1 of 4) [8/18/2004 7:16:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Bunco Sheet A) \"I know you're a masochist and delight in hostile banter,\" and B) \"Anything I write or say to you will keep you going for another six months.\" The Satanic Bible advises to \"question all things\" -- but it helps to be able to think , first. 5. Most pseudo-Satanic groups are short-lived, running out of money, enthusiasm or suckers before too long. An easier game comes along and they're off in a new direction. 6. How do they deal with Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan? This is tricky -- some current groups play the Christian game of handing out laurels with one hand while stabbing their progenitor in the back with the other. Others aren't so subtle, boldly claiming to be the \"true\" or \"evolved\" Church of Satan. To make their rationale work, they must somehow convince you that the author of The Satanic Bible wasn't practicing pure Satanism, that his Church has gone awry in the hands of his successors, and that their new (or \"authentically historic\") brand is now the straight stuff. Still others just ignore Anton LaVey altogether and hope you won't notice. There are those who appropriate elements of the Church of Satan, as well as those who pretend to be the Church of Satan. Their bids for attention range from clumsily photocopied newsletters to slick websites. Don't be fooled by unauthorized Grottos, phony Orders of the Trapezoid, Silly Intercommunication Networks, First (Second or Third) Churches of Satan, various and sundry Pathetic Priests (almost always of the \"High\" variety -- Anton LaVey once asked, \"Where are all the Low Priests?\"), Mangy Magisters and other bogus diabolists who are cruising for malicious business interference lawsuits while demonstrating their lack of originality. Their game is to get your attention (it is their life's blood), and then to separate you from your money. They know little of Satanism, but to the extent that they successfully fleece the rubes, there is at least a faint glimmer of understanding. 7. Be wary of the approach of \"You probably aren't smart enough to join us.\" The only way you can prove them wrong is by joining! From the first material you get, you feel you have to prove and defend yourself. Don't be fooled by flashy web graphics, big words, nice typing and/or fancy paper...and plenty of it. True Satanism builds the ego, it doesn't tear it down. 8. Beware of cults offering sex orgies and drugs, or killing animals in the name of Satan. As you well know, these are not part of Satanic practices. The leaders are copying the lame- brain spook stories from Geraldo or Oprah and obviously know less than you do. Use common sense. Don't let someone take advantage of you for his or her own perversity; examine motives carefully. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/buncosheet.html (2 of 4) [8/18/2004 7:16:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Bunco Sheet 9. Carefully examine any groups who set themselves up as intermediaries between you and Satanism, who claim that they can instruct you on how to be a Satanist. Anton LaVey wrote The Satanic Bible , as well as his other works, in such a manner so that they can be directly understood -- they are carnal and non-esoteric. No \"teacher\" is needed, no \"guru\" must interpret his words for you. If you are a Satanist, you'll resonate with the concepts in his writings and know that this label is proper for the person you already are -- you're born a Satanist, you don't become one. Legitimate Grottos of the Church of Satan do at times conduct discussion groups, where those who have identified themselves as Satanists may discuss the application of the ideas presented in our basic literature. Those who offer courses to \"teach\" you about Satanism are attempting to fleece the gullible. Buy Anton LaVey's books, view his videos, listen to his music, and explore the works by other Satanic leaders who he has inspired. Use your own wits to grasp them, as Dr. LaVey intended, and laugh at those foolish enough to waste their money on pompous professors. 10. Some other groups to watch out for: A) Feminist, Wiccan-oriented, consciousness-raising groups who practice more male-bashing than magic; B) New Age groups that promote LaVeyan concepts, but shun the dreaded \"S\" word; C) Jargon-laden Christians masquerading as Satanists; D) Pen-pal or lonely hearts social groups pretending to be elitists performing powerful Satanic rituals. All of the above are subject to bitch-fights, petty jealousies, and rivalries. They are safe havens for small-minded people trying to play head games, preferring the protection of groups rather than really working to apply what Anton LaVey wrote. This is not to say that all groups are counterproductive to Satanism as a movement; there are many which are productive, supportive branches of the Church of Satan. Like various divisions of the same army, these distinct Grottos and Orders may emphasize one Satanic image over another, but they are all aligned, in communication and working toward the same goals.

Stupidity: The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardinal Sin of Satanism. It's too bad that stupidity isn't painful. Ignorance is one thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with whatever they are told. The media promotes a cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid. 2. Pretentiousness: Empty posturing can be most irritating and isn't applying the cardinal rules of Lesser Magic. On equal footing with stupidity for what keeps the money in circulation these days. Everyone's made to feel like a big shot, whether they can come up with the goods or not. 3. Solipsism: Can be very dangerous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions, responses and sensibilities onto someone who is probably far less attuned than you are. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same consideration, courtesy and respect that you naturally give them. They won't. Instead, Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of \"Do unto others as they do unto you.\" It's work for most of us and requires constant vigilance lest you slip into a comfortable illusion of everyone being like you. As has been said, certain utopias would be ideal in a nation of philosophers, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, from a Machiavellian standpoint) we are far from that point. 4. Self-deceit: It's in the \"Nine Satanic Statements\" but deserves to be repeated here. Another cardinal sin. We must not pay homage to any of the sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expected to play ourselves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is when it's fun, and with awareness. But then, it's not self-deceit! 5. Herd Conformity: That's obvious from a Satanic stance. It's all right to conform to a person's wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you. The key is to choose a master wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of the many. 6. Lack of Perspective: Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a threat you can be, by your very existence. We are making history right now, every day. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic.

Do not be swayed by herd constraints -- know that you are working on another level entirely from the rest of the world. 7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies: Be aware that this is one of the keys to brainwashing people into accepting something new and different, when in reality it's something that was once widely accepted but is now presented in a new package. We are expected to rave about the genius of the creator and forget the original. This makes for a disposable society. 8. Counterproductive Pride: That first word is important. Pride is great up to the point you begin to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The rule of Satanism is: if it works for you, great. When it stops working for you, when you've painted yourself into a corner and the only way out is to say, I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I wish we could compromise somehow, then do it. 9. Lack of Aesthetics: This is the physical application of the Balance Factor. Aesthetics is important in Lesser Magic and should be cultivated. It is obvious that no one can collect any money off classical standards of beauty and form most of the time so they are discouraged in a consumer society, but an eye for beauty, for balance, is an essential Satanic tool and must be applied for greatest magical effectiveness. It's not what's supposed to be pleasing -- it's what is. Aesthetics is a personal thing, reflective of one's own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious configurations that should not be denied. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/satanicsins.html (2 of 2) [8/18/2004 7:22:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"GrottoOnline Guidelines for Online Grotto Activity Since the Church of Satan reinstated the Grotto System , it has now become the \"Unholy Grail\" for many who wish to set-up a website to either become Grotto Masters, or simply assume the title and all that comes with it.

While browsing the web you might encounter sites that are activities of recognized Church of Satan Grottos, and you will also encounter imposters (do let us know if this occurs). The guidelines below will assist you in recognizing the genuine article from the ersatz. Don't be fooled by \"flash,\" -- accept no substitutes! Our official guidelines are as follows: Websites are Grotto activities , not the reason for establishing a Grotto, and they can include First Level and/or Second Level activities as will be discussed below. Websites can also be personal endeavors, which must clearly represent that the opinions and ideas of the person to whom the page belongs are solely his/her responsibility and do not necessarily, and certainly not officially, reflect the Church of Satan.

If a site has been established by a perspective Grotto Master, it is not an official Grotto activity until they have been granted that privilege. Applicants may design their graphics but not put them before the public until the application has been approved (and we don't approve every application!). It is in the favor of the applicants if they play by these rules -- demonstrating patience and fortitude. If anyone is promoting ideas that are not consistent with the Church of Satan, but are trying to make it seem like they are affiliated, they will be warned to remove any confusing references that makes a connection with the Church of Satan.

For official Grottos, membership is a matter of the prospective Grotto member being already a Church of Satan member, and of equal importance that they are within traveling distance to the Grotto Master. After all, the essence of the Grotto system is to provide a point for socialization with people in a geographic proximity who are already C/S members (or who are simply waiting for their membership to be processed and are sponsored by the Grotto Master so we know that there is a sincere commitment). The Grotto may not accept into Second Level activities anyone who has not sent in their application for Church of Satan membership. We do not give the curious a \"taste\" of what our organization is like -- they may only attend First Level activities until they make the decision to become members and make the step of sending in the application.

Despite our previous efforts to make it clear that chat rooms are the property of their owners, who determine for themselves the house rules for these cyber-lairs, and that what happens in them has nothing to do with the Church of Satan, we continually receive complaints about the way people interact in these places. When people were dissatisfied with a particular chat room, they were told to form a new one of their own, which would then be their own place in which to chat with their friends and colleagues. This pertained to any and all members, and was not a \"special mandate\" that in any way singled out a room as being \"officially endorsed.\" This statement was willfully distorted by some members. We have observed this mode of communication, which originally was intended as a means for those who enjoy each other to carry on an online conversation, degenerate into a form of territoriality in which participants in different rooms form cliques and then try to act as if this is some sort of factionalism in the Church of Satan itself. It is not ; it is simply childish behavior on the part of members and even titled officials of our organization. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/chatroom.html (1 of 3) [8/18/2004 7:17:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Church of Satan Chat Room Policies Anton LaVey's model for the Church of Satan was for it to be a mutual admiration society amongst its members. He detested internal strife and would not stand for \"encounter group\" behavior. Undeserved rudeness and unwarranted contentiousness were anathema to him. His guide was simple: if you did not like a particular member, it is preferred that you simply cease to deal with that person, as the Church of Satan has never required its members to like one another or to interact with each other. Recall this Rule of the Earth: \"Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.\" But this simple protocol has been ignored by those who participate in chat rooms. The behavior therein is completely contradictory to the practices of the Church of Satan. Fortunately, the people who participate in this situation are very few, but because they are online, this has attracted unwarranted attention and has been made into an \"issue.\" We have had enough. Therefore, we no longer will point the way to any chat rooms. People cannot seem to grasp that even those rooms formed by members or officials in the Church of Satan are their possessions, not \"branches\" of the Church of Satan. It has been clearly proven to us that chat room participants cannot separate the personal doings of titled Church of Satan members from their titles, and thus falsely think that anything done by a titled member is somehow endorsed or done in the name of the Church of Satan. This is emphatically not true. Titled Church of Satan members' titles were granted for their personal achievements and their expertise in the philosophy codified by Anton LaVey. When they speak on this philosophy, it is the title which gives credence to their expertise. Their title is not \"wisdom insurance,\" however. The merits of their arguments on other topics must be evaluated objectively; any validity must be earned. Since it has also become abundantly clear that chat rooms have become primarily areas for airing personal conflicts, not the discussion of the philosophy of the Church of Satan, we must now state the following: All Church of Satan officials who participate in chat rooms do so as their personal business, and they do so without the support of the Church of Satan itself. Any titles or positions held by these members are considered invalid by the Church of Satan in chat room situations. Our titled members do not speak for the Church of Satan in chat rooms. If they attempt to flaunt their titles as convincers, they are abusing that title. If any individual wants elucidation on the philosophy of the Church of Satan, they are encouraged to read this website, to purchase the books listed on the Source Sheet page, and, in cases where they really can't find an answer to a question, to email our official online representative, Magistra Peggy Nadramia. Our official website has links to many sites created by our members. Some of them have chat rooms. If you choose to avail yourself of these rooms, whatever happens is solely your responsibility.

If you have read our books, you know that Satanism isn't about taking drugs, and it isn't about harming animals or children. Unlike many religions and philosophies, Satanism respects and exalts life. Children and animals are the purest expressions of that life force, and as such are held sacred and precious in the eyes of the Satanist. Besides, it is very un- Satanic to take any creature's life against its will. It is equally un-Satanic to cloud your brain and impair your judgment with mind-altering substances. A real magician has no need of those kinds of things, as he should be able to bring about changes in consciousness by the very power of his Will and imagination. If you have not yet read The Satanic Bible , you should do so. It has a lot more information on our attitude toward Satan, and will give you a clearer idea of our philosophy, ideals and goals. Perhaps at first they will be difficult for you to understand, because you may have been raised in an environment that dictates that God=Good and Satan=Evil. The truth is that good and evil are often terms that people twist to suit their own purposes. Sometimes people will lie and try to make you think certain things just so you will do what they want you to do. Always remember that the final judgment is yours. That is both a great freedom and a great responsibility. For us, Satan is a symbol of the power of that choice. There is no one way that a Satanist is \"supposed\" to be. Uniqueness and creativity are encouraged here, not mindless conformity. It doesn't matter what kind of music you like to listen to; it doesn't make any difference whether you prefer gothic music, black metal music, classical music, old popular tunes, or show tunes. It doesn't matter what style of clothes you like to wear. What does matter is that you are a mature, sensitive, self-aware individualist who revels in the Darkness, and who wishes to align yourself with others who share your views. In this world of prefabricated, media-saturated, unoriginal drones, it is up to the Satanist to cherish, maintain, and preserve true individuality and creativity. Satan represents freedom from hypocrisy, from convenient lies, and challenges that which is presumed to be true. He is strong and defiant, and inspires us to our own strengths. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/youthcommunique.html (1 of 5) [8/18/2004 7:22:50 PM]"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Church of Satan Youth Communiqu√© That said, let's address some of your most commonly asked questions: \"How old do I have to be to join the Church of Satan?\" You may become a member of the Church of Satan at any age, though further participation in the organization is limited to those who are eighteen years of age or older. This is not meant as a judgment of your maturity; we've received letters from 14-year-olds who had a distinct, mature grasp of Satanism. But we must be realistic about the world around us. One reason is that we don't want to become a haven for the kind of sanctimonious perverts that Christian churches and other \"Goodguy Badge\" forums (such as Big Brother/Big Sister, Boy Scouts, etc.) often are. There are a lot of sick people out there, and we don't want our vital young Satanists to become victims of twisted adults who are more interested in contacting young kids than they are in practicing Satanism. Another reason is because your parents or other adults in your life may not understand or might be hostile toward your exploration of this religion. They may try to cause trouble for us, falsely accusing us of any number of things, just because they feel threatened. So, we simply cannot allow anyone under the legal age of consent to participate in any activities directly sponsored by the Church of Satan. The only exception to this rule would be with the written permission and attendance of your parent or legal guardian. Some of you may be lucky enough to have a very good relationship with your parents and they may be supportive, even enthusiastic, about your exploration of the Dark Side. They may be willing to go with you to meet a local Grotto Master and decide on your level of participation at this point in your magical development. If this is the case, let us know. \"Do I have to become a member to be a 'real' Satanist?\" All you have to do to be a real Satanist is start living like one. Dr. LaVey wrote The Satanic Bible so that people could pick up a copy, read it, and know everything they need to know about Satanism and how to put it to work in their own lives. Most people who choose to become members do so as a symbolic act to themselves, to formally align themselves with others of like mind, and to show their support for a philosophy and way of life they agree with. It is a purely personal decision -- we don't solicit memberships. But actual membership usually conveys to others that you are serious about your beliefs, and that you know enough about it to have read Dr. LaVey's works and align yourself with his spearhead organization. It usually grants you a certain amount of respect as an authority. If you were going to speak as a member of the Church in a public forum, you should actually be one. If you were going to start a grotto affiliated with the Church of Satan, you'd have to be a member (again, you'd have to be over the age of eighteen). But as far as benefiting from Satanism in your life, or defending true Satanism, those are the rights and file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/youthcommunique.html (2 of 5) [8/18/2004 7:22:50 PM]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Church of Satan Youth Communiqu√© responsibilities of every Satanist, \"official\" or not. \"My parents and friends don't understand me, and don't approve of my interest in Satanism. How can I make them accept my beliefs, and where can I go to perform my rituals?\" Unfortunately, most young Satanists face this problem. Few of us are lucky enough to have sympathetic parents, or others around like ourselves. However, as long as you are living under your parents' roof and they are feeding and taking care of you, you do owe them a degree of consideration. Offer to let them read your books, and talk about what misunderstandings they may have from T.V. talk shows and Christian propaganda. But you can't force anyone to understand what, for you, is an obvious and magical revelation. If Satanism offends others who have necessary control over your life right now, do your studies and rituals in private. If you don't have a place at home where you can be alone, find a special spot on the beach, in a field, or in the woods where you can ritualize when you need to. While you are understandably enthusiastic about your new-found religion, it is not very Satanic to make yourself miserable by creating a problem with your parents when you have to live in the same house together, or at school where your real goal may be to aggravate those in authority in the guise of \"expressing your individuality.\" Practice Lesser Magic. Remember that a competent Satanic magician should be able to size up any situation and weigh his choices of action to bring about desired results. Enthusiasm is certainly encouraged and appreciated, however Satanism asks no one to be a martyr. And keep in mind that most people simply aren't going to understand because, ultimately, they don't want to. That is as it should be. Satanism is not for everyone. Satan, by his very nature, walks alone. He is the true individualist, the outcast. This doesn't mean that you cannot care about those who are close to you; Satan also represents love, kindness and respect to those who deserve it. It just means that you should not concern yourself with people who do not approve of you. Revel in your uniqueness; be proud of who and what you are. Achieve all you can with the strength and determination of Satan himself coursing proudly through your veins. When Satanism leads to positive changes in your accomplishments and attitude, your parents and other adults around you will notice. The best way you can represent Satanism is by providing a living example of how the diabolical arts have made you a stronger, more focused person. The results will speak louder than any logical argument you can present. \"Is it better to study and ritualize alone, or to work with others?\" Unless you are able to find others who are as knowledgeable about Satanism as you are, it is better to work alone. If you do choose to ritualize with others, you must make certain that they are 100% clear on what Satanism is all about. If they are into it just out of curiosity or for thrills, they'll get their thrills all right -- the wrong kind!

It's often best for you to work and study alone, guided by the material in our literature, rather than have your magic and concentration diluted by would-be friends. As the saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. What that means in this case is that if you perform rituals with others who are not as serious and dedicated as you are, they will hinder your magic, not strengthen it. Many adult Satanists work and study alone by choice. Finding a true magical partner can be stimulating and rewarding, but if you need such a person in your magical progression, you'll conjure one up (see Herman Hesse's Demian or Illusions by Richard Bach). Don't be disturbed or frightened or think you're crazy when you feel contacted by the Dark Ones you conjure forth, or by the magical results you begin to produce. You're not crazy for feeling the way you do about the hypocrisy, blindness and incompetence you see all around you. Nor are you crazy to see the results of your Black Magic. Approach the Dark Masters with the proper degree of respect and decorum -- that's what rituals are for, to establish a relationship. If you approach the demons respectfully, they will reward you with knowledge, guidance, and success. Your demon guide is within you -- don't look for it outside. You just have to contact that part of yourself and listen to it. That is the most important work anyone can do. \"Do I need all the things mentioned in The Satanic Bible to do my rituals?\" You don't need everything mentioned in Dr. LaVey's books to do an effective ritual. Maybe you don't have the money to obtain, or the private space to store, items such as swords, chalices, black robes, gongs and elaborate altars. Here is a powerful ritual you can perform tonight, and all you need is a quiet place where you can be alone, a Baphomet either on your person or in front of you, and a single black candle: Light the candle and set it before you. Sit up straight, breathe deeply and relax. Clear your mind of all outside thoughts. As you gaze at the flame, say in your mind or out loud, \"I am ready, oh, Dark Lord. I feel your strength within me and wish to honor you in my life. I am one of the Devil's Own. Hail Satan!\" Open your mind. It will take time. You may think you are ready, but you may still find you cannot let go right away. Concentrate on your image of Satan and on the word \"strength\" and listen to what comes up from yourself. You have answers for yourself that no one else can give you. This is a simple way of conjuring Satan into your life. He'll snap you into line and tell you what you have to do to be happy, strong and focused -- and he'll give you the stamina and courage to push yourself to do it. The path you've chosen won't be easy; sometimes it may be a nightmare.

The Church of Satan will be here when you are ready, and if your commitment is strong and sincere, you will benefit from this time. Your family and friends might be concerned at first because they've been brainwashed about what Satanism is. If they love you, when they see the positive changes that occur due to your new dedication to Satanism (and most of all, to yourself) they'll try to understand and support you. Best wishes for further success and fulfillment. You are with us.

We have, since 1966, stood as the most formidable threat to those who would halt progress in the name of spirituality. We are explorers on the untrodden paths of science, human motivation and mystery -- all that is most truly occult. Those who proudly carry our red cards identifying themselves as members have the strength and dedication to implement the tools of Satan, the imagination to confound and confuse, the wisdom to recognize the Unseen in our society, and the passions of a classical Romantic soul. Regarding contact with non-members Many people write to the Church of Satan who have read some of our literature but want to further their knowledge through personal contact before they decide to affiliate. It has always been our policy NOT to place non-members in contact with members , as an individual's membership is held in strictest confidence by the Church of Satan. This does not reflect upon the sincerity of the person making the inquiry, but as realists, we acknowledge that Satanism remains a controversial religion and thus our policy is an important matter of security for our members. The protection of our members is one of the reasons we gather information through our extensive questionnaire about the people who affiliate and wish Active Membership participation. We attempt to make it reasonably certain that those whom we accept may interact safely and responsibly with our other members. Individuals who have not yet affiliated are an unknown quantity, and realistically, we cannot trust those whom we do not yet know. However, for non-members who want to interact with other Satanists (those who have placed themselves in public by personal choice), we suggest that you participate in the message board on personalsatan.com called Letters to the Devil upon which many people file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/Affiliation.htm (1 of 8) [8/17/2004 3:52:04 AM]"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Affiliation who call themselves Satanists (as well as many Church of Satan members) exchange their thoughts. This board is moderated, so time-wasting posts by Christians and pseudo-Satanic kooks are removed. This forum has general areas open to anyone, as well as \"members only\" areas which can be accessed once one joins the Church of Satan and presents proof of membership to those who run this board. Membership has its privileges. A word to the wise: since Satanism is a philosophy which holds individualism as one of its main values, we don't expect all of our members to agree on everything, or even to \"get along\" with each other. Thus, you are cautioned that you might find some differences of opinion in these discussions. Satanism, by definition, is a philosophy in which you won't find \"group hugs\" as part of the repertoire. Also, since only a very small percentage of our members choose to interact with people online, it would be an error to think that your online experience is necessarily a reflection upon what your personal experience with the Church of Satan might be. That is an Is-To-Be that is in the hands of each individual who chooses to join. The Red Card of membership is just a key -- it is up to you to open the door and earn the attention of those already in the organization. Registered Membership We don't solicit memberships; however, if you wish to join us, to show your support or appreciation, you can become a Registered Member . For a one-time registration fee of two hundred dollars in United States currency , you will receive an impressively- embossed crimson card declaring you a member of the Church of Satan. This card is your means for identifying yourself as a genuine member of the Church of Satan to other members. If you expect to meet another member for the first time, be prepared to produce your card. Likewise, you may be expected to produce a scan of your card to certify your membership to other members online. No further dues will be expected. There are no further obligations. There are no age requirements. See our Satanic Youth communiqu√© for clarification of this issue. Follow the instructions at the bottom of this page to become a Registered Member. If you represent yourself as affiliated with the Church of Satan, you are legally required to register with us as a member. Active Membership If you wish to take a more active role in the Church of Satan, we require that you become an Active Member . This requires that you are of at least 18 years of age, and that you fill out an Active Membership Application , indicating your more serious interest in our organization. By completing and returning it (by snail-mail -- we'll let you know when e- mail applications will be accepted), you will be included in our E-Bulletin List (the file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/Affiliation.htm (2 of 8) [8/17/2004 3:52:04 AM]"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Affiliation mailing schedule for this is \"as needed\") so you can receive announcements pertinent to your affiliation. Your file will also be reviewed for further involvement; we have Grottos/affiliates/Special Interest Groups of all persuasions who are working on many fronts toward the fulfillment of our Satanic destiny. There is no additional charge for a Registered Member to apply for Active Membership. You may even pay for your Registered Membership and include your Application for Active Membership at the same time. The Grotto System We have reestablished our system by which individuals in geographic proximity may form an association for ritualization, socialization, and the pursuit of various projects. Each local cabal is called a Grotto , reinforcing the hidden and mysterious aspect of the Church of Satan. Grottos are established by individuals who are granted the status of Grotto Master . When filling out the questionnaire, indicate that you are interested in Grotto activities in your area. If there are, the local Grotto Master will contact you to arrange a meeting to evaluate you for participation. Be aware that it is within the rights of the Grotto Master to deem you unsuitable for participation in his Grotto, even though you are a bona fide member of the Church of Satan. This does not reflect on your membership in the Church of Satan itself, only that particular Grotto. If there are no Grottos presently in your locale, you may apply to be recognized as a Grotto Master, allowing you to helm your own Grotto. Grotto Masters receive an in-depth manual to assist them in their efforts as well as guide them through the difficulties that might be encountered. Grotto Masters are not de facto spokespersons for the Church of Satan. They are encouraged to represent Satanism in whatever situations may arise, but they do not speak for the Church of Satan unless they are members of the representational hierarchy, which is our Priesthood. Special situations might arise locally in which permission is given for a Grotto Master who has not yet attained the Priesthood to act as a spokesperson for a specific situation. Only a small percentage of our membership participates in Grotto activities. We do not give out information concerning the location of Grottos to nonmembers. If a local Grotto has a public profile or a web presence, then nonmembers may learn of its existence. Many Grottos choose to remain \"underground,\" fulfilling the nature of that word. If you are considering affiliation with the Church of Satan solely for the purpose of Grotto activities, we suggest that you reconsider. Affiliation must primarily be a result of philosophical agreement, not the desire for socializing. We are not a huddling flock of sheep in wolves' clothing. Understand that if you wish to pursue group activities using the Church of Satan as an identity, you are legally required to be a Registered Member of the Church of Satan. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/Affiliation.htm (3 of 8) [8/17/2004 3:52:04 AM]"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Affiliation When you fill out the Active Membership Application, note the question about Grotto Activities and Grotto Master status and answer accordingly. If you ask to be considered for Grotto Master status, we will send you the Grotto Master Application. If you are already an Active Member and wish to apply for Grotto Master status, email us with a scan of your membership card at GMApplication@churchofsatan.com and we'll forward the application to you. Hierarchy Anton LaVey formulated a system of degrees during the early years of the Church of Satan, as such was a general practice in many prior social and esoteric organizations. However, the criteria for elevation in our Church were based not on mysticism or occultism, but on knowledge of practical subjects beyond Satanism, and even more than that, on the application of such wisdom towards measurable ends. Dr. LaVey experimented by mandating the specific colors for medallions which could be worn by each member according to degree. And, for a time, written exams were given to assess a member‚Äôs readiness for a particular level. In the mid 1970s, it became clear that many members had become obsessed with ‚Äújockeying for position‚Äù‚Äîbeing overly concerned with their place in the organization rather than working towards advancement in the world ‚Äúoutside.‚Äù This was contrary to our carnal philosophy‚Äôs emphasis on tangible personal progress and so, after that point, the existence of the degrees was de-emphasized in Church literature, and formulaic methods for recognition were jettisoned. Today, we maintain our traditional degrees, but these should not be seen as ‚Äúinitiatory steps‚Äù which are expected of our members. The Church of Satan is not an initiatory organization. It is our position that, for those with awareness, by living fully you will have plenty of authentic initiatory experiences through the many avenues you explore, hence there is no need for such artificial posturing in our Church. In fact, no member is required to move beyond Registered Membership. The First Degree denoting Active Membership is only for members who seek more involvement with the organization and other local members. The remaining degrees (from the Second through the Fifth) are not open to application or to request. Our specific standards for them will not be publicly released. The administration watches the progress of qualified members, and may choose to grant recognition to outstanding individuals based on demonstrated excellence in the understanding and communication of Satanic Theory, coupled with significant potent practices in the arena of the real world which have produced superior achievements. People naturally and quite organically rise to particular levels, and we may take note at our discretion. This is meritocracy at work. So, if you are so inclined, keep us updated on your accomplishments so that your progress may be noted.

Those who hold the Third through Fifth degrees are all members of the Priesthood of Mendes and individuals with these titles may be called ‚ÄúReverend.‚Äù Our protocol for member interaction is based on the paradigm of a ‚Äúmutual admiration society.‚Äù We do not expect all of our highly individualistic members to like each other, but we do require that they behave as ladies and gentlemen when dealing with each other in all situations and forums. Interaction is never required, and in the case of extreme disagreement wherein civility apparently cannot be maintained, we expect involved members to cease interaction with each other. Violation of this standard can be grounds for expulsion. Agents An individual who demonstrates a thorough grasp of the philosophy of the Church of Satan, and would like to be a contact for local media or other interested parties, and who is not interested in Grotto Activities, may be chosen to serve as an Agent for the Church of Satan. As your expertise and influence in the real world expands, you will then be considered for recognition to our Priesthood. When you fill out your application for further involvement, let us know if you would like to be considered to be a qualified contact point in your area or for media representation. You may also include material which demonstrates your qualifications, such as samples of your writing and video tapes (VHS format) of yourself in a public speaking mode. Priesthood of Mendes These are the individuals who act as spokespersons for the philosophy of the Church of Satan, which include the titles of Priest/Priestess, Magister/Magistra. Members of the Priesthood make up the Council of Nine , which is the ruling body of the organization, responsible to the High Priest/Priestess. The Order of the Trapezoid consists of the individuals who assist in the administration of the Church of Satan.

Thus, you may (even as a member), encounter members of our Priesthood and never know it. Membership in the Priesthood is by invitation only . We watch the progress of qualified members, and grant recognition for achievement. This is meritocracy at work. If you have not already done so, we strongly suggest you purchase The Satanic Bible , and study it. It is a diabolical book, the basis for our philosophy. There is currently a great deal of literature available by our founder as well as other Satanic pioneers. See the internal document called Satanic Books and Magazines for additional information.

We are an international organization and that is our central administrative point. There are NO \"local branches or contacts\" through which one becomes a member. Once your membership is accepted, then you may snail mail a signed letter with a request to be placed in contact with local members who share interest in such contact, or with a Grotto -- should there be one in your area. And, of course, you may mark the spot on the Active Membership Application noting these interests. Because of the very high volume of mail received at the Central Administrative Office, as well as the small staff (which has other projects besides processing memberships), it may take some time for the membership to be processed, and we give 16 weeks as the maximum time. If you haven't heard back in more than 16 weeks, email us ( membership@churchofsatan.com) with the details (your full name, snail mail address [and tell us if there have been any changes], and when you applied), and we'll look into the situation. We do not track each piece of mail as it arrives, so if you want to be certain that we have received your materials, we suggest you send them with some form of return receipt card, which the post office will return to you, thus confirming to you that we have your mailing. About the Membership Fee We must emphasize that you don't have to join our organization to consider yourself a Satanist, you only need to recognize yourself in The Satanic Bible and live according to the tenets outlined therein. We don't proselytize, or otherwise campaign for people to join -- that is your prerogative. We have supplied this information which explains how you can affiliate if you so choose. The $200 US lifetime membership registration fee is about the same as the price of a decent pair of shoes in the United States -- which certainly won't last a lifetime. Most Christian churches will charge you a tithe that counts for 10% of your yearly income -- membership in them is not free, as so many assume. If you are an individual of limited financial resources who wishes to become a member, we suggest that you put the money aside piecemeal, and join when you have saved it up -- we'll still be here. We don't expect people to put aside important things in their life in favor of joining our organization -- Satanists abhor the idea of sacrifice. For those who think we ask too much, we suggest that you look to your other possessions and expenses (most people spend far more than this amount on general entertainment). We've discovered that most individuals can muster these funds if membership is something they truly desire. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/Affiliation.htm (7 of 8) [8/17/2004 3:52:04 AM]"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Affiliation Bear in mind that our church has real people doing work, such as corresponding with individuals, and otherwise helping to run an international organization (postage, paper, computers, email accounts, and so on are not free). Our administrative staff's time is precious -- isn't yours? Also, we are emphatically not altruists. We're Satanists, so we expect to be compensated for our time and efforts. The fee could be much more, and we haven't raised it in many years. So, our reasoning is quite simple, and we think it is an amazing bargain. If you disagree, then you don't have to affiliate with us. Dis-Affiliation Resignation : It is a simple matter for a member to terminate his affiliation with the Church of Satan. One simply needs to write, sign, and date a letter (hard copy only -- e-mail resignation is not accepted), stating \"I hereby resign my membership in the Church of Satan.\" Send this letter, along with your membership card, to our Central Administrative Office and your file will be officially closed. Administrative Termination : Memberships may be terminated at the discretion of the ruling body consisting of the High Priest, the High Priestess, and the Council of Nine. Criteria for such action is based upon principles outlined in The Satanic Bible and on the Bunco Sheet, as well as for personal actions on the part of the member which are deemed inconsistent with continued membership by the ruling body. There will be no refunding of the $200 Registration Fee for either resignation or for administrative termination of membership. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/Affiliation.htm (8 of 8) [8/17/2004 3:52:04 AM]"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"W e were established in 1966 c.e. by Anton Szandor LaVey, who declared the Year One, thus opening the W e were established in 1966 c.e. by Anton Szandor LaVey, who declared the Year One, thus opening the W fl oodgates to a revolution designed to smash the hypocrisy and unreason which has reigned for the W fl oodgates to a revolution designed to smash the hypocrisy and unreason which has reigned for the W past 2000 years.

Paradise] \"What is Satanism?\" Satanism, the first carnal religion in human history, was codified and established by Anton Szandor LaVey (1930-1997) with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966 C.E. (Year One). It is a religion and a philosophy based on man as he really is: a carnal being free from the fiction that is spirituality and one who champions total responsibility, pragmatism, and the here-and-now. Currently, the Church of Satan is headed by High Priest Peter H. Gilmore, High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and Magistra Blanche Barton. Additional information on Church of Satan hierarchical structure, policies, updates, and more can be found at the CoS website. Satanism has been referred to as an \"unreligion\" in the sense that it does not subscribe to the notion of an anthropomorphic deity and, by extension, some being who must be worshiped, its most common misconception. Others say that Satanism is challenging popular notions of how 'religion' is defined, not content with the dictates of Judeo-Christian strictures. Both are valid opinions. But for those who feel that deity worship and religion must be and always have been inextricably bound, it should be noted that Satanism's lack of deity belief and deity worship is not singular as Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism (all considered religions the world over) also share this viewpoint. Also, the concept of a literal \"Satan\" which infiltrates people's lives and influences their decisionmaking is exclusively Christian, and decidedly not Satanic. Satanism is further described as being a de facto personality type as, in the words of Anton LaVey, \"Satanists are born, not made.\" To try is to lie. It takes a certain set of predispositions to accurately label oneself a Satanist, to naturally feel at home with all that Satanism entails. Satanism, as a philosophy, can be potentially taken and learned from by a large percentage of the population, but this does not make one a Satanist, but, perchance, Satanic. Qualities such as cowardice, insecurity, self-loathing, drug addiction, stupidity, constant life failures, unconditional niceness, and lack of direction (and there are MANY more) are clear indicators that the person in question and the title of Satanist are NOT compatible. For such a person, Satanism isn't a direct reflection of one's core (as it is with Satanists), it can only be a human improvement program at best, which is valid on that level only. This is one distinction that many, be they Satanic \"hopeful\" or earnest researcher, would be better off to recognize. It must be stressed that critically reading The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey is tantamount to understanding at least the basics of Satanism. It is the definitive tome of Satanism and cannot be avoided if accurate knowledge of Satanism is desired. As supplement (read: not replacement), perusing some of the Satanic magazines published by Church of Satan members and officials will lend some insight into Satanism in motion, as a productive model. And of course, websites published by these same folks file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/faq.htm (1 of 6) [8/17/2004 3:02:21 AM]"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Not Like Most: Satanism FAQ (including myself) are also useful. Conversely, we do not officially advocate chat rooms and message boards as viable sources of Satanic information. Membership in the Church of Satan is completely voluntary and not required in order to be a Satanist. \"Who is Satan?\" In Satanism, Satan is an archetype, a representation of certain qualities that the Satanist embodies including rational self-interest, avoidance of oppressive mentalities, the questioning of all, and a perseverance towards success and human potential. The Satanic Bible encapsulates this iconography in The Nine Satanic Statements, which are thus: 1) Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence! 2) Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams! 3) Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self-deceit! 4) Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates! 5) Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek! 6) Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires! 7) Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his \"divine spiritual and intellectual development,\" has become the most vicious animal of all! 8) Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification! 9) Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years! Inherently, the Satanic archetype is far more diverse than the limited Christian interpretation -- the name/word is notably pre-Christian: from the Hebrew, meaning \"adversary\", \"opposer\" or \"one who questions\" (and the Jewish 'Satan' differs sharply from the Christian one in many ways). Even its etymology is traced back through sources previous to its Hebrew version, from Shaitan (Persian) all the way back to Set (Egyptian). Satanism, to one degree or another, embraces additional cultural and religious ideas, concepts and imagery such as those of ancient Rome and ancient Greece, Zoroasterism, Asatru, Aztec, Hindu and a multitude of others. We also find the Satanic persona emanating from some or all of the literary works of Milton, Nietzsche, Mencken, Maugham, Twain, Rand, Jung, and many more. \"Where can I find an online version of The Satanic Bible?\" The Satanic Bible is a copyrighted work. Portions may be used in quotations or used for educational purposes (such as the Fair Use laws of the United States dictate), but there is some hefty litigation potentially awaiting the fool who offers the entire tome electronically. LaVey's death also does not negate this copyright: the work is secured until, at the very soonest, 2047 C.E.

Collectively, there are so many sellers of Church of Satan-approved books worldwide with so many shipping and payment options that there is no excuse (and we've heard them all) for not being able to legally acquire or purchase them. If you come across a site that is illegally posting portions or whole versions of Church of Satan books, please report them to the CoS Head of Security, Andre Schlesinger at MANINBLACK@nyc.rr.com. At this point, Avon/HarperCollins and Feral House (the publishers) as well as the Internet Service Provider hosting it will all be contacted and action may be taken on a legal level. Noncompliance with removal of this material often results in the loss of the webmaster's ISP account as well. \"What is the difference between Satanism and devil worship?\" Satanism and devil worship are two distinctly different animals. Devil worship is what it is: the worship of an external deity (in this case, a \"devil\"), much as it could be labeled inverse Christianity -- that is, confining yourself to the Christian religion and overall model, but merely choosing the \"bad guy\" in their Bible instead of the purportedly central character. The Satan in Satanism is an archetype, one many know by name and is relative to the culture. Some Satanists choose different aspects of this archetype, depending on geography or just plain aesthetics, but the same characteristics still hold true. It would make little sense for us to claim to embody the archetypal qualities of Satan (rebellion, rational self- interest, carnality, etc.) on one hand, and then attempt to worship an anthropomorphic Satan on the other. In laymen's terms, it's hardly rebellious to worship a figure that represents rebellion. The Satanist finds unproductive and one-sided idol worship to be draining and useless (not to mention hypocritical). Much of this is aptly mentioned in The Satanic Bible and the other books listed in the Satanism section of this website. \"Are all of those atrocious and illegal acts people say you commit true?\" The Church of Satan harshly frowns upon the commision of any illegal act. If you choose to do so, you do it of your own volition and without the approval and consent of the Church of Satan. That is free will and it has consequences. We have stated since the inception that Satanism has nothing to do with animal or human sacrifice (the top of page 89 of The Satanic Bible states this in black and white, quite clearly). Likewise, we are against child molestation because we hold children in such high regard, seeing them as natural magicians, beings much closer to their nature than most of the consumer-programmed adults out there. If a Church of Satan member is convicted for a serious crime, particularly a violent one and one that violates the tenets of Satanism, that person's membership is often revoked. And, yes, we have kicked people out of the CoS. \"Why do you say 'Hail Satan'?\" file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/faq.htm (3 of 6) [8/17/2004 3:02:21 AM]"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Not Like Most: Satanism FAQ In addition to what is stated before considering how we contextualize Satan, this is my take on this fairly common question: 1) \"'Hail Satan!' (the exclamation point is optional, though preferred) is often another way of saying 'Hail Me!' Since we Satanists embody the qualities of The Great Archetype, Satan, it stands to reason that the phrase is both apropos and analogous. You very well could say 'Hail Me!' instead, but keep in mind this... 2) \"'Hail Satan!' is also a salute to our achievements (both collective and, more importantly, individual), ethics, and heritage. It is a statement of pride in defiance of a polyglot, egalitarian, and ignorant way of life represented by the nauseating Christ ethos and its followers. If we have signed any pact with Satan, it is this. \"What do you mean by 'Alien Elite'?\" We use the phrase, \"Alien Elite\" to describe ourselves. Often, it is the shortsightedness of people that disallows them to comprehend what this phrase means, even if they've read all of our books, magazines, and websites. Typically, they skip the word \"alien.\" A big mistake, considering that it is an important modifier in the term. What it means is that we, as Satanists, are largely alien in the society at large: we do not generally subscribe to the disposable, consumer-obsessed culture that others do, our issues are different, the stands we take are often neither right nor left but something else entirely (one aspect of what we refer to as The Third Side), we question everything in a world that mostly goes along with established thought and rarely inquires as to how or why, and we simply represent something that most do not (some could say that we are not like most) -- all of this is in step with the archetype of Satan which we embrace. And we also embrace this alienation. By living such a pure and undiluted life, we are, in many ways, better than most of the human sheep. By being a minority (and we will always be a minority due to the laws of nature -- she simply does not give all of her gifts to all people) and possessing pragmatic and forward-thinking values that are above the interest of the masses, plus adding the intellect and instinct, the creativity and the resourcefulness, and all of those qualities reflected in our books, we are indeed the Alien Elite. In short, word usage and context matter. \"Anton LaVey is merely ripping off other philosophers.\" Extremely limited (and limiting) thinking, indeed. When LaVey refers to an idea, concept, or quote derived or taken from someone else, he often cites the author, either in the paragraph or in the indices of his books. If anything LaVey writes seems or is similar to past concepts, oftentimes, it is augmented with modern circumstances, his own thoughts, and is analogous to our philosophy. Seeing that Satanism is a work in progress, something like science meets philosophy, we are fully justified in choosing the concepts of old, working with them in our context and taking them into the future. (If we didn't, who else would?) Same thing scientists, doctors, psychologists, and many other professionals do. Nothing would get done if individuals merely went along with established thought and never added to it. It's evolution, pure and simple. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/faq.htm (4 of 6) [8/17/2004 3:02:21 AM]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Not Like Most: Satanism FAQ \"The Church of Satan charges application fees for membership and further involvement and accepts money from people. Sounds like your garden-variety tent-show evangelist scam.\" First off, you are probably confusing two different terms. The Church of Satan is an organization. Satanism is a religion. Since we are one of the few (if not, one of the ONLY) religions whose organized body REJECTS the tax exempt status other religions cling to, the CoS accepts money to keep it moving, and we pay BACK into the economic system. (This is but one manifestation of our ethic, \"Responsibility to the responsible.\") The money that the Church of Satan receives for its unsolicited memberships and fees goes to administrative costs, such as those incurred by any other organization. If a credible Satanist pays into the CoS, he or she does this in support, and does it with the mindfulness that any true Satanist possesses. You don't even have to be a member of the CoS to be a Satanist, so no money is required in that capacity, unlike that required by others for tithes, collection plates, and holy corn meal. The monetary fee, by extension, also keeps out most of the unwanted trend chaser and occult dabbler types. \"I really want to join the Church of Satan... I mean, A LOT! I want to be a Priest and be one of you. I want magical powers and a direct phone-line to Satan.\" The Church of Satan is an organization which recognizes worth in individuals based on actual achievement in the real world. Titles in the Church of Satan are strictly based on such concrete qualities, and are not achievements in and of themselves. Aside from Registered Membership, all Church of Satan titles are granted by appointment only and for which cannot be applied. This is, no doubt, of great dismay to those who wish to claim Satanic affiliation in an \"official\" sense yet lack personal success, direction, or influence upon their daily lives. Since we reject spirituality as patent nonsense, we are not interested in those chasing after occult monikers or access to some imaginary wellspring of magical power \"out there.\" Further details on CoS hierarchical structure are at its official website. \"As a representative for Satanism, you do interviews and lectures. Isn't this preaching? And, doesn't this violate your rule of not giving your opinions unless asked?\" Of course this isn't preaching and it doesn't go against the First Satanic Rule of the Earth. If you open a magazine, turn on your radio, or click on your television and see an interview with a Satanist, you've reached a point where you will either not read or look at it, or you will. If you choose the latter, you have consigned yourself to the information and, by your own actions, have given your non-verbal consent to receive such information about our religion. If you attend a lecture, you have even more so welcomed yourself to our 'opinions.' No one coerced you to attend or read or watch or listen. Assuming that Satanism can be preached is to assume that anyone can be a Satanist, which is grossly false. We know this and wouldn't bother proselytizing like other religions. It would waste our time and we'd have to care, which we don't. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/faq.htm (5 of 6) [8/17/2004 3:02:21 AM]"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Not Like Most: Satanism FAQ \"Where can I find a Satanic Grotto in (name of obscure, far-flung corner of the globe) and what are their specific rules, guidelines and aims?\" If you wish to know whether there is a Grotto (an official subgroup of the Church of Satan) in your area in which you can participate, you must do two things: first, join the Church of Satan; second, apply through the CoS for grotto involvement. Only after these two steps will you be put in official contact with a Grotto Master, after which, the GM decides whether or not you are to be included in that specific group. Since every Grotto is different, they will widely vary from one to the other, though united under a few basic guidelines. If you are merely wondering whether there is a group in your area, write to the Church of Satan directly (and not to me) and they will take it from there. Their postal and e-mail addresses are found at the official CoS website. \"Can you tell me about (random diabolical myth figure from some ancient culture)?\" Few ideologies stress more than Satanism the championing of self-assertiveness, of self-achievement and seeking things out for yourself, though most who ask the above question are not keeping that in mind. It is recommended that the aforequoted should be refocused into making the effort to do the research on such yourself. If you ask this question to various GMs, Priests, and Magistri, don't be surprised if you are ignored. They're sending you the biggest hint they can, which is to find the info out for yourself. \"After reading the FAQ and looking over your website, I want you to give me MORE. Would you answer my long list of questions?\" If you have really read The Satanic Bible and related books, critically read some of our better magazines, and really paid attention to the websites with legitimate information on them, then you have MORE than enough of a jumpstart towards further knowledge. (What do you think those pre-Internet folks such as us did? We actually took the initiative and worked for what we know. Don't be surprised if we don't jump to your beck and call every time you have a question.) The rest is up to you. Apply what you know and see what happens. It is not the job of any CoS member or administrator to hold your hand and lead you down the Left-Hand Path. That journey is a solitary one, as any true individual knows. file:///Macintosh%20HD/Documents/purgingtalon.com/!!CoSpdf/!!html/faq.htm (6 of 6) [8/17/2004 3:02:21 AM]"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Credits Credits First and foremost, I would like to thank High Priest Gilmore for his oblique contribution to this document, as he is the webmaster of churchofsatan.com and, hence, scripted many of the webpages from which much of the provided text was gathered.
