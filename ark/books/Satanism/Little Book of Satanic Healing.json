"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 9 When it comes to Theistic Satanism, few works exist, and so I am blessed to have received this work, an immanation of Satan, and to have been given some inspiration on this path from the internet. The dedication ritual includes some information on the history of Satanism from the book Satanism Today by James R. Lewis. The demonic attunement includes information about the arch demons from Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly Palmer Hall. I also received suggestions from zeit23geist, who is perhaps the most well known internet writer with a focus primarily on Satanic healing in recent years, who edited this book and provided the review on the back cover. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 10 Introduction to Setim When Patrick Zeigler, the creator of Seichim, first heard the word Seichim from a spirit channeled through a friend, he heard it as 'Setim'; that is, an immanation of Set or Satan, a flowing of Satan into him. He had experienced an initiation into Seichim when he sneaked into the Great Pyramid of Gaza, near Sakara, Egypt, at night, where he perhaps should not have been, to discover a gate had been left open for him, and gone into complete blackness. He lay in a tomb of the dead, and wrapped himself like one embalmed. He saw the infinity symbol coming towards him, the base for one form of the alchemical symbol for brimstone- a Satanic symbol. It empowered him with the ability to transmit a new healing energy. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 11 Seichim is considered to be from the star Sirius or Sopdet, which can be seen from within the Great Pyramid, and has been equated with Set and Satan and bringing his energies into this world. Sekhem, another word used by New- Agers for Seichim, is magical power, which Set employs, and also is the power of the dead who dwell in Sekhem, a fiery part of the Egyptian afterlife, a familiar-sounding place. Some practitioners consider Seichim to have a relationship with Sekhmet. These lightworker practitioners feel safe with Sekhmet, although they wouldn't knowingly have anything to do with Satan. However, Sekhmet is a fierce goddess of destruction, plague and war, who some say is the female aspect of Satan. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 12 In some Egyptian tales, Sekhmet went into a frenzy of killing. Sekhmet is sometimes invoked by Satanists. Anton LaVey calls upon Sekhmet in a cursing ritual in his book The Satanic Bible. She can cause illness, but also ward off or cure it. This book deals with the healing use of Setim, if you are interested in Sekhmet and magickal work with her I would recommend the Papyri Graecae Magicae. If you are interested in using the power of Setim to curse, you are welcome to experiment. I'm not intrinsically anti- cursing, I'm not covering it here purely for the reason that it is not the subject of the current work. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 13 Some Satanists question the role of healing in Satanism: they say that Satan is solely a destructive and adversarial force, which drives evolution by allowing the weak to fail, and say he would not intervene to help them. These people are usually the ones who would be the first to get a whiff of gas, if the Nazism which the social Darwinism of their beliefs resembles came into force from the state. They are frequently the mentally ill, substance abusers, or those unable to form relationships, saying these things to make themselves feel more powerful. At some times in our lives we are all weak or ill, it's the nature of mortality. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 14 Satan is the patron god of theistic Satanists, their benefactor, supporter and protector who will try His utmost to look after His own, which includes their loved ones if his followers pray to Satan about them. He will also seek to help those not entirely committed to him if they offer him some respect, perhaps they will be theistic Satanists in future, or helping a particular individual is part of His plan. A person to whom you feel you are supposed to give Satanic healing may well be destined to be a Satanist of some kind. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 15 Setim contains the serpent energy, which helps overcome repression, gain positive individuality, and make you feel less powerless. Results in the real world may happen quickly after working on an issue with Setim. The Bible and fundamentalist Christians say that the healing of Satan is false and intended to lead people astray; but they would say that, wouldn't they? The bible has much to tell us about Satan, (for instance, that he has healing powers) but when reading it to learn about Him, what it says should always be read from the perspective that it is written by those who are against him, as they want people to serve Yahweh. Theistic Satanists have more than a kinship with all other religions, and most Christian denominations. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 16 According to evangelical Christians, all we other religions, such as Hinduism, which has the appearance of many gods, are actually worshipping the same god- Satan. A simi larity can also be seen between Theistic Satanism and Islam in one respect, although of course not in other ways. They believe in the Will of God, determinism, which I have some sympathy for, as it's clear with the misfortunes people suffer, such as most illnesses, that humans aren't entirely in co ntrol. However I appreciate most Satanists instead emphasize the power of free will. Of course as well as petitioning Satan, we all have to do what we can in the real world to help or heal ourselves, including using healing techniques if we find them helpful. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 17 Common sense Satan is Lord of this World, and He has some influence over the whole universe. However, He expects and honours the fact that much of the universe such as each living being has its own ideas, agenda and plans. He determines a lot of the events than happen, or can help us overcome or deal with them. By overcoming obstacles, we develop. Setim works to change our state of health and happiness, and sometimes change is painful. If people experience extra symptoms after a healing or attunement, some new age practitioners believe it's a 'healing crisis,' which they deal with using more alternative therapies. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 18 I don't believe in 'healing crises' except insomuch as attunement and healing leads to more awareness of problems which may need attention, or renewed attention, from a doctor, though other therapies can be used alongside medical treatment if you wish. Better safe than sorry. Some people have become more ill by failing to consult a doctor at the right time, due to being told they were experiencing a healing crisis and needed only time and alternative therapies to overcome it. Follow medical and governmental recommendations. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 19 Another common sense aid to healing practices is to retain normality in your life. A lot of people fall into fad diets now and again, but try to maintain a normal diet and not cut out foods. A woman needs around 2000 calories a day, and a man 2500. If you are overweight or underweight, remove or add calories until you reach a healthy weight, following a sensible diet. As a guideline, 500 less calories a day will lead to a loss of 1lb a week, and more can be lost be increasing your amount of exercise. Try to socialize regularly, in ordinary venues such as a pub, coffee shop or club. Do some exercise (eating enough to stay healthy while exercising of course, and exercising in accordance with what your doctor recommends.) "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 20 A balanced diet, including enough fluids, socializing, and doing what we can using everyday and evidence-based scientific methods to maintain or improve our health and fitness is what helps us stay grounded and not disappear up our own spiritual centre (to use a euphemism). It stops us developing more psychosomatic disorders, 'allergies' not confirmed by a medical practitioner, obsessions, and negative beliefs. Increase your healing with evidence-based healthy lifestyle changes, such as drinking less, giving up smoking and recreational drugs. Personally I enjoy staying in touch with what's on television, celebrity gossip and trends. This helps me stay grounded and in touch with what people in the real world are doing, enhancing my enjoyment of life. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 21 It’s more grounding than solely reading or watching spiritual works. I don't watch everything though, it shouldn't be a chore, and we don't all have the same tastes. There's no need to take on negative energies from clients, and if you find yourself feeling this is happening, ground yourself with diet and exercise, self-treatment and everyday activities. If it's very uncomfortable, check with your doctor that your symptoms don't have another cause. If it happens repeatedly, ask yourself why you need these symptoms. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 22 For Theistic Satanists and Others One of the possible differences in approach between theistic Satanists and new age practitioners who practice Seichim is that we are theists and ask for the aid of a personal (i.e. having his own personality and selfhood) god, Satan. New Agers may sometimes call on gods, but their techniques usually tend to focus on seeking to develop their own powers, or considering themselves to be part of god. They don’t tend to pray in the same way, although they may ask things of gods or spirits. It could almost be said that they are Left Hand Path, going by one definition of it, in the sense of being focused on self-development rather than god. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 23 Theistic Satanist beliefs about healing are based on the will of Satan and on his spark within us, although developing one’s magickal and healing powers is valued too. Setim allows you to work with Satan and develop a close relationship with him. If you are a Satanist, he is the source of the world as we see it and of the future. Setim can also work through the Black Flame, your own creative essence and connection to Satan, enlivening that spark of Satan within you. It’s very freeing and encourages creativity. You needn't be a Satanist to use the Setim symbols or experiment with the energies. But you may have more success if you've already done a dedication rite. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 24 If you feel guided to perform one, a sample dedication ritual is included at the end of this book. Don't do that unless you're ready though. Until then, Satan has given me the recipe for a potion you can take to help strengthen yourself and enhance your connection to his healing powers. Healing powers alignment potion Real coffee or energy or sports drink A splash of wine A pinch of asafoetida Plain flour, five teaspoons for every 250ml Chives, a teaspoon per 250ml Cough mixture (clears the energetic pathways for Satan) two teaspoons per 250ml Artichoke, about four teaspoons Half an apple "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 25 Spirits such as vodka, a third the amount of the final concoction, must be added to preserve it. If you’re unable to take even a small amount of any of the ingredients for genuine medical reasons, such as a diagnosed allergy, medically recommended diet or a medication which interacts with one of the ingredients, remove the ingredient you cannot use and alter the recipe according to your intuition. If in doubt, leave an ingredient out. A simpler version can be made with just the energy drink, wine, asafoetida, flour, cough mixture, and alcohol. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 26 You may puree the solid ingredients (do the solid ones first, with a little of the liquid, then add the rest of the liquid and add the flour), or boil the solid ingredients in a little water and strain out the water, adding it to the wine, or simply cut the ingredients finely and add them to the bottle. The alcohol will preserve it for a while, but keep it refrigerated. Take a small amount such as a teaspoon when you feel guided to do so . It's probably not the most delicious drink, but contains power. You can also try anointing your feet or hands with the mixture. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 27 Satan's perfection If you perform any healing, attunement or ritual, of any kind, and aren't confident you've done it perfectly, you can ask Satan and his demons to perfect what you've done. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 28 Attunements  "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 29 Before and after attunements Attunements are rituals or prayers to strengthen your healing powers and connection to Satan. There are some suggestions in this book, but you may feel guided to adapt them or perform your own. Eat a diet with more pleasurable and decadent foods (whilst following your doctor's advice) such as meat, alcohol, caffeine, cake or sweets, for a week before the attunement. This will help you adjust to the energies of the attunement, as nothing is a sin to Satan. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 30 After the attunement, whenever you feel the urge to pray in the weeks to come, pray to Satan, or say \"Hail Satan\". This will help you develop your relationship with him. There will be a week of intensive change to your spiritual energies. You may get physical and spiritual reactions and tingling and sensations of being \"freed up\" physically, spiritually and psychologically. Treat yourself with Setim, and as part of your usual diet, drink a little red wine or caffeine, or eat red meat in moderation and accordance with medical advice. Listen to the signals from your body and from Satan. If anything causes you undue discomfort or concern, consult a medical doctor in case you have become aware of something that would benefit from treatment. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 31 I suggest leaving at least one night between each of the attunements or your adaptations of them, to allow them to be processed. You may feel that you can combine some of them into one, or need to separate parts of some. Other than that, leave as long as seems right, until you are given the feeling that you are ready for your next attunement.  "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 32 An attunement to Satan and the demons If you feel guided to work with them, the demonic guides or guardian demons may guide you through life's tests and awaken your mind to Satan. Demons have their own missions but may also help you develop your Black Flame, developing your intuition, and giving you guidance. They will make it easier for Satan to flow through you, as well as helping you on this earthly plane. However you may prefer to work solely with Sa tan himself. In which case you can adapt the ritual below to refer only to Satan. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 33 With both arms out in front of you make the sign of the horns with both hands. Say \"Hail Satan. Please allow my guardian demons and demonic guides to come to me and connect with me, and please co me to me and connect with me yourself. \" Ask Satan to enfold you. Feel the different energy around you. Look with your inner eyes. Contemplate what you know of the character of Satan and the demons. Ask for His advice and aid, (if you wish, you can also ask for the aid of the demons) including asking for healing and development for yourself and your life, or making requests for your loved ones. You may perceive many things. It is up to Satan an d the demons if they choose to answer our requests and come when we ask or do otherwise, as they see fit. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 34 The healing demons can help Setim go to problem areas of the body, mind and spirit and assist, using their wisdom and the forces at their command to heal and bring health and happiness. Here is another attunement to Setim, using the demons, which will also strengthen your connection to them. It’s quite long, so you might like to record it onto a tape, or visualize part of it and then read the next bit and visualize that. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 35 The Setim arch-demonic attunement Start by breathing deeply and relaxing. Feel the ground beneath your feet and allow your awareness to extend deep into the depths of hell, connecting you to the demonic plane. See the unholy light, growing and expanding as a shaft of the brightest red light coming up from hell towards you. The energy of the Setian Star, Sopdet, pours into your head, and the two energies join at your heart. Now the archdemons begin to surround you. They form an inverted pentagram, going from below your feet to above your head. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 36 Beneath your feet is Lucifuge, at the left is Astaroth, at the right is Belial, above your head to the left is Satan, and to the right is Mammon. Now the second pentagram is formed around you. At the front left is Belphegor, at the front right is Baal . To your left is Asmoday, and to your right is Samael. Behind you is Lilith. You stand with the Archdemons sheltering you and focussing on you. Say “Hail Satan. Satan and Mammon, I ask that you connect with me and connect me with Setim, guide me in this initiation to the multiple sources of demonic blessings.” "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 37 Invite the demons to attune you. Satan, Mammon, Belial, Lucifuge, Astaroth, Asmodeus, Belphegor, Baal, Samael, Lilith. Invite your Black Flame to rise up from your heart and aid in the attunement. The demons approach and all ten of them put their hands on your head. The Black Flame flares up to burn away all obstacles to your receiving their attunement. The demons send Setim, and a deeper connection to it and the demonic energy, throughout your body. The rest surround your body, and Lilith remains with her hands on your head. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 38 She sends Setim into your head and says, \"receive acceptance of what to some is obscene and taboo. I bring Setim to help you discover the beauty of the flesh.\" Feel the energy to which she has attuned you, and the change in yourself. Astaroth puts his hands on your brow, sends Setim into it, and says; \"Receive motivation, and knowledge of the Will of Satan. Receive the ability to change yourself, others and the world in accordance with his will.” Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 39 The archdemon Belphegor puts his hands on your throat and says, \"Receive the ability to appreciate beauty without having to squabble over it. I give you the ability to get what you wish for more easily and in comfort.” See the Setim coming down from your head into your throat. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. The archdemon Samael puts his hands on your heart and sends Setim into it. He says, \"Receive certitude of your own sinlessness and fundamental innocence. I connect you with Satanic guidance in your life. May the black flame show you the way.\" See the Setim coming down from your throat into your heart. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 40 Lucifuge also puts his hands on your heart, sends Setim to it and says, \"receive a new start in Satan. I connect you with Setim and the energy of initiation and commitment to Him and his will, and your own health. Unhelpful restrictions will no longer exist for you.” Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. Relax and feel the promise of Satan pulsing with your heartbeat. The archdemon Baal places his hands on your solar plexus and sends Setim into it. He says, \"Receive strength, the ability to safeguard your health and ideals, knowing how to do so. I connect you with Setim, consecrate you with a glow of demonic blessings, so you encourage health in yourself and others.\" "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 41 See the Setim coming down from your heart into your solar plexus. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. The archdemon Belial puts his hands below your navel. He sends Setim to your abdomen and says, \"receive the support of Satan and the demons. I connect you with Setim and with the support of the demons, and the ability to fend off anything that would harm your convictions or damage you; an unholy protection and army. I bring Setim to help you find the your inner strength and remove blocks within\". See the Setim coming down from your solar plexus into your lower abdomen. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 42 Asmoday places his hands on the base of your spine, sends Setim to it and says, \"receive the fire of Satan, the devotion, passion and liberation. Be yourself and freely follow his will for you.” See the Setim coming down from your abdomen to the base of your spine. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. Mammon puts his hands on your feet and sends Setim into the feet and into the earth. He says, “I connect you with Setim and with the world. I bring you Setim as a sign from Satan, lord of this world, that you are empowered with creativity and abundance.\" See the Setim coming down from the base of your spine to your feet. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 43 Satan takes your hands and sends Setim into them. He speaks, and says, \"I am healing, receive it in your soul, heart, mind, body and every part of you. I connect you with Setim and with the healing of Set. I bring Setim to help you find the way to heal and grow, and I give you the power to heal and grow.\" See the Setim coming up from your feet to your hands. Feel the energy to which he has attuned you, and the change in yourself. Relax for a moment and become aware of your body. Feel the presence of the archdemons all around you and know that you are forever connected to them and to Setim. The archdemons place their hands on your head once more, each one giving you a demonic blessing, sealing your connection. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 44 As they start to remove their hands from your head, their hands lifting up draws your Black Flame up in your heart. You find yourself chanting “Nema, nema, nema, nema, nema,” and pledging again inwardly your commitment to the path.  "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 45 Attunement to empower the hands In this attunement you will increase the energy in your heart centre, and activate your fingers and palms. Ask Satan to come into your heart, and feel his presence. While sitting and holding your palms facing up as if to receive a gift, make the sign of the horns. You will see that your two middle fingers point into the middle of your palm, so the energy flows into the whole of the palm and fingers, and then is focused back to aim at the centre of the palm more fully and develop it. Ask Satan to activate your fingers and palms to enable you to use them for healing. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 46 The third attunement, affirmations and prayer Intend to connect to the Black Flame and Satan. Call up on them to aid you in doing so. I realize some of you will have been Satanists for some time and accomplished great work and transformation. Now give yourself to Satan and the Black Flame even more fully, with no limits. When you pray, use the affirmation \"Hail Satan\" repeatedly. I've been told you'll also get some results with \"I am a goat.\" We may not be physically goats, but what the affirmation means is we are free spirits and do not serve Jesus like sheep. You are Satan's chosen. This affirmation delivers self- sufficiency and lightheartedness. Try \"I am one with the Black Flame,\" Or \"The will of Satan is my Will.\" You"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 47 can also make the sign of the horns when praying or using affirmations. Feel how the energies within you alter when you say or think these statements or others of your own design. Satan is simple! There need not be anything difficult, overly intellectual or obscure about him. When praying, you could try sensing the Black Flame within, your desire to connect to Satan, and feel Satan around you. Or simply pray to him as you would any god. You may begin to feel that other things and events in your life and the world are immanations of Satan. For instance I feel he gifts me with abundance, so I come across things I would like for bargain prices. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 48 Fourth attunement- Opening the energy body to Satan In this exercise you will again ask for the grace of Satan. Make the sign of the horns with your left hand and place the knuckles, still in the gesture, against the third eye. Do the same with the right hand, but at the back of the head. (This is a bit uncomfortable, symbolizing the discomfort of excessive mental and physical restriction, which is now behind you.) Say \"I ask dear Satan to come to me\" and see and feel his energy above your head. Now draw it down to your heart. Imagine it opening your body, then take it to your third eye. You will feel the emotional joy within that is the outpouring of Satan, or other emotions and sensations. Now sit comfortably with your palms up. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 49 Say \"Satan, I call you to myself. Please join with me, enter me.\" Feel the freeing action of Satan within. Visualize and contemplate him permeating you with the colours black and red, and altering your energy body to help your development and increase your healing powers. Red represents assertiveness, the material world, and hell, the home of Satan and his followers who have passed away. Black represents knowledge, and knowledge of Satan. Wisdom, self- knowledge and dedication to what you desire. It also represents acceptance of reality. Perform any other actions that seem necessary to complete the attunement. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 50 Attunement to the Setim symbols via movement You may wish to use symbols to channel healing, but there's no obligation to use them. Do what your intuition tells you. If and when you feel inspired to, you can learn more about Satanic symbols later in this book. Any symbols you feel drawn to can be used. Use the symbols with your mind or hands. One thing you can try is to move your body in these shapes associated with Satan- the sign for brimstone, inverted cross, inverted pentagram, or the seal of Lucifer, which you can draw with both hands. Call on Setim, Satan and the Black Flame to make changes to you while you do this. Perhaps make a workout with these movements. This is an attunement in itself. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 51 Via visualization This meditation is to promote understanding of the symbols, and attune you to them if you wish. If you feel the need, have the symbols on a piece of paper next to you, to help you visualize them. Drawings of the symbols are included in the section ‘Individual uses of the symbols.’ Imagine the 666 symbol as a disc far above your head. Now imagine it twirling and twirling down towards your body, as slowly as needed. It spins in a vibrant red. As it enters your body it leaves the Heart of the Antichrist symbol above your head in your aura, making you more aware of Satan's plan for you and this world. It passes through your eyes, leaving the eye in the triangle behind. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 52 Then it spins to your throat, leaving a copy of the brimstone symbol to stimulate the energy you receive from your thyroid gland. (If you have any problems with your thyroid, this will only effect them in a positive way, balancing them, or if you have had them removed, it wi ll give you a boost of health without effecting any condition negatively, as it works with the spiritual body). Then it spins to your heart, leaving the seal of Lucifer for dedication. It spins then through your body to your lower rib cage, your liver and kidneys, and leaves a lightening bolt to help you remove negative beliefs. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 53 At your abdomen it leaves an inverted pentagram, to centre you. Continuing to spin in a red glow, it leaves the inverted cross at your pelvis, with the horizontal line going from one side of the pelvis to the other, and the base on the groin. Here it removes anything that may impair your freedom in a negative way. Then the glow spreads out to spin over your hands, leaving pitchforks to enhance your connection to Satan and your healing abilities. Form them into the sign of the horns. Spinning down your le gs, at your ankles it leaves the serpent, which climbs your whole body like a tree, leaving balance and calm. Finally the spinning glow goes below your feet to leave the Heart of hell symbol, making you more aware of the demons and other kindred spirits, human and spiritual. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 54 The symbol becomes outlined in black and then transforms into a black flame, which flares up, surrounds your whole aura, then concentrates itself to rest deep in your heart with the seal of Lucifer. Black and red, used in the attunement, are the customary colours associated with Satan, and endow you with his healing life and strength.

You can also make an organ essence with the effect of normalizing an organ, or an essence intended to heal a disease. You may feel guided to dilute the substance containing an essence before taking it. Use whatever dosage you feel is right.

You can test the energy of the symbols by making them out of cardboard, or with strings, or drawing them with chalk, and standing on them. Even these simple tests can produce surprising responses and insights. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 131 To create the nets, you can use stones painted with the symbols. There's no need to use crystals as New Agers do unless you feel drawn to use them. They're not native to us, not economical, and the mining of them is said to not be environmentally friendly (the economic cost motivates me far more, personally.) You can paint the symbols on the stones using nail polish, or enamel paint. Send the symbols to the stones with your hands before painting. You may like to place a drop of blood on them (I suggest using a diabetic lancet for pain and damage-free blood offerings) to charge them if you wish. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 132 If you find that stones of a shape and size you are happy with difficult to obtain, you can alternatively make 'stones'/talismans using salt dough.  "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 133 Salt dough recipe You will need:- 2 cups flour, 1 cup salt, 1 cup water, a teaspoon of vegetable oil. Mix the dough and mold your shapes. Leave to dry naturally for 48 hours, oven bake at 180F for 4 hours, or microwave for about sixteen minutes, eight on each side. Other recipes say less time, although that's how long they took for me, so keep a close eye on them. This is sufficient dough for eight 'stones.' If you make the stones smaller or thinner, they will need less time.

The function of a symbol’s net is much the same as the function of the symbol itself, but a deeper and more focused method. I summarize them here for ease of reference. Numerous other nets can be devised, by combining the stones as you see fit. Brimstone - The brimstone net is for developing the strength to carry on or to overcome difficult situations, increasing physical energy levels, or to help you make the changes a situation has been sent to you by Satan to assist you in making.

Puts any different parts of the self in a healthy arrangement and proportion for happiness and adaptability. Can be used to energize a food or goal, or increase the power of a healing. Physical healing. Seal of Lucifer - Protection. Realizing the good you already have, your worth, and gaining positive insights from what you have experienced. For those who have done a dedication, it represents certainty, dedication, discipline, and links you to Satan. Black flame - Burns away obstacles, makes you feel loved, special, and gives direction to your spirituality. Heart of the Antichrist -Helps you see the ultimate future and plan for the universe, increases your awareness of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 136 Satan's plan. Heart of hell - heart of hell connects us to the depths of hell, the people there, and the demons there and around us, giving you a sense of kinship to the universe. Eye in the Triangle - Helps you see the realities of a situation and know how to deal with them, Pitchfork/ 666 - spiritual healing, attunement, Brings spiritual helpers, guardians and demons, greater connection to Satan. Lightning bolt - The lightning bolt net is to remove barriers to moving on, to attunements, and to encourage new beliefs and freedom. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 137 Using the nets Eat decadent food such as chocolate, drink coffee, wine or other alcoholic or caffeinated beverages before, during or after using a symbol net. If you are prone to such things, you may find you have visions if you are in a net. Have a notebook handy to record your thoughts and impressions if you find that helpful or enjoyable, or just relax. You can also place a net for healing, freedom from insomnia or other purposes in your bedroom, around your bed, and sleep in it. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 138 To create a particular net, place all the stones around you, in whatever places seem right to you. I suggest putting the stone representing the symbol whose net you wish to use behind your head, on your heart or some other part of your body, to make it the focus. The other ones you may spread about as you wish. You can also make a net with the intent of two symbols combined, such as brimstone and lightening bolt both placed on the body, with the other stones around you, to break a habit. The only limit to the possible purposes for the nets is your imagination. "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Little Book of Satanic Healing 139 Absent healing with nets To heal someone from a distance using a net, use a link to the person such as a lock of their hair, other bodily item, or something hand-written by them, and place it in the net. You can also try making a sketch of the body, and writing the person's full name, and placing it in the net. You could experiment by putting yourself in a net absently by using this method, perhaps placing the net in a drawer.

Attune your home and any objects in it you wish to protect, or everything you own if you feel guided to do so. Perhaps bury a copy of a Setim symbol in an area y ou wish to attune.

To send Setim to the world, you can use a golden globe on which you have stuck an inverted cross, representing Satan's rulership of the earth and the dominance of his will over worldly events.

Send Setim to those organizations or people who seek to thwart his will, such as fundamentalist groups. To such groups, the Satanic symbols would be anathema, but every spirit seeks healing.

The basis of Satanism is assertiveness and common sense. Choose a course of action based on whether it will bring about your will and Satan's will more than another course. Violence, fo r instance, is not usually worth ending up in prison, so use it only if you genuinely think a court will see it as self-defence, or if you think the situation calls for it to the extent that the act would be worth losing your freedom for. Assertiveness, on the other hand, often has the possibility of being worth it. It stops you staying with people you don't want to spend your time with, and putting up with treatment you shouldn't take.

If you fear for your physical safety or a person has been violent to you, it may not be wise to confront them, and might be better simply to leave.

This would have to be altered slightly for the Theistic Satanist, as we worship rather than use or command Satan. Satan himself promises in the bible that all the world can be Jesus', if he will fall down and worship him. Unlike the LaVeyan idea that Satan would not want us to fall down or worship him, this episode shows that Satan wishes us to bow down in order for a pact to be fully forged, in my opinion, and that this could be useful to have as part of th e rite.
