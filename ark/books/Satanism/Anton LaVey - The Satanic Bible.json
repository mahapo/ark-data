Wolfe On a winter's evening in 1967 , I drove c rosstown in San Fransisco to hear Anton Szandor LaVey lecture a t an open meeting of the Sexual Freedom League. I was attracted by newspaper articles describing him as \"the Black Pope\" of a Satanic c hurch in which b aptism, wedding, and funeral ceremonies were dedicated to the Devil. I was a free-lance magazine writer, and I felt there might be a story in LaVey and his contemporary pagans; for the Devil has always made \"goo d copy\", as they say on the city desk. It was not the practice of the black arts itself that I considered to be the story, beca use that is nothing new in the world. There were Devil-worshipping sects and voo doo cults before there were Christians. In eighteenth-century England a Hell-Fire Club, with connections to the American colonies through Benjamin Franklin, gained some brief notoriety. During the ea rly part of the twentieth century, the press publicized Aleister Crowley as the \"wickedest man in the world\". And there were hints in the 1920s and '30s of a \"black order\" in Germany. To this s eemingly old story LaVey and his organization of contemporary Faustians offered two strikingly new chapters. First, they blasphemously represented themselves as a \"church\", a term previously confined to the branches of Christianity, instead of the traditional coven of Satanism and witchcraft lore. Second, they practiced their black magic openly instead of underground. Rather than arrange a prelimi nary interview w ith LaVey for discussion of his heretical innovations, my usual first step in research, I decided to watch and listen to him as an unidentified member of an audience. He was described in some newspapers as a former circus and carnival lion tamer and trickster now representing himself as the Devil's representative on earth, and I wanted to determine first whether he was a true Satanist, a prankster, or a quack. I had already met people in the lim elight of the occult business; in fact, Jeane Dixon was my landlady and I had a chance to write a bout her before Ruth Montgomery did. But I had considered all the occultists phonies, hypocrites, or quacks, and I would never spend five minutes writing about their various forms of hocus-pocus. All the occultists I had met or heard of were white-lighters: alleged seers, prophesiers, and witches wrapping their supp osedly mystic powers around God-based, spiritual comm unication. LaVey, seeming to laugh at them i f not spit on them i n contempt, emerged from between the lines of newspaper stories as a black magician b asing his work on the dark side of nature a nd the ca rnal side of humanity. There seemed to be nothing spiritual about his \"church\". As I listened to LaVey talk that first time, I r ealized at once there was nothing to connect him with the occult business. He c ould not even b e described as metaphysical. The brutally frank talk he delivered was pragmatic, relativistic, and above a ll rational. It was unorthodox, to be sure: a blast at established religious worship, repression of humanity's carnal nature, phony pretense a t piety in the c ourse of an existence based on dog-eat-dog material pursuits. It was also full of sardonic satire on h uman folly. But most important of all, the talk was logical. It was not quack magic that LaVey offered his audience. It was comm on sense philosophy based on the realities of life. After I beca me c onvinced of LaVey's s incerity, I had to convince him that I intended to do some serious research instead of adding to the acc umulation of hack articles dealing with the Church of Satan as a new type of freak show. I boned up on Satanism, discussed its history and rationale with LaVey, and attended some midnight rituals in the famous Victorian manse once used as Church of Satan h eadqu arters. Out of all that I produced a serious article, only to find that was not what the publishers of \"respectable\" magazines wanted. They were interested in only the freak show kind of article. Finally, it was a so-called \"girlie\" or \"man's\" magazine, Knight of September"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 1968 , that published the first definitive a rticle on LaVey, the Church of Satan, and LaVey's synthesis of the old Devil legends and black magic lore into the modern philosophy and p ractice of Satanism that all followers and imitators now use as their model, their guide, and even their Bible. My magazine a rticle was the beginning, not t he e nd (as it has been with my other writing subjects), of a long and intimate a ssociation. Out of it came my biography of LaVey, The Devil's Avenger, pu blished by Pryamid in 1974 . After the boo k was published, I beca me a ca rd-carrying member and, subsequently, a priest of the Church of Satan, a title I now proudly share with many celebrated p ersons. The postmidnight philosophical discussions I began with LaVey in 1967 continue today, a deca de later, supp lemented sometimes these days by a nifty witch or some of our own music, him on organ and me on drums, in a bizarre ca baret populated by superrealistic humanoids of LaVey's creation. All of LaVey's background seemed to prepare him for his role. He is the descendant of Georgian, Roumanian, and Alsatian grandparents, including a gypsy grandmother who passed on to him the legends of vampires and witches in h er native Transylvania. As early as the a ge of five, LaVey was reading Weird-Tales magazines and boo ks s uch as M ary Shelly's Frankenstein and Bram Stoker's Dracula . Though h e was different from other children, they appointed him as leader in marches and maneuvers in mock military orders. In 1942 , when LaVey was twelve, his fascination with toy soldiers led to concern over World War II. He delved into mili tary manuals and d iscovered arsenals for the e quipment of armies and navies could be bought like groceries in a supermarket and u sed to conquer nations. The idea too k shape in h is head that contrary to what the Christian Bible said, the ea rth would not be inhereted by the meek, but by the mighty. In h igh schoo l LaVey beca me something of an offbeat child p rodigy. Reserving his most serious studies for outside the schoo l, he delved into music, metaphysics, and secrets of the occult. At fifteen, he beca me second oboist in the San Fransisco Ballet Symphony Orchestra. Bored with high schoo l classes, LaVey dropped out in h is J unior year, left home, and joined the Clyde Beatty Circus as a ca ge boy, watering and feeding the lions and tigers. Animal trainer Beatty noticed that LaVey was comfortable working with the big cats and made him an assistant trainer. Possessed since c hildhoo d by a passion for the a rts, for culture, LaVey was not content merely with the e xcitement of training jungle beasts and working with them i n the ring as a fill-in for Beatty. By age ten h e had taught himself to play the piano by ear. This came in h andy when the circus calliope player beca me drunk before a performance a nd was unable to go o n; LaVey volunteered to replace him, confident he c ould handle the unfamili ar organ keyboard well enough to provide the nece ssary background music. It turned out he knew more music a nd p layed better than the regular calliopist, so Beatty cashiered the drunk and installed LaVey at the instrument. He acc ompanied the \"Human Cannonball\", Hugo Zachinni, and the Wallendas' h igh-wire ac ts, among others. When LaVey was eighteen h e left the c ircus and joined a ca rnival. There he beca me a ssistant to a magician, learned hypnosis, and studied more a bout the occult. It was a c urious combination. On the one side he was working in an atmosphere of life a t its rawest level - of earthy music; the smell of wild animals and sawdust; acts in which a second of missed timi ng meant acc ident or death; performances that demanded youth and strength, and shed those who grew old like last year's clothes; a world of physical excitement that had magical attractions. On the other side, he was working with magic in the dark side of the human b rain. Perhaps the strange c ombination influenced the way he began to view humanity as he played organ for carnival sideshows. \"On Saturday night,\" LaVey reca lled in one of our long talks, \"I would see men lusting after half- naked g irls dancing at the ca rnival, and on Sunday morning when I was playing organ for tent- show evaneglists at the other end of the ca rnival lot, I would see these same men sitting in the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 pews with their wives and children, asking God to forgive them and pu rge them of carnal desires. And the next Saturday night they'd be back at the ca rnival or some other place of indulgence. I knew then that the Christian church thrives on h ypocrisy, and that man's carnal nature will out no matter how much it is purged or scourged by any white-light religion.\" Though LaVey did not realize it then, he was on h is way toward formulating a religion that would serve a s the a ntithesis of Christianity and its J udaic heritage. It was an old religion, older than Christianity or Judaism. But it had never been formalized, arranged into a body of thought and ritual. That was to become LaVey's role in twentieth-century civilization. After LaVey beca me a married man h imself in 1951 , at age twenty-one, he a bandoned the wondrous world of the ca rnival to settle into a ca reer better suited for homemaking. He had been enrolled as a c rimi nology major at t he City College of San Fransisco. That led to his first conformist job, photographer for the San Fransisco Police Department. As it worked out, that job had as much to do as any other with his development of Satanism as a way of life. \"I saw the bloo diest, grimi est side of human n ature,\" LaVey recounted in a session dealing with his past life. \"People shot by nuts, knifed by their friends; little kids s plattered in the gutter by hit- and-run drivers. It was disgusting and d epressing. I asked myself: 'Where is God?' I came to detest the sanctimonious attitude of people toward violence, always saying 'it's God's will'.\" So he quit in disgust after three years of being a c rime photographer and returned to playing organ, this time in n ightclubs and theaters to earn a living while he c ontinued his s tudies into his life's passion: the black arts. Once a week he held classes on arcane topics: hauntings, E.S.P., dreams, vampires, werewolves, divination, ceremonial m agic, etc. They attracted many people who were, or have since become, well known in the a rts and sciences, and the business world. Eventually a \"Magic Circle\" evolved from this group. The major purpose of the Circle was to meet for the performance of magical rituals LaVey had discovered or devised. He had acc umulated a library of works that descibed the Black Mass and other infamous ceremonies conducted by groups s uch as the Knights Templar in fourteenth- century France, the Hell-Fire c lub and the Golden Dawn in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. The intent of some of these secret orders was to blaspheme, lampoo n the Christian church, and address themselves to the Devil as an anthropomorphic deity that represented the reverse of God. In LaVey's view, the Devil was not that, but rather a dark, hidden force in n ature responsible for the workings of earthly affairs, a force for which n either science nor r eligion h ad any explanation. LaVey's Satan is \"the spirit of progress, the inspirer of all great movements that contribute to the development of civilization and the a dvancement of mankind. He is the spirit of revolt that leads to freedom, the embodiment of all heresies that liberate.\" On the last night of April 1966 - Walpurgisnacht, the most important festival in the lore of magic and witchcraft - LaVey ritualistically shaved his head in acc ordance with magical tradition and announced the formation of the Church of Satan. For proper identification as its minister, he put on the c lerical collar. Up to that collar he loo ked almost holy. But his Genghis Khan-like shaven head, his M ephistophelian b eard, and his narrow eyes gave him the nece ssary demonic loo k for his priesthood of the Devil's church on earth. \"For one thing,\" LaVey explained himself, \"calling it a c hurch enabled me to follow the magic formula of one part outrage to nine parts s ocial respectability that is needed for succe ss. But the main purpose was to gather a group of like-minded individuals together for the use of their combined energies in calling up the dark force in nature that is called Satan.\" As LaVey pointed out, all other churches are based on worship of the spirit and d enial of the flesh and the intellect. He saw the need for a c hurch that would reca pture man's mind and carnal desires as objects of celebration. Rational self-interest would be e ncouraged and a healthy ego championed."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 He began to realize that t he old concept of a Black Mass to satirize Christian services was outmoded or, as he put it, \"beating a dead horse\". In the Church of Satan, LaVey initiated some exhilarating p sychodramas, in lieu of Christianity's s elf-debasing services, thereby exorcising repressions and inhibitations fostered by white-light religions. There was a revolution in the Christian church itself against orthodox rites and traditions. It had become popular to declare that \"God is dead\". So, the a lternative rites that LaVey worked out, while still m aintaining some of the trappings of ancient ceremonies, were c hanged from a negative mockery to positive forms of celebrations and pu rges: Satanic weddings consecrating the joys of the flesh, funerals devoid of sanctimonious platitudes, lust rituals to help individuals attain their sex desires, destruction rituals to enable members of the Satanic church to triumph over enemies. On special occa sions s uch as baptisms, weddings, and funerals in the name of the Devil, press coverage, though unsolicited, was phenominal. By 1967 the newspapers that were sending reporters to write a bout the Church of Satan extended from San Fransisco across the Pacific to Tokyo and across the Atlantic to Paris. A photo o f a nude woman, half covered by a leopard skin, serving as an altar to Satan in a LaVey-conceived wedding ceremony, was transmitted by major wire services to daily newspapers everywhere: and it showed up on the front page of such bulwarks of the media a s the Los Angeles Times . As the result of the publicity, grottos (LaVey's counterpart to covens) affiliated with the Church of Satan spread throughout the world, proving one of LaVey's cardinal messages: the Devil is alive and highly popular with a great many people. Of course LaVey pointed out to anyone who would listen that the Devil to him and his followers was not the stereotyped fellow cloaked in red g arb, with h orns, tail and p itchfork, but rather the dark forces in n ature that human b eings are just beginning to fathom. How did LaVey square that explanation with h is own appearance a t times in b lack cowl with h orns? He replied: \"People need ritual, with symbols s uch as those you find in b aseball games or church services or wars, as vehicles for expending emotions they can't release or even understand on their own.\" Nevertheless, LaVey himself soon tired of the games. There were setbacks. First, some of LaVey's neighbors began complaining about the full-growm lion h e was keeping as a house pet, and eventually the big cat was donated to the local zoo . Next, one of LaVey's most devoted witches, Jayne Mansfield, died u nder a c urse he had p lace d on the head of her suitor, lawyer Sam Brody, for a variety of reasons I have e xplained in The Devil's Avenger; LaVey had p ersistently warned her away from Brody and felt depressed over her death. It was the second tragic death in the sixties of a Hollywoo d sex symbol with whom he had been intimately involved; the other was M arilyn Monroe, LaVey's paramour for a brief but crucial period in 1948 when h e had qu it the ca rnival and was playing organ for strippers around the Los Angeles area. On top of all that, LaVey was tired of organizing entertainments and pu rges for his church members. He had g otten in touch with the last living remnants of the prewar occult fraternities of Europe, was busily acquiring their philosophies and secret rituals left over from the pre-Hitler era, and needed time to study, write a nd work out new principles. He had long been experimenting with and applying the principles of geometric spacial concepts in what he terms \"The Law of the Trapezoid\". (He scoffs at current faddists who are \"barking up the wrong p yramids\".) He was also becoming widely sought as s peaker, guest on radio and television programs, and p roduction and/or technical adviser to scores of television producers and moviemakers turning out Satanic chillers. Sometimes he was also an actor. As s ociologist Clinton R. Sanders points out: \"...no occultist has had as direct an impact upon formulaic c inematic presentations of Satanism as has Anton Szandor LaVey. Ritual and esoteric symbolism are ce ntral elements in LaVey's church and the film s in which h e has had a hand contain detailed p ortrayals of Satanic rites and are filled with traditional occult symbols. The e mphasis upon ritual in the Church of Satan is 'intended to focus"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 the e motional powers within eac h individual'. Simil arly, the ornate ritualism that is central to LaVey's film s may reasonably be seen as a mechanism to involve a nd focus the e motional experience of the cinema audience.\" At last LaVey decided to transfer rituals and other organized activities to Church of Satan grottos around the world, and d evote himself to writing, lecturing, teac hing - and to his famil y: wife Diane, the blonde beauty who serves as High Priestess of the Church; raven-haired d aughter Karla, now in h er early twenties, a c rimi nology major like her father before, spending much of her time lecturing on Satanism at universities in many parts of the c ountry; and finally Zeena, remembered by people who saw the famous photo o f the Satanic Church b aptism as a tiny tot, but now a gorgeously developed teenager attracting a growing pack of wolves, human male variety. Out of LaVey's relatively quiescent period came his widely read, pioneering boo ks: First, The Satanic Bible, which at t his writing is in its twelfth edition (and this is my second, revised introduction, after having written the original introduction to the first edition). Second, The Satanic Rituals, which covers more of the somber, complex material LaVey unearthed from his increasing sources. And third, The Compleat Witch, a bestseller in Italy, but, sadly, allowed by its American publisher to go out of print with its potential unfulfilled. LaVey's s preading out from organized church activities to writing boo ks for worldwide distribution h as, of course, greatly expanded Church of Satan membership. Satanism's growing popularity has naturally been acc ompanied by scare stories from religious groups complaining that The Satanic Bible now outsells the Christian Bible on college ca mpuses and is a leading causative factor in youngsters' turning away from God. And certainly one suspects that Pope Paul had LaVey in mind when h e issued his worldwide proclamation two years ago that the Devil is \"alive\" and \"a person\", a living, fire-breathing character spreading evil over the ea rth. LaVey, maintaining that \"evil\" is \"live\" spelled backward and should be indulged in and enjoyed, answers the pope a nd the religious scare groups this way: \"People, organizations, nations are making milli ons of dollars off us. What would they do without us? W ithout the Church of Satan, they wouldn't have a nybody to rage a t and to take the blame for all the rotten things happening in the world. If they really feel this way, they shouldn't have blown us out of proportion. What you really have to believe instead is that they are the c harlatans, and they're really glad to have us around so they can exploit us. We're a n extremely valuable comm odity. We've helped business, lifted up the ec onomy, and some of the milli ons of dollars we have generated have in turn flowed into the Christian church. We have proved many times over the Ninth Satanic Statement that says the c hurch - and countless individuals - cannot exist without the Devil.\" For that the Christian church must pay a price. The e vents that LaVey predicted in the first edition of The Satanic Bible have c ome to pass. Repressed p eople have burst t heir bonds. Sex h as exploded, the c ollective libido has been released, in movies and literature, on the streets, and in the home. People a re dancing topless and bottomless. Nuns have throwm off their traditional habits, exposed their legs, and d anced the \"Missa Solemnis Rock\" that LaVey thought he was conjuring up as a prank. There is a cea seless universal quest for entertainment, gourmet foo ds and wines, adventure, enjoyment of the here a nd now. Humanity is no longer willing to wait for any afterlife that promises to reward the c lean, pure - translate: ascetic, drab - spirit. There is a moo d of neopaganism and hedonism, and from i t t here have e merged a wide variety of brilliant individuals - doctors, lawyers, engineers, teac hers, writers, stockbrokers, real estate developers, actors and actresses, mass comm unications media people (to cite a few categories of Satanists) - who are interested in formalizing and perpetuating this all-pervading religion and way of life. It is not an easy religion to adopt in a society ruled so long by Puritan ethics. There is no false altruism or mandatory love-thy-neighbor concept in this religion. Satanism i s a blatantly selfish,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 brutal philosophy. It is based on the belief that human b eings are inherently selfish, violent creatures, that life is a Darwinian strugg le for survival of the fittest, that only the strong survive and the ea rth will be ruled by those who fight to win the cea seless competition that exists in all jungles - including those of urbanized society. Abhor this brutal outloo k if you will; it is based, as it has been for centuries, on real conditions that exist in the world we inhabit rather than the mystical lands of milk and honey depicted in the Christian Bible. In The Satanic Bible, Anton LaVey has explained the philosophy of Satanism m ore profoundly than any of his ancestors in the Kingdom of Darkness, while describing in detail the innovative rituals and trappings he has devised to create a c hurch of realists. It has been clear from the first edition that many people want to read this boo k to learn h ow to start Satanic groups and ritualize black magic. The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals are the only boo ks that have demonstrated, in a way that is authentic a nd true to relevant traditions, how all of that can b e done. There have been many imi tators, never attributing their source, and with goo d reason; beca use once the shabbiness and shallowness of the imi tators have been compared to LaVey's pioneering work, there can no longer be any market for the ripoff artists. The e vidence is clear to any who are willing to view the record: Anton LaVey brought Satan out of the c loset and the Church of Satan is the fountainhead of contemporary Satanism. This boo k summ arizes the message both convey, and remains both challenge a nd inspiration, as timely today as when it was written.

The c oncept of \"God\", as interpreted by man, has been so varied throughout the a ges, that t he Satanist simply acce pts the definition which suits him best. Man h as always created his gods, rather than h is gods creating him . God is, to some, benign - to o thers, terrifying. To the Satanist \"God\" - by whatever name he is called, or by no name a t all - is s een as the balancing factor in n ature, and not as being concerned with suffering. This powerful force which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care a bout the happiness or misery of flesh-and-bloo d creatures on this ball of dirt upon which we live. Anyone who thinks of Satan as evil should consider all the men, women, children, and animals who have died beca use it was \"God's will\". Certainly a person grieving the untimely loss of a loved one whould much rather have their loved one with them than in God's hands! Instead, they are unctuously consoled by their clergyman who says, \"It was God's will, my dear\"; or \"He is in God's hands now, my son.\" Such phrases have been a c onvenient way for religionists to condone or excuse the mercilessness of God. But if God is in complete c ontrol and as benign as he is supp osed to be, why does He a llow these things to happen? Too long have religionists been falling back on their bibles and rulebooks to prove or disprove, justify, condemn, or interpret. The Satanist realizes that man, and the ac tion and reac tion of the universe, is responsible for everything, and d oesn't mislead himself into thinking that someone ca res. No longer will we sit back and acce pt \"fate\" without doing anything about it, just beca use it says s o in Chapter such and such, Psalm so and so - and that's that! The Satanist knows that praying d oes absolutely no goo d - in fact, it actually lessens the c hance of succe ss, for the devoutly religious too o ften sit back complace ntly and p ray for a situation which, if they were to do something about it on their own, could be accomplished much quicker! The Satanist shuns terms s uch as \"hope\" and \"prayer\" as they are indicative of apprehension. If we hope a nd p ray for something to come a bout, we will not act in a positive way which will make it happen. The Satanist, realizing that anything he gets is of his own doing, takes comm and of the situation instead of praying to God for it to happen. Positive thinking and p ositive action add up to results. Just as the Satanist does not pray to God for assistance, he does not pray for forgiveness for his wrong d oings. In other r eligions, when one c ommi ts a wrong he e ither prays to God for forgiveness, or confesses to an intermediary and asks him to pray to God for forgiveness for his sins. The Satanist knows that praying d oes no goo d, confessing to another human b eing, like himself, accomplishes even less - and is, furthermore, degrading. When a Satanist commi ts a wrong, he realizes that it is natural to make a mistake - and if he is truly sorry about what he has done, he will l earn from i t and take ca re not to do the same thing again. If he is not honestly sorry about what he has done, and k nows he will do the same thing over and over, he has no business confessing and asking forgiveness in the first place . But this is exactly what happens. People c onfess their sins s o that they can clear their consciences - and be free to go out and sin again, usually the same sin."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 There a re many diferent interpretations of God, in the usual sense of the word, as there a re types of people. The images run from a belief in a god who is s ome vague sort of \"universal cosmic mind\" to an anthropomorphic deity with a long white beard and sandals who keeps track of every action of each individual. Even within the c onfines of a given religion, the personal interpretations of God d iffer greatly. Some religions actually go so far as to label anyone who belongs to a religious s ect other than their own a heretic, even though the overall doctrines and impressions of godliness are nearly the same. For example: The Catholics believe that the Protestants are doo med to Hell simply beca use they do not belong to the Catholic Church. In the same way, many splinter groups of the Christian faith, such as the e vangelical or r evivalist churches, believe that the Catholics are heathens who worship g raven images. (Christ is depicted in the image that is most psychologically akin to the individual worshipping him, and yet the Chrisitans criticize \"heathens\" for the worship of graven images.) And the Jews have always been given the Devil's name. Even though the god in all of these religions is basically the same, eac h regards the way chosen b y the others as reprehensible, and to top it all, religionists actually PRAY for one a nother! They have scorn for the brothers of the right-hand p ath b eca use their r eligions carry different labels, and somehow this animosity must be released. What better way than through \"prayer\"! What a simperingly polite way of saying: \"I hate your guts,\" is the thinly disguised d evice known as praying for your enemy! Praying for one's own enemy is nothing more than b argain-basement anger, and of a decidedly shoddy and inferior quality! If there has been so much v iolent discrepancy as to the proper way in which to worship God, how many different interpretations of God can there be - and who is right? All devout \"white-lighters\" are c oncerned with pleasing God so that they might have the \"Pearly Gates\" opened for them when they die. Nevertheless, if a man h as not lived his life in acc ordance with the regulations of his faith, he can at the last minute ca ll a c lergyman to his deathbed for a final absolution. The priest or minister will then come running on the double, to \"make e verything right\" with God and see to it that his passport to the Heavenly Realm i s in order. (The Yezidis, a sect of Devil worshippers, take a different viewpoint. They believe that God is all-powerful, but also all-forgiving, and so acc ordingly feel that it is the Devil whom they must please, as he is the one who rules their lives while here on earth. They believe so strongly that God will forgive a ll of their sins once they have been given the last rites, that they feel no need to concern themselves with the opinion God may hold of them while they live.) With all of the c ontradictions in the Christian scriptures, many people c urrently cannot rationally acce pt Christianity the way it has been practiced in the past. Great numbers of people a re beginning to doubt the e xistence of God, in the e stablished Christian sense of the word. So, they have taken to calling themselves \"Christian Atheists\". True, the Christian Bible is a mass of contradictions; but what could be more contradictory than the term \"Christian Atheist\"? If prominent leaders of the Christian faith are rejecting the past interpretations of God, how then can their followers be expected to adhere to previous religious tradition?

Satanism advocates indulging in eac h of these \"sins\" as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. A Satanist knows there is nothing wrong with b eing g reedy, as it only means that he wants more than h e a lready has. Envy means to loo k with favor upon the possessions of others, and to be desirous of obtaining simil ar things for oneself. Envy and g reed are the motivating forces of ambition - and without ambition, very little of any importance would be accomplished. Gluttony is s imply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive. When you have overeaten to the point of obesity, another sin - pride - will m otivate you to regain an appearance that will renew your self-respect. Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering his body and p rotecting it from the e lements is guilty of pride. Satanists often encounter scoffers who maintain that labels are not nece ssary. It must be pointed out to these destroyers of labels that one or many articles they themselves are wearing are not wearing are not nece ssary to keep them warm. There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of ornamentation. The Satanist points out that any ornamentation of the scoffer's body shows that he, too , is guilty of pride. Regardless of how verbose the c ynic may be in h is intellectual description of how free he is, he is s till wearing the elements of pride. Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth, and if you lie in b ed long enough you may find yourself commi ting yet another sin - lust. To have the faintest stirring of sexual desire is to be guilty of lust. In order to insure the propagation of humanity, nature made lust the second most powerful instinct, the first being self-preservation. Realizing this, the Christian Church made fornication the \"Original Sin\". In this way they made sure no o ne would escape sin. Your very state of being is as a result of sin - the Original sin! The strongest instinct in every living thing is s elf-preservation, which b rings us to the last of the seven deadly sins - anger. Is it not our instinct for self-preservation that is aroused when someone harms us, when we become a ngry enough to protect ourselves from further attack? A Satanist practices the motto, \"If a man smite thee on one c heek, smash him on the other!\" Let no wrong go unredressed. Be as a lion in the path - be dangerous even in defeat! Since man's natural instincts lead him to sin, all m en are sinners; and all sinners go to hell. If everyone goes to hell, then you will m eet all your friends there. Heaven must be populated with some rather strange c reatures if all they lived for was to go to a place where they can strum harps for eternity. \"Times have c hanged. Religious leaders no longer preac h that all our natural actions are sinful. We no longer think sex is dirty - or that taking p ride in ourselves is s hameful - or that wanting something someone e lse has is vicious.\" Of course not, times have c hanged! \"If you want proo f of this, just loo k at how liberal churches have become. Why, they're practicing all the things that you preach.\" Satanists hear these, and simil ar statements, all the time; and they agree wholeheartedly.

Certainly it would be far less hypocritical. In rece nt years there has been an attempt to humanize the spiritual concept of Christianity. This has manifested itself in the most obvious non-spiritual m eans. Masses which h ad been said in Latin are now said in n ative languages - which only succee ds in making the nonsense ea sier to understand, and at the same time robs the ce remony of the e soteric nature which is consistent with the tenets of the dogma. It is much simpler to o btain an emotional reac tion using words and phrases that cannot be understoo d than it is with statements which even the simplest mind will question when hearing them in an understandable language. If priests and ministers were to have used the devices to fill their churches one hundred years ago that t hey use today, they would have been charged with h eresy, called d evils, oft-times persecuted, but certainly excommunicated without hesitation. The religionists wail, \"We must keep up with the times,\" forgetting that, due to limi ting factors and d eeply engrained laws of white light religions, there ca n neve r be sufficient change to meet the needs of man. Past religions have a lways represented the spiritual nature of man, with little or no concern for his carnal or mundane needs. They have c onsidered this life but transitory, and the flesh merely a shell; physical pleasure trivial, and p ain a worthwhile preparation for the \"Kingdom of God\". How well the utter hypocrisy comes forth when the \"righteous\" make a c hange in their religion to keep up with man's natural change! The only way that Christianity can ever completely serve the needs of man is to become as Satanism is NOW . It has become nece ssary for a NEW religion, based on man's natural instincts, to come forth. THEY have named it. It is called Satanism. It is that power condemned that has caused the religious controversy over birth-control m easures - a disgruntled admission that sexual activity, for fun, is here to stay. It is the \"Devil\" who caused women to show their legs, to titillate men - the same kind of legs, now socially acce ptable to gaze upon, which are revealed by y oung nuns as they walk about in their shortened habits. What a delightful step in the right (or left) direction! Is it possible we will soo n see \"topless\" nuns s ensually throwing their bodies about t o the \"Missa Solemnis Rock\"? Satan smiles and says he would like that fine - many nuns are very pretty girls with nice legs. Many churches with some of the largest congregations have the most hand-clapping, sensual music - also Satanically inspired. After all, the Devil has always had the best tunes. Church picnics, despite a ll of Aunt Martha's talk about the Lord's Bountiful Harvest, are nothing more than a goo d excuse for Sunday gluttony; and everyone knows that lots more than Bible reading goes on in the bushes. The fund-raising adjunct to many church b azaa rs is comm only known as a ca rnival, which used to mean the ce lebration of the flesh; now a ca rnival is okay beca use the money goes to the c hurch so that it can preac h against the temptations of the Devil! It will be said that these things are only pagan devices and ceremonies - that the Christians borrowed them. True, but the Pagans revelled in the delights of the flesh, and were c ondemned by the very same people who celebrate their rituals, but call them by different names. Priests and ministers are in the front lines of peace demonstrations, and lying on railroad tracks in front of trains carrying war materials, with as much dedication as their brothers of the c loth, from the same seminaries, who are blessing the bullets and bombs and fighting men as chaplains in the armed forces. Someone must be wrong, someplace . Could it be that Satan is the one qualified to act as accuser? Certainly they named him that!

Why not call i t something like 'Humanism' or a name that would have the c onnotation of a witchcraft group, something a little more e soteric - something less blatant.\" There is more than one reason for this. Humanism i s not a religion. It is s imply a way of life with n o ceremony or dogma. Satanism has both ceremony and dogma. Dogma, as will be explained, is necessary. Satanism differs greatly from all other so-called white-light, \"white\" witchcraft or magical groups in the world today. These self-righteous and supercilious religions protest that their members use the powers of magic only for altruistic purposes. Satanists loo k with disdain upon \"white\" witchcraft groups beca use they feel that altruism i s s inning on the lay-away plan. It is unnatural not to have desire to gain things for yourself. Satanism represents a form of controlled selfishness. This does not mean that you never do anything for anyone e lse. If you d o something to make someone for whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a sense of gratification. Satanism advocates practicing a modified form of the Golden Rule. Our interpretation of this rule is: \"Do unto o thers as they do unto you\"; beca use if you \"Do unto o thers as you would have them do unto you,\" and they, in turn, treat you badly, it goes against human n ature to continue to treat them with consideration. You should d o unto o thers as you would have them do unto you, but if your courtesy is not returned, they should be treated with the wrath they deserve. White witchcraft groups s ay that if you curse a person, it will return to you three-fold, come home to roo st, or in some way boo merang back to the sender. This is yet another indication of the guilt- ridden philosophy which is held by these neo-Pagan, pseudo-Christian groups. White witches want t o delve into witchcraft, but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma a ttached to it. Therefore, they call themselves white magicians, and base seventy-five per cent of their philosophy on the trite a nd hackneyed tenets of Christianity. Anyone who pretends to be interested in magic or the occult for reasons other that gaining p ersonal power is the worst kind of hypocrite. The Satanist respects Christianity for, at least, being consistent in its guilt-ridden philosophy, but can only feel contempt for the people who attempt to appear emancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group, and then practice the same basic philosophy as Christianity. White magic is s upp osedly utilized only for goo d or unselfish purposes, and black magic, we a re told, is used only for selfish or \"evil\" reasons. Satanism draws no such dividing line. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magician, should have the a bility to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 During white magical ceremonies, the practitioners s tand within a pentagram to protect themselves from the \"evil\" forces which they call upon for help.

The Satanist realizes that only by putting himself in league with these forces can b e fully and u nhypocritically utilize the Powers of Darkness to his best advantage. In a Satanic magical ceremony, the participants do NO T : join h ands and d ance \"ring around the rosy\" in a c ircle; burn candles of various colors for various wishes; call out the names of \"Father, Son and Holy Ghost\" while supp osedly practicing Black Arts; pick a \"Saint\" for their personal guide in obtaining help for their problems; dunk themselves in smelly oils and hope the money comes in; meditate so they can arrive a t a \"great spiritual awakening\"; recite long incantations with the name of Jesus thrown in for goo d measure, between every few w ords, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseam! BECAUSE - This is NO T the way to practice Satanic magic. If you cannot divorce yourself from hypocritical self-deceit, you will never be successful as a magician, much less a Satanist. The Satanic religion h as not merely lifted the c oin - it has flipped it completely over. Therefore, why should it supp ort t he very principles to which it is completely opposed by calling itself anything other than a name which is totally in keeping with the reve rsed doctrines which make up the Satanic philosophy? Satanism i s not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal - all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path. Inevitably, the next question asked is: \"Granted, you can't call i t humanism beca use humanism i s not a religion; but why even h ave a religion in the first place if all you d o is what comes naturally, anyway? Why not just do it?\" Modern man h as come a long way; he has become disenchanted with the nonsensical dogmas of past religions. We a re living in an enlightened age. Psychiatry has made great strides in enlightening man about his true personality. We a re living in an era of intellectual awareness unlike any the world has ever seen. This is all very well and g oo d, BUT - there is one flaw in this new state of awareness. It is one thing to acce pt something intellectually, but to acce pt the same thing emotionally is an entirely different matter. The one need that psychiatry cannot fill i s man's inherent need for emotionalizing through dogma. Man n eeds ceremony and ritual, fantasy and enchantment. Psychiatry, despite a ll the goo d it has done, has robbed man of wonder and fantasy which religion, in the past, has provided. Satanism, realizing the c urrent needs of man, fills the large grey void between religion and psychiatry. The Satanic philosophy combines the fundamentals of psychology and goo d, honest emotionalizing, or dogma. It provides man with h is much n eeded fantasy. There is nothing wrong with dogma, providing it is not based on ideas and actions which go completely against human nature. The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line. If all the guilts that have been b uilt up can b e turned into advantages, it elimi nates the need for intellectual purging of the psyche in an attempt to cleanse it from these repressions. Satanism i s the only religion known to man that acce pts man as he is, and p romotes the rationale of turning a bad thing into a goo d thing rather than bending over backwards to eliminate the bad thing. Therefore, after intellectually evaluating your problems through comm on sense a nd d rawing on what psychiatry has taught us, if you still cannot emotionally release yourself from unwarranted guilt, and pu t your theories into action, then you should learn to make your guilt work for you. You should act upon your natural instincts, and then, if you cannot perform without feeling gu ilty, revel in your guilt.

The false doctrine of Hell and the Devil has allowed the Protestant and Catholic Churches to flourish far too long. Without a devil to point their fingers at, religionists of the right hand p ath would have nothing with which to threaten their followers. \"Satan leads you to temptation\"; \"Satan is the prince of evil\"; \"Satan is vicious, cruel, brutal,\" they warn. \"If you g ive in to the temptations of the devil, you will surely suffer eternal damnation and roast in Hell.\" The semantic meaning of Satan is the \"adversary\" or \"opposition\" or the \"acc user\". The very word \"devil\" comes from the Indian devi which means \"god\". Satan represents opposition to all religions which serve to frustrate a nd condemn man for his natural instincts. He has been given an evil role simply because he represents the carnal, earthly, and mundane aspects of life. Satan, the c hief devil of the Western World, was originally an angel whose duty was to report human delinquencies to God. It was not until the Fourteenth Century that he began to be depicted as an evil deity who was part man and p art animal, with goat-like horns and hoo ves. Before Christianity gave him the names of Satan, Lucifer, etc., the ca rnal side of man's nature was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus, or Pan, depicted as a satyr or faun, by the Greeks. Pan was originally the \"good guy\", and symbolized fertility and fecundity. Whenever a nation comes under a new form of government, the heroes of the past become villains of the present. So it is with religion. The ea rliest Christians believed that the Pagan deities were devils, and to employ them was to use \"black magic\". Miraculous heavenly events they termed \"white magic\"; this was the sole distinction b etween the two. The old g ods did not die, they fell into Hell and beca me devils. The bogey, goblin, or bugaboo used to frighten children is derived from the Slavonic \"Bog\" which means \"god\", as does Bhaga in Hindu. Many pleasures revered before the a dvent of Christianity were c ondemned by the new religion. It required little c hangeover to transform the horns and cloven h oo ves of Pan into a most convincing devil! Pan's attributes could be neatly changed into charged-with-punishment sins, and so the metamorphosis was complete. The a ssociation of the goat with the Devil is found in the Christian Bible, where the holiest day of the year, the Day of Atonement, was celebrated by casting lots for two goats \"without blemish\", one to be offered to the Lord, and one to Azaze l. The goat carrying the sins of the people was driven into the desert and beca me a \"scapegoat\". This is the origin of the goat which is s till used in lodge ce remonies today as it was also used in Egypt, where once a year it was s acrificed to a God. The devils of mankind are many, and their origins diversified. The performance of Satanic ritual does not embrace the ca lling forth of demons; this practice is followed only by those who are in fear of the very forces they conjure. Supp osedly, demons are malevolent spirits with attributes conductive to the deterioration of the people or events that they touch upon. The Greek word demon meant a guardian spirit or source of inspiration, and to be sure, later theologians invented legion upon legion of these harbingers of inspiration - all wicked."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 An indication of the c owardice of \"magicians\" of the right-hand p ath is the practice of calling upon a particular demon (who would supp osedly be a minion of the devil) to do his bidding.

Occult lore states that only the most formidably \"protected\" or insanely foo lhardy sorcerer would try to call forth the Devil himself. The Satanist does not furtively call upon these \"lesser\" devils, but braze nly invokes those who people that infernal army of long-standing outrage - the Devils themselves!

The pig was despised by the Jews and the Egyptians. It symbolized the gods Frey, Osiris, Adonis, Persephone, Attis, and Demeter, and was s acrificed to Osiris and the Moo n. But, in time, it beca me degraded into a devil. The Phoenicians worhipped a fly god, Baal, from which comes the devil, Beelzebub. Both Baal and Beelzebub are identical to the dung beetle or scarabaeus of the Egyptians which appeared to resurrect itself, much as the mythical bird, the phoenix, rose from i ts own ashes. The a ncient Jews believed, through their contact with the Persians, that the two great forces in the world were Ahura-Mazda, the god of fire, light, life, and g oo dness; and Ahriman, the serpent, the god of darkness, destruction, death, and evil. These, and countless other examples, not only depict man's devils as animals, but also show his need to sacrifice the original animal gods and demote them to his devils. At t he time of the Reformation, in the Sixteenth Century, the a lchemist, Dr. Johann Faustus, discovered a method of summ oning a demon - Mephistopheles - from Hell and making a pact with him. He signed a c ontract in b loo d to turn h is s oul over to Mephistopheles in return for the feeling of youth, and at once beca me young. When the time ca me for Faustus to die, he retired to his roo m and was blown to bits as though h is laboratory had exploded. This s tory is a protest of the times (the Sixteenth Century) against science, chemistry, and magic. To the Satanist, it is unnece ssary to sell your soul to the Devil or make a pact with Satan. This threat was devised by Christianity to terrorize people so they would not stray from the fold. With scolding fingers and trembling voices, they taught t heir followers that if they gave in to the temptations of Satan, and lived their lives acc ording to their natural predilictions, they would have to pay for their sinful pleasures by giving their souls to Satan and suffering in Hell for all eternity. People were led to believe that a pure soul was a passport to everlasting life. Pious prophets have taught man to fear Satan. But what of terms like \"God fearing\"? If God is s o merciful, why do people have to fear him? Are we to believe there is nowhere we ca n turn to escape fear? If you have to fear God, why not be \"Satan fearing\" and at least have the fun that being God fearing d enies you? W ithout such a wholesale fear religionists would have had nothing with which to wield power over their followers. The Teutonic Goddess of the Dead and d aughter of Loki was named Hel , a Pagan god of torture and pu nishment. Another \"L\" was added when the boo ks of the Old Testament were formulated. The prophets who wrote the Bible did not know the word \"Hell\"; they used the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades , which meant the grave; also the Greek Tartaros , which was the a bode of fallen angels, the underworld (inside the ea rth), and Gehenna , which was a valley near Jerusalem where Moloch reigned and g arbage was dumped and burned. It is from this that the Christian Church h as evolved the idea of \"fire and brimstone\" in Hell. The Protestant Hell and the Catholic Hell are place s of eternal punishment; however, the Catholics also believe there is a \"Purgatory\" where a ll souls go for a time, and a \"Limbo\" where unbaptized souls go. The Budd hist Hell is divided into eight sections, the first seven of which can be e xpiated. The ecc lesiastical description of Hell is that of a horrible place of fire a nd torment; in Dante's Inferno , and in n orthern clim es, it was thought t o be a n icy cold region, a giant refrigerator."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 (Even with all their threats of eternal damnation and soul roasting, Christian missionaries have run across s ome who were not so quick to swallow their drivel.

Most Satanists do not acce pt Satan as an anthropomorphic being with cloven h oo ves, a barbed tail, and horns. He merely represents a force in n ature - the powers of darkness which h ave been named just that beca use no religion h as taken these forces out of the darkness.

You cannot love e veryone; it is ridiculous to think you can. If you love e veryone a nd everything you lose your natural powers of selection and wind up being a pretty poo r judg e of character and qu ality. If anything is used too freely it loses its true meaning. Therefore, the Satanist believes you should love strongly and completely those who deserve your love, but never turn the other cheek to your enemy! Love is one of the most intense e motions felt by man; another is hate. Forcing yourself to feel indiscrimi nate love is very unnatural. If you try to love e veryone you only lessen your feelings for those who deserve your love. Repressed hatred can lead to many physical and emotional ailm ents. By learning to release your hatred towards those who deserve it, you cleanse yourself of these malignant emotions and need not take your pent-up hatred out on your loved ones.

Every hypocrite who ever walked the earth has had pockets buldging with love! Every pharisaical religionist claims to love his enemies, even though when wronged he c onsoles himself by thinking \"God will punish them\". Instead of admitting to themselves that t hey are capable of hating their foes and treating them i n the manner they deserve, they say: \"There, but for the grace of God, go I,\" and \"pray\" for them.

Without being able to experience one of these emotions, you cannot fully experience the other."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 SATANIC SEX M UCH controversy has arisen over the Satanic views on \"free love\". It is often assumed that sexual activity is the most important factor of the Satanic religion, and that willingness to participate in sex-orgies is a prerequisite for becoming a Satanist. Nothing could be farther from the truth! In fact, opportunists who have no deeper interest in Satanism than merely the sexual aspects are emphatically discouraged. Satanism does advocate sexual freedom, but only in the true sense of the word. Free love, in the Satanic c oncept, means exactly that - freedom to either be faithful to o ne person or to indulge your sexual desires with as many others as you feel is nece ssary to satisfy your particular needs. Satanism does not encourage orgiastic ac tivity or extramarital affairs for those to whom they do not come naturally. For many, it would be very unnatural and d etrimental to be unfaithful to their chosen mates. To o thers, it would be frustrating to be bound sexually to just one person. Each person must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his individual needs. Self- dece itfully forcing yourself to be a dulterous or to have sex partners when n ot married just for the sake of proving others (or worse yet, to yourself) that you are e mancipated from sexual guilt is just as wrong, by Satanic standards, as leaving any sexual need u nfulfilled beca use of ingrained feelings of guilt. Many of those who are c onstantly preoccupied with demonstrating their emancipation from sexual guilt are, in reality, held in eve n g reater sexual bondage than those who simply acce pt sexual activity as a natural part of life a nd d on't make a big to-do o ver their sexual freedom. For example, it is an established fact that the nymphomaniac (every man's dream girl and heroine of all lurid novels) is not sexually free, but is actually frigid and roves from m an to man b eca use she is too inhibited to ever find complete sexual release. Another misconception is the idea that ability to engage in group sexual activity is the indicative of sexual freedom. All contemporary free-sex groups have one thing in comm on - discouragement of fetishistic or deviant activity. Actually, the most forced examples of non-fetishistic sexual activity thinly disguised as \"freedom\" have a c omm on format. Each of the participants in an orgy removes all clothing, following the example set forth b y one, and mechanically fornicate - also following the leader's example. None of the performers consider that their \"emancipated\" form of sex might be regarded as regimented and infantile by non-members who fail to equate uniformity with freedom. The Satanist realizes that if he is to be a sexual connoiseur (and truly free from all sexual guilt) he cannot be stifled by the so-called sexual revolutionists any more than h e ca n b y the prudery of his guilt-ridden society. These free-sex clubs miss the whole point of sexual freedom. Unless s exual activity can b e e xpressed on an individual basis (which includes personal fetishes), there is absolutely no purpose in belonging to a sexual freedom organization. Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires - be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual, if you choo se. Satanism also sanctions any fetish or deviation which will enhance your sex-life, so long as it involves no o ne who does not wish to be involved. The prevalence of deviant and/or fetishistic behavior in our society would stagger the imagination of the sexually naïve. There a re more sexual variants than the unenlightened individual can perceive: transvestism, sadism, masochism, urolagnia, exhibitionism - to name only a few of the more predominant. Everyone has s ome form of f etish, but beca use they are unaware of the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 preponderance of fetishistic ac tivity in our society, they feel they are depraved if they submit to their \"unnatural\" yearnings. Even the a sexual has a deviation - his asexuality . It is far more a bnormal to have a lack of sexual desire (unless illness or old-age, or another valid reason h as caused the wane) than it is to be sexually promiscuous. However, if a Satanist choo ses s exual sublimi nation above overt sexual expression, that is entirely his own affair. In many cases of sexual sublimi nation (or asexuality), any attempt to emancipate himself sexually would prove devastating to the asexual. Asexuals are invariably sexually sublim ated by their jobs or hobbies. All the e nergy and d riving interest which would normally be devoted to sexual activity is channelled into o ther pastimes or into their chosen occupations. If a person favors other interests over sexual activity, it is his right, and no o ne is justified in condemning him for it. However, the person should at least recognize the fact that this is a sexual sublimation. Beca use of lack of opportunity for expression, many secret sexual desires never progress beyond the fantasy stage. Lack of release often leads to compulsion and, therefore, a great number of people devise undetectable methods of giving vent to their urges. Just beca use most fetishistic activity is not outwardly apparent, the sexually unsophisticated should not delude himself into thinking it does not exist. To cite e xamples of the ingenious techniques used: The male transvestite will i ndulge in h is fetish b y wearing feminine undergarments while going about his daily activities; or the masochistic woman might wear a rubber girdle several sizes too small, so she may derive sexual pleasure from her fetishistic discomfort throughout the day, with n o o ne the wiser. These illustrations are far tamer and more prevalent examples than others which could have been given. Satanism encourages any form of sexual expression you may desire, so long a s it hurts no on e else . This s tatement must be qualified, to avoid misinterpretation. By not hurting another, this does not include the unintentional hurt felt by those who might not agree with your views on sex, beca use of their anxieties regarding sexual m orality. Naturally, you should avoid offending others who mean a great deal to you, such as prudish friends and relatives. However, if you earnestly endeavor to escape hurting them, and d espite your efforts they acc identally find out, you cannot be held responsible, and therefore should feel no guilt as a result of either your sexual convictions, or their being hurt beca use of those c onvictions. If you are in constant fear of offending the prudish b y y our attitude towards s ex, then there is no sense in trying to emancipate yourself from sexual guilt. However, no purpose is served by flaunting your permissiveness. The other exception to the rule regards dealings with masochists. A masochist derives pleasure from being hurt; so denying the masochist his pleasure-through-pain h urts him just as much as actual physical pain h urts the non-masochist. The story of the truly cruel sadist illustrates this point: The masochist says to the sadist, \"beat me.\" To which the merciless s adist replies, \" NO !\" If a person wants to be hurt and enjoys s uffering, then there is no reason n ot to indulge him i n h is wont. The term \"sadist\" in popular usage describes one who o btains pleasure from i ndiscrimi nate brutality. Actually, though, a true sadist is s elective. He ca refully choo ses from the vast reserve of appropriate victims, and takes great delight in giving those who thrive on misery the fulfillm ent of their desires. The \"well-adjusted\" sadist is epicurean in selecting those on whom his energies will be well-spent! If a person is healthy enough to admit he is a masochist and enjoys being enslaved and whipped, the real sadist is glad to oblige! Aside from the foregoing exceptions, the Satanist would not intentionally hurt others by violating their sexual rights. If you attempt to impose your sexual desires upon others who do not welcome your advances, you are infringing up on their sexual freedom. Therefore, Satanism does not advocate rape, child molesting, sexual defilement of animals, or any other form of sexual activity"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 which entails the participation of those who are unwilling or whose innocence or naïveté would allow them to be intimidated or misguided into doing something against their wishes. If all parties involved are mature a dults who willingly take full responsibility for their actions and voluntarily engage in a given form of sexual expression - eve n if it i s generally c onsidered taboo - then there is no reason for them to repress their sexual inclinations. If you are a ware of all the implications, advantages, and d isadvantages, and are ce rtain your actions will hurt no o ne who does not wish or deserve to be hurt, you have no cause to supp ress your sexual preferences. Just as no two people a re e xactly the same in their choice of diet or have the same ca pacity for the consumption of f oo d, sexual tastes and appetites vary from person to person. No person or society has the right to set limi tations on the sexual standards or the frequency of sexual activity of another. Proper sexual conduct can only be judg ed within the c ontext of eac h individual situation. Therefore, what one person considers s exually correct and moral m ay be frustrating to another. The reverse is also true; one person may have great sexual prowess, but it is unjust for him to belittle a nother whose sexual capacity may not equal his own, and inconsiderate for him to impose himself upon the other person, i.e., the man who has a voracious s exual appetite, but whose wife's s exual needs do not match h is own. It is unfair for him to expect her to enthusiastically respond to his overtures; but she must display the same degree of thoughtfulness. In the instances when she does not feel great passion, she should either passively, but pleasantly , acce pt him sexually, or r aise no complaint if he c hoo ses to find his needed release e lsewhere - including auto-erotic practices. The ideal relationship is one in which the people a re deeply in love with one a nother and are sexually compatible. However, perfect relationships are relatively uncomm on. It is important to point out here that spiritual love a nd sexual love ca n, but do not nece ssarily, go hand in h and. If there is a ce rtain amount of sexual compatibility, often it is limi ted; and some, but not all, of the sexual desires will be fulfilled. There is no greater sexual pleasure than that derived from association with someone you d eeply love, if you are sexually well-suited. If you are not suited to o ne a nother sexually, though, it must be stressed that lack of sexual compatibility does not indicate lack of spiritual love. One ca n, and often does, exist without the other. As a matter of fact, often one member of a c ouple will resort to o utside sexual activity because he deeply loves his mate, and wishes to avoid hurting or imposing up on h is loved one. Deep spiritual love is enriched by sexual love, and it is certainly a nece ssary ingredient for any satisfactory relationship; but beca use of differing sexual predilictions, outside sexual activity or masturbation sometimes provides a needed supplement. Masturbation, considered a sexual taboo by many people, creates a guilt problem not easily dealt with. Much emphasis must be place d on this s ubject, as it constitutes an extremely important ingredient of many a successful magical working. Ever since the Judaeo-Christian Bible described the sin of Onan (Gen. 38:7-10), man h as considered the seriousness and consequences of the \"solitary vice\". Even though modern sexologists have e xplained the sin of Onan as s imply coitus interruptus , the damage has been done through centuries of theological misinterpretation. Aside from actual sex crimes, masturbation is one of the most frowned up on sexual acts. During the last century, innumerable texts were written describing the horrific c onsequences of masturbation. Practically all physical or mental ill nesses were a ttributed to the e vils of masturbation. Pallor of the c omplexion, shortness of breath, furtive e xpression, sunken chest, nervousness, pimples and loss of appetite a re only a few of the many characteristics s upp osedly resulting from m asturbation; total physical and mental collapse was assured if one did not heed the warnings in those handbooks for young men."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 The lurid d escriptions in such texts would be a lmost humorous, were it not for the unhappy fact that even though contemporary sexologists, doctors, writers, etc. have done much to remove the stigma of masturbation, the deep-seated gu ilts induced by the nonsense in those sexual primers have been only partially erased. A large percentage of people, especially those over forty, cannot emotionally acce pt the fact that masturbation is natural and healthy, even if they now acce pt it intellectually; and they, in turn, relate their repugnance, often subconsciously, to their children. It was thought t hat one would g o insane if, despite numerous admonitions, his auto-erotic practices persisted. This preposterous myth grew from reports of wide-spread masturbation b y the inmates of mental institutions. It was assumed that since a lmost all i ncurably insane people masturbated, it was their masturbation that had d riven them m ad. No o ne e ver stopped to consider the lack of sexual partners of the opposite sex and the freedom from i nhibition, which is a c haracteristic of extreme insanity, were the real reasons for the masturbatory practices of the insane. Many people would rather have their mates s eek outside sexual activity than perform auto-erotic acts beca use of their own guilt feelings, the mate's repug nance towards having them engage in masturbation, or the fear of their mate's repug nance - although in a surprising number of cases, a vicarious thrill i s obtained from the knowledge that the mate is having sexual experiences with outsiders - although this is seldom admitted. If stimulation is provided by envisioning one's mate sexually engaged with others, this s hould be brought out into the open where both parties may gain from such activities. However, if the prohibition of masturbation is only due to guilt feelings on the part of one or both parties, they should make e very attempt to erase those guilts - or utilize them. Many relationships might be saved from destruction if the people involved d id not feel guilt about performing the natural act of masturbation. Masturbation is regarded as evil beca use it produces pleasure derived from i ntentionally fondling a \"forbidden\" area of the body by one's own h and. The guilt feelings acc ompanying most sexual acts can b e a ssuaged by the religiously-acce ptable c ontention that your sensual delights are nece ssary to produce off-spring - even though you cautiously watch the ca lendar for the \"safe\" days. You cannot, however, placate yourself with this rationale while engaging in masturbatory practices. No matter what you've been told about the \"imm aculate c onception\" - even if blind faith allows you to swallow this absurdity - you k now full well i f you are to produce a c hild, there must be sexual contact with a person of the opposite sex! If you feel guilty for commi tting the \"original sin,\" you certainly will feel even deeper guilt for performing a sex act only for self-gratification, with no intention of creating children. The Satanist fully realizes why religionists declare masturbation to be sinful. Like a ll other natural acts people will do it, no matter how severely reprimanded. Causing gu ilt is an important face t of their malicious s cheme to o bligate people to atone for \"sins\" by paying the mortgages on temples of abstinence! Even if a person is no longer strugg ling u nder the burden of religiously-induced gu ilt (or thinks he isn't), modern man still feels s hame if he yields to his masturbatory desires. A man may feel robbed of his masculinity if he satisfies himself auto-erotically rather than engaging in the c ompetitive game of woman chasing. A woman may satisfy herself sexually but yearns for the e go- gratification that comes from the sport of seduction. Neither the quasi Casanova nor bogus vamp feels adequate when \"reduced\" to masturbation for sexual gratification; both would p refer even an inadequate partner. Satanically speaking, though, it is far better to engage in a perfect fantasy than to coo perate in an unrewarding experience with another person. With masturbation, you are in complete control of the situation."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 To illustrate the undebatable fact that masturbation is an entirely normal and healthy practice: it is performed by all m embers of the a nimal kingdom. Human children will also follow their instictive masturbatory desires, unless they have been scolded for it by their indignant parents, who were undoubtably berated for it by their parents, and so on down the retrocedent line. It is unfortunate, but true, that the sexual guilts of parents will imm utably be passed on to their children. In order to save our children from the ill-fated sexual destiny of our parents, grandparents, and p ossibly ourselves, the perverted moral code of the past must be e xposed for what it is: a pragmatically organized set of rules which, if rigidly obeyed, would d estroy us! Unless we e mancipate ourselves from the ridiculous s exual standards of our present society, including the so-called sexual revolution, the neuroses caused by those stifling regulations will persist. Adherence to the sensible a nd humanistic new morality of Satanism can - and will - evolve society in which our children can grow up healthy and without t he devastating moral encumbrances of our existing sick society."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 NOT ALL VAMPIRES SUCK BLOOD! S ATANISM represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires. Many people who walk the ea rth practice the fine a rt of making others feel responsible a nd even indebted to them, without cause. Satanism observes these leec hes in their true light. Psychic vampires are individuals who drain others of their vital energy. This type of person can b e found in all avenues of society. They fill no useful purpose in our lives, and are neither love objects nor true friends. Yet we feel responsible to the psychic vampire without knowing why. If you think you may be the victim of such a person, there a re a few simple rules which will help you form a decision. Is there a person you often call or visit, even though you really don't want to, beca use you k now you will feel guilty if you d on't? Or, do you find yourself constantly doing favors for one who doesn't come forward and ask, but hints? Often the psychic vampire will use reverse psychology, saying: \"Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that\" - and you, in turn, insist upon doing it. The psychic vampire neve r d emands anything of you. That would be far too presumptuous. They simply let their wishes be known in subtle ways which will prevent t hem from being considered p ests. They \"wouldn't t hink of imposing\" and are a lways content and willingly accept their lot, without the slightest complaint - outwardly! Their sins are not of commi ssion, but of omission. It's what they don 't say, not what they do say, that makes you feel you must acc ount to them. They are much too crafty to make overt demands upon you, beca use they know you would resent it, and would have a tangible a nd legitimate reason for denying them. A large percentage of these people have special \"attributes\" which make their dependence upon you more feasible a nd much more e ffective. Many psychic vampires are invalids (or pretend to be) or are \"mentally or emotionally disturbed.\" Others might feign ignorance or incompetence so you will, out of pity - or more often, exasperation - do things for them. The traditional way to banish a demon or elemental is to recognize it for what it is, and exorcise it. Recognition of these modern-day demons and their methods is the only antidote for their devastating hold over you. Most people acce pt these passively vicious individuals at face value only beca use their insidious maneuvers have never been pointed out to them. They merely acce pt these \"poo r souls\" as being less fortunate than themselves, and feel they must help them however they can. It is this misdirected sense of responsibility (or unfounded sense of guilt) which n ourishes well the \"altruisms\" upon which these parasites feast! The psychic vampire is allowed to exist beca use he c leverly choo ses conscientious, responsible people for his victims - people with great dedication to their \"moral obligations.\" In some ca ses we a re vampirized by groups of people, as well as individuals. Every fund raising organization, be it a c haritable foundation, comm unity council, religious or fraternal association, etc., carefully selects a person who is adept at making others feel guilty for its chairman or coo rdinator. It is the job of this chairman to intimi date us into o pening first our hearts, and then our wallets, to the recipient of their \"goo d will\" - never mentioning that, in many cases, their time is not unselfishly donated, but that they are drawing a fat salary for their \"noble deeds.\" They are masters at playing up on the sympathy and consideration of responsible people. How often we see"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 little c hildren who have been sent forth b y these self-righteous Fagins to painlessly extract donations from the kindly. Who can resist the innocent charm of a child? There a re, of course, people who are not happy unless they are giving, but many of us do not fit into this category. Unfortunately, we a re often put upon to do things we do not genuinely feel should be required of us. A conscientious person finds it very difficult t o decide between voluntary and imposed charity. He wants to do what is right and just, and finds it perplexing trying to decide e xactly who he should help and what degree of aid should rightfully be e xpected of him. Each person must decide for himself what his obligations are to his respective friends, famil y, and comm unity. Before donating his time a nd money to those outside his imm ediate famil y and close circle of friends, he must decide what he ca n afford, without depriving those c losest to him. When taking these things into consideration h e must be ce rtain to include himself among those who mean most to him. He must carefully evaluate the validity of the request and the personality or motives of the person asking it of him. It is extremely difficult for a person to learn to say \"no\" when all his life he has s aid \"yes.\" But unless he wants to be c onstantly taken advantage of, he must learn to say \"no\" when circumstances justify doing so. If you allow them, psychic vampires will gradually infiltrate your everyday life until you have no privacy left - and your constant feeling of concern for them will deplete you of all ambition. A psychic vampire will always s elect a person who is relatively content and satisfied with h is life - a person who is happily married, pleased with h is job, and g enerally well-adjusted to the world around him - to feed up on. The very fact that the psychic vampire c hoo ses to victimi ze a happy person shows that he is lacking all the things his victim has; he will do everything he ca n to stir up trouble and disharmony between his victim and those people he holds dear. Therefore, be wary of anyone who seems to have no real friends and no appearant interest in life (except you). He will usually tell you he is very selective in h is choice of friends, or doesn't make friends easily beca use of the high standards he sets for his companions. (To acquire and kee p friends, one must be willing to give of himself - something of which the psychic vampire is incapable.) But he will hasten to add that you fulfill every requirement and are truly an outstanding exception among men - you are one of the very few worthy of his friendship. Lest you confuse desperate love (which is a very selfish thing) with psychic vampirism, the vast difference between the two must be c larified. The only way to determine if you are being vampirized is to weigh what you give the person compared to what they give you in return. You may, at times, become a nnoyed with the obligations put upon you by a loved one, a c lose friend, or even an employer. But before you label them psychic vampires, you must ask yourself, \"What am I getting in return?\" If your spouse or lover insists that you call them frequently, but you also require them to acc ount to you for their time spent away from you, you must realize this is a give a nd take situation. Or, if a friend is in the habit of calling up on you for help at inopportune moments, but you simil arly depend up on them to give your imm ediate needs priority, you must regard it as a fair exchange. If your employer asks you to do a little more than is normally expected of you in your particular position, but will overloo k occa sional tardiness or will give you time off when you need it, you certainly have no cause for complaint and need not feel he is taking advantage of you. You are, however, being vampirized if you are incessantly called up on or expected to do favors for someone who, when you need a favor, always happens to have other \"pressing obligations.\" Many psychic vampires will give you material things for the e xpress purpose of making you feel you owe them something in return, thereby binding you to them. The difference between your giving, and theirs, is that your return payment must come in a non-material form. They want you"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 to feel obligated to them, and would be very disappointed and even resentful if you attempted to repay them with materal objects. In essence, you have \"sold your soul\" to them, and they'll constantly remind you of your duty to them, by not reminding you. Being pu rely Satanic, the only way to deal with a psychic vampire is to \"play dumb\" and act as though they are genuinely altruistic a nd really expect nothing in return. Teac h them a lesson b y graciously taking what they give you, thanking them l oudly enough for all to hear, and walking away! In this way y ou come out the victor. What can they say? And when you are inevitably expected to repay their \"generosity,\" (this is the hard p art!) you say \" NO \" - but again, graciously! When they feel you falling from their clutches two things will happen. First, they will act \"crushed,\" hoping your old feeling of duty and sympathy will return, and when (and if) it doesn't, they will show their true colors and will become angry and vindictive. Once you have moved them to this point, YOU can play the role of the injured p arty. After all, you've done nothing wrong - you just happened to have had \"pressing obligations\" when they needed you, and since nothing was expected in return for their gifts, there should be no hard feelings. Generally, the psychic vampire will realize his methods have been discovered and will not press the issue. He will not continue to waste his time with you, but will m ove on to his next unsuspecting victim. There a re times, however, when the psychic vampire will not release his hold so easily, and will do everything p ossible to torment you. They have plenty of time for this beca use, when once rejected, they wil neglect all else (what little e lse they have, that is) to devote their every waking moment to planning the revenge to which they feel they are e ntitled. For this reason, it is best to avoid a relationship with this kind of person in the first place . Their \"adulation\" and d ependence upon you may, at first, be very flattering, and their material gifts very attractive, but you will eventually find yourself paying for them many times over. Don't waste your time with people who will ultimately destroy y ou, but concentrate instead on those who will appreciate your responsibility to them, and, likewise, feel responsible to you. And if you are a psychic vampire - take heed! Beware of the Satanist - he is ready and willing to gleefully drive the proverbial stake through your heart!"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 INDULGENCE... NOT COMPULSION THE HIGHEST PLATEAU OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS THE AWARENESS OF THE FLESH! S ATANISM encourages its followers to indulge in their natural desires. Only by doing so can you be a c ompletely satisfied p erson with n o frustrations which can b e harmful to yourself and others around you. Therefore, the most simplified d escription of the Satanic belief is: INDULGENCE INSTEAD OF ABSTINENCE People often mistake c ompulsion for indulgence, but there is a world of difference between the two. A compulsion is never created by indulging, but by not being able to indulge. By making something taboo , it only serves to intensify the desire. Everyone likes to do the things they have been told not to. \"Forbidden fruits are sweetest.\" Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary defines indu lgence thusly: \"To give oneself up to; not t o restrain or oppose; to give free c ourse to; to gratify by compliance; to yeild to.\" The dictionary definition of compulsion is: \"The ac t of compelling or driving by a force, physical or moral; constraint of the will; (compulsory, obligatory).\" In other words, indulgence implies choice, whereas compulsion indicates the lack of choice. When a person h as no proper r elease for his desires they rapidly build up and become compulsions. If everyone had a particular time a nd p lace for the purpose of periodically indulging in their personal desires, without fear of embarrassment or r eproach, they would be sufficiently released to lead u nfrustrated lives in the e veryday world. They would be free to plunge headlong into whatever undertaking they might choo se instead of going about their duties half-heartedly, their creative urges frustrated by denying their natural desires. This would apply in the majority of cases, but there will always be those who work better under pressure. Generally, those who need to endure a ce rtain amount of hardship to produce to their full capabilities are in b asically artistic vocations. (More will be said later about fulfillm ent through self-denial.) This does not mean to imply that all artists fit into this category. On the c ontrary, many artists are unable to produce unless their basic animal needs have been satisfied. For the most part, it is not the a rtist or individualist, but the a verage middle-class working man or woman who is lacking the proper r elease for their desires. It is ironic that t he responsible, respectable person - the one who pays s ociety's bills - should be the one given the least in return. It is he who must be e ver conscious of his \"moral obligations\", and who is condemned for normally indulging in his natural desires. The Satanic religion considers this a gross injustice. He who upholds his responsibilities s hould be most entitled to the pleasures of his choice, without censure from the society he serves. Finally a religion (Satanism) has been formed which comm ends and rewards those who supp ort the society in which they live, instead of denouncing them for their human needs. From every set of principles (be it religious, political, or philosophical), some goo d can b e extracted. Amidst the madness of the Hitlerian concept, one point stands out as a shining example of this - \"strength through joy!\". Hitler was no foo l when h e offered the German people happiness, on a personal level , to insure their loyalty to him, and peak efficiency from them. It has been clearly established that the majority of all ill nesses are of a psychosomatic nature, and that psychosomatic illnesses are a direct result of frustration. It has been said that \"the goo d d ie"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 young\". The goo d, by Christian standards, do die young. It is the frustration of our natural instincts which leads to the deterioration of our minds and bodies. It has become very fashionable to concentrate on the betterment of the mind and spirit, and to consider giving p leasure to o ne's body (the very shell without which the mind and spirit could not exist) to be c oarse, crude, unrefined. AS OF LATE , MOST PEOPLE WHO D EE M THEMSELVES EMANCIPATE D H AVE LEFT NO RMALCY ON LY TO \"TRANSCEND \" INTO IDIOCY ! By way of bending their behinds around to meet their navels, subsisting on wild and exotic diets like brown rice a nd tea, they feel they will arive at a great state of spiritual development. \"Hogwash!\" says the Satanist. He would rather eat a goo d hearty meal, exercise his imagination, and transcend by means of physical and emotional fulfillm ent. It seems, to the Satanist, that after being harnessed with unreasonable religious demands for so many centuries, one would welcome the chance to be human for once! If anyone thinks that by denying his natural desires he ca n avoid mediocrity, he should examine the Eastern mystical beliefs which h ave been in great intellectual favor in rece nt years. Christianity is \"old-hat\", so those who wish to escape its fetters have turned to so-called enlightened religions, such as Budd hism. Although Christianity is certainly deserving of the c riticism i t has rece ived, perhaps it has been taking more than its s hare of the blame. The followers of the mystical beliefs are e very bit as guilty of the little humanisms as the \"misguided\" Christians. Both religions are based on trite philosophies, but the mystical religionists profess to be e nlightened and emancipated from the guilt-ridden dogma which is typified by Christianity. However, the Eastern mystic is even more preoccupied than the Christian with avoiding animalistic ac tions that remind him he is not a \"saint\", but merely a man - only another form of animal, sometimes better, more often worse , than those who walk on all fours; and who, becuase of his \"divine spiritual and intellectual development\", has become the most vicious animal of all! The Satanist asks, \"What is wrong with b eing human, and having human limi tations as well as assets?\" By denying his desires the mystic has come no closer to o vercoming compulsion than h is kindred soul, the Christian. The Eastern mystical beliefs have taught people to contemplate their navels, stand on their heads, stare a t blank walls, avoid the use of labels in life, and d iscipline themselves against any desire for materialistic pleasure. Nevertheless, I am sure you have seen just as many so-called d esciplined yogis with the inablility to control a smoking habit as anyone e lse; or just as many supp osedly emancipated Budd hists become just as excited as a \"less aware\" person when they are c onfronted with a member of the opposite - or in some ca ses, the same - sex. Yet when asked to explain the reason for their hypocrisy, these people retreat into the ambiguousness which characterizes their faith - no o ne ca n pin them down if there a re no straight answers that can be given! The simple fact of the matter is that the very thing which h as led this type of person to a faith which preac hes abstinence, is indu lgence . Their compulsive masochism i s the reason for choo sing a religion which n ot only advocates s elf-denial, but praises them for it; and g ives them a sacrosanct avenue of expression for their masochistic needs. The more a buse they can stand, the holier they become. Masochism, to most people, represents a rejection of indulgence. Satanism points out many meanings behind the meanings, and considers masochism to be a n indu lgence if any attempt to sway or change the person from his masochistic traits is met with resentment and/or failure. The Satanist does not condemn these people for giving vent to their masochistic desires, but he does feel the utmost contempt towards those who cannot be honest enough (at least with themselves) to face and accept their masochism as a natural part of their personality make-up. Having to use religion as an excuse for their masochism i s bad enough, but these people ac tually have the e ffrontery to feel superior to those who are not bound-up in self-dece itful expression of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 their fetishes! These people would be the first to condemn a man who found his weekly release with a person who would beat him soundly, thereby releasing himself from the very thing which could, if unreleased, make him - as they are - a c ompulsive c hurch-goer or r eligious fanatic. By finding adequate release for his masochistic desires, he no longer needs to debase a nd d eny himself in his every waking moment, as do these compulsive masochists. Satanists are e ncouraged to indulge in the seven deadly sins, as they need hurt no o ne; they were only invented by the Christian Church to insure guilt on the part of its followers. The Christian Church knows that it is impossible for anyone to avoid commi tting these sins, as they are a ll things which we, being human, most naturally do. After inevitably commi tting these sins financial offerings to the c hurch in order to \"pay off\" God are e mployed as a sop to the parishioner's conscience! Satan h as never needed a boo k of rules, beca use vital natural forces have kept man \"sinful\" and intent on preserving himself and his feelings. Nevertheless, demoralizing attempts have been made on h is body and being for his \"soul's\" sake, which only illustrate how misconceived and misused the labels of \"indulgence\" versus \"compulsion\" have become. Sexual activity certainly is condoned and encouraged by Satanism, but obviously the fact that it is the only religion which h onestly takes this s tand, is the reason it has been traditionally given so much literary space. Naturally, if most people belong to the religions which repress them sexually, anything written on this provocative subject is going to make for titillating reading. If all attempts to sell something (be it a product or an idea) have failed - sex will always s ell i t. The reason for this is that even though people now consciously acce pt sex as a normal and nece ssary function, their subconscious is s till bound by the taboo which religion h as place d up on it. So, again, what is denied is more intensely desired. It is this bugaboo regarding sex which causes the literature devoted to the Satanic views on the subject to o vershadow all else written about Satanism. The true Satanist is not mastered by sex any more than h e is mastered by any of his other desires. As with all other pleasurable things, the Satanist is master of , rather than mastered by sex. He is not the perverted fiend who is just waiting for the opportunity to deflower every y oung virgin, nor is he the skulking d egenerate who furtively hangs around in the \"dirty\" boo kstores, slavering over the \"nasty\" pictures. If pornography fills his needs for the moment, he unashamedly buys s ome \"choice items\" and guiltlessly peruses them at his leisure. \"We have to acce pt the fact that man h as become disgruntled at being constantly repressed, but we must do everything we ca n to at least temper the sinful desires of man, lest they run rampant in this new age,\" say the religionists of the right-hand p ath to the questioning Satanist. \"Why continue to think of these desires as s hameful and something to be repressed, if you now admit they are natural?\" returns the Satanist. Could it be that the white-light religionists are a bit \"sour- grapes\" about the fact that they didn't think of a religion, before the Satanists, which would be enjoyable to follow; and if the truth were known, would they too not like to have a bit more pleasure out of life, but for fear of losing face , cannot admit it? Could it also be that they are afraid p eople will, after hearing about Satanism, tell themselves \"This is for me - why should I continue with a religion which condemns me for everything I do, even though there is nothing actually wrong with it?\" The Satanist thinks this is more than likely true. There is certainly much evidence that past religions are, every day, lifting more a nd more of their ridiculous restrictions. Even so, when an entire religion is based on abstinence instead of indulgence (as it should be) there is little left when it has been revised to meet the c urrent needs of man. So, why waste time \"buying oats for a dead horse\"? The watchword of Satanism is INDULGENCE instead of \"abstinence\"... BUT - it is not \"compulsion\"."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 ON THE CHOICE OF A HUMAN SACRIFICE T HE supp osed pu rpose in performing the ritual of sacrifice is to throw the e nergy provided by the bloo d of the freshly slaughtered victim i nto the a tmosphere of the magical working, thereby intensifying the magician's chances of success. The \"white\" magician assumes that since bloo d represents the life force, there is no better way to appease the gods or demons than to present t hem with suitable quantities of it. Combine this rationale with the fact that a dying creature is expending an overabundance of adrenal and other biochemical energies, and you have what appears to be an unbeatable combination. The \"white\" magician, wary of the c onsequences involved in the killing of a human b eing, naturally utilizes birds, or other \"lower\" creatures in h is ceremonies. It seems these sanctimonious wretches feel no guilt in the taking of a non-human life, as opposed to a human's. The fact of the matter is that if the \"magician\" is worthy of his name, he will be uninhibited enough to release the nece ssary force from his own bod y , instead of f rom an unwilling and undeserving victim! Contrary to all established magical theory, the release of this force is NO T effected in the ac tual spilling of bloo d, but in the death throes of the living creature! This discharge of bioelectrical energy is the very same phenominon which occurs during any profound heightening of the emotions, such as: sexual orgasm, blind anger, mortal terror, consuming g rief, etc. Of these emotions, the ea siest entered into o f one's own v iolation are sexual orgasm and anger, with grief running a c lose third. Remembering that t he two most readily available of these three (sexual orgasm and anger) have been b urned into man's unconscios as \"sinful\" by religionists, it is s mall wonder they are shunned by the \"white\" magician, who plods along carrying the greatest of all millstones of guilt! The inhibitive a nd asinine a bsurdity in the need to kill an innocent living creature a t the high-point of a ritual, as practiced by erstwhile \"wizards\", is obviously their \"lesser of the e vils\" when a discharge of energy is called for. These poo r conscience-stricken foo ls, who have been calling themselves witches and warlocks, would soo ner chop the head off a goat or chicken in an attempt to harness its death agony, than h ave the \"blasphemous\" bravery to masturbate in full view of the Jehovah whom they claim to deny! The only way these mystical cowards can ritualistically release themselves is through the a gony of another's death (actually their own, by proxy) rather than the indulgent force which produ ces life! The treaders of the path of white light are truly the c old and the dead! No wonder these tittering pu stules of \"mystical wisdom\" must stand within protective circles to bind the \"evil\" forces in order to keep themselves \"safe\" from attack - ON E GOOD O RGASM WOULD PROBABLY KILL THEM ! The use of a human sacrifice in a Satanic ritual does not imply that the sacrifice is s laughtered \"to appease the gods\". Symbolically , the victim i s destroyed through the working of a hex or curse, which in turn leads to the physical, mental or emotional destruction of the \"sacrifice\" in ways and means not attributable to the magician. The only time a Satanist would p erform a human sacrifice would be if it were to serve a two-fold purpose; that being to release the magician's wrath in the throwing of a c urse, and more important, to dispose of a totally obnoxious and deserving individual."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 Under NO circumstances would a Satanist sacrifice a ny animal or baby! For centuries, propagandists of the right-hand p ath h ave been prattling over the supp osed sacrifices of small children and voluptuous maidens at t he hands of diabolists. It would be thought t hat anyone reading or hearing of these heinous acc ounts would imm ediately question their authenticity, taking into consideration the biased sources of the stories. On the c ontrary, as with all \"holy\" lies which are acce pted without reservation, this assumed modus operandi of the Satanists persists to this day! There a re sound and logical reasons why the Satanists could not perform such sacrifices. Man, the animal, is the godhead to the Satanist. The purest form of carnal existence reposes in the bodies of animals and human children who have not grown old enough to deny themselves their natural desires. They can perceive things that the a verage a dult human can n ever hope to. Therefore, the Satanist holds these beings in a sacred regard, knowing he ca n learn much from these natural magicians of the world. The Satanist is aware of the universal custom of the treader of the path of Agarthi; the killing of the god. Inasmuch as gods are a lways created in man's own image - and the a verage man h ates what he sees in h imself - the inevitable must occur: the sacrifice of the god who represents himself. The Satanist does not hate himself, nor the gods he might choo se, and has no desire to destroy himself or anything for which h e stands! It is for this reason h e c ould never willfully harm an animal or child. The question arises, \"Who, then, would be c onsidered a fit and p roper human sacrifice, and how is one qualified to pass judg ment on such a person?\" The a nswer is brutally simple. Anyone who has unjustly wronged you - one who has \"gone out of his way\" to hurt you - to deliberately cause trouble a nd hardship for you or those dear to you. In short, a person asking to be c ursed by their very actions. When a person, by his reprehensible behavior, practically cries out to be destroyed, it is truly y our moral obligation to indulge them their wish. The person who takes every opportunity to \"pick on\" others is often mistakenly called \"sadistic\". In reality, this person is a misdirected masochist who is working towards his own destruction. The reason a person v iciously strikes out against you is beca use they are a fraid of you or what you represent, or are resentful of your happiness. They are weak, insecure, and on extremely shaky ground when you throw your curse, and they make ideal human sacrifices.

It is not so easy, though, to retrace the damaging footsteps of your antagonist and make right those practical situations he or she has made wrong. The \"ideal sacrifice\" may be e motionally insecure, but nonetheless can, in the machinations of his insecurity, cause severe damage to your tranquility or sound reputation. \"Mental ill ness\", \"nervous breakdown\", \"maladjustment\", \"anxiety neuroses\", \"broken h omes\", \"sibling rivalry\", etc., etc., ad infinitum have too long been convenient excuses for vicious and irresponsible ac tions.

Other animals, when n earing d eath, know they are a bout to die; but it is not until death is certain that t he a nimal senses his coming d eparture from this world. And even then h e does not know exactly what is entailed in dying. It is often pointed out that animals acce pt death grace fully, without fear or r esistance. This is a beautiful concept, but one that only holds true in cases where death for the animal is unavoidable. When an animal is s ick or injured he will fight for his life with every ounce of strength he has left. It is this unshakable will to live that, if man were not so \"highly evolved\", would also give him the fighting spirit he needs to stay alive. It is a well known fact t hat many people die simply beca use they give up and just don't care anymore. This is understandable if the person is very ill, with n o apparent chance for r ecovery. But this often is not the ca se. Man h as become lazy. He has learned to take the ea sy way out. Even suicide has become less repug nant to many people than any number of other sins. Religion is totally to blame for this. Death, in most religions, is touted as a great spiritual awakening - one which is prepared for throughout life. This concept is very appealing to o ne who has not had a satisfactory life; but to those who have e xperienced all the joys life has to o ffer, there is a great dread attached to dying. This is as it should be. It is this lust for life which will allow the vital person to live on after the inevitable death of his fleshly shell. History shows that men who have given their own lives in pursuit of an ideal have been deified for their martyrdom. Religionists and p olitical leaders have been v ery crafty in laying their plans. By holding the martyr up as a shining example to his fellow men, they elimi nate the c omm on sense reac tion that willful self-destruction goes against all animal logic. To the Satanist, martyrdom and non-personalized heroism i s to be a ssociated not with integrity, but with stupidity. This, of course, does not apply to the situations which involve the safety of a loved one. But to give one's own life for something as impersonal as a political or religious issue is the ultimate in masochism. Life is the one great indulgence; death the one great abstinence. To a person who is s atisfied with his earthly existence, life is like a party; and no o ne likes to leave a good party. By the same token, if a person is enjoying himself here on earth h e will not so readily give up this life for the promise of an afterlife about which he knows nothing. The Eastern mystical beliefs teac h h umans to discipline themselves against any conscious will for succe ss s o they might dessolve themselves into \"Universal Cosmic Awareness\" - anything to avoid good healthy self-satisfaction or honest pride in earthly accomplishments! It is interesting to note that t he a reas in which this type of belief f lourishes are those where material gains are not easily obtainable. For this reason the predominant religious belief must be one which comm ends its followers for their rejection of material things and their avoidance of the use of labels which attaches a ce rtain amount of importance to material gains. In this way the people can be pacified into accepting their lot, no matter how small it may be. Satanism uses many labels. If it were not for names, very few of us would u nderstand anything in life, much less attach any significance to it; - and significance c ompels recognition, which is"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51 something eve ryone wants, especially the Eastern mystic who tries to prove to everyone he ca n meditate longer or stand more deprivation and pain than the next fellow. The Eastern philosophies preac h the dissolution of man's ego before he ca n produce sins. It is unfathomable to the Satanist to conceive of an ego which would willfully choose denial of itself. In countries where this is used as a sop for the willingly impoverished, it is understandable that a philosophy which teac hes the denial of the e go would serve a useful purpose - at least for those in power, to whom i t would be detrimental if their people were discontented. But for anyone who has every opportunity for material gain, to choo se this form of religious thought seems foo lish, indeed! The Eastern mystic believes s trongly in reincarnation. To a person who has virtually nothing in this life, the possibility that he may have been a king in a past life or may be one in the next life is very attractive, and d oes much to appease his need for self-respect. If there is nothing in which they can take pride in this life, they can console themselves by thinking, \"there a re a lways future lives.\" It never occurs to the believer in reincarnation that if his father, grandfather, and g reat- grandfather, etc. had d eveloped \"goo d k armas\", by their adherence to the same beliefs and ethics as his present ones - then why is he now living in privation, rather than like a maharajah? Belief in reincarnation provides a beautiful fantasy world in which a person can find the proper avenue of ego-expression, but at t he same time c laim to have dissolved his ego. This is emphasized by the roles people choose for themselves in their past or future lives. Believers in reincarnation do not always choo se a n h onorable c haracter. If the person is of a highly respectable a nd conservative nature, he will often choo se a c olorful rogue or gangster, thereby fulfilling his alter-ego. Or, a woman who has much social status may pick a harlot or famous courtesan for the characterization of herself in a past life. If people were a ble to divorce themselves from the stigma a ttached to personal ego-fulfillm ent, they would not need to play self-dece itful games s uch as belief in reincarnation as a means of satisfying their natural need for ego-fulfillment. The Satanist believes in complete gratification of his ego. Satanism, in fact, is the only religion which advocates the intensification or encouragement of the e go. Only if a person's own ego is sufficiently fulfilled, can h e a fford to be kind and complim entary to o thers, without robbing himself of his s elf-respect. We generally think of a braggart as a person with a large e go; in reality, his bragging results from a need to satisfy his impoverished ego. Religionists have kept their followers in line by supp ressing their egos. By making their followers feel inferior, the a wesomeness of their god is insured. Satanism encourages its members to develop a goo d strong ego beca use it gives them the self-respect nece ssary for a vital existence in this life. If a person h as been v ital throughout his life a nd has fought to the e nd for his earthly existence, it is this ego which will refuse to die, even after the e xpiration of the flesh which h oused it. Young children are to be a dmired for their driving enthusiasm for life. This is exemplified by the small child who refuses to go to bed when there is s omething exciting g oing on, and when once put to bed, will sneak d own the stairs to peek through the c urtain and watch. It is this child-like vitality that will allow the Satanist t o peek through the c urtain of darkness and d eath and remain earthbound. Self-sacrifice is not encouraged by the Satanic religion. Therefore, unless death comes as an indulgence beca use of extreme c ircumstances which make the termination of life a welcome relief from the unendurable earthyl existence, suicide is frowned upon by the Satanic religion. Religious martyrs have taken their own lives, not beca use life was intolerable for them, but to use their supreme sacrifice a s a too l to further the religious belief.

This is in direct contradiction to the holy of holy days of other r eligions, which deify a particular god who has been created in an anthropomorphic form of their own image, thereby showing that the ego is not really buried. The Satanist feels: \"Why not really be honest and if you are going to create a god in your image, why not create that god as yourself.\" Every man is a god if he c hoo ses to recognize himself as one. So, the Satanist celebrates his own b irthday as the most important holiday of the year. After all, aren't you happier about the fact that you were born than you are a bout the birth of someone you have never even met? Or for that matter, aside from religious holidays, why pay higher tribute to the birthday of a president or to a date in h istory than we do to the day we were brought into this greatest of all worlds? Despite the fact t hat some of us may not have been wanted, or at least were not particularly planned, we're glad, even if no o ne e lse is, that we're here! You should g ive yourself a pat on the back, buy y ourself whatever you want, treat yourself like the king (or god) that you are, and generally celebrate your birthday with as much pomp and ceremony as possible. After one's own b irthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween (or All Hallows' Eve). St. Walpurgis - or Walpurga, or Walburga, depending up on the time a nd area in which one is referring to her - was born in Sussex about the e nd of the Seventh or the beginning of the Eighth Century, and was educated at Winburn, Dorset, where a fter taking the veil, she remained for twenty-five years. She then, at t he instance of her uncle, St. Boniface , and her brother, St. Wilibald, set out along with some other nuns to found religious houses in Germany. Her first settlement was at Bischofsheim i n the diocese of Mainz, and two years later ( 754 A.D.) she beca me a bbess of the Benedictine nunnery at Heidenheim, within h er brother Wilibald's diocese of Eichstadt in Bavaria, where a nother brother, Winebald, had at the same time a lso been made head of a monastery. On the death of Winebald in 760 she succee ded him i n h is charge, retaining the superintendence of both h ouses until her death on February 25, 779 . Her relics were translated to Eichstadt, where she was laid in a hollow rock, from which exuded a kind of bituminous oil, afterwards known as Walpurgis oil, regarded as having miraculous efficac y against disease. The cave beca me a place of pilgrimage, and a great church was built over the spot. She is comm emorated at various times, but principally on May 1st, her day taking the place of an earlier Pagan festival. Amazingly enough, all of this rigmarole was found nece ssary simply to condone the c ontinuance of the most important Pagan festival of the year - the grand clim ax of the spring equinox! The Eve of May has been memorialized as the night that all of the demons, specters, afreets, and banshees would come forth and hold their wild revels, symbolizing the fruition of the spring equinox. Halloween - All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Day - falls on October 31st or November 1st. Originally, All Hallows' Eve was one of the great fire festivals of Britain at the time of the Druids. In Scotland it was associated with the time when the spirits of the dead, the demons, witches, and sorcerers were unusually active a nd p ropitious.

The solstice a pplies to summ er and winter; the e quinox refers to autumn and spring. The summ er solstice is in June, and the winter solstice is in Dece mber. The a utumn equinox is in September, and the spring equinox is in March. Both the e quinoxes and the solstices vary a day or two from year to year, depending on the lunar cycle a t the time, but usually fall on the 21st or 22nd of the month. Five to six weeks after these days the legendary Satanic revels are celebrated."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 THE BLACK MASS N O other single device has been associated with Satanism as much as the black mass. To say that the most blasphemous of all religious ceremonies is nothing more than a literary invention is certainly a statement which n eeds qualifying - but nothing could be truer. The popular concept of the black mass is thus: a defrocked p riest stands before a n altar consisting of a nude woman, her legs s pread-eagled and vagina thrust open, eac h of her outstretched fists grasping a black candle made from the fat of unbaptized babies, and a c halice c ontaining the urine of a prostitute (or bloo d) r eposing on h er belly. An inverted cross hangs above the a ltar, and triangular hosts of ergot-laden b read or black-stained turnip are methodically blessed as the priest dutifully slips them i n and out of the a ltar-lady's labia. Then, we a re told, an invocation to Satan and various demons is followed by an array of prayers and p salms chanted backwards or interspersed with obscenities . . . all performed within the confines of a \"protective\" pentagram drawn on the floo w. If the Devil appears he is invariably in the form of a rather eager man wearing the head of a black g oat upon h is s houlders. Then follows a potpouri of f lagellation, prayer-boo k burning, cunnilingus, fellatio, and g eneral hindqu arters kissing - all done to a background of ribald recitations from the Holy Bible, and audible expectorations on the c ross! If a baby can b e slaughtered du ring the ritual, so much the better; for as everyone knows, this is the favorite sport of the Satanist! If this s ounds repug nant, then the succe ss of the reports of the black mass, in keeping the devout in church, is easy to understand. No \"dece nt\" person could fail to side with the inquisitors when told of these blasphemies. The propagandists of the c hurch did their job well, informing the public at one time or another of the heresies and heinous acts of the Pagans, Cathars, Bogomil s, Templars and others who, beca use of their dualistic philosophies and sometimes Satanic logic, had to be eradicated. The stories of unbaptized babies being stolen b y Satanists for use in the mass were not only effective propoganda measures, but also provided a c onstant source of revenue for the Church, in the form of baptism fees. No Christian mother would, upon h earing of these diabolical kidnappings, refrain from getting her child properly baptized, post haste. Another face t of man's nature was apparent in the fact that the writer or artist with lewd thoughts could exercise his most obscene predilections in the portrayal of the ac tivities of heretics. The censor who views all pornography so that he will know w hat to warn others of is the modern equivalent of the medieval chronicler of the obscene deeds of the Satanists (and, of course, their modern journalistic c ounterparts). It is believed that the most complete library of pornography in the world is owned by the Vatican! The kissing of the Devil's behind du ring the traditional black mass is easily recognized as the forerunner of the modern term used to describe one who will, through appealing to another's ego, gain materially from him. As all Satanic ce remonies were performed toward very real or material goals, the oscularum infame (or kiss of shame) was considered a symbolic requisite towards earthly, rather than spiritual, success. The usual assumption is that the Satanic ce remony or service is always called a black mass. A black mass is not the magical ceremony practiced by Satanists. The Satanist would only employ the use of a black mass as a form of psychodrama. Furthermore, a black mass does not nece ssarily imply that t he performers of such are Satanists. A black mass is essentially a parody of the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 religious s ervice of the Roman Catholic Church, but can b e loo sely applied to a satire on any religious ceremony. To the Satanist, the black mass, in its blaspheming of orthodox rites, is nothing more than a redundancy. The services of all established religions are ac tually parodies of old rituals performed by the worshippers of the ea rth and the flesh. In attempts to de-sexualize a nd d e-humanize the Pagan b eliefs, later men of spiritual faith whitewashed the honest meanings behind the rituals into the bland euphemisms now considered to be the \"true mass\". Even if the Satanist were to spend eac h n ight performing a black mass, he would no more be performing a travesty than the devout churchgoer who unwittingly attends his own \"black mass\" - his spoo f on the honest and emotionally-sound rites of Pagan antiquity. Any ceremony considered a black mass must effectively shock and outrage, as this s eems to be the measure of its s ucce ss. In the Middle Ages, blaspheming the holy church was s hocking. Now, however, the Church does not present t he a wesome image it did du ring the inquisition. The traditional black mass is no longer the outrageous s pectacle to the dilettante or r enegade priest that it once was. If the Satanist wishes to create a ritual to blaspheme a n acce pted institution, for the purpose of psychodrama, he is careful to choo se one that is not in v ogue to parody. Thus, he is truly stepping on a sacred cow. A black mass, today, would consist of the blaspheming of such \"sacred\" topics as Eastern mysticism, psychiatry, the psychedelic movement, ultra-liberalism, etc. Patriotism would be championed, drugs and their gurus would be defiled, acultural mili tants would be deified, and the decadence of ecclesiastical theologies might even be given a Satanic boost. The Satanic magus has always been the ca talyst for the dichotomy nece ssary in molding p opular beliefs, and in this case a ce remony in the nature of a black mass may serve a far-r eac hing magical purpose. In the year 1666 , some rather interesting events occurred in France. With the death of François Mansart, the a rchitect of the trapezoid, whose geometrics were to become the prototype of the haunted house, the Palace of Versailles was being constructed, in acc ordance with h is plans. The last of the glamorous priestesses of Satan, Jeanne-Marie Bouvier ( Madame Guyon) was to be overshadowed by a shrewd opportunist and callous business-woman n amed Catharine Deshayes, otherwise known as LaVoisin. Here was an erstwhile beautician who, while dabbling in abortions and pu rveying the most efficient poisons to ladies desirous of elimi nating u nwanted husbands or lovers, found in the lurid accounts of the \"messes noir\" a proverbial brainstorm. It is s afe to say that 1666 was the year of the first \"comm ercial\" black mass! In the region south of St. Denis, which is now called LaGarenne, a great walled house was purchased by LaVoisin and fitted with dispensaries, cells, laboratories, and... a c hapel. Soo n it beca me de rigueur for royalty and lesser dillettantes to attend and p articipate in the very type of service mentioned earlier in this chapter. The organized fraud p erpetrated in these ce remonies has become indelibly marked in history as the \"true black mass\". When LaVoisin was arrested on March 13, 1679 (in the Church of Our Blessed Lady of Goo d Tidings, incidentally), the die had already been cast. The degraded activities of LaVoisin h ad stifled the majesty of Satanism for many years to come. The Satanism-for-fun-and-games fad next appeared in England in the middle 18th Century in the form of Sir Francis Dashwoo d's Order of the Medmanham Fanciscans, popularly called The Hell- Fire Club. While e limi nating the bloo d, gore, and baby-fat candles of the previous century's masses, Sir Francis managed to conduct rituals replete with goo d d irty fun, and certainly provided a c olorful and harmless form of psychodrama for many of the leading lights of the period. An interesting sideline of Sir Francis, which lends a c lue to the c lim ate of the Hell-Fire Club, was a group called the Dilettanti Club, of which he was the founder."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57 It was the 19th Century that brought a whitewashing to Satanism, in the feeble a ttempts of \"white\" magicians trying to perform \"black\" magic. This was a very paradoxical period for Satanism, with writers s uch as Baudelaire a nd Huysmans who, despite their apparent obsession with evil, seemed nice e nough fellows. The Devil developed his Luciferian personality for the public to see, and g radually evolved into a sort of drawing-roo m gentleman. This was the e ra of \"experts\" on the black arts, such as Eliphas Levi and countless trance-mediums who, with their carefully bound spirits and d emons, have a lso succee ded in b inding the minds of many who call themselves parapsychologists to this day! As far as Satanism i s concerned, the c losest outward signs of this were the neo-Pagan rites conducted by MacGregor Mathers' Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Aleister Crowley's later Order of the Silver Star ( A. . . A. . . - Argentinum Astrum) and Order of Oriental Templars (O.T.O.), which paranoiaca lly denied any association with Satanism, despite Crowley's s elf- imposed image of the beast of revelation. Aside from some rather charming p oetry and a smattering of magical bric-a-brac, when n ot clim bing mountains Crowley spent most of his time a s a poseur par excellence a nd worked overtime to be wicked. Like his contemporary, Rev.(?) Mantague Summ ers, Crowley obviously spent a large part of his life with h is tongue jamm ed firmly into his cheek, but his followers, today, are somehow able to read esoteric meaning into his every word. Perennially concurrent with these societies were the sex clubs using Satanism as a rationale - that persists today, for which tabloid newspaper writers may give thanks. If it appears that the black mass developed from a literary invention of the c hurch, to a depraved comm ercial actuality, to a psychodrama for dilettantes and iconoclasts, to an ace in the hole for popular media... then where does it fit into the true nature of Satanism - and who was practicing Satanic magic in those years beyond 1666? The a nswer to this riddle lies in another. Is the person generally considered to be a Satanist really practicing Satanism in its true sense , or rather from the point of view taken b y the opinion makers of heavenly persuasion? It has often b een said, and rightly so, that all of the boo ks about the Devil have been written b y the a gents of God. It is, therefore, quite ea sy to understand how a ce rtain breed of devil worshippers was created through the inventions of theologians. This erstwhile \"evil\" character is not nece ssarily practicing true Satanism. Nor is he a living embodiment of the element of untramm eled p ride or majesty of self which gave the post-Pagan world the churchman's definition of evil. He is instead the by-product of later and more e laborate propaganda. The pseudo-Satanist has always managed to appear throughout modern h istory, with h is black masses of varying d egrees of blasphemy; but the real Satanist is not quite so easily recognized as such. It would be a n over-simplification to say that every succe ssful m an and woman on earth is, without knowing it, a practicing Satanist; but t he thirst for earthly succe ss and its ensuing realization are ce rtainly grounds for Saint Peter turning thumbs down. If the rich man's entry into heaven seems as difficult as the ca mel's attempt to go through the e ye of a needle; if the love of money is the roo t of all evil; then we must at least assume the post powerful m en on earth to be the most Satanic. This applies to financiers, industrialists, popes, poets, dictators, and all assorted opinion-makers and field marshals of the world's activities.

It will be said, by some, that t hese instructions and p rocedures are nothing more than applied p sychology, or scientific fact, called by \"magical\" terminology - until they arrive a t a passage in the text that is \"based on n o known scientific finding\". It is for this reason that no attempt has been made to limi t the e xplanations s et forth to a set nomenclature. Magic is never totally scientifically explainable, but science has always been, at one time or another, considered magic. There is no difference between \"White\" and \"Black\" magic, except in the smug hypocrisy, guilt- ridden righteousness, and self-dece it of the \"White\" magician h imself. In the c lassical religious tradition, \"White\" magic is performed for altruistic, benevolent, and \"goo d\" purposes; while \"Black\" magic is used for self-aggrandizement, personal power, and \"evil\" purposes. No o ne on earth ever pursued occult studies, metaphysics, yoga, or any other \"white light\" concept, without ego gratification and p ersonal power as a goal. It just so happens that some people e njoy wearing hair shirts, and others prefer velvet or silk. What is pleasure to o ne, is pain to another, and the same a pplies to \"goo d\" and \"evil\". Every practitioner of witchcraft is convinced that he or she is doing the \"right\" thing. Magic falls into two categories, ritual or ceremonial, and non-ritual or manipulative. Ritual m agic consists of the performance of a formal ceremony, taking p lace , at least in part, within the confines of an area set aside for such purposes and at a specific time. Its main function is to isolate the otherwise dissipated adrenal and other emotionally induced energy, and convert it into a dynamically transmittable force. It is purely an emotional, rather than intellectual, act. Any and all intellectual activity must t ake place before the ce remony, not during it. This type of magic is sometimes known as \" GREATER MAGIC \". Non-ritual or manipulative magic, sometimes called \" LESS ER MAGIC \", consists of the wile a nd gu ile obtained through v arious devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create \"change, in acc ordance with one's will\". In olden times this would be ca lled \"fascination\", \"glamour\", or the \"evil eye\". Most of the victims of the witch trials were not witches. Often the victims were ecce ntric old women who were e ither senile or did not conform to society. Others were e xceptionally attractive women who turned the heads of the men in power, and were not responsive to their advances. The real witches were rarely executed, or even b rought to trial, as they were proficient in the a rt of enchantment and could charm the men and save their own lives. Most of the real witches were sleeping with the inquisitors. This is the origin of the word \"glamour\". The a ntiquated meaning of glamour is witchcraft. The most important asset to the modern witch is her ability to be a lluring, or to utilize glamour. The word \"fascination\" has a simil arly occult origin. Fascination was the term applied to the e vil eye. To fix a person's gaze , in other words, fascinate, was to curse them"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 with the e vil eye. Therefore, if a woman h ad the a bility to fascinate men, she was regarded as a witch. Learning to effectively utilize the c omm and to LOOK , is an integral part of a witch's or warlock's training.

The three methods by which the c omm and to loo k can b e acc omplished are the utilization of sex, sentiment, or wonder, or any combination of these. A witch must, hon estly , decide into which category she most naturally falls. The first category, that of sex, is s elf-evident. If a woman is attractive or sexually appealing, she should d o everything in h er power to make herself as enticing as possible, thereby using sex as her most powerful too l. Once she has gained the man's attention, by using her sex appeal, she is free to manipulate him to her will. The second category is s entiment. Usually older woman fit into this category. This would include the \"coo kie lady\" type witch, who might live in a little c ottage, and be thought of by people a s being a bit ecce ntric. Children are usually enchanted by the fantasy that this type of witch can provide for them, and young adults s eek her out for her sage-like a dvice. Through their innocence, children can recognize her magical power. By conforming to an image of the sweet little old lady next doo r, she ca n employ the a rt of misdirection to acc omplish h er goals. The third category is the wonder theme. This category would apply to the woman who is s trange or awesome in h er appearance. By making her strange appearance work for her, she ca n manipulate people simply becuase they are fearful of the consequences should they not do as she asks. Many women fit into more than one of these ca tegories. For example, the young g irl who has an appearance of freshness and innocence, but at the same time is very sexy, combines s ex appeal with sinister overtones, uses s ex and wonder. After evaluating her assets, eac h witch must decide into which category or combination of categories s he fits, and then utilize these a ssets in their proper form. To be a succe ssful warlock, a man must simil arly fit himself into the proper category. The handsome or sexually appealing man would, naturally, fit into the first category - sex. The second, or sentiment category would apply to the older man who has, perhaps, an elfin or forest wizard appearance. The sweet old g randpa (often a dirty old man!) would also be in the sentiment category. The third type would be the man who presents a sinister or diabolic a ppearance. Each of these men would apply his particular brand of the c omm and to loo k, in much the same way as the women previously described. Visual im agery utilized for emotional reac tion is certainly the most important device incorporated in the practice of lesser magic. Anyone who is foo lish enough to say \"loo ks don't mean a thing\" is indeed deluded. Good looks are unnecessary, but \"looks\" certainly are needed! Odor is another important manipulative factor in lesser magic. Remember, animals fear and distrust anyone or anything that doesn't smell! And even though we may, as human animals, deny many of the judg ments based on this s ense c onsciously, we still are motivated by our sense of smell just as s urely as any all-fours animal. If you are a man, and wish to enchant a woman, allow the natural secretions of your body to pervade the a tmosphere imm ediately around you, and work in animalistic c ontrast to the vestments of social politeness that you wear upon your back. If you, as a woman, wish to bewitch a man, do not fear that you might \"offend\" simply beca use the oils and fragrances of your flesh h ave not been scrubbed away, or that place between your thighs is not dry and sterile. These natural odors are the sexual stimulants which n ature, in h er magical wisdom, has provided. The sentiment stimulants are those odors that will appeal to pleasant memories and nostalgia. The enchanting of a man, through h is s tomach, is first established by the smell of coo king! A \"sentiment\" type of witch will find this one of the most useful of all charms.

Each of these c orrespond to a basic human emotion. The first of these we shall call a sex ritual. A sex ritual is what is comm only known as a love c harm or spell. The purpose in performing such a ritual is to create desire on the part of the person whom you d esire, or to summ on a sex partner to fulfill your desires. If you have no specific person or type of person in mind strong enough to cause direct sexual feeling culmi nating in orgasm, you will not succee d in performing as s ucce ssfull working. The reason for this is that even if the ritual was s ucce ssful, by acc ident, what goo d would it serve if you could not take advantage of your eventual opportunity beca use of lack of stimulation or desire? It is easy to confuse enchantment for your ulterior motives, with spell-casting to satisfy your sexual desires. Enchantment for self-aggrandizement, when acc ompanied by ceremonial m agic, falls into the category of either the c ompassion or the destruction ritual, or possibly both. If you want or need something so badly y ou are sad or feel m uch anguish without it, without causing hurt on another's part, then this would incorporate a compassion ritual to increase your power. If you wish to enchant or entrap a deserving victim for your own purposes, you would employ a destruction ritual. These formulas are to be a dhered to, as applying the wrong type of ritual towards a desired result can lead to trouble of a complicated nature. A goo d example of this is the girl who finds herself plagued by a relentless s uitor. If she has done little to encourage him, then she should recognize him for the psychic vampire he is, and let him play his masochistic role. If, however, she has enchanted him frivolously, giving him every encouragement and then finds herself a steady object of sexual desire, much to her dismay, she has no o ne to blame but herself. Such exercises are only ego boo sts, borne of an indoctrination of ego denial which makes these little bewitchments nece ssary. The Satanist has enough ego strength to use e nchantments for her own sexual gratification, or to gain power or succe ss of a specific nature. The second type of ritual is of a c ompassionate nature. The c ompassion, or sentiment, ritual is performed for the purpose of helping others, or helping oneself. Health, domestic happiness, business activities, material succe ss, and scholastic prowess are but a few of the situations covered in a c ompassion ritual. It might be said that this form of ceremony could fall i nto the realm of genuine charity, bearing in mind that \"charity begins at home\". The third motivating force is that of destruction. This is a ce remony used for anger, annoyance, disdain, contempt, or just plain hate. It is known as a hex, curse, or destroying agent. One of the greatest of all fallacies about the practice of ritual m agic is the notion that one must believe in the powers of magic before one ca n b e harmed or destroyed by them. Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the most rece ptive victims of curses have a lways been the greatest scoffers. The reason is frighteningly simple. The uncivilized tribesman is the first to run to his nearest witch-doctor or shaman when h e feels a c urse has been place d up on h im by an enemy. The threat and p resence of harm i s with h im consciously, and belief in the power of the c urse is s o strong that he will take e very preca ution against it. Thus, through the a pplication of sympathetic"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 magic, he will counteract any harm that might come his way. This man is watching his s tep, and not taking any chances. On the other hand, the \"enlightened\" man, who doesn't place a ny stock in such \"superstition\", relegates his instinctive fear of the c urse to his unconscious, thereby nourishing it into a phenominally destructive force that will m ultiply with eac h succee ding misfortune. Of course, every time a new setback occurs, the non-believer will automatically deny any connection with the curse, especially to himself. The e mphatic c onscious denial of the potential of the c urse is the very ingredient that will create its s ucce ss, through setting-up of acc ident prone situations. In many instances, the victim will deny any magical significance to his fate, even unto his dying g asp - although the magician is perfectly satisfied, so long as his desired results occur. It must be remembered that it matters not whether anyone attaches any significance to your working, so long a s the results of the working a re in a ccordan ce with your will . The super-logician will always explain the connection of the magical ritual to the end result as \"coincidence\". Whether magic is performed for constructive or destructive purposes, the succe ss of the operation is dependent on the rece ptivity of the person who is to rece ive the blessing or curse, as the ca se may be. In the ca se of a sex or compassion ritual, it helps if the recipient has faith and believes in magic, but the victim of a hex or curse is much more prone to destruction if he DO ES NO T believe in it! So long as man knows the meaning of fear, he will need the ways and means to defend himself against his fears. No o ne knows everything, and as long as there is wonder, there will always be a n apprehension of the unknown, where there a re potentially dangerous forces. It is this natural fear of the unknown, a first cousin to the fascination towards the unknown, that impels the man of logic towards his very explanations. Obviously, the man of science is motivated to discovery by his very sense of wonder. And yet, how sad that this man who calls himself logical is often the last to recognize the essence of ritual magic. If religious faith can make bleeding wounds appear on the body in approximation to the wounds supp osedly inflicted on Christ, it is called stigmata. These wounds appear as a result of compassion driven to an emotionally violent extreme. Why, then, should there be a ny doubt as to the destructive e xtremes of fear and terror. The so-called d emons have the power to destroy in a flesh rending manner, theoretically, as much as a handful of nails, long rusted away, can create blood-dripping ecstasy in a person convinced he is hooked upon the cross of Calvary. Therefore, never attempt to convince the skeptic upon whom you wish to place a c urse. Allow him to scoff. To enlighten h im would lessen your chance of succe ss. Listen with b enign assurance as he laughs at your magic, knowing his days are filled with turmoil all the while. If he is despicable enough, by Satan's grace, he might even die - laughing! A WORD OF WARNING! TO THOSE WHO WOULD PRACTICE THESE ARTS - Concerning Sex or Lust: Take full advantage of spells and charms that work; if you be a man, plunge your erect member into her with lascivious delight; if you be a woman, open wide your loins in lewd anticipation. Concerning Compassion: Be resolved that you'll have no regrets at the expense of the help that you have given others, should their new-found blessings place an obstacle in your path. Be grateful for things that come to you through the use of magic."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 Concerning Destruction: Be certain you DO NOT care if the intended victim lives or dies, before you throw your curse, and having caused their destruction, revel, rather than feel remorse. HEED WELL THESE RULES - OR IN EACH CASE YOU WILL SEE A REVERSAL OF YOUR DESIRES WHICH WILL HARM, RATHER THAN HELP, YOU!"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 THE RITUAL, OR \"INTELLECTUAL DECOMPRESSION\", CHAMBER A MAGICAL ceremony may be performed by oneself or in a group, but t he advantages of each should be made clear. A group ritual is certainly much more of a reinforcement of faith, and an instillation of power, than is a private ce remony. The massing together of persons who are dedicated to a c omm on philosophy is bound to insure a renewal of confidence in the power of magic. The pageantry of religion consistently becomes a solitary situation it reaches into that realm of self-denail which runs concurrent with anti-social behavior. It is for this reason that the Satanist should attempt to seek out others with whom to engage in these ceremonies. In the ca se of a c urse or destruction ritual, it sometimes helps the magician if his desires are intensified by other members of the group. There is nothing in this type of ceremony which would lead to embarrassment on the part of those c onducting a ritual of this s ort, since a nger and the symbolic destruction of the intended victim are the essential ingredients. On the other hand, a c ompassion ritual, with its unashamed shedding of tears, or a sex ritual, with its masturbatory and orgasmic overtones, would most likely succeed best if privately performed. There is no place for self-consciousness in the ritual chamber, unless that very self-consciousness is an integral part of the role being p layed, and can b e used to goo d advantage - i.e.: the shame felt by a prudent woman serving as an altar, who, through h er embarrassment, feels s exual stimulation. Even in a totally personalized ritual, however, the standardized p relimi nary invocations and devices s hould be e mployed before the intimate fantasies and acting out occur. The formal part of the ritual can b e performed in the same roo m or chamber as the personalized working - or, the formal ceremony in one place , the personal in another. The beginning and end of the ritual m ust be c onducted within the c onfines of the ritual chamber containing the symbolic devices (altar, chalice, etc.). The formalized beginning and end of the ce remony acts as a dogmatic, anti-intellectual device, the purpose of which is to disassociate the ac tivities and frame of reference of the outside world from that of the ritual chamber, where the whole will m ust be e mployed. This face t of the ce remony is most important to the intellectual, as he especially requires the \"decompression chamber\" effect of the c hants, bells, candles, and other trappings, before he ca n put his pure a nd willful desires to work for himself, in the projection and utilization of his imagery. The \"intellectual decompression chamber\" of the Satanic temple might be c onsidered a training schoo l for temporary ignorance, as are ALL religious s ervices! The difference is that the Satanist KNO WS he is practicing a form of contrived ignorance in order to expand his will, whereas another religionist doesn't - or if he does know, he practices that form of self-dece it which forbids s uch recognition. His ego is already too shaky from his religious inculcation to allow himself to admit to such a thing as self-imposed ignorance!"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC A. Desire T HE first ingredient in the performance of a ritual is desire, otherwise known as motivation, temptation, or emotional persuasion. If you d o not truly desire a ny end result, you should not attempt to perform a working. There is no such thing as a \"practice\" working, and the only way that a magician could d o \"tricks\" such as moving inanimate objects, would be to have a strong emotional need to do so. It is true that if the magician wishes to gain power through impressing others with h is feats of magic, he must produce tangible proo f of his ability. The Satanic c oncept of magic, however, fails to find g ratification in the proving of magical prowess. The Satanist performs his ritual to insure the outcome of his desires, and he would not waste his time nor force of will on something so inconclusive a s folling a pencil off a table, etc. through the application of magic. The a mount of energy needed to levitate a teac up (genuinely) would be of sufficient force to place a n idea in a group of people's heads half-way across the ea rth, in turn, motivating them i n acc ordance with your will. The Satanist knows that even if you succee ded in lifting the teac up from the table, it would be a ssumed that trickery was used anyway. Therefore, if the Satanist wants to float objects in mid-air, he uses wires, mirrors, or other devices, and saves his force for self-aggrandizement. All \"gifted\" mediums and white-light mystics practice pure a nd applied stage magic, with their blindfolds and sealed envelopes, and any fairly competent stage magician, carnival worker, or lodge-hall entertainer can dup licate the same e ffect - although lacking, perhaps, the sanctimonious \"spiritual\" overtones. A little c hild learns that if he wishes for something hard enough, it will come true. This is meaningful. Wishing indicates desire, whereas prayer is acc ompanied by apprehension. Scripture has twisted d esire into lust, covetousness, and g reed. Be a s a c hild, and d o not stifle desire, lest you lose touch with the first ingredient in the performance of magic. Be led into temptation, and take that which tempts, whenever you can!"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC B. Timing I N every succe ssful situation, one of the most important ingredients is the proper timi ng. In the performance of a magical ritual, timi ng can mean succe ss or failure to an even greater extent. The best time to cast your spell or charm, hex or curse, is when your target is at his most rece ptive state. Rece ptivity to the will of the magician is assured when the recipient is as passive a s possible. No matter how strong-willed one is, he is naturally passive while he is asleep; therefore, the best time to throw your magical energy towards your target is when he or she sleeps. There a re ce rtain periods of the sleep cycle that are better than others for susceptibility to o utside influences. When a person is normally fatigued from a day's activities, he will \"sleep like a log\" until his mind and body are rested. This period of profound sleep u sually lasts about four to six hours, after which the period of \"dream sleep\" occurs which lasts two o r three hours, or until awakening. It is during this \"dream sleep\" that t he mind is most rece ptive to o utside or unconscious influence. Let us assume the magician wishes to cast a spell on a person who would u sually retire a t 11 o'clock in the e vening, and rise a t 7 o'clock in the morning. The most effective time to perform a ritual would be about 5 o'clock in the morning, or two hours before the recipient awakens. It is to be e mphasized that the magician must be a t his peak of efficiency, as he represents the \"sending\" factor when h e performs his ritual. Traditionally speaking, witches and sorcerers are night people, and u nderstandably so. What better schedule on which to live, for the sending of thoughts towards unsuspecting sleepers! If only people were a ware of the thoughts injected into their minds while they slept! The dream state is the birthplace of much of the future. Great thoughts are manifest upon awakening, and the mind that retains, in conscious form, these thoughts, shall produce much. But he who is guided by thoughts unrecognized is led into situations that will later be interpreted as \"fate\", \"God's will\", or accident. There a re other times in eac h person's day that lend themselves to the rece iving of the will of the wizard. Those times when day-dreaming or boredom ensue, or when time hangs heavy, are fertile periods of suggestibility. If a woman is the target for your spell, do not forget the importance of the menstrual cycle. If man were not dulled through h is s tifling evolutionary development, he would k now, as an all-fours animal knows, when the female was most sexually inclined. Man's s nout, however unsullied by cheap opiates, is not normally equipped to ferret out such tell-tale e rotic scents. Even if he were so endowed with such olfactory powers, the object of his quest would most likely \"throw him off the scent\" through the use of massive doses of perfumery to cover and smother the \"offending\" effluvium, or eliminate detection completely, by the astringent action of powerful deodorants. Despite these discouraging factors, man is s till m otivated to desire or be repelled, as the ca se may be, by his unconscious recognition of the c hange in woman's body chemistry. This is acc omplished in the form of a sensory cue, which is olfactory in its nature. To go backwards, in what would amount to a return to the a ll-fours animal, would seem to be the best exercise for the c onscious application of these powers, but to the squeamish might smack of lycanthropy. There is, however,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69 an easier way, and that is to simply ascertain the dates and frequency of the menstrual cycle of the woman who is your target. It is imm ediately before a nd after the period itself that the a verage woman is most sexually approachable. Therefore, the magician will find the sleep p eriod du ring these times most effective for the instillation of thoughts or motivations of a sexual nature. Witches and sorceresses have a much greater range of time in which to cast their spells toward the men of their choice. Becuase man is more c onsistent in h is s exual drives than woman (although there a re many women with equal or even greater lusts), day to day timi ng is not as important. Any man who is not already drained of all sexual energy is a \"sitting du ck\" for the proficient witch. The time of the year following the spring equinox is the most fraught with sexual vigor in a man, and he a sserts himself acc ordingly; but the witch, in turn, must work her magic stronger, as she will find his eyes will stray. Should the fearful ask, \"Is there no defense a gainst such witchery?\" it must be a nswered thus - \"Yes, there is protection. You must never sleep, never daydream, never be without a vital thought, and never have an open mind. Then you shall be protected from the forces of magic.\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC C. Imagery T HE adolescent boy who takes great care in carving, on a tree, a heart containing his and his love object's initials; the little c hap who sits by the hour drawing his conception of sleek automobiles; the tiny girl who rocks a scuffed and ragged d oll i n her arms, and thinks of it as her beautiful li ttle baby - these ca pable witches and warlocks, these natural m agicians, are e mploying the magical ingredient known as imagery, and the success of any ritual depends on it. Children, not knowing or caring if they possess artistic skill or other creative talents, pursue their goals through the use of imagery of their own manufacture, whereas \"civilized\" adults are much more c ritical of their own creative e fforts. This is why a \"primi tive\" magician can utilize a mud d oll or crude drawing to succe ssful advantage in h is magical ceremonies. To HIM , the image is as accurate as needs be. Anything which serves to intensify the e motions during a ritual will contribute to its s ucce ss. Any drawing, painting, sculpture, writing, photograph, article of clothing, scent, sound, music, tableau, or contrived situation that can be incorporated into the ceremony will serve the sorcerer well. Imagery is a c onstant reminder, an intellect-saving d evice, a working substitute for the real thing. Imagery can b e manipulated, set up, modified, and created, all acc ording to the will of the magician, and the very blueprint that is created by imagery becomes the formula which leads to reality. If you wish to enjoy sexual pleasures with the one of your choice, you must create the situation you d esire on paper, canvas, by the written word, etc., in as overstated a way as possible, as an integral part of the ceremony. If you have material desires, you must gaze upon images of them - surround yourself with the smells and sounds conducive to them - create a lodestone which will attract the situation or thing that you wish! To insure the destruction of an enemy, you must destroy them by proxy! They must be shot, stabbed, sickened, burned, smashed, drowned, or rent in the most vividly convincing manner! It is easy to see why the religions of the right-hand p ath frown upon the c reation of \"graven images\". The imagery used by the sorcerer is a working mechanism for material reality, which is totally opposed to esoteric spirituality. A Greek g entleman of magical persuasion once wanted a woman who would satisfy his every desire, and so o bsessed with the unfound object of his dreams was he, that he went about constructing such a wonderful creature. His work completed, he fell so convincingly and irrevocably in love with the woman h e had created that she was no longer stone, but mortal flesh, and alive a nd warm; and so the magus, Pygmalion, rece ived the greatest of magical benedictions, and the beautiful Galatea was his."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71 THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC D. Direction O NE of the most overloo ked ingredients in the working of magic is the accumulation and subsequent direction of force toward an effective end. Altogether too many would-be witches and warlocks will perform a ritual, and then go about with tremendous anxiety waiting for the first sign of a succe ssful working. For all i ntent and pu rpose, they might as well get down on their knees and p ray, for their very anxiety in waiting for the desired results only nullifies any real chance of succe ss. Furthermore, with this attitude, it is doubtful that enough concentrated energy to even perform a proper ceremony could be stored up in the first place. To dwell upon or constantly complain about the situation upon which your ritual would be based only guarantees the weakening of what should be ritualistically directed force, by spreading it thin and d iluting it. Once the desire has been established strongly enough to employ the forces of magic, then every attempt must be made to symbolically give vent t o these wishes IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RITUAL - NOT before or after! The purpose of the ritual is to FREE the magician from thoughts that would consume him, were he to dwell upon them constantly. Contemplation, daydreaming and constant scheming burns up emotional energy that could be gathered together in a dynamically usable force; not to mention the fact that normal productivity is severely depleted by such consuming anxiety. The witch who casts her spells between long waits by the telephone, anticipating her would-be lover's call; the destitute warlock who invokes Satan's blessing, then waits on pins and needles for the c heck to arrive; the man, saddened by the injustices wrought upon h im, who, having cursed his enemy, plods his way, long of f ace , and forrowed of brow - all are c omm on examples of misdirected emotional energy.

The Balance Factor T HE Balance Factor is an ingredient employed in the practice of ritual m agic which applies to the ca sting of lust and compassion rituals more than in the throwing of a curse. This ingredient is a small, but extremely important one. A complete knowledge a nd awareness of this factor is an ability few w itches and warlocks ever attain. This is, simply, knowing the proper type of individual and situation to work your magic on for the ea siest and best results. Knowing one's own limi tations is a rather odd bit of introspection, it would seem, for a person who should be a ble to perform the impossible; but under many conditions it can make the difference between success and failure. If, in attempting to attain your goal through either greater or lesser magic, you find yourself failing consistently, think about these things: Have you been the victim of a misdirected, over- blown ego which h as caused you to want something or someone when the c hances are virtually non-existent? Are you a talentless, tone-deaf individual who is attempting, through magic, to rece ive great acc laim for your unmusical voice? Are you a plain, glamorless witch with oversized feet, nose, and ego, combined with an advanced case of acne, who is casting love spells to catch a handsome young movie star? Are you a gross, lumpy, lewd-mouthed, snaggle-too thed loafer who is desirous of a luscious young stripper? If so, you'd better learn to use the balance factor, or else expect to fail consistently! To be a ble to adjust one's wants to o ne's capabilities is a great talent, and too many people fail to realize that if they are unable to attain the maximum, \"a half a loaf can be better than n one\". The chronic loser is always the man who, having nothing, if unable to make a milli on dollars, will reject any chance to make fifty thousand with a disgruntled sneer. One of the magician's greatest weapons is knowing himself; his talents, abilities, physical attractions and d etractions, etc., and when, where, and with whom to utilize them!

DEVICES USED IN A SATANIC RITUAL CLOTHING Black robes are worn b y the male participants. The robes may be c owled or hoo ded, and if desired may cover the face . The purpose in covering the face is to allow the participant freedom to express emotion in the face , without concern. It also lessens distraction on the part of one participant towards another. Female participants wear garments which are sexually sugg estive; or all black clothing for older women. Amulets bearing the sigil of Baphomet or the traditional pentagram of Satan are worn by all participants. Robes are donned by men b efore e ntering the ritual chamber, and are worn throughout the ritual. Men may substitute all black clothing for black robes. Black is chosen for the a ttire in the ritual chamber beca use it is s ymbolic of the Powers of Darkness. Sexually appealing clothing is worn b y women for the purpose of stimulating the emotions of the male participants, and thereby intensifying the outpouring of adrenal or bio- electrical energy which will insure a more powerful working. ALTAR Man's earliest altars were living flesh and bloo d; and man's natural instincts and p redilictions were the foundation on which h is religions were based. Later r eligions, in making man's natural inclinations sinful, perverted his living altars into slabs of stone and lumps of metal. Satanism i s a religion of the flesh, rather than of the spirit; therefore, an altar of flesh is used in Satanic ce remonies. The purpose of an altar is to serve a s a focal point towards which all attention is focused du ring a ce remony. A nude woman is used as the a ltar in Satanic rituals beca use woman is the natural passive receptor, and represents the earth mother. In some rituals nudity for the woman serving as altar may be impractical, so she may be c lothed or partially covered. If a female is performing the ritual alone, no woman n eed be used for the a ltar. If no female is used for the a ltar, the e levated p lane used for her to lie upon may be used to hold other devices for the ritual. For large group rituals a trapezoidal altar about 3 to 4 feet high and 5½ to 6 feet long can b e specially constructed for the woman to lie upon. If this is impractical, or in private ce remonies, any elevated p lane may be used. If a woman is used for the a ltar, the other devices may be placed upon a table within easy reach of the priest. SYMBOL OF BAPHOMET The symbol of Baphomet was used by the Knights Templar to represent Satan. Through the a ges this s ymbol has been called by many different names. Among these a re: The Goat of Mendes, The"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 Goat of a Thousand Young, The Black Goat, The Judas Goat, and p erhaps the most appropriately, The Scapegoat. Baphomet represents the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the goat. In its \"pure\" form the pentagram i s s hown encompassing the figure of a man in the five points of the star - three points up, two pointing d own - symbolizing man's s piritual nature. In Satanism the pentagram i s also used, but since Satanism represents the ca rnal instincts of man, or the opposite of spiritual nature, the pentagram i s inverted to perfectly acc omodate the head of the goat - its horns, representing du ality, thrust upwards in defiance; the other three points inverted, or the trinity denied. The Hebraic figures around the outer circle of the symbol which stem from the magical teac hings of the Kabala, spell out \"Leviathan\", the serpent of the watery abyss, and identified with Satan. These figures correspond to the five points of the inverted star. The symbol of Baphomet is placed on the wall above the altar. CANDLES The ca ndles used in Satanic ritual represent t he light of Lucifer - the bearer of light, enlightenment, the living flame, burning desire, and the Flames of the Pit. Only black and white ca ndles are to be used in Satanic ritual. Never use more than one white candle; but as many black candles as are required to illuminate the ritual chamber may be used. At least one black candle is place d to the left of the a ltar, representing the Powers of Darkness and the left-hand p ath. Other black candles are place d where needed for illumination. One white candle is place d to the right of the a ltar, representing the hypocrisy of white light \"magicians\" and the followers of the right-hand path. No other light source is to be used. Black candles are used for power and succe ss for the participants of the ritual, and are used to consume the parchments on which b lessings requested by the ritual participants are written. The white ca ndle is used for destruction of enemies. Parchments upon which curses are written are burned in the flame of the white candle. BELL The shattering effect of the bell i s used to mark both the beginning and the e nd of the ritual. The priest rings the bell nine times, turning counter clockwise a nd d irecting the tolling towards the four cardinal points of the c ompass. This is done once a t the beginning of the ritual to clear and purify the a ir of all external sounds, and once a gain at the e nd of the ritual to intensify the working and act as a pollutionary indicating finality. The tonal quality of the bell used should be loud and penetrating, rather than soft and tinkling. CHALICE In Satanic ritual the c halice or goblet used represents the Chalice of Ecstasy. Ideally, the c halice should be made of silver, but if a silver chalice ca n n ot be obtained, one made from another metal, glass, or crockery may be used - anything bu t gold . Gold has always been associated with white- light religions and the Heavenly Realm. The c halice is to be drunk from first by the priest, then b y one a ssistant. In private rituals the person performing the ceremony drains the chalice. ELIXIR"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79 The stimulating fluid or Elixir of Life used by the Pagans has been corrupted into sacramental wine by the Christian faith. Originally, the liquor used in Pagan rituals was drunk to relax and intensify the e motions of those involved in the ce remony. Satanism does not sacrifice its god, as do o ther r eligions. The Satanist practices no such form of symbolic ca nnibalism, and returns the sacramental wine used by the Christians to its original purpose - that of stimulating the e motions nece ssary to Satanic ritual. Wine itself need not be used - whatever drink is most stimulating and pleasing to the palate is in order. The Elixir of Life is to be drunk from the Chalice of Ecstasy, as indicated above, imm ediately following the Invocation to Satan. SWORD The Sword of Power is s ymbolic of aggressive force, and acts as an extension and intensifier of the a rm with which the priest uses to gesture a nd p oint. A parallel to this is the pointing stick or blasting wand used in other forms of magical ritual. The sword is held by the priest and is used to point towards the symbol of Baphomet during the Invocation to Satan. It is also used, as indicated in Steps of Ritual , when calling forth the four Princes of Hell. The priest thrusts the point of the sword through the parchment containing the message or r equest after it has been read aloud; it is then used to hold the parchment while introduced into the ca ndle flame. While hearing the requests of other participants, and while repeating same, the priest places the sword atop their heads (in traditional \"knighting\" fashion). For private rituals, if a sword cannot be obtained, a long knife, cane, or similar staff may be used. PHALLUS The phallus is a Pagan fertility symbol which represents generation, virility, and aggresion. This is yet another device which h as been b lasphemously converted to fit the guild-ridden ceremonies of Christianity. The phallus is a non-hypocritical version of the a spergillim , or \"holy water sprinkler\" used in Catholicism - quite a metamorphosis of the common penis! The phallus is held in b oth h ands of one of the priest's assistants, and methodically shaken twice towards each cardinal point of the compass, for the benediction of the house. Any phallic symbol m ay be used. If none is obtainable one may be made from plaster, woo d, clay, wax, etc. The phallus is necessary only in organized group rituals. GONG The gong is used to call upon the forces of Darkness. It is to be struck once a fter the participants have repeated the priest's words, \"Hail Satan!\". A gong is nece ssary only in organized g roup rituals. For the best tonal quality a c oncert gong is preferred, but if one ca nnot be obtained any gong with a full, rich tone may be used. PARCHMENT Parchment is used beca use its organic properties are c ompatible with the e lements of nature. In keeping with the Satanic views on sacrifice, the parchment used would be made from the skin of a sheep which was, by nece ssity, killed for foo d. An animal is neve r slaughtered for the purpose of using all or a part of that animal in a Satanic ritual. If comm erical parchment which h as been made from already slaughtered sheep cannot be obtained, plain paper may be substituted."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 The parchment is the means by which the written message or r equest can b e c onsumed by the candle flame a nd sent out into the e ther.

If the magical ceremony is to employ all sensory awarenesses, then the proper sounds must be invoked. It is certainly true that \"actons speak louder than words\", but words become as monuments to thoughts. Perhaps the most noticea ble shortcoming in the printed magical conjurations of the past is the lack of emotion developed up on the reciting of them. An old wizard k nown to the a uthor, who was once e mploying a self-composed invocation of great personal m eaning in the light of his magical desires, ran out of words just as his ritual was moments s hort of its s ucce ssful culmi nation. Aware of the nece ssity of keeping his emotional response generating, he quickly adlibbed the first emotion-provoking words that came to mind - a few stanzas of a poem by Rudyard Kipling! Thus, with this final burst of glory-charged adrenalin, was he able to finalize an effective working!

It resembles Arabic in some sounds and Hebrew and Latin in others. It first appeared in print in 1659 in a biography of John Dee, the famous Sixteenth Century seer and court astrologer. This work, by Meric Casaubon, describes the occultist Dee's activities with his associate, Edward Kelly, in the art of scrying or crystal gazing. Instead of the usual crystal ball, Kelly, who was the gaze r, used a many-face ted trapezohedron. The \"angels\" referred to in Kelly's first revelation of the Enochian Keys, obtained through the windows of the c rystal, are only \"angels\" beca use occultists to this day have lain ill with metaphysical constipation. Now the c rystal clears, and the \"angels\" are seen as \"angles\" and the windows to the fourth dimension are thrown open - and to the frightened, the Gates of Hell. I have presented my translation of the following calls with an archaic but Satanically correct unvarnishing of the translation employed by the Order of the Golden Dawn in the late Nineteenth Century. In Enochian the meaning of the words, combined with the quality of the words, unite to create a pattern of sound which can cause tremendous reac tion in the a tmosphere. The barbaric tonal qualities of this language give it a truly magical effect which cannot be described. For many y ears the Enochian Keys, or Calls, have been shrouded in secrecy. The few printings that have e xisted completely elimi nate the c orrect wording, as the proper translation h as been disguised through the use of euphemisms, and only designed to throw the inept magician and/or would-be inquisitor off the track. Apocryphal as they have become (and who can tell what grim reality provokes the \"fantasy\"), the Enochian Calls are the Satanic paea ns of f aith. Dispensing with such once-pragmatic whitewashing in terms s uch as \"holy\" and \"angelic\", and arbitrarily chosen groups of numbers, the purpose of which were only to act as s ubstitutes for \"blasphemous\" words - here, then, are the TRUE Enochian Calls, as rece ived from an unknown hand."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 THE FIRST KEY The first Enochian Key represents an initial proclamation from Satan, stating the inception of the laws of temporal theologies and of the lasting p ower which resides in those bold enough to recognize earthly beginnings and absolutes.
