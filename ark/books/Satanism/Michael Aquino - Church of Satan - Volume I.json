Having received myB.A. from theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara the previous week, I had returned to mynative city for a shortvacation before reporting to the 82nd Airborne Division as a newly-commissionedSecond Lieutenant.Leafing through the newspapers in search of an evening’s entertainment, I sawthat the highly-publicizedfilm Rosemary’s Baby was premiering at a theater in the Marina District, and Idecided to catch the earlyscreening in order to avoid the crowds arriving for the later show.The film proved to be unexpectedly disturbing - even more so than the novelwhich had appeared twoyears earlier. Unlike the formula Hollywood monster movie, it emphasized theunremarkable and ordinarypersonalities of Rosemary’s neighbors - and then revealed them to be just asroutinely engaged in bizarrepractices of Devil-worship and Black Magic. “This is no dream,” gasped aterrified Mia Farrow as she wasravished by Satan. “This is really happening!”As the lights came on, I paused to wonder - as, I am sure, did many others inthe theater - whether itcould indeed really happen. Was it possible that Satanism could still be aliving force in the world, and notmerely a historical aberration of medieval paganism and primitive anti-Catholicsentiment? No, of coursenot.But as I strolled towards the front of the theater, there was a sudden commotionout under themarquee. A late-model black hearse had drawn up to the curb, and from it thereemerged four or five menclad completely in black robes. The crowd parted before them, and the managerushered them through thelobby and into the darkened interior of the building.It all happened so quickly that I had only a momentary look at this singulardelegation, but there wasno mistaking its central figure - a tall, shaven-headed, goateed man withpiercing eyes that seemed almostreptilian in their gaze. As the crowd thinned, I walked over to the manager andasked him for anexplanation of the incident.“That was Anton LaVey,” he said after a moment’s hesitation, “and those werepeople from the Churchof Satan. LaVey was technical advisor to this film and played the part of theDevil in it.” He produced abright red calling-card, which solemnly announced:- 14 -Not only could it happen, said the card, but it was indeed happening. I shook myhead in fascination.An actual church devoted to the Devil - and right here in San Francisco!Moreover both the card and theannounced address implied that this institution had managed to sustain a publicexistence and exposure.Outré it might be, but criminal it was evidently not.Driving directly home to Russian Hill was of course quite out of the question; Idetoured half-a-cityout of my way to see what sort of structure it was that could house such abizarre activity. The addressproved to be far out in the Richmond District, where California Street ceases tobe a four-lane, commercialartery and becomes merely one more fog-shrouded residential lane. Nestledtightly between two buildings,6114 revealed itself to be a two-story, peaked-roof house of a type common inpost-fire San Francisco. Butit was painted completely black, and the three main windows were tightlyshuttered.The only indication of occupancy was the soft glow of an orange-red lightthrough the front-doortransom. I listened for some sound from the interior, but the house remainedsilent and uninviting. A plateby the door said DO NOT DISTURB UNLESS YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT, which of courseI didnot, so I drove away … and for a year almost entirely forgot about Anton SzandorLaVey and his strangeChurch of Satan.I did not know it then, but I had just received my first glimpse of both a manand an institution whowould alter my life to an extraordinary degree. More than that, they would alterthe lives and philosophiesof many other persons throughout the country and the world, and ultimately theywould be responsible fora most remarkable contribution to the options for human social evolution.For the Church of Satan was not just one more shade of color in San Francisco’srainbow of theeccentric and the avant-garde, nor did it have much in common with what mostpeople generally consider“the occult”. Rather it was an exercise in intellect, spirit, and activitywhich, accidentally or intentionally,managed to focus on the greatest mystery of mankind: why it is different fromall other forms of life, andwhat this difference implies for its potential.Such an odyssey was not to be comfortable or tranquil. During the decade of itsexistence, the Churchof Satan strained and in some cases almost shattered the lives of manyindividuals who came into contactwith it. Like some great Frankenstein monster, it fascinated and obsessed itscreators and its adherents,rewarding success in its fields of interest with stronger and darker challenges.As the institution grew larger and more sophisticated, the personalities andphilosophies that governedit came to have less and less in common with their counterparts in conventionalsociety, and ultimately theChurch came to display two distinct faces.The first face was that through which it struggled to communicate with thepublic and indeed the outercircles of its own membership. This was the Church of Satan of the tabloidnewspapers and magazines,the publicity-provoking pranks, and the Hollywood flirtations; from 1966 to 1975it would be described,denounced, praised, and caricatured by a veritable parade of reporters,academics, theologians, andhistorians.From all these accounts there gradually emerged a confusing and inconclusiveimage of the Church asa spectacular fraud. For all of its regalia, rituals, and aphorisms, it seemedtoo commercial, too media-oriented, too transparent, and indeed too “nice” to be authentic. Even some ofits more enthusiasticmembers eventually disengaged themselves with the feeling that they hadexhausted the Church; they hadwallowed in its notorious indulgences and found them to provide only temporaryrelief in the restlesssearch for stimulation, excitement, and recognition.The other face of the Church of Satan was not seen by the public, nor indeed bymost of itsmembership. It was sensed by a very few - perhaps not even by Anton LaVeyhimself - when the Churchwas founded. Ten years later it was still obscure and ethereal: a face that wasglimpsed peripherally ratherthan directly. It was the face of deep, ultimate authenticity - a signal thatbehind all the pageantry and thepyrotechnics lay an unsuspected substance - and a manifestation of intelligencethat responded, howeverunpredictably, to efforts at conscious communication.- 15 -It was just this authenticity which animated the Church and its High Priest sovibrantly for so long,enabling both to endure so much social suspicion, ostracism, and outrightantagonism without sufferingloss of dignity, much less of conviction.Like Galileo denying his discoveries before the Inquisition, Anton LaVey couldromp as a Faustiancaricature for the entertainment and reassurance of the masses both within andwithout the Church ofSatan, secure within himself that all such escapades were insignificant next tothe actual truths he haddiscovered. Under their influence, and enthralled by their energy, he would soarto unprecedented andunanticipated heights of self-awareness, control, and power. And through theirintoxication he would alsofall - an Icarus who, in the exhilaration of flight, had ventured too near theSun.Because it transpired that the Church of Satan finally disintegrated asunexpectedly as it had arrived -nine years after it first came into being. But just as its beginning was moreprecisely an evolution and ametamorphosis of a tradition which had preceded it in human history, so thattradition again did notvanish. Rather it underwent yet another change into an even more sophisticatedinstitution - the Temple ofSet.As Satanism is necessarily a reaction against the assumptions, prescriptions,and values of Judaic/Christian religion, so the Church of Satan was limited in the positive potentialof its philosophicalconceptualizations. The energy and the momentum were present, but Satanists hadimprisoned themselvesin what turned out to be a very cramped and artificial universe. They could notput a name to their growingsense of frustration until 1975, and then - in a moment of crisis as painful asit was inspiring - theircumulative efforts resulted in a dramatic transformation of their environment,from one of dependent,negative reaction to one of independent, positive action.The Temple of Set proved to be the latent, always implicit but never predefinedpromise behind theChurch of Satan - that hypothetical triumph which would follow a Satanic eclipseof the inertial forces ofthe Universe. It is a triumph still evolving cautiously towards fullrealization, but one whose parametersapproach the very limits of human potential. Indeed it presages the evolution ofthe human psyche intosomething as far removed from its present state as that state is from simpleanimal existence.This book is thus a history whose ultimate significance is to be found in thefuture which these earlierevents set in motion, not just in the adventures of those remarkable years from1966 to 1975 themselves.This Eighth Edition proceeds past 1975 into the tragic Götterdämmerung whichthereafter descendedupon Anton and the remnants of the Church, culminating in his death in 1997.Lest we be tempted tojudge him too quickly, it is well to remember that some of the same qualitiesresponsible for his downfallalso contributed in making him the genius that he was. In John Fowles’ TheMagus, the magician Conchisobserves of the eccentric, reclusive magician who had initiated him in hisyouth:Whenever I see a photograph of a teeming horde of Chinese peasants, or of somemilitary procession,whenever I see a cheap newspaper crammed with advertisements for mass-producedrubbish. Or the rubbishitself that large stores sell. Whenever I see the horrors of the pax Americana,of civilizations condemned tocentury after century of mediocrity because of over-population andunder-education, I see also de Deukans.Whenever I see lack of space and lack of grace, I think of him. One day, manymillennia from now, therewill perhaps be a world in which there are only such châteaux, or theirequivalents, and such men andwomen. And instead of their having to grow, like mushrooms, from a putrescentcompost of inequality andexploitation, they will come from an evolution as controlled and ordered as deDeukans’ tiny world atGivray-le-Duc. Apollo will reign again. And Dionysus will return to the shadowsfrom which he came.1In the chapters which follow I have endeavored not only to recount theadventures of Anton SzandorLaVey and the Church of Satan, but also to draw from these experiences theprinciples which theydiscovered, refined, and actualized. While relevant documentation is bothincorporated and appended, it1 Fowles, John, The Magus (revised version). Boston: Little, Brown, 1965, 1967,page #186.- 16 -will soon become clear that ordinary rules of evidence are sadly inadequate forsubject material as singularas this.It would be much to expect that this extraordinary story will be completelycredible or even intelligibleto the conventional mind. To sense its significance, one must undertake withinone’s own consciousnessthat same mysterious, often frightening journey on which Initiates of theLeft-Hand Path are alwaysembarked. It is a journey which may be rewarding, but to those of fragiledispositions it may just aspossibly be profoundly disturbing, even disastrous. It is a journey throughHell, but …The mind is its own place, and in itselfCan make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. 22 Satan in Milton, John, Paradise Lost.[index-17_1.jpg]- 17 -Interest in and worship of the Devil did not, of course, begin with the Churchof Satan in 1966. Themoment something like a Prince of Darkness was visualized in ancient times,presumably, someonedecided that it would be more advantageous, illuminating, or just plain fun toseek his favor instead of thatof more socially-respectable gods. Yet so strong was the grip of Christianity inmedieval Europe, and sosavage its persecution of even the mildest heresy, that anything like formalizedSatanism was quiteunthinkable.Until the 20th Century witchcraft and Devil-worship remained the stuff of moralmythology: tales toldto frighten children into behaving like good little Christians, or, moreominously, allegations among adultsfor malicious reasons. How many of the persecutions, massacres, tortures, andburnings of 15th-17thCentury Europe were actually based on anything more than cold-bloodedopportunism will never beknown for certain. The scale was appalling, with executions estimatedconservatively at 200,000 acrossthe continent.3Under such circumstances sensible people avoided any interest remotelysuggestive of witchcraft orSatanism. Curiosity concerning “occult mysteries” was indulged only beneath theheaviest veneer ofJudæo/Christian orthodoxy, from the angel-communicated “Enochian Keys” of JohnDee to the cross-splashed pageantry of Rosicrucian and Masonic fraternities. Such magical textsas were eventually studiedby aficionados were carefully attributed to ancient Hebrew sages or historicChristian authorities.4After the continental excesses and exhaustion of the Catholic-Protestant warsand the resultantreaction against all Christian institutions in favor of an “Age of Reason” or“Enlightenment” 5, the“forbidden fruit” of Satan and Satanism began to be looked at as somethingexotic to play with. HellfireClubs, including Sir Francis Dashwood’s Order of Medmenham Franciscans, werechic in London6; lurid3 Kingston, Jeremy, Witches and Witchcraft. London: Aldus Books, 1976, page #60.4 For instance the Clavicule of Solomon and the Grimoire of Pope Honorius.5 Encompassing the late 17th and the 18th Centuries, the “Enlightenment” wascharacterized by (1) a relegation of mankind to a “naturalplace”, not a privileged place among the natural order, (2) a disbelief that“God” (if he exists) would ignore natural laws to take any interest inhuman affairs, (3) a sentimental attraction to ancient Classical cultures anddistaste for the medieval Christian heritage, (4) emphasis on thepresent life as opposed to an afterlife, and (5) humanitarian respect for andkindness towards all natural creatures. One excellent introductionis The Enlightenment by Norman Hampson (Baltimore: Pelican Books, 1968).6 The definitive study of Dashwood’s Order to date is Eric Towers, Dashwood: TheMan and the Myth (London: Crucible, 1986), which offersevidence that Dashwood’s “occult” activities consisted largely of revels inhonor of Apollo & Bacchus with no overtly “Satanic” element. Inthe early 1960s the most generally-available books on Dashwood were Daniel P.Mannix’ The Hell-Fire Club (NY: Ballantine, 1959) andDonald McCormick’s The Hell-Fire Club (London: Jarrold’s, 1958). Mannix painteda sensational picture of explicitly Satanic orgies;McCormick debunked this in favor of “rakemanship” parties. Mannix’ fantasy,obviously, was the one to which the early Church of Satan wasmore inclined.- 18 -rumors of Palladists and Luciferians scandalized Paris7. By the 19th Centuryauthors such as J.K.Huysmans were shocking their readers with lurid tales of Black Masses and humansacrifices among thedecadent aristocracy. 8 In Austria and Germany ancient paganisms were revivedfrom near-extinction9,paving the way for a wild renaissance in Romanticism that would ultimately leadto the apocalyptic statetotalitarianisms of the early 20th Century. 10World War II burned that Romanticism to ashes, leaving in its place a dullsocial rationalism whoseonly claim to anything exotic in the way of philosophy was the escapist despairof Sartre and his fellowexistentialists.11 Religion had become a Norman Rockwell game for the nuclearfamily of America to playon Sunday mornings; otherwise it was as obsolete and irrelevant as thehorse-and-buggy.A few oddballs still played with the old forbidden fruit, however. In 1940William Seabrook wroteWitchcraft: Its Power in the World Today after having his curiosity aroused byhis friend AleisterCrowley. 12 In England Gerald Gardner worked to reintroduce witchcraft as anonSatanic, nature-glorifyingpaganism. 13 And finally Satanism-as-Satanism became worked into a new socialmyth by anotheracquaintance of Crowley’s, Dennis Wheatley.Wheatley, a British intelligence officer during World War II, went on after thewar to write a greatmany novels of romance and adventure, not unlike those of his wartime associateIan Fleming. 14 In one ofhis novels, The Devil Rides Out (1934), Wheatley presented a coven of eliteSatanists in London,gathering in secret mansions to conjure up frightful dæmonic entities fromcandle-lit magic circles. Whennot engaged in such monstrous ceremonies, they were the very model ofupper-class society, enjoying themost expensive cigars and wines along with their vintage Rolls-Royce andHispano-Suiza motorcars.Wheatley followed the success of The Devil Rides Out with several more novels inwhat came to becalled his “Black Magic series”. 15 In addition to the damsel-in-distress andthe good-magician-vs.-bad-7 Flowers, Stephen E.

LLHP is indispensable as ahistory not only of overtly Satanic movements, but moreimportantly of many philosophical schools of thought which conceived, developed,and preserved the key elements of this tradition over thecenturies.8 Huysmans, J.K., La-Bas (Down There). NY: Dover, 1972. A fictional account of asupposed 17th-Century Black Mass, it neverthelessbecame the standard model for such concepts among the ignorant public.9 See in particular Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism: TheAriosophists of Austria and Germany 1890-1935(Wellingborough: Aquarian Press, 1985), which profiles Guido von List’sArmanenschaft, Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels’ Order of New Templars,& Rudolf von Sebottendorf’s Thule Gesellschaft.

Flowers,Fire and Ice: Magical Teachings of the Brotherhood of Saturn,Germany’s Greatest Secret Occult Order (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1990): a detailedanalysis of the Fraternitas Saturni which dominated Germanoccultism from the 1920s.10 See in particular Peter Viereck, Metapolitics from the Romantics to Hitler(NY: Knopf, 1941). Major sections deal with Romanticism, life-worship, Kultur, dynamism, Wagner, Chamberlain, Fichte, Hegel, Rosenberg, andHitler. Beyond the exclusively German experience, seeErnst Nolte, Three Faces of Fascism (NY: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1963), whichcompares the German, French, & Italian movements.11 An excellent survey is James Collins, The Existentialists (Chicago: HenryRegnery, 1952), with major sections on Kierkegaard, Nietzsche,Husserl, Sartre, Jaspers, Marcel, & Heidigger.12 William Seabrook, Witchcraft: Its Power in the World Today (NY: Lancer,1940). Although personally a skeptic, Seabrook admitted thepsychological effectiveness of witchcraft. In his Confessions Aleister Crowleyremarked of him: “He had held an important position on theHearst papers, and his sanity and decency had revolted against so despicablydisgusting a job. He knew he was a genius, and the effect ofknowing me was to make him ashamed of himself.” (Chapter #80).13 See Francis King, Modern Ritual Magic: The Rise of Western Occultism (NY:Macmillan, 1989).14 It was Wheatley who introduced Maxwell Knight of M.I.5 (the model for IanFleming’s “M” character in the James Bond novels) toAleister Crowley. See Anthony Masters, The Man Who Was M (Oxford & NY: BasilBlackwell, 1984).15 The most famous are The Devil Rides Out, To the Devil a Daughter, TheSatanist, The Haunting of Toby Jugg, Strange Conflict, and Gateway to Hell. Ofthese the first and second titles were made into films: TDRO an excellentrendition of the book [available on DVD asHammer Collection #DV10666 on Anchor Bay] and TTDAD a confused mess.- 19 -magician characters, he added social causes which he and his readers disliked tohis Satanists’conspiracies: unrepentant Nazi masterminds, communists, British trade-unionists,and finally the racial“Black Power” movement!As there were no prominent Satanists in Britain or elsewhere upon whom Wheatleycould fashion hisvillains, he did the next best thing and modeled them after Aleister Crowley andhis A.·.A.·.. Wheatley’sSatanists duly wore Cefalu-style robes, credentialed themselves as “MagisterTempli” or “Ipsissimus”, andmade sure to chant “Do What Thou Wilt shall be the whole of the Law” whensummoning up Lucifer orone of his Elementals. Wheatley’s good-magicians were based somewhat loosely onTheosophy, whichhad outlived its turn-of-the-century rival, the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, to become London’smost prominent “good occultism”.Up to the mid-1960s, none of this really made the trip across the Atlantic toAmerica. Wheatley’snovels were unknown here, as was Crowley (with the exception of a few insulardisciples down aroundLos Angeles - Jack Parsons16 , L. Ron Hubbard17 , et al.). Even Hollywood, withan interest in scaring itscustomers, had moved smoothly from the Frankenstein, Dracula, and Wolfmanmelodramas of the 1940sto atomic-age mutants and space-critters in the 1950s, with nary a Satanist tobe seen. 18 We were simplynot interested. More important were power-politics with the Soviet Union,automobile tailfins, fluffytelevision, Googie-architecture soda shops, bullet brassieres, Davy Crockett,Jack Kennedy’s haircut,surfing, the space race, and rock & roll.As in England, Satanism would be ready to return to American consciousness onlywhen people werefeeling both glum and escapist. That happened in the mid-1960s, after Kennedywas assassinated and hissuccessor Lyndon Johnson (with a very unsexy haircut) was dragging anunenthusiastic generation,already inflamed with civil rights activism, through the Vietnam War.Yesterday’s surfers became today’s Hippies, and the girls traded in bouffanthairdos and go-go bootsfor granny dresses and love beads. In San Francisco people began to hear about astreet intersection calledHaight-Ashbury, and discover that it was much easier to trip out by sucking onan LSD-soaked sugar cubethan by suffering through Beat poetry in a smoke-choked coffee house.Michael Aquino (Sr.) and his generation grew up in the Roaring Twenties and tookadvantage of theprime of their lives to make the best of the Depression-era 1930s. Then the Warcame along and madeheroes of them all. They did, after all, win it.Michael Aquino (Jr.) was a member of the “postwar baby boom” activated by allthose sex-starvedservicemen returning from World War II. I and my fellow “boomers” grew up in thecomfortableEisenhower fifties, followed by the even more indulgent sixties. We facedtheoretical dangers like the“Red Scare” and the threat of nuclear war, but they never materialized intoanything beyond a vaguemonster-under-the-bed fantasy. Even Vietnam (“the first rock-and-roll war”) wassomething distant,transitory, and attention-optional: more an excuse for street-theatre andDylan/Baez Angst than anintrusion into the middle-American lifestyle.In between the generations of Michael Aquinos Sr. & Jr. was another, smallergeneration. They wereborn at the beginning of the Great Depression, and its curse was all they knewthroughout their childhoodyears. As teenagers they then, on the “home front”, lived through the blackcloud of the War with its16 John W. “Jack” Parsons (1914-1952) joined the O.T.O. in 1941 and wasinstrumental in introducing Crowley’s philosophy to America inthe postwar era, when he served as Master of the Agapé Lodge in Pasadena. Whilehe did not use the term “Satanism”, he habitually referredto his magical activities as “the Witchcraft” and to himself as the“Antichrist”. To this extent he moved closer to anti-Christianity thanCrowley, who - at least in his later years - considered Christianity assomething distastefully irrelevant. A selection of Parsons’ essays may befound in his Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword (Las Vegas: Falcon Press, 1989), whileJohn Symonds’ The Great Beast (London: Macdonald,1971) contains a somewhat more cynical account of the cooperation and tensionbetween Crowley and Parsons.17 The science-fiction writer and founder of Scientology.18 The definitive study of Satan and Satanic themes in film is Nikolas Schreck,The Satanic Screen: An Illustrated Guide to the Devil inCinema.

They were too young tofight in it, become heroes.Caught in the Twilight Zone between the heroes and the boomers, they wereinvisible, identityless: theBeat generation. Some cultivated their Beat-ness and wrote poetry. Some donnedblack leather jackets,combed their hair into “duck’s ass” splendor, and essayed hot rods and HarleyHogs along WhittierBoulevard as would later be immortalized in American Graffiti. Some drifted intothe film noir world oflate-40s decadence, angry, resentful, cynical. One of those was a young mannamed Howard StantonLevey.[index-21_1.jpg]- 21 -In 1971 Vincent Price starred in a film entitled The Abominable Dr. Phibes. Ittold the tale of a wealthyex-vaudevillian, Dr. Anton Phibes, who had been hideously disfigured in anaccident while rushing to theside of his injured wife. After she died during the operation meant to save her,Phibes vowed revenge onthe nine physicians and one nurse involved, and proceeded to murder them asdramatically as possible.Living alone in a grotesque, moderne mansion, Phibes broods over the embalmedcorpse of his wifeVictoria, plays tortured, thunderous compositions on an opulent,neon-illuminated theater organ, anddances to the 1930s’ music of a life-sized clockwork band with Vulnavia, adæmonic damsel brought tolife by the powers and passions of his own mind.The Abominable Dr. Phibes was intended to be horror camp with an Art Deco accent- perhaps awhimsical variation on Gaston Leroux’ Phantom of the Opera. Whether by accidentor intent, however,Phibes managed to attain a depth of nightmare beyond that of Lon Chaney’smasterpiece. While thePhantom had earnestly desired recognition of his genius by human society, Phibeshad descended to anabyss of despair and decadence where the opinions and even the existence ofother human beings hadbecome meaningless to him. One sensed that, like the central figure of AbrahamMerritt’s SevenFootprints to Satan, he was moved to action against the offending physiciansmore for the sake of his ownstimulation and amusement than for actual vengeance. In his madness andmagnificence he towered overthe policemen and detectives sent against him; to him they were no more real -and no less mechanical -than the pathetic, painted musicians of the Phibes Clockwork Wizards.While there is no reason to assume that The Abominable Dr. Phibes was adeliberate caricature ofAnton Szandor LaVey19, it might as well have been. The story of his life is oneof genius distorted by analienation so profound that it led him, step by step, into a Phibesian universewherein he defined his ownrealities. He created music, art, and literature of extraordinary powerprecisely because they were not inthe least modified to court critical approval. Unable to possess the Victoria ofhis dreams, MarilynMonroe, he enshrined her image in the wax museum of his imagination and foundfor himself a Vulnavia -not a ghost but a real woman, able to be not only Marilyn Monroe but many othercreatures for him. His19 After receiving and reading the original edition of this Church of Satan,Anton LaVey began to claim that the Phibes films were in fact a caricature ofhimself, and also that he had personally tutored Vincent Price in the role.While many years after the Phibes films Anton didmeet their director, Robert Fuest, in the process of his directing The Devil’sRain (1974), neither Fuest nor Price nor anyone else involvedwith the Phibes films ever indicated or acknowledged any Anton LaVey inspirationor involvement. After 1975 Anton also claimed that bothFuest and Devil’s Rain star Ernest Borgnine were Church of Satan members, bothof which were disproved by the Church membershiprecords.“My Dear Michael:Enjoyed your article [ Dark Deco in The Temple of Set].However, as amusing as it was to hear you waxing lyrically atlength about the significance of the decor, all much appreciated I might say,it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that this was a low-budget project designed as a vehicle for Vincent Price who, contract-wise, owedAIP three movies. Bob Fuest (ex Art Director of note) andmyself sat down over a few bottles of wine and tried to write some sense intowhat was then an appalling outline. Our motivation? Keep itlight and tongue-in-cheek. As a young designer in the industry (this was mythird or fourth film), I happened to have a passing interest in ArtNouveau/Deco at the time and a reasonable supply of reference materials to handin my library. It all just happened, so there. My best wishesto you, Brian Eatwell, Production Designer, Los Angeles (April 27, 2006)”- 22 -denunciation of social hypocrisy would draw people to him as moths to a flame,but again and again theywould seek not true freedom, but rather masochistic glorification of what theycherished as privateperversions. To each of them Anton LaVey was not a devil but a god, defininggood and evil; and hewould give to each of them the Kheft-like drug that he or she sought, bestowingthe illusion, if not thesubstance of freedom.And so finally he came to despise humanity and to relinquish any hope that hemight once havenurtured for its rescue from self-destruction. In a cellar room of his house hecreated a still-life of maleand female mannequins - positioned, dressed, and facially re-featured to portrayhumans at their most vile.And alone amidst this macabre company he would sit at the illuminated keyboardof a theater organ andsend forth the music of his love and hate and frustration and loneliness. Aone-eyed man in the country ofthe blind, he was a king whose powers of sight could be neither shared norappreciated by those abouthim, human or android. If he were indeed the personification of Satan, then hehad found his true Hell.Howard Stanton Levey, as his birth certificate reads, was born on April 11, 1930to Michael JosephLevey and Gertrude Coulton Levey of Chicago. Following the end of Prohibition,Michael was first aliquor salesman, then an automobile parts dealer, and finally a real estatebroker. Shortly after the birth ofHoward, the family moved to San Francisco.Howard’s childhood was fairly conventional until his junior year of high school,at which point hedropped out and began to explore the seamier side of society in poolhalls andgambling joints. In thisatmosphere he was first exposed to the song of the social dropout - the argumentthat corruption isuniversal and inescapable, and that the only rational course of action is toparticipate in it. Those who didnot were suckers and fools and were useful only as victims for predators.It was an outlook reassuring to outlaws and outcasts, and it carried with it acertain Nietzscheanglamor as well. It would later become a key element of the Church of Satan’selitist arrogance, but itsunderlying contempt for the dignity of the human spirit would also reinforceyoung Howard’s mistrust ofhonorable or altruistic motives. In building a refuge against the corruption ofthe outside world, he wouldfind that he was ultimately uncomfortable in the company of the uncorrupt - fortheir motives andbehavior did not fit the cynical, selfish mold in which he saw humanity cast.Anton would later claim to have joined the Clyde Beatty Circus at age 17,traveling with it untilOctober of 1947 - first as a cage boy, then as an assistant trainer of the lionsand tigers, and finally asplayer of the circus calliope. The 1947 route books of the Beatty Circus,however, list no one named“LaVey” or “Levey” in either the cages nor the band. 20In October 1947, Anton maintained, he left the circus to join the Pike AmusementPark, an oceanfrontcarnival in Long Beach, California. This was later disputed to his daughterZeena by his aunt Mabel, whosaid that Anton had continued to live in San Francisco throughout this entireperiod of his life. 21Whether or not young Howard actually worked for a circus or carnival in 1947,there is no doubt thathe did visit them and develop a fascination with their cynical, savageatmosphere.22 Superficially, ofcourse, they are places for fun and relaxation - where ordinary people can go toforget their cares andperhaps play frivolous games of chance for stuffed-toy prizes. But the very factthat people abandon theirusual inhibitions at a carnival can make them appear foolish and contemptible tothe carny operators. Theybecome “rubes” useful only for lighthearted or serious swindling.20 Wright, Lawrence, “Sympathy for the Devil”, Rolling Stone #612, September 5,1991, page #67. The 1947 route books are in the CircusWorld Museum of Baraboo, Wisconsin. Additionally several of the circus acts thatAnton claimed to have accompanied, such as theConcellos, Harold Alzana, and the Christianis, were primarily Ringling Brothersperformers.21 Zeena Schreck, interview with M.A.A., 1998.22 In The Devil’s Avenger and Secret Life of a Satanist there are photos of ayoung Howard Levey together with some circus or carnival performers, meant tosuggest that he was one of them. In none of these, however, is he (like them) inany kind of show costume. Probablythey are fan photos taken during his visits to circus performances in northernCalifornia.- 23 -Yet the act of deceiving leaves its imprint on the operator as well, luring himtowards a permanentsuspicion of appearances and a consequent social alienation - for in society oneis virtually forced to makedecisions based upon appearances in order to survive. Hence the depressing andeven morbid subcultureof the carnival: no Disneyland where the human spirit rejoices in memories ofchildhood innocence, butrather a City of Dreadful Night, where Dæmon Warders snarl at those sopresumptuous as to bring theirsouls with them through the gates.At about this time Howard became fascinated with a 1946 novel by William LindsayGresham,Nightmare Alley. As later summarized by Nikolas Schreck:Stanton Carlisle, an ambitious carny on the make, learns a few techniques for“cold reading” or “mittreading” rubes and telling them what they want to hear. Armed with a philosophyconsisting of “One in fiveis a born chump” (page #19) and “Misdirection is the whole works, honey” (page35), our hero spruceshimself up and develops his spiel. He declares himself a Reverend and impressesthe credulous by donninga clerical collar.The crooked Reverend gets hold of an old house, which he calls “the Church” ofhis controversialreligion. “With this house I can gimmick it up from cellar to attic,” (page 136)he crows, going into thespook racket with a vengeance. In the early days of the Church, the Reverendmakes a living charging fornightly lectures on esoteric topics and teaching “development classes” to hisdisciples. Topics for theselectures are cribbed from obscure books with which he assumes his audience willnot be familiar.He develops a polished, cultured manner of public speaking for his clericalactivities, while privatelyretaining the vulgar, tough-guy lingo of his carnival days. This double lifebegins to create psychic strain,and he becomes paranoid, fretting that “there could be a cabal forming againsthim in the Church.” (page154) He tires of small fry and seeks the company of “well-heeled” clientele.His mistrust of everyone ferments into a pathological misogyny, and he takes outhis fears andinsecurities on the “dames” in his life, mistreating and eventually pimpingthem. This does not prevent himfrom blaming all of his self-created misfortunes on what he sees as femaledeviousness and treachery.Eventually this hard-eyed cynic, who likes to think he’s a few steps ahead ofthe world he despises,ends up as an impoverished freak. Far from achieving the “big time” success helongs for, he spends his lastdays as a forgotten laughing stock. 23According to Zeena, her father became mesmerized by this book, deciding that hisown middle nameof “Stanton” signified a magical or psychic link between himself and “StantonCarlisle”. He proceeded topattern much of his own personality and lifestyle after the model of Carlisle,kept a poster from the TyronePower film of the novel prominently displayed in his own home, and includedauthor Gresham’s name onthe dedication page of his Satanic Bible. He named his second daughter Zeenaafter a central character inthe novel and later insisted that she name her own son after the “Stanton” inthe novel. [At that time,according to Zeena, she did not know Anton’s real middle name was also“Stanton”.]How much of Anton LaVey’s character was sincere in his own magical and religiousideas andpursuits, and how much was simply in hollow, cynical imitation of “StantonCarlisle”, can be the stuff ofendless debate. As Nikolas Schreck implies above, it is easy - and plausible -to see Anton as nothing morethan an insincere, clever opportunist who took “Carlisle” as his behavioralmodel, so much so that,consciously or not, he absorbed the character’s eventual self-destructivedestiny as well.However one could also speculate that while the influence of Nightmare Alley inAnton’s initial ideasconcerning the Church of Satan is undeniable, during its later 1970-75development he freed himself fromthat cynical stereotype and sought a greater and more honest nobility in thereligion he had brought intobeing. In that scenario, the crisis of 1975 had the effect not only ofshattering that greater aspect ofAnton’s being and philosophy, but also of returning him to “Carlisle” venalitywith an even more paranoidand cynical fixation.23 Letter, Nikolas Schreck to M.A. Aquino, September 1, 1998.- 24 -By the 1960s Anton had begun to publicly claim that towards the end of 1948 hewas supplementinghis income by playing the organ at the Mayan and Burbank burlesque theaters inLos Angeles, and at theMayan he met Marilyn Monroe. Allegedly she was stripping at the theater to earna living between motionpictures, and she and Anton enjoyed a whirlwind affair, living together for twoweeks. They separatedwhen Anton became attracted to another young woman, but they corresponded asfriends for at leastanother decade.While the only other person who could conclusively confirm or deny this account- Marilyn Monroeherself - is dead, it is highly improbable that Anton LaVey’s liaison with heractually occurred. In 1973,when Anton seemed more than usually preoccupied with thoughts about the famousactress, he and hiswife Diane were in frequent touch with Robert F. Slatzer, a long and closefriend of Marilyn’s who was inclose contact with her during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Now he was aboutto publish a biography ofher ( The Life and Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe, 1974), and Anton suggestedthat the affair might begermane. As Slatzer later stated to me:The information on the LaVey-Monroe relationship came to me directly and orallyfrom Anton, some inthe presence of his wife and the rest in the presence of our mutual friend WillFowler, son of the late andgreat writer Gene Fowler. The information told me was based upon Anton’s word,which I accepted.I never heard Marilyn mention this incident to me personally, as she had manyothers in her past, and Inever saw hard evidence (in Marilyn’s handwriting, substantiating his claim). 24Slatzer suggested that I contact Harry Lipton, Marilyn’s agent during that time.I did so, and Liptonflatly and emphatically denied that the affair could have occurred, if onlybecause all the circumstantialdetails of Anton’s account were false. Marilyn had not been behind in her rentat the Hollywood StudioClub, because Lipton had ensured that her bill was paid. As her agent he wouldhave known about anymoonlighting job she held, as well as any other address she used, and heinsisted that she neither workedas a stripper, used the pseudonym “Marion Marlow”, nor took a room at the ObanHotel in September1948. Marilyn had discussed her social and personal life frankly with him,continued Lipton, and she hadnever once mentioned meeting, much less having an affair with Anton LaVey. 25“I don’t know if Marilyn ever performed at the Mayan,” says Paul Valentine, “butI do know she wasnever one of my dancers.” In any case, he says, he operated the Mayan as alegitimate theater - it wasnever a burlesque, never a bump-and-grind. He says LaVey never worked for himeither. 26“Anton LaVey never met Marilyn Monroe,” said Edward Webber:Back then he told me that it was all a story which he had made up. Anton alwaysliked to create thingsthat he knew would interest people of the media and other people who had aninterest in the occult, inmysteries, and in celebrities. He approached me with the idea of putting thisMarilyn Monroe story out. Itold him, “Don’t even try. The media will find out that it’s a lie.”I don’t believe any part of the account. I don’t believe Marilyn ever stripped.I have known herpsychiatrist for years. I made a movie with her and Bette Davis in San Franciscocalled All About Eve. I hadlittle connections here and there with Marilyn. When she married Joe DiMaggio,for instance, Joe lived twoblocks from where I had grown up, so I already knew his niece Betty Crowe. 27“As ‘proof’ of his relationship with Monroe,” comments his daughter Zeena,“Anton later showedvisitors a copy of Monroe’s famous nude calendar inscribed ‘Dear Tony, How manytimes have you seen24 Letter, Robert F. Slatzer to M.A. Aquino, November 27, 1982.25 Conversation, Harry Lipton and M.A. Aquino, December 1, 1982.26 Wright, op.cit. , page #68.27 Webber, Edward M., interview with M.A. Aquino, June 2, 1991.- 25 -this! Love, Marilyn’. However my mother admitted to me that she forged the‘Monroe’ inscription on thatcalendar.” 28It thus appears reasonably conclusive that Anton’s account of his affair withMarilyn was whollyfictitious. For the purposes of this history, however, the important fact isthat Anton LaVey continued tosee in Marilyn Monroe the personification of his ideal woman: beautiful,intelligent, and resourceful, butessentially oriented towards being a sex object for men. Whatever else Marilyn’simage may be, it is notthat of a challenge to the masculine ego. She flaunted her sexuality as avulnerability, not as a weapon;men were not threatened by her.Another piece to the puzzle of Anton LaVey emerges: Comfortable with bruteanimals, apprehensiveand contemptuous of men, he appears to have been uncertain of women and thusreluctant to grant themthe full dignity of humanity. They were not a danger - as long as they werecontent to subordinate theirintellects to their sexuality.In 1948, while working as a freelance organist in San Francisco, Howard metCarole Lansing, thedaughter of a Wells Fargo bank executive, at “Playland at the Beach”, SanFrancisco’s amusement park. In1950 Howard and Carole were married. The following year, confronted with theprobability of beingdrafted for service in the Korean War, Anton claims that he sought escape byenrolling in courses incriminology at the City College of San Francisco. 29 In The Devil’s Avenger heexcuses his draft-dodging assimple avoidance of exploitation by the government - not a political or moralprotest.In 1952 Carole gave birth to a daughter, Karla Maritza. We are told by DA/SLOASthat in accordancewith his wife’s wish that he acquire a job more secure than that of organist forstag parties and burlesquehouses, Anton became a photographer for the San Francisco Police Department.This story also appears tobe fictitious, invented later to dramatize his professed familiarity with anddisgust for the seamy side ofhuman nature. 30 In 1955 he obtained a regular job playing the organ in the“Lost Weekend” nightclub. Healso claimed, again falsely, to be the official organist of the city of SanFrancisco. 31At this point it may be asked: If Anton LaVey were so disgusted by even thenormal spectrum ofhuman behavior, why then did he continue to plunge himself into the mostprimitive and savage of socialenvironments? Why not avoid them and cultivate the company of the educated, theintellectual, and thesophisticated? One speculates that, despite his many talents, he waspsychologically unprepared forcompetition. He was comfortable only in situations wherein his prominence orprivilege wasunquestioned, with others at an obvious disadvantage.Even the “Lost Weekend” nightclub, which continued to stand for many years at1940 Taraval, addedits testimony to this. It was not the usual piano or organ bar, where patronsgather round the instrument,lean on padded armrests, and as often as not sing a friendly song with themusician. The “Lost Weekend’s”one room was stern and symmetrical in the Art Deco of the thirties. TheWurlitzer organ was the centralfeature, raised on a dais and dominating the scene like a machine from FritzLang’s Metropolis. Theorganist sat remote and enshrined behind it, mirrors on the wall and ceilingbehind him multiplying hisimage. The patrons at the bar were clustered at his feet. They were not there tosee one another, but to seehim. The “Lost Weekend” was well-named; there was no laughter there.28 Schreck, Zeena, “Anton LaVey: Legend & Reality”, 1998.29 Wright, op.cit. , page #68: “The first time the name ‘LaVey’ - or actually‘La Vey’ - makes an appearance in official records is in the wedding applicationfiled in Reno on 9/4/51 between Carole Lansing and Howard Anton La Vey. Theywere divorced in 1962. Karla LaVeysays her mother died in 1975.”30 Wright, op.cit. , page #68: “According to the San Francisco PoliceDepartment, no one named Howard or Anton LaVey or Levey everworked for the force, nor does City College have a record of his enrollment.Frank Moser, a retired police officer who worked in the photodepartment during that time, says that LaVey was never in that department underany name.”31 Wright, op.cit. , page #68: “There actually was no position as city organistin San Francisco, according to Julie Burford at the Civic Auditorium. CaroleLaVey’s divorce pleadings state that her husband’s sole income was $29.91/week,derived from playing the Wurlitzerorgan at the ‘Lost Weekend’ nightclub and ‘various infrequent affairs at theCivic Auditorium’.”- 26 -When faced with situations in which he was vulnerable - such as when heconfronted the draft - Antonwas quick to rationalize his retreat into a type of virtue. Certainly thistendency is not unique to him; allpersons indulge in it. But it is probably fair to say that in his case it wasexcessive. Nowhere is this moreevident than in The Devils Avenger and Secret Life of a Satanist (“biographies”which I think wereactually ghost-written wholly or in major part by Anton himself32 ), in whichthe flood of praise andrationalization is overwhelming. Such emphatic self-esteem contributed toAnton’s undeniable charisma… but it also set the stage for his eventual downfall by making him susceptibleto flattery and unreceptiveto even the most diplomatic of criticism.We are told by DA/SLOAS that in 1956 Anton discovered, admired, and bought thefamous house at6114 California Street. Supposedly it had been built in 1887 by a Scottish seacaptain who had thendisappeared under mysterious circumstances. The house was next acquired by MaryEllen Pleasant, SanFrancisco’s spectacular madam of the Barbary Coast era, and another madam hadsubsequently modifiedthe building with false walls, secret panels, and concealed trapdoors.In actuality the house’s history was quite different, though no less colorful.It was bought by Anton’sparents when they moved from Chicago to San Francisco following his birth.According to her grandfather Joseph, says Zeena, the back (original) portion ofthe house was built ca.1876, and the front portion added after the 1906 San Francisco Fire. Josephindicated that the fireplace inthe living room (the famous “ritual chamber” fireplace seen in many publicityphotos) had been built fromcobblestones taken from one of the streets broken up during the Fire.In the 1950s the elder Leveys moved to another residence in San Francisco,leaving 6114 to their sonfor his home. In 1971 they decided to deed the building jointly to Anton and hissecond wife Diane. 33After taking possession of the house, Anton began to revise it to his personaltaste. All of the interiorrooms were repainted in dramatic colors such as glossy red (his bedroom), glossyblack (the living roomand kitchen), and flat purple (the sitting room). A swinging bookcase was addedto the Purple Room tocreate a secret passage to the Red Room, and a fake-fireplace trapdoor leadingto a basement ladder wasalso added to the Purple Room.To a post-1966 visitor the house announced its sinister presence withtightly-shuttered bay windows,its coat of black paint, and the inquisitive eye of a closed-circuit televisioncamera peering from the atticwindow. Upon daring to enter the dimly-lit hall, the visitor would be brought upshort by a stuffed leopard,then encounter three or four of Anton’s Charles Addams-esque paintings: apig-faced monstrosity in ayellowed wedding dress, a collection of skulls, perhaps a desolate seashore witha tiny figure hangingfrom a gibbet. At the end of the hall would be found the Purple Room, furnishedwith a tombstone coffee-table, a glass-encased skeleton, a barber chair, an infinity mirror with abeautifully-carved frame ofwrithing dæmons, and two bookcases containing scores of curious books onsubjects ranging from theCalifornia criminal code to ritual magic. Several additional paintings by Antongraced the walls [see Plates#4-8].A sign on the moving bookcase assured visitors that they would have their handsamputated if theydared touch the volumes; near the top of the case a stuffed rat glared as if toemphasize the warning.The Red Room contained a black bed raised almost to the ceiling; underneath itwas a small office areaand hi-fi control center. Swords, “morning-star” maces, and rifles lined thewalls. To the right was thebathroom: The wall behind the bathtub displayed a cheerful painted octopus,while the water closet wasequipped with such atmospheric refinements as a plastic rose, a World War I gasmask, and a “Satan WantsYou!” recruiting poster to captivate a captive audience.To the rear of the Purple Room and the Red Room was the kitchen, one wallcovered with a mural ofthe Devil atop a fire-spewing Bald Mountain, and another containing paintings ofthree dæmons with fishtails and/or impossibly jointed arms and legs. Across from this trio the exhaustpipe from the stove entered32 See my discussion of The Devil’s Avenger in Chapter #34.33 6114 California Street Grant Deed, Michael J. Levey and Gertrude A. Levey,July 9, 1971.- 27 -the mouth of still another painted devil, this one of the ordinary red/hornedvariety. The poster advertisingthe Nightmare Alley film added a final, clandestine touch.But as striking as these rooms were, they paled beside the chambers of the housethat Anton wouldconstruct for actual magical pursuits. The glossy-black living room became themain ritual chamber - siteof the Church of Satan’s flamboyant ceremonies - and received electricwall-candles and a red ceiling.Ultimately it would contain a grand piano, a Yamaha concert organ, a large gong,an ornate wooden sleighchair, an upright coffin topped by a stuffed owl, a sculptured peacock, and aleopardskin rug. There was adoor leading to the hallway, and a second door [leading to the Red Room] wascovered with a beautifully-wrought reproduction of an Egyptian sarcophagus.Immediately behind the mummy-door was a trapdoor leading to the basement. Upondescending it ourvisitor would enter the Den of Iniquity - a room resembling a bar, complete withcounter, stools, and jukebox. Later it too would be equipped with a theater organ (the one replaced bythe more elaborate Yamaha),and still later it would become the setting for one of the most nightmarishfeatures of the house: Antonproceeded to acquire mannequins of men, women, and a child; he remolded thefaces to displayexpressions of lechery, drunkenness, and despair; and behind the bar he placed abartender wearing aHalloween-style Devil’s mask modeled after his own face.This melancholy museum - a drunken child sprawled on the floor, a sailorflaunting an oversizedphallus, a young woman turning away from the counter with an expression of griefon her face - wasperhaps the first sign that something would eventually go wrong at 6114California Street. The rest of thehouse was a monument to power, to art, to the glorification of the magnificenceand arrogance of thePrince of Darkness and his works. Where this impressiveness was tempered, it waswith Anton’s impudentbrand of humor and satire - the rose and the gas mask, stuffed rats andtombstones. But the Den of Iniquityhad nothing positive or prideful about it - it radiated misery, callousness,broken dreams, and above all theNightmare Alley inevitability of human failure. Here were the ghosts of thosewhom Anton LaVey hadseen in poolhalls, in shabby amusement parks, on Hollywood’s “Boulevard ofBroken Dreams”. Here wasindeed a tavern in the City of Dreadful Night.But in those early days of the 1950s, the Den of Iniquity had not yet receivedits hideous, artificialclientele. It was merely a room decked out in the spirit of a Gay 90s’ bar, andit was the site of many ahigh-spirited party. Behind it was a smaller room - about the size of a bedroom- accented in blue, coveredwith mirrors, and containing a single coffin on a center platform. This was theBlue Room - the setting forrituals calling for certain optical effects - and in the 1970s it too wouldundergo a terrible, morbidtransformation.And finally, adjacent to the Den of Iniquity, was the innermost sanctum of thehouse: the CouncilChamber [named after the Council of Nine, the advisory body of the Church ofSatan]. It was paintedblack and was furnished with the simplest and starkest of altars, trapezoidal inconstruction. In the CouncilChamber there was no place for the drama, pyrotechnics, and musical thunder ofthe main ritual chamber.Rather one sensed the silence and serenity befitting a Holy of Holies, for herewould audience be heldwith the Prince of Darkness himself.The Sun was not welcome at 6114 California Street. The windows were all tightlyshuttered orcurtained, and our visitor could lose all sense of time after a few hours withinthe buildings confines. Theeffect was to create at once a release from the mundane and a fortress againstit. And, as are so manyhouses, 6114 proved to be a map of the psyche of its owner/creator.In late 1959 Anton found his Vulnavia - a 17-year-old usherette by the name ofDiane Hegarty. In 1962Anton and Carole were divorced, and shortly thereafter Anton gave his name toDiane. Although theywere not legally married, they lived together as man and wife for many years,and that is how she wasknown in the Church of Satan.Diane LaVey has been described by journalist John Godwin as a “smiling,outgoing, hospitable littleblonde”, and by Manson Family member Susan Atkins as “soft-voiced, impeccablymannered, and- 28 -possessed of the longest hair I’d ever seen”.34 True - but such descriptionsfocus on surface images andsocial behavior; they do not approach the individual behind the impression. Andit was Diane LaVey theindividual who was as remarkable in her way as her husband was in his.The LaVey household was decidedly patriarchal, with priorities and decisionsrevolving around theperson of Anton. Diane could easily appear to be self-effacing, even subservientat times when herhusband was holding forth, but even the briefest acquaintance with her wasenough to reveal her actualintelligence and sophistication. Quick to appreciate the social precariousnessand even physical danger ofbeing High Priestess of Satan, she developed the ability to assess peoplecarefully and precisely.There was also a darker side to Anton’s and Diane’s relationship, neither seennor even suspectedoutside the family. According to Zeena, her father was extremely domineeringtowards her mother, andoften flew into savage rages against her:My father violently beat my mother throughout their marriage. In 1984 a policereport was madedescribing Diane being strangled into unconsciousness by him, who was in such amurderous rage that mysister Karla had to pull him off her and drag her outside the house to save herlife. 35Anton’s attitude, adds Zeena, also extended to the family pets:While my father was always careful to portray himself to the public as an animallover, in private hewas cruel to and neglectful of his pets. When he was given Togare as a cub in1964, he was ill-equipped todeal with such an exotic, wild animal despite his pretensions as a circuslion-tamer. As Togare becamelarger and more unruly, Anton frequently used an electric cattle prod to hurtand frighten him intosubmission. 36Many animal-rights proponents, including Togare’s final owner Tippi Hedren,agree that it isdetrimental to a wild animal’s development to be raised in a domesticenvironment. Anton was arrested dueto Togare’s unruly behavior, and was ordered to donate him to the San FranciscoZoo. After complying,Anton made only two visits to Togare. Due to the trauma of his early life,Togare needed special care at theZoo and at every animal-care facility in which he later lived.In the late 1960s Anton acquired a Doberman Pinscher (Loki) as an accent to his“sinister” image.Anton never took the time to housebreak or train Loki, and relegated him to theovergrown and unkemptbackyard of the house, regardless of weather. If Loki ever tried to slip intothe house for shelter, ASLroutinely used Togare’s cattle-prod on him to terrify him back outside.In his old age Loki developed such severe arthritis that he could not climb thestairs to the back door toeat, and began wasting away from malnutrition. Anton then gave him to one of hisprostitute “students”,who at least saw that Loki had a warm, inside home until he died a few monthslater.During my young childhood, I once awoke late at night to hear slamming soundsand the shrieking ofmy German Shepherd puppy. Running downstairs, I saw Anton savagely beating thecowering, cornereddog with a wooden plank. When I begged him to stop and asked him what the doghad done to deserve suchtreatment, he screamed, “She won’t listen to me! I’m going to force her to obeyme!” He continued beatingthe dog until her face was covered with her blood, then dropped the plank andleft the dog quivering in thehallway, so injured and frightened that she wouldn’t let even me come near her.This incident left the dogtraumatized for a long time afterwards. 3734 Godwin, John, Occult America.

See Chapter #3.37 Schreck, Zeena, op.cit.- 29 -If such vicious and callous actions towards Diane or the family pets had becomeknown to Churchmembers, much less the general public, Anton LaVey’s circle of friends andadmirers would probablyhave instantly evaporated, and the Church of Satan would never have come intobeing at all. But - apartfrom Edward Webber’s witnessing of the maltreatment of Togare, as he related tome in 1991 - this uglierside of Anton’s character was kept absolutely secret within the family.During my occasional visits to the LaVey home 1970-75, Anton was invariablypleasant both to Dianeand to the pets. And when he stayed as a guest in my homes, he was always veryfriendly with my Irishsetter Brandy.Nor did Diane, Karla, or Zeena ever breathe a public word of such behavior byAnton until Diane’s“palimony” lawsuit against him in 1988.In the early 1960s Anton began to hold what he termed “midnight magic seminars”on Fridayevenings, lecturing on a wide variety of traditional occult and supernaturalsubjects with which he hadfamiliarized himself over the years. These seminars eventually expanded intobiweekly lectures by 1968or 1969, and their colorfulness can be glimpsed from the handbill that describedthem:ANTON SZANDOR LA VEYPracticing sorcerer, High Priest of the Church of Satan,and world renowned authority on the Black Arts- PRESENTS -A series of informal lectures held each Wednesday and Thursday night at 9:00P.M. at 6114 CaliforniaStreet, San Francisco, and covering the following subjects:Ghosts and Hauntings: Survival after death, mediums, spiritualism, seances,haunted houses, blightedland areas, murder and suicide spots, psychical research methods, spontaneoushuman combustion, strangedisappearances, suggested field trips, etc.Love Potions and Monkey Glands: Eccentric sexual theories, gland transplants,miraculous beds,recipes for elixirs, sex changes and rejuvenation techniques, etc.ESP and Telepathic Communication: The production, interpretation, andcontinuation of dreams;teleportation, bilocation, sensory deprivation, deja vu, telekinesis, astralprojection, dematerialization, etc.The Triumph of Pain: Torture methods and implements, highly inventivesadomasochistic devices andpractices, chastity belts, religious self-mutilation, beds of nails, human pincushions - everything from ironmaidens to tight corsets!The Magical Powers of Animals: The lore and legend of the cat, dog, horse,snake, spider, scarab,salamander, whale; the role of the familiar in witchcraft, animal ESP, etc.Strange People: Bizarre and outlandish characters, hermits, flagpole sitters,misers and string savers,crackpots, creeps, and screwballs.The Kingdom of Death: Strange and unusual funeral practices, theories ofheavens, hells, limbos, etc.;the shrines of death - cemeteries, crypts, and tombs - ornate and otherwise;lovers of the dead - necrophilia,etc.The Vampire: The realm of the undead, Dracula and his modern counterparts,bloodsuckers andghouls, some never-before-documented evidence.Music and Magic: Strange and little-known lore on certain musical compositions,musical pitch andcorresponding colors, the use of music in the manipulation of human and animalbehavior, etc.Color and Its Magical Implications: Influences on the emotions, analysis ofcolor preferences, colororgans, healing and therapy use, how to bewitch through the proper use of color,etc.A Cup of Grue: Man’s fascination for the gory and horrible, examples of grislymurders, humansacrifice, cannibalism [with recipes], the Grand Guignol, etc. - Stay home ifyou have a weak stomach!Fortune Telling and Character Analysis: Crystal gazing, card reading, palmistry,phrenology, tea-leafreading, handwriting analysis, facial expression, physical types, glandulartypes, means of divination,dowsing, the Ouija board, psychometry, etc.Primitive Magic: Voodoo, macumba, hexes, jungle sorcery, Jivaro head-shrinking[with instructions],zombies, etc.- 30 -Monuments to Madness: Architectural follies, outrageous inventions, strangeamusement devices,castles, labyrinths, mazes, grotesque gardens, buildings, and dwellings of abizarre nature, etc.The Werewolf: From human into animal, changelings, leopard men, swan maidens,serpent people,man and his choice of pets, women and their choice of furs, etc.Semi-Authenticated Creatures: such as the abominable snowmen, bigfoot,sasquatch, wendigo, etc.;sea serpents, missing links, man-eating plants, unicorn, gryphon, dragon,basilisk, roc, etc.Freaks: The passing of the side show, anomalies and curiosities, the strangeworld of swordswallowers, fire eaters, cyclops, geeks, pinheads, Siamese twins, alligator men,midgets, giants, fat ladies(over 400 lbs.), etc.The Black Mass: Detailed description, the secret rites of the Templars, HellfireClub, Order of theGolden Dawn, Black Order, etc.; famous practitioners - from Simon Magus toAleister Crowley;contemporary versions of the Black Mass.[Note: Most lectures will be accompanied by slides and/or demonstrations.]The demonstrations were often the best part of the lectures. Anton was notbeyond calling somenervous young man forward, making a careful examination of the phrenologicalcharacteristics of hisskull, and solemnly pronouncing him a champion in the arts of the bedroom. Butthe most notorious of thedemonstrations took place shortly after the beginning of the seminars, duringthe lecture on cannibalism.A dish was duly prepared by Diane and served to the invited guests as “leg ofhuman being” [supposedlyacquired for the occasion by a Berkeley physician attending the seminars].Genuine “long pig”? It isdoubtful, if only because the legal risks to both the physician and the would-becannibals seem moreexcessive than the culinary delights of the experience. One may hypothesize legof mutton, exoticgarnishments courtesy of Diane, and the mischievous Anton Szandor LaVey sense ofhumor!The seminars attracted a loyal following, and by the mid-sixties the core hadgradually stabilized intowhat Anton called his Magic Circle. It would attract such notables as novelistStephen Schneck andunderground filmmaker Kenneth Anger, and it was the nucleus of what wouldshortly become the Churchof Satan. During this same period Anton acquired his famous African lion Togare,who quickly became aminor sensation throughout both the immediate neighborhood and the city as awhole.And so, by a unique combination of disposition, education, and experience, AntonLaVey had becomea practicing Master of the Black Arts, grasping ever more boldly after knowledgethat was shunned andeven feared by conventional schools of research and philosophy. Now the year was1966, and his life wasabout to be crystallized by a most unprecedented event - the founding of theChurch of Satan.[index-31_1.jpg]- 31 -“To 1966 - The Year One!”- Roman Castevet in Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s BabyOn the night of April 30, 1966, so the legend goes, Anton LaVey shaved hishead38, donned a blackclerical collar39, and proclaimed the beginning of the Age of Satan and thefounding of the Church ofSatan. The date had been chosen because it was Walpurgisnacht, even more thanHalloween a traditionaloccasion for the ascendancy of the Powers of Darkness over those of light andheavenly harmony. Thedate also coincides roughly with the Vernal Equinox, again a traditionalfestival for the pagan religions ofantiquity.How the Church of Satan actually came into being was somewhat less cataclysmic,if no lessinteresting:By early 1966 Anton LaVey had become well-known as San Francisco’s resident“sorcerer”, teacher ofclasses on various forms of occultism, lion-trainer [he occasionally took Togareon visits to local schoolsand children’s television shows, such as Brother Buzz], and owner of the bestFun House this side ofPlayland-at-the-Beach. But an ingredient to coalesce all of this into somethingseriously significant wasstill lacking. Until it was found, Anton LaVey was too easy to lump togetherwith all of the other odditiesof San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury-era eccentri-city.The missing ingredient, of course, turned out to be Satan.Remarked one lady who lived next door to Anton:He’s been a neighbor about 14 years, and I always knew him as Tony. A littlemore dramatic than mostmen in the neighborhood, perhaps … and I think it was rather original of him tohave conceived this idea.According to Mr. Webber, a publicity man whom I met, he and Mr. LaVey came uponthe idea that, withLaVey owning a lion, a Satanist church would be a wonderful offshoot since hedid evidently believe in theDevil.I heard that at one time he was planning on setting up a sort of house of whipssimilar to one run backeast [by Monique von Cleef]. This did disturb me, but I understand that itdidn’t pan out.The only discord came when he had the lion. Initially everyone thought “gee, howcute”, because hewas only the size of a large cat. But then he got to be 3 years old and 500pounds of lion, and that’s quite38 “Concerning my father’s shaving his head during the Walpurgisnacht ritual,”says Zeena Schreck, “I heard the true story many timesthroughout my childhood. Some time after Walpurgisnacht he accidentally trimmeda bit too much of his hair in the bathroom. My motherDiane was quite fond of his thick, black, wavy hair and implored him to quitwhile he was ahead - but he continued chopping, finding herreaction amusing. She threatened to cut off all of her hair if he continued.Knowing that she wasn’t about to butcher 3-1/2’ of her own mane -which fell 4” past her rear! - he simply continued until his own pate was quitebald. So much for the ‘Yezidi priest shaving in the Zam ZamRiver’ symbolism!”39 Anton used a black clerical collar with white insert: identical to that of aCatholic priest. In 1970 I chose a black insert, which thereafterbecame the standard throughout the Priesthood.- 32 -different than having a little kitty-cat for a neighbor. At night he would roar,and you’d get up and think youwere near Mount Kilimanjaro or something!Once Mr. LaVey was baby-sitting a jaguar for a friend. The lion became jealousand started tearing upall the pipes on the porch. They couldn’t very well call a plumber, becausethere aren’t very many plumberswho’d go out there …40The “Mr. Webber” referred to by this neighbor is Edward M. Webber, aprofessional publicity agent. In1991 I interviewed him concerning the origins of the Church of Satan, andextracts from that interviewfollow as appropriate in this chapter.MA: What was your first meeting with Anton LaVey?EW: In early 1966 my wife Barbara had a hair stylist in the West Portal area ofSan Francisco. He hadbeen attending lectures by Anton, who at the time was also playing the organ atthe “Lost Weekend” baron Taraval Street.On Friday nights he would lecture on various subjects - lycanthropy, voyeurism,and so forth.Barbara’s hairdresser suggested that we attend a lecture, and so a couple ofweeks later Barbara and I wentto 6114 California Street.About 20 people were present, and it was very interesting. After the talk we allwent out on the backporch to play with Togare the lion and have coffee.Barbara and I returned for subsequent lectures. One weekend I said to Anton thathe would never makeany money by lecturing on Friday nights charging donations - that since at thetime he was starting to talkmore about Satanism and the Devil than other subjects, it would be better toform some sort of a churchand get a charter from the State of California. This would make it possible toincrease the attendance at hislectures and also secure tax benefits.MA: In the original edition of Arthur Lyons’ book Satanism in America , Anton isquoted as “referringmysteriously to the ‘blinding flash’ of his own Satanic dawning” where thefounding of the Church ofSatan is concerned.EW: Well, it might have been a blinding flash called Ed Webber and Tony Kent!I know for a fact that the idea of a church had never even entered Anton’s mind.At the time he wasvery comfortable with 20 people and $5-10 worth of donations on Friday night anddoing his little socialsort of thing. I had some background in churches and charters and taxconsiderations, and I felt that thiswas the way to create a vehicle for people to learn about Satanism. I knew thatnothing like a Satanicchurch existed at the time, because we researched that pretty thoroughly too.During the next few weeks I invited a number of people here in San Francisco -real estate people suchas Don and Willy Werby, nightclub people such as Al Williams, a couple of publicrelations people such asAnthony Kent - agent for Leslie Caron - and a columnist to come and hear Anton.I started bringing a lotof media contacts, and then some celebrities I knew who’d be in town.Everyone agreed that it’d be a lot more interesting if he’d form a Church ofSatan.So we started working out the details. Tony Kent introduced us to an attorneywho specialized incharters, and we sat down and talked with the attorney about getting a charterfor the First Church of Satanthrough the California Secretary of State in Sacramento.While the papers were being filed, we began looking into possible meeting-placesthat could hold2-400 people for lectures and rituals. We approached the Masonic Temple on NobHill and the Fugazi Hall- where “Beach Blanket Babylon” is now - in North Beach. I knew the Italianfamily who was runningthat building, and it certainly would have seated more people than Anton’sliving room.40 First lady neighbor of Anton LaVey’s in Satanis: The Devil’s Mass(documentary film by Pierre Laurent, 1970).- 33 -We also checked out the Unitarian Church on Franklin Street and spoke with CecilWilliams aboutpossibly using his Glide Memorial Methodist Church. When Williams learned thatit was the First Churchof Satan we were talking about, he just laughed and said, “Well, you know, Idon’t know how we couldwork that out.”MA: On Walpurgisnacht 1966, when the Church was officially founded, was thereany specialceremony and if so what?EW: We did celebrate on Walpurgisnacht when the Church became official. I don’trecall the details. Ithink Kenneth Anger, Tony Kent, Barbara, and I were there.MA: At the time did Anton assume any titles or offices?EW: High Priest of the First Church of Satan. Barbara became a Priestess, and Ibecame a Priest. I toldAnton at the time that the press was going to flip out over all this and that wewould get a lot of notoriety,and that it was best that I became his press representative to deal with themedia.MA: Did he refer to himself by the term “Magus”?EW: No, he never used the word.MA: Was there any sort of initiatory degree system?EW: No, there wasn’t. I believe Anton gave titles of some sort to Diane and thekids, but that was it.There was no Magus, no hierarchy at that point in time.Just what were those “Powers of Darkness” which Anton felt compelled toformalize into a church?Per Wolfe’s account in The Devil’s Avenger, Anton sensed them only vaguely as a“dark force in nature”which could be activated through ceremonial/ritual (“greater”) andpersonal/manipulative (“lesser”) magicto fulfill individuals’ needs and desires. He identified this “dark force” asSatan; hence the name he chosefor the church.Did Anton LaVey sense Satan as an independent, intellectual entity [as opposedto the “dark force”being a collection of non-conscious, mechanical/physical principles]? Theevidence from his closestassociates at the time is that he did.MA: Since 1975 Anton LaVey has insisted that he never believed in the existenceof an actual Devil orSatan - that “Satan” was only a symbol or metaphor. Was this true when you knewhim?EW: Not at all. He was quite definite that he did believe in the existence ofSatan. This was exactlywhat made the concept of a Church of Satan so fascinating.Anton affirmed his belief in the 1970 documentary film Satanis41, in his writingof a personal Pactwith Satan, and of course with ritual incantations and invocations he ferventlyuttered while presiding atChurch rituals. While after the crisis of 1975 - and Anton’s disavowal of Satanat that moment - he wouldinsist that the name was a mere metaphor, such a turnabout was obviously mererationalization for hisactions at that time.Less clear throughout the Church of Satan’s 1966-75 existence was just who orwhat Satan as an entityactually was. Certainly Satanists didn’t believe in Jewish, Christian, orIslamic mythology, which theyrejected with the same disgust and disdain they held for those religionsgenerally. Rather the Church ofSatan saw its namesake as someone or something truly noble, powerful, andmetaphysically authentic,whose image had been distorted and perverted by the vulgar religions into asymbol of everything they41 “I’m in league with the Devil as much as any mortal can possibly be.”- 34 -feared and hated. And what it was that they feared and hated was not “evil”, butrather the creative geniusof mankind that lifts it above and beyond mere animal existence.This was not something that the Church of Satan collectively or Anton LaVeypersonally discovered ina flash of light on or about Walpurgisnacht 1966. At that time “Satan” waslargely a symbolic standard-bearer of social criticism and affirmation of individual license (“IndulgenceInstead of Abstinence”). Yeteven then he was sensed to be the “old Devil”, and as such a very real god tohis new disciples.What I did not know for many years was that coincidental with the forming of theChurch in 1966,Anton LaVey had privately handwritten and signed a personal Pact with Satan(titled simply “My Pact”).He never mentioned nor displayed it to others, but on one evening in 1974,during a visit of mine to 6114,we happened to be discussing Robert W. Chambers’ The King in Yellow. He left thePurple Room, thenreturned with a locked metal strongbox, which he opened, revealing his personalcopy of the then-quite-rare book. The only other item in the strongbox was his Pact - which I wasunable to read beyond seeingits title and noting that it was completely handwritten on a single sheet ofpaper. I have often wonderedwhat mirrors of his innermost self it contained.The Magic Circle, as forerunner to the formal Church of Satan, had taken variousactivities andoperations of formal Black Magic out of the theoretical and into the practical.It can be presumed that suchritual work, as it became increasingly explicit and sincere, exerted its ownpressure for fullacknowledgment, full formalization of what it was that was being undertaken -and in whose name. Oncethe door was wedged open, the eventual creation and affirmation of the Church ofSatan was but aquestion of time.But beyond the internal excitement and pleasure of bringing an authentic Satanicreligion and Churchinto existence, there was also a very real external danger. In 1966, as far asthe general public wasconcerned, “Satanism” was a term virtually synonymous with vague but mostheinous excesses ofcriminal behavior. Even a city as counterculturally tolerant as San Franciscowould not hesitate topersecute and destroy a Church of Satan if it believed it anything more than aglorified Halloween party.And so Anton LaVey found it necessary not only to be the High Priest of Satan,but to play at beingthe High Priest - both for the general public and for the first members of theChurch itself. He was the“Devil”, yes - but a devil in the best Mardi Gras tradition, complete with cape,cowl, and even artificialhorns. He made dramatic appearances at public events (such as the premiere ofRosemary’s Baby), and hecourted media exposure. He was something new for even so jaded a Babylon as SanFrancisco, andunsurprisingly it took him under its wing. Anton Szandor LaVey was “safe”; hewas not a fiend from Hellbut rather Emperor Norton with a pitchfork. Association with the Church or atleast a visit to one of itspublic functions became a requirement for the avant-garde. They laughed atAnton, and he laughed withthem, and it was all great fun.Coincidental with the formation of the Church of Satan as such was the Order ofthe Trapezoid,apparently an early formalization of some of the Magic Circle regulars. Once theChurch was organized,the name was appropriated for the local council which met at the LaVey home toplan weekly Churchevents. The first official mention of the term came in the December V/1970Cloven Hoof, wherein Antonstated:The Order of the Trapezoid is the “board of directors” and security staff of theChurch. Its functions aremany, and its members are chosen by appointment, according to the specialabilities and attributes of each.All Priests and Priestesses are automatically admitted into the Order, althoughthe identities of mostmembers of the Order are unknown even to each other. Members of the Governing orGrand Council of theTrapezoid are known only to the High Priest, who solicits their aid whenrequired.In 1985, ten years after the demise of the Church of Satan and following theXXVII/1982reconstitution of the Order of the Trapezoid by the Temple of Set, Antonattempted to claim greatersubstance and antiquity for it:- 35 -The Order of the Trapezoid was the name of the founding body - the originalMagic Circle - of theChurch of Satan. Loosely formed in 1957 as an eclectic group of savants who metin a strange black house,it soon gained cohesion and by the mid-1960s achieved a reputation as the onlything of its kind extant. Itsname was taken from the geometric configuration of the most formidable shape innature, the epitome ofMortensen’s “dominant mass”.Its insignia consisted of a perfect trapezoid enclosing the inverted pentagramof the Costa Ricandiabolist sect Los Hermanos Diablo: two points thrust upwards in defiance ofHeaven, with the lower pointbroken open and split outwards, allowing the “evil” to enter freely. The Orderof the Trapezoid augmentedthis opening by placing an upwards-thrust trident inside, its linescorresponding to the configuration of thepentagon formed inside the entire symbol. The “666” occupied the spaces betweenthe upper points of thepentagram. The whole symbol, when displayed for any other than secret ritualpurposes, was covered by anidentically-sized trapezoid bearing the likeness of a bat-winged dæmon. Theseare the amulets worn inphotographs prior to the formal inauguration of the Church of Satan. When theChurch was declared onApril 30, I/1966, it was only natural that those already-established memberswould constitute its governingbody. Hence the Order of the Trapezoid became the official guiding force behindthe organization. 42As intriguing as this account is, what actually seems to have happened is thatthere was no “Order ofthe Trapezoid” beyond Anton’s use of the term for his local meeting planninggroup until about 1969-70.Before then Anton had indeed had a personal magical interest in the trapezoid(what mathematiciansprefer more precisely to call the “trapezium”) per Mortensen’s book, LouisMcCarty’s The Great PyramidJeezeh, Sheila Ostrander & Lynn Schroeder’s Psychic Discoveries Behind the IronCurtain, FrankBelknap Long’s The Hounds of Tindalos, and H.P. Lovecraft’s The Haunter of theDark. [All of these werecited as references in Anton’s December V/1970 Cloven Hoof article.]MA: Was there anything called the Order of the Trapezoid?EW: Anton was talking about the significance of the trapezoid at the time whenBarbara and I attendedour first lecture. Later we introduced a couple, Lorelei and Dion Vigne, wholived on upper Grant Avenueand made enameled jewelry. They became quite interested. When the Church wasorganized, theydesigned a leather neck pendant for all of us containing a trapezoid and theBaphomet. That was the onlyreference to the trapezoid at the time, except that we would use it in rituals.MA: Was there a Council of Nine or Council of the Trapezoid?EW: Not while I was there. That all came after my departure.The “PR posture” of the Church of Satan was a strain on Anton, but his innerconviction drove him on.As good as his Mardi Gras mask was, however, it was not quite good enough,because some people -particularly his closest associates in the fledgling Church - began to sensesomething in him that wasn’t atall “carny”. When he would preside over a ritual, standing before the altar andthundering forth aproclamation in the name of Satan, chills would go down the backs of thosepresent, and they wouldsuddenly feel very much out of their depth. Later they might laugh it off,reassuring themselves that “hereally is quite a showman”. But the laughter would be hesitant. Commentedanother lady neighbor:Actually I don’t know what kind of man he is. His appearance is very nice. Hemakes a very goodimpression. He has a very soft voice, and he talks so smooth, so pleasant. Assoon as you meet him, youthink he is a very, very nice man. But there is definitely something going wrongover there. I just have afeeling I can’t trust him. There are women there who are without clothes -naked. And the men wear a - a42 LaVey, Anton, “The Order of the Trapezoid”, Cloven Hoof #XVII-1, SpringXX/1985.- 36 -kind of black hooded robe. And sometimes from my window I can see a kind of redlight and silhouetteslike devils. And one silhouette, a big one - maybe it’s him, standing over thewhole crowd and preaching. 43In October actress Jayne Mansfield came north from Hollywood for an appearanceat the SanFrancisco Film Festival. Edward Webber recounts what happened next:MA: SLOAS says that Jayne Mansfield asked to meet Anton.EW: Jayne Mansfield never asked to meet Anton. Jayne was in San Francisco for afilm festival. Shewas a close friend of a socialite named Lucia Anderson Halsey - no connection toAdmiral Bull Halsey -who lived in the Royal Towers. Lucia knew Barbara Hutton, as they had homes nextto each other inHawaii. She also knew a local astrologer by the name of Gavin Arthur,great-grandson of PresidentChester A. Arthur.Arthur, Tony Kent, Ron Bigham, Sam Brody, and Jayne were spending an evening atLucia’sapartment. Arthur or Kent told Lucia about Anton LaVey and the First Church ofSatan he and Ed Webberwere organizing, and suggested a visit. They all said fine and jumped intoRolls-Royces and limos anddrove out to California Street.At 1:30 AM the phone rang in my home in Forest Knolls. Tony Kent said, “I’msorry to wake you andBarbara up, but Jayne Mansfield is over at Anton’s and she’d like to meet you.Lucia and I told her allabout you.” So we went over to meet her.Mansfield took the evening in good humor and with more than a touch of awe.Brody, who sensed herevident attraction to this Satanic Svengali, announced his scorn for the wholebusiness. What took placenext was later recounted by Jayne:Mr. LaVey took me into another room to show me the black magic charms from theDevil, and hepresented me with one. He said I was now the High Priestess of his church.Someone is always giving mesome honor or title. I didn’t want to insult him, so I accepted the emblem on aleather string which heplaced around my neck. He said some witchcraft words which I didn’t understand.When we returned to the altar room, Sam was angry and more jealous. To spite Mr.LaVey, Sam hadlighted the forbidden candles on the altar which only the Devil himself has theauthority to light. Mr. LaVeywas furious with Sam. He proclaimed, “You are cursed by the Devil. You will bekilled within a year!” Hewas very serious. Sam laughed, believing it all amusing.Mr. LaVey called me into a back room. There he told me, “The Devil has placed acurse on Sam Brody."},{"pageContent":"There is a heavy black cloud over him. Get rid of him at once, or you will sharethis curse from the Devil.No one laughs at the Devil! He’ll be killed in a car crash - not one but asuccession of them. Anyone withhim will be killed. Get rid of him at once!” 44 [index_split_002.html#p36]The newspapers quoted Anton as proclaiming Jayne Mansfield his new HighPriestess. “Oh, that’s sosilly,” observed the actress:Anton LaVey is a very handsome and interesting man. He has this big black houseon a hill with a 500-pound lion. He drives a black hearse. He is highly intelligent. He told me hehad fallen in love with me andwanted to join my life with his. It was a laugh. I did not wear the Devil’ssymbols and the charms he gaveme. I was too polite to refuse, however. 45 [index_split_002.html#p36]43 Second lady neighbor of Anton LaVey’s in Satanis: The Devil’s Mass.44 Mann, May, Jayne Mansfield. New York: Pocket Books #78704, 1974, page #197.45 Ibid., page #230.- 37 -JAYNE WAS A SATANIST! gasped the National Insider, headlining a 1968 interviewwith the BlackPope. Anton confirmed that the actress had participated in private Satanicceremonies - including loverituals. “But doesn’t that mean that you and she …?” inquired the reporter.“Precisely,” he responded. 46MA: “From the moment they met,” says SLOAS , “Jayne was intensely attracted toAnton - anattraction that would quickly grow into an obsession … Anton described her as ‘alewd, lascivious viragowho was happiest when rolling on the floor with masochistic, orgiastic energy.’”EW: That’s totally untrue. She was very intrigued by the lectures on Fridaynights and the rest of it,but I don’t think it was love at first bite. Jayne was scared to death, she toldme privately, about themeeting. She was a PR lady and knew how to manipulate the media. That kind ofpress in those yearscould have absolutely destroyed Jayne’s career.If Jayne were alive, she would probably have sued Anton if she saw this kind ofgarbage in print. It’sabsolutely untrue. Sam Brody would probably have got into his Bentley, driven toSan Francisco, pickedup Anton, and thrown him across the room. Sam was known for that.Diane LaVey later denied to me that Anton had ever telephoned Jayne after herinitial visit; rather itwas the actress who had swamped him with calls. “Jayne may have told May Mann afew ‘white lies’ tosalve her own ego over Anton’s aloofness towards her,” Diane continued,“especially since she - literallyand figuratively - threw herself at him. And she just about busted (!) trying toget a rise out of me!” VictorHuston had become a friend of the LaVeys, dropping in at 6114 to play the drumsat a party some timeafter Mansfield’s death. And Sam Brody, she said, was not cursed for “touchingthe sacred objects” butrather for his rudeness over a period of time. 47MA: What sort of person was Sam Brody? Anton has always painted the worstpossible picture of him.EW: Sam Brody was a brilliant, very successful, and very rich attorney - herepresented Melvin Belli’sfirm in Los Angeles. He was a tough little man and knew a lot of interesting andunusual people, havingbeen a legal counsel for gangsters. He knew Jack Ruby before Ruby shot Oswald,for example, and wasthe first attorney to see Jack Ruby after the Oswald assassination.Sam and Jayne were very deeply entrenched as lovers; he never had any fear aboutJayne havinganything to do with Anton. That’s a made-up story. It is true that Sam detestedAnton from the moment hemet him. Sam Brody and I did become good friends, however.I got to know Jayne very well from that meeting at Anton’s. She was anincredibly bright woman whowas interested in her career. As far as her sex life was concerned, I doubt thatAnton ever saw her anydifferently than the public saw her. I don’t think she ever allowed him to seeher in the mode of the writingof this book [ SLOAS].I don’t think he knew anything, ever, about her personal life. I know for a factthat she used to call himfrom her home in Los Angeles. There were 6-8 phones in that house, and she usedto let people come over,and that was what they’d do at night as a joke to have fun when they were bored.They’d pick up theextensions, she’d call up Anton and do her act on the phone, lower her voice andsay, “Anton, this isJayney.” And she’d turn him on, and while he was talking everybody’d belistening, and they’d all laughand hang up. And I know that for a fact because she told me so herself.MA: Diane LaVey is quoted in SLOAS as saying that Jayne would have moved rightinto 6114California Street if she had half the chance … that she had her makeup all overthe bathroom, her clothesstrewn all over the place.46 National Insider, December 1, 1968, page #11.47 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 18, VIII/1973.- 38 -EW: No, Jayne never stayed there. When in San Francisco, she and Sam stayed inthe PresidentialSuite at the Fairmont Hotel. Why would she stay out at California Street? As formakeup: Jayne rarelywore makeup at night when she was out with her friends. And as far as herclothes being thrown all overthe house, that’s absolutely untrue.Early in the year 1967 San Francisco was treated to the first Satanic wedding atthe black house onCalifornia Street. John Raymond, a journalist, married New York socialite JudithCase on February 1under the benevolent ægis of the Black Pope [as the media had begun to styleAnton]. Joe Rosenthal, thephotographer who gained fame in World War II for his shot of the Iwo Jima flagraising, took the officialpicture.The general commotion apparently told on the neighbors, and a complaint wasfiled - not againstAnton or the Church, but against the presence of Togare the lion. The petitionto District Attorney JohnFerdon complained that Togare “… roars vociferously at all hours of the day andnight, thereby disturbingthe peace. It is also felt that the beast is a potential danger to ourselves andour children”. 48Anton was accordingly charged with violating Section 415 of the Penal Code [fordisturbing thepeace]. He agreed to give Togare to the San Francisco Zoo - but the case was notdropped, and he wasfined fifty dollars and given a ninety-day suspended sentence.Edward Webber’s account of the departure of Togare is a bit different:MA: How did you and the LaVeys come to part ways?EW: It had to do with Togare the lion. I used to go play with him all the time.Anton and Togareusually got along well, but sometimes he acted up to Anton. Then Anton wouldsmack him, and he alsohad an electric cattle prod he would use on him.Anton owed me money as the result of our agreement for my publicity work. Herefused to pay it. Iwent to small claims court. The judge awarded me a judgment for whatever theamount was at the time.Even after being served, Anton still refused to pay. So I asked the judge toattach Togare. He did so andasked me what I wanted to do with this attachment. I said I’d like the lion putinto the San Francisco Zoo,where it would get better treatment than it was getting by Mr. LaVey.Togare went to the zoo and lived there happily for a number of years. LaterTippi Hedren took Togareto her wildlife preserve, Shamballa, near Los Angeles. Tippi just recently gaveme a book on her life andShamballa, and sure enough there was a picture of Togare. I called Tippi andtalked to her about it. Togarehas since died but has lots of offspring running around Shamballa - lots of bigpussycats. 49Jayne Mansfield went off to Vietnam to visit the troops, startling her militaryhosts by requestingSatanic religious services. 50 After she returned to the United States, sheinvited Anton to visit her “PinkPalace” in Beverly Hills. Accounts of that visit differ. The Devil’s Avengerdescribes it as a pleasantoccasion, but May Mann recounts that Jayne was secretly terrified of LaVey andhoped to convince him tolift the curse he had pronounced on Sam Brody. According to Mann, he refused. 5148 Wolfe, op.cit. , page #164.49 Cf. Hedren, Tippi, The Cats of Shamballa.New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985. Pages#72-73: “Togare arrived from the San Francisco Zoo, ayoung adult in his prime. Big Togare, with a dark mane, was an outcast, toobelligerent for the Bay City zookeepers to handle, though theydidn’t tell us that; they just wanted to get rid of him. He had originally beenowned by someone involved in Black Magic, but for whateverreason he arrived rough, tough, and defiant. His low, guttural rumble had enoughpower to quiver the cottonwood leaves and us. I was afraidof Togare the moment I saw him, yet he turned out to be one of the best fathersin the compounds, gentle and playful with the 30-odd cubs hesired.”50 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 17, IV/1969.51 Wolfe, op.cit. , pages #180-181. Mann, op.cit. , pages #247-249.- 39 -MA: Like The Devil’s Avenger , SLOAS contains photographs of Anton, Jayne, andJayne’s family ather home.EW: She allowed those photos to be taken only with the absolute guarantee fromAnton that theywould not be published.On June 29 Jayne Mansfield and Sam Brody were killed in an automobile crash. Tothe moresensationalist media that accident - and Anton LaVey’s curse thereto pertaining- subsequently became oneof the most interesting things that could be said about the Church of Satan. Inthe 1968 interview with theNational Insider that focused on Jayne’s interest in Satanism, Anton saidnothing about the curse, andwithin the Church of Satan it was simply considered as a convenient coincidence.52 The 1973 publicationof the Mann biography apparently revived Anton’s interest in the matter, and ininterviews given after1975 his accounts grew more provocative, culminating in a 1979 Hustler versionthat had Mansfieldasking Anton to pronounce “the ultimate curse - the death rune”:After much deliberation and considerable provocation from Brody, LaVey says heagreed to conduct aprivate but formal destruction ritual. According to his story, he placed theattorney’s name on a piece ofparchment and burned it, invoking the power of the infernal names and callingfor Brody’s annihilationwithin a year. 53There was no “death rune curse” in the ceremonial inventory of the Church ofSatan. According torune-lore the Eoh-rune is associated with death, but in reverence, not as acurse. The Church of Satan’sfamiliarity with rune-lore, in any case, was not extensive. Hence use of therunes in this instance does notcommend itself to credibility.Anton LaVey explored other avenues besides Hollywood for the publicizing of theChurch. Intriguedby the “topless” phenomenon then pervading the Broadway Strip in San Francisco,he came up with thenotion of a “Topless Witches Sabbath” act.MA: What is the story of the Topless Witches Review?EW: A good friend of mine named Gino del Prete owned the Condor Club, madefamous by CarolDoda. The owner of a club two doors down Broadway wanted Anton to go there witha topless witchesshow. I told Anton emphatically he shouldn’t do anything like that. “We’re inthe process of getting thestate charter, and if they find women running around with their breasts bared,they’re just never going todo it.” But he went ahead and did it anyway. I was really mad at Anton for doingthat.Arrangements were made with one of the nightclubs on the strip, and Antonselected a young dancerwith the stage name of “Sharon King” to play the central role of a vampire. Herreal name was SusanAtkins.MA: Susan Atkins of the Manson Family was one of the topless witches.EW: I think she had been working at that club in North Beach. I went to see theshow and met her atthat time. Years later, when Barbara and I were living in Mendocino, she andCharles Manson and PatriciaKrenwinkel showed up at our home as uninvited guests for a party we gave for afamous musician and hisband.Two days after accepting the part, Susan joined her employer and otherprospective topless witches ina visit to 6114. Later she recounted her impressions:52 Mann, op.cit. , page #197.53 Harden, Fred, “Anton LaVey, Disciple of the Devil” in Hustler, December 1979,page #102.- 40 -Garnet reached for the doorbell. I expected a gong or a howl or something. Itwas an ordinary “dingdong”. The door opened, and there stood LaVey, all in black, his powdery whiteskin glowing. I felt sick atmy stomach as I walked past him. His smile was sickly, I thought. Then I frozein my steps. Straight aheadat the far end of the entrance hall was a human skeleton in a glass case. Itseemed to have the same sicklysmile as LaVey. “This is all the horror movies rolled into one,” I thought.“What am I doing here? I wonderif I’ll get out of here in one piece.” 54Upon being invited to stay for the evening’s ceremony, Susan lost what was leftof her nerve, informedAnton that she had been raised to worship God and not the Devil, and left. Shewas not deterred fromstarring in the “Topless Witches Sabbath”, however. High on LSD for courage, shereadied herself for theopening performance:I looked at my two-inch-long, false fingernails, painted brilliant red. And myface was somethingspecial, as I looked up into the mirror. It was eerie - milky, white, broken bybright red lips that matched thecolor of the fingernails and by seemingly sunken blue-black eyes expertlytwisted upward at the outsidecorners - grotesquely exaggerated cat eyes. Jet black hair framed it all. I wasthe perfect, sexy vampire,ready for my casket lying at the center of the stage.As the end of the production neared, I lay inside the casket. I remembered verylittle of the show. I hadshaken several people with the reality of my performance when I had risen fromthe casket and pointed along, blood-red fingernail at the audience and marked them as my next victims.Gasps from both males andfemales had sounded all around the club. But as I lay there, I fancied the ideaof being dead and still hearingall the sounds around me. I heard everything - the footsteps, the breathing, thesighs in the audience. “ButI’m dead,” I thought. “It’s so pleasant … I’m outside my dead body … I’m aspirit … I can see and heareverything … I’m dead … but I’m really alive.” I lay in the casket so long thatI missed the curtain call byfive minutes. I just didn’t want to get out of it. 55“Subsequently,” said psychiatrist Dr. Joel Hochman in a report prepared at thetime of the Sharon Tatemurder trials, “she stayed on her ‘Satanic trip’ [for] approximately eightmonths.” 56 During this time sheattended “witches’ workshops” at 6114 and was photographed with other girlstogether with Anton in themain ritual chamber. 57In The World of the Twilight Believers Richard Garvin and Robert Burger gave theTopless WitchesReview a somewhat uncomplimentary assessment:LaVey made an ill-fated attempt to publicize his new church by concocting arather seedy show in SanFrancisco’s North Beach, during which three topless witches symbolically seducedthe “Grand Inquisitor”,a former divinity counselor for Billy Graham, who was dressed that evening inthe bottom half of a light-blue bikini. This, he explained, was to “express the transvestite image. We’reall possessed of that animus;the duality of man and woman is in all of us. The Devil himself is ahermaphroditic deity.” 58The Church of Satan again made headlines in May, this time for Anton’s baptismof Zeena Galatea, hissecond daughter, by Diane. Zeena recalls the event vividly:54 Atkins, op.cit. , pages #68-69.55 Ibid. , pages #71-72.56 Bugliosi, Vincent with Gentry, Curt, Helter Skelter. New York: W.W. Norton,Inc., 1974, page #473.57 Wolfe, op.cit. , photo facing page #113.

Los Angeles: Sherbourne Press, Inc., 1970, pages#257-258.- 41 -Originally a couple who had just joined the Church that year asked if my fatherwould perform abaptism for their newborn baby. He promptly set out to develop an appropriateritual - and tipped the pressto the historic event. The first Satanic baptism! The word spread like wildfire.Overwhelmed by attention and fearful of wrath from their relatives, the proudparents got cold feet andbacked out. But “the show must go on”, and with the requisite stroke of geniusmy parents elected me to fillthe role. What better choice for the Church of Satan’s first baptism than itsHigh Priest’s own daughter?Racing only hours before the ceremony, my mother stitched together a red, hoodedrobe for me to wear.I wore a special “kiddie” Baphomet fashioned by Poor Man’s James Bondsurvivalist Kurt Saxon.I am grateful for the fact that I was old enough to remember my baptism vividly.As early as I beganspeaking, my parents and their friends were impressed with my fluency inpronouncing complicateddæmonic names. This came in handy at the baptism, as I recall participating inthe utterance of their names.I knew of course that all of the people packed into the house on that day werethere to pay tribute to me.Sitting high on the altar, I had the perfect vantage-point to survey all mysubjects. Photographers, who hadbegun gathering outside the house at 6 A.M., were now doing anything to getcloser for clear shots of me.After they and the public were finally ushered out of the house, my parents tookme through thetrapdoor from the main ritual chamber to the Den of Iniquity, where a privateparty for me continued untilthe early morning.By late May my serious, cherubic face had been slapped on every magazine andnewspaper fromSweden to Japan, Argentina to Alaska. In the years to come it seemed that themost commonly-askedquestion put to me by [obviously disgusted and prurient] interviewers was: Whatkind of parents would seattheir child before a naked woman? At the time - and today, looking back - I feltabsolutely no shame atsharing the altar with a beautiful woman.Was it chance or destiny that I was born to the High Priest and High Priestessof Satanism, that I wasthe first to be baptized into this remarkable new religion? Nevertheless thesethings happened, and I becamethe first individual in history to exist as a Satanist since birth, with mybaptism my first formal initiation. Ihave always regarded this with the utmost respect and reverence, and have neverfor a moment wavered inunderstanding this to be the definition of my life. 59The baptism was recorded on The Satanic Mass, a phonograph record made for andby the Church andreleased the following year.60 The record also included a composite Satanicritual spoken by Anton,together with readings from the “Book of Satan” of his forthcoming SatanicBible.61Meanwhile Satanism was gaining public attention in still another way. Ira Levin,author of A KissBefore Dying and No Time for Sergeants, had just published a novel calledRosemary’s Baby. The plot, setin a gargoyle-embellished apartment building in New York City, involved anambitious young actor whoconspired with a group of Satanists to breed the Devil’s child by his unknowingwife. 62Rosemary’s Baby appeared at a time when a new topic of conversation wasdemanded, and it swept thecountry. In Hollywood producer William Castle and director Roman Polanski rusheda film version[starring Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes] into production. And now we encounteranother “MM-ism”:the legend that Anton LaVey served as technical advisor for the film and playedthe role of the Devil in it.In the early days of the Church of Satan this claim was accepted as fact, andbecause of the movie’ssensational impact was even paraded as one of Anton’s principal magical coups.Said The Devil’s Avengerin 1974:59 Schreck, Zeena, Commentary to The Church of Satan 3rd Edition to M.A. Aquino,1998.60 “I had a brief, private ritual that I performed nearly every other dayshortly after the release of The Satanic Mass. This consisted of placingthe record on my turntable, centering a figure of the Statue of Liberty over thespindle, and focusing on the spinning statue and the red recordlabel. Finding the track containing my baptism, I would play the ‘Hail Zeena!’incessantly. I don’t know many 3-year-olds experience asmuch ego exaltation and adrenalin-rush from a single event as I did!” Ibid.61 LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Mass (record). San Francisco: Murgenstrumm Records#MM6660, 1968.62 Levin, Ira, Rosemary’s Baby. New York: Random House, 1967.- 42 -In October of 1967 Anton was flown to Hollywood for two weeks. Despite hispresence, theParamount-Polanski film did not convey a true portrait of a modern Satanic cult,although some aspects of itwere accurate. At least the demon used to sire Rosemary’s baby was close tobeing an authentic devil. Itwas Anton, dressed in a costume of latex fur and reptilian scales, a compositeof traditional literarydescriptions of the Devil’s physical attributes. 63Upon close examination, however, this account disintegrates. Rosemary’s BabyProducer WilliamCastle devoted three chapters of his autobiography to the filming of that movie,and nowhere is anyinfluence or contribution by Anton LaVey [or any other occult personality]mentioned. In fact Castlerepeatedly stresses director Polanski’s insistence on filming the novel exactlyas it was written by Levin,omitting only any sight of the baby on camera.64 Nor has Polanski himself, norany other member of thecast or crew, ever mentioned any LaVey involvement.In uncut versions of the movie, two “Devil” eyes momentarily appear - bothduring Rosemary’sravishing and at the end of the film when she sees her baby for the first time -that were rumored to beAnton’s. When RB was eventually released as a videocassette, it became possibleto freeze those framesand examine the eyes closely. They are clearly revealed to be artificial “cat’seyes” with vertical pupils.As for the Devil-suit of fur & scales, it was flown to Louisville, Kentucky in1971 for use in a horror-film ( Asylum of Satan) being shot there for which I was technical advisor. Ihad ample opportunity toexamine it closely. It had to be worn by a woman because of its small size. Thesix-foot, 200-pound LaVeycould not possibly have worn it. 65Many years later Nikolas and Zeena Schreck chanced to meet the father of theactress who played MiaFarrow’s body-double in the RB Devil scene. He recalled that a young, veryslender professional dancerhad worn the suit. The Schrecks had also met Polanski’s close friend GeneGutowski, who had workedwith Polanski on producing the film before Castle took over. Gutowski confirmedthat there was no“technical advisor”, nor did Anton LaVey ever meet Polanski or himself. 66None of the ritual scenes in either the novel or the film of Rosemary’s Babyreflects actual practices ofthe Church of Satan, and the chanting of the coven is not one of the EnochianKeys that later appeared inthe Satanic Bible.Nevertheless the timing of the story - and its highlighting of 1966 as the “YearOne” of the reign of theAntichrist - made a lasting impression upon the Church. Coincidence or allegory?Long after the motionpicture disappeared from theaters, Christopher Komeda’s famous lullaby, sung onthe soundtrack by MiaFarrow, would inspire sentimental emotions in the most worldly of Satanists. 67The Year Two had not yet exhausted its surprises. On December 8 a U.S. NavySeaman, Edward D.Olsen, passed away. It developed that he had been a member of the Church ofSatan and had requested afuneral from same. Anton, accompanied by Ken Anger, officiated at the serviceswith the assistance of aU.S. Navy honor guard. There followed a storm of indignation letters andtelegrams to the Navy and even63 Wolfe, op.cit. , page #188.64 Castle, William, Step Right Up! I’m Gonna Scare the Pants off America. NewYork: Pharos Books, 1992. Among the anecdotes: Polanskioriginally wanted Rosemary & Guy Woodhouse to be played by Tuesday Weld & RobertRedford, and the role of Dr. Saperstein to be playedby Castle himself. [A vestige of this remains in Castle’s cameo appearancestanding next to the phone booth in which Rosemary makes a call.]After the release of the film and its phenomenal success, Castle was swampedwith anonymous death-threat mail from Christian religiousfanatics. Prior to RB Castle was famous as creator of a series of campy,“gimmicked” horror films such as Macabre, House on Haunted Hill (filmed at theEnnis-Brown “Mayan temple” house in Hollywood), The Tingler, and 13 Ghosts.65 Anton LaVey’s height & weight in 1968 (6’/200 lbs) are cited on the jacket ofthe Satanic Mass record.66 Schreck, Zeena, op.cit.67 Komeda, Christopher, Soundtrack of Rosemary’s Baby. Hollywood: Dot Records#DLP-25875, 1968. The Polish-born Komeda had writtenthe scores for most of Roman Polanski’s previous films. He died on April 23,1969, aged 37, from a blood clot in the brain. (Castle, op. cit.,pages #224-225.)- 43 -the White House, but the Church of Satan had struck yet another blow - and asuccessful one - for itslegitimacy. 68By 1968 the Church membership had grown to about fifty or sixty, of which abouthalf would be onhand for the Friday evening rituals. In the month of April the Church wasinfiltrated by a young mannamed Randall H. Alfred, who had determined to make a secret study of it for anacademic paper. Whenthe study finally appeared in 1976, it commented on the evident unattractivenessof Satanism for the youthculture of the day. Only about a third of the 140 Satanists he had met during1968-69, said Alfred, wereunder thirty years of age.69Alfred was well-received by Anton and the Church leadership, and he soon foundhimself a member ofthe council that met on a monthly basis to discuss the local program. In hispaper he observed that thiscouncil was advisory rather than legislative, being overruled by Anton wheneverhe saw fit to do so. 70Randall Alfred may have been the first academician to study the Church of Satan,but he was certainlynot the last. During the following years there ensued a veritable parade ofscholars interested in analyzingthe institution for academic publications. Among them were James Moody, aLecturer in Anthropology atQueens College, Northern Ireland, and Marcello Truzzi, Professor and Chairman ofthe SociologyDepartment of Eastern Michigan University.Moody accepted the Satanic Priesthood, participated enthusiastically in ritualsat 6114, and then fadedfrom active involvement with his return to Ireland in about 1970. In hispublished article concerning hisChurch participation, he stopped short of an unqualified endorsement, but awayfrom the eyes ofcolleagues he was comfortably enthusiastic. In October of 1973 he commented tothe LaVeys that heperceived Anton’s genius to lie in his commitment to intellectual freedom aboveand beyond all acceptedphilosophies. Moody remained, he said, the “loyalest of Anton’s disciples”. Hispassion appeared to bereserved for Anton and Diane as individuals, however, and did not extend topersonal participation in thenational or international programs of the Church. 71Truzzi’s friendship with Anton went back to his pre-Church days, and he too wasa welcome visitor at6114. His sociological discussions of the Church were thoughtful and scholarly,suggesting that in its“elitist, materialist, and basically atheistic philosophy” it constituted an“ultimate pragmatism”. Hepainted a picture of the organization as rejecting spirituality and mysticism infavor of “Machiavellianismand cynical realism” and the worship of Satan as one’s own ego. 72 Anacademically acceptable evaluation,yes - but again one which focused not on the suprarational essence of the Churchbut rather on the rationalprofile it presented to the society whose tolerance it was forced to court.Such anecdotes offer a glimpse of yet another curious contradiction within theChurch of Satan. In itsoriginal denunciation of established religions - all of them, not justChristianity - it attacked not onlyJehovah but all externalized deities as being crippling, imaginary fantasieswith which man hadunnecessarily burdened himself. As Anton put it in an early Church handout[later included in his SatanicBible]:68 Wolfe, op.cit., pages #188-191. Edward Olsen’s grave is located in theCypress Lawn Cemetery, Colma, California - site #1293, MapleMound. The grave bears a plain bronze plaque with no Satanic insignia.69 Alfred, Randall H., “The Church of Satan” in Charles Y. Glock & Robert N.Bellah (Ed.), The New Religious Consciousness.

He has created anentire system of gods withnothing more than his carnal brain. Just because he has an ego and cannot acceptit, he has had toexternalize it into some great spiritual device which he calls “God”.God can do all the things man is forbidden to do - such as kill people, performmiracles to gratify hiswill, control without any apparent responsibility, etc. If man needs such a godand recognizes that god, thenhe is worshipping an entity that a human being invented. Therefore he isworshipping by proxy the manthat invented God. Is it not more sensible to worship a god that he himself hascreated in accordance withhis own emotional needs - one that best represents the very carnal and physicalbeing that has the idea-power to invent a god in the first place?If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of “God”, then whyfear his true self in fearing“God” - why praise his true self in praising “God” - why remain externalizedfrom “God” in order toengage in ritual and religious ceremony in his name?Man needs ritual and dogma, but no law states that an externalized god isnecessary in order to engagein ritual and ceremony performed in a god’s name! Could it be that when hecloses the gap between himselfand his “God”, he sees the dæmon of pride creeping forth - that very embodimentof Lucifer appearing inhis midst? He no longer can view himself in two parts, the carnal and thespiritual, but sees them merge asone; and then, to his abysmal horror, discovers that they are only the carnal -and always were! Then heeither hates himself to death, day by day - or rejoices that he is what he is!If he hates himself, he searches out new and more complex spiritual paths of“enlightenment” in hopesthat he may split himself up again in his quest for stronger and moreexternalized “gods” to scourge hispoor, miserable shell. If he accepts himself but recognizes that ritual andceremony are the importantdevices that his invented religions have utilized to sustain his faith in a lie,then it is the same form ofritual that will sustain his faith in the truth - the primitive pageantry thatwill give his awareness of hisown majestic being added substance.When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closerto himself and fartherfrom “God” - closer to the “Devil”. If this is what the Devil represents, andsuch a man lives his life in theDevil’s fane, with the sinews of Satan moving his flesh, then he either escapesfrom the cacklings andcarpings of the righteous or stands proudly in his secret places of the Earthand manipulates the folly-riddenmasses through his own Satanic might until that day when he may come forth insplendor, proclaiming, “Iam a Satanist! Bow down, for I am the highest embodiment of human life! ” 73By these criteria, then, the Church of Satan was not a church in the precisesense of the term, nor did itworship Satan as an existential being in his own right. Rather it was atheismwith psychodrama. As Truzzicorrectly observed, that was something which could be credibly argued toskeptical audiences.There was, however, a problem: Satanists participating in rituals of Black Magicquickly becameaware of an “interest” or “influence” in the atmosphere of the chamber that feltsomehow alien to theirown personalities. The pageantry and the oratory would fade into the background,and the participantswould find themselves gripped in a sensory empathy so piercing, so powerful thatit would leave themexhausted, drained, and shaken at the conclusion of the rite. It was not achance occurrence, but aninevitable, recurring one. After such experiences participants were subdued,introspective, and disinclinedto exchange comments on their feelings. There was perhaps even a slight feelingof embarrassment, asthough one had somehow “slipped” from being a proper psychodramatic atheist.And Anton LaVey was himself the most familiar with this sensation. His behaviorduring a ritual wasnot that of an actor, nor of a megalomaniac, but rather of a High Priest in thesincere sense. In public andto less experienced Satanists he would continue to “excuse” the Church of Satanas atheism-with-frills, butalone with intimates he would speak of Satan, the Church, and his own officetherein with the greatestreverence and respect. He did not “believe” after the fashion of the ordinarymystic or fanatic; hecontinued to have a healthy contempt for such types. It would be more accurateto say that he had73 LaVey, Anton, “The God You Save May Be Yourself”. Mimeographed handout of theChurch of Satan ca. III/1968, later included in theSatanic Bible.- 45 -achieved a very deep understanding of a remote, rarely-penetrated part ofexistence in which intelligenceand will besides those of mankind exist. Nor did he “worship” this otheressence; rather he empathizedand communed with it. And so these two forces - the atheistic and the Satanic -coexisted in varyingproportions for the entire duration of the Church of Satan. One would expectthem ultimately to conflictand provoke the final crisis, but that did not prove to be the case. Theatheistic argument entered that crisisonly as a later rationalization, for by that time it had long ceased to be takenseriously within the Church.From 1966 until 1970 rituals for members of the Church of Satan were held eachFriday night at 6114.The majority of members were residents of the San Francisco bay area, thoughout-of-towners were alsowelcome to attend. As yet there were no active clergy or organized units outsideof San Francisco.Participants would generally arrive at 10:30 P.M. or so and socialize in thePurple Room until it wastime for the ritual. At midnight they would file into the main ritual chamber,and after 5-15 minutes of“intellectual decompression” via darkness and mood-setting music [by recordingor by Anton or anotherlive organist], the ceremony would begin. It would last up to an hour, whereuponthe membership wouldreturn to the Purple Room for further conversation and refreshments. The lastvisitor might not departuntil close to dawn.Of what did the early rituals consist? Their nature varied from straightforwardSatanic Mass - beingceremonial devotions to and requests of Satan and/or other dæmons - toelaborate, imaginativepsychodramas. On occasion abbreviated Black Masses (satires on Catholicceremonies) were held, butonly one complete Black Mass - the Missa Solemnis - was ever conducted at 6114California Street - inJune of 1970.In a 1968 mimeographed monograph Anton set forth the design and principles ofthe Satanic Mass andthe magic utilized during it. This monograph - the original statement ofprinciples of the Church of Satan -would later become the basis for the Satanic Bible. [It is reproduced in full asAppendix #1.]The principal psychodramatic rituals of the original Church are reproduced asAppendices #2-6. Inrevised and expanded forms, most of these rituals would later appear in LaVey’sSatanic Rituals,published in 1972. The versions shown here are from the original [andexceedingly rare] ritual booklet ofthe Church, copies of which went to a select few of the Priesthood in 1970.These are also the versionswhich were actually performed at 6114 California Street.The text of the Black Mass ( Missa Solemnis) also appeared in a drasticallyrevised form in the SatanicRituals, since the text as actually used at 6114 was thought too shocking forpublic consumption.Appendix #7 contains the full text of the original Missa Solemnis [again from anexceedingly rare 1970ritual booklet].- 46 -[index-47_1.jpg]- 47 -For the first three years of its existence, the Church of Satan remainedessentially a San Franciscophenomenon. All of its functions took place at 6114 California Street, andmembers were active onlyinsofar as they could visit the city for classes, discussions, or rituals. Butas word of this novel institutionbegan to circulate outside the Bay Area, membership inquiries from elsewherebegan to arrive in the mail.Anton LaVey was faced with the decision whether to remain the leader of atangible, face-to-facegroup or to assume a remote, supervisory role over a more far-flung institution.Necessarily he chose thelatter, but the transition was neither quick nor easy. The psychologicaldimension of Satanism dependedvery strongly upon personal contact, and it was not certain that correspondencecould be as effective.Then there was the question of ritual facilities. Could psychodramas and magicalworkings conceivedfor 6114 be successfully transposed to more modest surroundings, or would theythen lose theiratmosphere and seem artificial, if not ludicrous?Expansion began with simple correspondence memberships. A mimeograph machine wasacquired; theblandness of its printing was immediately overwhelmed by paper in all colors ofthe rainbow. Anton’s1969 cover letter to enquirers said:Enclosed is the information which you have requested. Thank you for yourinterest, and congratulationson having the courage to seek the truth about Satanism.After reading the information on Satanism, you may feel that it is the religionfor which you have beensearching, or possibly the one you have been practicing in an “underground” wayfor years. If you wish tojoin the Church of Satan, please fill out the enclosed questionnaire and send italong with your initiation feeof $13, and you will become a part of the most exciting concept in religion inthe world today. Upon receiptof your completed questionnaire and initiation fee, you will receive thefollowing:1 - Lifetime membership in the Church of Satan. (There are no periodic dues;your initial fee is the onlypayment you make for lifetime membership.)2 - A suitably inscribed membership card of a striking appearance.3 - Complete instructions for performing authentic Satanic rituals (see enclosedpaper for fulldescription).4 - A list (revised bimonthly) of other members with whom you may communicate.This list includesnot only names, addresses, and phone numbers, but also marital status, age, sex,and interests of eachmember listed.5 - Past newsletters containing pertinent information for all Satanists andannouncements of scheduledpress coverage.6 - A reading list of readily obtainable books and/or articles on Satanism andrelated subjects. (This listwill have bimonthly additions.)As a member of the Church of Satan, you will have the opportunity to:1 - Overcome any obstacle through the ability to control people and events.2 - Embark on a series of studies unlike any other correspondence course everoffered to students ofSatanic science. (This course is offered only to members of the Church of Satan.The material it contains is- 48 -not the hackneyed lore usually found in readily available books and journals onwitchcraft and Satanism.The Satanic Study Course consists of twenty separate essays covering all aspectsof the Satanic religion. Acomplete list of topics and a full description of the course will be sent to allnew members.)3 - Study for the Satanic Priesthood. (Full details will be sent to newmembers.)The Church of Satan has become a legend in an incredibly short period of time.There is good reasonfor this. It is because Satanism makes sense but still realizes man’s need forgood, honest emotion.We Satanists are winners - not losers! The die has been cast. The Satanic Age isupon us; look aroundyou and you’ll see! What we already are is what other religions are feeblypussyfooting around in attemptsto become. Join us and be a part of history! I would be happy to hear from youin the near future.Most sincerely,Anton Szandor LaVey, High PriestTwo features of this letter are particularly significant: (1) the low lifetimemembership fee andrenunciation of dues income, and (2) the membership communication roster. Tothose who would latercondemn the original Church as financial opportunism and/or as a means for AntonLaVey’s self-glorification, here are the refutations. It is true that both of these policieswere eventually changed, but inthose innocent, idealistic days of the Year Three, the Church of Satan wasenergized solely by the strengthof its exciting vision.In March of that year, after nine months’ service as a Lieutenant in the 1/17thCavalry Squadron of the82nd Airborne Division, I flew home to San Francisco to be married. Hungry for adose of countercultureto offset the effects of paratrooper regimentation, I leafed through theBerkeley Barb - the grandfather ofBay Area “underground” newspapers - and saw an advertisement for one of theevening lectures at 6114.It was too unique to pass up, so with my fiancée and a small party of friends, Iset out for the black house.The door opened moments before I could reach for the bell, and standing withinwas a pale, dark-haired man clad in priestly robes. He beckoned us to enter and gestured towardsan ornate guest book on atable in the entrance hall (next to the stuffed jaguar).This was too much for one of the girls. She stared fearfully at our ghostlyguide and shook her head.“Never mind,” intoned the spectre calmly. “We know who you are ...” It was all Icould do to keep herfrom bolting then and there! Later I would come to know our host as John A.Ferro, Lecturer in History atthe University of San Francisco and Anton’s principal deputy. He proved to be abrilliant and sensitiveacademician with a manner more kindly than one might first suspect. But for themoment he was properlyterrifying. We followed him into the main ritual chamber, which had beentransformed into a small lecturehall by the addition of rows of folding chairs.It is difficult to convey the effect of such a singular decor upon theconventional psyche. The roomappeared as might a monstrous collaboration by Walt Disney, Charles Addams,Erich von Stroheim, andDr. Caligari. As we sat facing an organ console that would have warmed the heartof Captain Nemo, thestuffed owl atop the oversized (for the “Stifling Air”) coffin glareddisapprovingly at our profane intrusion.As garish and outrageous as it was, the room was thoroughly intimidating. Itsatmosphere had beenorchestrated so completely that not a hint remained of the mundane worldoutside. On the other side of theshuttered windows, San Francisco was going about its evening business; but herein this bizarre chamberwe were whirled away to a Twilight Zone where devils were real.Casting about for some anchor of normalcy, my gaze fell upon an ashtray from -of all places! - theFranciscan Restaurant on Fishermen’s Wharf resting on the organ console.Idiotically I felt reassured.Anyone who takes restaurant ashtrays with fat monks on them, I mused, can’t beall bad.The mummy-door creaked open, and Anton Szandor LaVey entered. He was tall -about six feet - andstockily built without being fat. As he stalked towards the front of the room,one was reminded of agrizzly bear on its hind legs. But the man was obviously not posturing; hismanner was relaxed and hissmile open and infectious. It was evident that he enjoyed himself and what hewas doing; he did notradiate the defensiveness of the privately-self-acknowledged charlatan. And thisrelaxed self-confidencemade him all the more intriguing.- 49 -That evening’s lecture was the one on fortune-telling and character analysis(see Chapter #2). Thediscussion itself was scholarly and straightforward, but the surroundings andthe appearance of thelecturer kept crazily intruding. It is difficult to reflect dispassionately onthe merits of tea-leaf reading orpalmistry, after all, when the lecturer looks like a reincarnation of Ming theMerciless or Dr. Fu Manchu.One half-expected him to say: “That concludes the lecture; now we’ll kill one ofyou for the fun of it andthen the rest may enjoy complimentary coffee and doughnuts before leaving.”As he talked about life-lines and phrenological indentations, I found myselflosing interest in thelecture. I was increasingly fascinated by this strange man. Emperor Norton witha pitchfork he wasn’t. Hiseyes glowed with a smile - which John Fowles described in The Magus ascharacterizing an archaic Greekbust: “a smile that would have been smug if it had not been so full of thepurest metaphysical good humor… above all the smile of dramatic irony, of those who have privilegedinformation”.74After the lecture had given way to coffee ( sans sacrifice), I introduced myselfand enquired if I mightobtain further information about the Church of Satan. When I left the blackhouse, I had with me themonograph and the rainbow-colored informational papers.The monograph struck me as an odd mixture of common sense and “crazy occultism”.The attacks onconventional religious taboos were sensible enough, but when the text turned toclaims concerning theobjective powers of ritual magic, I sniffed at it skeptically.Nevertheless I couldn’t forget that smile of dramatic irony. By whatever means,Anton LaVey hadmanaged to apprehend something very profound concerning the riddle of humanexistence. The more Ithought about it, the more I became convinced that I wanted to share in thatdiscovery.Arguments from parents and friends were rational and forceful: “Taint yourselfwith something likeSatanism and you’ll condemn yourself to a life of prejudicial discrimination, nomatter what the merit ofthe thing itself may be.”I could not deny the practicality of such advice and did not try to. It drovehome to me the seriousnessof the choice that I now faced: to maximize my lifelong comforts in conventionalsociety or to risk thosecomforts for knowledge feared and forbidden by that society. I could not evenjudge the value of thatknowledge [since I did not yet possess it]; all I had to go on was Anton LaVey’ssmile.It may seem odd to make a decision of lifelong consequence on the basis of afacial expression. But Ifound myself wondering: Why this effort of life that is mine? What justifies it?Simply the comfortableexistence of the organism containing my consciousness? Ego-gratificationresulting from power over andrespect by other organisms? When the time came for my respiration and metabolismto fail, would I beable to die satisfied that I had made the most of the privilege of independentintellectual existence? If Icould answer “yes”, then it would seem to be eminently prudent to turn my backon the Church of Satan.“For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall beopened, and ye shall be asgods, knowing good and evil.”I reached out and took the apple. Indeed, as for Adam and Eve, there was neverreally a choice oncethe question had been posed and appreciated. The “evil” in Eden was presentbefore the serpent arrived; itwas implicit in the capacity of humanity to understand what the serpent wasoffering.There was an amusing postscript to that episode in San Francisco. Though Janet,my fiancée, was anominal Mormon and I was what could only be termed a disinterested agnostic, weagreed to a Baptistceremony to satisfy parental desires for pageantry. My mother, possessed of aconspiratorial sense ofhumor, surreptitiously invited Anton to the reception. “Understand,” he said toher on the telephone, “Ishall not appear in a puff of smoke!” From the Baptist minister’s self-satisfiedsmile at that reception, itwas evident that he felt he had done God’s work well - right up to the momentwhen the High Priest of the74 Fowles, John, The Magus. Boston: Little, Brown & Company, 1965, pages#142-143.- 50 -Church of Satan walked through the door - whereupon said minister turned sicklywhite, left abruptly, andwas never heard from by us again.Back at Fort Bragg, North Carolina Janet and I sent in our applications. Apersonal letter of welcomearrived from Anton LaVey a short time later:I am most impressed with the data on your questionnaires and wish to take thisopportunity topersonally welcome you both to our Order. Our conversation at your weddingreception and the viewsexpressed on your questionnaires served only to support my initial impression,received during our firstmeeting, that you would be extremely worthwhile additions to the membership ofthe Church of Satan. It isindeed refreshing to find people in your age group who can reject the follies ofoutmoded beliefs while stillrecognizing the need for established social structure.I found your parents and friends to be very gracious and charming, andthoroughly enjoyed the eveningspent with them. Please give my best regards to your parents when you nextcommunicate with them. I wishyou and your lovely wife all the delights of the Elysian Empire. 75With the letter came membership packets consisting of copies of the Church’snewly-started newsletter( From the Devil’s Notebook), black-&-silver-on-red membership cards proclaimingthe holder a “Citizenof the Infernal Empire”, and a mimeographed page of ritual magic instructions.Those familiar with medieval grimoires or the magical texts of modern fraternaloccultism know howconfusing, involved, impractical (“get the left hand of a hanged murderer”), andfrustrating ritualinstructions can be. And the ceremonies which can be performed are generally forsuch childish purposesas to insult if not disgust the post-adolescent mentality.On the other hand Anton’s instructions were so straightforward that one feltinitial disappointment atthe lack of suitable mumbo-jumbo. In essence he said:1. Furnish a room with certain necessary implements and designs. These includean altar, a bell for thesymbolic banishing of outside influences, a sword for focusing the attention andwill, a goblet or chalice fora drink in communion with the Powers of Darkness, black candles forillumination, a white candle fordestruction or curse workings, and the Sigil of Baphomet above the altar toprovide a visual focus for thecelebrant’s invocation of Satan.2. Dress in attire suitable to the ritual atmosphere. As is the case with theritual chamber, suchpreparation is as much to disassociate the celebrant from the reminders ofmundane existence as to impressa diabolical audience.3. Shut out the outside world by sealing the ritual chamber. Cover externallight sources. Overpowerexternal sounds with the ringing of the bell and controlled music.4. Invoke Satan and such other Infernal entities as are appropriate to thespecific working. Acknowledgeyour alliance with them ceremonially by drinking from the chalice.5. State your desire or convey it by nonverbal means.6. Ennoble it by the utterance of an appropriate ceremonial passage.7. Renew your devotion to Satan.8. Ceremonially end the working. Depurify the chamber by allowing naturalphenomena once more toenter its atmosphere.Somewhat self-consciously I constructed a makeshift altar in the spare bedroomin my Army officer’sduplex at 156 North Dougherty Street. The room, otherwise bare and “governmentissue”, was hardly asexotic as 6114’s ritual chamber; even the Sigil of Baphomet was a simplepainting on black felt. I closedthe door and did not reenter it until the late evening.When I did reenter the room, I received a most unexpected surprise. The wholehad become more thanthe sum of the parts; there was now … “something” … about the place that had notbeen there before. I75 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 8, IV/1969.- 51 -turned to Janet; she had sensed it too without a word passing between us. Wedonned black garb, returnedto the room, and commenced an initial ritual whose object was simply anaffirmation of our commitmentto Satan and the Powers of Darkness.For the first time I experienced that curious sensation which has since becomeso familiar to me:It is next to impossible to describe the sensations of Black Magical ritual tosomeone who has notparticipated in it - and it is unnecessary to do so to those who have. But Ishall venture this approximation:It is as though the individual undergoes a form of “mental displacement”. Thephysical environment isunchanged, the celebrant remains alert and in control of himself, but …something is different. The mindis suddenly aware, if only by a sort of peripheral perception, of forces andinfluences in the atmospherewhich are undetectable under normal circumstances. Moreover the mind issensitive to a link which itopens with these forces and influences - a link which may be nebulous but whichquite definitely exists.Basic magical ritual, then, becomes an exercise in which one struggles todefine, strengthen, and applythat link.It was exhilarating, intoxicating, and - I will admit it - unnerving. I havemade tactical parachute jumpsat night with Special Forces teams that weren’t half so electrifying. Physicaldanger is at least somethingconcrete which can be accepted and addressed by the mind in a logical oremotional manner, but theatmosphere of a ritual is a danger far more profound and primal. Yawning pits ofinfinite darkness seem toopen before the naked consciousness, and the magician struggles desperately fora law upon which thenormal, natural functions of his mind can grasp. It is not hallucination ormadness in the vulgar sense,because one’s normal perceptions and thought-mannerisms are neither abandonednor distorted. It is ratherthat something else is added to them. A citizen of the country of the blindacquires an eye.Walpurgisnacht (April 30) was not far away. I invited two fellow Lieutenants tojoin us in a modestBlack Mass - not the Missa Solemnis (which had not yet been composed) but asimple psychodramasatirizing the more ridiculous taboos of Western religious tradition.No toads were crucified that night, no virgins violated with turnips, butMussorgsky would not havebeen disappointed with our thunderous declarations and incantations. Theexperience proved too much forour guests; although seasoned military veterans, they were shaken by what theyhad unexpectedly arousedwithin themselves and refused to return. But I was even more intrigued; I haddiscovered the subjectivepower of psychodrama. It cleared the psyche of obsessions both conscious andsubconscious, leaving onesupremely refreshed and invigorated. It was a thrilling sensation which did notdissipate for daysafterwards. Anton LaVey commented:Your Walpurgisnacht ceremony was a good step forward, as it held a threefoldpurpose. First it gaveyou an opportunity to introduce a couple of others to our philosophy (which I’msure must have prefacedthe ritual), and you were able to observe their reactions to Satanic ritual. Italso gave you a chance to act inthe capacity of Priest and test your dramatic ability. I’m glad to hear it wentwell, as will, I’m certain, anyfurther meetings with select individuals. You are wise to choose your initiateswell and desensitize a few ata time, for they will open the way for other, perhaps less brave individuals. 76The Church of Satan, I now knew, was not a church in which I could be satisfiedas a lay member.Having awakened something in my consciousness whose existence I had neversuspected, I now - like Dr.Frankenstein - wanted to see it “at its full power”. I turned to a mimeographedsheet of red paper that hadbeen included with the membership packet. It was entitled “Requirements for theSatanic Clergy” and isreproduced in full as Appendix #8.I wrote to Anton that although I aspired to the Priesthood, I was doubtful thatthe Army would be verycomfortable with even a single Satanic chaplain. Therefore it seemed prudent toundertake such a Satanicoffice in addition to my secular profession rather than in lieu of it. Hereplied:76 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 16, IV/1969.- 52 -I am pleased that you have found Satanism to be in accordance with your ownopinions and needs, andam highly impressed with your comments concerning the Satanic philosophy.I can certainly sympathize with your position in the service and in yourcommunity, and fully agree thatit would be folly for you to indiscriminately “preach” Satanism to closed-mindedindividuals. I do,nevertheless, sincerely appreciate your desire to further the cause.You mentioned that upon your return to San Francisco in June 1970 you would liketo study for theSatanic Priesthood. As I think you know, the Satanic Bible will be released thisfall; so with the basicknowledge of Satanism it will provide, it will greatly help to start you on yourway to becoming a SatanicPriest. The material contained in the Satanic Bible will, of course, be publicknowledge. But the degree towhich people will benefit from it will vary a great deal. People such asyourself will derive muchknowledge and understanding from the book and - what’s more important - will beable to put into practicewhat they have learned. This will lay the much-needed groundwork for theadvanced training I will giveyou, and even before we arrive at that point, the approximate six months betweenthe time the Bible isreleased and you return to San Francisco will give you an excellent opportunityto absorb and test thedoctrines of Satanism. Naturally this will make my eventual personal tutoring ofyou far more meaningfuland beneficial.I think your idea of becoming the first Satanic chaplain is delightful, and eventhough I look upon thiseventuality with the utmost seriousness, I also can see many amusing aspectswhich will undoubtedly result.Not many people are aware of this, but when Jayne Mansfield (who was a member ofthe Church of Satan)was on tour in Vietnam, she was asked which type of chaplain she wished forSunday services. When shereplied that she was a Satanist and a Satanic chaplain was the only kind thatwould do, they actually sentout a search-party to find one! Needless to say, they did not succeed - but itcertainly stirred things up forawhile.Until the Satanic Bible is released, you might find my weekly column in theNational Insider to be ofsome value. Although the Insider is a rather lurid tabloid, I still try toproduce some useful information. Itmust, of course, be written in terms that are conducive to selling that kind ofpaper; but in some ways thiscan be an asset rather than a detriment since I don’t have to mince words. Italso allows me to write in acontemporary style without having to concern myself with whether it will bedated in twenty years. Thiswas the most difficult part of writing the Bible. It is next to impossible toexpound on current situations andthe need for change without becoming specific to such a degree that would makethe comments seem datedin a very short time. The Insider is also valuable because the editors don’talter my work and will print anymaterial I give them. 77From April through June I had been undergoing specialized training as aPsychological Operations(PSYOP) Officer, and in June I was assigned to the 6th PSYOP Battalion in IIICorps Tactical Zone, SouthVietnam - first managing quick-reaction propaganda production for U.S. andVietnamese units, then flyingcombat air-support PSYOP missions with the Air Force, directing the tacticalPSYOP teams of the 1stInfantry Division, and working on classified Special Operations projects. Myambitions to qualify as anofficial Satanic chaplain, however, were frustrated by Army policies assigningchaplain slots bypercentages of soldiers professing those denominations. Anton was conciliatorybut far from pessimistic:I can readily understand what you are up against concerning the Chaplaincy inthe Armed Forces. AsI’ve said in the past, I wouldn’t consider asking, much less expecting you toplace yourself or Janet in aposition which could be injurious to your reputation or status in the militaryor in your personal life. So fornow it is best for you to continue any desensitization of others in an“underground” manner. It is obvious tome that I need not caution you as to when it is best to open up and when toremain silent. Much as it wouldappear otherwise, though, I anticipate a rapid disintegration of the status quoof religious intimidation, evenin areas such as the military.77 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 17, IV/1969.- 53 -To sum up our political doctrine: Satanism is Americanism in its purest form,with only the outdatedmoral codes altered to fit the times and with recognition of the fact that onlyif man’s most basic instinctsare satisfied, can a nation receive his best.When it becomes common knowledge that we do not advocate or even approve ofdenial or desecrationof such sacred American traditions as home, family, patriotism, personal pride,etc. but instead championthese things, our one-time opponents in the “establishment” will not have a legon which to stand.Actually, in view of the vast numbers of religious leaders defending andexpounding the extreme liberalphilosophy of the hippie or drug culture, conservative organizations will find[and already have found]Satanism far more compatible with their doctrines than they now think it to be.I feel rather sorry for - but, Imust admit, also amused by - the poor old “dyed-in-the-wool” conservatives whoconsider The Flag andGod to be inseparable institutions, because the “New Christianity” is composedof the drug-befuddledwretches they find totally reprehensible. It looks as though one is going to beforced to choose between Godand The Flag or else become part of a dying society.I realize most would think me far too optimistic, but I simply can see thechange coming. I’ve beenridiculed all my life for my “crackpot” notions and outrageous actions, but haveinvariably had the lastlaugh on those who have stuck around long enough to see the manifestation ofthose so-called crackpottheories - and this is no exception!Think back just three and a half short years ago when I formally founded theChurch. How manytheologians were admitting to the irrationality and inconsistencies of theirreligions? Practically none! Andonce the stern, unyielding Christian churches have admitted their errors, theymight as well admit to defeat.Considering the vast change that has taken place in the past three years, it isbrain-boggling to think of whatthe next three will bring - especially now, since the floodgates have beenopened.Enough of the Satanic discourse. I merely want to impress upon you that themighty roar of the basiliskwill resound with noisome mirth when the temples of self-denial come tumblingdown and his fatal glancestills the wagging tongues of those who would have man grovel before an image ofmartyrdom and demeanhimself by praying to one who cares not about him. Yes, the time is nigh!May the Dark Forces within and without you bring you increase. 78I couldn’t help wondering whether the basilisk might be warming to the task byencouragingVietnamese Buddhists to set fire to themselves. But the more I thought aboutAnton’s “political doctrine”,the more I empathized with it. The Vietnam war had fueled the cynicism anddisillusionment of manyyoung Americans towards the morals of their government; and organized religion,instead of spearheadingthe quest for greater honesty and compassion, had evaded the issue with cheaprationalizations. Thecomparatively few religious leaders who had dared to take more than a rhetoricalstand against the statusquo, such as the Berrigans, were brusquely dismissed as “rebels” and “renegades”by their superiors. Itwas discouraging and disgusting, and I for one was not surprised that the drugculture had arisen as a formof spiritual suicide. If Anton LaVey were a crackpot, I thought, then we coulddo with a few morecrackpots - and I said so. His reply was not long in coming:I thank you for your gracious compliments and am pleased that you found my“diatribe” in accordancewith your own thoughts. Yes, I am quite accustomed to being labeled a“crackpot”, but it is with fiendishdelight that I have found the name “madman” is rapidly replacing the former. Ifind it far more satisfying tobe considered a villain than a fool, as the transition from villain to hero ismore easily accomplished thanfrom fool to hero. [See Orrin E. Klapp’s Heroes, Villains, and Fools.]Incidentally I found that Satanism was very well received - actually championed- at the sociologyconvention which was held in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago. With notedsociologists proudlysporting buttons “Pray for Anton LaVey” and “Satanism is Alive and Well in SanFrancisco” during the78 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, July 28, IV/1969.- 54 -two-week run of the convention, it became most evident that this particulargroup of trend-setters will do usjustice in the months and years to come. 79The “Pray” button - being a takeoff on the “Pray for Rosemary’s Baby” sloganthat had accompaniedthat movie’s release - reminded me of the circumstances under which I had firstseen him. I wrote him anaccount of that evening at the Marina Theater, commenting on the crowd’sbehavior from a PSYOP pointof view. He replied:I was amused by your description of the crowd’s reaction to my presence at theopening of Rosemary’sBaby. I must admit I rather enjoy striking terror into the hearts of thosemild-mannered souls whosecollective unconscious produces that reaction.I’ve been accused of having a jaded, Machiavellian sense of humor, and I supposeI do. As one reporteronce wrote when commenting on various props in my house which are obviouslythere for fun: “A grimsorcerer would be unbearable.” I agree, even though I realize there is a timefor decorum and a time forletting one’s hair down; and I am a near fanatic when it comes to separating thetwo.At any rate I’m pleased that the theater incident led you to the Church, eventhough I have no doubt thatyou would have eventually found your way here anyway. It seems that the rightpeople do, one way oranother.I was highly intrigued by your description of PSYOP and noted with particularpleasure that youreferred to “weaknesses of the mind”, which of course evokes much Satanicrumination on my part. Were itnot for the only-too-obvious weaknesses of mind prevalent in the popularmajority, past religions couldnever have achieved the stronghold they have had for far too long.It somewhat saddens me to realize that even when you offer the masses somethingbetter and a choicebetween freedom and bondage with regard to religion or even just a way of life,most will choose bondage.My only consolation, though, is that now people have a choice, and those worthyof consideration andcapable of emancipation have somewhere to turn. As far as the rest areconcerned, if they need a villain tofulfill their masochistic psychological needs, then I’m glad to oblige!80On August 9 Sharon Tate and her guests had been murdered by the Charles Manson“family”, and thecryptic scrawls left by the murderers and the ritualistic aspect of the killingsthemselves had much of thepress speculating that “Satanism” was to blame. I had asked Anton whether heknew anything the mediadidn’t, and now he replied:Yes, I have very definite views on the Sharon Tate case, but none I care tostate in a letter. Suffice to sayit was a case of several people playing ball on the wrong team and notacknowledging the coach. When youreturn to San Francisco next year, I’ll elucidate further on this. I will say,though, that there are manystrange coincidences surrounding the case which I’m certain have escapedrecognition by those concernedwith the investigation.81I doubt that Anton LaVey knew anything more than anyone else about the killingsbefore SusanAtkins’ surprising revelation of responsibility the following month (11/6/69).More likely he was simplyworried that if some crazy cult had done the murders, public backlash mightimpact the Church of Satan.Once the Manson Family was identified and arrested, of course, he had much morereason to be upset.Not only had Susan Atkins been involved with the Church, but another Familymember, BobbyBeausoleil, had been a close associate of Ken Anger. Beausoleil had beenintroduced to Black Magic byAnger in 1967, when the two of them were living together in an old San Franciscohouse called the79 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 13, IV/1969.80 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 14, IV/1969.81 Ibid.- 55 -“Russian Embassy”.82 After filming the Crowleyesque Inauguration of the PleasureDome at SamsonDeBrier’s 6114-like salon in Los Angeles in 1956, Anger had become increasinglyfascinated withCrowley’s legacy, even traveling to the Sicilian town of Cefalu to seek out andrestore the exotic muralswhich “the Great Wild Beast” had painted on the walls of his Abbey of Thelema.83 Now Anger invitedBeausoleil to play the Devil in a new Satanic film entitled Lucifer Rising,which was eventually releasedin 1969 as Invocation of my Demon Brother. Anton LaVey also made an appearanceas High Priest in thatfilm.84Beausoleil may also have participated in Church of Satan activities. Said EdSanders in The Family:“Robert Beausoleil, who would later murder Gary Hinman, had extensive contactwith a Devil-worshipping cult operating in San Francisco in 1966 and 1967.” 85In October 1967, two months before he would assist Anton at the funeral ofEdward Olsen, Ken Angertraveled to Washington to assist in the famous “exorcism of the Pentagon” byconducting a ritual beneatha truck parked in front of that worthy [and still rather possessed] edifice.Relates Sanders:While various Diggers and exorcists were standing atop the flat-bed truckscreeching “Out, demons,out”, Anger, bare from the waist up, revealing what appeared to be a tattoo ofLucifer upon his chest,burned a picture of the Devil within a consecrated pentagram, shouting oaths andhissing as he flashed amagic ring at inquiring reporters thrusting microphones at him hunched down inthe gravel. 86While Anger was thus preoccupied, Beausoleil supposedly absconded with equipmentand footagefrom Lucifer Rising, so infuriating Anger that he concocted a cursed locket totransform him into a toad. 87Shortly after the funeral of Olsen, Kenneth Anger also parted from the Church ofSatan. 88Yet another murderer had attended the Church of Satan in its very first year ofexistence. Tom Creechhad not joined the Church, but he would later state that in 1974 he and twoothers provided eight younggirls for a cult in the Seattle suburb of Burien that practiced human sacrifice.In October 1975 Creech wasconvicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to hang. 89On June 21, 1975 - the day before the North Solstice - a 16-year-old TerraLinda, California girlnamed Marlene Olive murdered her parents. Although never a member of the Churchof Satan, Marlenehad become fascinated by the Satanic Bible’s strong statements concerning humansacrifice and revenge.To her friends she had remarked that she was indeed an initiate of the Church,and her room had beendecorated with candles, incense burners, and pentagram. 90Such incidents dramatized a problem which the Church of Satan would nevercompletely succeed insolving, though it certainly tried. While Anton LaVey conceptualized the Churchand its philosophy assomething positive and constructive, unchained to old definitions andstereotypes, many of those whosought out the institution did not draw that distinction. For them Satanism wasthe Satanism of La-Bas or82 Sanders, Ed, The Family. New York: Avon Books #M110, 1971, page #49.83 Lamparski, Richard, Lamparski’s Hidden Hollywood.

Theysaw in Anton LaVey whatthey wanted to see in him - a god-figure who would not only forgive “HelterSkelter” but encourage it.Thus Anton learned that he would have two hurdles to surmount: First he wouldhave to build andsustain the integrity and reputation of the Church of Satan itself, and secondlyhe would have to combatthe old, Christian stereotype of Satanism.For every Susan Atkins or Tom Creech who might enter the door of 6114 CaliforniaStreet, manypsychotics, criminals, and destructive deviants would be pinpointed and deniedentrance. As the Churchbecame more sophisticated, the problem lessened, but was a constant concern ofthe Priesthood during theChurch’s entire span of existence.Letters from Anton LaVey were no less exotic than anything else connected withhis lifestyle. A goodthird of the space on the red or purple stationery was occupied by a spiderweb(inhabited), the alchemicalsymbol for brimstone, an ornate rendering of the name of the Church, a trident,and a dragon curledaround the Sigil of Baphomet.Receiving such missives at combat outposts in the Vietnamese jungle - anenvironment also unlike thatof polite American society - was a somewhat surrealistic experience. Thestresses of the war had the effectof placing me at a psychological as well as a physical distance from Westerncultural norms. I felt movedto comment on them in light of my investigations and experiences of the past fewmonths, and so - on abattered old typewriter in the village of Ben Cat - I composed a position paperwhich I decided to title TheSatanic Ultimatum (Appendix #9). Off it went to San Francisco, and back came areply from the ghostlyhost of our evening lecture:It was with the greatest pleasure and admiration that His Excellency the HighPriest received and readthe essay which you forwarded to him. He graciously passed it on to me, and Ican but add mycommendations to his.The synthesis you provide is obviously the result of many years’ study andthought encompassingphilosophy, history, literature, anthropology, and politics. Its statement waspithy and clear; its message washeartening and inspirational.You comprehend Satanism with rare understanding, and you express your thoughtwith equally rareincisiveness. For this reason we hope to present your essay in the newsletterdispatched to all our members,though it will necessarily be in installments. It is to be hoped that this inturn meets with your approval.There is no doubt but that our members will profit by your essay, and it willreflect well upon the Church topublish such material.The High Priest is most pleased with your progress and your work, and he hasdirected me to conveythose sentiments to you on his behalf. He considers you an eminently qualifiedcandidate for the SatanicPriesthood and has taken unusual personal interest in your development. Needlessto say, your letters arealways received with pleasure and satisfaction…In the service of the Prince of Darkness,Reverend John A. Ferro91Such was my first epistolary encounter with John Ferro, at whose melodic commandof English Iwould never cease to marvel. Writing to thank him, I commented:Of course the Ultimatum is only an initial outline. Each component area merits amore thoroughexamination, and my next project is accordingly the designing of an extensivedoctrinal paper. With ameasure of luck I hope to finish this work by the time of my return to theUnited States this coming June -provided the North Vietnamese rocket attacks aren’t overly enthusiastic! Itdisrupts one’s train of thoughtwhen one must dive for a bomb shelter. 9291 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, November 22, IV/1969.92 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John Ferro, December 10, IV/1969.[index-57_1.jpg]- 57 -As recounted in Chapter #3, the Church of Satan came into being almost byaccident. The organizationwas not the result of a preexisting belief system or inspirational writtenmanifesto by anyone involved inits founding. Once it was organized, holding activities, and giving public voiceon behalf of the Devil’sphilosophy, it obviously became somewhat pressing to codify what that philosophymight be.Anton LaVey’s first attempt at this was a 1968 mimeographed monograph (Appendix#1), along withan assortment of polemical essays on multicolored paper - what were colloquiallyknown as the “rainbowsheets”. These were issued to new Satanists as well as to curiousrepresentatives of the press.That same year an Avon Books editor named Peter Mayer heard about Anton and hisstrange Church,and decided that, in the wake of the spectacular sales success of Rosemary’sBaby and the consequentrevival of popular interest in the occult, the time was right for a “Satanicbible”. He proposed that Antonauthor it.The LaVeys gathered together and revised the monograph and the rainbow sheets,as well as theChurch handout describing ritual magic instructions. “I pounded out the SatanicBible on a $29typewriter,” recalled Diane. “I edited it and added to it.” 93 But more wasneeded in order to produce asufficiently-fat paperback, and Mayer’s deadline loomed.Therefore to the beginning of the book Anton added an extensive diatribe from anobscure, turn-of-the-century political tractbook called Might is Right, and to the back of ittacked on a series of Elizabethanmagical incantations known in Thelemic and Rosicrucian circles as the EnochianKeys.The Satanic Bible was born. In December of 1969 it went to press as Avonpaperback #NS-44, and inJanuary of V (1970) it was published.Despite the implications of its title, the Satanic Bible was not represented asa revelation authorized orauthenticated by the Prince of Darkness - at least not in a way readers could beexpected to understand. Atface value it was rather a statement by Anton of the principles and practices hechampioned. In his prefaceto the book, he stated bluntly that it had been written to expose and correctthe sanctimonious fraud of theold grimoires and classics of magic as well as to present Satanic philosophyfrom a Satanic perspective,and in the text he proceeded to do both.As was the case with so many other features of the Church of Satan, however, theSatanic Bible wassomehow “more than the sum of its parts”. Its argument was an argument of commonsense, assembled inpart from preexisting concepts, but the excellence of the book lay in itsintegration of these into a code oflife meaningful to the average individual - not just to occultists and/oracademic-level philosophers. In thisAnton LaVey followed in the footsteps of writers such as Thomas Paine, MarshallMcLuhan, and EricHoffer, who understood that the idiom in which ideas are communicated is asimportant as the ideasthemselves.93 Hegarty, Diane in “What the Devil? It’s Divorce, Satan-Style”, Globenewspaper, Boca Raton, Florida, November 1, 1988.- 58 -A philosophy requires precise, sophisticated reasoning on the part of thephilosopher. An ideology, onthe other hand, is merely a simplified statement of goals and means whichrequires only blind belief andemotional enthusiasm on the part of the adherent.Conventional religions, save for the influence of comparatively few philosophersat their conceptuallevels, are ideologies in fancy-dress. Unlike their political counterparts, theydo not bother trying torationalize or justify their pronouncements and prescriptions, since these areproclaimed to be by divineauthority, hence beyond the ken of poor mortals.The Satanic Bible, while exposing this scam, nonetheless drinks at the same wellby clothing itself inthe supernatural authority of the Prince of Darkness and his dæmons. Less thiselement, the Satanic Biblewould be merely a social tract by Anton LaVey - not High Priest of Satan, butjust one more 1960s’-counterculture-cynic atop a soapbox.The substance of the Satanic Bible therefore turns upon Anton LaVey’s sincerityin believing himselfto be the vehicle through which the entity known as Satan explains the mysteriesof mankind’s existentialpredicament. To the extent that he did, the Satanic Bible deserves the dignityof its title.As this history should make abundantly clear, there is no question of AntonLaVey’s convictionconcerning his literal High Priesthood during the 1966-1975 period. And eventhereafter, when he hadlocked himself into the Iron Maiden of mere symbolism, the striking differencein his disposition andmanner of expression serves only to emphasize the point.Despite the haphazard nature of its assembly, therefore, we may thereforeconsider the Satanic Bible inits totality not as argumentative, but as inspired writing. Thus it assumes animportance by its veryexistence, not just by its content. The great books of history have all sharedthis characteristic: that theyexisted, and that this existence in itself catalyzed dramatic reapprehensions ofhuman potential.In 1971 I wrote an introduction (Appendix #10) for the new University Bookshardcover edition of theSatanic Bible, citing several such critical works and comparing this one to“that obscure, maleficmythology The King in Yellow, a psycho-political work that supposedly drove itsreaders to madness anddamnation”. As Robert W. Chambers wrote:It is well known how the book spread like an infectious disease, from city tocity, from continent tocontinent, barred out here, confiscated there, denounced by press and pulpit,censured by even the mostadvanced of literary anarchists. No definite principles had been violated inthose wicked pages, no doctrinepromulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any knownstandard, yet, although it wasacknowledged that the supreme note of art had been struck in The King in Yellow,all felt that human naturecould not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of purestpoison lurked. 94With convulsive drama the Satanic Bible’s Prologue announces the theme of thevolume. Spoken byAnton on the Satanic Mass record to the accompaniment of “Siegfried’s FuneralMusic” from Wagner’sGötterdämmerung, this vengeful passage concludes:“Draweth near in the gloom the twilight of the gods.” The ravens of night haveflown forth to summonLoki, who hath set Valhalla aflame with the searing trident of the Inferno. Thetwilight is done. A glow ofnew light is borne out of the night, and Lucifer is risen, once more toproclaim: “This is the Age of Satan!Satan rules the Earth!”The gods of the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic and undefiledwisdom. The fleshprevaileth, and a great Church shall be builded, consecrated in its name. Nolonger shall man’s salvation bedependent upon his self-denial. And it will be seen that the world of the fleshand the living shall be thegreatest preparation for any and all eternal delights.Rege Satanas! Ave Satanas! Hail, Satan!94 Chambers, Robert W., The King in Yellow. New York: F. Tennyson Neely, 1895,pages #13-14.- 59 -There follow the “Nine Satanic Statements” [see Appendix #1]. Adept George Smithof the Temple ofSet later noted the striking similarity of these Statements, even in theirsequence, to the philosophy of AynRand as expressed in a speech-sequence of the protagonist of her Atlas Shrugged[Appendix #11]. Andindeed the works of Rand were cited on an early Church of Satan reading list.Yet it is the essence of artthat it recognizes and accentuates the most critical features of an impression,and here, as elsewhere in theSatanic Bible, Anton LaVey does just that. His “Nine Statements” are not turgidarguments, but ratherjarring blows from Thor’s hammer, culminating in a subtle, sly afterthought.Thence we come to the mainbodies of the book:The Satanic Bible consists of two comparatively distinct sections of writings:those articulating thesocial philosophy of Satanism (the “Book of Satan” and the “Book of Lucifer”)and those givinginstructions for the practice of Satanic magic (the “Book of Belial” and the“Book of Leviathan”). Thenames of the four “Books” were taken from an old grimoire, The Sacred Magic ofAbra=Melin the Mage(S.L. MacGregor-Mathers, Trans.), in which Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathanare identified as “thefour crown princes of Hell”. 95The “Book of Satan” (Appendix #12) is represented as a diatribe by Anton onbehalf of the Devil. Notuntil XXII/1987 was it discovered that he was not its true author at all. It wasin fact authored by a NewZealander by the name of Arthur Desmond, who wrote it under the pen name of“Ragnar Redbeard” in1896. 96 [Although Anton includes the name of Redbeard in his roster of names towhom the Satanic Bibleis dedicated, he does not explain that dedication, nor credit Redbeard in anyway as the true author of thecontents of the “Book of Satan”. 97 ]The plagiarisms that constitute the “Book of Satan” are to be found throughoutRedbeard’s book Mightis Right, of which S.E. Parker has remarked:Although Redbeard claims to scorn moral codes, stating that “all arbitrary codesof right and wrong areinsolent invasions of personal liberty” and that greatness lies “in being beyondand above all moralmeasurements”, he is nonetheless a moralist. He makes plain his antagonism toJudæo-Christian morality,but his whole approach is shot-through with the perennial moralistic desire toredeem the human race from“evil”. For him what is “natural” is “right”, and the further human beings getaway from “nature”, thefurther they depart from “right”. Leaving aside the fact that “nature” is amental construct, not a fact, andthat “Man” is nothing but an aggregate of individuals, the question remains asto how Redbeard wouldsquare his belief that “every breathing being” is “a differentiated ego” withhis demand that all thesedifferentiated egos accept the common goal of being “natural” - as he definesit. If I am unique, then what itis in my “nature” to be will not be the same as what it is in the “nature” ofother individuals to be. Indeedwhat is “natural” for me may well be “unnatural” for others, and a collisionunavoidable. Redbeard’sinterpretation of “social Darwinism” clearly allows for this, but his moralityof “nature” equally clearlynegates it … Might is Right is a work flawed by major contradictions. Like theChristian Bible it can beused as a source for the most incompatible views; but unlike that venerablecollection of idiocies and myths,it is sustained by a crude vigor that at its most coherent can help to clearaway not a few of the religious,moral, and political superstitions bequeathed to us by our ancestors. 98In Might is Right Redbeard put his finger squarely on the most central andcontroversial issue of allhuman civilizations: What - if any - consideration does man owe to others withwhom he coexists?

The capitalist West -perhaps as a consequenceof the influence of Voltaire and Locke on the American Revolutionary leadership- began its modern erawith uneasy compromises between individualism and social contract.The many unsuccessful individuals tend to resent and envy the few successfulones, and thedemocratic vote has enabled demagogues to play upon this dissatisfaction,promising equality of resultrather than that of opportunity. Frequently the actual consequences of suchcampaigns are aggravating tothe elites (who feel constricted and cheated of the fruits of their abilities)as well as to the masses (whofeel humiliated and useless). The elites lose any sense of socialresponsibility, and the masses lose theirsense of self-reliance; the relationship becomes antagonistic, adversarial, andmutual parasitical.Redbeard’s ringing endorsement of individualism, coming as it did amidst thesocial frictions of theJohnson and Nixon era, was as refreshing to read as Nietzsche’s or Rand’s. Wasit also Satanic? Yes, in thesense that Satan’s great “sin” was ultimately that of individualism: In order tofollow the dictates of hisown will, he broke away from the collective will of God, regardless of its“social beneficence”. Evenwhen confronted with the horrors of Hell, Satan valued his individualism aboveall else. “Better to reign inHell,” he said in Milton’s Paradise Lost, “than serve in Heaven.”Could absolute individualism be practiced by the Church of Satan, eitherinternally or against thefabric of society? Of course not. From the standpoint of the socialestablishment, the Church of Satan wasweak and not particularly beneficial to anything besides itself. Had the law ofthe jungle governed SanFrancisco, the Church could have been squashed like a bug the moment it seemedmore of anembarrassment than an entertainment. But the climate in the city was liberal -those were the euphoricdays of Haight/Ashbury - and, as I have noted, Anton was very careful to temperhis “one part of the mostblatant outrage with nine parts of social respectability”.Satanists could be invited to prey upon the outside world, of course, but Antonregularly remindedthem that the outside world was inclined to be more than a little Satanicitself. A hunter who brashlydisregarded society’s protective guidelines in the quest for success might wellwind up inside of the tiger.Here he emphasized the realism that the absurdly arrogant heroes of Ayn Rand’snovels had disdained toconsider in their Quixotic crusades for self-aggrandizement.Another problem with the law of the jungle was that some Satanists, unable orunwilling to ride thetiger outside of the Church of Satan, elected to try their hand within it,preying upon other Satanists. Thistendency was encouraged by the psychological self-confidence accorded insecureindividuals by the veryfact of their Church membership, to say nothing of any additional honors oroffices held in theorganization.Since the very concept of an organization implies a degree of social contractfor mutual benefit, theHigh Priest soon found himself wrestling with a paradox - a clash betweenideology and reality. In thoseearly days he made his decision in favor of the latter, believing that theChurch of Satan could encourage amaximum of individuality with only a necessary minimum of organizationalrestriction.A very few Satanists would understand and appreciate this license, but a greatmany more would abuseit, and so gradually Anton LaVey would reverse that original decision. It was aprocess that necessarily ledto the corruption of the principles espoused in the Satanic Bible, yet it was atragedy for which Antonwould not bear sole responsibility.As a bizarre postscript: After the Temple of Set discovered and exposed theplagiaristic origins of the“Book of Satan” in the early 1980s, Might is Right was reprinted in its entiretyfirst by Loompanics, thenin a more ominous 1996 edition with a red/white/black/skull & bones,suggestively “neo-Nazi” cover byM.H.P. 99 Anton LaVey was invited to write the latter edition’s Introduction.Incredibly he made no99 Redbeard, Ragnar, Might is Right. Chicago: M.H.P & Co., Ltd., 1996.- 61 -apology whatever for his now-exposed plagiarism, but instead made the absurdclaim that Jack Londonwas “Redbeard”, and that he had personally been shown London’s Might is Rightmanuscripts in a“forbidden” collection at the University of California’s Bancroft Library by acustodian there namedVirginia Harner. The Bancroft Library curtly refuted all of this:Thank you for your interesting letter. The details you enclosed about JackLondon, “Ragnar Redbeard”,and Might is Right appear completely unjustified. The Bancroft Library has nocopy whatsoever of Might isRight either in manuscript or in print. There are no London manuscripts inBancroft which are “withheld/unreleased/forbidden”. Our London collection is modest, fully catalogued, opento research, and as ithappens, much of it is available on the Web at http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu] London/. There is no record of aVirginia Harner as a library employee in any capacity at any time. From thepoint of view of the BancroftLibrary, Mr. LaVey’s claims are totally baseless. I cannot speculate on hismotives for making them.. 100The “Book of Lucifer” encompasses twelve of Anton’s social diatribes, most ofwhich made theirappearance on the “rainbow sheets” after first being expanded from the original“Satanism” monograph(Appendix #1). In the Satanic Bible the essays were reduced to the indignity ofwhite paper, but they lostnone of their fire for that.Impudently the first essay begins with a “wanted - dead or alive!” warrantissued for God, who is thendefined as simply the balancing force in nature, a non-conscious principleincapable of taking an interestin human desires or conduct. Prayer, therefore, is useless. Institutionalforgiveness of “sin” is also useless.It is only as a consequence of one’s own honest appreciation of an injusticedone, and of a consequentresolve to make amends for and not repeat that injustice, that the situation iscorrected.The second essay is “The God You Save May Be Yourself” [see Chapter #3]. Itcarries the premise ofthe first essay to its inevitable conclusion. If “God” is a human invention,then why should man not inventthe most comfortable god he can imagine? In fact his god should be himself,deciding his own values.If the Satanist views himself as his god, I would often be asked, then where didthat leave Satan? Washe to be considered merely a symbol of the self? In the vulgar sense, yes. Itwould be senseless for theSatanist to cast down God just to set up another God in his place, horned ornot. Even in an allegoricalsense it would be the destruction of the Satanic principle as well as thedestruction of God.This was beautifully illustrated in Anatole France’s masterpiece The Revolt ofthe Angels, whereinSatan launches a second assault on Heaven and is victorious. He casts Ialdabaoth(God) into Hell andassumes his throne …And Satan found pleasure in praise and in the exercise of his grace; he loved tohear his wisdom and hispower belauded. He listened with joy to the canticles of the cherubim whocelebrated his good deeds, andhe took no pleasure in listening to Nectaire’s flute, because it celebratednature’s self, yielded to the insectand to the blade of grass their share of power and love, and counseled happinessand freedom.Satan, whose flesh had crept, in days gone by, at the idea that sufferingprevailed in the world, now felthimself inaccessible to pity. He regarded suffering and death as the happyresults of omnipotence andsovereign kindness. And the savour of the blood of victims rose upwards towardshim like sweet incense.He fell to condemning intelligence and to hating curiosity. He himself refusedto learn anything more, forfear that in acquiring fresh knowledge he might let it be seen that he had notknown everything from thevery outset. He took pleasure in mystery, and believing that he would seem lessgreat by being understood,he affected to be unintelligible.Dense fumes of Theology filled his brain. One day, following the example of hispredecessor, heconceived the notion of proclaiming himself one god in three persons. SeeingArcade smile as thisproclamation was made, he drove him from his presence. Istar and Zita had longsince returned to Earth.100 Letter, Anthony S. Bliss, Curator, Rare Books & Literary Manuscripts,Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, to M.A.Aquino, May 1, 1997.- 62 -Thus centuries passed like seconds. Now, one day, from the altitude of histhrone, he plunged his gazeinto the depths of the pit and saw Ialdabaoth in the Gehenna where he himselfhad long lain enchained.Amid the everlasting gloom Ialdabaoth still retained his lofty mien. Blackenedand shattered, terrible andsublime, he glanced upwards at the palace of the King of Heaven with a look ofproud disdain, then turnedaway his head.And the new god, as he looked upon his foe, beheld the light of intelligence andlove pass across hissorrow-stricken countenance.And lo! Ialdabaoth was now contemplating the Earth, and, seeing it sunk inwickedness and suffering,he began to foster thoughts of kindliness in his heart. On a sudden he rose up,and, beating the ether with hismighty arms as though with oars, he hastened thither to instruct and to consolemankind. Already his vastshadow shed upon the unhappy planet a shade soft as a night of love.Fortunately for Satan, this was only a nightmare that he was having. He had notyet actually begun asecond war against God. He awoke, bathed in an icy sweat …Nectaire, Istar, Arcade, and Zita were standing round him. The finches weresinging.“Comrades,” said the great archangel, “no - we will not conquer the heavens.Enough to have thepower. War engenders war, and victory defeat.“God, conquered, will become Satan; Satan, conquering, will become God. May thefates spare me thisterrible lot; I love the Hell which formed my genius. I love the Earth where Ihave done some good, if it bepossible to do any good in this fearful world where beings live but by rapine.“Now, thanks to us, the god of old is dispossessed of his terrestrial empire,and every thinking being onthis globe disdains him or knows him not. But what matter that men should be nolonger submissive toIaldabaoth if the spirit of Ialdabaoth is still in them; if they, like him, arejealous, violent, quarrelsome, andgreedy, and the foes of the arts and of beauty? What matter that they haverejected the ferocious Demiurge,if they do not harken to the friendly dæmons who teach all truths; to Dionysus,Apollo, and the Muses?“As to ourselves, celestial spirits, sublime dæmons, we have destroyedIaldabaoth, our Tyrant, if inourselves we have destroyed Ignorance and Fear.”And Satan, turning to the gardener, said: “Nectaire, you fought with me beforethe birth of the world.We were conquered because we failed to understand that Victory is a Spirit, andthat it is in ourselves and inourselves alone that we must attack and destroy Ialdabaoth.” 101Satan’s point is well-taken. Not only should the Satanist not attempt toenthrone the Devil in God’splace, but he must be wary of it himself. He must free himself from God, butsimultaneously he mustpreserve the innocence of spirit that enabled him to recognize God for thehorror that he was.Satan is a symbol of the self, then, as it should be within the Satanist. Butthis symbolism is only partof the truth, because man’s very ability to think and act in disregard of the“balancing factor” of theUniverse necessitates a source for that ability. And that source is thus theintelligence that made theChurch of Satan far more than an exercise in psychodramatic narcissism. It isthe intelligence of whatmankind has personified as the Prince of Darkness himself - no symbol orallegory, but a sentient being. 102101 France, Anatole, The Revolt of the Angels. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1914, pages#280-282.102 Dr. F.I. Regardie, commenting on this passage in the first edition of thisbook, wrote to me on September 30, 1978: “The Church of Satanis fascinating but does not really define what Satan is. It may use the phrase‘Prince of Darkness’ and a few other descriptive devices, butthese are not quite enough. The groundwork has long been laid for clearerdefinitions. For example, the first half of Volume I of Blavatsky’sSecret Doctrine is a remarkable justification, if you like, for the old Satanicboy. The old lady even started a magazine called Lucifer. One of her favoritephrases in Secret Doctrine is that ‘nature unaided fails’, implying that forevolution to proceed beyond the production of a dumb,moronic robot, the Light-Bearer had to intercede. The light-bearers for her werethe manasaputras, the ‘mind-awakeners’. Anyway you can goon from there. All this is merely by way of preamble or postscript to mystatement that in today’s age it is really quite a simple matter topresent what Satanism is without a lot of hogwash and without all thetheatricalism that usually goes along with this and which usuallyrepresents the inflated ego. I object to theatricalism in this whole area,whether it proceeds from LaVey, Aleister Crowley, Chogyam Trungpa,or St. James Carter. There just ain’t no real need for it.”- 63 -This was the central “secret” - and the heart - of the Church of Satan. With theirony that so oftenaccompanies great truths, it was proclaimed in the institution’s very title; yetin its simplicity it confrontedsuch a massive psychological block in the minds of even some of the mostdedicated Satanists that itremained unnamed and unacknowledged. In the discussions and debates whichregularly surfaced, itwould be referred to obliquely and in hesitant tones. Eventually Anton LaVey andI spoke openly to oneanother about it, but only at times and in places of sacred significance to us.It was the realization thatbrought Anton Szandor LaVey into being as a Magus in the precise sense of thatterm, and it was therealization, perhaps, which prompted him to inscribe my first copy of theSatanic Bible: “To Michael A.Aquino, who shall become more than can now be stated.”With the third essay of the “Book of Lucifer”, Anton punched the “seven deadlysins” full of good-humored holes, pointing out that they all have positive aspects. He thenupbraided would-be magicianswho might wish to have their Satanic cake and eat it too under a “safe” namesuch as “humanism” or“white witchcraft”. If one acts under illusions imposed by others, then one canplead the excuse ofignorance or innocence. But if one is free from such conditions and engages inself-delusion, one issimply a hypocrite. Clearly hypocrites were not welcome in the Church of Satan.In the fourth essay Anton traced the legend of “the Devil” through some of itsmore prominentmanifestations in Eastern and Western cultural tradition, punctuating theaccount with a list of seventy-seven names under which the Archfiend or his close approximations have beenknown. The point to betaken was that “Satan” was to be appreciated as something more significant thana mere Judaic-Christianlegend. The following from one of the “rainbow” handouts, later adapted for thisessay, catches its flavor:Satan, as a god, demi-god, personal savior, or whatever you wish to call him,was invented by theformulators of every religion on the face of the Earth for only one purpose.That purpose is to preside overcarnal, mundane, and so-called wicked activities and situations. Of courseanything indulgent or gratifyingof a physical or mental nature must be “evil”; how else can people be assured offeeling guilty withoutactually going out and hurting others? 103As for “selling one’s soul”, Anton dismissed it as a simple fantasy ofconventional religious paranoia.The fifth essay consists of a short, Aristotelian observation on theinterrelationship of love and hate.Quoting from the earlier “rainbow” handout:You cannot love everyone; it is ridiculous to think you can. If you loveeverything and everybody, youlose the natural power of selection and wind up being a pretty poor judge ofcharacter and quality. Love isonly one of the most powerful forces of the world. Another is hate. If anythingis used too freely, it loses itstrue meaning. Therefore the Satanist believes: Love strongly and completelythose who deserve your love,but do not turn the other cheek to your enemy. Resist every evil; be as a lionin the path - be dangerous evenin defeat. 104The sixth essay is The Great Sex Essay. If, as Aleister Crowley suggested in hisBook of Lies, theUniverse is the practical joke of the general at the expense of the particular,then sex may very well be thepractical joke of the instinct at the expense of the intellect. If other aspectsof Satanism attracted arespectable amount of interest, the sexual philosophy espoused at 6114California Street had SanFrancisco hotter than it had ever been since the Great Fire. Like the statementabout love and hate, Anton’sattitude towards sex was disarmingly simple. It was: If you like it and theother adult [of whatever gender]does too, then enjoy yourself.Perhaps Anton once thought that a policy like this would free the Church ofSatan from having toworry about members’ sexual preoccupations. If so, I imagine he changed his mindabout thirty seconds103 LaVey, Anton, “Satanism” handout, III/1968.104 LaVey, Anton, “We Don’t Love Everybody” handout, III/1968.- 64 -later - because the public, with its usual clarity of perception, translated“tolerance” into “emphasis” and“lack of taboo practices” into “lurid bacchanalia out there in the RichmondDistrict”. [Perhaps Togare wasspirited off to the zoo because the S.P.C.A. feared an attack on his virtue bylibido-maddened Satanistsseeking the ultimate experience?105] Be that as it may, The Devil’s Avengerbears witness to the processionof applicants to the Church of Satan whose interest was intensively, if not onlyone of sex.A lesser man than Anton LaVey might have become disgusted or irritated. ButAnton had his own wayof looking at such things. He was interested in humanity as it actually is, notonly as it might be idealized.And if the same persons who were attracted to the idea of Satanism were alsoextraordinarily interested insex, then he would analyze and understand that connection - not to purge thesexual ingredient, but toidentify and destroy whatever unnecessary, harmful distortions he mightencounter.And in point of fact he became quite successful at this. The Devil’s Avengercites a few of Anton’smore primitive experiments in this area, but these examples are notrepresentative of the sensitivity andsophistication he would regularly and consistently apply to cases. In 1970 hewould write a book ( TheCompleat Witch, or What To Do When Virtue Fails) outlining and illustrating someof his theoriesconcerning female sexuality. Like the Church of Satan itself, this work would bepublicly assessedprimarily on the basis of its supposed “indecencies” to the regrettable eclipseof its actual themes.It would be naïve to suggest that Anton had expected otherwise. Back in hisMagic Circle days he hadfirst formulated what he referred to as the “Law of the Forbidden”, according towhich people will be mostattracted to whatever they are not supposed to see, no matter how intrinsicallyuninteresting it might be.Accordingly the aspects of the Church of Satan most offensive to conventionalmorality would drawdisproportionate attention. He rolled with the punch, wrote the Great Sex Essayfor the Satanic Bible, andproceeded to a topic less entertaining, if not less important.Essay number seven deals with the concept of “psychic vampirism”, a term coinedby Anton todescribe persons who make a practice of imposing themselves on the good will ofothers. The solution?Avoid such types, no matter how honeyed their approach may seem. Before labelingsomeone a psychicvampire, however, one should make a fair estimate of the benefits one isreceiving from him/her. [If youare receiving and are anxious to avoid returning benefits, then you are thepsychic vampire.]The notion of psychic vampirism adds an intriguing wrinkle to Satanism’s generalphilosophy ofindividualism and “rational selfishness”. The Satanist is invited to prey uponothers for personalbetterment, but he is advised to be chivalrous in the process. He may competeruthlessly with peers, but hemay not enrich himself by assaulting old ladies and robbing them of theirpurses. If he is a criminal, then"},{"pageContent":"he is as “evil” a criminal as Zorro or Robin Hood; he has opted for an æsthetic,not a legal code of ethics.Where does one draw the line? Who can foresee the possible consequences of anunethical or illegalact in modern society? George Washington committed high treason against hiscountry … and a short timelater found himself immortalized as “father” of a new one. Adolf Hitlerattempted to save his country fromwhat he thought was its almost certain destruction and succeeded twelve yearslater in ensuring thatdestruction. Will you be so bold as to emulate Robin Hood and be your own judgeof right and wrong? Ifyou are lucky, you may become a folk hero. If not, as Al Capone discovered,you’ll just go to jail. [Youcan still be a folk hero in jail, but it’s just not the same.]By now it should be apparent that Anton LaVey was handing the reader of theSatanic Bible somerather formidable blank checks. In effect he was saying: If you want to be agod, go ahead and try - butdon’t think it’s going to be easy. The illusion is easy; the actuality is not.Anyone can play at being aSatanist, but to really be one is difficult and dangerous.On that little red card that I saw in the Marina Theater back in 1968, Anton hadchosen to summarizethe philosophy of the Church of Satan as “Indulgence Instead of Abstinence”.This concept was thesubject of the next essay in the “Book of Lucifer”. From the original “rainbowsheet”:105 According to a neighbor of Anton LaVey interviewed in Satanis, Togare bitthe man from the SPCA en route to the San Francisco Zoo.- 65 -The Eastern mystical beliefs, which have been in great intellectual favor inrecent years, have taughtpeople to contemplate their navels, stand on their heads, avoid the use oflabels in life, and disciplinethemselves against any conscious will for success so they might dissolvethemselves into “UniversalCosmic Awareness” - anything to avoid good, healthy self-satisfaction or honestpride in earthlyaccomplishments. I am sure you have seen just as many so-called disciplinedyogis with the inability tocontrol a smoking habit as anyone else, or who become just as excited as a “lessaware” person when anattractive member of the opposite sex [or in some cases the same sex] walks by.Yet when asked to explaintheir faith, these people retreat into the ambiguity which characterizes theirfaith - being that no one can pinthem down if there are no straight answers that can be given.As a Satanist you will be encouraged to indulge in the so-called seven deadlysins. They all lead tophysical or mental gratification and were only invented by the Christian churchto ensure guilt on the part ofits followers, because it would be impossible for anyone to avoid committingthese “sins”. As a sop to theparishioners’ conscience, offerings are made to their god through theirchurch.106Not surprisingly Anton drew a careful distinction between “indulgence” and“compulsion”. When onecannot release or express one’s desires through socially-acceptable channels, hesaid, compulsions orobsessions will result; their release may then take a distorted, destructive, orunbalanced form. Moreover,because of the subconscious guilt felt by the individual at harboring andexpressing taboo emotions, thepleasure of the release will be significantly masochistic.The unorthodox sexual preferences of some Satanists may serve as a case inpoint. A transvestitemight be attracted to a Satanic Grotto as the result of its tolerance of suchthings, but time and again thetransvestite would become frustrated if his habit were accepted as somethingnormal and unremarkable.Part of the thrill, it would seem, is the masochistic shame involved, even ifthe person protests loudly tothe contrary to conceal that masochism.It was something of a Satanic Catch-22: The Church of Satan would deny thestigma of perversion,thereby seeming a haven for “perverse” persons. These same persons, however,would quickly becomefrustrated unless their preferences were catered to, either ritually orsocially, as perversions.A somewhat similar paradox was encountered by Anton LaVey himself as SatanicHigh Priest. Heknew what the title meant to himself, but he soon discovered that it meant manyother things to manyother people, and that they would become disillusioned, resentful, and evendangerous if he failed to liveup to their expectations or play to their fantasies. Like Satan himself, Antonbecame teacher, master,father, friend, fiend, slave-driver, philosopher, clown, prophet, aristocrat,and god. His carnival studies hadtaught him to read his idealized image in others’ eyes and to play to that image[or against it if he wereminded to shock his audience]. 107In 1928 a man named Abraham Merritt wrote a novel entitled Seven Footprints toSatan, not about theDevil but about a freakish human mastermind who modeled his personality andpleasures after those ofthe Archfiend. He commanded a global following of influential and powerfulpersonalities, bound to himnot only by fear but by admiration and respect.But there was another dimension to “Satan’s” character. In an undergrounddungeon he wouldsummon before him a ghastly assortment of the ruined, the helpless, and thehopeless of humanity -pathetic creatures for whom life had lost whatever meaning it once might havehad. To each of these poor,damned souls “Satan” would offer a drink of a drug called Kheft in return for anappeal to him as God.And for a brief moment after tasting the Kheft, the suppliant would forget hisagony and obtain a glimpseof some fleeting memory dear to him. If anything were required to make such ascene even more hellish, itwas the wanton, disdainful cynicism with which “Satan” received each obeisanceand dispensed eachchalice of the Kheft.106 LaVey, Anton, “We Don’t Love Everybody” handout, III/1968.107 See letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 14, IV/1969 (Chapter 4).- 66 -It was Anton LaVey’s fate to administer a type of Kheft to those who demanded itof him, and only heis in a position to know the emotions that gripped him as he answered eachappeal. Pity? Contempt? Orsome terrible combination of the two that, in Merritt’s words, would “dissolvehis very soul” as itwitnessed the simultaneous salvation and destruction of the souls of others inhis Den of Iniquity?Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch’entrate.Satanists of the Dennis Wheatley type are presumed to have a penchant for humansacrifice, so in hisninth essay Anton addressed the notion of sacrifice in general and of humansacrifice in particular. At itsmost elemental level, “sacrifice” implies the giving-up of something precious tooneself in return for someother benefit or favor. Humans being the selfish creatures they are, it hasalways seemed preferable to giveup something precious to others in order to obtain the expected benefit. In itsmost savage form this hasentailed religious mutilation or murder, but civilization has succeeded inrefining it to the scale of moderninternational wars with little trouble.And so Anton’s first prescription was simply that one should not destroy ananimal or an innocenthuman being to avenge or appease self-generated insecurities. If a sacrifice isfelt to be necessary for amagical ritual, then the sacrifice should be a true one - involving the magicianhimself.Lest it be thought that he was advocating suicide, Anton hastened to point outthat a true Satanist,harboring no subconscious hatreds towards himself, would have no reason to seekself-destruction. Hewould experience joy and fulfillment through life, not death.What of the destruction of others per the law of the jungle? After all, the“Book of Satan” seemed tosay that vengeance was not only acceptable but admirable. Here Anton chose hiswords carefully. A truegod will not draw the line at murder, because his divinity enables him to decideissues of life and deathwith absolute justice. But the Satanic Bible was written not for gods but forimperfect human beings who,if licensed to murder, would do so for equally imperfect reasons. [Humans,sensing this imperfection, haveaddressed it by legitimizing murder only at the national level. Logically theimperfection remainsuncorrected by such a solution, inasmuch as a great many imperfect judgments donot combine to form aperfect one even if a consensus of opinion is reached.]For the fledgling Satanist, then, Anton recommended a ritual exercise in thepassing of divinejudgment by the symbolic destruction of individuals determined to deserve it.The idea was that themagician, forced to confront a mock reality of his wishes, would thereby becomeincreasingly moreobjective in making them and would approach, if not necessarily attain a trulydivine perspective inadjudging the conduct of others.It was a tactic that succeeded. Again and again Satanists who began theirmagical careers reciting longlists of curse victims gradually decided that they were being rather excessivein their condemnations.Finally they would become extremely discriminating in wishing any harm at all onothers, realizing thatclashes between human beings occur for many reasons besides unwarranted personalhatred. The mostadvanced Satanists, Anton LaVey included, pronounce almost no curses at all. Thetrue Satanist, inNietzsche’s words, has passed “beyond good and evil” to a level of existencewhere all interactions ofnature are seen in perspective. This is the law of the jungle in its highersense, as perhaps Kipling meant toexpress it when he wrote his Jungle Books.Satanism glorifies life and rejects forms of abstinence based upon presumedreward or punishment in aposthumous Heaven or Hell. Does this mean that the Satanist must become resignedto a termination ofhis conscious existence when his body wears out, his heart stops beating, andhis brain cells decompose?Anton’s tenth essay dealt with this unpleasant proposition.Life and happiness in life are not favors dispensed by a God or Devil. Life is abiological incident ofnon-conscious natural law, and happiness in life is the product of anindividual’s own desires and his skillat realizing them. Consequently, suggested Anton, people should enjoy life asmuch as they possibly can.Such a statement would seem rather ridiculous were it not for the fact that agreat many people workvery hard at not enjoying life. In ancient and medieval times, to be sure, thecommon man confronted anexistence fraught with uncertainty, peril, and poverty. With the vision of amind that was not wholly that of- 67 -a natural beast, he resented his physical prison. He took such modest pleasuresas he could, and, desiringmore, he created great fantasy worlds for himself where he could not beoppressed by feudal lords,ravaged by the elements, or wasted by hideous diseases.But even this escape was to be denied him, since others, sensing the power ofsuch visions, determinedto control them. They began to dictate the visions and to impose punishments forunauthorized ones, andso man created religion. That delicate, beautiful quality in the human mind thathad enabled it to reach outto the stars was crushed on the rack of the Inquisition and replaced by the“dense fumes of theology”.As turgid as they were, the life-after-death religions made the misery of lifeat least a little lessmiserable by holding out the hope of salvation and redemption in the afterworld.It might be a falsepromise, but it was comforting - and it could not be exposed as a lie until toolate.As civilization continued its upward climb, the life of the common man graduallybecame longer,healthier, and more affluent. It stands to reason that it should have becomehappier, but this would haveweakened the hold of the great religions. So they told man that he should feelguilty for enjoying himself,because such enjoyment was supposed to occur only after death. By another ofthose almost incredibleironies of history, this idiotic proposition was believed across almost theentire range of moderncivilization. There were those who denied it, and there were those who exploitedit, but on the whole itprevailed. Only in the most recent times, when it has become so difficult toavoid having fun that mostpeople have given up the battle [and the guilt], have the life-after-deathreligions begun to lose their gripand their power.Anton LaVey did not start this revolution, nor did he lead it in a demagogicsense, but he did articulateit far more succinctly and essentially than anyone else had managed to do. Inmagical terminology heUttered a Word - Indulgence - which shattered all philosophies and theologiesnot incorporating thisprinciple, and thereby he became a Magus. [The magical title of “Magus”identifies those magicians ofhistory who have conceptualized and defined successive stages of mankind’snon-natural evolution.]But, Anton continued, there was more to “life” than mere terrestrial existence.As the mind increasedin power and self-awareness, it became less a prisoner in its physical shell andnature-governed mode ofexistence. Could it be that this process might continue to a stage at which theego could break freealtogether and become entirely self-contained? Maurice Maeterlinck had raisedjust this hypothesis in oneof his essays [see Chapter #25], and the entire thrust of Satanism seemed tolead in this direction.Unable to make a conclusive prediction concerning the outcome of thisexperiment, Anton contentedhimself in the essay with restating the hypothesis. Yet it was not a passinginterest on his part. In the yearsto follow he conducted many strange and exotic experiments to test the theory.In some I participated.The eleventh essay of the “Book of Lucifer” merely serves to identify theprincipal holidays on theSatanic calendar - one’s own birthday [as one’s own god!], Walpurgisnacht,Halloween, and theapproximate dates of the annual Equinoxes and Solstices.In the twelfth and final essay, Anton exposed the traditional stereotype of theBlack Mass as anexercise in anti-Satanic propaganda. Were actual Satanists to perform such aceremony, he said, it wouldbe for psychodramatic, illustrative purposes and not because of any intrinsicmagic in the satire.He concluded the essay with a brief account of some of the more abortiveattempts at Satanism whichhad taken place since the seventeenth century: the Chambre Ardente scandal ofVersailles, Sir FrancisDashwood’s Hellfire Club, and the quasi-Rosicrucian offshoots ofturn-of-the-century Europe such asBritain’s Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.), Germany’s Ordo TempliOrientis (O.T.O.), andAleister Crowley’s Order of the Silver Star (A.'.A.'.). Crowley’s significanceas a magician was rathercondescendingly dismissed, probably because Anton’s chief exposure to him at thetime had been throughJohn Symonds’ unflattering biography The Great Beast.Following the “Book of Lucifer” is the “Book of Belial”, in which Anton outlinesthe theory andpractice of magic as employed by the Church of Satan. In his classic Magick inTheory and Practice,Aleister Crowley defined magic as “the science and art of causing change tooccur in conformity withwill”. Anton narrows this definition slightly by excluding the use of “normallyaccepted methods”. For- 68 -him, magic is a court of last resort to be used when more direct means fail,whereas for Crowley theconcept embraced his entire philosophy of existence.A successful magical working, says the Satanic Bible, incorporates five basicingredients: a seriousdesire for results, timing of the ritual to coincide with the magician’sgreatest strength of will [and therecipient’s least resistance], effective use of imagery to focus attention,direction of the working into aconcentrated sending, and maximum utilization of the balance factor [notexpecting magic to compensatefor too great a difference between the status quo and the desired objective, itbeing most effective whenemployed, as it were, to “tip the balance”].Next are outlined the sequential steps for a “basic” ritual, adapted from theearlier instructionsprovided to new members of the Church [see Chapter #4]. After preparing thechamber and robing himselfappropriately, the magician purifies the air by ringing a bell nine times[which, through the process ofsuggestion, lessens subsequent distraction by outside noise]. He intones theintroductory invocations toSatan and the specific Powers of Darkness he wishes to invoke, then establishesa magical/physical linkwith them by the act of drinking from a ceremonial chalice [which may containany pleasing, exoticessence; I favor fresh blackberry juice]. The four Abra=Melin princes areinvoked at the four cardinalpoints of the compass: Satan at the south, Lucifer at the east, Belial at thenorth, and Leviathan at the west.At this point in the ceremony, if there is a congregation present, an artificialphallus is used by thecelebrant to perform a benediction. For serious rituals of operative magic, afairly unremarkable,sculptured device might be used. In rituals of an illustrative nature, however -particularly those withsatirical or humorous intent - it was another matter. A dildo of the mostoutrageous size and shape wouldappear; I recall an enormous, gold-leafed penis which would steal the show atCalifornia Street, as well asa day-glo rubber monstrosity at one midwest Grotto which would invariably reduceits audience tohelpless laughter when produced and waggled piously. Io Pan!Next the actual object of the ritual would be pursued, whether curse, blessing,psychodrama, orcommunion. When brought to a close, this part of the proceeding would bepunctuated by the word“Shemhamforash!” and then “Hail, Satan!”.[The] Shem ha’Meforash is the so-called “Name of 72” (the number of syllables inthe name) of theJudaic/Christian god, used in non-ceremonial Jewish conversations wherein “YHVH”or “Adonai” wouldbe considered blasphemous. Like many obscure features of Judaica, it became anobject of confused andsuspicious speculation with the advent of Christianity. By the 1500s it wasconsidered a device of BlackMagic, which Martin Luther accused the Roman Catholic of using to deceive thefaithful. A century laterit appeared as the title of a magical text claiming to contain Jewish Cabalists’spells to invoke spirits andattack their enemies. And that text later resurfaced as part of the Sixth andSeventh Books of Moses, whosemere possession was alleged to doom one to Hell. It was in this book that AntonLaVey came across it anddecided to appropriate it as a “word of power” for his eventual Satanicritualism.“Hail, Satan!” would be accompanied by all rising to give the Sign of the Horns[made by theclenching of the upraised fist with index and little fingers extended].The ceremony would normally conclude with the pronunciation of one of thenineteen Enochian Keyscomprising the latter half of the Satanic Bible, followed by a second ringing ofthe bell and the words “Soit is done!”. And the Enochian Keys have a story of their own:On April 13, 1584 John Dee, mathematician and magician to the court of QueenElizabeth I, undertooka series of magical workings in Cracow, Poland. With the assistance of EdwardKelley, he wrote into hisdiaries nineteen incantations in what he called the “Enochian” or “Angelic”language. With eachincantation or “Key” Dee provided an English translation, also communicated bythe angel Nalvage toKelley. In 1659 a slightly inaccurate version of the Dee diaries containing theKeys was published by- 69 -Meric. Casaubon as A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yearsbetween Dr. John Deeand Some Spirits.108In the late nineteenth century the Casaubon Keys were adopted into theceremonial inventory of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.), a London-based successor to theolder SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia (S.R.I.A.). The Golden Dawn’s flamboyant leader, SamuelL. MacGregor-Mathers,modified the spelling and construction of the Keys to make them morepronounceable. And, while he wasat it, he wove round them a complex interpretation bound up in the “HebrewCabala” and the OsirianEgyptian lore beloved of the G.'.D.'..109A few years later, following the disintegration of the G.'.D.'. as an effectiveorganization, AleisterCrowley published Mathers’ version of the Keys in his magical periodical, TheEquinox (Issue #I-8). In1900 and again in 1909 Crowley used the Nineteenth Key to obtain a famous seriesof experiences knownas The Vision and The Voice [also first published in Equinox #I-5], consideredby many to be one of themost beautiful and powerful of his writings.Since it contains many references both to the magical degree/grade system of theG.'.D.'. and A.'.A.'.and to Crowley’s personal progress through that system, The Vision and The Voicecannot be fullyunderstood or appreciated unless one has first made quite an extensive study ofCrowley’s life andphilosophy. [The single most helpful presentation of the text is The Vision andThe Voice by AleisterCrowley (F.I. Regardie, Ed.), Dallas: Sangreal Foundation, 1972. It containsboth Crowley’s own notes onthe sequence and Regardie’s comments on certain more obscure points.]110As beautiful as the Keys were, they never attracted much attention or interestoutside of traditionaloccult circles until Anton Szandor LaVey chose to add them to the Satanic Bible.Taking the modifiedKeys from the Equinox, he further altered them by replacing their Heavenlyreferences with diabolicalones, producing a set of Keys that was virtually a “Black Mass” variation of theG.'.D.'. version.Predictably the LaVey Keys, bastardized though they might be, radiated anatmosphere of sheer powercompletely unapproached by the older texts. And somehow the translationsincorporating Satanicterminology also seemed more appropriate.There was, as one might expect, a row in traditional occult circles. For theaforementioned Sangrealbook Regardie wrote an introduction lashing out at the Satanic Bible as a“debased volume” presenting a“perverted edition” of the Keys. He went on to attack Anton’s substitution ofnames and “several otherpieces of similar stupidity”. 111On May 3, 1974 I brought the Regardie introduction to Anton’s attention duringan evening at the BelAir mansion of actress Elke Sommer; he was disappointed [because he and Dianehad counted Regardie afriend] but not entirely surprised. 112 The Church of Satan’s response was anarticle (“Caucus Race”) by mein its Cloven Hoof newsletter pointing out the historical inauthenticity of the“Hebrew Cabala” and the108 Deacon, Richard, John Dee.

Acopy was sent to Regardie,who presumably found it as palatable as Anton had found his introduction. 113Two features of the Satanic Bible remain to be discussed: its dedication pageand closing inscription.Until the 1980s the hardcover and all paperback printings of the Satanic Bibleincluded an openingpage containing an extensive list of dedications. Heading these was the overallbook dedication: “ForDiane”. After Diane left Anton and moved out of 6114, however, he apparentlyinstructed Avon Books todelete this dedication from all future printings. Evidently the publisherinterpreted these instructions toinclude all dedications, because not only Diane’s name but the entire listfollowing it vanished.This is regrettable, because that list was one of the most interesting thingsabout the Satanic Bible,containing many clues to its contents and to the orientation of its author. Inthe chapter on Anton LaVeyand the Church of Satan in his 1997 book Lords of the Left-Hand Path, Stephen E.Flowers provided aconcise summary of them, reproduced here as Appendix #13.At the very end of the Satanic Bible were the enigmatic words “YANKEE ROSE”.Anton purposelyleft them unexplained, and the wildest theories came to be advanced regardingthem by curious Satanistsaround the country. I am afraid that, during my 1971-5 Editorship of the ClovenHoof, I maliciously addedto the confusion by attributing garbled versions of the words to eldritchEgyptian sphinxes or finding their“innermost secret” in an ancient rock-temple on the Micronesian island ofPonape.At one point, when the topic came up during a conversation of ours, Antonsomberly told me that theYankee Rose was an American clipper ship that disappeared under mysteriouscircumstances andreappeared a number of times just as freakishly, after the fashion of The FlyingDutchman or the U.S.S.Eldridge. 114 Hence the name at the “stern” of the Satanic Bible implied yetanother “surfacing” of thePowers of Darkness. While this is a deliciously-exotic story, I have neverencountered any nauticalhistories to substantiate it, so [regretfully] conclude I was merely having myleg pulled!Recently Zeena Schreck cleared up this famous mystery. When playing the organ atthe “LostWeekend” nightclub, Anton liked to finish with an obscure popular tune from the1920s - “YankeeRose”.115 There is nothing at all “Satanic” about the words116 or music to thissong, so presumably itsplacement at the end of Anton’s first book was in the nature of a private joke:his “signature sign off”, as itwere, to this extraordinary Avon paperback “in which the essence of purestpoison lurked”.113 In a letter to me dated September 30, 1978, Dr. Regardie remarked: “Myreference to the Satanic Bible as a debased volume waspredicated on my opinion that LaVey here was dishonest. There are specific wordsin the Enochian language for ‘God’, etc. To translate themas ‘Satan’, ‘the Devil’, etc. I say now as then is dishonest. It would have beenbetter to have appended a footnote or whatever to say that thename ‘God’ had been deliberately replaced by ‘Satan’, etc. That was the essenceof my criticism and still is. Honesty among modern Westernoccultists does seem to be quite a hidden quality.”114 The U.S. Navy destroyer Eldridge was the famous disappearing ship of thefabled “Philadelphia Experiment”, a 1943 attempt by the U.S.Navy to employ massive electromagnetic fields to deflect and distort radar andsonar waves in order to make a ship undetectable. Theexperiment failed because of unforeseen physical damage to the crew within thefields, after which the Navy denied it had ever occurred. Oneof the wilder rumors thereafter was that the ship vanished entirely from thePhiladelphia Navy Yard and reappeared moments later at Norfolk,Virginia - then bounced back to Philadelphia!115 “Yankee Rose” by Sidney Holden & Abe Frankl (Irving Berlin Music, 1926).116 (1) We’ve seen roses grow almost ev’rywhere / But you’re one we place apart,/ For there is none we’ve found who is half as fair, / As ourown sweet heart: / YANKEE ROSE so true, / How we all love you, / And we’re proudto say / You belong to the U.S.A. / YANKEE ROSE wecall / Sweetest rose of all, / And thru’ strife and care, you’re always there, /That’s why we’ll always love you YANKEE ROSE. YANKEEROSE. (2) Where the Hudson flows, there’s a diff’rent rose, / And they call her“Liberty”, / Let me say to you she’s Red, White, and Blue, /You’ll agree with me: / YANKEE ROSE so true, / Million beaus love you, / To theworld you say / Welcome to the U.S.A. / They saluteYANKEE ROSE, / She’s a beaut’ in that pose, / Here’s my hand, my heart, I’llplay my part, / And so will ev’ry Yankee, YANKEE ROSE.YANKEE ROSE.[index-71_1.jpg]- 71 -The Cloven Hoof, the Church of Satan’s newsletter, had a modest beginning in1969 as From theDevil’s Notebook - a periodic bulletin of news briefs and letters mimeographedon the familiar “rainbow”paper. A quote from one of the letters included in a 1969 issue is both amusingand illustrative of thedistance between Anton and a membership to whom Satanism was something yetunintelligible:Since getting the Eye of Horus (a hand-crafted health amulet sold by theChurch), I have not beenafflicted by a single disease, not even so much as a cold; and, what is more, Ihave been able, by pressingthe amulet upon the afflicted member, to cure myself of headaches, toothaches,backaches, bellyaches, andthe pain in the joints I get from cracking my fingers and toes; and only themost callous of abuse andneglect has been sufficient to break out my face. 117“Good work,” replied California Street a bit lamely. “You’re learning fast.”By the following year the now-renamed Cloven Hoof had sobered up considerably.Anton LaVeydeigned to reveal the Universal Truths he had received from the Great High Llama[not “Lama”] in themysterious Katmandu Monastery, among them:- A bird in the hand is useless when you want to blow your nose.- Don’t ever sit on a stone bench with a glass bottle in your back pocket.- If you are a lady, do not wear patent leather shoes because men will see yourunderpants reflected in them.- A crowded elevator smells different to a midget.- Never shove your mother while she’s shaving.118An attempt was also made by “a group of the Church’s wizards” to create acalendar of Satanic themesand events. The four Abra=Melin Princes - Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan- were accorded summer,spring, autumn, and winter respectively.The magical year was begun in December with the Winter Solstice on the 22nd. Themonth wasdedicated to Set as Lord of the Wasteland, and an invocation was made to the“unconquered Sun” at itsmoment of rebirth. [There is an amusing error, as in ancient Egypt Set governedthe six months from theSummer (North) Solstice.]119Further dedications were: January - Loki, Destroyer of Valhalla; February -Thoth, Lord of Wisdom;March - Ishtar, Goddess of the Flesh; April - Pan; May - Cybele, the GreatMother; June - Melek Taus, the117 Letter, Big Dave Weinstein in From the Devil’s Notebook, IV/1969.118 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, February V/1970, page #2.119 Carus, Paul, The History of the Devil. New York: Land’s End Press, 1969,page #17.- 72 -Peacock King; July - Sekhmet; August - Hecate, Goddess of Witchcraft; September- Mars the Avenger;October - Anubis; November - Pluto, Lord of the Underworld. 120In the March Hoof Anton decreed that distinctive medallions would henceforthdesignate the variousmembership degrees of the Church. Novice members (I°) would wear the Sigil ofBaphomet in blackagainst red. The Baphomet in black against white denoted Witches and WarlocksII°, while Wizards (thePriesthood of Satan III°) wore white-on-black Baphomets. Sorcerers (Masters IV°)were entitled to ablack medallion with white inverted pentagram, and a Magus V° (LaVey himself)would be distinguishedby a red lightning bolt through the IV° pentagram. 121In an editorial entitled “The Shame of the New Witch Cult”, Anton lashed out atthe cowardice andhypocrisy of neo-occultists who affected the trappings of the Black Arts withoutacknowledging the truetradition and force behind them:They play at the games which caused our forebears to be slaughtered and torturedas agents of Satan.And what do they do, now that it is safe to use His Great Infernal Name? Theydeny him! They have thevery opportunity to cast the very creed of defamation, which killed theirbrothers and sisters of the past -cast that creed before the world in triumphant mockery of its age of unreason!But no! They do not thrustthe bifid barb of Satan aloft and shout: “He has triumphed!” His Art and Workswhich brought men to therack and thumbscrew can now be learned in safety. But no! He is denied! Deniedby those who cry up HisArt and ply His Work!Satan’s Name will not be denied! Let no man shun or mock His Name who plays Hiswinning game -or Despair, Depletion, and Destruction await!122Aspiring members were invited to take an examination to become Witches (female)or Warlocks(male) II°. The examination consisted of a series of essay questions concerningthe Satanic Bible’scontents and the requirement that the aspirant submit the draft of a lust,compassion, or curse ritual. Firedby Anton’s call to arms, I composed the curse included here as Appendix #14.Back in the United StatesJanet took her examination as well. In February we were confirmed as a Warlockand a Witch of theBrotherhood of the Cauldron II°.The publication of the Satanic Bible had spread the doctrines of Satanism farbeyond San Francisco.Letters began to pour into the Central Grotto, among them the following [from afuture Master of theTemple]:My dear Anton LaVey, Reflection of my Redeemer:My name is Robert J. DeCecco. I have long been a follower of the Left-Hand Path.I have seen, and doas you do the false moral enigma to which man, through lies and propaganda, hasadhered for manycenturies.I have been searching for many years for a way in which I can help my fellow manwho believes as I doto see his misconceptions and do something to correct them by any means humanlypossible. I have recentlystumbled upon your Satanic Bible. Never in all my life have I been soenlightened by a man, or any person,as you have enlightened me. Your book is the answer to what I have beensearching for all these years. Ihave never thought of Satan as evil, only as the one to whom my body and mindmust answer. And if I mustanswer, I will answer to the pleasures which only Satan can offer. “Indulgenceinstead of abstinence.”I have studied your book from cover to cover many times over. Each time I seemto receive a newrevelation. The “Book of Satan” and the “Book of Lucifer” are filled with truthand wisdom. The “Book ofBelial” and the “Book of Leviathan” are filled with answers and means by which Ior any other seeingperson can achieve total happiness and “power through joy”.120 Cloven Hoof, February V/1970, pages #5-7.121 Cloven Hoof, March V/1970, page #1.122 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, March V/1970, page #2.- 73 -The main purpose of this letter is to ask for your blessings in continuing yourgood work in allowingman to adhere to his earthly desires. I would like - no, I beg for yourpermission to conduct classes in myhome for as many people as I can, to carry on your work. I am sure of myself andof your doctrines. I swearto consider you as my Pope and redeemer and carry this to those who will listen.I would also like toperform organized ritual in a manner respectful to you. Please hear me andrecognize me, for I am truly aSatanist!123In December of 1969, after my exchange of correspondence with John Ferro, Iwrote my father-in-law,who had expressed concern over this peculiar interest of ours:Anton LaVey is an unusual type of person, no doubt about that. The stuff in theSatanic Bible soundshard-core and not a little brutal, but the man himself is quite congenial. As atheologian he is moreinteresting to talk to than most, since he has to be a pretty swift thinker todefend and advocate somethingas touchy as Satanism. He reminds me a good deal of Bishop Pike, whom I knewboth in San Francisco andin Santa Barbara.I don’t think that even LaVey is fully aware of the implications of thephilosophy he has spearheaded.Eric Hoffer in “The Unnaturalness of Human Nature” suggested that man’s egoseparates him from the restof the natural Earth. In his frustration he perceives ego as a “weakness”, whichhe then must demonstratesuperior to nature if he wishes to prove to himself his innate worth. Thisego/mind struggle against naturalconditions, in my opinion, is merely a more academic way of expressing the Satanvs. God thing.LaVey’s ideas transcend the old “good vs. bad” issue by which most peopledelineate the Satan/Godrelationship. Goodness and badness, I think, are qualities independent ofreligion [or at least what I considerreligion]. The point at the bottom of the whole thing is that Satanism is not somuch a rival religion as ananti-religion. Which sounds pretty esoteric, I’ll admit, but I believe there’s amerit to it.In any case there are a number of things which I don’t like about the SatanicBible too. But itestablishes a base upon which to build; and it yanks the reader by his nose,hard, which is something mosttheological works don’t do. In response to having my nose yanked, I am nowworking on a Satanic-doctrinebook of my own, which I’ll probably have ready in a few months. Maybe it willyank noses on its ownmerit. 124When leaving for South Vietnam in June 1969 I had taken with me a copy of JohnMilton’s epicParadise Lost, which I considered then, as now, one of the most exaltedstatements of Satanism everwritten. Satan is its true hero; its Christian moralisms are so pale and wateryin comparison that I amsurprised it and its author were not summarily burned upon its appearance inCromwellian England. Thatit not only survived Puritan censorship but was actually lauded as a complimentto Christianity is yetanother of those titanic ironies which have accompanied the Prince of Darknesson his tortuous journeyacross the eras of human civilization.As much as I admired Paradise Lost, I was annoyed at its ever-present, if proforma bias. The die wasloaded against Satan; he might put up a good fight, but in the end he was doomedto defeat. It was not somuch that I wanted to see him triumph. Rather I felt that his power and positionwere equal to God’s if notmore potent, and I wanted to see a contest that would more accurately representthe struggle between thePowers of Darkness and those of Light.In early 1970 I took pen in hand and, during the moments when I was not occupiedwith militaryresponsibilities [at the time I was based in the village of Lai Khe, directingPSYOP teams for the 1stInfantry Division], I began to write a restatement of certain themes fromParadise Lost. It was hardly an“ivory tower” meditation. I wrote in old, bombed-out buildings dating from theFrench occupation, inhelicopters, in tents, and in the midst of underbrush in the “Iron Triangle” and“Trapezoid” (!) fire zones.Part of the text of the “Statement of Beelzebub” had to be reconstructed fromnotes at one point when an123 DeCecco, Robert J. (Amn) in Cloven Hoof, April V/1970, pages #9-10.124 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Frederick F. Forbes, December 23, IV/1969.- 74 -incoming rocket blew a packet of papers [and the storage room holding them] toatoms. Often, as I hadremarked to Ferro, I would be interrupted from my musings by the suddennecessity to dive for asandbagged bomb shelter.Slowly but inevitably, however, the manuscript crept towards completion. I say“inevitably” because Ibegan to develop a most peculiar feeling about it. As I wrote the sequentialpassages, I seemed to sense,rather than determine what they should say. And if I penned words or phrasesthat “didn’t fit”, I wouldexperience continual irritation and impatience until I had replaced them withthe “correct” combination. Itwas as though the text had a life of its own; and even when it was done, I foundmyself unable to type it asI had originally intended to do. Instead I took another month to copy it into afinished book of twovolumes in an odd calligraphic script of mine that, once more, “imposed itself”on the project. By aboutthe middle of March it was done, and I sent it off to Anton LaVey in SanFrancisco. Its title was TheDiabolicon, and a transcript is enclosed as Appendix #15. Anton’s response wasnot long in coming:I received The Diabolicon safely. It is indeed a work which will have a lastingimpact. It is done in anageless manner and with complete awareness. So impressed am I that I haveselected passages from it formy own personal reading in this evening’s ceremony, which pays homage to thewritings of the SatanicMasters of the past, such as Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Twain, Hobbes, etc., whowill be portrayed bymembers of my Council reading their respective works. This will be the firstexposure to your work, outsideof my wife and Reverend Ferro, and I am certain the reaction will be as I expectit to be.You have my sincere gratitude for the fine gift you have so graciously bestowedupon us, and you maybe assured that it will assume a meaningful place in the Order.When you return to San Francisco in June, I look forward to spending as muchtime as possible withyou, as there is much I have to impart concerning your future role in the Churchof Satan. 125Two days later a letter arrived from John Ferro:The High Priest has graciously decided to comply with your expressed desire andwill ordain you to theSatanic Priesthood this next June. However, it is his wish that you be elevatedto that office in a privateritual prior to your presentation to the members of the Council of the Order ofthe Trapezoid. The reasonsfor this decision will be made known to you in due time. We do wish you tocomplete the usual test foraspirants to the Priesthood, but merely as a formality. The nature, execution,and mode of delivery of yourmanuscript so exemplified every quality to be desired in a Priest of Satan thatit has been decreed that therebe no further delay in your ordination save that necessitated by the time thatmust elapse before you maypresent yourself to the High Priest. This too fits well into the magical plansand workings of the High Priest,and it will afford you an opportunity to prepare yourself for the event and toexperience that intensity whichonly elated anticipation can produce. The ceremony will be as awesome as anypublic ordination, indeedmore so by the nature of its exclusiveness and secrecy.126Back in San Francisco the film Satanis: The Devil’s Mass127 had just beenreleased. Newsweekmagazine had something to say about it in its April 13th issue:125 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 27, V/1970.126 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, March 29, V/1970.127 Satanis is available as DVD #ID1615SWDVD from “Something Weird Video”,Seattle, Washington. The box cover cheerfully states: “‘Areligion based on man’s carnal needs’ is how ‘Satanist Minister’ Anton SzandorLaVey describes his Church of Satan in the fascinatingdocumentary Satanis, the Devil’s Mass, an up-close look at LaVey and the Satanicshenanigans filmed inside his famous San Francisco ‘BlackHouse’ in 1969 (sic). From the nude women decorating the altar to the mandressed as a bishop who gets his fanny whipped before climbinginto a coffin with a naked gal, we’re treated to interviews with LaVey and hisflock (‘We’re maybe more normal than normal people!’) as wellas various startled neighbors (‘He has completely sold himself to the Devil!’),all of which is sandwiched between scenes of a Black Massfeaturing hilariously-corny B-movie booga-booga and LaVey wearing silly littledevil horns. Regardless of your take on Anton or the Devil,Satanis is a wonderfully-oddball look at one of America’s darkest pop-culturecuriosities.”- 75 -San Francisco’s Church of Satan has a reputation for orgy and mad perversity inthe middle-classneighborhood where it is located. It shows interested outsiders a film calledSatanis which purportedlyreflects the Church’s rituals - black-robed men and women conducting a BlackMass (a mocking inversionof the Christian Mass) with a nude woman for an altar. Members proclaim theirhate and lust, and leaderAnton LaVey blesses them: “May all your lustful thoughts reach fruition. Hail,Satan!” A trouserless man isflagellated on a coffin lid; then the coffin opens to reveal a nude girl, theman descends into the coffin, and itis closed - or almost closed, for it is now a bit crowded.So things go in the film. But a few weeks ago Newsweek’s Nick Kazan was screenedfor membership inthe Church of Satan by seven black-hooded members in a candlelit basementdecorated with human skulls.He found the whole ritual “not only unfrightening but comically reminiscent offraternity initiations”. Thenhe attended the mass itself. The service, he reported, “contained very little ofthe film’s drama or nudity andin fact was a highly stylized, arcane bore”. The flagellant in this mass notonly wore trousers but had placeda copy of Playboy inside them for padding.The air of anticlimax continued as Satanic High Priest LaVey, a 39-year-oldformer lion tamer andpolice photographer, delivered a calm and learned exposition of his religion ofindulgence and “controlledselfishness”. Although his cult is inexpensive to join ($20 for a lifetimemembership), LaVey claimed thatwith 7,000 fee-paying members it was highly prosperous. The only hints ofextremism about LaVey himselfwere a swastika and a Confederate flag beside his desk. “These are symbols ofaggression and power,” heexplained, “that may be used in later rituals.” Perhaps significantly, too, noblacks or Jews were at themass. 128Anton wrote to Newsweek pointing out that the Church’s membership included bothex-Jews andNegroes, and that membership screenings were not intended to terrify. He added:If one cannot see the sardonic element implied by the placing of the Playboymagazine inside the seatof the flagellant’s trousers, then I suppose the viewer would consider justabout anything an “arcane bore”short of a Doris Day or John Wayne movie.Regarding the swastika and Confederate flags which were observed by yourreporter beside my desk,surely he also must have noticed in the same room the collection of tortureimplements from the Inquisitionwhich were representative of Christian “justice”. Why were these artifacts notmentioned in your article? 129As it turned out, Newsweek had editorially altered the reporter’s actual accountwithout his consent.Kazan wrote to Anton saying that the final story did not reflect his trueopinion of him or the Church: “Ihave warm feelings toward both. I hope you know that - even if I should becursed and excommunicated -I will remain, in spirit, a disciple of Satan.” 130The May 1970 Cloven Hoof, in which this exchange was recounted, also containedsome of Anton’swords of wisdom on the Church of Satan’s infamous nude altars. He stressed thehonor and solemnity ofthe office and cited dedication, awareness, belief in the power of magic, andfaith in Satanism as essentialqualities for the altar. He continued:It is for this reason that “professionals” seldom make good altars. The toplessdancer or stripper is tooaccustomed to using her body as a livelihood to become enthused about displayingit for overt magicalpurposes. Hence she will often feel she is giving it as a form of charity to theGrotto should she “consent” toserve as an altar. Her awareness during the ceremony becomes one of a volunteerperformer, and she mightas well be holding forth on a U.S.O. stage, dancing for G.I.s. If such a girl isdedicated enough, however,her professional background should not stand in her way. Of course a bored orblase attitude is a sign youhave chosen the wrong altar.128 “The Cult of the Occult”, Newsweek, April 13, 1970.129 Letter, Anton LaVey to Newsweek, in Cloven Hoof, May V/1970, page #5.130 Letter, Nick Kazan to Anton LaVey, in Cloven Hoof, May V/1970, page #5.- 76 -It is far better that the woman serving as altar be self-conscious, nervous,even downright embarrassedthan to swing up to the altar platform like a zoo monkey who then proceeds topeel a banana and watch thecrowd.131The underground newspaper Berkeley Barb, long a counterculture anchor in the bayarea, had kinder ifequally irreverent comments concerning the documentary:I began hearing about LaVey and his nude altars and roaring lions right after Icame out here in 1966.Which is about the same time that everyone else began hearing about him too. Infact I heard so much abouthim that I figured he was nothing more than a slightly sulfuric Jim Moran, orperhaps a not-so-merryprankster… LaVey never even says “hell” without capitalizing the “H”. He won’tlet his 17-year-olddaughter Karla (Yummy!) attend services. And as for the magic itself - Well,Black or not, it’s kind of nice.You can either use it to get laid [Pardon. “To summon one for lustful purpose orestablish a sexuallygratifying situation.”], to help someone, or to destroy an enemy. Now don’t getme wrong; I’m not knockingLaVey or his productions. The film is skillfully made and thoroughlyentertaining. Even the Satanic Bible,despite the vaguely Zarathustran air of the “Book of Satan” and the extremeliturgidity of the nineteenEnochian Keys, has a lot of good advice and a few flashes of insight.It’s just that, behind all those Satanic trappings, this particular Devil seemslike a hell of a nice guy. 132The Berkeley Tribe, the Bay Area’s other underground newspaper, also reviewedSatanis:This has been a hard piece to write because the subject is so crazed …It’s a documentary. One cat in a dark suit and shoes with white socks says,“Yeah, before I joined theSatanic Church I masturbated once a day and was very unhappy about it. Now Imasturbate three or fourtimes a day and really dig it.”During one ritual a naked woman takes a large snake and rubs it over her body,up and down in hercrotch, passing her hands over its length and wrapping it around her. Then shegives it to Anton, who’sdressed in an open-front hood with horns, all in black. He takes the snake overto a plump blonde, boundnaked to a post, and proceeds to touch its head to various parts of her body,around each breast and down tothe cunt. 133An old man who lives in a house neighboring the all-black Victorian onCalifornia Street says he’s nottoo sure what goes on there, but he wishes they’d keep up their back yard betterbecause it brings propertyvalues down.Anton seemed like a nice dude, although his appearance was consciouslyDevil-like. Later I found outhe worked on the premise that he’d be nice to you as long as you were nice tohim, but he isn’t into turningthe other cheek if you cross him.Anton’s not a nut. In many ways he’s beyond the Church that he’s heading. He’sgot a pretty good basefor what he is, but it seems off to me. I just believe that man can get higherthan he’s shown he can, butwhether he will is another thing. It ain’t been goin’ too well lately, and Antonmay prove right in the end. 134A reporter for the John Birch Society’s American Opinion magazine, who visited6114 in May. He toowas greeted by the irrepressible Ferro:After a considerable time the door was opened cautiously by an ashen-faced mandressed in the flowingrobes of a priest. He was clearly not a priest in any good sense, for about hisneck hung a silver medallion inthe shape of the Goat of Mendes.131 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, May V/1970, page #13.132 Ogar, Richard in Berkeley Barb, March V/1970.133 The snake was a boa constrictor named Julius Squeezer.134 Sundog, “Go to Hell” in Berkeley Tribe, March 13-20, 1970, page #6.- 77 -He scanned the bookcase of the Purple Room in horror:There were books by assorted Fabian conspirators and by identified CommunistHoward Fast. Copies ofMein Kampf and Das Kapital were slotted amidst dozens of expensive volumes onSatan worship andsexual deviation. There was a well-thumbed copy of the Communist Manifesto.And he didn’t care for Anton LaVey:As we discussed the various divisions of membership in his Church, the telephonerang and my hosttook a call from someone he identified as Melvin Belli. I remembered that Bellihas long been a member ofthe Communist Front National Lawyers Guild and was the attorney who initiallydefended Jack Ruby - theman who “executed” Communist Lee Harvey Oswald. I noticed that LaVey wore amedallion with asuperimposed lightning bolt, a symbol like that displayed by the NationalStates’ Rights Party … I peeredinto the cellar and caught a glimpse of something red hanging on the wall. Itwas the flag of the U.S.S.R. 135A charming contrast to Anton LaVey’s actual views as expressed to me [Chapter#4]. On the III°examination I was taking in South Vietnam, there was a question: “If someonewere to attack the Churchof Satan on the grounds that it is inclined towards fascism in its politicalimplications, name twophilosophers you might cite to justify the Church’s position. Explain yourchoice.” I answered:Fascism is more or less synonymous with totalitarianism, i.e. a political systemrequiring strictadherence to proclaimed doctrine. Nothing could be more repellent to theSatanist! In effect fascism ismerely the repressive dogmatism of theist churches removed to a secular setting.As such it would beirreconcilable with Satanism, which advocates unrestrained enjoyment of humanfreedom.Two theorists I might recommend to the Satanic student are Johann Fichte andGeorg Hegel. Fichte, an18th-century German metaphysician, authored the theory of subjective idealism,an elaboration uponBerkeley’s more theist-oriented idealism. Central to Fichte’s thesis is thecontention that mind is acontinually creative and evolving entity, generating the various features of theexternal world. This issimply the antithesis to materialism. Fichte’s philosophy is furtherdifferentiated from simple solipsism -which portrays the Universe as just “my self, my mind, and its ideas” - byhypothesizing a more impersonalego, a creative agency from whom each individual mind is derivative (an ideaclosely akin to our concept ofSatan). Hegel’s philosophy is a more pragmatic, less ethereal variation uponthis same theme, contendingthat the Universe can only be understood in terms of an objective or absolutemind, which has beenevolving throughout the world’s history into a transcendent, self-containedbeing. All historical events,according to Hegel, represent the inner struggle of this absolute to achievecomplete self-realization, theprocess of this struggle being Hegel’s famous thesis/antithesis-synthesissequence. Hegel’s originaldialectic idealism should not be confused with Marx’ dialectic materialism,which is quite unSatanic andindeed adaptable to fascist/totalitarian doctrine. 136One question on the examination called for the aspirant’s definition of thePriesthood. I wrote:The Satanic Priest is the vital personification of the Will of Satan and of theideals represented by theInfernal Pantheon. He is dedicated to the ultimate ennoblement of man, and tothe destruction of allartificially-created barriers to this goal. He recognizes no moral restrictionsupon his modes of action, yet heaccepts full responsibility for all consequences of his designs. He is acreature of ego, to whom the only“sin” is hypocrisy.Within the medium of the Satanic Church, the Priest concentrates his efforts insuch directions as willmost effectively promote the growth of Satanism in all of its manifestations. Inthis he is guided by the High135 Gumaer, David, “Satanism: A Practical Guide to Witch Hunting”, AmericanOpinion, September 1970.136 Aquino, M.A., III° Examination, May V/1970, page #6.- 78 -Priest and advised by the Council of the Order of the Trapezoid. His mostimmediate concern is themembership of the Church, who have explicitly pledged their desire to explorethe mysteries of the Left-Hand Path, and he encourages them to realize their most exotic ambitions. He isan Adept of relationships,not of absolutes, and he is quick to challenge any standard by which one manpresumes to dictate thejudgments of many. He recognizes that elusive line between coordination ofeffort and the strangulation ofindividual genius by mass dogma, and he spares no effort to bring about thedissolution of all institutions,spiritual and secular, which regard the societies of man as mere machines forthe pleasure of a select few.As a wizard of Black Magic the Satanic Priest is entrusted with both thecreative and the destructivepowers of Hell; he is charged to wield these forces with precision andjudiciousness, that the Prince ofDarkness not be forced to bear the consequences of his error. And finally hemust never cease to probe hisown intellect for the inconsistencies within, for a static existence is theSatanic anathema. 137Looking over my answer to a question on the meaning of lycanthropy, it occurs tome that thegentleman from the Birch Society might be a prime werewolf candidate:Lycanthropy is a form of acute schizophrenic panic in which an individual,psychologically constrictedby what he understands to be his “human” condition [including, by the way, the“seven deadly sins”],achieves emotional emancipation by believing himself a non-human animal.Superstitious tradition andignorant fear of mental abnormalities caused such psychotics to be popularlyidentified as “werewolves” [orbears, tigers, etc.], and the proliferation of such tales often inspired theafflicted psychotic to fancy himself agenuine werewolf. Lycanthropy is a particularly ugly consequence of the doctrineof abstinence and ego-denial which the theist churches have forced upon their adherents. It is all themore irritating since thetheists impudently pronounced lycanthropy to be a symptom of Satanism anddevil-worship. In fact theencouragement of rational self-indulgence practiced by the Church of Satanrenders an occurrence oflycanthropy - or irrational self-indulgence - extremely unlikely. 138The two extended essays required on the examination are at Appendices #16 and#17.Anton LaVey, I was to discover, had a “thing” about astrology himself. A year orso previously he hadwritten a “rainbow” sheet essay entitled “God in Sports Clothes -or- The Stars:A Vitamin Supplement forWeak Egos” (Appendix #18), ridiculing the [re]growing astrology craze. The essaywas later adapted forand included in The Compleat Witch.On the evening of June 21-22, the North Solstice of the Satanic Year Five, Ientered the main ritualchamber of the Central Grotto and, with John Ferro and Janet as witnesses, wasordained by AntonSzandor LaVey to the Priesthood of Mendes III°. Although I have since attainedhigher states of Initiation,none compares in significance to the Priesthood - the moment at which a humanbeing ceases to beenergized solely by his own Will and partakes of a stronger, purer, infinitelymore ancient essence - theWill of the Prince of Darkness himself.It is a consecration so profound, so ennobling that to compare conventionalreligious priesthoods to itis the most pathetic of mockeries. Hence one’s initial elation upon experiencingthe true Priesthood soongives way to shock and consternation at the woeful condition of profanehumankind. Only his recognitionof the hatred and fear with which humanity reacts to alien states ofconsciousness prevents the Priest fromimmediately resolving to blaze a path of illumination through the darknesssurrounding him. I withdrewinto my Self to contemplate this bewildering new perspective upon existence.In the July Hoof John Ferro emphasized this realization to the generalmembership:That each of us has certain capacities and limitations cannot be denied. Thateach of us, as a Satanist,has the duty and obligation to develop to the extent of those capacities and torecognize his limitations137 Ibid., page #3.138 Ibid.- 79 -cannot be denied either. Some would find this harsh, saying that the individualmust be cushioned against anawareness of his limitations - that we are all nourished by a little illusion.There is but one response to sucha doctrine. If you fear the truth and if you wish to live a life of illusion,then take your place among theover-schooled but undereducated masses, accept the camaraderie of thecommonality, but do not callyourself a Satanist.139After the ceremony I was informed by Anton that I was henceforth to be a memberof the governingbody of the Church, the Council of Nine. This Council had taken its name fromthe legend of the NineUnknown Men, recounted by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in their Morning ofthe Magicians asfollows: Asoka, Emperor of the Maurya Kingdom of India from approximately 274 to236 BCE, became afollower of Buddhism in about 260 BCE. He became famous for administering thenation according to themost enlightened principles of nonviolence, and before his death he selectednine great sages to form asecret, protective society to carry on his work. Each One of the Nine wouldselect nine deputies known tohim alone, and each of those nine would select an additional nine, etc. Thelegend was popularized inTalbot Mundy’s 1925 novel The Nine Unknown. 140 The Church of Satan’s Council ofNine - also known inits early days as the Council of the Trapezoid - was explained by “John M.Kincaid” (a pseudonym forAnton or Diane LaVey) in the December 1970 Cloven Hoof:The Order of the Trapezoid is the “Board of Directors” and security staff of theChurch. Its functionsare many and its members are chosen by appointment, according to each’s specialabilities and attributes.All Priests and Priestesses are automatically admitted into the Order, althoughthe identities of mostmembers of the Order are unknown even to each other. Members of the Governing orGrand Council of theTrapezoid are known only to the High Priest, who solicits their aid whenrequired. 141“Kincaid” hinted darkly of the magical significance of the geometric figurecomprising the Order’sname and insignia. The curious and the resourceful, he said, would be able toderive important clues fromWilliam Mortensen’s The Command to Look142 , Louis McCarty’s The Great PyramidJeezeh143 , Chapter27 of Sheila Ostrander & Lynn Schroeder’s Psychic Discoveries Behind the IronCurtain144 , FrankBelknap Long’s The Hounds of Tindalos145 , and H.P. Lovecraft’s The Haunter ofthe Dark146 .139 Ferro, John in Cloven Hoof, July V/1970, page #6.140 Pauwels, Louis and Bergier, Jacques, The Morning of the Magicians. New York:Avon Books #N-192, 1960, pages #67-70.141 LaVey, Anton “John M. Kincaid” in Cloven Hoof, December V/1970, page #4.142 This obscure book was tracked down and analyzed by Stephen Flowers, GrandMaster of the Order of the Trapezoid, in a 1986 article forthe Order’s Runes newsletter. It is reprinted here as Appendix #19.143 An early “exposé” of the geometric peculiarities of the Great Pyramid ofGiza. The most fact-filled, sensible, and concise book on thistopic I have yet encountered is Wm. R. Fix’ Pyramid Odyssey (New York: MayflowerBooks, 1978, ISBN 0-8317-7160-7). See also Appendix#35 and the “truncated pyramid” symbolism in the “Ceremony of the Nine Angles”(Appendix #72).144 This 1970 book stunned the West (6 hardcover printings in its first 6months!) with its revelations of Soviet & other Eastern Bloc researchinto parapsychology. [Not mentioned in the book was the fact that the KGBoperated four secret laboratories for such studies, of which themost closely-guarded (M4, under D.G. Mirza) was concerned specifically withBlack Magic. The Temple of Set would later explore thisresearch through Michael Murphy’s Transformation Project.] Chapter #27 of PDBICwas an early discussion of “pyramid power” as theability of certain geometric shapes & solids to act as “resonators” for varioustypes of cosmic energy.145 See Appendix #5 (Die Elektrischen Vorspiele) and Frank Belknap Long’scomments to M.A. Aquino in Chapter #22.146 A 1936 story in which the mischievous HPL “killed” his friend & fellowauthor Robert Bloch (“Robert Blake”) in retaliation for Bloch’searlier “killing” of him in his Shambler from the Stars. A central feature ofthe HPL story was a “Shining Trapezohedron” which acted as agateway to other dimensions. Bloch would later re-retaliate in The Shadow fromthe Steeple. All of these stories would be republished in bookcollections by Arkham House, and are probably available in various HPL/RBanthologies.- 80 -Soon after my ordination I attended my first meeting as a member of the Council.After a brief reviewof the Church’s program for the coming months, the Councillors assembled in aroom used to interviewprospective members of the Church in San Francisco. We donned black hoods androbes and seatedourselves about a coffin that served for the moment as a table. The aspirant, ayoung woman, was ledbefore us, whereupon we asked questions of her designed to bring out her motivesand interests. We thenvoted by one or two blows on the coffin-lid with our fists. It may have been atouch theatrical, but I’mcertain it was an evening that the lady herself would not soon forget.The tenth of July was Diane LaVey’s birthday, and Anton invited me to design andconduct acommemorative ritual. How to match, much less surpass the flamboyance of a 6114California Streetceremony? Janet and I put our heads together, then dashed south to WesternCostume, that giant repositoryof wonders in Hollywood. Janet gold-leafed herself from head to foot, donned oneof Anne Baxter’soutfits from The Ten Commandments, and arose from a mummy-case to greet thestartled Diane as theEgyptian goddess Nepthys, consort of Set and the first of the “Devil-queens” ofhistorical mythology.During a private meeting at the Central Grotto in late June, Anton showed me themanuscript of theMissa Solemnis (Appendix #7), researched and written for him by a new WarlockII° in Michigan namedWayne West. It was now to receive its first performance at the Central Grotto,and I was to officiate.It was, of course, an opportunity too unique to miss - Priest at the first HighBlack Mass at the CentralGrotto of the Church of Satan! Even though my own approach to Satanism wasn’tparticularly anti-Catholic, I determined to give the Missa Solemnis my utmost.The great evening arrived, and I entered the ritual chamber feeling blatantlyblasphemous. Present atthe stone altar to assist me were two other Priests, James Moody (who had notyet left for Ireland) andLawrence Green (who would later head San Francisco’s second Grotto).There had been only a slight emergency prior to the ritual: The Satanist who hadbeen charged toacquire a holy wafer for desecration had failed in his mission. The Age of Satanground to a momentaryhalt while this crisis was considered. Finally Diane came to the rescue with aEuphrates cracker from thekitchen, and the Missa Solemnis got under way.Generally the Church of Satan’s famous nude altar girls reclined just below theSigil of Baphomet withthe grace of ancient Greek statues. The altar for this Black Mass, however, wasa Whore of Babylonstraight out of an Aleister Crowley mural. Garishly painted and powdered, shesat brazenly andimmodestly atop the stone fireplace, her legs spread wide in preparation for theviolation of the Host.From his medieval throne across the chamber glowered Anton, looking his mostroyal rotten. On his rightwas Diane, trying to look stern despite the ever-present twinkle in her eyes. Tohis left stood Janet, holdingthe silver sword that Anton had consecrated for me and obviously enjoying myinability to concentrate onthe text Larry Green was holding.We commenced the ritual. In a short time the Central Grotto congregation[carefully screened for suchan “extreme” event] was captivated. All went smoothly until the desecration ofthe Host. There I haddetermined to add my own accent to the proceedings by a liberal dose of Dragon’sBreath in the firebrazier below the altar. I flung the Dragon’s Breath and got my effect, allright - a blaze that not only leaptout into the chamber but singed, as it were, the dignity of the altar girl aswell. 147147 All right - In the interests of full historical disclosure: The altar’sresponse to having her pubic hair set on fire was “Ow! God damnit!” [While arguably thematically blasphemous, this was not in the MissaSolemnis script.] She promptly swatted the fire out while I stoodthere paralyzed and Diane and Janet both dissolved in laughter. Anton, to hiscredit, maintained a completely straight face. I don’t recall anyparticular response from the assemblage; perhaps they thought it was anespecially dramatic highlight of the ceremony. I guess it was,although this never happened to Roman Castevet or Mocata. As for Satan, heprobably just rolled his eyes.[index-81_1.jpg]- 81 -Satanism will undoubtedly continue to conduct its perverse ceremonies andpractice its sex orgies indark and secret places.

Pal.John L. WassermanSan Francisco Chronicle (March 1970)- 84 -[index-85_1.jpg]- 85 -In July of 1970 Janet and I left San Francisco for Kentucky, the Army havingassigned me to theArmor Center at Fort Knox. 148 We rented a small white house in the ruralvillage of Brandenburg, aboutthirty miles from the nearest major highway and about fifty miles south ofLouisville. Brandenburg wasabout six blocks long and about three blocks wide, and its chief claim to famewas that the local hotel (theDoe Run Inn) had been started by Daniel Boone’s father.I looked at the white house in exasperation. I would have preferred an ancient,burned-out Gothicabbey, but this would have to do. The living area of the house remainedpristine, but the attic soon becamea jet-black ritual chamber dominated by a glowing red Sigil of Baphomet. 701Bland Street was on its wayto becoming Brandenburg’s second landmark, if one that would be talked aboutonly in furtive whispersby the local population. Anton LaVey offered some decorative advice in theCloven Hoof:Room size: If your area is no bigger than a closet, just limit the length ofyour sword. It is far better tohave a small dagger with a tastefully decorated but miniscule chamber than toown a grand sword with noplace to swing it.Soundproofing: There’s no point in conducting a secret ceremony if everyone elsecan hear you, soconsider this when you construct your chamber. It is not necessary to screamyour invocations at the top ofyour lungs; it is the deliberation of your delivery that counts.Color: Black is limitless in perspective when properly lighted. Contrary topopular belief, black is lessconfining and therefore more conducive to the expulsion of the will. [He went onto suggest suchalternatives as scarlet, silver, orange, blue, purple, and the use of hangingsand mirrors.]Lighting: So long as candles are employed, tastefully dramatic artificiallighting may augment them.Murals: Some suggestions are: Demonic landscapes, nightmare visions, eccentricand confusingangles, wraiths, gnarled and twisted trees, storm- and lightning-swept skies,volcanic peaks, broken ruins,flames, broken battlements against a night sky, the Sigil of Baphometsuperimposed on a full Mooncentered over a storm-tossed or quietly rippling sea,Egyptian/Roman/Greek/Norse, etc. design motifs,nymphs and satyrs in a bacchanal, etc. Let’s see a stained glass window crammedwith saints stand up to awallful of the aforementioned for sheer drama!Gongs: Gongs that don’t sound like a hub cap when struck are often hard to comeby. Rather than dowithout the brazen sound so highly desired in ceremonies, substitute a goodcrash cymbal.Musical Equipment: The emphasis should be on solemnity and dignity, howevertribal. Avoid bongoslike the plague; this is a Satanic Temple, not a coffee house.148 During this tour one of my additional assignments was to update theclassified plan for the land defense of Fort Knox in case of invasion.I’m not sure whether this was a Civil War leftover, a World War III contingency,or, more charmingly, a paranoid reaction to Goldfinger. Whatit did do was give me, unlike all civilians and post military personnel, accessto the sacred grounds and shrine of the U.S. Bullion Depository.[Not even the Goldfinger film crew had been allowed this; Eon had to build itsown full-scale replica at Pinewood Studios in England.] I wasdisappointed to discover that the interior looked nothing like the dazzlingchamber of the Bond movie; all of the gold bars are protectivelywrapped because of their softness and stored in closed rooms.- 86 -Miscellaneous Artifacts: Appropriate wall hangings (not posters), sconces,chandeliers, masks, studdeddoors, weaponry, vials, retorts, stuffed animals, skulls, mummified remains,coffins - in general, all thingsyou’d expect to see in an old Boris Karloff movie! Don’t worry about being“phony”. The idea is to makeyou feel like what you are supposed to be, so let any harmless butwell-established imagery work for you. 149In August, while we continued our unhallowed renovations in Brandenburg, a copyof the SatanicBible was acquired by a raven-haired fashion model in New York City. She decidedthat it made sense toher and applied for membership in the Church. She was particularly annoyed bythe tone of mediacoverage at the time, and she voiced her indignation in a letter to the Hoof:I’ve been noticing that when Satanism is mentioned on television, usually in thecourse of some moviemade for television, the statements made about it are outright distortions orgarbled facts and ridiculousmyths. It really incenses me that the writers of these programs feed thisnonsense about us to the public,most of whom don’t bother to investigate but take it all in as fact. I urge allmembers to keep aware of suchthings and to voice their objections either verbally or perhaps through lettersto editors or some other suchmethod. Lest we fall into a habit of sitting back and being Satanists in nameonly, we should activelypractice our religion, not only now and then but on a day-to-day basis.Rege Satanas!Lilith Sinclair I°150At the University of Louisville a tall, scholarly-looking occultist namedClifford Amos had beengiving a series of seminars on witchcraft of the “White” variety. In September,after visiting one of theseseminars, I was invited to present a guest lecture. The seminars usually drewabout 20-30 students, but onthe evening of October 7th over two hundred came to the campus auditorium tosample a genuine SatanicPriest.Somewhat to my surprise - inasmuch as Louisville lies in the heart of the “Biblebelt” - the lecturewent smoothly and pleasantly, with no heckling of any sort. At its close abouttwenty persons cameforward to inquire about Church membership, and of that number I endorsed aboutten or twelve of themost suitable applications for forwarding to San Francisco. “We’re ecstatic overyour progress,” wroteDiane LaVey. “From the sounds of it, it would appear that you’ll soon convertthe entire U.L. campus toSatanism.” 151Cliff Amos, who was among those applying, proposed that the new Grotto be named“Nineveh” afterthe capital of the ancient Assyrian Empire. [The Assyrians had been famed fortheir cavalry, andLouisville, site of the Kentucky Derby, is very horse-conscious.] A charter forthe Nineveh Grotto dulyarrived, and on All Hallows Eve the little white house in Brandenburg was thesetting for nameless ritesand unspeakable orgies of appropriate celebration. As I wrote to Anton:For this occasion Satan himself was invoked, and I spoke from the firstStatement of the Diabolicon.The candidates for Initiation were then led one by one before the altar. Iadministered the enclosed oath,then touched him upon the forehead with my ring [a miniature III° Baphomet].Upon the altar was set asmall brass chalice which, when ritually ignited, emitted a dark blue flame; andeach of the Baphometmedallions was held above the flame in turn. Dragon’s Breath caused eachmedallion to be momentarilyenveloped in the fire, after which it was presented to the new member. Theceremony was closed by my149 LaVey, Anton, “Helpful Hints on Developing a Satanic Ritual Chamber in theHome -or- The Family that Preys Together Stays Together”in Cloven Hoof, November V/1970, pages #3-6.150 Sinclair, Lilith in Cloven Hoof, October V, 1970, page #6.151 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 27, V/1970.- 87 -reading of the Eighteenth Enochian Key. The subsequent party - including a largedevil’s-food cake withBaphomet icing - continued until three or four in the morning. 152Until that evening no oath had accompanied Initiation into the Church of Satan.The oath that I wrotefor Nineveh was subsequently adopted by the Church and appeared in a modifiedform in the SatanicRituals as part of the Satanic Baptism. Here is the original text:I, [name], having forsworn the divine mindlessness, do proclaim the majesty ofmy own being amongthe marvels of the Universe. I reject oblivion of Self, and I accept thepleasure and pain of unique existence.I am returned from death to life, and I declare my friendship with Lucifer, theLord of Light who is exaltedas Satan. I receive the Sigil of Baphomet [here the Baphomet medallion istouched to the Initiate’s brow],and I embrace the Black Flame of the Order of the Trapezoid. [Here the medallionis passed through theFlame and then placed around the Initiate’s neck.]153The following year Anton LaVey wrote and distributed to Grottos a Ceremony ofSatanic Baptism(Appendix #20). The details of the text are illustrative of the seriousness andthe literal authenticity withwhich Anton regarded his office and his trust. The text is identical to thelater version that appeared in theSatanic Rituals, with the exception that this original text included theadjuration “under severe penalty ofdestruction and ruin, to safeguard the secrets of the Church of Satan and itsmembership from any and allpersons who may seek information as to the structure, ritual, magical teachingsor any other workings ofthe Church which are not a matter of public knowledge”. Since the SatanicRituals offered “sanitized”versions of all of the included rituals - assuming that members of theuninitiated public could thenexperiment with them - mention of the Church of Satan or of its internaloperations was omitted from thepublished Baptism.In the November Cloven Hoof “John M. Kincaid” discussed the degree-system of theChurch,elaborating particularly upon the IV° and V°:The IV° is that of Satanic Master and is conferred upon those who have served inthe capacity of Priestor Priestess for a considerable time, developing and enlarging their Grottosuntil other Priests are needed intheir area. Depending upon the magnitude of their authority, those of the IV°are called Magister Caverni(=bishop), Magister Templi (=archbishop), or Magister Magnus (=cardinal).Because these are appointedpositions, much more than examinations or obvious attributes are considered asqualifications. All IV°members are automatically Knights or Dames Templar.The title of Magus V° is conferred upon members of the IV° who have discoveredand brought forth anew magical principle and utilized it in a manner that profoundly affects theactivities of the world. Theposition held by Anton LaVey as High Priest is monarchical in nature, papal indegree, and absolute inpower. His exalted position is the result of doing what no other man has done inthe span of a millennium:bringing Satanism into the world as an organized, legitimate, abovegroundpersuasion - and with it restoringthe dignity of man’s own godhead. 154Comparing the degree-system of the Church of Satan to those of earlierinitiatory occult groups, I hadencountered the name of Aleister Crowley. In 1970 not too much material wasavailable on this curiouscharacter - a Castle Books edition of his Magick in Theory and Practice and hisautobiographicalConfessions. Crowley’s protests to the contrary, I detected in him the essenceof a Black, not a White152 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, November 2, V/1970.153 Aquino, M.A., Nineveh Grotto Initiation Ceremony, first used October 31,V/1970.154 LaVey, Anton “John M. Kincaid”, “An Explanation of the Various Degrees ofthe Church of Satan” in Cloven Hoof, November V/1970,pages #7-8.- 88 -Magician. I offered my thoughts in an essay which was published in the Hoof(Appendix #21). Antoncommented:I am delighted with your essay on Crowley for the Cloven Hoof. It will surelyhelp to clarify the manymisconceptions about him that the members have undoubtedly read - now that he’sbecome fashionable.It doesn’t amaze me as much as it used to that those supposedly interested inexploring the unknownand traveling the uncharted regions of the dark realm never consider reading abook that hasn’t been toutedas a great o-c-c-u-l-t masterpiece. They ramble through life expecting touncover the mysteries of theuniverse and are totally convinced of their unexcelled perception, but theydisregard anything which doesn’tfit within their narrow frame of reference.Then, when someone else happens to make the discovery for them, they (each onein turn) informothers of their great insight in recognizing the value of a man or validity of athought, with much sage-likesmugness.For years Magick in Theory and Practice sat gathering dust on bookshelves untilexasperated dealersrelegated the faded purple volumes to the “remaindered” tables. Now that A.C.has been “approved” by the“learned ones”, the masses have, of course, become all but hysterical over thepoor old boy. Since most ofhis disciples accept every word that is written about him as gospel, no matterhow conflicting the variousaccounts may be, your essay will help to set them straight. 155The month of November also saw the Nineveh Grotto further publicized by twooutside events. ArthurLyons’ The Second Coming: Satanism in America hit the bookstores - which alertedLouisville to theexciting/disturbing news that it too was hosting the insidious Church of Satan.Secondly a film profilingcontemporary occult movements, Witchcraft ’70, arrived in town. The mostprominent segment of themovie had been shot in the ritual chamber of the Central Grotto, with Anton andhis assistants performinga cameo ceremony for the benefit of the cameras. I wrote to Anton:I certainly hope that you find Witchcraft ’70 more acceptable than we did. As aconsequence of thefilm’s local engagement, we have had to rebut repeatedly the charge that theChurch is a mere device forfinancial exploitation. 156He replied:It is regrettable but not surprising that we do not fare well in Witchcraft ’70.I’m sure the film hasdisintegrated into something far different than the original production, and Ihave every reason to believethat the translation and perhaps even re-editing by whoever is responsible forturning foreign productionsinto films which will be palatable to American audiences has turned it into thetypical, sensationalizeddocumentary so beloved by our fellow countrymen.I have had many favorable comments from friends and associates in Europe who sawit in its originalform. I have not yet seen it, but I’m not expecting to be pleased. If you wereas upset about it as Janet toldDiane you were, then I doubt that I’ll be ecstatic over it.I have, however, become somewhat hardened to the sort of sensationalismprevalent in most coverageof the Church. It doesn’t infuriate me as it used to, because we have receivedsome of the best response as aconsequence of several of the most lurid, biased reports on us, incredible as itmay sound.It seems that the right people will see through the sham and extract and retainonly the best particles ofwhat might be totally offensive to those on the inside who know the truesituation. 157The Cloven Hoof’s review of Witchcraft ’70 was curt and to the point:155 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 22, V/1970.156 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, November 19, V/1970.157 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 22, V/1970.- 89 -Sadly, Witchcraft ’70, once it reached our shores, fell victim to the shoddyexploitation in which thiscountry has no peers. It is difficult to decide which is more repugnant - theAmerican additions to the film(both of which include animal sacrifice and blood feasts) or the ignorance ofthe derisively moralisticnarrative. Perhaps the only individuals more disgusted than ourselves with theAmerican version were thefine gentlemen who made the original European version, which was criticallyacclaimed but bore littleresemblance to the American bastardization. 158In pondering such presentations of the Church, Anton LaVey decided to say a fewwords to themembership not only about Satanic morality, but about the virtue of theorganization itself:Any minority group is a target for vicious Christian “love”, alias repressedhate, alias unwarrantedbigotry. It is only through numbers and organization that stigmas are broken andrespect is enforced. Yes,you read right. Then, if the person demanding respect is worthy of it, it willbe sustained. Most Satanists arebasically kinder, more considerate people than their Christian detractors. Classwill tell, and when it hasbeen observed that a society of Satanists is a more just, stable, andself-realized society than that which hasgone before, the Satanist will become an exemplar.I become angered whenever I am confronted with complaints from a practitioner ofthe Black Arts thus:“Your philosophy is okay, but why do you have to have a ‘church’ and‘organization’? Why not let peopledo their own thing? Why all the red tape?”To even the most naïve, fledgling witch the answers to these questions should beobvious. The“independent” spirits who raise such objections have no business callingthemselves magicians if they can’tsee the rudimentary logic in the need for organization, especially to overcomean unjust situation. While itis true that great movements start with a handful of people, it takes organizednumbers of those who believein the original idea to carry it to a formidable position. Once such a positionis attained, stigma will vanishand popularity will ensue, followed by majority acceptance. Then and only thenwill the once-stigmatizinglabel of “witch” become synonymous with “right”. 159Nineveh was not the first Grotto to be chartered outside of San Francisco. Ithad been preceded a shorttime earlier by the Babylon Grotto in Detroit, headed by Wayne West (now III°),and the Plutonian Grottoin Denver, headed by a Priest named Adrian-Claude Frazier. West’s personalhistory was somewhatobscure. He claimed to be an ex-Roman Catholic priest, and his script for theMissa Solemnis certainlyevidenced his firm command of both Catholic ritual and Latin. I would never meethim face to face, but Idid see a photograph of him at a later date - showing an alert, aggressive facewith eyes that weresimultaneously smiling and piercing. To me he wrote:Your curiosity concerning my formal religious background comes as something of asurprise to me,since I had assumed you were familiar with my priestly ordination in the RomanCatholic Church. Indeed Irather delight in the knowledge that even though I am persona non grata,excommunicado, and anathema, Iam still, under the Law of Melchisedech, a priest forever. This does not takeaway from my solipsisticfantasies, but contributes substantially to them. I have found my joy in Satan,and I’d have a Hell of a timetrying to change now. But I shan’t bore you with the details of the putrescenceof Christian infamy sinceyou are already well-versed in that particular subject.160Whatever the facts concerning West’s background might be, his hatred forChristianity was almostpathological. One suspects that as a youth he must have suffered horribly underthe Catholic moral andeducational yoke to have become so embittered towards it. Anton LaVey consideredChristianity as158 LaVey, Anton, Review of Witchcraft ’70 in Cloven Hoof, January VI/1971,pages #9-10.159 LaVey, Anton, “Offensive Defense for Satanists” in Cloven Hoof, JanuaryVI/1971, pages #3-4.160 Letter, Wayne West to M.A. Aquino, February 1, VI/1971.- 90 -“useless lumber and wreckage” - more of an annoyance to be exposed and ridiculedthan a real threat tothe modern Satanist. West, on the other hand, regarded it as his mortal enemyand the epitome ofeverything hateful. His Missa Solemnis is illustrative; one can see why Antonfelt it necessary to tone itdown by about 75% for inclusion in the Satanic Rituals.On the other hand, Wayne West’s devotion to the Church of Satan and to AntonLaVey personally washeartfelt and total - so much so that it seemed to go beyond loyalty to a sortof self-denial. To me hecommented:May I say that the contributions you have made to the growth of the Church ofSatan have indeedhumbled me and relegated my own meager efforts to insignificance. I very muchlook forward to workingwith you in the advancement of our mutual cause. 161Janet and I looked at each other in some surprise, since by December 1970 West’sGrotto membershipcame from all of Michigan, portions of Ohio, and locales as far away asOklahoma.162 I responded:If I may say so, you certainly have no right to regard your works asinsignificant! Your dedication andpersonal accomplishments are among the most highly reputed in the Church, andyou have set a newstandard for the image of our Brotherhood. In your past successes you have ourwarmest congratulations; inthe future our confidence and encouragement. 163He replied:The semantic intent attached to my statement anent my “insignificant” and“meager” contributions tothe Church was meant simply to point out my avowed ambition to contribute evenmore substantially to thedissemination of Satanic wisdom throughout the country, and is assuredly not tobe construed as being self-deprecating. I sometimes feel very much inclined to agree with the eminentGeorge Bernard Shaw’sstatement that “England and the United States are the only two countries in theworld which are divided bya common language barrier”. Be that as it may, I am intensely proud of myassociation with the Church andshall do whatever I am able to further its causes. 164Janet was not convinced that West’s understanding of Satanism had gone beyondanti-Christianity. Shesuspected that he saw the Church of Satan as a sort of “Devil’s catholicism”after the Dennis Wheatleyprescription. She voiced her concern in a letter to the Cloven Hoof. “Pleaseread it carefully,” said theHoof, “and then reread it”:Since I joined the Church of Satan two years ago, it has become evident to methat some of ourmembers have a tendency simply to exchange godheads (Satan for God) while stillholding fast to theirprevious, Christian methods of worship. I regard this practice as not onlywasteful but potentiallydangerous. If this godhead should ever become a purely semantic distinction, ourtrue goal will dissolve.I contend that Satan should be regarded as the human ego raised to infiniteperfection. As Satanists weshould consider Satan and his hierarchy as beings who epitomize all the humanemotions, both carnal andspiritual. They are, in other words, thoroughly aware of our human situation andtherefore exhibit empathyfor our various predicaments. Satan deserves scholarship, not worship.The Christian god cannot display any human characteristics, since its station isimpossible for anyhuman to attain, no matter how angelic he happens to be in this life. Itsfollowers cannot question but, like161 Letter, Wayne West to M.A. Aquino, December 10, V/1970.162 Ibid.163 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Wayne West, December 15, V/1970.164 Letter, Wayne West to M.A. Aquino, December 27, V/1970.- 91 -sheep, are led to the slaughter. They must regard it as supreme in all matters.Faith and humility are favoredrather than empiricism and pride.No true Satanist can regard himself as “insignificant” or “meager”. Those areChristian sentiments andhave no place in a diabolical vocabulary. Neither self-depreciation norself-abasement compliments theindividual or Satan.Satan cannot be misrepresented with a God-like image. If this situation occurs,he will be forced to takehis place beside God and spend eternity enveloped in adulation. Satan will loseall relevance to the humanequation - that precise question which distinguishes him from God in the firstplace. The truth is that we arethe only dynamic intellects in this sadly-misled, guilt-ridden population. Satanis glorified within us and byour actions. To worship him would only handicap such magical abilities as we arecapable of possessing. 165Wayne West’s thoughtful response was forthcoming in the next issue of the Hoof:The question of Satan as a godhead has many ramifications which are not easilyresolved. As Satanistswe recognize the Prince of Darkness as the symbolic godhead of our beliefs, atthe same time recognizingourselves as the absolute god. Such an admission, therefore, necessarily entailssymbolic worship of Satanas that guiding force which impels this very attitude of godliness. Neithercould we call upon the Dæmonsof the Pit or the various gods and goddesses of old without at leastacknowledging the existence of the non-anthropomorphic Satanic deity. It must always be remembered, however, that inworshipping the King ofthe Infernal Realm we are but worshipping ourselves and are merely drawing uponthe Satanic inspirationwhich gives direction to our newly acquired liberation.Satan must therefore be given a unique position of eminence quite unlike that ofthe Christian god andrather more akin to that of the gods of yesteryear. Since most of these deitiespossessed human qualities,they were far more compatible with humankind. Yet each was worshipped accordingto the specific needs ofthe individual. The question of faith and humility, then, is even more importantto the Satanist than to theChristian. It is this faith and humility which constitute a partial makeup ofthe magician’s ability to performmagical operations. Such emotions, however, take away nothing from his empiricaland prideful nature. TheSatanist is the god of his own creation and therefore utilizes all aspects ofthe emotional scale to hisparticular advantage.166To West I wrote:Both Jan and I were pleasantly surprised by this latest Hoof. It seems that herletter was quite successfulin goading a few individuals to consider the overall question as an issue worthyof resolution. I note aninclination on the part of one or two of the other commentators, however, toconfuse the actual existence ofthe Dæmonocracy with the ideal approach of the Church of Satan towards it. Theimplications that arisefrom this may be quite serious, and I anticipate responding directly to thisquestion. I think we’re on theway to synthesizing a very powerful and enduring base for the Church - and onewhich will merit thededication and effort which Dr. LaVey has already devoted to its institution.167Here again surfaced the central issue of the Church of Satan: Did the existenceof the isolate humanintellect necessitate Satan’s existence as the source of that intellectualseparateness? Or would the notionof such a literal source somehow negate or restrict the dignity or freedom ofthat intellect? Could theSatanist deny divine influence in his life and yet, through Initiation, come toknow not merely his ownhigher self, but the source which makes all such Initiation, all suchself-ennobling possible? AleisterCrowley, whose writings abound with his knowledge of, faith in, andunderstanding of his own higher self165 Aquino, Janet, letter in Cloven Hoof, January VI/1971, page #10.166 West, Wayne, “Satan as a (Symbolic) Godhead” in Cloven Hoof, FebruaryVI/1971, pages #7-8.167 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Wayne West, February 8, VI/1971.- 92 -(“Holy Guardian Angel” = Aiwass) and of the source of Aiwass’ self-awareness andpower (Horus), hadhis moments of uncertainty and materialism too. In his Magical Record hereflected:All gods are protective phantasies born of the sense of inferiority, either toNature’s power or that ofother men; Freud showed this well enough. They are for use, too, like thebearskin and the war-whoop; theymake me more confident and may frighten the other man. They are the Big Brotherto whom the boythreatens to complain when he is kicked or has his marbles taken. They are intheir maker’s image becauseman can’t create, but only combine, exaggerate, and so on. 168Descartes had once attempted to prove his own existence by the famous syllogism:“Cogito, ergo sum/I think, therefore I am.” But it seemed to me that the syllogism might beexpanded: Cogito, ergo Satanasest. To explore this impression, I wrote an essay for the Cloven Hoof entitled“Beyond theAbyss” (Appendix #22).168 Crowley, Aleister (Symonds & Grant Ed.), The Magical Record of the Beast666. Montreal: Next Step Publications, 1971, pages #180-181.[index-93_1.jpg]- 93 -A woman is beautiful to look upon, contaminating to the touch, and deadly tokeep - a foe to friendship,a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a domestic danger, an evil of naturepainted with fair colors, a liar bynature who seethes with anger and impatience in her whole soul. Since women arefeeble both in mind andin body, it is not surprising that they should come under the spell ofwitchcraft. A woman is more carnalthan a man. All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable.Witches satisfy their filthylusts not only in themselves but even in the mighty ones of the age, of whateversort and condition, causingby all sorts of witchcraft the death of their souls through the excessiveinfatuation of carnal love.Sprenger and KramerMalleus Maleficarum, 1486Early in the year 1971 (VI A.S.) Anton LaVey’s second book was published, thistime in hardcover byDodd, Mead. Its name was The Compleat Witch, or What to do when Virtue Fails.Satanists expecting “more of the Satanic Bible” were surprised, because theCompleat Witch is almostcompletely devoid of ceremonial magical jargon. It is rather a woman’s guide tosuccessful man-catching,characterized by an emphasis on soft-core pornographic techniques and based uponthe presumption thatevery man is a creature of fetishes. All the witch need do, suggests Anton, isdiscover and play to thosefetishes [if she wants to attract or control a man] or against them [if shewants to repulse him].The book is less offensive than it might otherwise be by virtue [or vice] ofAnton’s impudent anddisarming sense of humor. He cuts across almost every conceivable line of “highfashion” and courtshipetiquette, advising women that their sexual appeal to men is largely, if notentirely an animalcharacteristic. Consequently their plan of attack should be as animalistic aspossible.Why the emphasis on man-catching? As Anton puts it in his prologue, it isbecause anything a woman"},{"pageContent":"wants in life is obtained easier through control of men than through otherwomen. Straightforwardenough, save that the book assumes that men can be controlled to a great extentby feminine charm andtheir fetishistic weaknesses. This is a view which is debatable, since sex isonly one of a number of factorswhich influence - but do not necessarily determine - men’s behavior. It is alsothe case that if a manperceives a woman’s approach in terms of a fetish of his, then he may be all themore inclined to considerher significant only insofar as she satisfies that fetish - as is the case whenhe seeks out an athlete fortennis, a musician for piano lessons, or a prostitute for unentangling sex.As a general response to the Compleat Witch’s basic theme, then, I would thinkthat a woman is askingfor disappointment and disillusionment if she tries to present any artificial ordisproportionate image ofher personality to anyone with whom she seeks anything more than a momentarydialogue (such as abusiness deal or one-night fling). She will find it increasingly hard tomaintain the mask as time passes,and to the extent that she succeeds in maintaining it she will be frustrated andtired at having to repress hertrue self. She will come to resent the man for not being attracted to “all ofher”, and her deception willprevent him from either understanding her unhappiness or trying to eliminate thecause of it. More than- 94 -that, he may very well resent learning that she was deliberately deceiving himand thus end the affair ormarriage - even if he might otherwise have been attracted to her truepersonality.Hence at its outset The Compleat Witch is an argument for artificiality, and inthis is one of itsAchilles’ heels. What makes the approach of the book attractive and convincingat first reading is thatthere is in fact a good deal of “amateur” artificiality and deception in humanrelationships as they alreadyexist … accounting, I presume, for many of the failures of such relationships.What The Compleat Witchdoes is raise the technique from “amateur” to “professional” level; Anton citesprofessional manipulatorssuch as carnival operators, film stars, and prostitutes as wise in the ways ofthis particular “witchcraft”.As an aid in simplifying analysis of the intended victim, Anton offers his“LaVey personalitysynthesizer”: a wheel or “clock” placing men at or between four generalstereotypes:12 o’clock: (fire) The man of action, whose attributes are those of authority,aggression, and domination -the most masculine extreme. Color: Red.3 o’clock: (air) The intellectual man, who is more abstract, critical, andtechnical in his interests. Color:Blue.6 o’clock: (water) The passive man, characterized by generosity, dependability,and consistency - the mostfeminine extreme. Color: Green.9 o’clock: (earth) The emotional man, identified by his sociable nature, senseof humor, practicality, andemphasis on doing rather than thinking. Color: Yellow.The first step in using the synthesizer is to pinpoint a given man on the clock.To attract that man, thewoman is advised to personify diametrically opposite features on the clock.Hence The Compleat Witchrestates the notion that opposites attract - with one modification: Antonpostulates the existence of a “coreself” which is more attracted to similarity than to opposition. The result is aparadox in which anindividual consciously desires a mate with similar qualities but actuallyattracts - and would probably bemost content with - a mate of opposite qualities.Application of the synthesizer and the notion of a three-layered, alternatingself yields some intriguingand not-unconvincing hypotheses. The 12 o’clock aggressive male is now shown tobe seeking a womanto dominate him - or rather to dominate his 6 o’clock female demonic self. But awoman who attemptssuch domination must keep it in the realm of emotional game-playing, for if theman ever senses that ithas gone beyond that, his 12 o’clock core self will emerge and reject the woman.Even more confusingly, the type of woman most disposed to answer our male’sdemonic need fordomination would be a 12 o’clock herself. But she would be acceptable to themale only during the“surfacing” of his demonic self. Otherwise his surface/apparent self and hiscore self would reject her -since they desire a 6 o’clock woman! [The 12 o’clock woman’s demonic self is a 6o’clock man.]What to do when (a) it is difficult to stereotype any man on the clock in thefirst place, (b) the woman’s“attractive opposite” approach may be thwarted by the reaction of the man’sdemonic self, (c) thewoman’s demonic self is repelled by the surface and core man, (d) one or bothindividuals may besexually immature, and/or (e) one or both individuals may be homosexual orbisexual, thus turning thepersonality synthesizer from a clock into a roulette wheel?This is the problem that emerges from the system, and The Compleat Witch doesnot really resolve it.Presumably the book’s contribution is simply to expose these stereotypical andopposite-attracting factorsto the light of realization and understanding. But having done so, it does notchart a “best” path throughthem. The would-be witch is simply admonished to adjust aspects of herappearance and behavior toappeal to either the surface or the demonic male, depending upon whether sheseeks a “surface/core” or“demonic” relationship. This is reasonable enough, but it does not address theaforementioned problem.Leaving the synthesizer, Anton discourses on the personality implications of:names [“‘Michael’ isserious and romantic”], automobiles [mechanical mistresses which wise womenshould complement, notcompete with], sleep patterns [dominant individuals sleep on the right side],and sexual fetishes [all menhave fetishes to be discovered and used].- 95 -The various senses of the body give clues to disposition and interests which aCompleat Witch mayuse. Enlarged pupils indicate interest or arousal, as does a glance focuseddirectly on the recipient.Strident, ethereal, soothing, or entertaining music suggests 12/3/6/9clock-position personalities, as dorugged, natural, smooth, or sweet foods. Even sneezing is a personality cue:masculine types snort loudlyand actively, while feminine dispositions try to contain their sneezes. Whileeach sex may dislike its ownnatural odors, the opposite sex will find them - or perfumes suggestive of them- attractive. While there areno true love- or sex-potions available or usable, alcohol can be used - openlyor in disguise - to lower theinhibitions of a chosen victim.When considering such factors as dress, makeup, and hair color, suggests Anton,it is important toconsider not merely the synthesizer’s guidelines but also the “law of theforbidden”. This is the principlethat one will be most interested in something which one is not supposed to see.Thus a man in a burlesquehouse, for example, would be more fascinated by a glimpse of thigh of a femalepatron at a neighboringtable than by the complete and intentional nudity of the professional dancers onstage.The Compleat Witch has harsh words for the fashion industry, suggesting that itsmotive is notenhancement of feminine beauty but rather change of style that is both frequentand radical enough toforce continuous purchases by women who already have closets full of clothes.Moreover, suggests Anton,much “fashionable” attire seems to be designed according to concave orstraight-line patterns whichconflict with the convex, curvilinear female body. Designers of suchunflattering styles, he continues, alsouse attention-getting designs and/or color combinations which call attention tothe dress itself and are notdesigned to enhance the beauty of the person inside the dress. Both clothes andjewelry, he stresses, shouldcomplement the wearer - not themselves.Pantyhose also fall victim to the LaVey wrath; they are seen as a defeminizingalternative to the far-sexier nylons & garter-belt combination. So much emphasis is accorded thispoint, indeed, that a readermay well suspect that Anton has revealed one of his principal fetishes.High-heeled (3-inches) shoes are favored - for an interesting reason: Women whowalk in such shoesare compelled by the angle of their feet to swing their hips and posterior forbalance and comfort, and suchmotion is a feast for the eyes of onlooking males.As he turns to the topic of behavior, Anton has some interesting commentsconcerning the art of lying.There are two kinds of lies, he proposes: the kind that listeners want to hearand the kind that the liar usesfor purely selfish gain. The former can be used wisely and prudently, but thelatter rarely benefits the liarin the long run because sooner or later the truth will out. Anton concludes:Lie and give pleasure. Lie and soothe consciences. Lie and supply the food forthe ego that the truth canseldom provide. Lie and become a hero, for whatever lies are popular will alwayswin votes. Lie, but be notyourself deluded by your lies, lest you lose control, for he who loses controlover his own motivations cannever progress to a proficiency in sorcery.169A Compleat Witch who has her eye on a married man is advised to present herselfas an attractionsimilar to but more intriguing than his wife. If he happens to be happilymarried, the best the newcomershould anticipate is a temporary affair, because the husband’s loyalty and guiltwill more than likelyovercome a sexual temptation in the long run. Moreover, adds Anton, the CompleatWitch has certainbasic forces of social ethics working against her if she takes the initiative tointrude upon a happymarriage. Even if her machinations succeed in destroying said marriage, theex-husband will probably notwant her as a new mate; his guilt and will impel him towards a liaison throughwhich he can forget, notrelive the disruption.Homosexual men can be used by the Compleat Witch who appeals to them on a purelyPlatonic basis,but their commitment to their homosexuality requires so fundamental a decisionon their part that attempts169 LaVey, Anton, The Compleat Witch. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1970, page #199.- 96 -to coax them back to heterosexuality are probably doomed to failure. The lesbianCompleat Witch,however, can victimize men as well as her heterosexual counterpart - better, insome ways, because she isfree from emotional entanglement herself. Of course if her lesbianism isevident, cautions Anton, sheshould presume that her attraction to men will probably be to their demonic self- which will either relishthe opportunity for a forceable conquest or be seeking whip-mistress domination.Finally The Compleat Witch offers advice concerning more traditional kinds ofmagic. Astrology isdebunked through an adapted version of Anton’s earlier handout on the subject(Appendix #18).Prediction and fortune-telling are treated as “Mitt Camp” trickeries to flatter,intimidate, or otherwisecontrol the gullible. Compleat Witches are rather encouraged towards rituals tobolster their sexual self-esteem and/or to reinforce their hatred and scorn of enemies or rivals.Examples of both types of ritual are given. A woman wishing to enhance herprojection of sexualityand vulnerability is advised to take a stroll through public places moststimulating to her - naked under acoat. To attack enemies she may either build and destroy a traditional Voodoodoll or bake and devour agingerbread figure of the individual in question. During the hours of darkness -when most persons areasleep and their minds are most vulnerable - the Compleat Witch may cast herimage into a man’s dreamsas a medieval succubus might have done.Anton describes pets as representing either the demonic or the core self; avisual comparison of petand owner is usually sufficient to determine whether there is core similarity ordemonic compensation. If apet appears demonic, the owner will probably not like a visitor’s attentions toit. If it is core, however,such attentions will be welcomed.Anton’s closing admonition is cryptic and inconclusive:You can’t erase millions of years of human response simply by knowing why you dothe things you do.Not if they concern the Rules of the Chase. Religions and ideologies will comeand go, and the Games willbegin and end, but man’s basic nature will remain the same. Yet only throughunderstanding himself will hebe able to embrace and cherish the demon within him. Then he can revel in hisnature and, feeling glad,move on to the Final Solution. 170What are we to make of The Compleat Witch? What are we to make of someone whowould authorsuch a treatise?The most commendable feature of the book is that it subjects unconscious andinstinctive humanmannerisms to the spotlight of logical analysis. It tells you, in Anton’s words,“why you do the things youdo” - at least in terms of sexual interactions. Despite some obviousoversimplification, most if not all ofThe Compleat Witch’s observations are accurate to the point of embarrassment.The unprepared reader,whether male or female, generally reacts with a mixture of wonder, defensivelaughter, and self-consciousindignation.If the book’s recommendations are not accepted and utilized - and by and largethey have not been, ifthe publishing history of the book is any guide - it is perhaps because TheCompleat Witch goes too far. Itshatters one’s cherished personal fantasies at the same time that it destroysthe conniving projections ofothers. It may be seen by the reader as a device to destroy the consciouspersonality, although it would bemore accurate to describe it as destroying that reader’s artificial illusion ofconscious personality.In the human psyche there is no clear dividing line between the rational selfand this superstructure ofillusion, rationalization, superstition, and general self-deceit. Thus an attackon the superstructure alsoseems to damage many of the most noble virtues of the soul - among them love,friendship, admiration,respect, sympathy, and above all a sense of one’s own dignity and nobility as abeing. The Compleat Witchimplies, if not dictates that these are foolish conceits.170 Ibid. , page #266.- 97 -And so, through a mixture of genuine intellectual rejection and animalisticantagonism at being “foundout”, one rejects the book. Despite a nationwide promotional trip by itscharismatic author, The CompleatWitch faded from bookstores within its first year, the initial hardcoverprinting unexhausted. A paperbackedition later made a similarly brief and abortive appearance.171 Anton bought upthe remaining hardcovercopies and marketed them through the Church of Satan via a flier (Appendix #23).In Chapter #2 I speculated that Anton LaVey, despite his professed image asSvengali and 12 o’clockmacho-man, is actually wary of women and uncomfortable with those who do not apriori acknowledgethe slave-collar of sexuality above and beyond their intellect. Does TheCompleat Witch substantiate this?I think so. But the more profound issue is: Is the intellect of woman in factdominated by conscious andunconscious sexuality? If men are either comparatively or wholly free fromsimilar sexual domination[and this may be nothing more than a reassuring male illusion], do women resenttheir own seeminglyexcessive sexuality, hate themselves for it, and lash out at men for being freeof it?Such questions are so sensitive that, like those involving racial equality, theyare virtually taboo.Sloganistic affirmations of equality are fine, but even asking the questions insuch a context thatunflattering conclusions are possible is liable to win the enquirer a suit oftar and feathers.In such a social atmosphere Anton LaVey necessarily found himself on the hornsof a dilemma. If headdressed such sensitive taboos cold-bloodedly, he might seriously antagonizecorresponding activist andextremist groups - upon many of which he had already come to depend for tacitsupport of his initialattack on organized religion and outmoded social customs.The Satanic Bible’s success can be attributed in part to its subjectivity; eachreader can assume that itis attacking the conventions he or she dislikes. As for organized religion ingeneral and Christianity inparticular, it has not been a “taboo” question in Western culture since theEnlightenment and theconsequent onset of materialism. This is not to say that a number of people didnot take offense at theespousal of Satanism, but it is to say that they were and are obviously from thefanatic fringes of societyinstead of the social mainstream. Were this not the case, creation and operationof the Church of Satanwould have been too dangerous to be seriously considered by Anton LaVey oranyone else.The Compleat Witch, then, was a testing of the waters of the social mainstream.It was explicit wherethe Satanic Bible had been vague, and it approached the periphery of amainstream social taboo. Antonsurvived its appearance by (a) the tongue-in-cheek “safety valve” of hishumorous writing style and (b) hisfocus on women’s capitalization upon their disproportionate sexuality (which isan unspokenpresupposition of the book).So while the book ostensibly flatters and encourages women, it also “humiliates”them by its veryexistence. This humiliation is sensed, with the result that women findthemselves irritated by the bookalmost without knowing why it affects them that way.Hence Anton’s wariness of women cannot be cited as sexual maladjustment on hispart. As long as theentire subject of sexual equality remains under taboo, any judgment on thesubject is simply premature. IfAnton chose to surround himself with women who would accept the collar of femaleinferiority, it isunsurprising that he would offer them a blueprint for making the most of theirweakness.And his final disclaimer of invulnerability is thus mere rhetoric: He has madethe rules of the “Game”,and he has admitted to the Game only those who agree to play by those rules. “A12 o’clock,” he writes,“cannot stand to lose. For this reason the 12 o’clock is the one least likely toengage in any sort ofcompetitive sport. If he can be the sole or stellar performer, however, heexcels.” 172Here too, perhaps, we approach the answer to another question which wasoccasionally asked inpassing when The Compleat Witch first appeared: Why not a Compleat Warlock formales, or even aCompleat Satanist spotlighting both sexes?171 LaVey, Anton, Compleat Witch handout, XII/1977.172 LaVey, Anton, The Compleat Witch, pages #48-49.- 98 -If the unspoken assumption of The Compleat Witch is that women are weaker thanmen because theyare the slaves of their sexuality, then the corresponding assumption concerningmen is that they areemotionally stronger and more free because they are not so enslaved. Men like tothink of themselves asfree intellects who can dabble in sex as the mood strikes them but who can justas easily ignore it whenthere are more important things to do. [The classic caricature of this, ofcourse, is James Bond, whorepeatedly demonstrates his own strength in this way as he conquers even the“strongest” women, thusproving to the Pussy Galores that they are doomed to sexual slavery no matterhow much they maystruggle against it. Unconquerable women in Bond novels - such as the man-hatingTilly Masterson inGoldfinger - are portrayed unfavorably and usually killed off quickly.]What sort of reception, therefore, would there be for a Compleat Warlock thateven vaguely challengesthe James Bond male standard? Not much. It might be read with avowed interest bythe relatively smallcross-section of men and women who admit and understand the bisexual structureof all personalities, butotherwise its rejection would be, if anything, far more complete and emphaticthan that of The CompleatWitch.And Anton LaVey, who places himself firmly at 12 o’clock, would probably beamong the first toreject such a Compleat Warlock. His own personality synthesizer suggests why:The man whose surfaceand core selves are the most precisely 12 o’clock is the same one whose demonicself is equally precisely6 o’clock. As these are masculine and feminine extremes, the tension betweenthem is tremendous, andonly a constant effort on the part of the surface and core selves is sufficientto repress the demonic. As thesurface/core self departs from the sexual extreme towards 3 or 9 o’clock, ofcourse, so does the demonic.Theoretically there is a minimum of sexual tension at a 3/9 juxtaposition,because the conflicts there arethose of mental vs. physical activity, etc.The demonic self, says The Compleat Witch, may be satisfied either by allowingit to surfaceperiodically or by selecting a mate to symbolize or sublimate it. The CompleatWitch is admonishedaccordingly concerning a male target: “This means that you can approach him asan “outsider” who willtreat him in the manner that his Minority (demonic) Self craves, or you can behis Minority Self, in afemale form.” 173In a relationship between a 12 o’clock man and a 6 o’clock woman, therefore,there would besubsurface tension in both parties which could be released by the woman beingdominant and the mansubmissive in the extreme. The alternative to this is constant projection ofone’s own demonic on to theother individual. If successfully done, attraction results.Here is an interesting hypothesis concerning attraction and/or love: If allhuman beings arenarcissistic, is seemingly “selfless” love for another more precisely the lovefor one’s demonic selfprojected on to another? This is the theory espoused by The Compleat Witch. Itis instantly repugnant tothe romantic mind, of course, but to some extent it is already awell-established psychological principle.If the demonic is indulged by periodically allowing it to surface, the reliefwould probably be greaterthan that achieved through projection or other sublimation. On the other hand,such a release would behighly repugnant to the surface/core selves of both individuals - resulting intheir continuing frustrationand general unhappiness. [This “demonic surfacing” is presumably the basis forsuch sexual phenomenaas sadomasochism, transvestitism, and - in its most extreme and psychotic form -lycanthropy. See mycomment in Chapter #6.]The Pandora’s Jar of The Compleat Witch is therefore a deep one, containing manyhorrors and truthsbeyond those which appear on the surface. It is perhaps merciful that the boxwas slammed shut as soon asit was; humankind is yet too fragile to confront its entire range of contents.One of the least advertised, most intriguing, and most revealing sections of TheCompleat Witch is itseight-page bibliography. In truth it is more a card catalogue of the tomesdisplayed in 6114’s Purple Roomthan a source document for The Compleat Witch. Hence it offers a rare glimpseinto the Lesser Magical173 Ibid., page #24.- 99 -mind of Anton LaVey - the mind that seeks to understand, glorify, and controlcarnal, animalistic mankind.Here are no works by Milton or Baudelaire; here is rather the MetropolitanLibrary in the City of DreadfulNight.The books comprising this bibliography are listed in Appendix #24. Although thereader’s initialreaction will probably be that this literary rogues’ gallery is merely good fora frown or a chuckle, I cannotoverstress the bibliography’s actual significance. The magician who takes theinitiative to seek out,acquire, read, and apply the principles expounded here will find that anentirely new, potent, and evenwondrous perspective on the human condition will gradually unveil itself.It is a mistake to think that humanity’s high intelligence capacity manifestsitself only in the quest forenlightenment. In fact such striving is rare, difficult, and discouraginglysubjective. But, to expand and de-sexize the quotation from Sprenger and Kramer, the minds of both men and womenseethe and boil withinstinctive, semiconscious, and emotional actions and reactions to the millionsof external stimuli andinternal genetic urges that constantly assail them. [Plato referred to suchanimal existence as Eikasia(imagining), with dogmatic, pseudo-thinking occurring as a superstructure calledPistis (believing).]Against such a “dragon” the mind’s self-consciousness, morality, and philosophycan make only themost limited attacks; this is particularly so in the non-initiated mind, whichis rarely aware of the truenature of the struggle and is merely under the impression that it isoccasionally thinking objectively andrationally (the level of thought which Plato called Dianoia).Viewed in this context, initiation may be likened to a bucket of cold waterthrown over the raging fireof natural existence. The fire will flare up again, of course, but now the Adepthas had at least amomentary glimpse of higher existence and perspective (Plato’s nœsis). Assumingthat he finds thatexperience stimulating and ennobling, the initiated state will be pursued - andstrengthened as higherstates are attained.Such initiatory effort, unfortunately, does not slay the dragon of Eikasia.Paradoxically it strengthensit along with the enlightened mind. This has been the theme of many stories suchas Stevenson’s Dr. Jekylland Mr. Hyde, and it was brought to the screen most dramatically in a 1956motion picture entitledForbidden Planet.In Forbidden Planet the scientist Dr. Morbius, exploring the planet of Altair-4,finds that theseemingly highly-advanced natives (the “Krel”) were ultimately exterminated bysome unknown force.After undergoing artificial expansion of his own intelligence via one of theKrel machines, the bewilderedMorbius sees the other members of his exploration team horribly slain one byone. The murderer isinvisible; only for a moment are its outlines traced in a blaze of gunfire fromthe starship sent to rescue thestranded scientist. Finally Morbius learns that his own Id - the strengthenedEikasia of his own mind - isthe murderer. He can only destroy it by destroying himself as the Krel didbefore him.It is precisely this simultaneous strengthening of the complete intellect thatconstitutes the greatest andmost unsuspected danger to the initiate, as often as not resulting - as with theKrel and Dr. Morbius - inintolerable tension and eventual self-destruction. Dr. Francis I. Regardieremarked to me:Concerning your speculation as to whether Nietzsche was a genius or a madman: AsI see it, that is notthe issue. So far as I know, Nietzsche suffered from general paresis. Whateverpsychotic symptoms wentalong with general paresis are dependent upon the pre-psychotic personality hehad. If he were a depressive,the paretic symptoms would be depressive; if schizophrenic, then schizophrenic,etc. What we do know ofhim can be described as an inability to reconcile the Apollonian and Dionysianelements within himself sothat, even without paresis, he could have succumbed under internal pressure to awhole host of psychicdisturbances. Some form of psychotherapy, undertaken early enough in his life,might have saved him fromthat.Much the same is true of Aleister Crowley, though I cannot see that either ofthem would havevolunteered entering therapy. The therapy of choice, as I see things now, isstill Reichian therapy. Diagnosisof whatever one is plays a secondary role in that scheme of things. The therapyadapts itself to the personinvolved and is not directed towards adapting the person to the standards ofconventional society, but- 100 -towards getting rid of any factor which prevents him from fulfilling his ownpotential. This, of course, iswhere it links up with Magic. In fact they fit hand in glove.Magic, generally speaking, still does not recognize the ego-inflationary aspectof its own system -which is why there are so many casualties. If it would incorporate Reichiantherapy into itself and make it apart of Magic, then it would have some kind of objective system to correct itsways and prevent its studentsfrom fouling up their own nests. Mere education in the phenomenon is no answerto this problem. FraterAchad, theoretically, was educated in the notion of “destroying the ego” bycrossing the Abyss, so-called,but it did not save him from inflationary activities of the ego such asasserting the equivalence of his owngrade of Neophyte (1)=[10] with the supernal grade of Ipsissimus (10)=[1]. Thisis asinine from theordinary point of view and doesn’t make sense. It only becomes intelligible fromthe viewpoint that the veryprocess of Magic puffs up the ego. This may be desirable up to a certain point.But this is where a damnedgood guru is absolutely essential, so that the necessary psycho-spiritualcorrective processes can be set intomotion. 174The bibliography of The Compleat Witch - the non-initiatory library of AntonSzandor LaVey - is aportrait of the dragon of humanity’s bestial subconscious. It is a blueprint ofPlato’s Eikasia. It is the Id-monster of Forbidden Planet illuminated by spaceship gunfire. And it is a damnedgood guru.In XXIV/1989 The Compleat Witch was reissued in paperback by Feral Press underthe title TheSatanic Witch. While the text is unchanged in this edition, an introduction byZeena LaVey and an “Aboutthe Author” postscript by “Blanche Barton” [see Appendix #145] have been added.[Because of thewriting style, tone, and topic/period references, my guess is that the “Barton”postscript was extensivelyedited, if not ghost-written entirely by Anton himself. I would assign it thesame questionable credibilityas The Devil’s Avenger and Secret Life of a Satanist.]The only other alteration made by Anton in the 1989 edition is in the deletionof his original 1971dedication. As I think that it should properly remain with the book, I reproduceit here:To my two favorite witches - my daughters Karla and Zeena, my wife and HighPriestess Diane, and toall the witches - compleat and incompleat - who, by their lives and antics, madethis book possible.174 Letter, Francis I.

Our Game is about to continue. It seems the span ofmoments since the Gamebegan in 1966 of the common era. Stand proudly, ye Children of Satan! All hailthe Year Six!175Thus did Anton LaVey proclaim the Satanic Year Six (1972 CE) in the Cloven Hoof.Anton’s optimismappeared very well founded. After five years of existence as a largely SanFrancisco phenomenon, theChurch of Satan was beginning to reach out across the United States. Membership- both in the fourGrottos and at-large - was well over 100 and was spread throughout almost everystate in the country, aswell as Canada, Mexico, and Australia.176 Sales of the Satanic Bible weresoaring, and there was everyreason to presume that the Compleat Witch would follow suit.In Kentucky the Nineveh Grotto, now twenty strong, was meeting weekly at theLouisville colonialhouse to which Janet and I had moved - not because Brandenburg had provedinhospitable, but simplybecause we needed more space … and a touch more cosmopolitan culture thanBrandenburg could offer.We acquired a black Persian cat named Nefertum (the Egyptian lion-god, son ofPtah and Sekhmet andconsidered Khem’s counterpart to the Greek Prometheus) and then a raccoon namedJesus Christ. Jesustook up residence under the Grotto altar, from which He ventured forth at nightto explore and generallyransack the house, ceasing only when an irate Satanic Priest would grab Him byHis ringed tail and pullHim forcibly from His current enterprise.Retrieving the ribbon for my typewriter from Jesus’ hoard, I sent a letter toArthur Lyons, I° from PalmSprings, whose The Second Coming: Satanism in America had been published in late1970. It was anobjective, comprehensive, and readable history of Satanism from antiquity to thepresent. For example:Satan did not die with the advent of rationalism, for the need for him was notrational. His presence hasbeen doubted only because Western man, trained from birth to discard and smotherany belief he mighthave in a supernatural realm, extends this field of vision to any of thosepeople he might encounter that dobelieve. One must not necessarily postulate the existence of a supernaturalrealm, however, to acknowledgethe existence of a hard-core, fanatical group that does. The reality need onlybe accepted that the group175 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, January VI/1971, page #17.176 Inter-Communication Roster in Cloven Hoof ca. January VI/1971, showingrepresentative size and geographic distribution of membership.- 102 -believes, for the group is the force motivated toward action. An atheist mightas well attempt to deny theexistence of the Catholic Church simply because he himself does not believe inGod. In each case, however,the man must adjust his outlook and his behavior to the real external situationif he wants to continue hisexistence unimpaired. Man renders himself most defenseless when he refuses tobelieve, when he crippleshimself with a self-inflicted ignorance.177Lyons concluded with a thoughtful analysis of the Church of Satan’s profilr. Iwrote him accordingly:At present there is a sharp distinction drawn between the mechanics oforganization and philosophy.Rituals, meetings, and individual commentaries may take any point of viewwithout encountering censureof any sort. The management of membership records, finances, and policies,however, is centralized in theoffice of the High Priest. This is the most efficient way to run anyorganization, but, as was the case with theold monarchies, the Church will stand or fall on the strength of the HighPriest. The alternative to this is theinstitution of bureaucracy, a corporate governing structure which would continueto function independent ofany one individual.The dangers of bureaucracy, in my opinion, far outweigh its advantages.Parkinson’s Law is a valid one- that any bureaucracy’s first concern is self-perpetuation. Both pressingquestions and insignificanttechnicalities are subject to being staffed to death, with the result thatinertia sets in. Finally change andevolution become a practical impossibility [witness the Vatican and the pill],and the organization stagnates.It might be added that there is a financial correlation of Parkinson’s Law aswell: that the point at whichadministrative costs skyrocket is the entrenchment of a bureaucracy and itsprojected expense accounts.Accordingly I support most strongly the retention of the existing policy ofcentralized administrationand policy decision. I would oppose any diffusion of the High Priest’s authorityto a collective agency. Farfrom repressing the membership, I contend that this system would be moreconducive to timely action,reaction, and adaptation than a parliamentary alternative.The danger of schism or factionalism is minimized in a monarchic structure;disruptive or anarchicelements can simply be excluded. As long as individuals are informed of therationale behind any givendecision, they are unlikely to harbor feelings of either resentment or distrust.The vulnerable occasions arethose at which power is transferred or a major issue resolved by decree. As anexample of such an issue inthe latent phrase, note that a large percentage of letters to the Cloven Hoofportray Satan as a de facto Godto be served, worshipped, and adored - not as an antigod. For such persons thedistinction betweenChristianity and Satanism is principally semantic. The long-term influence ofsuch a trend could bedisastrous, and I suspect the question may be called shortly. Some people, Isuppose, cannot exist without amaster to serve. Erich Fromm is alive and lurking in the ritual chamber. 178In San Francisco there was no perceived distinction between the Church of Satanand the person ofAnton LaVey. The Church was what he said it was, with the Council of Nineserving as an implementationdevice and general sounding-board. There were no activities apart from those athis home, and there wereno organizational or policy documents other than those he had written. 2,000miles away in Louisville Ifound that we would have to create and operate a Church of Satan of our own -bound to 6114 by theideas, not by the person of Anton LaVey. The Nineveh Grotto perceived the Churchnot as anorganizational reflection of him, but rather as an organization unified bycertain ideas and in which he heldthe founding and chief executive office.This notion was not unique to Nineveh; it characterized the general attitude ofall non-San FranciscoSatanists for the next four years. To us it represented a stage of growth forthe Church and thus was a goodsign; Anton himself encouraged it by periodic moves towards decentralization,regionalization, and effortsto create a viable, standardized operating structure for Grottos.177 Lyons, Arthur Jr., The Second Coming: Satanism in America. New York: Dodd,Mead, V/1970, pages #3-4.178 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Arthur Lyons, December 3, V/1970.- 103 -Arthur Lyons’ exposure to the Church had been through visits to 6114. I nowwanted his opinion onthe future of the organization as he had evaluated it in his book. He wroteback:I am in total agreement as to the disadvantages of bureaucracy. Parkinson’s Lawis not only in effect inany bureaucratic structure, but also the Peter Principle. Centralized policy inthe person of the High Priest isabsolutely necessary, particularly considering that it is Anton’s charisma thatis holding the whole showtogether. One of the principal problems will be to ensure a transfer ofauthority after his death, although thateventuality is a long ways away. Probably the best structure to facilitate thiswould be a council of advisorsmodeled after the President’s cabinet, which would forward policy considerationsbut would have noadministrative power. The High Priest could consult with the council whennecessary, but also coulddisregard any suggestions they might have. The council, which could be a bodyrepresented by variousGrotto Leaders across the country, could appoint a new leader after the death ofthe old High Priest, a leaderwho would once again assume the role of independent policy maker. It isnecessary to breed a supply ofvital new leaders who will radiate the charisma necessary to attract and holdnew members. The primaryforce that has led to the spectacular growth of the Church is the personality ofAnton LaVey.As for future structure: Since the cultic response is what has attracted manyconverts to the Church,since the in-group secrecy is what holds great appeal for many who feelthemselves becoming increasinglydepersonalized by a massive, overwhelming social environment, small,semi-clandestine cults would seemto be the most desirable structural unit to ensure future growth. Keeping thegroups tightly shuttered[although this does not necessarily pertain to membership] is important in thatit provides the members witha feeling of personal possession, of having something that is denied tooutsiders. The exclusiveness of theChurch is a factor likely to add greatly to its appeal. Even if it became amajority religion, a prospect veryunlikely to occur, the feeling must be inculcated in the members that they areparticipating in a clandestine,minority religion.For the time being I see little danger from internal corruption due toinfiltrating enemies or of collapsefrom external attack. The more attacks on the Church from without, the greaterthe appeal it will have forthe newly-emerging “counterculture”, which in all probability will be dictatingthe morality of the ’80s. Isee the present period as crucial in the evolution of the Church, however, asfar as publicity goes. I think[and I have let my views be known to Dr. LaVey] that all publicity apart fromthe speaking engagements ofthe High Priest should be halted. That includes all television and motionpicture coverage of rituals andChurch activities. The doors should be closed to peeping toms. The reason forthis is that the news mediahave the tendency to cut and edit film material according to their own tastes;the Church usually comes outon the wrong end. The charisma of the High Priest is enough to attract converts.Added to this is the factthat some of the rituals used in the Church tend to be slightly soporific. Ifthey come off that way when oneattends in person, there can be no doubt that they will emerge that way on film,when narrow-mindededitors get their thrills by cutting and splicing. 179It remains problematical whether Art was overly dubious on the effects of theChurch’s ongoingdialogue with the media. Some of the most objective and insightful coverage wereceived over the years tocome involved officials other than Anton and Grottos far away from SanFrancisco. Correspondingly,some of the worst hatchet jobs [such as Gumaer’s in American Opinion] focused onthe High Priest.The larger issue is whether the sum total of the Church’s ten-year mediaexposure did it or itsmembership any real good - besides padding our egos with “printed pageimportance” and entertaining apublic chiefly interested in titillation and sensationalism: nude altars andlions and, as Diane LaVey put it,“stuffed rats and tombstones”.Certainly the Church obtained more members as a consequence of media exposure,but through itslifetime it also suffered a high rate of membership turnover and a high rate ofcurrent membership apathy -principally because many affiliated casually and without any clear purpose inmind beyond gainingcocktail-party notoriety.179 Letter, Arthur Lyons to M.A. Aquino, December 7, V/1970.- 104 -On the negative side, the generally sensationalistic image of the Churchconveyed by the media provedthe dominant one; and many an honorable, decent, and ethical Satanist hassuffered personal orprofessional discrimination because of tabloid newspaper imagery.As of 1981 - six years after the Church ceased to exist as a functioningorganization - its media legacywas typified by an article in the August 4, 1981 issue of the tabloid newspaperGlobe:JAYNE MANSFIELD SLAIN BY THE DEVIL- Details of Satanic Sacrifice Revealed After 14 Years -JAYNE MANSFIELD LAID OUT NUDE ON THE DEVIL’S ALTAR- Black Pope Warned Her Not To Take The Death Ride -180Lyons’ suggested role for the Council of Nine was very close to the one italready appeared to occupy.There was only one problem, as had been observed and commented upon by RandallAlfred: The Councilhad no actual, legal power:Even in the group’s ruling council I was able to avoid undue influence, since itwas an advisory ratherthan a legislative body. LaVey could and frequently did override the council bymeans of appeals to his owncharismatic authority or to Satanic tradition. 181Alfred also echoed Lyons’ “6114” opinion on the underpinning role of Anton’scharisma:By no means the least of the major elements of attraction to the Church of Satanis the charismaticauthority of the High Priest and Magus of the Black Order, Anton Szandor LaVey.Charismatic authority“rests upon the belief in magical powers, revelations, and hero worship” (Weber,Social Psychology of theWorld Religions). LaVey bases his authority on all three. Most active members ofthe Church acceptLaVey’s magical abilities as demonstrated both by the tales he tells of his ownmagical workings and bywhat he has done for them. As for revelation, he cites his discovery of themagical “Law of the Trapezoid”and refers mysteriously to the “blinding flash” of his own Satanic dawning. 182My own confidence in the leadership of Anton LaVey was based upon (1) his levelof magicalknowledge being far beyond that of any other individual in the Church, (2) hisdemonstrated competencein formulating viable policy for the institution, and (3) a conviction that hewas in fact - through the“blinding flash” of his V° - ordained by Satan to found and guide the Church.One cannot discuss theoffice of the High Priest of Satan in the way one can discuss the selection andduties of a president of aKiwanis club! If the Church were superior to and more enduring than Anton LaVeypersonally, however,sooner or later the problem of legitimizing the High Priesthood would have to befaced. I sai to Lyons:You have hit a very delicate nail very squarely on the head by bringing up thecrucial importance of Dr.LaVey’s charisma and the questions which would arise as a consequence of hisretirement or demise. Theproblem of succession in any monarchy or autocracy is a painful one, the more sosince it seems so ghoulishto consider it in advance. Nevertheless it would be folly to pull an ostrichact, particularly if we areinterested in forging the Church into an institution that will survive not onlyDr. LaVey but Michael Aquinoand Arthur Lyons as well.There is a very great tendency for occult organizations to be perpetuatedprimarily on the basis of heroworship - as is the apparent case with the O.T.O. Two major problems areconsequent to this: First, the180 Globe, August 4, 1981, front cover, pages #3 & #4-5.181 Alfred, op. cit., page #184.182 Ibid., page #191. The Law of the Trapezoid states that all obtuse angles aremagically harmful to those who are not aware of this property.The same angles are beneficial, stimulating, and energizing to those who aremagically sensitive to them.- 105 -organizational philosophy ceases to evolve and eventually stagnates. Second, theimage of the admiredfigure is invariably distorted, representing him to the public as anempire-building egotist. Such a shallowportrait is hardly deserved by Dr. LaVey, but only consider Crowley to see howsuch things develop. 183Lyons and I confessed ourselves at an impasse. We simply didn’t know where toproceed from thispoint, and it seemed vaguely impolite to be speculating so negatively wheneverything was going so well.I think too that we were both conscious that virtually no one else in the Churchshared our interest inorganizational structure; we were beating a horse that had never lived in thefirst place. Today I think it isregrettable that we didn’t press on to try to establish a Church-wide consensuson the subject; many of theproblems that later beset the Church might thus have been avoided or eased.In mid-December V, while piloting my cherished Lotus Elan +2S along theBrandenburg Roadtowards Fort Knox, I was struck head-on by a heavier car which spun out of itslane into mine. Thealuminum and fiberglass Lotus disintegrated, leaving me with a steering wheel,an engine, and two brokenlegs. I was taken to the Fort Knox hospital in Brandenburg’s hearse, the vehiclemost immediatelyavailable. Contemplating the novel picture I would make standing before theGrotto altar on crutches, Iread Anton’s letter of encouragement:I trust that by this time you are well on the road to recovery, despite theaches and pains of the healingprocess. My most profound sympathies are with you, and though the substance ofyour being actuated theSatanic forces towards your somewhat miraculous survival, I am neverthelessangered that such a mishapshould have presented itself. Even though I can rationalize your collision asone of those inevitablehappenings in the proving ground known as “worldly experience”, it lessens notmy concern for yourwelfare. You are far too meaningful in the Plan ahead for anything to deter you.Prevail you must, and Idamn well will see to it. My magic is with you and Janet more than even myclosest associates realize, and Iwork towards your rapid recovery. 184A short time earlier I had sent Anton a copy of Peter Ouspensky’s The Psychologyof Man’s PossibleEvolution, which I thought [and still think] a brilliant, concise, and readabletreatise. Anton commented:I received the Ouspensky volume and wish to thank you for your thoughtfulness inhaving it sent. It is amasterpiece, and you are to be commended for bringing it to my attention. I amgoing to make it requiredreading for all members and will state same in next month’s newsletter. Perhapsit might explain theBalance Factor to a few of our more egocentric members who constantly seek newpower and wouldn’tknow what to do with it if they had it.185Diane LaVey added an observation of her own a few days later:Although I’m not nearly so eloquent as Anton, I do wish to express my sinceresorrow that such amishap had to occur, and I feel highly indignant that you had to put up with allthe discomfort,inconvenience, and material loss (your pretty little Lotus), Michael, and trustyou’re mending rapidly. Antonand I were discussing the probable misconception that it’s never the Earth’sexcess baggage that is subjectto ill luck, but only the worthwhile people. In reality it’s probably just thatthe people with much more tooffer are missed more; so that when they’re down, one tends to notice the voidand therefore recall thoseevents. Those who contribute nothing to the world around them likely have justas much if not more183 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Arthur Lyons, January 25, VI/1971.184 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 18, V/1970.185 Ibid.- 106 -hardship in their lives, but no one remembers it, since their presence isn’tintensely felt even when they’rein the peak of condition. Your vitality is indeed missed and needed, so hurryand get well.186By “worthwhile people” Diane meant what the LaVeys had come to envision as theSatanist in practice- an individualist who asserts a sophisticated life-philosophy politely,prudently, yet uncompromisingly.Anton had come to feel that much of the social antagonism concerning the Churchof Satan derived not asmuch from its theoretical challenge to an outmoded religious system as from themasses’ fear and jealousyof individualism in whatever context. In the January Cloven Hoof he said:Ignorant people are only hurt by the threat that they might not be the same aseveryone else! The onlyreason a good Christian is so smug and obnoxious in his judgment of others isbecause he thinks he is “it”.If something comes along to threaten his security by implying that he (theChristian) is a part of the verything he claims to hate most, the once-smug fellow starts to feel like a pariah.The ignoramus has to be part of his protective herd, or he is powerless. Getenough ignoramusesquestioning their own identity and they’re in real trouble!Satanists who are sincere and dedicated to their religion and who are notbreaking any laws of the landneed fear no actual legal persecution; in fact the Constitution is on our side.It is the persecutor who wouldslander us who is in direct violation of Constitutional rights.The only reason these vermin attempt such slander - and get away with it - isbecause they take it forgranted that Satanists and witches are not practicing a religion. Since therehas never before been anorganized body of Satanists or witches, and the definition of such as been thatof the tormentor, it hasalways been “open season” for witch-hunting. 187The Church of Satan was ready to hear this message. Lilith Sinclair’s letter inthe February Hoof wasrepresentative of membership sentiment:I shall always be grateful to the Church of Satan for enabling me to live as Isee fit, for giving me pridein myself, and for the immense satisfaction in simply being alive that Satanismhas brought me.Before I became a member, I’d always been a Satanist at heart, albeitunknowingly; and for years Iendured the most painful guilt feelings and mental conflict trying to live up tothe rules of the Christiandoctrines. As a child I was taught to accept and believe anything they chose toram down my throat, withoutquestion, simply because they said so and that was that.As I grew older, I began to look around and question the things I saw and heard,and I finally came torealize that I had been used and duped - made to feel “sinful” for nothing morethan being my human self!I say to those white-light religionists that in Satanism I have found a way oflife that makes me glad tobe alive, free from guilt and censure, recognized as having needs and desiresfor which I need not beashamed. I glory in Satanism and in the zest for life it has given me! I hurl mySatanic condemnation atthose hypocritical Christ-followers who perpetrate their heinous philosophy, andto those sheep-like,cowering milksops who follow them blindly I give my unbridled contempt!188Lilith, who by now had decided that she was going to organize another new branchof the Churchrather than remain a member-at-large, was elevated [with special commendation]to Witch II° in February- together with such other rising stars as Joseph Daniels of Indiana, RobertDeCecco of Massachusetts,James and Dolores Stowe of California, Robert Ethel of Washington D.C., BettyeFischer of Florida, and186 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 22, V/1970.187 LaVey, Anton, “Offensive Defense for Satanists” in Cloven Hoof, JanuaryVI/1971, page #3.188 Sinclair, Lilith in Cloven Hoof, February VI/1971, page #11.- 107 -Spencer Waldron of New York. Together with Spencer and advised by Wayne West,Lilith began to talk toprospective members about the formation of a Grotto in New York. 189Louisville had by now awakened to the Satanic goings-on in its midst. A majorpolicy statement on theVietnam War by President Nixon shared page #1 of a February Louisville Timeswith an article onNineveh: “Each Friday a group of Satanists meets here to PAY THE DEVIL HIS DUE”.A few days laterJanet was invited to address an enthusiastic crowd of 100 at the city’s FirstUnitarian Church, and a shorttime after that I lectured on the Devil in English Literature to a combinedclass audience of 200 at a localhigh school [with some surprise, I’ll admit, because I had expected the PTAwould complain]. The lecturewent off very nicely, and I received my first honorarium: a glass bowlcontaining a variety of plants and aminiature vampire statue.190Anton LaVey was off on a whirlwind tour of the United States to promote theCompleat Witch. Hisschedule wouldn’t take him to Louisville, said Diane, but could we come toChicago? We could; theGrotto piled into the Fosters’ VW bus [how can any organization survive withouta VW bus?] and drove toIllinois. As reported in the Grotto’s newsletter The Blacklist:On the weekend of February 19-21 a delegation from the Nineveh Grotto traveledto Chicago for anaudience and informal meeting with the High Priest. Passing through the WindyCity in the course of thepromotional tour for The Compleat Witch, Dr. LaVey was kind enough to receiveNineveh’s representativesin the Sheraton-Chicago Hotel, after which he took them on a spur-of-the-momenttour of Chicago’shighlights - the “Old Town” area, State Street, and the Loop.“Old Town” in particular proved to be a veritable warren of small bookstores,curio/miscellanea shops,and various oddball attractions - such as the House of Horror, wherein medievaltorture methods weredepicted in mannequin exhibits whose figures alone were a museum attraction.The Grotto was also able to visit the John Hancock Center building - thegigantic, trapezoidal monoliththat towers above Chicago’s skyline. On an earlier visit to the jet-colorededifice with the High Priest, Rev.Aquino learned that the Order of the Trapezoid entertained a subtle butinfluential interest in the Center’sdesign techniques and angular appearances. A glance at the structure’s unearthlydimensions - crowned bythe two horn-like antennae - made it obvious that factors above and beyond thoseof conventional humanarchitecture were involved in its conception. In emphasis to the presence of theCenter, Dr. LaVey and Rev.Aquino celebrated a commemorative ritual of the Order in the Sybaris loungesituated atop the building.191That commemorative ritual was in fact a reading of “Die Elektrischen Vorspiele”(Appendix #5). Onemust visit the Sybaris (named for the ancient Magna Græcia city renowned for itsopulence andindulgence) during the hours of darkness to appreciate how appropriate this was.At midnight, the two red-lit antennae of the building rising above like horns, we looked forth from theprismatic viewports over apanorama of thousands of lights converging in hundreds of trapezoids at thevisual horizon. The interior ofSybaris became hushed as others present fell silent to listen to Anton’sutterance of the great litany; andthe very Tower of the Trapezoid itself seemed to undergo indefinable geometricconvulsions as ourperception of time failed altogether. Then it was over, and we were back in theobjective universe.The VW bus “rogue’s tour” of Chicago was, in its own way, equally startling.Anton, in a leather coatand woolen cap that made him look for all the world like a reincarnation ofLenin, presided as tour guidefrom the front of the bus as we tore through the most heinous parts of the city.Haunted houses, famousprohibition-era landmarks, and sites of particularly unspeakable crimes werepointed out to us as thoughwe were a Grey Line excursion. Trying to keep my balance as I perched on a coilof rope at the back of thebus, I wondered how it would all look in some future memoir. [Well, here it is!]189 Cloven Hoof, February VI/1971, page #1.190 Blacklist, Nineveh Grotto, February 15, VI/1971 & March 1, VI/1971.191 Ibid., March 1, VI/1971.- 108 -The next day, as the Grotto was recovering from “Old Town” by the sensible meansof a return visit,Anton went to a bookstore across the street from the Sheraton-Chicago toautograph copies of theCompleat Witch. As he picked up the first one, a woman came running into thestore, asked him if he knewwhere she could get the Compleat Witch “by Anton LaVey”, grabbed a copy off thetable he indicatedbefore him, threw some money at the cashier, and bolted back out the door -obviously completelyunaware she had just met the author in question. He shrugged, adjusted the Leninhat, and jotted his namein all of the other copies!That evening I accompanied Anton to a radio interview he was scheduled to giveas part of theCompleat Witch promotional plan. Participating with him were Curtis and MaryFuller, Publisher andEditor of Fate, a modest yet surprisingly durable occult magazine. Anton steeredthe conversation awayfrom esoterica and towards Satanism as a rational, practical approach to life;this took the Fullerssomewhat by surprise but won him a barrage of favorable telephone calls.As we returned from the radio station to the hotel, I heard disturbing news:John Ferro had beenremoved from his supervisory position at the Central Grotto, and Anton hadfurther directed that herelinquish the IV° of Magister and return to the III° of Priest. Details werenot forthcoming, and not forseveral years would I learn the story behind this unfortunate development.192During the first week of March Anton visited Wayne West and the Babylon Grottoin Michigan, wherethe atmosphere was presumably somewhat less crazed than it had been in Chicago.To the Central GrottoWest subsequently wrote:I do not think I need tell you of the tremendous pride I now hold as a result ofmy most privilegedmeeting with the Magus. I was deeply moved by his kindness to me and can onlyexpress my deep regretthat he was unable to stay for a longer period of time. Those members of theBabylon Grotto who were alsoprivileged to meet His Excellency have expressed the greatest pleasure and havebeen inspired to evengreater faith and allegiance to the Church.I can only hope that the Magus did not feel that the time was ill-spent with us,since he had instilled inthe entire membership an awe-inspiring will to promote the growth of the Churchat every opportunity. Formy part, I shall cherish the memory of his visit for all the days and nights tocome. I am tired, exhausted,sore-backed, etc., but I would not have missed the encounter for the Crown ofEngland. 193From Detroit Anton flew on to New York City for further Compleat Witchpromotional interviews inthe company of a delighted [and somewhat awestruck] Witch Sinclair, whom heproudly introduced as hisideal Compleat Witch. Upon departing the city for San Francisco, he said that hehad been greatlyimpressed with both her work in the Church and her presence on this occasion,and that he recommendedshe take the examination for the Priesthood of Mendes. 194Back at the Central Grotto Diane had just confirmed the I° membership of aMarine Lance Corporalstationed at the Cherry Point, North Carolina Marine Corps Air Station. To thestandard acceptance letterDiane added:Dear Mr. Seago:We were very favorably impressed with your application. We feel certain you willbe a most valuableaddition to our Order, and we look forward to a long and mutually-rewardingassociation with you. You willundoubtedly be pleased to know that Lovecraft and Howard are the High Priest’sfavorites also!195192 See letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, December 21, VIII/1973 [in text,Chapter #27].193 West, Wayne F. in Cloven Hoof, April VI/1971.194 See text, Chapter #13.195 Letter, Diane LaVey to L. Dale Seago, March 7, VI/1971.- 109 -Nineveh resumed its active program of ritual, discussion, and recreation.Sometimes all three werecombined, as on one occasion in March when an aggressive young Bible student andhis self-righteousmentor secured an invitation to visit a “genuine Satanic ceremony” - quiteobviously so they coulddescribe it in shocked and lurid stories for the next ten years. The Grotto putits collective heads togetherand decided to give these “Daniels in the Lions’ Den” their money’s worth.Solemnly they were informed that Nineveh was going to attempt a very difficultand dangerousWorking last performed successfully by John Dee in a London cemetery: necromancy- the raising of adead body to life. The ritual chamber was decorated in a really terrible mixtureof pseudo-Satanica andsuburban-funeral-parlor, complete with enough carnation incense to make the moststolid undertakerqueasy. The most slender girl in the Grotto received ashen eye and cheek makeupa la Night of the LivingDead and was anointed head-to-foot in corpse-pale powder. Stretched out on aslab and covered only by asheet [we thought we might as well appeal to any latent necrophilia in ourvisitors while we were at it],she looked, well, real dead.The Christians [the teacher of whom was slightly drunk, no doubt to gain couragefor the evening]were led into the chamber, shown the “corpse”, and warned of the consequencesshould they ever revealthey had seen such an experiment. “Tomorrow we’ll return the body to, uh, whereit came from in anycase, so no one will be any the wiser.” Then, our two miserable Daniels huddlingin the rear of thechamber, we did our best Nineveh “thing”, as recounted in the Blacklist:A brief review of some of the monologues involved in the ritual: The openingrecital, spoken byStephen and Pamela Foster, was taken from the funeral ritual of the Aztec nationand dates back severalcenturies before the arrival of the Spanish forces. The proclamation of the“soul” of the body, spoken bySpider Woman, came from the Golden Plates of the Orphic-Pythagorean Brotherhoodof ancient Greece.The manifesto of Lucifer, spoken by Cliff Amos, derived from a ceremonialsequence of the Order of theGolden Dawn. Finally the dialogue between Janet Aquino and the LuciferianPresence was transcribed fromthe curious Chapter XVII of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. This chapter, whoseultimate insinuations stillremain a mystery to Egyptologists, shatters many stereotypical interpretationsof the religious andcosmological systems of ancient Khem. It can be traced back at least as far asthe IV Dynasty, and someauthorities think that this particular portion of the Book of the Dead may bethe oldest known document ofthe human race.Those attending the ritual will have observed that the authority of this chapterdid not accept the soul ofthe departed into Amenti - as did the litanies of the later, Osiriandeath-worshipping cults - but reviled thestate of death and cast the soul back into the world of life. Also significantis the contention of Ra/Luciferthat his is an existence completely divorced from the natural order - somethingwhich readers of “Beyondthe Abyss” may consider in their speculations concerning man’s origins andintellectual capacities.196As the invocations thundered to their height and periodic blasts of Dragon’sBreath illuminated thechamber, our fair corpse - who until now had lain perfectly motionless under thesheet - shuddered slightlyand let one arm fall stiffly off her chest onto the floor beside the slab. Thatwas enough for the twoseminarians; they bolted out the front door, whereupon the Grotto collapsed inlaughter. The only problemwas that the house had to be aired out for a week to get rid of the terriblepseudocarnation smell.The elderly teacher had had enough and was never heard from again, but hisdisciple decided to inviteJanet to address a seminar at the Louisville Baptist Seminary. Apparently, saidthe Blacklist:… he had it in mind to present our representatives as occultist oddballs ratherthan as serious theologians,since he prefaced his introduction with the distribution of a small pamphletentitled “Occult Oppression andBondage - How to be Set Free!” This curious document identifies said oppressionand bondage by thefollowing symptoms: “Indifference, irresponsibility, unpredictable behavior,delusions, sexual perversions,compulsive eating, compulsions, obsessions, psychic experiences (not to beconfused with genuine gifts of196 Blacklist, March 1, VI/1971.- 110 -the Holy Spirit), unscriptural religious beliefs, blasphemous thoughts againstGod, abnormal loudness,muttering to oneself, abnormally bright or glazed eyes, sullen or defiant facialexpressions, and physicalailments that do not respond to prayer.” 197Good insight in summing us up considering that he didn’t even stay for coffeeafter the ritual.Janet submitted her Priesthood examination, and a letter came for her from Antonin mi-March:It is my pleasure to inform you that you have passed the examination for theThird Degree withcommendation, thus resulting in your elevation to the Priesthood of Mendes.Congratulations on your newrole as a Priestess of the Church of Satan. Your graceful beauty and genuinesweetness of nature will, withyour capacity for logic and reason, serve you well in the magic of the future.You are a credit to ourOrder. 198Now that the Compleat Witch seemed off to a good start, Anton was impatient toget back to the moreesoteric pursuits of Satanism. The Satanic Bible, with six paperback printingsunder its belt, was nowscheduled for a seventh - and for a hardcover printing by University Books.Anton was aware that it waswell on its way to becoming not just a best-selling book, but a classic in itsfield. To me he wrote:With each succeeding printing of the Satanic Bible [with hardcover publicationin the offing], theexisting introduction by Burton Wolfe becomes more and more obsolete, casual,and inadequate [especiallythe mealy-mouthed last paragraph!]. In short, I would like you to write a newintroduction. I have alreadyspoken with the Editor of Avon Books about your doing this, and he is quiteenthused.He glanced at the Diabolicon while he was in S.F. earlier this week and isespecially taken with my planfor getting it into print as per our discussion in Chicago.The new intro for the Bible should bear your name if possible, but if not youmay use a pseudonym.The biographical sketch of myself should be basically the same, but in your ownwords, of course. Lessspace should be devoted to the types of rituals we were doing (psychodrama,etc.), and more emphasisshould be placed on what is happening now: how we have become a force to bereckoned with, ourorganizational maturity, the various levels of involvement, our magicalinfluence in the world outside theChurch, our growing acceptance and legitimacy, our elitist principles, ourseemingly paradoxical support oflaw and order and refutation of the drug scene, our objectivistic outlook whileplacing great emphasis onritual and ceremony of the most secret nature - in short, a projection of enoughawesomeness to thrill andscare the reader, yet not allow him any avenue to which, as a “red-blooded,law-abiding American”, hecould possibly object!Because of your writing ability, combined with your PSYOP training, I feel thatyou alone could do theright job. It appears that the Satanic Bible is going to be around for a long,long time, and I want you tohave a hand in it.The Diabolicon can either be re-set in available text-type print or photo-offsetfrom your original handprinting. It has been decided that it should definitely be presented asapocrypha, a la the Necronomicon orBook of Mormon. I will present it as having passed into my hands, and you willbe credited with thetransliteration and editing for publication. We envision it as a perfectfollow-up for The Morning of theMagicians and the Satanic Bible. 199My Introduction (Appendix #10) was more complex than expected, because it wasdifficult to writeabout Satanic philosophy while not intruding into the text and thrust of thebook itself. Furthermore, in myenthusiastic attempt to write a truly enduring and profoundly sophisticatedpiece, I plunged into languageso abstract and academic that I daresay most readers had a hard timeunderstanding it.197 Ibid., April 23, VI/1971.198 Letter, Anton LaVey to Janet Aquino, March 17, VI/1971.199 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 1, VI/1971.- 111 -There are some passages which I still find appropriate, but on the whole I wouldprefer to rewrite it -both to make it more readable and to bring it more into line with the analysiscomprising Chapter #6 ofthis work. [I consider the new Burton Wolfe introduction that has appeared inthe 12th paperback printingof the Bible seriously deficient because of the superficiality and factualinaccuracies contained therein. Itsultimate impact will be harmful to the volume’s credibility and dignity - andauthenticity.]The Cloven Hoof celebrated Anton LaVey’s 41st birthday with an editorialentitled “The True Nativity- and Proof Beyond a Shadow”:When our leader’s nines are five, with certainty we shall bear witness to theelevation of the Church andits membership on to a great new plateau. With a fervor born of knowledge, witha joy spawned of wisdom,let us assiduously strive towards this exalted state and a Renaissance image,that we may fulfill our potentialas individuals, each transformed into the “universal man”.Thus on April 11 we honor the birthday of our leader, His Excellency, the HighPriest of the Church ofSatan. In so doing this Easter Sunday, we shall be fashioning our formidablestake in the future - the pointof which grandly impaling once again the ancient, decaying remains of thatsimpering impostor, the vilestof all vampires to afflict the Western world! Hail to our Dark Prince and to HisProphet!200Anton added emphasis to this cheerful forecast with a cover illustration showinga somewhat felinedemon with scaled torso and barbed tail munching thoughtfully on what he hadapparently torn from anearby cross - now containing only nailed-up hands and feet. There is this aboutAnton LaVey drawings:one either loathes them or delights in them - nothing in-between.In the main hall and Purple Room of 6114 California Street are a number of oilpaintings by Anton,mostly done in the 1950s and early 1960s while he still had time for suchleisurely pursuits. [See Plates.]The subjects are as varied as they are intriguing. In one canvas a monstrous fly(Beelzebub?) wings itsway towards the viewer from the window of an evil-looking tower. In another alivid-eyed skeleton rides athrashing, Hellish roller-coaster, and in still another a drab waterfront sceneis enlivened (?) by a deadhand seen in one of the windows of the melancholy buildings. A cliff overlookingthe sea becomessomewhat more sinister by virtue of a small gallows at its edge. In the paintingchosen for The Devil’sAvenger, a soulless-looking man stands in front of a Victorian mansion, gazingwith only marginal interestat a blood-drenched hatchet he is holding. A small painting shows anotherVictorian mansion engulfed inflames that light it with a soft glow instead of consuming it. Diane asked me ifI would like anything inreturn for the Satanic Bible Introduction, “An Anton LaVey original?” I said.But he paintings were noteven allowed out of the house. And her husband was extremely cool to the idea ofreleasing any of hisother drawings or sketches.A Diane/Janet conspiracy ensued. Craftily Diane asked Anton to sign and date apen-and-ink drawinghe had made of a little chateau, on the pretext of recording its sequence ofexecution. The unsuspectingBlack Pope complied, and the contraband art was on its way to Kentucky with allthe security of ashipment of White Lightning. It arrived on May 5th, was professionally mountedand framed, and todayremains one of my most fondly-regarded treasures. 201Janet was herself a skilled artist and art historian, and she now decided that afew words on Satanic artmight be appropriate for an essay. Her “Æsthetic Adversary” (Appendix #25)appeared in the May 4thBlacklist and remains, I think, one of the clearest and most accurate statementson its subject.On the eleventh of May Anton again flew east, not to recapture the fugitivedrawing but to make aguest appearance on the prestigious Phil Donahue Show in Dayton, Ohio.By now the Babylon Grotto, as a consequence of Wayne West’s energetic efforts,was actually threeGrottos in one. The two sub-units were centered in a suburb of Detroit [laterchartered as the Belphegor200 Cloven Hoof, April VI/1971, page #1.201 The chateau sketch is dated April VI A.S.- 112 -Grotto and led by Warlock Douglas Robbins] and in Dayton, [later chartered asthe Stygian Grotto and ledby Warlock John DeHaven]. When Anton disembarked at the Dayton Airport, he wasmet by a Stygianhonor guard that would have done credit to a Prussian king. His appearance onthe Phil Donahue Showwas a great success, again marking a major departure from the “stuffed rats andtombstones” coverage ofearlier days. 202On the way home Anton decided to stop by Louisville for a visit and to meetthose Nineveh memberswho had been unable to come to Chicago. The “Red Flash” edition of theLouisville Times printed aninterview (Appendix #26) which he gave to Becky Homan, the pleasant youngjournalist whose earlierpage #1 story on Nineveh had been so fair and empathetic.Anton enjoyed an evening of conversation with the local membership at the newGrotto House indowntown Louisville. Later, at our home, he expressed a desire to see the PattonMuseum at Fort Knox[world-famous for its collection of tanks and other armored vehicles from manynations]. We drove downto the Fort, but there seemed to be a slight problem: Vice-President Spiro Agnewalso wanted to see themuseum, and it had been cleared and closed by the U.S. Secret Service for hisvisit later that day. Therewas a hurried conference with the Secret Service. A few moments later the HighPriest of the Church ofSatan toured the exhibits in solitary majesty, signing his name to the guestbook just before that of theVice-President, who arrived minutes after we departed. [I expect thejuxtaposition of those two signatureshas since startled not a few visitors.]203With membership continuing to mushroom and yet another Grotto (the TyphonGrotto, under theleadership of Larry Green - the Priest who had been my subdeacon at the 6114Missa Solemnis) receivingits charter in San Francisco, Anton decided it was time to implement a majorrestructuring of the entireChurch of Satan. And so here at last the Church ceased to be a San Franciscoinstitution with appendages.Henceforth it would be a truly national organization with all of the differentopportunities, benefits, andproblems commensurate with that status.The first step in this transformation was the creation of a decentralized systemof Regional Agents -Witches and Warlocks (II°) who would represent the Church in areas not served bychartered Grottos. Theletter sent to those selected as the first Regional Agents is reproduced here asAppendix #27. With thecopy sent to me, Diane added her own comments:As I think Anton explained to you, these individuals come from all levels ofsociety and all educationaland economic backgrounds. Some are what we would call “real winners” (those whowe feel relativelycertain will eventually organize functioning Grottos), and others are just nice,“average” people who appearto have the best interests of the Church of Satan at heart. Out of the fifty orso letters we have sent out,probably half will accept the position; and out of those possibly 50% will turnout to be good organizers.We think this plan will help members on all levels. We will probably seek yourhelp with regard to theRegional Agents’ individual problems that will undoubtedly spring up in thecourse of their duties. It is ourintention that Priests and Grotto Leaders who have “proven themselves” willcommunicate with RegionalAgents, and the Agents will deal with the individual members in their ownrespective locations. In otherwords, we are trying to ease the workload for everyone, not just for ourselvesat the Central Grotto. Butthen you already know all this; your capsulation of the new policy in theBlacklist indicates that you needno further explanation.Who knows what these changes might bring about? Whatever results, it is going tobe interesting to see,and I’m sure we can look forward to an exciting first few months on the newsystem. If all this onlysucceeds in bringing one more couple like you and Janet to the fore, then itwill be well worth the effort. 204202 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 6, VI/1971.203 See guest register, Patton Museum, Fort Knox, Kentucky, ca. May 15, 1971.204 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 3, VI/1971.[index-113_1.jpg]- 113 -In the 1980s the United States and several other countries would be torn apartby nationwide waves of“Satanic crime” conspiracy hysteria, which it took almost a decade to expose asnothing more than anutterly baseless “urban myth”. One of the ironies in that stupid, shameful, anddestructive witch-hunt wasthat the legitimate and law-abiding nature of actual Satanism had long sincebeen established by theoriginal Church of Satan during its 1966-75 very-public existence, and moreformally if somewhat lessflamboyantly by the Temple of Set in the following decade.What came to be known in the Church of Satan as the “Northglenn Incident” is aclassic example ofjust how sensitive the Church actually was to compliance with the law, goodcommunity relations, and theintegrity of its own name. Seen in retrospect against the horrors of the 1980switch-hunts, it also indicatesthe naïvete with which the Church trusted in First Amendment protections -although in the idealisticsocial climate of the 1960s-70s, there was not a hint of the maniacal Dark Ageto come.By mid-VI/1971 the Plutonian Grotto in Denver was progressing nicely under theleadership ofCharles Steenbarger, otherwise known in the Church by his pseudonym of“Adrian-Claude Frazier”.Steenbarger’s secular history was quite distinguished. After eight years as acombat B-17 pilot duringthe World War II period, he transferred his commission to the Army MedicalService Corps and servedeighteen years as a clinical psychologist. He performed such special assignmentsas Chairman of theIntelligence Committee of the Psychological Warfare School, Fort Bragg; and heserved overseas with the7th Infantry Division in Korea and the 8th Army in Japan. He finally retired asa Lieutenant Colonel tobecome Director of a Community Mental Health Clinic in the Denver area. He waspublished in theJournal of the American Health Association and held memberships in the AmericanPsychologicalAssociation and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Heenjoyed hunting, writingpoetry, and playing a magnificent Gulbransen Rialto concert organ in his Aurorahome. 205But suddenly, in May of VI/1971, the Plutonians found themselves in the middleof a crisis, theoutcome of which would have far-reaching effects upon the Church of Satan. Itbegan with an article inthe local Free Dispatch newspaper on May 13:Youth Cult Cracked by Northglenn Burglary ArrestNorthglenn: A religious cult in which the blood of slain small animals was drunkby its 20 to 25 teenagemembers was broken up here this week when police arrested two Northglenn highschool students forinvestigation of burglary of the First Southern Baptist Church, 106th Ave. andWashington St., according toDetective Ray Barr. Barr said one youth signed a statement admitting he and hiscompanion had taken 13choir robes valued at $174 from the church in the burglary last week.Arrest of an unidentified “high priest” of the religious cult was expectedmomentarily Wednesdaymorning. According to Detective Barr, the youths told him between 20 and 25students at Northglenn High205 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to M.A. Aquino, January 17, VII/1972.- 114 -School and Northeast Junior High were members of the cult, which practicedreligion taught in a “satanicbible” confiscated when the boys were arrested.The “Black Magic Cult”, as it was described by the boys, conducted ceremonies ina field nearNorthglenn. Small animals, such as rabbits and chickens, were “sacrificed” toobtain their blood formembers to drink, said Barr. “One teaching of the cult was that every young girlshould sacrifice hervirginity to male cult members. This is no kids’ game - it is real,” DetectiveBarr related.Ceremonies were held using the stolen robes for members and the high priest, whowore the maroonrobe and a neck piece of red velvet trimmed with white, Barr said. “Use of drugswas not preached by thecult, but members were told they could use them prior to ceremonies if theywished,” the detective said hewas told. No drugs were seized when the youths were arrested, Barr said.“This thing is absolutely bizarre,” said Chief Ray Marzoch Wednesday morning.“There are at least twocults, and I would guess they involve 35 to 40 young people each. They useprivate residences when theparents are not home, but most ceremonies are held in the open. They drive theircars to a spot, set up analtar, and hold ceremonies. This is a drug oriented sect, and we have been toldof instances where drugswere forced upon another young person. One kid was held down, got a puncturedartery, and almost bled todeath. We have had thefts of guinea pigs and gerbils from schools, andpersonally I think they are raisingtheir own gerbils for use in sacrifices. This thing can lead to the slaughteringof a human. We must put astop to it.”Marzoch added that police will inform parents when young people are suspected oftaking part in thebizarre ceremonies, and it is hoped that parents will cooperate in helping theiryoung people find morehealthy activities. 206The “satanic bible” found was in fact the Satanic Bible. On May 31 Steenbargerwrote to Anton:The reaction to the “Satanic” cult reached critical or hysterical proportions onDenver’s talk program,which features the rigid crackpot Bob McWilliams. The theme was: “Satanism hasfinally reached Denver!How can we protect our children?” The Birchites got in on the act and introducedthe pamphlet “Satanism -A Practical Guide to Witch Hunting”, justifying the hunt on the basis of the“radical socialism” involved.Diane said you are all aware of Gumaer’s article from American Opinion magazine.Well, after several days of this nonsense on the news media, including theassociation of your namewith the cult in Northglenn, the noise came to a screeching halt and hascompletely died out as far aspublicity goes. My contacts tell me, however, that an intensive investigation isgoing on to find the leader,who is believed to be an adult. Also, since many prominent families areinvolved, the whole matter has hadto be hushed up. One source told me that they are also concerned about sellingSatanism by making toomuch noise about it. One of the articles, you will notice, promises religiousfreedom for the religious part ofit as long as it does not violate the law.The Grotto is taking it well but is a bit uptight, concerned that theinvestigation will reach us. OnFriday, May 28 we held a general meeting at which time I laid the matter beforethe general membership.Their reaction was to favor Diane’s suggestion that we run a double programhere: an open Grotto and aclandestine Grotto, Pluto appropriately being underground. There were a fewdissenting votes indicatingthat if this happens we will lose some members but probably retain the majority.My pitch to them was: The country is being overtaken with a lust for religion.The substratum of themovement is paganistic, unique, and diversified. The perversion of our sourcebook, the Satanic Bible, is tobe expected as a function of this diversification accompanying thedisorganization of organized religion.This social phenomenon is probably going to advance so that sooner or later somekind of investigation willget to us, unless we propose the open Grotto, which will be in a position tooffer disclaimers and stand upfor the organization. The social climate is right for coming out into the open.Accordingly I recommend that we look for a leader - Priest of Mendes - for theDenver area who wouldbe willing to divert attention from the underground movement. The members of thePlutonian Grotto wouldlike:206 Denver Free Dispatch, May 13, 1971.- 115 -(1) Complete anonymity even from the Priest of Mendes. The only exception wouldbe me. I would beknown to the Priest but not to the public.(2) Both Grottos would support one another recruitmentwise through the Priestsand highly selectmembership committees.(3) The underground group would probably consist of more prominent people withsensitive careerpositions and would accordingly be charged with carrying Satanism to high placeswithout the label. In thelong run this ought to be the most important function. The aboveground groupcould mass-recruit, establishmore levels of membership, and deal with the public while acting as diversionfor the Plutonian Grotto.(4) The aboveground group should defer to the underground group, who willsupport them from behindthe scenes and from high places.(5) The underground [Grotto] will absorb members of the open Grotto if theirstatus should change sothat this is demanded.Getting back to the current scene, we feel that a letter to the persons listedin the postscript (the policeofficials, the principal newspapers, and the local radio station) would behelpful should the investigationreach us. The members requested the following:(1) That attention not be drawn to the existence of a Grotto in Denver - ratherthat the source ofinformation about the Northglenn cult be “a member of the Central Grottovisiting relatives in Denver”.(2) That the letter specify that children cannot join the Church withoutparental consent.(3) That the Church of Satan welcomes the prospect of such legal violationsbeing prosecuted by theestablishment.(4) And, most important of all, that the High Priest’s name be disassociatedfrom the cult, with attentiondrawn to passages of the Satanic Bible which refute the cult’s practices. I amsure Mr. Kincaid will be ableto think of other things which could be said.The Plutonian Grotto continues to be strong, cohesive, regular, and infernallyinspired, and becomingimbued with Satanic pride. We are currently upgrading our ritual environment andintensifying organizationpreliminary to starting another group. We are currently recruiting by word ofmouth only; that is, newmembers will already be known to existing members - at least until the presentcrisis is over, because weare trying to avoid infiltration. 207As may well be imagined, Anton LaVey wasn’t too terribly pleased by the “chargeto the rear” ofSteenbarger and his Plutonians. He had received an initial briefing from Dianebefore Steenbarger’s letterarrived, and he responded to the Denver Priest with a missive of his own:Lady Diane related the events of the past week in Denver and their bearing uponthe Church. Needlessto say, I am appalled at the lack of reaction on the part of the Denvermembership to this flagrant exampleof “guilt through association”. I and the worthy organization which I representhave apparently been citedas part and parcel to the tomfoolery of irresponsible youths, and not a singlelocal voice of Satanic authorityhas been heard from.I request that each and every member of the Plutonian Grotto who has the priceof a phone call, a pieceof paper, and an implement with which to write communicate with every accessibleform of media anddisclaim whatever aspersions against the Church and its followers may haveensued. Aliases may or maynot be used, depending upon the requirements of each responding member. The mainthing is to respond.Let it be known, in no uncertain terms, that the culprits cited are notSatanists, the Church isdiametrically opposed to crime against persons or property, and the Birchpamphlet is a mass of lies writtenby a hysterical young man who didn’t print a single word which was told to himby the High Priest of theChurch, inventing his story whole cloth instead.We must make our position clear. Contradiction of cherished lies andenlightenment from admittedSatanists’ mouths is our most potent weapon. Whatever we say that violates theirpreconceived notions isfar more confounding and shocking than the stuff they have been fed. They’lllisten! Remember the parableof the sadist and the masochist: “Beat me!” “No, I won’t!”207 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to Anton LaVey, May 31, VI/1971.- 116 -“Stop the way of them that would persecute you. Let those who devise thy undoingbe hurled back toconfusion and infamy. Let them be as chaff before the cyclone; and after theyhave fallen, rejoice in thyown salvation.” 208Steenbarger wrote back:It would be helpful if at this time we could achieve clarification as to thefuture status and nature of thePlutonian Grotto, i.e. whether it is expected to operate in an undergroundmanner. It has been myunderstanding all along that the Grotto was to operate clandestinely only, underthe assumption that myresponsibilities for the Satanic Priesthood were limited by a busy professionalschedule and a sensitiveposition with the public sector in Denver. Moreover all 12 active members nowattending rituals aresimilarly limited and consequently cannot afford the risk of affirming theirmembership to the public, norare they comfortable in even affirming the existence of the Grotto to the publicuntil an open Grotto canassume that position.Your letter hurt a great deal because it conveyed the message that we lackedcourage and concern tospeak up in defense of your esteemed person and the Church of Satan. I canassure you as your devotedfriend and Priest of the Black Order that this is not so, but that instead oursilence followed a great restraint.It would have been easier for most members to blurt out their indignation asmany wanted to do. Ourrestraint developed, however, on the basis of an impeccable Satanic logic, giventhat we were all vulnerableto public hysteria and disclosure: If our careers and reputations are scuttled,so then are we scuttled asa resource to the Church of Satan, since our positions give us a very usefulbase of power andinfluence within the establishment. Hence the justification for Pluto remainingunderground.I respectfully submit that the [2-Grotto, above/underground] arrangement iswholly compatible with ouroriginal understanding about the nonpublic nature of our operation in Denver andwhich I assumed was inaccordance with my title as Priest of the Black Order. At the present time ourmembership has accordinglybeen composed of persons who have signed a Grotto oath and been guaranteed inreturn that his or heridentity and the existence of the Grotto would remain protected from publicityuntil another Grotto couldassume a diversive, public position. If I now force them to contact the newsmedia, even under the use ofaliases, this would violate the original agreement with them and probablyalienate them permanently.Please rest assured that, as our Grotto has stabilized and gained substance,your image has becomestronger and stronger. While we regret that we are the most quiet andnon-expansive of all the Grottos atthis time, I firmly believe that with the [2 Grottos] plan fulfilled we couldoutdistance all of them except theCentral Grotto. That is the nature of our Satanic pride. 209With this letter our B-17 bomber pilot included three letters from members ofhis Grotto - one incompliance with Anton’s request and two disdainfully refusing. I presume thatwhen this little packagearrived at 6114 California Street, the neighbors wondered whether Togare hadcome back and was againtearing the place apart.Anton, however, faced a problem: Chuck Steenbarger was an old friend frompre-1966 days, and hewas reluctant to let that friendship be jeopardized. Moreover there were onlyfive members of the SatanicPriesthood outside of San Francisco at this time [Moody, West, Steenbarger,Janet, and myself], and Antondidn’t want to lose one of those Priests and one of his four local Grottos if atall possible. His eventualresponse to Steenbarger displayed admirable composure where Steenbarger himselfwas concerned, butthings did not go so easy with the outspoken Grotto members:It appears that I have been “told off” and served an ultimatum by these two“excellent” members. I shallconcede to these lovely ladies and refrain from making further requests thatthey subject themselves topublic ridicule and ruination by insisting, “with insults”, that they “defend mybook”!208 Letter, Anton LaVey to Charles Steenbarger, May 27, VI/1971.209 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to Anton LaVey, June 5, VI/1971.- 117 -Thanks to Miss Rich, I now realize that it was rather silly of me to raise aruckus over a mere paperbackbook, knowing she would not have acted in such an irrational manner were her ownSunday AfternoonAstrologer implicated in “some adolescent sensationalism”. You may assure herthat I no longer cherish thepreposterous notion that the Satanic Bible - and the Church of Satan - representthe most drastic change inthe field of religion in almost two thousand years.And do tell Miss Dill that Mr. LaVey brightened considerably upon reading herencouraging suggestionthat it is a “bit Satanic to say ‘pay your money and do as you please with it’”,for fear I have not been livingup to my mercenary image resulting from a certain portion of media coverage onthe “Church of Satan” andmyself.Curious, isn’t it, that it hadn’t even occurred to me that I might be cuttingmyself out of “further dueschecks” from certain members by writing that unreasonable letter? Miss Rich madea very good point; Ishall take care to consider such eventualities if I ever again dare to requestassistance from my devotedfollowers. Yes, I do most humbly concede. But, you may be assured, theirs is aPyrrhic victory!I am not in the habit of tolerating the sort of peer-level criticism as has beendirected towards me bythese two women. They are out of their league; it is the Church of Satan theyare dealing with now, not thelocal coven of half-baked psychics, mystics, astrologers, and other assortedfans of occult academia. Theyhad best learn that we are devils - not saints! The “Church of Satan” as theyknow it - and most of themembership, I must admit - represents but the tip of the iceberg in a plan thatwill succeed and a future thatis ensured.If Mesdames Rich and Dill wish to maintain their status in our InfernalBrotherhood, I would advisethem to toughen their hides so as to withstand any future “insults” which maycome their way. If theyexpect to be treated as peers, then they’d be wise to confine their occultpursuits to the minor league, wherethey can while away their time in puerile, democratic debates with otheracademicians of the unknown. Butif they presume to call themselves Satanists and wish to benefit from theknowledge and experience ofmasterful practitioners of the Black Arts, I strongly suggest that they rallytogether every fragment ofSatanic wisdom which they have been privileged to receive and utilize same tocompose a letter of apology… Pardon shall be granted only if due humility is evidenced. This is myultimatum!210Anton added a letter for Steenbarger to read to the Plutonian membership:Members of the Plutonian Grotto:It has been brought to my attention that many of you are disturbed over myrecent request that youclarify the misconceptions about the Church which have evidently arisen from thearrest of youths whowere seemingly practicing “Satanic rites”.My request was prompted by a call from Rev. Frazier, who seemed genuinelyagitated and distraught atwhat he felt was a gross campaign of misinformation and hysteria concerningSatanism. Rev. Frazier statedthat certain of his members had to be restrained from sending rebuttals to themedia, basing his cease-fireupon the premise that it was not to be known that an actual branch of the Churchof Satan exists in theDenver area.The reason for not allowing knowledge of such a group is to avoid any subsequentinvestigation whichmight expose members who wish to remain anonymous. This is and always has beenan approach withwhich I concur.Apparently my request was not read by the Denver members, for nowhere did itstate that any memberhad to identify himself using his actual name. Nor did my request even mentionthat the respondent reply asa representative of a local chapter. My prime concern was that the record be setstraight, rebuttal andclarification coming from whatever isolated source possible, with anonymityexercised by the respondingmember should he or she so desire.It appears to me that some of our Denver members would like to be as ostriches,assuming that if no“real” Satanist is heard from, it will be thought that Denver is “pure” and“clean” and unique amongAmerican cities for being devoid of members of the Church of Satan.210 Letter, Anton LaVey to Charles Steenbarger, June 18, VI/1971.- 118 -Just as every city has its share of juvenile hooligans (who might read theSatanic Bible), each city mustbe expected to have its small coterie of real Satanists. It is up to the genuinearticle to set the record straightby whatever means may be necessary. A single, powerful, clarifying voice, ifproperly applied, can reach asmany people as the original misinformation. If something is vital enough toraise an issue, the other side issure to be heard, if only to maintain media time and space.I will not accept the lame excuse of some who have whined that they cannotafford to risk all they haveby exposure and that the carrying out of my request can only lead to suchruination. One needn’t sign a truename or address when writing to an editor. Talk shows do not ask foridentification from each caller.Our greatest weapon lies in our ability to utter words and phrases that, onceheard, will leave thelistener with grave doubts as to his own philosophical commitments. If Satanismis to flourish, we must sowthe seeds of doubt in the minds of the benumbed. Then, when the proper timearrives, the masses willaccept what we have said. It can be said nefariously. It can be saidanonymously. It can be said insidiously.But it must be said.The most powerful thing in the world is an idea whose time has come round. 211Anton sent the draft first to Wayne West and myself for our comments:Please read the enclosed correspondence regarding recent difficulty in Denverand its subsequent effecton the Plutonian Grotto under the leadership of Rev. Frazier.[Enclosed] is a draft of a letter I had intended to send to Rev. Frazier to beread to members of thePlutonian Grotto. Before doing so, however, I had second thoughts on the matter.It might be too strong - ornot strong enough. It was then that I decided to solicit diverse opinions beforeproceeding further. Rev.Frazier has been a good and loyal associate for several years, and it is my mainconcern to spare his feelingswhile still doing what must be done. Being in somewhat the same position ofleadership as Rev. Frazier,what would you consider fair? 212Where Wayne West was concerned this was rather like waving a red flag before abull. He wasinfuriated by the behavior of Steenbarger and his Grotto, and he pulled nopunches in saying so:I am deeply distressed anent the Denver situation and cannot pretend to leniencyinsofar as concerns theobvious cowardice of those members of the Plutonian Grotto in failing to speakout in defense of theChurch of Satan. One is loyal or one is not to those doctrines and philosophiesupon which the Order isfounded.Nor can I suppose that my own civil employment is so unimportant that my overtalliance with theChurch could present serious problems. Such is not the case, however, and I havefound such overtnessgenerally acceptable to the masses once our doctrines have been properlyexpressed.For the Plutonians, therefore, to cower in terror and fear, and to fail touphold the tenets of ourphilosophies is, in my personal opinion, tantamount to treason; and thoseresponsible for such negligenceare most assuredly unworthy of continuance in our Order and should forthwith beexcommunicated.I am not at all certain that I can approve of the “underground” attitudeexpressed by my esteemedBrother, Rev. Frazier. It is recognized, of course, that there are certainselect individuals who may betterserve us if veiled with a cloak of secrecy, but I cannot feel that this is theprerogative of a Priest of theChurch of Satan. The Denver area is certainly not so unique that it will notlisten to logic and reason ifproperly presented by competent authority.Nor do I presume to “toot my own horn” in saying that it is due to my ownwillingness to exposemyself that the Church of Satan has become increasingly acceptable to the massesin this area of thecountry. Neither am I unaware of the several consequences of public exposure,all of which will beimmediately recognizable to Your Excellency.211 Letter, Anton LaVey to the Plutonian Grotto, June 18, VI/1971.212 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino & Wayne West, June 18, VI/1971.- 119 -It is the inherent responsibility of every Satanist, and more especially thePriests of the Church of Satanto constantly and perpetually “set the record straight” by whatever means are athis disposal - or do we havemembers who are unaware of the sometimes necessity for artful deception?The concept of an “underground” and an “aboveground” Grotto is indeed pointlessand can only serveto cause great division in the Church. It would be entirely illogical to assumethat the “underground”membership of such a separate Grotto should be accorded the same dignity andrespect as those who have“put it on the line”, as it were; for such a situation would serve as a seethingoutrage.I also fail to see the reasoning behind Rev. Frazier’s request to establishregional conferences [such asthat currently being planned by Rev. Aquino], since such a conference wouldnecessarily entail openexposure, albeit to a controlled degree, of the membership in the Denver areawhich, at the moment at least,would appear to cherish its secrecy more than life itself. Those who profess to“live and breathe” Satanictheology should do precisely that or accept the slings and arrows of publichysteria.I am aware of the indignities heaped upon Your Excellency as a result of publicexposure, since I havepriorly suffered these same indignities. The forthright presentation of Sataniclogic and reason, however,have lessened the burden to an almost incredible degree; and in this highlyRoman Catholic area of thecountry I continue to be called upon for television, radio, and other publicappearances with greatfrequency. This, then, is the duty of each and every Priest of Satan if he is tobe worthy of the title.There are, I fear, those amongst us who maintain the attitude that we are all“fun and games” and thatour “serious” intent is merely a cover-up for our “nefarious” activities. No,Excellency, I cannot condonethe actions and attitudes of those Plutonians who are interested in nothing morethan being party to an elitelittle astrological society [which I am given to understand on competentauthority is rather much the case]to the detriment of the overall Master Plan of our Order.Your Excellency is fully aware of the training efforts currently being put forthby Rev. Aquino andmyself, and I fail to understand Rev. Frazier’s request that the Churchinstitute special training andindoctrination devices for potential leaders since this is precisely what heshould have been doing all along.While I can appreciate Jill Kirkpatrick’s apparent concern, I am obliged to takeexception to the remarkin her letter that “I personally go along with Adrian’s ideas of an open Grottomade up of people who havenothing to lose”. Each of us who has overtly proclaimed affiliation with theChurch of Satan has lost someaspect of the old life, but each of us has gained through such overtdeclaration.I believe it should be made manifestly clear to Mrs. Kirkpatrick that an avowedPriest of the Church ofSatan probably suffers greater indignities - if he allows himself such suffering- than any other member ofthe Church. It is only through his courage and determination that the Priestsurmounts all obstacles andbecomes acceptable to the public at large.It must appear to Your Excellency that I am exaggeratedly hard and callous inthis matter, but I mustmake bold to say that I find it exceedingly difficult to tolerate any breachtowards your own person and theChurch of Satan. Therefore I can forgive neither Priest nor “commoner” for anysuch breach. And I amhighly intolerant of any action which brings discredit to the Order. 213My own response was to recommend that the Plutonian Grotto designate onespokesman, preferablySteenbarger himself, who should initiate official contact with the local policeand mayors’ offices toestablish the legitimacy and ethics of the Church and its local branch. If theDenver media were already onan anti-Satanism campaign, I reasoned, they would be unlikely to reversethemselves in mid-charge andwould more probably give the Grotto unfavorable coverage. Then in my letter toAnton I turned to themore general issues raised by the incident:I think an additional point might be made here. There is not a single thingwrong with the doctrines orpractices of the Church of Satan. They are often radical from a philosophicalstandpoint, but they are notillegal. If they were, I would not be a member. It is time for our members tostop behaving as though theywere engaged in an illegal activity. If they are ashamed of their membership,then they should damn wellget out. Our work is hard enough without having to carry such “sunshineSatanists” on our backs.213 Letter, Wayne West to Anton LaVey, June 30, VI/1971.- 120 -Privacy is all very well, but there are ways to retain one’s privacy withoutbeing paranoid about it. Myown policy is one of privacy, but I did not hesitate to provide the CommandingGeneral of the ArmorSchool with full data on my activities when official concern was expressed. I’msure there was some ire athigher levels, but my expressed willingness to clarify matters indicated myintegrity. There has been norepercussion whatever, and the Army has respected my right to privacy andfreedom of religion.I doubt that the idea of having two Grottos in Denver would work in the longrun. The “aboveground”Grotto would have to take all the abuse, while both could share in the rewards.No one in his right mindwould join the aboveground group if he could enjoy the same benefits in aprotected environment.I find no grounds to criticize the draft of your open letter to the Plutonianmembership. The point shouldbe made that the Church wasn’t designed to offer anyone a free ride. Those whocan’t endure the heat oughtnot to be so close to Hell, as it were; the good Dr. Buckland offers analternative for the more delicate. 214No further word was forthcoming from either San Francisco or Denver on theNorthglenn Incident,nor did Wayne West and I feel that we need concern ourselves further with itunless asked. [We hadprovided one another with copies of our responses.] I assumed that Anton hadsent his open letter and thatthe Grotto had complied to his satisfaction, for neither Plutonian’s charter norSteenbarger’s Priesthoodwas revoked.The Northglenn Incident brought to the surface the question as to just howadamantly each Satanistwas expected to embrace the philosophy and defend the institution of the Churchof Satan. Shouldeveryone be expected to be as publicly outspoken as Anton LaVey himself? Orshould a member - or evena Priest - be permitted to remain silent and hidden while the reputation of theChurch and of Satan himself"},{"pageContent":"were slandered in public?Wayne West sought to emulate Anton’s own aggressiveness and zeal, and he, likeAnton, managed toride the crest of public opinion quite successfully - at least for the yearduring which he held the SatanicPriesthood. What he failed to emulate was the warmth and sense of humor withwhich Anton LaVey couldcushion even his most “socially shocking” statements. West’s utterance ofSatanic philosophy was ratherlike cold steel; if he had been in Steenbarger’s place, he might well havedispelled the Northglennmisunderstanding about the Church of Satan - but he might have left thecommunity fearing the realitymore than the fantasy. The inescapable difference in numbers between Satanistsand non-Satanists madethis an undesirable option.Charles Steenbarger took the diametrically opposite view - that all the riskswere to be taken by AntonSzandor LaVey. For years I assumed that he and his Grotto had been cured of thisby Anton’s open letter,but as it turned out I was wrong.Worse yet, Anton eventually came to decide that Steenbarger’s neat plan dividingthe Churchmembership into those who were expendable and those who were not was acceptableto him. Theannouncement of this policy, when it came, was perhaps the beginning of the endof the Church of Satan;for those who mounted the barricades felt an increasing disgust for those whoeither feared to do so orwho were considered too “precious” to risk. When the avowed Satanists finallyturned their back on anAnton LaVey who had betrayed them in favor of his “underground” disciples, notone of those disciplesspoke a word or lifted a finger on his behalf - and so it has remained to thisday.Our experiences in Nineveh had taught us that there was a viable middle roadbetween fanaticism andcowardice. That middle road was simply a reasoned approach to the problem ofexplaining and defendinga complex philosophy to a public which could be expected to be curious about it- if somewhatapprehensive about its mythological image. Crucial to our approach was aninherent faith in the desire ofall intelligent humans to understand who and what they are - and what they canbe. And we had learnedthat, to discuss such matters credibly, one must first offer the example ofone’s own state of being. To beor not to be: that is indeed the question.214 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, June 24, VI/1971.[index-121_1.jpg]- 121 -[On January 28, VI/1971 I was invited to participate in a radio talk show onstation WFKY inFrankfort, the Kentucky capital. The program director asked if I would mindhaving a protestant ministeron the show too, and I told him that nothing would please me more. Theprotestant minister turned out tobe one Grayson H. Ensign, Professor at the Cincinnati Bible Seminary. He was apleasant, courteousgentleman, and the radio show was a great success. Soon thereafter the two of usbegan a year-longcorrespondence, and this chapter consists solely of abridged texts of ourletters [with one or twocomments from interested onlookers]. The exchange is included in this volumebecause of its illustrationof the points which tended to surface in comparatively sophisticatedSatanist-Christian dialogues. TheSeminary Review article of Grayson Ensign is included as Appendix #28.]March 3, 1971Dear Michael:Thank you so much for sending me the copy of the Satanic Bible. I haveappreciated your interest andwanting me to have correct information about your organization. This past monthI gave a 45-minutelecture on my encounter with the “church of Satan” and you along with myevaluation. I have been askedto submit this for publication in our Seminary Review and plan to work it up forsuch use. It may well bethat I shall consult with you further about my presentation to be sure that itis accurate.There were about 200 students and faculty in attendance at this afternoon’slecture, which is about thelargest number attending any such lecture that I know of this year. Considerableinterest was shown in thesubject, and no doubt several copies of LaVey’s book have been purchased as aresult.It is still my conviction that you should, as an intelligent and honest person,be committed to biblicaltruth as revealed in Jesus Christ. I do not feel that you really know whatsimply believing and followingJesus Christ can mean to a person’s life. At no point am I interested in tryingto get you to belong to some“other church” or follow some creedal, institutional form of religion. I wouldlike for you to seriouslyconfront Jesus Christ and His claims. Others who have done this have found aworld-view that is not onlysatisfying but systematically consistent.Grayson H. Ensign* * *March 9, VIDear Grayson:I was most pleased to hear that your lecture on the Church of Satan was sosuccessful, and I wouldvery much like to obtain a copy of the Seminary Review containing yourpresentation. We are quiteinterested in the public’s opinion of our Church, and we have often found thatthe most erudite criticismsof our theories come from our theological opponents. But then this is as itshould be. If the contestbetween the Church of Satan and the various Christian/monotheist sects servesonly to refine the- 122 -philosophies of both, the time will have been well-spent. It is the essence ofAmerican democracy that oneshould always have an alternative to consider - and we are certainly that!I respect your admiration for the philosophies of Jesus Christ. I personallyregard him as a mostuncommon man, whose understanding of human psychology ranks with that ofSocrates, Marcus Aurelius,and Nietzsche. According to our theory of the cycles of Fire and Ice, Christ wasas necessary to socialevolution as were the Classical philosophers who preceded him and the Romantics,Materialists, andExistentialists who followed him.We consider the psychological evolution of man to be a dialectic process, i.e. asynthesis resultingfrom the effective resolution of a thesis and its antithesis. We perceive ourfunction quite literally as thatof “Devil’s advocate” in that we hound the self-righteous and the pompous,particularly if they are in aposition to halt human progress by dictating a fixed ethical or moral code.The institutions of Catholicism, for example, were important devices forpreserving the Mediterraneanheritage throughout the middle ages. Many of history’s finest artists andscholars [Aquinas?!] were able tosustain their talents through church patronage, etc. But other, more efficientmedia are now available, andthe Christian institution now acts to retard innovation and to censor radicalopinion. Hence we of theChurch of Satan feel it has outlived its social usefulness.I should like to quote a bit from the Aristos of John Fowles, whose views onChristianity coincide withmy own:Intelligent Athenians of the fifth century knew their gods were metaphors,personifications offorces and principles. There are many signs that the athenianization ofChristianity has begun. Thesecond coming of Christ will be the realization that Jesus of Nazareth wassupremely human, notsupremely divine; but this will be to relegate him to the ranks of thephilosophers and to reduce thevast apparatus of ritual, church, and priesthood to an empty shell.The Christian churches, contrary to the philosophy of Jesus himself, havefrequently madetheir own self-continuance their chief preoccupation. They have fosteredpoverty, or indifference toit; they have forced people to look beyond life; they have abused the childishconcept of hell andhell-fire; they have supported reactionary temporal powers; they have condemnedcountlessinnocent pleasures and bred centuries of bigotry; they have set themselves up asrefuges and toooften taken good care that outside their doors refuge shall be needed. Thingsare better now; butwe have not forgotten that things were not better until history presented thechurches with a clearchoice: reform or die.Jesus was human. Perhaps he believed he was all that he claimed to be; but thathe was not allthat he claimed to be is trivial, not vital, because he was human; and becausethe essence of histeaching does not depend upon his divinity.Humanity is like a tall building. It needs stage after stage of scaffolding.Religion afterreligion, philosophy after philosophy; one cannot build the twentieth floor fromthe scaffolding ofthe first. The great religions prevent the Many from looking and thinking. Theworld would not atonce become a happier place if they looked and they thought; but this is nodefense of dogmaticreligions.Religious faith: mystery. Rational faith: law. The fundamental nature of realityis mysterious -this is a scientific fact. In basing themselves on mystery, religions are morescientific than rationalphilosophies. But there are mysteries and mysteries; and Christianity hasfoolishly tried toparticularize the fundamental mystery … The church has introduced a fairgroundof pseudo-mysteries, which have no relation to the truth, but only to the truth thatmystery has power.For every Christian who believes in all the dogma of his church, there are athousand who half-believe because they feel a man should believe in something. If the oldreligions survive, it isbecause they are convenient receptacles of the desire to believe; and becausethey are, though poorones, ports; and because they at least try to satisfy the hunger for mystery.- 123 -I reject Christianity, along with the other great religions. Most of itsmysteries are remote fromthe true mystery. Though I admire the founder, though I admire many priests andmany Christians,I despise the church. It is because men want to be good and do good that it hassurvived so long;like communism, it is inherently parasitical on a deeper and more mysteriousnobility in man thanany existing religion or political creed can satisfy. 215Michael A. Aquino* * *March 12, VIDear Michael:A brief treatise to express my appreciation for your courtesy in furnishing mewith copies of yourrecent correspondence with Ensign. He seems determined to convert you! I shan’t,however, hold mybreath until he meets with success.Wayne F. West* * *May 20, 1971Dear Michael:As a beginning in an effort to contribute something to your thinking, I amassuming that you arewilling to give some serious consideration to the claims of Jesus to being yourMaster and Saviour. Inother words, I am not interested in playing word games or debating fordebating’s sake. As an intelligentperson, I believe you owe it to yourself to thoughtfully consider this person.Yes, I am sure that you haveconsidered something about him and have read either about him or have read theaccounts of the gospel inthe New Testament scriptures. But I am wondering whether you have really gone inany depth into thisstudy. This is the observation of Canon J.B. Phillips in his book Ring of Truth:Over the years I have had hundreds of conversations with people, many of them ofhigherintellectual calibre than my own, who quite obviously had no idea of whatChristianity is reallyabout. I was in no case trying to catch them out: I was simply and gently tryingto find out whatthey knew about the New Testament. My conclusion was that they knew virtuallynothing. This Ifind pathetic and somewhat horrifying. It means that the most important Event inhuman history ispolitely and quietly bypassed. For it is not as though the evidence had beenexamined and foundunconvincing: it had simply never been examined.But the central apologetic for clearing the way for supreme confidence in andcommitment to Jesus asthe Saviour and Lord, worthy of your total submission to, is simply Jesushimself. You wrote that yourespected my admiration for the philosophies of Jesus Christ. I do heartilyaccept the teaching of Jesus,but even more I accept him! Jesus in his teaching did not point to a philosophicsystem or a way of life.He pointed to himself as the perfect example for all men in all time to emulate.Salvation from self and sinis bound up and inseparable with the acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Saviour.There is no halfway here inJesus’ demands. It is accepting him for what he claimed to be - the unique Sonof God - and not anacceptance of some of his precepts. The precepts are null and void if he is aliar.Grayson H. Ensign* * *May 26, VIDear Grayson:Canon Phillips makes a valid point. There are a number of conceited individualswhose academically-nurtured egos are so over-inflated that they cannot recognize their intellectualimperfections. The mind of215 Fowles, John, The Aristos. Boston: Little, Brown, 1964, extracts fromChapter 7/Christianity.- 124 -man is still in its infancy, which is why we must refer to axioms, theories, andassumptions instead of totruth. We “know” nothing; ours is a universe of suspicion.Because the assumptions of the Church of Satan are perhaps the most audacious todate, we take agreat deal of interest in the measurement of our ignorance. We will not ordain aPriest who has not spent aconsiderable length of time studying the religious documents of the world. ASatanist can qualify for thePriesthood only after a conscientious rejection of all religions.Although I am always interested in new ideas - or in novel approaches to oldones - I should make itclear that I am not in search of a “savior” in any sense of the word. Even Satanhimself - as awesome as heis - is not a surrogate. The Satanist does not accept the concept of originalsin; hence he feels no need ofsalvation. This is one of the reasons why we are disposed to consider JesusChrist as a benevolentegomaniac rather than a god.Here lies the focus of our difference: All religious systems, Christianityincluded, advocate a certainstandard of conduct as dictated by a non-human agency, a god or gods. Now ifsuch a precept were nottrue, all proponents of the theology in question would be ridiculous hypocrites.This is why it is sodifficult for one form of theism to coexist with another: one of them isdeluded! You will find interfaithcouncils and legal toleration as sheer necessities of existence, but you’llnever get a Baptist, a Mormon,and a Roman Catholic to agree on anything - except perhaps on how horrible theChurch of Satan is.This, as I see it, is the reason why it is so difficult for many theologians todiscuss principles with me -or other Satanists - without making a determined effort to convert us. If youwere to accept the rationale ofSatanism as being of equal stature with your own creed, you would in fact bestriking a blow against theexclusive doctrines of Christianity.Satanism, like many of the old pagan systems, is not a fixed disposition. Werecognize both the meritsand the influence of the world’s many religions. We also recognize theirimperfections. We as individualshave no need for religion in the traditional sense, but we have no reason toforce others to our way ofthinking. If we did, we should fall into the same category as the theists. Thenwe should be the greatest ofhypocrites, and we would have no true mandate to title ourselves Satanists.Satan himself, it may interest you to know, bears no grudge against Christiansor other theists for theirbeliefs. He recognizes that such pursuits are beneficial for many persons, andthat religion has played anessential role in man’s psychological evolution. The only Christian who needfear the Prince of Darknessis the hypocrite.Michael A. Aquino* * *June 15, VIDear Michael:We have greatly enjoyed your correspondence with Prof. Ensign. If I were he, Ithink I’d go crawl intoa hole after receiving your reaction to the grim prospect of “salvation”. Yourealize, of course, that witharguments such as you have set forth in your letters it could completely destroyhim. But don’t lose toomuch sleep over it, for I doubt that he would accept the enlightenment you haveoffered him. That you canwrite just as wrathful a letter as Rev. West once your dander is up we no longerhave any doubts! We doappreciate your indignation over his apparent attempt to minimize our status byrather snide means, suchas referring to the Church in quotation marks, and we thank you for setting himstraight and for showingpride in your Priestly position.Diane LaVey* * *July 30, 1971Dear Michael:Commenting upon your letter of May 26 and thoughts expressed, let me say that ifwe “know”nothing, then all communication would cease. Granted that we know very little;yet if we do not know(recognize as valid) the law of contradiction, then there is no communicationpossible. Also if we are- 125 -totally without the knowledge [or are totally skeptical about the existence] oftruth, then all striving wouldcease. There would be nothing to learn, no goal for intellectual effort.The fact that we do not have “the truth” as individual men and can only strivefor it with little hope ofever securing it would seem to point to the fundamental need of a higher sourceof truth, a revelation oftruth.If there is an Ultimate Reality, a spirit whether Jehovah or Satan, such a beingcould disclose the truetruth, thus giving us a standard or a means of evaluating our feeble thoughtsand feelings after truth. Ifthere is a “good, ethical Spirit” such as Jehovah, then it would seem to bebelievable and logical to believethat, having created us, he would also give us his wisdom.If, as you say, Satan is the only real spirit, then in his a-moral or whateverstate he either might giveman a malevolent (false) word for the very fun of seeing man destroyed, or mightgive man a “right way”to go because he really is a good spirit, just misunderstood and maligned bystupid Christians.No doubt this will have to be discussed at greater length, because it is of themost critical importance.Is there truth anywhere available? If so, how do you get it or know when youhave it? My answer, ofcourse, is that there is truth, that it comes from God’s disclosure of himselfthrough the inspired scripturesand through his creation (nature) which men made in the image of God, endowedwith the qualities ofGod in a finite degree - intelligence, will, personality, morality - candiscover, unfold, and reason aboutwith increasing understanding. What do you say on the subject?I would not agree that “ours is a universe of suspicion” but rather that itoperates by faith. Its faultyoperation is the fault of suspicion and guilt on the part of fallen (sinful) menand the lack of faith both inGod and in other men. Perhaps, as you see it, the universe is of suspicion. Ifso, how do we get out of it orovercome suspicion, because it would seem impossible to live fruitfully, happilyin a state of suspicion.You are coming through loud and clear when you say that you are not in search ofa “savior”. Doesthis mean that you have no sense of “guilt”, failing to be all that you ought tobe, no sense of inadequacy,nor any gnawing of conscience? Are you living a “perfect” life?A young man in your condition in life may very well feel that there is noproblem of evil [just a matterof words], no moral judgments now or hereafter, and that you are your ownsavior, that is, you are takingcare of yourself utterly without the need of anyone else. This does not meanthat this is a good or even atrue condition.Yes, maybe it could be that way. There is at least a 50-50 chance that yourpresent conviction that youneed no “savior” is not only wrong but dreadfully, tragically wrong. Does thisseem a possibility to you?As I write, I am conscious that I am having to write to the Michael A. Aquinowho may be living ayear or a decade from now, when the bright bloom of the youthful twenties hasbegun to fade or somecrushing experiences or some honest intellectual effort has opened you up tosome need of not only a“savior” but the Savior that so many have found so satisfying. [Honestintellectual effort does not meanthat I think you are not honest intellectually now. I mean by further anddetermined reasoning on thesevital issues.]Maybe in some small way I could be used to provoke or stimulate you to areexamination of ultimaterealities. If not, the effort is still worth while, and if that day should comewhen you might thinkdifferently, you might recall that you have a fellow who is your friend.Grayson H. Ensign* * *August 11, VIDear Grayson:Because the Satanist rejects any one standard of truth, he is not deprived of areason for existence. Yousuggest that, if Satan is the only real spirit, he would pronounce truth for us.Were he to do so, he wouldbe merely a God with cloven hooves. He would have had no reason to divorcehimself from the Universehad he been a proponent of order. He has told us that we have the power todecide our own truth - and that- 126 -recklessness in this regard is quite capable of destroying us as a race. Hewould not see this happen, but hewill not admit the failure of his Gift by stepping in to solve our problems forus.Of course no Priest of Mendes would inquire of the Prince of Darkness whether hewere speakingtruth! He would receive only a smile, as Satan’s own answer would be pointless.But, when he does speak,he never seeks refuge in ambiguity. He promises nothing to his disciples but theburden of intellectualindependence, and he is not interested in coaxing the unwilling. He desires tonurture and improve man’ssense of personality, to see man raised to subjective godhead by the power thathe has given him.If you should ever witness his presence, you will see for yourself a majestythat shames the impetuousand goal-oriented claims of Jesus Christ. Satan needs no such trappings as thecathedrals, adorations, andaphorisms of Christianity; his own chapels have ever been the field, the forest,and the seashore; and thesilence of the evening continues to grace our communion with the one being whohas never used man forhis own pleasures.But this is something you may only discover for yourself.Of course I have a conscience. I am imperfect and make mistakes. Having done so,I resolve not tomake the same error twice. I feel no guilt for my human condition - only anirritation at my imperfect state- and I would be inclined to seek the pardon of the wronged party only.The “bright bloom of the youthful twenties” is perhaps not so bright as you maysuppose. Vietnam hasa way of aging one very quickly. I am a cynic and a thorough pessimist, and whenthings go well of theirown accord I am pleasantly surprised. The Church of Satan provides media forfantastic escapism underritual conditions, but it also demands impassive realism from all of itsmembers.And now may I add one of my own favorite quotes - from H.L. Mencken:The liberation of the human mind has never been furthered by dunderheads; it hasbeenfurthered by gay fellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries and then wentroistering down thehighways of the world, proving to all men that doubt, after all, was safe - thatthe god in thesanctuary was finite in his power and hence a fraud. One horselaugh is worth tenthousandsyllogisms. It is not only more effective; it is also vastly more intelligent.Michael A. Aquino* * *August 19, VIDear Michael:I have received and digested [with the help of a gentle purgative] the essay ofProf. Ensign and havedecided that, despite the commission his appellation implies, he is but anOrdinary Seaman floundering inthe troubled seas of christendom. His patronizing attitude, implying you to bean apple-cheeked youthwho has been led astray by a Fieldsian humbug, does little to conceal his ownbitterness at not havinggiven himself the opportunity to savor the hot taste of life. Your comments tohim are superb and wouldindicate to an objective observer that you have lived one hundred years to eachof his. I’m afraid anyfurther discourse with him will be wasted, however, except to give him respitefrom that which Thomsonexpresses so well:The hours are heavy on him and the days;The burden of the months he scarce can bear;And often in his secret soul he praysTo sleep through barren periods unaware,Arousing at some longed-for date of pleasure;Which having passed and yielded him small treasure,He would outsleep another term of care. 216216 Thomson, James, The City of Dreadful Night. London: Arthur Dobell, 1922,Verse XIII.- 127 -Your conversion is his challenge; that is obvious. The creative activity youdirect towards him onlykeeps him afloat a little longer while depleting your own productivity. Shouldyou win him over, he wouldmost likely backslide as soon as the going got rough. He knows he is washed upand wants desperately todance to our tune, but his feet won’t let him. My final comment on Prof. Ensignis that if we had fourhundred thousand dollars at this time to work with, he would really havesomething to worry about!Anton Szandor LaVey* * *February 18, 1972Dear Michael:Your boss’ letter to you in response to my article was interesting. He appearsto think of himself as aclever and really cute fellow, it seems. He must be an egomaniac reallyfar-gone. His remarks are more orless what I would expect from a grown-up son of the Devil. [Refer to the Gospelaccording to John 8:44.]As far as our understandings of one another’s world-view and doctrine, I supposethat we haveachieved that. My recent letters have been principally efforts at challengingthe epistemological basis ofyour system of thought, the question of knowledge, truth, and reason. Yourreplies indicate confidence inempirically-based knowledge, which I contend is illogical because it is withoutobjective foundation andunrelated to any absolute.This seems to me to be an indispensable point to be honestly and thoroughlyfaced if we shouldcontinue the discussion. My contention is that you, from your materialistic,naturalistic basis, haveeffectively destroyed the possibility of genuine reasoning and intelligence. Youhave something - mind -coming from nothing. You have the rational coming from the irrational ornon-rational. Thus there is nosuch reality as “truth” or “error”. They must be, in your system, equal andmeaningless. Mindless reflexescan’t study with meaning anything. Deduction and induction depend upon truthsomewhere, or they haveno more value than the notion that a chicken with its head cut off is makingEuclidean geometry.No doubt this is difficult for you to see, and if you ever “see” it, you willbegin to change yourconfidence in your present world-view. I think you are smart enough to see thisand to fight back witheverything at your command. I affirm that you can’t overthrow the philosophicalreasoning and that youmust logically slip and slide into skepticism, nihilism, and despair.Grayson H. Ensign* * *February 23, VIIDear Grayson:Well, Anton LaVey certainly seems to have touched your vital nerve! But then hehas an unusual skillfor that sort of thing, which partially explains his office. If yourcharacterization of his behavior derivesfrom John 8:44, then you apparently consider him a liar and a murderer. Thisstrikes me as a rather violentreaction against someone who merely suggested that you were depriving yourselfof life’s manifoldpleasures.Let us total up the score to date: Dr. LaVey has referred to you [in a privatecommunication addressedonly to myself] as a spiritual masochist. You have publicly - in the Reviewarticle - denounced him asbeing a fraud and a charlatan and have now further identified him as a liar anda murderer, neither ofwhich he happens to be. Frankly, Grayson, it seems to me as though the Church ofSatan and its HighPriest have treated you with extraordinary courtesy and restraint.And as for John 8:44, I can’t help remembering that God’s first admonition toAdam - that he woulddie if he were to eat of the fruit of knowledge - proved to be a lie. You canseek refuge in allegory, Isuppose, but the moment you take that step the whole Bible runs like an oldsock.It should be clear to you that I am uninterested in Jesus Christ, havingdismissed his philosophy asillogical. I have no wish to offend your own obsession with him insofar as itbrings you personal pleasure.- 128 -Naturally, if you make conjectural assertions, I will answer them to the best ofmy ability. But I have nodesign to convert you, nor does our High Priest - who was speaking in conjectureonly.For that matter it is impossible for me to argue raw philosophy with you, as weboth speak fromdifferent premises of what constitutes admissible evidence. You feel a real needfor an absolute truth, forexample, so you seize upon the Bible as an axiom. I feel no such need, beingcontent with workingassumptions based upon personal observations. If you had been born in Iran, nodoubt you’d be beatingme over the head with the Koran. Semantics are subordinate to the rootdisposition.Michael A. Aquino* * *February 25, 1972Dear Michael:Congratulations to you on your elevation to a superior position (MagisterCaverni IV°) in your church.On a strictly human and morally neutral plane, I offer congratulations, for, asyou know, on the basis ofmy commitment to _______ I would express a different evaluation.First as to LaVey: I suppose it was useless to make any comment about him, as Imight have foreseenthat any comment of mine would be used against me. I don’t know your motive inintroducing a quotationfrom him into our correspondence. I am sure that you knew it would beprovocative. I judged his remarksto be an asinine attempt to be funny and also false in fact. So I repliedwithout humor (which seems tocause us problems) as I felt his remarks deserved. Your suggestion for me to geta ghostwriter for levity isreturned to you for LaVey with interest.You extrapolate from my reference to John 8:44 that I “have identified [LaVey]as a liar and amurderer”. From my position and in response to the man’s judgments, I considerhim to be false and lying- as to the nature and authority of Jesus Christ and as to his knowledge of me.The words “your father theDevil … was a murderer from the beginning” are interpreted by most scholars toindicate the“murder” (death) of Adam and Eve in their spiritual separation from the God andFather. Insofar as you orLaVey are responsible for the spiritual separation of persons from the love andlife of God, you will beheld guilty in the judgment of God of doing the “deeds of your father” -murdering souls. This is myconviction, though you do not share it.You and LaVey are just as able as I am [or any other believer is] in speakingyour mind aboutfalsehood, lying, etc. You state bold blasphemies and outrageous, unproved, andunprovable assertionsagainst God and Jesus Christ - “your impotent mad redeemer … the true prince ofevil - the king of theslaves”. This is your freedom, but there have been few, even among unbelieversin Jesus as the Son ofGod who have not acknowledged the values, the morals, and the ideals of theteaching of Jesus. Men ofthe recognized stature of Spinoza, Rousseau, Goethe, Strauss, Renan, and evenThomas Paine, who said,“… nothing that is here said can apply even with the most distant disrespect tothe real character of JesusChrist.”So you men in the Church of Satan are a very small and unique minority evenamong skeptics andunbelievers of all kinds. Again that is your privilege, and maybe it is yourpride. But none of you shouldbe startled or cut up when someone boldly returns your blatant attack upon thegreatest Person who everlived in plain words of refutation or denunciation. You hesitate not to speak inthe most terrible termsabout One who claimed to be the unique Son of God. You don’t even claim such aunique nature orposition. You are mere men, finite, sinful, proud, evil like the rest of us.Paul declares my position: “… letGod be true, but every man a liar …“ (Romans 3:4). In other words God, thesource of all truth, cannot lie,cannot be mistaken, but you and I can be.You call God a liar in regard to Adam and the statement of Jehovah to him “… forin the day that youeat from it you shall surely die” (Genesis 2:17). You declare that “this proveda lie”. You forgot to followone of the elementary rules of hermeneutics which says “keep on reading”. InGenesis 5:5 it is clearlystated, “so all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, andhe died.” So youraccusation against God is itself a lie, a falsehood just as most of the allegedcontradictions against the- 129 -Bible are. These have been known so long by both believers and unbelievers thatthey are moth-eaten andunworthy of intellectually honest people. [Note: I thought God told Adam hewould croak “in the day thatyou eat from it” - M.A.A.]This brings us to the nitty-gritty of both this letter and the correspondence.Since you do not want meto “beat you over the head with the Koran” - in my case the Bible - I amsincerely trying to find out whatreasons, what rational arguments you have against biblical Christianity andprincipally the truth and ethicsof Jesus Christ. I teach apologetics in the Seminary, and I want not to dealwith “straw men” or with weakarguments, but with the strongest and most modern arguments against theworld-view that I stand for asthe best, most coherent, and satisfying of world-views. I figure that you cancome as close as anyone inmy circle just now in stating these “logical, smashing arguments”. You statethat you “are uninterested inJesus Christ, having dismissed his philosophy as illogical”. Would you be sokind as to state the specificillogical positions presented by Jesus Christ? This, I feel, would be valuable.This would bring us to theconfrontation as to who has the truth and who is in error. What is yourepistemology? How do you knowtruth, validate it, and build a logical world-view upon it?I would really like to see it on paper.Now you may have no time or interest in this subject, but I think it is at thebedrock of our thinkingand lives as intelligent human beings. At the moment, and sticking my neck out,so to speak, I don’tbelieve that you have anything more than a shifting-sand foundation for yourlogical structure and henceyour life. From my position I can only conclude that you must believephilosophically that life “… is atale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”, that withBertrand Russell you must live alife of “confident despair”.The possibility of truth, its nature and source seem to me to be of the utmostimportance to any validdiscussion of opposing world views. Without some agreement here, all is illusionand of no moreimportance than making sand castles on the beach with the tide coming in.Grayson H. Ensign* * *June 10, VIIDear Grayson:This will be my final letter to you, as I have been recalled to the west coast.It has been a highlysatisfactory stay in this area for me; our membership has continued to mushroom,and Kentucky hasrevoked those monopolistic “blue laws” that prohibited businesses other thanreligious ones fromoperating on Sundays. Now the citizens will have a free choice of entertainment.It may amuse you toknow that more than one of your evangelistic colleagues have, over Louisville’sBible-jock radio station,condemned the Kentucky governor and the entire legislature to Hell for theirheinous decision. Well, weshall do our best to make them welcome!After re-reading your letter of February 25, I am of the opinion that we areagain talking in circles.Your assumption is that the Christian Bible defines truth, and I do not acceptthis premise. Thus yourreasoning, though sincere, impresses me as being fantastic. As for the argumentsI have presented onbehalf of Satanism, they seem to have been regarded with selective inattention.And since the Age ofSatan has come and that of Christ has ended, an extended argument between us isacademic. Satan, mydear Grayson, gazes at you from the eyes of your most brilliant students.When all is said and done, I believe that you have done your best - according toyour beliefs - toencourage kindness and consideration among men. In this you are at odds withyour parent institution, butyou may be closely akin to the real Jesus Christ - not the Son of God, but asimple, mortal humanitarianwho lived in an era of misery and callousness. On behalf of the Church of Satan,I wish you a very happylife.Michael A. Aquino- 130 -[index-131_1.jpg]- 131 -The Zohar (Leviticus 19a) describes Lilith as “a hot, fiery female who at firstcohabited with man” but,when Eve was created, “flew to the cities of the sea coast”, where she is “stilltrying to ensnare mankind”.She is represented as a naked woman whose body terminates in a serpent’s tail.Gustav Davidson, A Dictionary of AngelsLilith: Hebrew female devil, Adam’s first wife, who taught him the ropes.Anton Szandor LaVey, The Satanic BibleOf all the Grottos of the Church of Satan, none was larger, more enduring, ormore influential in thehistory of the Church than the one in New York City which bore the name of itsfounder and leader, LilithSinclair. Lilith was not an old friend of Anton LaVey’s as was CharlesSteenbarger, nor was she anunusually favored newcomer as was the case with Wayne West and myself. Duringall the years of herGrotto Leadership, in fact, she received only one letter from Anton - a get-wellnote during a criticalhospital stay. She did not have a scholarly or religious background inphilosophy or theology; heracquaintance with Judæo/Christianity was simply through her experiences at aCatholic high school inPittsburgh.It was at that school that she grew to feel an increasing and finally consumingrevulsion for thetwisted, humiliating, and preposterous doctrines that all of the children wereforce-fed [and physicallypunished if they resisted]. The environment finally became so intolerable to herthat she left the schoolprior to graduation. In 1969 she set out on her own for New York City, hoping tobecome a fashion model.She enrolled in New York’s Barbizon Modeling School, earning her tuition andsupplementing herstudent modeling assignments by pressing dolls’ clothes in a toy factory for $37a week and living in aboarding room slightly larger than a walk-in closet. She was both beautiful andpoised enough to securemany good modeling prospects after completing the school, and she followed hernew professionsuccessfully for the next year. She soon learned, however, that in order tosecure any but the mosttemporary assignments she would have to do more for clients than pose.Unprepared for this aspect ofhigh fashion, she turned her back on Fifth Avenue, secured a realtor’s licenseat night school, andsupported herself full-time by secretarial work. And in 1971 she decided tobring the Church of Satan toNew York City.Lilith contacted the Central Grotto for addresses of local members-at-large, andthen she wrote toinvite them to a pilot Grotto meeting at her apartment in Spotswood, New Jersey.At 9:00 PM on Saturday,June 5, VI A.S./1971, the future Lilith Grotto gathered for the first time.[Somewhat apprehensive as to“what sort of people there might be in the Church of Satan”, Lilith arranged forone of her girl friends tobe on hand as well!] A compassion ritual per the guidelines in the Satanic Biblewas conducted by Lilithand Spencer Waldron, who together with other first-timers William Van Ness andStuart Jay Levine wereto form the backbone of the new Grotto. Of them Lilith reported to 6114:- 132 -I’m not sure what to make of Mr. Levine. He sat in a chair at the far end of theroom and didn’t say aword. Spencer Waldron spoke to him a bit, but as far as I can tell he seemedtotally apart from the groupand made no effort to mix with them. I’d like to observe him a bit more; perhapshe just needs to be drawnout a little.Mr. Van Ness has one beautiful ego and held forth on various subjects. He hadseveral ideas andsuggestions and comments to offer. He is also a go-getter and made his ritualrobe and hood by hand. At theend of the meeting he most generously presented our group with his ceremonialsword.Needless to say, Spencer Waldron is the backbone of the group and has been myleft-hand in thisundertaking. I cannot praise his assistance and dedication adequately. Hesupplied us with all of theequipment for our rituals and will not hesitate to help with any request or taskif he is able. He is a trueSatanist in every sense of the word, and I consider him most valuable to ourgroup and hold him in thehighest regard.I feel we shall have no problem developing into a well-functioning Grotto. Witha little hard work andinitiative, we could very well surpass our goals in much less time thananticipated. 217By July the new Grotto had succeeded in exploiting its members financially, asreported by Lilith toSan Francisco: “We now have $4.20 in our treasury, donated by the members at themeeting, and it will beused to purchase one of the many pieces of equipment needed for our Grotto.” 218Lilith also had somecomments concerning another new arrival, Mike McQuown:He is a friend of Mr. Van Ness’ who has applied for membership. He entersdiscussions enthusiasticallyand is quite intelligent. After observing him I feel that his tendency to beblasé and familiar is notintentional and that he is not aware of giving this impression. Once brought tohis attention, this situationshould resolve itself. I’ll follow this up.219The Grotto was chartered in October, and Lilith wrote its Halloweenconsecration:Hear me, O mighty legions of the Pit! Draw near and bear witness as we dedicateto His InfernalMajesty a new temple of truth. May our beacon of enlightenment cast a flood ofbrilliance over thebenumbed minds of those who have been blinded by the white light religionistswho would make them assheep. Look with favor upon our brothers and sisters of the Left-Hand Path, andaid with silent might ourdetermination that this Grotto shall stand as a sign of the Powers of Darknessand a tribute to the majestyand might of Satan, our Dark Lord and King of Hell!220In the years to come the Lilith Grotto would become quite prominent in themedia, gaining Lilithherself photographic inclusion in Time magazine and a journalistic accolade as“occult superstar of theeast”. Her first interview, however, took place on November 2 of VI/1971 on NewYork’s WCBStelevision, and a transcript of that memorable occasion has survived:Jim Jensen: Today we continue our five-part series of special reports entitled“Witchcraft andSatanism”, but before we do, here’s a short glossary: A witch is any man orwoman who believes he hasmagic powers and does practice witchcraft. White witch: One who uses his allegedpowers only for good.Black witch: One who sometimes uses his alleged powers to harm others. Satan:Well, we all know abouthim. Satanism: The ancient worship of Satan and evil for the purpose ofimproving one’s wealth, power,and pleasure. The Church of Satan: A 20th-century revival of Satanism known toits members as the217 Sinclair, Lilith, Lilith Grotto Report, June 5, VI/1971.218 Ibid., July 31, VI/1971.219 Ibid.220 Sinclair, Lilith, Invocation for the Consecration of the Lilith Grotto,October VI/1971.- 133 -religion of the flesh. Grotto: Used to describe both the place of worship andthe group of worshippers in theChurch of Satan. Destruction ceremony: Ritual of the Church of Satan to bringharm to an enemy.Bob Young: Today’s Satan worshippers, like their medieval counterparts, make nobones about theirbeliefs and intentions. They want and are out to get self-satisfactionphysically and spiritually, and theymake no judgments about others who do the same thing. If their critics call thatevil, Satanists reply that it isman’s natural behavior, held too long in check by traditional religious notionsof self-denial and turning theother cheek. Lilith is the acting Priestess of the Church of Satan for the NewYork area. She prefers not tobe seen on camera. [Note: She appeared in silhouette.] She’s a former New Yorkmodel, now a suburbanworking mother, and the name “Lilith” is adopted from the lore of witchcraft. Itwas she who allowed thisfilming of portions of a simulated destruction ritual - a ritual of vengeance onthose who have harmedmembers of the Church. Had a complete ceremony been filmed, members believe thepowers of Satanicdemons could be unleashed. In a ritual members also believe they can directpowers to their own ends.Lilith: We develop a concentration in our will. We beam it; we do regular mentalexercises. When thegroup is together, we all focus on a single thought to generate as much energyand concentration as we can.Young: The Satanic beaming of willpower to injure someone is a perversion of thenormal religiousidea of praying. In the middle ages, when it was founded, Satanism gainedsupport from those disenchantedby the harshness of early Christianity. In those days the carnal nature ofSatanism attracted many fallenpriests who could no longer tolerate celibacy. Today some members of this Grottoare practicing priests andministers. Several are ex-Catholics, all of whom say the religion of Satan hashelped them rid themselves ofguilt feelings about sex and avarice.Lilith: If a Satanist does certain things; if he or she feels there’s nothingwrong with it, then for thatperson it’s not wrong.Young: The religion also helps members cope with feelings of anger andvengeance.Lilith: Perhaps we want someone to suffer migraine headaches or to have chronicthroat or back troubleor mental torture, sleepless nights … that sort of thing. He will have no restuntil he has rectified what hehas done or until he leaves us alone if he has been antagonizing us. If someoneharms us, we strike backthree times as hard. And he’ll think twice before doing it again.Young: Does it go as far as killing someone or wishing someone to be killed?Lilith: Yes, it can and it has - not in my Grotto, but I know of instances … Iknow of one definiteinstance in which it is true, but of course I can’t tell you the details.221Young: For success in love, Satanists have yet another ritual. I understand thatsome of the Grottoservices are conducted in the nude. Why is that?Lilith: The only Grotto service conducted in the nude is the private lustritual, when you are the onlyperson there. And this is done at approximately four in the morning, when thesubject’s mind is mostsusceptible, right before waking. If the subject were present, you wouldn’t haveto do a lust ritual - sinceyou’d have the actual person. 222Another part of the television interview had focused on “white witches” or“Wiccans”, of whom themost prominent at the time was a Long Islander by the name of Raymond Buckland.The Church of Satan had not paid too much attention to the Wiccan movement todate, save for AntonLaVey’s passing comments in the Satanic Bible and Cloven Hoof that playing theDevil’s game whiledenying the Devil’s name was merely another form of quasi-Christian self-deceit.The Wiccans reacted to Anton’s barbs about as calmly as Professor Ensign, withthe result thatvirtually every statement, article, and book subsequently issued by a Wiccan had(a) an inevitabledisclaimer that “witchcraft is not Satanism!”, and (b) an equally inevitablepassage or chapter detailing the“shocking” facts about said Satanism - ostensibly to warn the reader away fromit, but also to help sell anotherwise bland article or book.221 Lilith was referring to the by-then-legendary Sam Brody Curse of AntonLaVey.222 Transcript of interview, “Witchcraft and Satanism”, WCBS-TV S ix O’ClockReport, October 29, VI/1971.- 134 -Raymond Buckland was the chief proponent of what is generally termed “GardnerianWicca”, beingthe blend of white witchcraft formulated and espoused by an Englishman by thename of Gerald Gardner(1884-1964 CE). After his retirement from the Malayan customs service in 1936,Gardner becameincreasingly interested in current occult movements. He advanced to the VII° ofAleister Crowley’sO.T.O., but, according to Francis King, he finally decided that he preferredprimitive paganism toMasonic/ Tantric symbolism. King comments:He accordingly hired Crowley, at a generous fee, to write elaborate rituals forthe new “Gardnerian”witch-cult and, at about the same time, either forged or procured to be forgedthe so-called Book ofShadows, allegedly a 16th-century witches’ rule book but betraying its modernorigins in every line of itsunsatisfactory pastiche of Elizabethan English.223King further observes that Gardner’s version of Wicca was heavilysadomasochistic, with scourgingand ritual sex incorporated into the ceremonies and most particularly the “GreatRite” between a coven’shigh priest and priestess. Raymond Buckland’s account of Wicca on the WCBS-TVshow, however, wasnot quite so colorful:Witches meet in a circle which, by tradition, is nine feet in diameter. There isan altar in the center ofthat circle. For the initiation, the initiate is then brought in and stoodoutside the circle, and the first half ofthe initiation is the challenge. There’s this very stern-faced young womanpointing a sword directly at himand asking “Do you really want to go through with this?”. There will be anexchange of words, and then hewill be blindfolded and bound and taken into the circle in a certain way and ledaround to the four cardinalpoints to be presented to the gods. He eventually ends up in front of the altar,kneeling, to take the oath ofsecrecy. And this is just an oath of secrecy. It’s a promise to keep the secretsof the craft. There is norepudiation of a previous religion. There are no crosses to spit upon or trampleinto the dust. There are nogoat buttocks to kiss. 224Buckland discussed his “Museum of Witchcraft and Magick”. Their curiosityaroused, the LilithGrotto visited it in December. Lilith’s report to San Francisco was somethingless than enthusiastic:The first reaction one experiences upon entering Mr. Buckland’s museum is: “Youmean to tell me Icame all the way out here for this?” The exhibits, such as they are, arecontained in a two-story, weather-worn house that has seen better days. The floors are bare, dirty wood; the wallsare dingy and badly in needof paint. The very first thing one encounters is a display case full of“genuine” Wicca charms, cards,amulets, and lapel buttons (“I did a ‘spell’ at the Buckland Museum”) - all ofwhich, of course, are for sale.Magazine and newspaper clippings are all over the walls, the main subject beingMr. Buckland himself.Tacked to each display case [mostly modified crates] is a typewritten carddescribing the contentstherein. The display labeled “Satanism” succeeded in provoking all of us, as itproclaimed Satanism to be “aperverted religion whose members are devoted to the worship of the devil”, so“witchcraft is in no wayconnected with it”. While the Church of Satan was not mentioned by name, Dr.LaVey’s photograph was inthe center of the display, along with a membership card from the Church. Thename and membershipnumber on the card were covered by a small wooden cloven hoof. One has only tolook to realize theinference intended.Buckland himself is a nondescript, unimpressive little man. When one encountershim, the reasonsbehind his slurs and statements regarding Dr. LaVey become immediately apparent:sour grapes andjealousy. I had expected a haughty reception. Instead we were greeted cautiouslyand a bit uneasily. I dobelieve Mr. Buckland was frightened of us, as he kept eyeing us nervously andwas most polite when223 King, Francis, The Rites of Modern Occult Magic. New York: Macmillan,V/1970, page #180.224 WCBS-TV interview, op. cit.- 135 -speaking to us. What a phony, hypocritical coward! This so-called museum is ajoke, and Mr. Bucklandhimself is the biggest joke in the place. 225In Louisville I read Lilith’s report with iamusement, and on January 3, 1972 Iwrote to her:Never having met Raymond Buckland, I am not in a position to judge either hisintegrity or hisintelligence. There was some question over the validity of his doctorate inanthropology, but I understandthat it is verified by King’s College in London. On the other hand, why would aPh.D. be working forB.O.A.C. instead of the anthropological department of some American campus? He’sobviously moreinterested in superstitions than he is in Boeing 747s! All very curious. I amrelatively certain that there are afew things about Buckland’s history that he would rather not advertise.There is another reason besides the “sour grapes and jealousy” you mentioned whyBuckland hasslandered the High Priest. While Dr. LaVey is acknowledged to be the authorityon Satanism, there is noone person who can claim that distinction (?) for the Whites. Saunders,Buckland, Leek, and the rest eachclaim to be the supreme expert - if not king or queen - while denouncing theothers as frauds, charlatans,and outright traitors.We, of course, view the whole thing as rather infantile. But it would be quitevaluable to Buckland wereDr. LaVey to publicly recognize him as the Church of Satan’s principal occultadversary, as this wouldcertainly confirm Buckland’s claim to White preeminence. It would also implythat the Gardnerian Wiccapossesses enough substance to merit concern by the Church of Satan. 226I drafted a letter to Buckland, asking that he correct the misleading exhibitsin his museum and theerroneous statements concerning Anton LaVey in his Ancient and ModernWitchcraft. I sent the draft tothe LaVeys for their review, and a short time later Diane’s reply arrived in themail:Raymond Buckland’s “discourtesy to Dr. LaVey” would be better described as apersonal crusade toslander his reputation - past and present - using the most hateful, deceitfultactics we’ve yet encountered.We’ve had enough experience with the news media to have learned to roll with thepunches, so we hardlybat an eye when we encounter snide comments.But Buckland has not implied erroneous things by way of caustic or sarcastic“attacks” - he has statedthem as absolute fact! Such “inside dope” as Anton LaVey started the Church,grew a beard, and changedthe spelling of his name227 (oh, yes, and the one-time actor bit) are hardly tobe regarded as gentlemanlysparring!He’s damn lucky he’s not financially well-fixed; if he were, we would have wipedhim out with alawsuit. The only reason we didn’t file suit against him is that the attorney’sfees alone would have costmore than he’s worth in actual dollars and cents, so we could hardly expect toobtain a sufficiently sizablesettlement to make it worth our while, considering that he would ultimatelybenefit from the publicity.We’re sick of these two-bit leeches riding our coattails, and we refuse to pumpup their ailing egos byrecognizing them as worthy opponents in a “magical war” (or debate, if youprefer).Were your letter to Buckland written instead to a member of the press, or even areligionist of thetraditional variety, we wouldn’t have the slightest qualms about your sendingit, but offering him a “deal” -“you be nice to us and we’ll be nice to you” - is too much like expecting astarving animal to politely eat hishalf of the game killed by his stronger and craftier host, after having stolenhis host’s rabbit the day before.All Buckland needs is to be treated as a peer! You can bet he’d get plenty ofmileage out of such aninference. About the only thing to do with someone like him, who obviouslybelieves his own spook-storiesabout Satanists, is to scare the Hell out of him. What he needs is a renewedvision of the Satanist asportrayed by Dennis Wheatley!225 Sinclair, Lilith, Lilith Grotto Report, December 29, VI/1971.226 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lilith Sinclair, January 3, VII/1972.227 As it turned out, Buckland was correct about this, but the original spellingwas “Levey”.- 136 -Understand, this is not a critique of your letter per se, but just an attempt toenlighten you to certainfacts about “Dr.” Buckland and his ilk of which you may have no knowledge.(Incidentally his doctorate isfrom the Life Science Church, whose ordinations are sold for $25. Is it anywonder our members think theycan be Priests overnight?)We do appreciate your taking action on this matter and are grateful for yourdefense of the Master’sintegrity. I’m afraid, though, that the Gardnerian Poohbah will not be swayed byit … I would be moreinclined to think that the letter you wrote to Lilith Sinclair would serve ourpurpose in Buckland’s case. 228The WCBS-TV interview opened the door to many more, and in the next few monthsLilith and herfellow members were kept busy taping interviews for such media as Canada’s CTVand the PhiladelphiaInquirer. 229 In January of VII Lilith decided to break another kind of ice:As I’ve mentioned in earlier reports, there has been quite a bit of discussionregarding the living altar.The ladies of the Grotto are willing, but each feels that she does not want tobe the first … stalemate! Idecided to settle it and requested William Van Ness to celebrate the ritualwhile I served as the Altar. Itmade a decided difference in the ritual; the whole atmosphere was heightened,and there was, for want of abetter word, a feeling of “completeness”. The women responded as I expected andare now eager to be theAltar. Amazing what a little properly-applied lesser magic can do, especially ifapplied to the ego and vanityof the recipients …230But on the whole Lilith was very proud of the Grotto:It is most gratifying to see what a poised, polished group has evolved from theself-conscious fledglingsof last year. There is also good rapport between members, with the pettynonsense kept to a minimum bysome occasional foot-stomping and table-pounding on my part. 231By mid-VII Lilith had been ordained to the Priesthood of Mendes III° by AntonLaVey, and the LilithGrotto grew in membership to about 35 individuals. The heavy schedule ofinterviews continued to grow -from the Staten Island Register to Time magazine - and on July 15, VII asaturnine and introspective mannamed Ronald K. Barrett attended his first meeting. He had joined the Church asa member-at-large inAlexandria, Virginia in November V and, upon moving to New York, had beenreferred to the LilithGrotto as a local point of contact. To the Central Grotto Lilith commented:The highlight of July 29 meeting was a striking ceremonial costume made byRonald Barrett, who ismost dæmonic in appearance anyway! It was done in red and black, with silverstuds and snakeskinornamentation. Barrett has made quite an impression on us, and I find himextremely capable to work within our power-building rituals … He purchased one of the magnificent swords madeby Jay Solomon andthen most generously donated it to the Lilith Grotto for ceremonial use. WilliamVan Ness and Jay Solomonhave engraved the hilt with various symbols and the Sigil of Baphomet, and I amnow in the process ofworking on it. Moreover Mr. Barrett has turned his living room into a superbritual chamber and has invitedthe Grotto to meet there as a New York City location - to be known as DæmonicusTemple. 232The future looked bright for the new Lilith Grotto. Elsewhere, however, troublewas a-brewing ...228 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 6, VII/1972.229 Sinclair, Lilith, Lilith Grotto Reports, January 12 & February 8, VII/1972.230 Ibid., February 8, VII/1972.231 Ibid., April 13, VII/1972.232 Ibid., August 15 & September 20, VII/1972.[index-137_1.jpg]- 137 -On June 5, VI/1971 - the date of the Lilith Grotto’s first meeting - LarryGreen, subdeacon at myCentral Grotto Black Mass and now a Priest of Mendes III°, sent me a letterannouncing the formation ofSan Francisco’s second Grotto - the Typhon Grotto. Now that the Church of Satanwas definitelyrestructuring itself into a nationwide entity, Typhon would handle the local SanFrancisco membership,freeing 6114 California Street to serve as a true “Central Grotto”.I congratulated Larry on his undertaking, sent him copies of Nineveh’s Blacklistnewsletter, andencouraged him to begin his own publication. In January of 1972 there appearedthe first - and, as it turnedout, the only - issue of the Typhon Tusk, containing a fervent “New Year’sResolution” by Larry:Unfortunately there are those among us who call themselves Satanists - who, farfrom being self-reliant,wear our name without shouldering the responsibility that is the mark of truestrength. Satanists are thestrong! By their own brains and abilities they create success. If we areunsuccessful, it is only reasonable toassume that we are not worthy of our title.It takes guts to accept the role of Satanist. If you would enjoy the spoils ofunique existence, then youmust project the godhead within you and accept all the responsibility that itentails. There is little place forthe faint of heart or the psychic vampire within the Grotto organization.Those with too little self-esteem can only subtract from the whole, and thiscannot be tolerated. A manwho would murder his ego would do more for the Infernal Empire were he to tosshis miserable carcass offa high bridge and thus become a human sacrifice and source of energy for therest, rather than a liability tohis fellows.We enter the year VII Anno Satani. If you would make a resolution, then let itbe to accept life as a ballof clay and mold it with the dexterity of a creator into a positive and magicalritual for success throughstrength. This is only achieved through the Satanic approach of ego-build. It isnot only the early bird whocatches the worm, but the hawk, who has the intestinal fortitude to fight offthe others that would have hisprize were he too weak and unprepared to hold what he had produced forhimself.233To Larry I responded:We have just received the first issue of the Typhon Tusk, and I would like tosend my immediatecongratulations on a most professional publication. I am certain that you havealready found the paper to bequite valuable as a reference and communication device within the Grotto, and Iexpect that it won’t be longbefore the members are asking you to increase the size and frequency of theissues!234233 Green, Lawrence in Typhon Tusk #I-1, January VII/1972.234 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lawrence Green, January 3, VII/1972.- 138 -It seemed, however, that beneath the surface things were not quite so tranquilin San Francisco. A fewdays later I received a letter from Diane LaVey:I believe Anton gave you some idea of his feelings concerning Larry Green whenhe visited with youand Jan last year in Louisville; and when we spoke with you on the phone a fewweeks ago, we mentionedsomething in passing. At any rate we ask your cooperation in our attempt to coolhim down and phase himout. This is due to increasingly guileful - actually guileless! - andinsubordinate behavior.We have had countless administrative problems with him, but due to hiscalculating manner, no singleinfraction has been grave enough to warrant (at least in his mind) hisdismissal. He simply goes alongquietly creating chaos by way of keeping just short of the line; in other words,he’s constantly looking forloopholes. When he’s called on the carpet for something, he goes into his“I-only-want-to-do-the-right-thing… Ex-sul-an-see” routine.If I were to try to give examples of in what ways he’s been remiss, it wouldprobably sound as thoughwe are nit-picking; but the only way I can describe his attitude and behavior isto say we feel as though he’sconstantly straining at the bit, just waiting for a slack in the reins so he canrun amuck. He wants to “playChurch” and doesn’t miss a single chance to compare his five-member Grotto withCG when it comes tovarious duties.As I said on the phone, the only reason he wrote that to you about being glad tosee the Hoof back to itsfull size [after I assumed the Editorship - M.A.] was to get in a dig at the CGstaff - Lana Green inparticular. Of course he wouldn’t mention that it was his responsibility toprint the larger editions, and thathe then thought “quality was more important than quantity”.I have never encountered such a monkey-see, monkey-do type. The Typhon Tusk wasso named becauseit was the only thing he could think of that would be at all similar to theCloven Hoof while still maintainingthe theme of the Grotto. He assumes such an attitude of sovereignty that he isinsufferable; even the HighPriest, it would seem, is in need of his “blessings”.I’ll never forget the time he came in and saw the Look issue with Anton’s covershot. At first hepretended not to notice it. Then when it was obvious he had to acknowledge itspresence, he picked it up,thumbed to the inside (no mention of the cover), frantically searching for aline or two he could criticize (noreaction to the inside two-page photo either), and launched into a tirade aboutwhat bad press the Church ofSatan always gets, with subtle implications that, were the High Priest moreproficient in dealing with themedia, perhaps it might be otherwise.Again, though, what do you say: “Aren’t you proud to see ‘His Ex-sul-an-see’ onthe cover?” or “Wouldyou like to congratulate us now, or would it be more to your liking to do soduring a special ritual arrangedin your honor?” I hate to say it, but he could be another Wayne West if givenhalf a chance; he’s anothervocal faggot, alas. [By this time West had left the Church in disgrace - M.A.]Back to the Typhon Tusk: We realize you are trying to encourage the publicationof local bulletins andnewsletters, and certainly agree that it is a good idea. But we will more thanlikely receive copies of yourletter to him, complete with gold frame and wall mountings so they can bedisplayed throughout 6114. Ofcourse I’m exaggerating … but not very much!The fact of the matter is that he had no part in the layout, typing, printing,or mailing of his Grottonewsletter, and only those portions that either gave him a chance to toot hisown horn, talk about donations,or announce his birthday were actually written by him (and proofread andcorrected by Anton and myself!).I don’t know how you can get around it, but we would prefer that he not bepermitted to reprint fromthe Blacklist - he’ll find a way to take credit, even if he gives you a creditline. Maybe you can say you’vedecided to incorporate parts of it in a book you’re doing, or some such thing. Ishudder to think what thatmight encourage him to do, though; maybe we’d best think of some other reason.If we don’t, you mayanticipate a letter from him announcing his new project: a book on Satanism!To sum up our feelings on this matter: Larry is sucking as much as he can fromthe C/S and givingalmost nothing in return. He has approximately sixty members assigned to hisGrotto, and an averageattendance of three to seven. Something’s wrong somewhere. We have sent many newmembers to him onlyto have them fall by the wayside after one attendance.- 139 -We’re working on a new Grotto for S.F., and for the time being we will besending any new members tothe Karnak Grotto in Santa Cruz. If Larry Green had the position outside theChurch, he could be anotherYussupov, in that he harbors the same personality traits!We are going to try to let him down gradually, thereby avoiding another WayneWest fiasco and perhapsretaining the few good members who have stuck with Typhon because there’snowhere else. We wouldappreciate it, therefore, if you would refrain from all but the most perfunctorycorrespondence with him. 235I so refrained, and nothing more was heard of the Typhon Grotto - except that,when Rev. L. DaleSeago formed his Yuggoth Grotto in Los Angeles in IX/1974, Typhon alumnus andWarlock II° RogerSinclair surfaced in Hollywood and joined the Grotto. He had been Typhon’sCeremonial Director and hadcontributed scholarly articles on Thoth and Kali Ma to the Tusk. 236The “Wayne West fiasco” began, innocuously enough, in June of VI/1971 when Antonand DianeLaVey announced a sudden change in the Cloven Hoof:Commencing with this issue there will be no further listing of our familiarcommunication roster. Thebasic intent of this roster was, of course, to provide a means whereby Satanistscould establish contact withothers of similar interests appearing on the list. The Cloven Hoof initiated arecent attempt to simplify andthereby improve this system by offering to include names and addresses inaddition to membership numbersof each individual wishing to participate. The response was apathetic, theattempt abortive.“John M. Kincaid” went on to say that members would now be expected to use theRegional Agentsystem for interpersonal contact. Personal “letters to the Editor” and extendedessays on magicalphilosophy would also be cut from the Hoof, again with the expectation that theAgent system and thelocal Grottos would compensate. “Kincaid” stressed the positive role of theseinstitutions:Deserving of considerable approbation are the burgeoning, expertly conceived andpresented regionalnewsletters. This type of individual effort by these skilled, sincere, andpowerfully motivated Satanists isprecisely the kind of activity which will aid in clearing the paths forintra-regional communication ofmembers. These publications afford the latest regional information of interest,as well as contain all relevantdirectives from the Central Grotto. The effect engendered is one of unity, justas the small-town newspaperis indispensable as an organ of intelligence and thus unity. 237The Cloven Hoof thus went from 15-20 pages per month to 4-8, and issues nowconsisted principallyof single essays, presumably by Anton LaVey. In July he exhorted the membershipto concentrate on thesubstance, not the mere imagery of true Satanism:What, therefore, does one prudently expect to receive from one’s religion if notthose deserts achievedby implementation of sustained loyalty and intrepidity as manifested by one’sdaily activities relevant to hisreligion? After all, Golden Opportunity, when disrobed before us, often appearswith quite another identity:Hard Work! Hence she frequently passes unrecognized by many who are obviouslyfar the worse for it.Although we may choose to avoid and ignore mundane maxims describing the fruitsof honest labor, it ill-behooves us to adjourn the workbench on any day without a definitive applicationof our best talents towardconstruction of a superior Satanic mousetrap for all the remaining sightless.Surely, then, the Earth with all its promise is much too magnificent a gift tofall prey to those ofboundless, unfettered hypocrisy. Let us summon the great powers of Thoth andSekhmet to marshal ourenergies into a seething tempest! We must strive for control of our environment;we must usurp the fatted235 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 6, VII/1972.236 Letter, L. Dale Seago to Executive Secretary, Central Grotto, November 25,IX/1974.237 LaVey, Anton “John M. Kincaid” in Cloven Hoof, June VI/1971, pages #1-2.- 140 -hams who sit in judgment of us. We must supplant “pious” pomposity with incisiveintelligence. If we areto be heard through the din of the wailing, lost sheep, we must speak out!Anton concluded his appeal with a quotation from Friedrich Nietzsche:“But some day, in a stronger age than this decaying, self-doubting present, hemust yet come to us, theredeeming man of great love and contempt, the creative spirit whose compellingstrength will not let himrest in any aloofness or any beyond, whose isolation is misunderstood by thepeople as if it were flight fromreality - while it is only his absorption, immersion, penetration into reality,so that, when he one dayemerges again into the light, he may bring home the redemption of this reality:its redemption from thecurse that the hitherto reigning ideal has laid upon it.“This man of the future, who will redeem us not only from the hitherto reigningideal but also from thatwhich was bound to grow out of it, the great nausea, the will to nothingness,nihilism; this bell-stroke ofnoon and of the great decision that liberates the will again and restores itsgoal to the Earth and his hope toman; this Antichrist and antinihilist; this victor over God and nothingness - hemust come one day.” 238At this time I was still unaware that “John M. Kincaid” was merely a nom deplume for Anton andDiane LaVey, and in September I wrote to “him” rather more bluntly than I wouldhave to the LaVeyspersonally:The revision of the Hoof a few months ago has been received both pro and con.The new issues appearto be more meticulously edited, and the involved essays on various aspects ofSatanism elicit enthusiasm onthe members’ part. Articles or essays by the High Priest, predictably, generatetremendous interest. I hopethat comments by Dr. LaVey will be featured in each issue to come.On the con side, many members would prefer the Hoof to be expanded to its oldlength. The old format,while perhaps less dignified, had entertainment value as well as strictlyphilosophical discourse. And themembers’ comments - both the academic expressions and the “nut” letters - gavethe lay Satanist theimpression that his opinion was welcomed by the Central Grotto. The old Hoofappeared to be morenationally oriented than the new one, which, albeit intentionally, comes acrossas a Central Grotto bulletinalone.The Nineveh members are quite curious about developments in other local Grottos- Typhon, Pluto, andthe Babylon group. They would also like to see news about prospective Grottos -such as those in New Yorkand Washington, D.C. And, for that matter, it would be interesting to know whatsort of “unclassified”projects the Central Grotto is pursuing.One thing you should know is that members view the Hoof as their basic“material” return for the $15annual fee. The amount of the fee is not a source of discontent as long as thesize and content of the Hoofmake the individual feel that his funds are well-invested.You and I both know that the annual fees are used for a number of things inaddition to the Hoof. Butremember that special publications (such as the Agents’ Newsletter) and otheradministrative operations areoften unknown to the lay member. Since his renewal is contingent upon hissatisfaction with the results ofhis moral and financial investment, it is important that he be given either (a)a self-evident return in theform of an expanded and forceful Hoof or (b) some idea about thefinancially-based projects of the Churchof Satan.Remember that I am not talking about the stability of the clergy, but about thefeelings of I° Satanist JoeSchmuck. He is aware that the services of his local Grotto are not derived orfunded from the $15 fee, andhe is the one to whom the Hoof is of greatest importance. I cannot overemphasizethis.In a recent conversation with Reverend West, I asked how the Hoof was beingreceived by themembership in his vicinity. He replied that Babylon’s situation was much thesame as Nineveh’s - that the238 LaVey, Anton, “Toward the Compleat Satanist” in Cloven Hoof, July VI/1971.- 141 -lay members would greatly appreciate an expanded national newsletter. Enoughcopies of the old Hoof arecirculating so that individuals are aware of the difference. 239In her response Diane stressed that the $15 annual renewal fee should beconsidered as anorganizational membership fee, not a publication subscription fee:Members must realize that they are not simply supporting a monthly publication,but that they arehelping to support the Church of Satan as a whole - something they claim tobelieve in and wish to seegrow and achieve certain goals it has set for itself.Much as the old format might have been “fun” and encouraging to the lay Satanistwho wished tocontribute his comments to it, it is (a) simply not feasible to put out apublication of that size monthly -perhaps if it were to be bimonthly we could, but the members seem to need themore frequent contact withC.G. that the monthly newsletter provides; and (b) at this point it isimperative that the more dignifiedimage be maintained, lest we backslide from the stature we are just nowbeginning to attain.We still have a long ways to go to bring the C of S up to the level of publicacceptance - a major goal ofthe Church, for it will benefit all members - and just one misplaced copy of anofficial publicationconveying an image contrary to what we are striving to attain (or maintain)could undo much.Insofar as the C.H. being nationally oriented, we intend for it to appear as theone “official bulletin”from “headquarters”. This is precisely why we are encouraging other groups tobegin their own regionalnewsletters, which would contain items of interest to each one’s particulararea.For the first time the Master feels comfortable including something of his owncreation in thenewsletter. Before, with the rushed job that had to be done on it and the timeand expense that went into it,he really didn’t feel justified in spending the time composing articles thatwould wind up sandwiched inbetween a goodly amount of filler and presented in such poorly edited issuesthat his contributions weremore expected than appreciated.Perhaps it will sound egotistical, but we frankly felt it was quite a lot toexpect, when the greater part ofthe membership couldn’t be bothered to compose and submit something for the C.H.so we wouldn’t haveto lose sleep wondering what, besides Rev. Aquino’s and Rev. West’s articles, wewould fill ten to twentypages with. His time would have been better spent writing articles and bookswhose monetary rewardscould be put towards the Church’s progress.Rev. West’s comments on his members’ opinion of the C.H. does not surprise us. Iwould imagine theyare especially aware of the shrinkage in the size of the C.H. since they nolonger have the Babylonian as anadditional source of information and guidance. We trust Rev. West will resumepublication of his bulletinsas soon as his health permits. We suggested that he might give a few of his morecapable members a crackat it, if only for the fun of working together on a joint venture connected withthe Church. This didn’tappeal to him, for he expressed much doubt as to his members’ ability to producea publication worthy ofthe name The Babylonian.Diane also took the opportunity to clear up two other matters: her references toAnton as “the Master”and the real identity of “JMK”:Lest you think that the High Priest has taken to whipping his disciples andterrorizing them intoacknowledging him as their Lord and Master, because of my referrals to him asthe latter, I assure you hehasn’t. I began calling him “Master” or referring to him as “the Master” a fewmonths ago, because I wasnever really comfortable using “Doctor”, inasmuch as I am not overly impressedwith most academiciansand that term evoked a rather alien sensation in me whenever I would use it.So since I had been calling him “Master” occasionally in much the same way awife might say “you’rethe boss”, “yes, boss”, or “ask the boss about it”, I decided that would be mypet name for him. It’s assimple as that. Understand, I’m not saying he isn’t a tyrant - he’s a terribleogre! He even kicks smallchildren, dogs, and old people.239 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John M. Kincaid, September 20, VI/1971.- 142 -The other matter concerns our Minister of Information, John M. Kincaid … In theearly days, shortlyafter the Church was formed, a fellow who was one of the first members (andstill is one, albeit anunderground member, due to his profession) went by the name John M. Kincaid andused the title given himby the Master on any tracts or correspondence he composed. When he could nolonger spare the time forthis and felt he had to devote more time to his own professional pursuits(besides feeling that his anonymitywould be jeopardized eventually by the growing number of members with whom hisattendancenecessitated his association), someone had to fill the gap. So Miss Greenlearned to reproduce his signatureand began answering his mail. Eventually, as the correspondence grew, John M.Kincaid became apermanent fixture with the C of S. In about the past year, Rev. Kincaid hasundergone another personality(and sex) change; he is now a sort of composite of Lana Green and three or fourassistants (both men - oneof whom is Rex - and women) at C.G. Even though you are probably thoroughlyconfused at this point, Imust conclude this “explanation” here. One more thing, though: There are onlytwo other persons who areprivy to this information, and for the time being we like it that way. 240In August of 1971 Wayne West visited San Francisco. “I think the visit Waynepaid C.G. stoked thefires under him,” wrote Anton to me. “It was almost imperative that he make thetrip.” 241 A short timelater, however, Diane expressed guarded misgivings to me:We have been meaning to mention something to you concerning your practice ofsending carbon copiesof much of your correspondence to Rev. West. Ordinarily we would have noobjection to this, for wecertainly encourage brainstorming between members - especially amongst theofficials of the Church.But we are honestly concerned that Rev. West seems so insistent that all mattersconcerning theactivities of a Grotto other than his own be brought to his attention. Were thisto appear as genuine interestin exchanging ideas and information on Grotto proceedings in hopes of betteringeach, we would bedelighted.I’m afraid, however, that this is not necessarily so in the Nineveh/Babylonsituation. And it is more thana little disappointing to us.As you know, from the beginning the Master has placed a great deal of faith inyou, and others whosense this resent you for your past achievements and what your future in the Cof S appears to hold. As I’msure you can understand, it is extremely difficult to put in a letter what needsto be said in this regard. Ifonly the Master could sit down and talk with you for an hour, so many thingscould be said and clarifiedwhich often are misconstrued in writing. 242The September Hoof commenced with an article describing the characteristics of aSatanic Master -the Church of Satan’s original formal title for the degree of Magus (V°).“Briefly stated,” said Anton, “aSatanic Master is one who, by the conscious application of certain principles,has created a thing, idea, orsituation which, because of its creation, has severely influenced or modifiedthe lives and motivations ofgreat numbers of the world’s people.”He went on to stress the deliberation of such an act; merely being in the rightplace at the right time tobe an unconscious catalyst is not sufficient. Nor, he continued, is theorysufficient; the idea must be putinto meaningful practice. The Wright Brothers and David Sarnoff, he suggested,are more deserving of thetitle of Satanic Master than are Aleister Crowley and MacGregor Mathers:It is bad enough to hear of the “great teachings” of Aleister Crowley - whohypocritically called himselfby the Christian Devil’s number, yet steadfastly denied any Satanic connections,who wrote and hadpublished millions of words of Cabalistic mulligatawny, the distilled wisdom ofwhich could have beencontained in a single volume of once-popular E. Haldeman Julius’ Little BlueBooks (which sold for a240 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 24, VI/1971.241 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, August 19, VI/1971.242 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 24, VI/1971.- 143 -nickel) … If Crowley were a magician, it was the beauty of his creative artwhich made him so, not hisdrug-befuddled callings-up of Choronzon et al.I get fed up to the stomach-turning point listening to would-be students waxingeloquent over IsraelRegardie’s Golden Dawn, with its ponderous bulk blotched by sigil after sigil ofholy esoterica. The veryjacket design fairly screams out “Oh, God, how good and light and righteous weare!” with a rayed cross ofa magnitude that should have awakened Bela Lugosi back to life out of sheershock. Mr. Regardie, like hiswhite-light predecessors, rambles through five pounds of accumulated Cabalistictoxemia and burned-outRosicrucianism before his literary enema yields a scant few pages of today’sdinner, namely a watered-down version of the Enochian Keys.No, I cannot accept the worth of these “masters”, who couldn’t get off asemi-logical thought withoutfalling victim to what H.G. Wells superbly defines as “big thinks”. These workswere around when I wrotethe Satanic Bible. I had even read them, as well as Montague Summers, RolloAhmed, Ophiel, Bardo,Butler, Hall, etc., who wrote reams of arcane rhetoric and produced plates ofpretty symbols, yet couldn’tseem to say what they meant nor mean what they said. Somehow an occasionalmember who has“discovered” an occult “master’s” writings of the past forgets all about thoseopening lines in the preface tothe Satanic Bible, assuming, I guess, that I didn’t know about his newfound bitof esoterica when I took penin hand.At the tender age of twelve, when I grew disenchanted halfway through theAlbertus Magnus and athird of the way through the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, it occurred to methat there must be “deeperstuff”, so I delved. Alas, I found the deeper stuff was deeper, all right - andpiled higher as well. For everypage of meat it seemed there were a hundred pages of filler, adding up to apretty, plump, but decidedlyersatz hunk of baloney.I wrote the Satanic Bible because I looked for such a book all my life and,unable to find it, concludedthat if I ever expected to read what I was seeking, would have to write itmyself. The same principle appliedto the Compleat Witch.Summing up, if you need to steep yourselves in occult lore, despite thisdiatribe, by all means do so.But do it as a ritual in itself, i.e. objectively towards subjective ends! Readon, knowing that you won’tlearn a damn thing in principle from Levi, Crowley, Regardie (or Sybil Leekeither!) that isn’t extendedone-hundredfold in the Satanic Bible or Compleat Witch, but that you’ll have thespooky fun, ego food, andinvolvement which invariably accompany a curriculum concerned more with thegathering of ingredientsthan with the application of principles. 243I thought Anton’s basic point well-taken but a bit overstated. There is much inthe literature oftraditional occultism that is not only sophisticated and profound in principlebut suitable for practicalapplication as well. Granted such material must often be distilled frominaccurate or obsolete data, but thesame is true for virtually all fields of philosophy and science. [I don’t careto speak on behalf of SybilLeek, however.] Moreover I knew that Anton was sufficient of a scholar torecognize the legitimate worthof various occult classics; something else must be behind this suddentongue-lashing. A clue as to what itwas came shortly thereafter - in a copy of a letter from Wayne West to Anton:It is with the most profound regret that I advise you of the dissolution of theBabylon Grotto, witheffective date of 25 September VI. I am of course deeply grieved by such action,since I have always heldand shall continue to hold both yourself and the Lady Diane in the highestesteem. Your personal friendshipis much valued, and while I realize that I shall be deprived of such friendship,my decision to dissolve theBabylon Grotto has been brought about by several important factors.The recent issue of the Cloven Hoof has elicited severe criticism from themembership for twoparticular reasons: its lack of content and the clear mandate to avoid readingsuch authors as Levi, Crowley,Ahmed, Ophiel, Bardo, Butler, Hall, etc., with the implication that one iswasting time in such pursuits. Iam personally cognizant of Your Excellency’s reasons for such a mandate. While Iconcur that these243 LaVey, Anton, “What is a Satanic Master?” and “From the High Priest” inCloven Hoof, September VI/1971.- 144 -gentlemen leave much to be desired, it is my personal contention that such worksare worthy of perusal iffor no other reason than to familiarize oneself with the obvious inadequaciescontained therein.The membership has also been disillusioned with the Cloven Hoof due to the factthat many of theissues promised some “magical” teaching or other in the ensuing issue whichnever appeared, with theresultant effect that continuity of aim and purpose was seriously impeded.Additionally the operational costs of maintaining a Grotto have also played animportant role in mythinking. While the individual Grotto does have access to certain revenues, theydo not cover the totalexpense involved and quite frequently impose unnecessary hardship on the GrottoLeader, more particularlywhen one takes into consideration the time and expense involved in maintainingcontact with the variousnews and exposure media for the purpose of enhancing and promoting the Church ofSatan. As YourExcellency is fully aware, I have always made it emphatically clear that it wasnever my intent to “make”money in the service of the Church, but the limited monies derived from Grottoattendance do not coversuch obvious expenses as telephone bills, stationery, ritual chamber facilitiesand equipment, etc.My personal attitudes and opinions concerning the teachings of the Satanic Bibleremain as firm as theywere in the beginning, and I shall continue to defend them to the utmost of myability. I would not wish tobe accused of abandoning the doctrines which have become my very life force, andthe tenets andphilosophies expounded in the Satanic Bible are my own particular beliefs. Theyare based on the mostprofound logic and reason and are a true source of inspiration.Nor would I presume to judge Your Excellency’s policies for the successfuloperation of theorganization as a whole. I have made these points emphatically clear to themembership of the BabylonGrotto and have given them no reason whatsoever to doubt your judgments in thisregard. I have alwaysdone my utmost to maintain the image of the Church of Satan in this area of theUnited States and shallcontinue to do so on your behalf on those occasions when it becomes necessary.The other, lesser aspects which prompted my decision have already been discussedwith the LadyDiane, and I feel confident that she will already have appraised you of them.While some of them may seemof little consequence, they are of vital importance to me and were, therefore,required to be made known.I am deeply appreciative of Your Excellencies’ kind attentions to me and shallcontinue to regard youboth with the deepest affection.244As surprising as this letter was, it paled beside the proclamation (Appendix#29) issued by the LaVeysa few days later. My copy arrived together with a note from Diane:While we dislike the time-consuming task of dignifying Mr. West by such alengthy and detailed report,we find it necessary because of intense concern on the part of those membersformerly under his authority.Each point taken was raised by members who requested elucidation. 245To say that Nineveh was nonplussed is an understatement. Despite hisofficiousness, fierce anti-Catholicism, and “British” pomposity, Wayne West had always been respected asone of the Church’smost dynamic leaders and organizers - comparable, perhaps, to John Ferro.Although West and I had little in common in terms of personality, I had foundhim likable almost inspite of himself for his enthusiasm, commitment, and unashamed Satanic arrogance[as ought to be clearfrom Appendix #7!]. And he and I had shared one conviction brought out by theNorthglenn Incident - thatSatanists in general and the Satanic Priesthood in particular should take astand - proudly and publicly - onbehalf of the Prince of Darkness whose name they had taken “as a part ofthemselves”.Wayne West made no response to the Central Grotto proclamation, and, for thatmatter, I saw noreason to doubt Anton’s or Diane’s truthfulness. I was appalled, sad, andfurious all at once; to the LaVeysI wrote:244 Letter, Wayne West to Anton LaVey, September 27, VI/1971.245 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 1, VI/1971.- 145 -The discussion of Wayne West’s exploits was most interesting. I had no idea thatthe corruption was soextensive. It’s intriguing to compare the facts of the matter to thatSocrates-drinking-the-hemlock letter hewrote you! I wonder if he will continue to pose so nobly once he has seenhimself vivisected in print. Inspite of the fact that we bore no great love towards Wayne West, we are verysorry that this distastefulbusiness had to happen at all. I suppose that the worst possible frustration isto spend a good deal of timeteaching an individual who then uses his newfound knowledge to turn around andkick you in the teeth. 246As it turned out, West’s letter was a rather inaccurate prediction of hissubsequent attitude towardsboth the Church of Satan and its High Priest. In March of 1972 the Detroit FreePress printed an article(Appendix #30) on West and his current venture, a “First Occultic Church ofMan”. It drew immediate firefrom Warlock Michael A. Grumboski, Regional Agent in Detroit and past AssistantGrotto Leader ofBabylon. To the Free Press Grumboski wrote:In your article you mention, and I quote: “Division and strife marked withname-calling have erupted inthe Church of Satan.” I beg to differ. The matter of Mr. West’s departure fromour ranks was marked withsome ill feelings, but certainly not to the extent you portray in your article.I did not agree with Mr. West’snew organization, but in many ways I do miss his warm and cordial manner. He wasa superb host as wellas a very eloquent orator. But even these fine qualities do not make a SatanicPriest.Mr. West seems to be overtly concerned with trying to insult Dr. LaVey. It is mybelief that he (West) istaking this action because Dr. LaVey clearly saw that West only wanted powerthrough his role as Priest. Asin any churchly group, our leaders wish only the best for their membership. Whenthe ego of one man startsto stifle his membership’s thinking (as in the case of Mr. West), then it ishigh time for new leadership. Tofurther clarify, I do not condemn Mr. West for his new “occult” group. Nay, as aSatanist I believe he did thebest thing for himself, which is very Satanic!Mr. West alleged that Dr. LaVey forbade the reading of certain books. Thearticle, which Mr. Westfalsely interpreted, stated that since the recent splash of occult paperbackshas hit the market, one must becareful not to buy, as the High Priest calls it, “occult pornography”. Oneshould take a careful look at whathe is purchasing. No ban was ever placed on reading material or anything else.The laws of Satanism arevery simple: One need only obey the laws of the land he resides in and his ownpersonal set of ethics -which can be more difficult to follow than the Ten Commandments of our Christianbrothers. We wish tobother no one. Let them believe as they desire; in return let us practice asfree men also.I hope in later articles you find it appropriate to notify your readership thatthe Church of Satan isdefinitely functioning at full force under the capable leadership of Mr. DouglasRobbins [Belphegor GrottoLeader]. 247I recall that, as I read my copy of the Wayne West Excommunication Proclamationin October of 1971,I naïvely supposed the cancer to have been cut out - that there might be alittle cleaning up to do, but thatthe essential problem had been dealt with conclusively. Now, with the advantageof hindsight, I am of theopinion that the West episode was the beginning of a series of shocks thatultimately led to the final crisisof the Church in 1975.The Northglenn Incident had spotlighted the impotence of Satanists who, when thechips were down,placed their social acceptance before even the most diplomatic affirmation oftheir religious affiliation.Wayne West represented perhaps the opposite extreme - the Satanist whoproclaimed his beliefsopenly and proudly, and social ostracism be damned! The fatal weakness of West’sposition, of course,was that he was predictably shunned by secular society. Presumably his personalfinancial positionbecame so desperate that he tried to make ends meet by using Church of Satanmembership and insigniafunds - perhaps a hundred or so dollars in all, which even in 1971 could nothave helped him very much.246 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton & Diane LaVey, October 5, VI/1971.247 Letter, Michael Grumboski to the Detroit Free Press, March 27, VII/1972.- 146 -As the LaVeys watched the West disaster from San Francisco, they must haveconcluded that aprogram for the Church based upon “open Satanism” was precarious at best andquite possibly fatal atworst. They themselves had been able to be “open Satanists” and even to make aliving from it - throughmeetings, lectures, and Anton’s literary ventures. Wayne West was the first totry to emulate AntonLaVey’s public posture as a subordinate official, and he had failed - sooverwhelmingly that he had to becast from the Priesthood and from membership altogether.The disgrace and expulsion of a Satanic Priest, moreover, was not the sort ofthing one could pass offas a mere administrative action. A Priest of Mendes was held to be a beingordained and sanctified in thename of the Prince of Darkness. His strength, integrity, and nobility of purposeshould be those of theDevil himself. How, then, could he fail and fall - not in a gallant quest, ashad Satan himself, but throughmiserable, dishonorable motives?The West expulsion thus demonstrated, for the first time since 1966, that theChurch of Satan - and thePriesthood - was fallible and vulnerable. It could make mistakes; it could beblooded; it could even perish.It might be inspired by and consecrated to the Powers of Darkness, butultimately it would stand or fall onthe qualities of the individuals who comprised its membership amidst humanity.As is evident from the Excommunication Proclamation, Anton and Diane made everyeffort to restoremembers’ belief and confidence in the “infallible, invincible monolith”, and atthe time they appeared tosucceed. But - with the sole exception of myself - no other individual in theChurch would ever again beentrusted with the knowledge, prerogatives, and power which Wayne West hadenjoyed. Whateversuccesses Priests and Priestesses achieved henceforth would be almost entirelythe fruits of their ownefforts in their own spheres of influence; they would be kept at arm’s lengthfrom the “Central Brain” sothat, if a West-type situation ever developed again, they could be efficientlyand plausibly amputated.This should not be taken to mean that Anton and Diane LaVey were eitherunappreciative ofsubsequent membership effort or disdainful of individual officials and members.Quite the contrary, theyboth worked hard to encourage and assist members. And members of all degrees whomet the High Priestand High Priestess, either in San Francisco or elsewhere, were invariablyreceived with warmth andcourtesy. But the LaVeys were both energized by the ideal of the Church ofSatan, and to the extent thatthe reality of the Church could not measure up to that ideal, it would beexpendable.Satanists thus began to live in a curious sort of Twilight Zone in which theywere either “tuned in” or“tuned out” of the “ideal Church of Satan” regardless of their standing - andeven Priesthood - in the realone. It took three and a half years after the Babylon disaster for this trend tocompletely supplant therealism of the LaVeys’ original philosophy, and it was by no means a steady andinevitable process.As will be seen, there were many times between 1971 and 1975 when Anton andDiane displayed thehope, faith, and confidence in the real Church which had enabled it to come asfar as it had for as long as ithad. There were, after all, many wonderful and inspiring successes to come, manyof which were thedirect result of efforts by Satanists across the country.Just as regularly, however, the LaVeys would be hurt, disillusioned, anddisappointed by humiliatingsetbacks, debacles, and corruption. There was no final, identifiable straw thatbroke the camel’s back in1975, but by that time the camel was staggering under the weight of a lot ofstraws.But this was October 1971, Wayne West was “a dead issue”, and we were impatientto proceed with“the great task ahead of us”.[index-147_1.jpg]- 147 -The Babylon crisis was sparked, if not truly caused by changes in the ClovenHoof newsletter, and theseriousness of the Church-wide reaction to those changes made it apparent thatsomething would have tobe done to restore the publication to its former effectiveness andattractiveness. I offered to help by editingand making generally available a literary supplement to the Hoof called TheVortex, and in September ofVI/1971 Diane LaVey’s reply arrived:We like your idea of supplementing the C.H. with a more scholarly publication,but why not make it themain publication of the C of S? Frankly it has become a bit of a pain in therump having to sweat overcomposing it [or Anton’s instructing someone else in writing it], gettingsomeone to type it, run it off andmail it every month, when his time should be devoted to writing and setting intomotion certain magicalworkings [one project in particular - “Phase 5”] which we haven’t the slightestdoubt would “blow the lidoff” for good.He has some “tricks” in his bag that could well create an entirely new industryas well as influencemankind as nothing has since the first means of long-distance, masscommunication or air travel. It’s notsome esoteric, head-in-the-clouds magical theory either, and I’m notexaggerating as to the “change inaccordance with his will” which it would accomplish.I’m no mental giant, but I do know my husband, and I have learned to recognizewhen he is truly on thethreshold of something of import (such as the precedent-breaking Church ofSatan). This time, though, itencompasses the mental, physical, spiritual, emotional - all of which aremanipulated (believe it or not -again - for the betterment of mankind) via a material object and a complexprogram which mustaccompany this device.This time, however, he’s built in a “compulsion element”; so even if theinhabitants of this spherepersist in their apathetic, epimethean approach to their future, they’ll have nochoice but to do what is bestfor themselves and others of their kind.The only problem is that it’s going to take T-I-M-E - quite a lot of timebecause, as with all successfulworkings, each step must be allowed to fully develop before going on to thenext. In the early stages theplan will not be recognized as being capable of that for which it was originallydevised [which is to ouradvantage], and the implementation of all facets of the total scheme may notcome about for many years. Inthe meantime, though, even the minor changes which will take place will be wellworth the effort.[About now, you’re surely telling Janet: “She’s really flipped; the pressuresmust have gotten to her.”] Irealize this is apt to sound to you like something out of a mad doctor story,but if I weren’t so nebulous inmy description, you really might start worrying about the Master’s sanity.248At the time I had not the slightest idea what Diane was talking about, but Iassumed the LaVeys wouldelaborate in their own good time and so did not press her for details. Over thenext few years Anton’s248 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 20, VI/1971.- 148 -project would gradually unfold. In essence it involved the creation ofhuman-featured robots or androids[a la Walt Disney’s “audio-animatronic” devices].Anton’s androids, however, would be specifically designed to respond and appealto the intellectual,emotional, and sexual fetishes of their owners. One might describe them as theultimate elaboration of the“blow-up dolls” which may be found in “marital aids”-type hard core pornographystores. But what Antonhad in mind was not just a sex toy, but an artificial, “ideal” companion foreach individual who ordered"},{"pageContent":"one.The roots of this concept may be found in many classics of “robot” literature,such as Thea vonHarbou’s Metropolis and Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot. An episode of Rod Serling’soriginal Twilight Zonetelevision series dealt with a marooned astronaut who finally came to prefer thecompany of a “female”android to that of the real humans who came to rescue him.Probably the earliest example of this theme is the Greek classical legend ofPygmalion and Galatea.Pygmalion, an ancient Cypriot, was so offended by the female debauchery he sawaround him that hecame to hate all women and resolved never to marry. He made an ivory statue of abeautiful woman,however, fell in love with it, and asked Aphrodite to give it life. His wish wasgranted, and the statuebecame the living woman Galatea. That Anton was strongly moved by this legend isevidenced by hisgiving his daughter Zeena the middle name of “Galatea”.There is also a more sinister version of the legend of Galatea, and it is to befound in the“Necronomicon” of the Church of Satan, Robert W. Chambers’ The King in Yellow -the book that AntonSzandor LaVey kept locked away among his most sacred and dangerous possessions.One of the chapters of that work is entitled “The Mask”, and its theme is theattaining of perfection inbeauty by turning it to stone. Boris, a sculptor, has discovered a chemicalsolution which turns living fleshinto almost opalescent, rose-hued marble. His beautiful wife Genevieve,delirious because of fever,confesses her true love for the narrator to him and her stunned husband:At the same instant, our three lives turned into new channels; the bond that hadheld us so long togethersnapped forever and a new bond was forged in its place, for she had spoken myname, and as the fevertortured her, her heart poured out its load of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb Ibowed my head, while myface burned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my ears, stupefying mewith its clamor. Incapable ofmovement, incapable of speech, I listened to her feverish words in an agony ofshame and sorrow. I couldnot silence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt an arm upon my shoulder,and Boris turned a bloodlessface to mine … The last thing I recollect with any distinctness was hearing Jacksay, “For Heaven’s sake,doctor, what ails him, to wear a face like that?” and I thought of The King inYellow and the Pallid Mask.In despair Genevieve casts herself into the deadly pool, and Boris, ondiscovering her, shoots himselfthrough the heart. Finally, after a terrible, lingering ordeal of madness andmortification, the narratornerves himself to enter the sealed room containing the transformed Genevieve:The heavy doors swung inward under my trembling hands. Sunlight poured throughthe window,tipping with gold the wings of Cupid, and lingered like a nimbus over the browsof the Madonna. Hertender face bent in compassion over a marble form so exquisitely pure that Iknelt and signed myself.Genevieve lay in the shadow under the Madonna, and yet, through her white arms,I saw the pale azurevein, and beneath her softly clasped hands the folds of her dress were tingedwith rose, as if from somefaint, warm light within her breast. Bending with a breaking heart I touched themarble drapery with mylips, then crept back into the silent house.“The Mask” concludes as the narrator discovers that the effect of the chemicalis temporary. He returns to themarble room to find Genevieve once more alive, but the account ends abruptly andone is left to ponder thesubsequent fate of the two lovers … as Chambers quotes from The King in Yellow,Act I, Scene 2:- 149 -Camilla:You, sir, should unmask.Stranger:Indeed?Cassilda:Indeed it’s time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.Stranger:I wear no mask.Camilla:(Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!Now in her letter Diane returned to the subject of the Cloven Hoof:Your idea for separate levels of publication for qualified members is a goodidea, but if the C.H. wereconsolidated and you were running it, it would be an excellent idea.The only thing we would have to watch is that even the lowest level editionwould not cast adisparaging light on the Church when outsiders happen to see it [which, let’sface it, they will]. We stillfavor the C.H. ’s being composed with regard to the opinions and/orcomprehension capacity of the few,who will read it, get something out of it, and perhaps contribute something toit - and to the Church ingeneral - rather than the many, who are little more than names on a mailinglist.Before we accuse you of being overly-democratic, it’s only fair to tell you wesuspect that your purposein suggesting the multilevel format (translation: a more “highbrow” format andcontent for those capable ofcomprehending same) was to criticize without having to criticize [which yourkeen sense of tact wouldprevent you from doing].As a matter of fact, without sifting through your whole file to find youroriginal prospectus on Vortex Ican’t be sure, but didn’t you originally intend for it to replace the C.H. ? Imay be wrong; but if this is thecase, you needn’t have been so foxy about it. Rest assured, we wouldn’t havetaken umbrage - we never dowhen criticism is backed by solution and assistance. We would be free of a largeburden if we had only onepublication - the Agents’ Bulletin - emanating from here.We haven’t come to dread doing the C.H. per se. We’re just fed up with having totry to fit it in witheverything else that needs to be done and then being less than elated with theresults of our earnest butfragmented efforts. We have had others writing partial issues, but as long asit’s up to us to get it outwhenever no one else happens to be available - or if they are capable of“creating” only about one or twoessays before exhausting their resources or inspiration - we might as wellcompose it all. It also saves our“psychic energy” (or whatever you’d call it) by not having to pet and cajole.The Master recently made up his personal “Think”-type sign:* * *There are many who would take my time. I shun them.There are many who would share my time. I tolerate them.There are precious few who would contribute to my time. These I appreciate.* * *If the Blacklist is any indication of what you could come up with on a granderscale, the C of S wouldhave a publication of which its founder and titular head would, at long last,truly feel proud.Before closing, Diane had a few words to say on the subject of the Church’sfinances, which had beenone of the topics discussed during the Babylon crisis:Surely we must be the most charitable organization in the world! I doubt thatmost of those who areusing the name and reputation for which we have worked [and risked our necks]ever stop to consider this.Even if we were to start levying tax on weekly Grotto meetings and collectingfifty cents a head [we’re notplanning to, although any number of other organizations would], what would bewrong with that?It is very galling to us that most of our membership seem to think that anyprofits made by the Churchgo directly into Ma and Pa LaVey’s personal piggy bank, when in reality exactlythe opposite is true. This isundoubtedly beginning to sound rather mercenary, but the simple fact of thematter is that we don’t relishthe prospect of spending several more years beating our brains out for amembership comprised largely ofthe sort of individuals who personify the characters in one of my favoritechildren’s stories, “The Little RedHen”.- 150 -Were we willing to “cop out” and start manufacturing Church of Satanpropeller-beanies, do-it-yourselfritual kits, and genuine, stimulated (sic) mother-of-pearl Satan statues, wecould make a mint off the nameand reputation we’ve created. But, as it happens, we really do believe in theChurch as it was originallyconceived, although we refuse to become martyrs - and hypocrites - over it.[Practice what you preach, andall that.]249The first thing the new Hoof Editor needed was a quarter-page masthead, and Iturned to Janet, whocreated a bat-winged, Miltonian Satan hurling bolts of fire across the page toform the blazing words“Cloven Hoof”. Diane told Janet, however, that Anton had decided to do the newmasthead himself. A fewdays later she wrote to me:I’m afraid finesse is not one of my talents when I have to think and commentquickly, and I knew I hadprobably stuck both feet and an arm in my mouth when I told Jan of the Doctor’sdecision and the reasonsfor same. It has bothered me every day since I talked to her about it. I thoughtabout writing her a noteexplaining my feelings, but how do you say “I’m sorry I told the truth but saidit in such an indelicate,blatant way that the way I said it made it untrue”?I distinctly recall saying that her drawing looked as if a girl had done it,which was a pretty crummyway of saying it wasn’t bold or dominant enough to convey a bold, Satanicimpression for a year’s time.Damn! I still can’t say what I really mean. Oh, for the guile and eloquence ofW.W.I think what I mean is that it is fine for the present, and certainlyartistically valid by any standard ofmeasurement; but knowing what I do about the future plans of the Church, I guessI should have said thatthe masthead should be overcompensatory insofar as “boldness” is concerned. Inmagical terminology Isuppose it would be called “a blueprint for the ‘is to be’”. Not that we’re allgoing to grow goat’s heads,cloven hooves, or wings!I’m speaking only in terms of William Mortensen’s formula of “is, not does” 250as applied to depictingstrength in art, and I don’t mean to imply that Janet’s Devil lacked Satanicmeaning. His stance, expression,and dæmonic physical attributes are highly Satanic and convey the impression offorging ahead! I alsoremember saying that it wouldn’t be so critical if the Doctor were not an artisthimself, thereby implyingthat he sets himself up as supreme critic of all things artistic. This certainlyis not true; he carried on toeveryone about Janet’s “hidden talent” after receiving the first issue of theBlacklist bearing her coverdesign. 251I have recounted Diane’s diplomacy on this matter because of its exotic andamusing aftermath: Whatcame from Anton was a magnificently hideous Baphomet goat-dæmon, whose mostinescapable featurewas a hairy, erect phallus. Accompanying it was a letter in which the artistdescribed his creation:For the masthead my prime thought was that the design employed shouldincorporate cloven hooves,thereby reinforcing the image conveyed by the title. After drawing a successionof devils, most lookingeither like fugitives from a tin of ham or third rate opera company rejects fromFaust auditions, I started arather panoramic thing showing a Devil’s herd, a la “Ghost Riders”, gallopingacross the top of the page.My intentions were the best, but alas, the page was too small, and what startedas a DeMille-typehippodrome petered out to a shopping center dog and pony circus.A stylized version of Baphomet was decided upon because I felt that Levi’sversion, while luridlygraphic for the nineteenth century, is far too euphemistic for today’s climate.Such concessions as the ill-fitted “good” pentagram on the forehead, the caduceus in lieu of a virilemember, the lap robe to avoidexposure of the caduceus’ point of origin, a rather unimaginative pair of 39D-cup mammary glands, armsthat would better serve in an ad for Jergens Lotion, a right hand apparently inthe act of hailing a cab, and a249 Ibid.250 In The Command to Look. See Appendix #19.251 Ibid., October 26, VI/1971.[index-151_1.jpg]- 151 -Roman candle perched atop the head do little to advance the impression of thetruly base and carnal aspectof the Beast of the World.I have attempted to beef up the aforementioned and drawn the horns in the mannerof certain easternand African wild goats rather than the usual, domestic variety. The membranouswings and scales have beenadded to graphically intensify the Hellish origin.Use your own judgment as to the color rendition. I have enclosed a couple ofsuggestions. Using red inonly the eyes and the smoke from the cranial exhaust (mistakenly assumed by mostoccultists to be somesort of candle) would certainly give the impression of a head “filled up withburning mist and golden mire”as well as direct the reader’s gaze towards the title. Allusions to red, blazingeyes can be found throughoutthe lore of Satan, from the ghouls and afrits of Persia to Dracula himself. Or,if you feel it is more strikingin black and white, please don’t hesitate to forgo color altogether. I amfrankly undecided. Diane preferseither the plain black and white or black and white with just the touch of redin the eyes and smoke. I’llleave it up to you and Janet to decide. 252We decided to go with the all-red version, and it thus heralded all Hoofs untilJune of 1972. Theseeditions were run off by mimeograph in our Louisville basement and mailed out tothe Churchmembership once a month. It will quickly be deduced by the reader that thiswould have been quite a taskfor a 7,000-strong mailing list, and so it would have been - but it wasn’t, asthe actual mailing list was 270names in length. I wondered whether I should be bothered by this bit ofdeception, but I concluded that noone was actually being harmed or exploited by it - and that the larger, mythicalfigure was handy to haveto intimidate persons who might otherwise attempt to harm the Church or itsmembers.My first issue as Editor - November VI/1971 - contained three essays of mine(Appendices #31-33), anaccount of the First Eastern Regional Conference of the Church [see Chapter#16], and an essay by Antonentitled “Mighty Casey Strikes Out -or- A Satanic Glimpse of the Future”. Histheme was that contact,team-type sports were doomed to extinction in favor of individualistic forms ofathletics:As more emphasis is placed upon independence, so individual expression mustflourish. Even thoughthe masses will always find security within their own mass, the need forindividual recognition still burnsbrightly in everyone. Christianity has stifled individuality, with conformitytouted as desirable, as anobvious means of control. Planned social activities such as team sports placedgreater importance oninvolvement than on prowess. The champion was considered a hero, but few couldbe champions, soinvolvement was all that was expected. The game of life was played on amicrocosmic level. Unfortunately252 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 23, VI/1971.- 152 -the highest standards of the participants were well below those of themanipulators who planned andencouraged the games!Now that man desires to be his own god, the same microcosmic principle appliesin his recent choicesof sports. He becomes his own team, a quasi-unique entity. He races stock cars,motorcycles, dune buggies,and slot cars. He jumps from airplanes. He dives beneath the sea. He ridessurfboards. He strives to extractwilder sounds from electronic musical instruments than the next guy.And in every instance of what might be called “the new sporting blood”,uniqueness of appearance andindividuality of expression are the criteria. Compare the initial attraction ofriding a custom-appearingmotorcycle with that engendered by donning a football uniform which looks likeeveryone else’s. Though askin-diver’s suit may resemble the others around him, the wondrous solitude andserenity he finds beneaththe surface more than compensate in exalting (or submerging) him to a uniqueposition. 253I also ventured a couple of movie reviews (Appendix #34), but on the whole theHoof would steerclear of Hollywood Satanism until something called The Exorcist came along [seeChapter #29].Reaction to the new newsletter was very favorable; letters and comments began tocome in from allover the country. A commendation arrived from Anton:As might be expected, this congratulatory note is tardy, but only because of mybacklog and your quietefficiency. If something had been remiss in the new Cloven Hoof, chances aregood I would have had tovoice my complaints immediately! One of the pitfalls of doing a job well aroundthose who love tranquilityis that it contributes to the smooth flow that is all to often interrupted byacts of ignorance and indiscretionperpetrated by others, often postponing recognition where deserved. As thesqueaking wheel gets the oiling,so the problem makers always receive “attention” before the problem solvers! Atany rate, the C.H. issuperb, the prospect of future issues bright, and the response totally positive.There is no doubt that it standsfar above anything else in its genre. Congratulations on a fine job. 254I quickly saw what Diane had been driving at, however, when she had referred tothe difficulty offilling entire issues with membership contributions; there just weren’t any tospeak of. The Hoof wouldreceive perhaps 20 letters a month containing chitchat or incidental items ofnews, but of extended essaymaterial there was almost nothing. The essays that did arrive got printed[unless they advocated the joys ofnecrophilia or something worse], but as my Editorship continued I got into thehabit of writing the bulk ofeach issue myself, omitting my name from articles to make the fact lessconspicuous. I hoped that, after Ihad “primed the pump” for a few months, hidden intellectual talents would emergeamong themembership and some good material would be contributed. And that is more or lesswhat transpired,though not to the degree I might have wished.The December 1971 issue consisted of essays by me on the Great Pyramid (Appendix#35) andChristmas (Appendix #36), an essay by Janet on the conspiratorial methods of theoriginal Jesuits, and anessay by John DeHaven II° warning Satanists against the press’ tendency to lookfor the worst in “Devilworshippers”. January 1972’s issue began with a satire of southern evangelism byJanet, after which Icontributed an article on vampirism (Appendix #37) and a short sketch ofPythagoras (Appendix #38).Anton’s essay was entitled “Occult Pornography”, and it highlighted thedesperate impulse of people tobelieve in something - anything - in an age in which the old myths have beendiscredited or destroyed:Now that God is dead and the old storytellers are being ridiculed, what newtales can be told tostimulate the demons within each brain, thus actuating and sustaining computerssolely programmed forhindsight? The Satanic Masters have decreed that the Dark Side shall provide thenew mythos, and firsthandfantasy shall be every man’s elective, and such fantasies may appear in diverseforms, each to one’s own253 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, November VI/1971.254 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 22, VI/1971.- 153 -taste. The wild talents of the priests of the god-houses can now belong to all,for what the stars do notsupply the pasteboards will.Why do they not tell of us as we would wish? Because it requires a far worseform of confrontationthan their encounter groups provide. We are reality, stripped of all fantasy,save for that which we canrecognize as such and employ as tools toward our well-being. If Satan is theFather of Lies, it is onlybecause they have made him so. Satan has spoken truth, but the truth hurts. SoHe soothes the hurt byplacing doctors of divinity and medicine-men upon the Earth to ease the threatof revelation through thephylactery of fantasy. For those who can bear the pain of their existence, joyawaits. 255By the beginning of 1972 several individuals who, having been II° Witches orWarlocks for sometime, felt that they should now be entitled to the Priesthood of Mendes III°. OnJanuary 6 Anton wrote tome (now IV°) as follows:I had intended to present an article for publication in the Cloven Hoof whichwould shed some much-needed light on the requirements for the Priesthood. Certain measures of tactand, I suppose, concern overthe possible results of what would easily be interpreted [and correctly so] aswrath on my part, make itnecessary to ponder the manner in which the subject should be advanced.Just how does one state the following bits of everyday logic?Every candidate for the Priesthood must serve an apprenticeship at the CentralGrotto, during which hisbehavior is observed under various conditions.Seminarial preparations and qualification are rigorous for those attempting toenter the priesthood ofany other established religion, so why should they not be equally rigid in theChurch of Satan? Why shouldit be easier to become a Priest of Satan than it is to become a Catholic priest,a Jewish rabbi, or a Methodistminister, when a Priest of Satan actually requires a great deal more wisdom,considering his terrestrialcommitment? How do we tell them that initiative is wonderful, but that it cannever take the place of ability,and that a proficiency in the latter quality will surely have been made manifestin their pre-III° applicationactivities?Mike, we are dealing with grown-up little boys who wish to be big shots andpathetically think that therules of the game (verifiable resumés, credit checks, occupational, residential,familial, and emotionalstability) do not apply here, but that the passing of a test is all thatmatters. They simply cannot divorcethemselves from the climate of the childhood vacant lot fraternity, thoughoutside the Church they acceptthe rules of the game from prospective employers, loan companies, etc. withoutquestion.Maybe I’m wrong, but I think a man who bears the portentous title of Priest ofMendes should be ableto buy a ticket to San Francisco [not hitchhike], check in at a decent hotel[without depending on the C.G.staff to find him one!], and show other examples of worldly resourcefulness,such as spelling gud, maybetaking the High Priest and High Priestess out for a hot dog, and additionalintellectual feats and socialgraces.I was once astounded at the effrontery of many aspirants to the Priesthood; nowI have simply becomeinured to such copious amounts of cheekiness. Clearly what our problem childrenof the Church lack mostis introspection and genuine self-evaluation. I base my standards of tact,protocol, and true respect for thoseI feel deserve it on the very selfish premise that “it’s the only way I ever gotanywhere!”Perhaps I have read too many Horatio Alger novels, but in this epic, as in all,the Devil is a gentlemanwho knows how to say “sir”, address a fellow as “mister” even if the man’s agarbage man (sanitationengineer), praise others without choking on the words, and generally display thesound and secure ego forwhich the Prince of Darkness is noted. Contrary as it might seem to most, ittakes a great deal of personalpride to be genuinely humble.These are the things that cannot be - no, should not be - taught to our would-bePriests, for if suchqualities are not inherent, the aspirant is a bad risk. These requirements forthe Priesthood of Mendes, if sostated, would then combine “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus” with EmilyPost. I dislike hurtinganyone’s feelings, but we are well into our Fourth Phase and we’d best toughenour hides.255 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, January VII/1972.- 154 -As I have alluded, we will drop many of our “most dedicated” by the wayside, andumbrages - bothsmall and great - will be freely taken. What we will gain will be infinitelysuperior, as it has always been. Ifeel there is now enough of a solid foundation to establish a new andcomprehensive set of Priesthoodrequirements, exclusive of personality traits, which can and should be observedfirsthand.As for the actual requirements, other than a totally new test, which I wouldlike to compile fromquestions submitted by yourself and other knowledgeable III°+ members, as otherqualifications go, thefollowing should be given much consideration:- Job or professional stability.- Married or single (married with compatible spouse given preference).- Children (persons with children given preference).- Special abilities (languages, talents, etc., in which outstanding ability inat least one should bepresent).- Ability to maintain relationships (long-term friendships prior to entranceinto Church … if none,reasons).- Economic stability (assets/liabilities).- Residential stability (own or buying home? If not, why not?).- Family reaction (likelihood of problems arising from furious parents,children, inheritance lawyers,etc.).- Make and year of automobile.- Living conditions (type of home, outsider’s impression, style of decor).*- Personal appearance (preference given to above and beyond reproach, yetdistinctive appearance).*- Life-style (leisure pursuits, restaurants frequented, etc.).- Pets (preference given to pet owners).- Conversational ability (non-esoteric versatility a must).*These are a few ideas. If you can come up with others - or properly word these -I will be most grateful.My plan is to spring these requirements on those who already have our old test,should they submit it.Naturally I wish “preference given to” omitted from requirement questionnaireswhich are sent toaspirants. Otherwise we will have them running out and buying dogs they can’tstand, marrying spousesthey can’t stand, and eating food they can’t stand at restaurants they can’tafford.Items marked with an asterisk are observable chiefly through personal contactwith the aspirant, to bemade by a Magister or other qualified O.T. investigator.Bearing in mind that rigid rules are always made for the many, who require them,rather than for thefew, most requirements are subject to modification under the proper conditions.Of course most of those who aspire to the Priesthood in a persistent manner areseldom those whoseactions speak louder than their words. Thus a list of requirements must be toughenough to boggle the bigtalker and presumptuous upstart. The best potential Priests and Priestesses willbe selected to take the test,as it should be.256To Anton I responded:I couldn’t agree with you more strongly concerning the Priesthood. Whenever themembers in thisregion have discussed the III°, they have likened it to merely “the next rung”on the ladder of prestigewithin the Church. You pass your II° test and buy a white Baphomet, and then youpass your III° test andbuy a black Baphomet, and so on, presumably, until you get a trident and horns!More often than not my careful explanations of the differences between laymembership and the Orderof the Trapezoid have been greeted with disgruntlement. In order to clear up theconfusion, I have beenplanning an article on the structure of the Church, tentatively for inclusion inthe February Cloven Hoof. Itwill be “censored” to the point where it can be read by the general membership,but I will nevertheless staffthe article through your office for approval before I cut the final stencil.As for the standards of admission to the Black Order, they should be geared torecognize those who areSatanists, not to allow individuals with inferiority complexes to embellishtheir egos with an arcane title.256 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 6, VII/1972.- 155 -Paradoxically, though, the latter are always the more vehement in their pursuitof the Priesthood; the formeroften elude identification or at least formal recognition.I would like to spend some time working on the basic requirements you set forth.Let me see if I can’tforward an analysis within the next month, together with some ideas for the III°examination. I would liketo give both some careful thought. 257Before the draft of my Hoof article was reviewed, Anton sent me some additionalthoughts concerningthe Grotto system and the Priesthood:I have decided on two moves towards a more controllable administration.The first: All Grotto authorizations will be dated on a six-month basis. A yearis too long a test period,and it is much easier and “cleaner” to (a) simply not renew an unsuitableauthorization (Peter Principle fail-safe) than it is to (b) yank a charter after seven or eight months ofincompetence (punitive measure).Psychologically #a will be accepted as a means of getting off the hook, for boththe Church and theincapable Grotto Leader, whereas #b engenders hostility and defensiveness.The second modification is a probationary period of one year from the date of aPriest’s acceptance andinstallation into office to his formal ordination. This means that, upon meetingthe necessary requirementsfor the Priesthood, the candidate will assume the capacity of Priest, beingaddressed by that title,functioning as such, and wearing the raiment of same. No certificate will beissued, however, until thefulfillment of one year’s required conduct.I realize this may appear harsh, but it is no worse than most apprenticeships inother religious orders.Instead of serving in residence in San Francisco, which is - at least at thistime - impractical, prowess can bediscerned over one year’s time on a pastoral level. A pilgrimage to S.F. shouldstill be required beforeinstallation in order that the candidate may be observed firsthand. In short, ayear of probation willsubstitute for seminarial residency.Another aspect I have contemplated is a system of merits and demerits, whereby atangible evaluationof behavior might be effected, resulting in probationary advancement, scrutiny,and final acceptance orrejection. Whether or not such an evaluation program should be made known isopen to debate. On the sideof open knowledge of same is the element of watchdog control. If a member isaware, via known, tangiblestandards of evaluation, that his actions are acceptable insofar as he does hishomework, we might haveeveryone doing the right thing - but out of regulation rather than inspiration.Is this what we really want?Will our “elite” group be elite on the strength of rote-learning and fear offailure, or because it would be thatway anyway? I should prefer the latter, at least occupying the clergy.This is why I have always preferred the “entrapment” school of human evaluation.Temptation is a finetest of quality, and “enough rope” will bring out most imperfections. If throughignorance or succumbing totemptation one has blundered, there exists a useful test of humility, for itpresents a situation whereby one’sability to “kick himself” may be discerned. Unless one can constructively - notmasochistically - dealhimself a swift kick upon making an avoidable mistake, he will never learn much.Perhaps “leaks” that such a system of evaluation exists, without divulgingspecifics, is the answer. Ithink that such a method of observation, and subsequent merit or demerit, shouldexist for the Council’suse; all that remains is to decide which of the two described above [oralternate suggestion] will best serveour purpose. I invite your comments. 258The upshot of this dialogue was my first major article on the Church’s degreesystem (Appendix #39).It appeared in the March 1972 Hoof, together with an essay of mine on the Grail(Appendix #40) and areprint of the newly-revised [by Anton] Church of Satan information statement toprospective members(Appendix #41). Anton’s official essay for the issue focused again on theintegrity of the SatanicPriesthood:257 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, January 13, VII/1972.258 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 27, VII/1972.- 156 -Other religions have had thousands of years to construct a wall of righteousimmunity with which tosurround themselves, though they have fought, one against the other. Theirpriests can nefariously use theirprestigious positions, for, even though their deceit is visible, so are thedeceits of those who are empoweredto criticize them. Hence nothing is said. Our Priests’ shortcomings will also bevisible, but many voiceswill be raised in criticism, for such criticism is justified when it attacks theDevil.Our Priests must be superior human beings.To attack our detractors is easy. Any Satanist will find them to be small andunfair game; he will receiveno trophies upon bagging the limit. Such sport can be entered into by the mostfledgling Satanist, armedwith a modicum of logic and a pantheon of Satanic deities from which to draw, ina tournament of fantasy.The Priest of Mendes, however, is a lion in the path of those whose onlyjustification for living rests on theiradherence to the side of “goodness”. The Satanic Priest will be observed in allaspects of his “evilness”,whether it be a pick of the nose or an unmown lawn. Our Priests and Priestesses- like Cæsar’s wife - can dono wrong.The Priesthood of the Church of Satan requires far more perfection of itscandidates than do thepriesthoods of other religions, for the Priest or Priestess of Satan is thefoundation of modern Satanism. Aswe grow, there is less room for marginal persons within the Church. As weprogress, standards of leadershipare tightened - not only because we become a brighter object of scrutiny, butbecause of increasingly higherqualifications possessed by new members.This is not to imply that Satanic clergy must be simon pure in word and deed. Itmeans that the Priest ofSatan must be better-read, more self-aware, more achieved for his years, morearticulate, and moregenuinely dedicated to his chosen faith than are the clergy of any otherreligion known to man.We are living in a fleeting, but Satanically necessary period of “paperpriests”, whereby anyone canbecome endowed with legitimate secular authority for a few dollars.I must confess that I have encouraged such antics - by both overt and covertmachinations. Those whocan conceive of the method and the results will understand my plan. It will cometo pass that the Satanistwill attain legitimacy through exclusion. 259I call particular attention to these two articles - the message from Anton(above) and Appendix #41 - aswell as to the quoted correspondence from him as exemplary of the rigor withwhich he defended theintegrity of the Satanic Priesthood during the decade of the Church’s existence.One will note that hisapproach was one of seeking and encouraging constructive criticism from seniorofficials of the Church asto ways to improve the ordination procedure; he did not consider himself eitherinfallible or omniscient onthis subject.Also in the March Hoof was a letter to the Editor in response to an H.P.Lovecraft-theme poem which Ihad included in the February issue. The letter read:Concern’g ye Chaunt of ye Strange Angles from ye Booke of ye Arab Alhazred whichour esteem’dBrother, Warlock John Dee, did submit in ye preced’g issue: I was muchastonish’d thereat, for I hadthought mine own copy of Al-Azif to be ye Last.

Billington, Gent. (Warlock, SZZ-927)This epistle prompt’d still another letter to the Editor in the April Hoof, thisone from a member on theeast coast named Phyllis Rose:259 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, March VII/1972.- 157 -Regarding the March Cloven Hoof - the letter from A. Billington: “His” book, AlAzif or theNecronomicon does not exist. I took the initiative to write to him … I couldhardly type to Mr. Billington Iwas laughing so hard. Anyway I did not try to offend him, for I have a friendwho also takes the CthulhuMythos seriously … You probably know the book is a myth unless the letter was ajoke. But in case youdon’t, don’t try to get a copy - you’ll never find one!This letter was followed by a comment from one of my Contributing Editors:The young lady is entirely correct. There is no such work as the Necronomicon,and the so-called“Cthulhu Mythos” is a literary invention of the over-imaginative Lovecraft. Deeand Billington would dowell to discern fact from fantasy in the future.Nyarlathotep“Dee” and “Billington”, as it turned out, had unleashed an even worse horrorthan the Gr. Old Ones onthe Church of Satan - a previously dormant II° (!) Pennsylvania entity by thename of Wayne Chojnicki. InFebruary he wrote to a bewildered Arthur Zabrecky (his Regional Agent):In the most recent edition of the C.H. is a work supposedly composed by JohnDee, SZZ something orother; the work is entitled “The Chant of Strange Angles”. It is my sad duty tohave to announce at this timethat, unless Mr. Dee is contacted and a sufficiently plausible reason for thepublication of said “chant” isfurnished to me, I and my order do hereby declare and pronounce a fate worsethan death on one John Dee -the reason for such drastic action being that because of his lack of Satanicwisdom he, through theoverindulgence of his ego, has placed in the hands of hundreds of unsuspectingmembers of the Church ofSatan a possible means not only for their own destruction but also that of theChurch.The “Chant” is but a prelude or preparatory for a working involving the openingof a time gate, a warpin which are imprisoned a series of elementals who by violent means would renderman into bondage. Theentire working goes under the title of the Dhol (sic) Chants. The originalcopies of said Chants are part ofthe Aklo Tables, which also warn strongly against the release of said beings.These beings are not to beconfused with the nature deities of old or even the supreme countenance ofLucifer himself. For “Lucifer” isbut the Hebrew Semitic name for the eldritch deity Shub-Niggarth (sic) ofLovecraftian fame. This is towhom the Church has ties (if any) in the format of a deitific figurehead,because S.N. is translated into theBlack Goat of a Thousand Young. Sound vaguely like the Goat of Mendes? However,John Dee advocatesutilization of 1/4 of the Dhol Chants by practitioners of our Church, who do notand at this time cannotcomprehend what would be required to rid themselves of the plague which wouldnot only triumph over theChristian do-gooders but our people too. These beings are not the Angels(angles) of Revelation of whichDr. LaVey speaks, as John Dee supposes, but are the antithesis of everything ourSatanic lifestyle advocates.Do now what I request, for the internal security of the Church, or I’ll have tohold you too responsiblefor this abomination. Don’t make me harm you. I’ll be expecting some reply in 3weeks or less. The counterspell will be evoked at the end of that time, with a corrolary (sic) spell topunish x3 those responsible forendangering this many of our people. This oath I make: “By the services of theUnspeakable Hastur andMaskim 7x7, and lastly that which is unnamable, what I have said will be done!Shemhamforash! So moteit be!”Vade retro Pan!Wayne Chojnicki260Art Zabrecky was a rather affable gentleman who lived in Cleveland, Ohio anddealt in antiques. Hewrote to me in some bewilderment: “Rather than go into detail, please read theenclosed material. Perhapsyou can offer some advice. Will be looking forward to hearing from you.” 261260 Letter, Wayne Chojnicki to Arthur Zabrecky, February 17, VII/1972.261 Letter, Arthur Zabrecky to M.A. Aquino, February 22, VII/1972.- 158 -Approximately a week before this, as is recounted in Chapter #16, the Church hadundergone its mostserious crisis to date - that of the dissolution of the Stygian Grotto inCenterville, Ohio. It had been a verytrying episode, and as Anton LaVey’s action official in the case, I had beenright in the middle of it. Onone hand I was printing policy statements from the High Priest proclaiming thehighest of standards forthe Church and its clergy; on the other there seemed to be no end of stupidlittle scandals to mock thosestandards. Thus Chojnicki’s epistle appeared before me at precisely the wrongtime; he seemedrepresentative of every rat in the Church of Satan’s woodpile. To him I wrote:The insolence and foolishness of your letter to Mr. Zabrecky preclude a seriousreply to yourarguments. Needless to say, we are not impressed. It is not your place to advisethe Church of Satan onmatters of ethics, nor have you the right to subject our Regional Agent to suchdrivel. You will send a letterto Mr. Zabrecky in which you express your personal apologies for such conduct.You will send a copy of theletter to my office as well. And if I should ever hear of your threateninganother member of the Churchagain, you will have to answer to me. 262I should have known better what I was letting myself in for. Chojnicki’s answerreached me soonthereafter:You may drop this air of pompous indignation and recognize the fact that thehonor of bearing thefourth level “bishop” status in the Church confers (sic) to me that you haveachieved a certain proficiency inthe realm of Contemporary Satanism, both ethics and ritual. This degree has itsparellels (sic) in otherorders (which the Church chooses not to recognize), as in the title of “MasterSpecialist” in the InternationalBrotherhood of Shadows, which in effect means that you are competent only incertain fields. You made nomention that you have even heard of the term “Primal Magic” and as such, while Irespect your statuswithin your field, your rather heated reply serves only to disappoint me.However I’m willing to overlookthis scare tactic and offer to instruct you as to the reasons for my priorstrong request for an inquest,providing the following is done. First, I receive written confirmation that youhave exercised a reasonableamount of your authority to secure from Mr. J. Dee a deposition as to the originand use of his piece of theDhole Chants and secondly that the C.H. publish a follow-up asking any one toreport any effects or resultsachieved by the afformentioned (sic) chants (preferably one which would notarrouse (sic) excess curiosity).On these grounds I will, in return, drop the hopefully unnecessary strong-armtactics and you may evenlearn something shall we say “usefull” (sic). You see you also have the optionof having me removed fromthe membership and/or choosing to do battle psychically or otherwise.Rege, Ave, Hail SATAN!Ia Shub-Niggarh!

When that article appeared, I voiced my annoyance via thefollowing letter to the Editor:After reading your comments concerning the Church of Satan, I am forced tosuspect that yourmagazine’s interests are more sensational than objective.Your implication that “most of those convicted of the killings have demonstratedsome kind ofinvolvement with the Church of Satan” is both unsubstantiated and factuallyunfounded. Nor does AntonLaVey espouse any of the racist or totalitarian theories of the Nazis, as yourreporter subsequentlysuggested. If Satanism seems grotesque in the eyes of the pompous professionalsof existing theologicalinstitutions, perhaps it is because we portray man as the crude, impulsiveanimal that he is rather than as adivinely-inspired image of a beneficent god. In view of the Christian religion’sbloody record of persecutionand suppression of other faiths, it takes some nerve for its present-dayproponents to voice accusationsagainst the Church of Satan.As for White witchcraft, I suppose that intoning nursery rhymes in the nude isall right if you go in forthat sort of thing. It may be æsthetically pleasing to both participants andspectators, but it is intellectuallyinconsequential. Whether you pray to a god named Jupiter or to one named Jehovahis unimportant; the factthat you pray at all, however, marks you as a person who is attempting to refuseresponsibility for his owndecisions. 268In the September 1971 Hoof “John M. Kincaid” had reacted somewhat more mildly tothe Newsweekcoverage:The Newsweek article contains much food for thought, if read by discriminatingpersons, with its majorweakness accountable to the “expert” opinions of assorted pulpiteers andtheologians who, it is assumed,know all the answers concerning Satanism. Asking a Christian clergyman aboutSatanism is akin to takingone’s car to a wrecking yard if the carburetor is out of adjustment, on thepremise that an auto wreckerspecializes in cars that don’t run. 269Rather unsatisfied with “Kincaid’s” comments, I wrote to “him”:I hope that the Central Grotto didn’t dismiss the Newsweek article as being allthat inconsequential. Ithas caused us a great deal of trouble here. The outright insinuations that theChurch even obliquelyencourages ritual murder, and that Dr. LaVey is a latter-day Nazi are hardly thesort of things we can glossover. Read that article again from the standpoint of a person who knows nothingabout the Church; you will267 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Wayne Chojnicki, March 7, VII/1972.268 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Newsweek, August 17, VI/1971.269 “John M. Kincaid” in Cloven Hoof, August VI/1971.- 161 -find it to be extremely vicious. I for one don’t think we ought to turn theother cheek to some smugNewsweek editor. 270Diane’s reply a few days later sheds considerable light on the LaVeys’ growingdisillusionment withthe Church’s continuing treatment by the media. [Recall that, in the early daysof the Church’s turntowards greater sophistication, correspondingly kinder reviews had beenanticipated.] To me Diane wrote:The Central Grotto certainly did not dismiss the Newsweek article as beinginconsequential! As amatter of fact, it has [along with several other pieces on the Church] nearlyresulted in an immovablecurtain being dropped between the media and the Church.So embittered is the Master by the media’s apparent need to wear the “good guybadge”, therebyconcealing their own weaknesses and often-dubious personal motivations, thatsince the Look andNewsweek articles I have been unable to talk him into a single interview orpersonal appearance. Hisattitude is: “If they insist on using me as a scapegoat so they can patthemselves on the back for ‘exposing’the evils of Satanism, they are just going to have to find themselves anotherDevil (or sin-eater).” I don’tknow just how long he will continue this, but he’s not showing any signs ofbudging at the moment.In case your comments on the article were prompted by the lack of a request fromhim for members ofthe clergy to write letters of rebuttal, it’s because he assumed they wouldanyway. The Fate matter [Note:See Appendix #43 - M.A.] was a different story, because what self-respectingPriest of Mendes reads Fate?I must admit, though, that we were rather surprised by what appears to beextreme worriment on yourpart over the article. Regarding the first piece Newsweek did on the Church, Irecall that when the Masterwas so enraged over what was said, it was you who convinced him that heshouldn’t be so concerned over it- that most people will only remember his picture, name (spelled right), and thename Newsweek. And hefeels that, if anything, this current story gave the average person more correctinformation than the last, andthat the above-average person would surely read between the lines and find adistinction had been madebetween the C of S and those so-called “Satanists” who engage in ritual murder.Nevertheless we all agree that any point given in our favor was givengrudgingly. Unfortunately,though, they did not come right out and say anything that could be cited asslanderous were we to bringlegal action against them. Every attorney with whom I’ve ever discussed thissort of thing says that slanderis probably the most difficult offense to prove, and that, even if proven, youmust prove financial loss as aresult of it in order to obtain judgment against the offender. Perhaps now youcan understand why theMaster isn’t exactly keen on giving any more time to the press. They saywhatever they please, anyway, sowhy bother? 271And so, when casting around for a lead article topic for the April 1972 Hoof, Idecided to take on theNazism allegations (Appendix #44). Then I launched into my most extensive bookreview to date - on thesubject of Colin Wilson’s just-released The Occult (Appendix #45).The May/June (combined) issue was the last of the “red goat” issues of the Hoof,both because Janetand I were moving from Kentucky to Santa Barbara, California and because adecision had been taken toupgrade the Hoof to a digest-style printed format. The May/June issue, in anycase, was the best of the“red goats”, containing many good articles, poems, essays, and letters frommembers. The pump, itappeared, had been primed; I wrote only six out of the twenty pages, and most ofthose six pages consistedof announcements and reports of current events. The only feature article I wrotewas entitled “Darwin andthe Devil” (Appendix #46).Anton’s essay for the May/June Hoof was again a major theoretical statemententitled “Working atHaving Fun”. Shaking his head at the clenched-teeth determination of the averageperson to “enjoyhimself” in fixed ways during fixed times on fixed days, Anton predicted thatincreasing diffusion ofbusiness hours throughout the week would eventually cause “commercial” holidaysto “wither away”. [A270 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John M. Kincaid, September 20, VI/1971.271 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 24, VI/1971.- 162 -decade later, holidays in the United States were in fact rearranged to “extend”weekends rather thancommemorate precise historical dates!] Anton concluded:In the future Age of Satan, pride in accomplishment will emerge out of wholesaleindolence, becausethe doer - the creator - will be set apart from his drone-like fellows.Redundant as it appears, pride inaccomplishment will itself be cause for pride. Thus the achiever need not workat having fun, but will havefun in working. Sound crazy? Just look around you. Those with the greatestopportunities for indolence areinvariably those who take up the most time-consuming and involved projects. Thewealthy matron whospends long hours at volunteer work does it because (a) everyone will see howwonderful she is, (b) shewon’t feel guilty at being so rich, and (c) she will justify her existence as aproductive human being. In afew years she, as well as her less pecuniary human brothers and sisters, willonly consider the last reason.Satanism advocates indulgence instead of abstinence. If you “indulge” yourselfsolely on the premisethat it is the Satanic thing to do, you are playing the same game as theChristian who hangs one on everySaturday night or battles mosquitoes at a Sunday picnic. If Satanism provides acredo by which you canthoroughly enjoy sought-for pleasure, then revel in your senses.If, however, you indulge yourself by Satanic prescription, waiting for positiveresults after eachcarefully programmed joy ride, forget it. You are probably quite secure in yourabstinence, and to realizethat is infinitely more Satanic than the misgivings that ill-contrivedself-indulgence will produce. Theapprehension you could experience after an overdose of programmed joy might evenland you back in thenearest church of the other side. I have seen it happen. 272272 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, May/June VII/1972.[index-163_1.jpg][index-163_2.jpg]- 163 -On July 21, 1971 I officiated at the first marriage within the Church of Satansince the celebratedRaymond-Case wedding in San Francisco in 1967 [see Chapter #3]. Now at theNineveh Grotto two of itsmembers were married to become Vicki and James Peyton. For the occasion thenormally-foreboding altarwas covered with white flowers, and, as James placed the ring on Vicki’s finger,their two hands weremomentarily enveloped in a burst of Hellish flame. [Since the Black Mass at6114, I had become a littlemore skillful in my employment of Dragon’s Breath.] The text of the officialChurch of Satan weddingceremony, as used at the Raymond and Peyton weddings, is included as Appendix#47.An amusing interlude had preceded the actual ceremony. In Kentucky all clergywho desire tosolemnize weddings must first be licensed by the county - in this case JeffersonCounty, whichincorporated the city of Louisville. On July 12, County Clerk James Hallahan wasrather taken aback by abright red certificate of ordination which announced:[index-164_1.jpg]- 164 -Hallahan placed a hurried telephone call to the District Attorney, who, no doubtenjoying the plight ofhis fellow bureaucrat, assured him that it was all quite legal. The license wasduly issued:Until 1971 the Church of Satan functioned extemporaneously outside of SanFrancisco. It had beentaken for granted that new Grottos would simply follow the lead of the CentralGrotto in managing theiraffairs, with no other reference than the Satanic Bible being necessary. But,even before the breakup ofBabylon, it began to be apparent that some administrative guidelines would beneeded, and so the LaVeysrequested me to rough out a draft. This I did, sending copies not only to SanFrancisco but also to WayneWest for his comments. The Manual for Grotto Administration, as it would becalled, was intended to be amimeographed booklet covering such areas of general concern as Grotto formation,organization,membership, programs, ritual activities, publications, and public relations. OnJuly 5 I sent the draftManual to San Francisco, and Diane LaVey wrote back:The Manual for Grotto Administration is terrific! We went over it and came upwith only a fewcorrections which will not alter the excellent format but will prevent anypossible misunderstandings:The word “few” should replace “no” with regard to directives. There will beoccasional directives,although you never received any. Not everyone has your superior sense of goodjudgment, and we mustmaintain a certain degree of control over Grotto activity.“Adept” should be “adept” in order to avoid confusion of titles. The use of aproper noun here wouldencourage members to use the term whether or not they were entitled to regardthemselves as such.The application fee is now $25 and annual renewal $15. The commission on newmembershipsrecruited by Grotto Leaders is $10, and for Agents it is $5. It just occurred tome that you probably thoughtwe had miscalculated the 20% Agent’s commission in the letter we sent to them,since you didn’t knowabout the price increase. Even though I flunked math, I rarely make a mistakewhen figuring money!“… best traditions of Dennis Wheatley” should be changed to read “… best Gothictradition”. We mustremember how literally most members interpret our instructions. We don’t wantthem sacrificing chickensand tying young virgins to inverted crosses!Something should be said here about the importance of appearing as leadersinstead of members of theflock.- 165 -In San Francisco and New York (as well as some other larger cities), the mostmind-blowing get-up aSatanist can wear is a Brooks Brothers suit, vest, and watch fob; whereas theuniform of the San Franciscoconformist (bell-bottoms, psychedelic-print shirt, and gold-rimmed glasses)might be just the thing to setone apart from the rustics in Butte, Montana.Weather, environmental conditions, occupation, etc. must of course beconsidered, but the main idea isto look respectable while intriguing! No matter where a member lives, though,the “hippie look” isdefinitely out!The unisex look should also be avoided. If one wants to look like the oppositesex, then he or sheshould adopt the appropriate dress; transvestitism is far more in keeping withthe Satanic way - at least it’snot hypocritical!You don’t have to include all this in the Manual, but it should be mentioned soyou’ll get an idea ofwhat we’re after in the proper Satanic dress.Rituals are to be open only to registered members. I don’t know what your rateof success has been inrecruiting individuals who have witnessed rituals prior to applying formembership, but it has proven mostunwise in the majority of cases. Much as you [and we] hate to admit it, mostpersons who are “deeplyinterested” turn out to be deeply interested in seeing a “free show” and willfeign sincere interest just to getin on the “goodies”, losing all interest once it’s been made easy for them to doso with no strings attached.Actually they often receive a false impression that we are not as serious asthey would like to think, bybeing so eager to snare new members with the lure of the ritual.In this regard I refer you to your own section on “Public Relations”: “Ignoranceis Strength!” No onewithout a membership card is to be admitted to rituals.We agree that nonmembers should be charged more for Grotto activities, butremember that this wouldnot apply to rituals to which they would not be admitted at all. Also, in orderto maintain the exclusivenessof the Church on the local level as well as here at the headquarters, nonmembersshould be allowed toattend only those activities which are specifically planned for them, such asintroductory lectures andpossibly informal discussions.If it sounds as though we’re becoming more business-minded, we are - and it’sabout time! We’ve gotsomething very valuable in the Church of Satan, and we are not about toentertain hordes of freeloaders justto cajole them into joining our elitist organization. Freeloaders arefreeloaders (psychically as well asfinancially), and they’ll not change once they’ve joined, if they ever do. Wedon’t need them!We heartily agree that a fee should be charged for Grotto activities, but wehave become a bit toomisanthropic in our old age to give the green light to shrewd, mercenaryindividuals who will undoubtedlyfind their way into positions of Grotto Leaders and use their office to milktheir members financially.A maximum fee should be set for normal Grotto functions (rituals, lectures,private counseling), andfunds for special activities (dinners, outings, etc.) should be strictlycontrolled, with receipts being kept forall expenses. For the usual Grotto activities the members can either donate whatthey wish [but, as youwisely pointed out, should be told such a collection will be taken], or may becharged a set “donation” asthe Grotto Leader so chooses. The set donation should not exceed $2 or $3. On“highholidays” (Walpurgisnacht and Halloween), when a large turnout is expected, $5should be tops.We are all for Grotto savings accounts, which would enable them to keep theirfinancial records up-to-date, take a great deal of responsibility off the shoulders of the Grotto Leader(who would otherwise have toworry about someone’s stealing funds out of the mattress or cookie jar), and ofcourse provide the fringebenefit of quarterly interest.Whether or not Anton and I would have to answer for any “miscalculations” in aGrotto’s checkingaccount is not the only point to consider. The reputation of the entire Churchwould be adversely affected byinefficient handling of such an account. The only way we could even considersuggesting that Grottos openchecking accounts would be to require two signatures on each check, with eitherAnton, myself, or JohnKincaid selecting the second signer (who naturally would not be a close friendof the Grotto Leader, butpossibly the treasurer or one who we felt could handle the responsibility).If this comes as a surprise to you in view of our enthusiasm for your idea whenyou opened the NinevehGrotto account, don’t forget that it was you who remained in control of thecheck-writing, and you have togo some to do anything to which the Master would object!- 166 -But there are a goodly number of Agents (prospective Grotto Leaders) who haven’tattained thetrustworthy position you have in our eyes. Be assured that we feel certainninety percent of those we’verecently selected would handle the responsibility very well, but we cannot beabsolutely certain of all - andall it takes, as they say, is one bad apple.I trust you can see our point on the financial issue. You undoubtedly believedyou had covered this inyour final paragraph in the section, but saying we’ll assume no liability forfinancial debt and leaving noopportunity for it to occur are two different matters; we prefer the latter.We’ve worked very hard for five years to come by any financial gain throughultra-ethical means anddon’t want our work to have been for naught, especially since the bulk (about75%) of the Church’sfinancial reserve has come from non-Church sources, i.e. the Master’s writing,lecturing, etc.The personal appearance honorariums should definitely be encouraged, especiallyif the speaker isamply qualified to speak with some degree of polish and a good deal of Satanicinsight. And this should bepartially the basis on which the proper fee is determined.Also to be considered, though, is the budget on which each group (school -grammar, Jr. high, high, orcollege - women’s club, Girl Scout troop, or “the opposition”) operates.Elementary schools usually have nofunds for speakers. Exceptions to this are usually found in private schools,where occasionally they’ll pay asmuch as a college. Jr. high schools have approximately the same budgets aselementary schools, butcolleges and universities will normally pay a decent fee, although they oftenmust be pressured into it.The honorarium for a school must also be commensurate with the size group andthe economic stratumof the neighborhood in which the school is located. The various clubs, broadcastmedia, and charitableorganizations must be considered individually, of course. Although we grant thatwe are not - nor should beexpected to be - good Samaritans, we would like to think that our GrottoLeaders’ and Agents’ first concernis the dissemination of correct information on the Church of Satan, notfinancial gain. So if a local boys’club can’t scrape together the requested fee, it should be the responsibility ofthe Church’s spokesmen to“spread a bit of good will” by giving at least a brief talk gratis to deserving“pauper” groups. 273When considering the part of the Manual describing the Church’s degree system, Iwas bothered bythe “Hollywood” image of the II° in particular. I suggested changing the I° toNeophyte and the II° toAdept, after the fashion of the Golden Dawn and its initiatory offshoots. Afterall, the IV° and V° titleshad clearly come from the (8)=[3] and (9)=[2] grades of the Golden Dawn. AntonLaVey, however,disagreed:The Manual for Grotto Administration looks very good; it will be extremelyvaluable to the growth ofthe Church in the months to come. The few corrections I have are, for the mostpart, minor ones. The onerather major issue is with regard to your proposed correction, i.e. “witch”,“warlock”, and other names witha “Hollywood” sound.You are absolutely correct in your feeling about the “ring” of these titles. Itis primarily the actual soundof them that is responsible for their being chosen. Psychologically speaking,“grotto” sounds better than“coven”; hence its use.Unfortunately you are far too sensitive and intelligent to succumb to the charmof the words “witch”,“warlock”, “sorcerer”, etc. The average consumer of magical bric-a-brac,however, responds much more tothese terms than to those employed by the Thelemites and other arcane orders.We must avoid the nomenclature of Crowley like the plague, as he has now becomea folk hero. Usingthe “witch”, “warlock”, etc. labels exonerates us from any copycat accusations,which are sure to be tossedshould we resort to Crowleyesque names. The “popular” labels will serve us bestbecause there is so muchdiscrepancy as to whose definition is correct. The fact that they are in thepublic domain allows us to evolvea fixed definition, due to our organized numbers and rational approach.With the Compleat Witch selling better each day and scheduled for a hugepaperback printing, it wouldbe folly to drop what is destined to be the last word on what a witch or warlockshould be. There will273 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, July 20, VI/1971.- 167 -always be those who have their own definitions of everything that comes along,but we can’t worry aboutthem.Please take my word for it, Mike - Our yardstick will be the one employed ascriteria for the titles ofwitch, wizard, etc. in the years to come, just as all the bickering fools areinsidiously picking up pieces ofwhat I have already said concerning their “own” beliefs.Eighteen years ago I was reciting Crowley and smearing myself with VanVan andPatchouli, much asour current crop of “Adepts”. Apparently the “ritual” worked, judging fromtoday’s reverberations.Hindsight is not for us to practice. We must either take that which cannot benailed down as an obviousbit of plagiarism or innovate. Thus we will be remembered as the pioneers wetruly are.I have seen the Promethean essence flower in you and feel I must nourish it withthe care and concern itdeserves. 274My final draft of the Manual for Grotto Administration was mimeographed anddistributed to existingand prospective Grottos a short time later, with an introduction added by Antonin which he observed:This Manual has been compiled as a result of intense study and observation. Itwill allow the GrottoLeader ample opportunity to develop both himself and his Grotto, whileinhibiting only those persons andsituations which have been proven disruptive. The strength of the Church ofSatan resides within thestability and self-awareness of its leaders, and simple rules such as containedherein are the tools of anyleader’s environment. 275The chapters concerning actual Grotto operations (i.e. not referring to theadministrative use of theManual itself) are included as Appendix #48.As I finished work on the Manual, one of the Nineveh Grotto members dropped byto show me a copyof the new textbook his collegiate anthropology class had just acquired. In itwas an article by JamesMoody, the Priest who had served as my deacon for the 6114 Black Mass. I turnedto the article, entitled“Urban Witches”, anticipating something more positive and personal than MarcelloTruzzi’s arm’s-lengthtreatment. Moody, however, began with the same “academic detachment”:In 1965 while carrying out other research in San Francisco, California, I heardrumors of a Satanic cultwhich planned to give an All-Hallows Eve blessing to a local chamber of horrors.I made contact with thegroup through its founder and high priest and thus began over two years ofparticipant-observation as amember of a contemporary black magic group. As a member of this group Iinteracted with my fellowmembers in both ritual and secular settings. The following description is basedon the data gathered at thattime.As for Moody’s evaluation of the quality of individuals in the Church of Satan,it proved to be ratherless than Anton’s:Of the many characteristics that emerged from psychological tests, extensiveobservations, andinterviews, the most common trait, exhibited by nearly all Satanic novices, wasa high level of generalanxiety related to low self-esteem and a feeling of inadequacy. This syndromeappears to be related tointense interpersonal conflicts in the nuclear family during socialization.Eighty-five percent of the group,the administrative and magical hierarchy of the church, reported that theirchildhood homes were split byalcoholism, divorce, or some other serious problem. Their adult lives were inturn marked by admittedfailure in love, business, sexual, or social relationships. Before entering thegroup each member appeared tohave been battered by failure in one or more of the areas mentioned, rejected orisolated by a society274 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, July 19, VI/1971.275 LaVey, Anton, Introduction to Manual for Grotto Administration, JulyVI/1971.- 168 -frightened by his increasingly bizarre and unpredictable behavior, and forcedinto a continuing struggle tocomprehend or give meaning to his life situation. 276This from a man who had not only accepted the Satanic Priesthood but who, inOctober of 1973,would write a letter to Anton LaVey insisting: “I am closed-mouthed and theloyalest of your disciples.” 277I did not feel it my place to comment - we had just been through the trauma ofthe Northglenn incident -but I could and did voice certain differences in opinion in the interview Janet,Steve Foster, and I gave toHome Missions magazine, the official publication of the Southern BaptistConference, in September. Thearticle appeared in the magazine’s January 1972 issue and was entitled “TheDevil Made Me Do It”.Reporter Sandy Simmons was rather apprehensive as she drove up to 7403 YorktownRoad:Quite nervous, I rang the doorbell of the green, split-level house. The door wasopened by a beardedman dressed completely in black. At the top of the stairs was another man,dressed in black except for abrown plaid sports coat, holding the leash of a rather large, active Irishsetter. My first reaction was that thedog was going to jump at my throat. However the dog proved to be as friendly asher owners.Here I may pause to remember Brandy, the canine in question, for the many timesshe ruined whateversinister atmosphere I labored desperately to create, by overwhelming visitorswith her enthusiasm andfriendliness! [A side-effect of this is that she almost invariably received aparagraph to herself in most ofmy interviews.] Telling Brandy to quit capering about Simmons and go lie down,we three Satanists triedto recover some of the occasion’s dignity as the interview continued:“You understand that an organization like the Church of Satan has to be verycareful about the sort ofpeople we let in,” Aquino said. “If the local Grotto or the Central Grotto inSan Francisco, after examiningthis questionnaire, should have any doubt whatsoever of an individual’sintegrity or past record, then he ispromptly denied membership. Only reasonable, rational, law-abiding, responsiblepeople are admitted.”“You can’t convert a person to this kind of thing,” Stephen Foster said. “Yourecognize it as your ownphilosophy and then join. One of the strange things is that if I were to sitdown with anyone and discuss ourphilosophy, never mentioning the name of the organization, it would seemhumanistic, situation ethical,agnostic; the logic would be very apparent. Probably I would not provoke anyserious dissent.“But if I start out by saying I am a member of the Church of Satan and I’d liketo discuss our views,there’s an immediate reaction that often precludes productive discussion. Thereis a great deal ofmisconception. You might think we could make our lives a lot easier just byusing a different name, but ourphilosophy is a radical departure from any other organized - I hate to use theword ‘religion’ - philosophy. Itpresents a challenge to say that I’m a Satanist and then to go ahead andconvince you of the logical basis forthis.”“Such is the nature of the word ‘Satanism’ that it conjures up demons,” Aquinosaid. “The next thingyou know, the FBI is on our doorstep. The parents of one of our members - whowas over 21 - were sosuspicious of our ethics that they did call the FBI here in Louisville and askedfor information concerningboth the Nineveh Grotto and Anton LaVey. The FBI responded that there were noreports to the Grotto’sdiscredit, and that the only thing it knows about LaVey is that he walks aroundoccasionally in a fur coat.When I passed this remark on to him, the article in question was promptlyrechristened his ‘FBI coat’.”I have no idea whether Anton LaVey has willed that coat to the F.B.I.’s famousmuseum inWashington, D.C. Simmons’ next question focused on traditional notions of“devil-worship”:276 Moody, Edward J., “Urban Witches” in Spradley, James P. & McCurdy, David W.,Conformity and Conflict: Readings in CulturalAnthropology. Boston: Little, Brown & Co., VI/1971.277 Letter, James Moody to Anton LaVey, October VIII/1973.- 169 -“No Satanist or Black Magician will ever pray to Satan or any other Demons foranything at all. Satanrepresents the complete human ego; the other names represent aspects of theego,” said Aquino. “We arestruggling towards all aspects of the total human being.”“Satan, per our assumption, represents the ego of man as the godhead: manhimself as a divinity,”Foster said. “He is so powerful personally, both intellectually andmetaphysically, that he is in fact the godof his own decisions. Every Satanist in the Church has his own idea of who Satanis and what herepresents.”Some Satanists claim to have actually seen Satan materialize. “I have seenSatan, and so have othermembers,” said Aquino, an average-sized man with sharply pointed eyebrows. “Inthe subjectiveatmosphere of the ritual chamber this phenomenon will sometimes occur. But Idon’t think he willmaterialize right now over there by the stereo.”Although I tried not to look, my eyes shifted across the room to the stereo.Satan didn’t materialize.“It’s a psychological playing with the senses,” Janet said. “It’s notdrug-induced; it’s an actual image.There is a force within yourself. When you are able to free yourselfpsychologically, these things happen. Itis not anything supernatural or mysterious; it is just that when you disciplineyourself so that you are able torelease your inner forces, you enable them to manifest themselves in some formof abstract projection.”The Satanists say that they are not “out to get” anyone. They are just opposedto people - whetherChristians, Buddhists, Jews, or anything else - using religion as a crutch.“We are just a very minute part of a very large universe,” Aquino said. “Manjust happens to havecontrol of this planet. That isn’t because God gave him any capacity to raisehimself up, but rather becausehe raised himself up. Man fought very hard to evolve, but it’s as much chance asanything else that you andI are around today.“So once we take man the animal and give credit to man the animal for what manthe animal did, thenwe try to see what we can make of man - whether we can lift him above animalstatus and turn him into agod. This is what the Church of Satan eventually wants to do.”The Church of Satan has a lot of hecklers and curious spectators who half-smileat showman LaVey andhis secret passageways. But people can afford only to half-smile, becausemembers such as the Aquinos andFoster are serious. They are sincere in their beliefs; one cannot help butrespect that sincerity. They willcontinue to practice their philosophy of absolute freedom, wherein every man canbe a god if he chooses torecognize himself as one. 278When the magazine hit the stands in January 1972, we were pleasantly surprisedthat Simmons’treatment was as objective - even favorable - as it was. Even if she herself hadwritten a positive story, wehad assumed that the Southern Baptists’ editors would have retouched it to makeit toe the anti-Devil line.To their credit they did not. Anton LaVey commented to me:The piece by the young Baptist lady is one of the finest yet and speaks highlyof her integrity and theobjectivity of the magazine. Perhaps Home Missions is following the example setby the Christian ScienceMonitor. Above all else, though, the excellence of the article must be creditedto you and Janet fordemonstrating the proper magic with its authoress.Even if Home Missions printed the story out of pragmatism, it indicates adecrease in the generaltendency to maintain the Devil per se as an adversary. A new book which bringsthis trend into focus isRichard Woods’ The Occult Revolution (Herder & Herder, N.Y.). We alone may claimcredit for the growingobsolescence of Satan as a “bad guy”, if nothing else. In the Satanic Rituals Ihave tried to drive the pointhome that established religions are just going to have to find themselves a newscapegoat, for the Devil nowhas a voice in what has long been a one-sided game. You are quite accurate inyour admonitions againstpublic cross-trampling, though. Such antics, unless amply qualified, simplynourish the opponent’s existingconcepts of Satanism.The only time it is wise to act as Satanists are supposed to act is when youfind you have been disarmedby your own predictability (presumably atypical of Satanists), i.e. no longerable to confound your subject278 Simmons, Sandy, “The Devil Made Me Do It” in Home Missions #43-1. Atlanta,Georgia: Southern Baptist Conference, 1972.- 170 -because of excessive logic and super-rationalism. Even though there is no steelcapable of matching thedurability of our Diabolical Logic, it is sometimes necessary to resort to alittle Jesuit logic when dealingwith superstitious fools. 279While Home Missions was learning about Satanism in Kentucky, the U.S. MarineCorps was learningabout Satanism in North Carolina. On September 15 Warlock Dale Seago wrote tome:Yesterday I went before a promotion board, having served enough time in grade tobe eligible forpromotion to corporal. The board refused to recommend me for promotion. The coreof the matter was thatI am a Satanist. The board openly admitted that this was the main reason I wasnot being promoted. Theirreasoning was as follows:I work as a security guard in a confinement facility. Through leaks from otherduty personnel, theconfinees long ago became aware of my religious affiliation and are constantlyasking about it. I try todiscourage this by simply refusing to discuss the matter, but as the oldconfinees tell the new ones about me,the cycle continues. Thus the board concluded that my being a Satanist isdetrimental to my effectiveness ina rehabilitation program. I was told I could not expect to be promoted untilSatanism was proven to be nolonger an obstacle to the effective performance of my duty; i.e. “recant oryou’ll never advance”.They were also disturbed that I had been talking about Satanism to otherMarines, although I made itperfectly clear that I have never discussed it with anyone who did not first askme for information about it. Iwas cautioned against proselytizing and was told: “The Marine Corps is not arecruiting ground forSatanism. Take it underground.” When they asked how many Marines had everwitnessed the Satanic ritesthey had heard about from everyone (except myself), and I truthfully replied“none”, they said “keep it thatway”.I was also told that Satanism, differing as it does from other religions, is“eccentric”, and thateccentricity is an undesirable quality in a Marine noncommissioned officer. 280To Seago’s commanding officer went an appropriately courteous letter from me,crested with the blackBaphomet:Mr. Seago informs me that he was recently denied promotion and that the boardopenly stated that hisaffiliation with the Church of Satan was one of the reasons for this decision.I should greatly appreciate a statement from you on whether this was indeed thecase.The Church of Satan, for your information, enjoys legal recognition as anorganized religious bodyunder the laws of the United States. We feel very strongly about our reputationand ethical standards, andwe will not grant membership to persons whose integrity is open to the slightestdoubt. We have pursued -and won - several legal actions in defense of our name, practices, andmembership.Mr. Seago is extremely discouraged. He is exceedingly proud of being a Marine;we are also proud ofthis. Accordingly we sincerely hope that his pride in being a Satanist as wellconstitutes no barrier to hishonorable service in the United States Marine Corps. 281I passed this letter to a few fellow Army officers at Fort Knox before mailingit; there was a certainmalicious mirth in speculating how the Marines would react to such an“eccentric” jolt. How they reactedwas reported a few days later by Seago:The Station Corrections Officer made a great point of stressing the fact (?)that Satanism had nothing todo with my failure to be promoted. The objection seems to be not my affiliationwith Satanism, but ratherthe effect that knowledge of this affiliation has upon the confinees and otherMarines. It has given rise to all279 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 27, VII/1972.280 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, September 15, VI/1971.281 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Commander, MCAS, Cherry Point, North Carolina,September 20, VI/1971.- 171 -kinds of wild tales. I have heard stories, from people I didn’t even know, thatthere is a “devil worshipper”on base who conducts wild orgies and bloody animal sacrifices. I have even hearda perfectly seriousaccount of my turning a man into a frog.The Corrections Officer also stated that my writing to an outside organizationin this case was anindication of a lack of loyalty to my unit and to him personally.282It seemed that we had gone as far as we could under the circumstances. TheMarines were prepared toswear that they were not abusing Seago’s First Amendment rights, and neither henor the Church of Satanhad the legal resources to make more of an issue of it in that case. To him Iwrote:No government agency will ever admit to the practice or policy of any prejudiceexpressly prohibitedby the Constitution. But I think your superiors are now aware that any acts ofunfairness against you willnot go unnoticed by us. As the Satanic Bible indicates, we are not disposed toturning the other cheek, andwe are quite capable of contacting the Secretary of the Navy should thesituation demand it. 283The truth will out, however, and even in the closed-ranked Marine Corps thereproved to be one officerwhose sense of justice was strong, and Dale Seago was ultimately promoted toCorporal on February 12,1972. On October 13, 1971 Seago wrote:My squadron executive officer believes that prejudice did play a part in myfailure to be promoted, buthe recognizes that it would be exceedingly difficult to prove. Regarding myhaving been ordered not toperform any rituals on base, he said that I could win if I pushed the matter,but that in the long run I mightlose more than I gained. I told him that I had constructed an earthen altar inthe woods, within walkingdistance of my barracks, where I could perform my rituals without hindrance. Hecounseled me to continueto say “yes, sir!” to my C.O.’s order and quietly continue to use my secretplace.Autumn is coming on apace, and it is growing rather cold for rituals in thewoods. I think, however, Imay have found a way to circumvent the problem. I am a fairly competenthypnotist, having worked withthe technique for about six years. A few days ago I taped a ritual for anindrawing and concentration ofmagical force; the interesting thing is that the ritual is “performed” in thehypnotic state with no physicalmovement whatever. The tape hypnotizes the user, takes him in imagination alonga strange sort of angle toa doorless, windowless black temple wherein the ritual is performed and varioussymbolic phenomenaresult.The tape utilizes a combination of Satanic ritual procedure, imagery, magicaland emotion-linkedsymbolism, and constructive hypnotic suggestion to achieve a very interestingeffect; yet it is withal quitesimple. At the end of the ritual, the user is drawn back and then awakened.The drawback to this particular tape is, of course, that the experiences of theuser are purely subjective;but then, the ritual was meant to be that way. It provides an ego boost. Whetherit also achieves its primeobjective of actually bridging the gap between the conscious and subconsciousminds to provide a flow ofusable force is something I have yet to test. The next step will be to use thesame general methods in anattempt to manipulate external reality, for example a curse. I have no ideawhether it will work, and it wouldnever be as satisfying to me as performing a ritual in the flesh, but I findsome of the concepts involvedfascinating. 284Back in May of 1971 Wayne West and I had begun to draft plans for a FirstEastern Regional Conclaveof the Church, to be held in Cincinnati, Ohio over the Halloween weekend. Overthe ensuing months weexchanged plans and programs and negotiated the necessary arrangements with theConvention282 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, October 6, VI/1971.283 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, October 12, VI/1971.284 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, October 18, VI/1971.- 172 -Coordinator of the Sheraton-Gibson Hotel, one of Cincinnati’s finest facilities.With West’s departure, ofcourse, the whole project had to be abandoned.Or did it? On October 11th Janet and I drove north to Centerville, the suburb ofDayton, Ohio whereJohn DeHaven’s Stygian Grotto was located. The LaVeys had asked me to report onthe effects, if any, ofthe West catastrophe on Stygian and Belphegor (the Detroit-suburb Grotto headedby Warlock DouglasRobbins). As we walked through the front door of DeHaven’s apartment, the entireStygian membershipdropped to their knees, and DeHaven himself kissed my hand! Such, it developed,had been the customaryreception for a Priest under Wayne West’s jurisdiction. We sat down with thegroup and brought them up-to-date on the Church’s actual philosophies and policies.Upon returning to Louisville I wrote to Anton:As you can probably imagine, Stygian is presently in the throes of culture-shockas a consequence ofour recent visit. I left my file set of Blacklists with John DeHaven, and he hasnow discovered that there is agood deal more to the Church of Satan than reciting Wayne West’s master ritualevery Friday night. I willbring him the rest of the way into the First Century this weekend, when he willcome down to stay with usand participate in a Nineveh/Central-style ritual.I am taking care not to leave John with the feeling that he has been “doing itall wrong” for the pastyear. It is important that he realize that we are not just an upside-downversion of the Catholics, and that heshould also feel free to design such rituals as best suit the needs and desiresof his membership. Myapproach has been to make no comment one way or the other to the general Stygianmembership. The ideais for John to be “illuminated” privately, whereupon he can take further actionwithin his Grotto. Thechanges, if any, will then come from John, not me - thus preserving his positionof authority and dignity.I haven’t had the opportunity to check out Belphegor, but I expect the situationis more or less the samethere. I have asked John to circulate the Blacklist file through Doug Robbins,and the two of them havebeen in close communication since this past weekend.According to John DeHaven, the Stygian membership seems to have gone wild overour visit. The poorpeople were literally afraid to ask us any questions to begin with, and it tookJan and me the better part ofthe evening to draw them out of their shells. Once I convinced them that Ireally wouldn’t eat them alive forasking about the outside world [they apparently thought that Satanic Priests arecharacterized by such anattitude], they practically fell over themselves with ideas, opinions, andquestions. We were there until 3A.M., but we could have stayed until 7 or 8 on the basis of the evidententhusiasm.A curse ritual was scheduled. The ritual chamber is about the size of the PurpleRoom, and 25 candles(including strobes), 2 flame pots, and 4 or 5 incense burners were running fullblast throughout the 2-1/2hour ceremony. The door and windows were shut to preserve the atmosphere. Saidatmosphere waspreserved, all right; I don’t know about the gentleman being cursed, but inanother 5 minutes the entireGrotto would have been hospitalized for gas poisoning. I exercised my Priestlyprerogative and ordered thedoor opened … The Trials and Tribulations of Satanism!285There had been another discovery that weekend. The morning after the ritual,John DeHaven came byour Holiday Inn for a chat. During the course of the conversation he offered toshoplift any officeequipment the Church might need. In answer to my question, he assured me thatsuch methods had beenknown and approved by Wayne West. I told John that he had been badly deceived,and that he shouldimmediately return all such items on hand to their owners or to the police. Heagreed to comply, and theproblem seemed solved. West, I thought grimly, had been ousted not too soon.286John DeHaven offered to host the First Eastern Conclave at Centerville’sImperial House South, andwe contacted as many regional members as we could to alert them to the event.Janet and I had beenunable to travel to Belphegor in person, so we had hopes that we would be ableto meet the Grotto at theConclave. This was not to be, however, as Diane LaVey wrote:285 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, October 13, VI/1971.286 See Chapter #17.- 173 -Tom Swegles spoke with Doug Robbins last evening, and Doug told him that none ofthe members ofthe Belphegor Grotto would be able to attend the banquet because of financialdifficulties. Pity, as it wouldhave, as you pointed out, given them an opportunity to interchange ideas,transfuse one another with newvitality, and leave with a sense of accomplishment after not having allowedWayne West to continue to ruletheir psyches. [We are aware of this possibility and will just have to wait andsee what happens. As thesaying goes, slavery is freedom to some … but it sure ain’t Satanism!]And Diane had some nice words to say about the atmosphere at 6114 as well:In the last week or so I’ve seen a new vitality come over Anton; he’s working onso many things I can’tkeep up with him. For this I thank you and Jan. I am deeply grateful to you fortaking a great many worriesand the monthly newsletter responsibility off our shoulders.He sleeps for an hour or two, jumps up, dresses, and runs out to track down somematerials for whathe’s working on, then grabs a sandwich and disappears through the floor(trapdoor to his office) andemerges several hours later with something he’s created (written or otherwise).Honestly I can’t rememberhow long it’s been since he’s been this enthusiastic about what he’s working on.He works until hepractically drops from fatigue, then sleeps for only a few short hours andawakes completely refreshed andready to begin again.I am extremely pleased. Just thought you might like to know what an inspirationyou two have been tohim - and me too. 287And so, on the Halloween weekend, thirty Satanists from the midwest and southgathered for the firstof what would become a cherished tradition in the Church. Even though theprogram wasn’t as lavish asWayne West and I had originally envisioned, it was still exhilarating to seeelements of the Churchassemble for the first time, so far from San Francisco. At the banquet I read aproclamation of greetingfrom Anton LaVey, who received, in absentia, a standing ovation. In honor oftraditional Halloween I hadcomposed a special ritual, “The Celebration of Death” (Appendix #49, consistingof about two parts’M.A.A. Satanic blood-and-thunder to one part of the Koran to one part of theancient Egyptian “Harper’sSong”. The Satanists found it all very enjoyable, and the neighbors wereappropriately terrified. After itwas all over, I wrote to Diane LaVey:Well, we did it - and it came off rather well, all things considered. About 30individuals finally made itto the Imperial House for the banquet, and several Louisville members werepresent for both the Friday andSaturday night rituals. There was enormous enthusiasm among the participantsthroughout the entireweekend, and practically everyone expressed the desire to schedule a sequel thiscoming Walpurgis.At the last minute Michael Grumboski arrived from Belphegor. I spent a good partof Saturday morninggrilling him about the climate in the north and questioning him about theattitudes and actions of WayneWest. My conclusions are that Belphegor suffers from serious disillusionmentabout the organization - due,for the most part, to the financial exploitation the Detroit membership hassuffered. According toGrumboski the general attitude at this time is one of “wait and see”. I expectthat Grumboski’s reactions tothe conference - which were highly favorable - will have a strong effect uponthe immediate future ofBelphegor.Copies of John DeHaven’s Friday ritual and my Saturday one have been sent toyou. The strong anti-Christianity on Friday eve was a shock to Nineveh, and the rather strangemonologues of the followingnight surprised many Stygians … a meeting of two different frames of reference.The High Priest’sproclamation arrived in plenty of time, and I read it to the entire group at thebanquet. It was received mostenthusiastically and was discussed at length during the evening.The conference also allowed me to assess Grotto Leader John DeHaven. To Diane Icommented:287 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 27, VI/1971.- 174 -DeHaven has many strong points. He is polite, dignified, extremely serious aboutSatanism, and of aforthright appearance. He has a talent for ritual that is rare, and he hasStygian’s rituals refined to nearperfection in terms of execution. He has a steady job and a good communityreputation. He has evidentlybuilt up Stygian almost single-handedly, as it most probably would have foldedduring the recent crisis hadhe not guided it through. He oversees the Grotto very well; its administrative &financial affairs seem to bequite in hand.288Diane responded rather drily:On the subject of Belphegor suffering from serious disillusionment about theorganization: Theorganization (Central Grotto) is presently suffering from seriousdisillusionment about Belphegor! I’mbeginning to think the Master is right in his opinion that the whole Detroitmess could have been far lesstraumatic for all concerned, were the flames not fanned by the West/Robbinsbitch-fight.And I honestly don’t know where Doug Robbins stands now; we haven’t heard fromhim - not a singleword - since September 30th. For all we know, Doug might be a bishop in WayneWest’s new “church”.These fruits are ready to kill each other one minute, and the next minutethey’re jumping into bed witheach other. We’ve really had it with Satanic fairy godmothers - a newspecification in the requirements forthe Priesthood: Applicant must be straight!This, of course, isn’t going to be made public, but it will be an unwrittenregulation. All our liberalismwith regard to homosexuality has gotten us is a lot of headaches. 95% of allhomophiles are about as matureas teenyboppers. And do they ever love to dish the dirt. 289It must be recalled that, when the Church of Satan was begun, Anton LaVey hadmade a strongstatement welcoming persons of any sexual inclination, and he had been sincerein this. Presumablybecause of the problems involving Larry Green and Wayne West towards the latterpart of 1971, however,the LaVeys were becoming disillusioned about their open-mindedness in thisregard. Since equally-severeproblems sparked by heterosexuals had surfaced and would surface, however, it isprobably fair to say thatthe LaVeys’ 1971 position was based upon emotional irritation rather than ondeliberate reflection. I wroteback:I can’t give you a conclusive word on Belphegor yet. Robbins called me the otherevening to tell methat he was continuing to hold activities regularly, and that Wayne West’s40-strong “Universal Church ofMan, Inc.” was making it hard for him to keep his 6-12 members’ morale up. Hesounded optimistic in thelong run, however. 290Towards the end of 1971 the Church of Satan showed signs of expanding outside ofSan Francisco onthe west coast as well. In November the Karnak Grotto was chartered in SantaCruz, California under theleadership of a postal official, Warlock James Stowe, and his wife Dolores (aWitch). They proceeded topaint the interior of their house at 316 Dakota Avenue gloss black a la 6114,and on the lintels and door-frames they added many inscriptions in silver-colored Egyptian hieroglyphs,among them: “In the city ofSanta Cruz, during the reign of High Priest Anton Szandor LaVey, living emissaryof Satan, Lord of Hell,this Grotto named Karnak had its beginning.” - and - “Karnak Grotto shall forall time be dedicated toSatan, Lord of Hell, High Priest Anton Szandor LaVey, Lady Diane, and all themembers of the InfernalEmpire.”288 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, November 2, VI/1971.289 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 5, VI/1971.290 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, December 10, VI/1971.- 175 -A sub-unit of the Grotto called the Bubastis Chapel, was also established in SanJose by a Witchnamed Margaret A. Wendall. On December 5th I received my first copy of theKarnak newsletter, Satan’sTurn. 291In November I was contacted by a Louisville motion picture company. Until now ithad producedbusiness commercials and training films, but it felt called by bigger and betterthings - such as a monstermovie! The presence of a local Church of Satan seemed, accordingly, to be a goodthing. Nineveh talked itover, decided that it would be fun, and agreed to help. I wrote up the resultfor the February 1972 ClovenHoof:Meanwhile, Back in the Ritual ChamberThe Church of Satan recently completed technical assistance to the production ofa new film entitledThe Satan Spectrum. Last fall we were contacted by Louisville’s Studio OneProductions; they had decidedto make a horror movie, and they wanted to outdo The Brotherhood of Satan. TheChurch of Satan wasinvited to review the setting and script of the ritual sequence and to coach theactor-Satanists and the demonin their behavior.Synopsis: A sweet young concert pianist suffers a breakdown due to overwork. Sheis sent to recuperateat the rest-home of one Dr. Specter. While she is at the mansion, an assortmentof other young ladies aredispatched by a series of more-or-less repulsive accidents. One is eaten aliveby snakes in a swimming pool,another is completely dismembered, etc.Eventually the pianist finds herself bound to a sacrificial altar surrounded byan assembly of Satanistsand Dr. Specter, who intends to sacrifice her to Abaddon. When the latterappears, however, he discoversthat the pianist is not a virgin and turns upon Specter in a rage. Thisoversight is serious enough forAbaddon to fry his erring Priest to a crisp, whereupon the handsome hero and thecops break down the door,rescue the girl, and bust the Satanists.The hero takes his love out to his car to drive her home - whereupon he issecretly possessed byAbaddon … and the beast and his unsuspecting beauty drive off into the sunset!The specially-designed suit that Dr. LaVey wore as Satan in Rosemary’s Baby wasflown in from LosAngeles for Abaddon’s use [with a new head]. That suit, by the way, covers thewhole body with latex,neoprene, and leather. It is so heavy that “Abaddon” fell flat on his face thefirst time he tried to walk in it.Props for the ritual chamber and Dr. Specter’s ceremonial robes were provided bythe Nineveh Grotto. 292“Abaddon’s” suit, easily identifiable from its earlier appearance in Rosemary’sBaby, was actuallyworn by a woman because it was too small and tight for a man. [Its exterior wasdesigned to be adult-malesize.] We thus concluded that Anton LaVey could not have worn it in Rosemary’sBaby and thus did notplay the role of the Devil in that film.I had high hopes for The Satan Spectrum, which incorporated the first Satanicritual sequencecompletely written by a Satanic Priest (myself). [For a sample of the impact,compare Appendix #50 (anextract of Studio One’s original script) with Appendix #51 (my revision).]When we finally viewed the finished film, however, it was apparent that thenon-ritual scenes weresomewhat lacking in atmosphere. The hero, upon snooping around the asylum’sgreenhouse (?), comesupon a severed head. He takes it to the local police chief, places it on hisdesk, and says belligerently,“See, I told you something strange was going on out at Specter’s place!” Withoutso much as a blink, thechief responds, “Yes, I guess you’re right.” Turning to a lone file cabinetright behind his desk, he pulls afile out of the top drawer: “Specter, hmm, yes - looks like we got him for devilworship about ten yearsago …”291 Karnak Grotto, Satan’s Turn #I-1, November VI/1971.292 Aquino, M.A. in Cloven Hoof, February VII/1972."},{"pageContent":"- 176 -The Satan Spectrum never made an appearance in movie theaters to my knowledge,but over a decadelater it finally surfaced - renamed Asylum of Satan - as a commercialvideocassette tape. 293 Those with thecourage to view it may take note of Huntley & Brinkley, my two bronzecandleholder-dæmons, atop thealtar, the Baphomet emblem behind same which bears a curious resemblance to anIrish setter [Brandywas my model, as I had no goat from which to draw], and my III° Baphometmedallion hanging from thesoon-to-be-charred neck of the insidious Dr. Specter! Following the filming, J.Patrick Kelly, Studio One’svice president and director of the film wrote to me:I wish to take this opportunity to express to you, on behalf of Studio OneProductions, Inc., Studio OneAssociates, and the cast and crew of the movie The Satan Spectrum, our sincereappreciation for the favorsand technical advice extended to us by the Church of Satan and yourself.We feel that the altar decorations and the proper seals and evocations which youwere kind enough toprovide did much to ensure a convincing story. Be assured the Church willreceive acknowledgment in ourfilm credits. Please accept my personal thanks for your valuable assistance. 294In San Francisco, worn down by never-ending death threats, vandalism, andharassment by belligerenttourists, the LaVeys had finally erected a strong steel fence topped with barbedwire in front of 6114California Street. Even so they were called to court to explain why the barbedwire was needed; it wasapparently contrary to some local ordinance. The court was impressed with theaccounts it heard, and thebarbed wire was allowed to remain. But even so it was a rare month when theLaVeys did not have to dealwith missiles or cans of paint thrown over the fence, smashed car windows, oreven rifle shots taken at thehouse.6114 maintained its famous black facade until after the events of 1975, whenAnton made the decisionto paint it beige [which it remained, horribly, until 1986 when it was once morerepainted a distinguishedSatanic grey & black]. The fence and barbed wire remained, testifying tocontinued vandalism despite thecamouflage - or perhaps, more sadly, to the toll of the years upon the nerves ofthe residents.In late 1971 Anton LaVey was hard at work on the manuscript for the SatanicRituals [see Chapter#22], his projected companion volume to the Satanic Bible. He wished to includea ritual based upon theCthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft. Since HPL authored no detailed texts of the“nameless rites” hereferred to in his stories, Anton asked me to create one.I plunged into various tomes on loan from the Miskatonic University in Arkham,Massachusetts, cross-referenced the results with my own archæological and thaumaturgical library, andsent “The Ceremony ofthe Nine Angles” [in English only] to San Francisco.On the evening of the South Solstice VI, Anton telephoned me to discuss theritual. It had caught himsomewhat by surprise, because he had anticipated a “Cthulhu/sea-oriented” ritualrather than a “Satanic/fire-oriented” one. He wanted to include the “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” inthe Satanic Rituals, but healso requested a “Cthulhu” text as well - and an introduction explaining thecomplex considerationsinvolved in the two texts. We talked long into the evening, and on December 22 Iformalized my thoughtsto him:In accordance with our telephone conversation of last evening, I will proceed toredraft the introductionto the “Lovecraft” ritual. The new version will be nonfictional, stressing thepsychology's of the CthulhuMythos and Lovecraft’s evident compulsion to attack the essential mystery ofhuman existence through hiscreatures’ personalities. In addition I will revise certain inconsistencies inthe Shub-Niggurath ritual andcompose a Cthulhu-based ceremony to accompany it. Because of General Patton’ssuspense date for thecavalry data on which I am working, I will probably not be able to mail thefinished texts of the rituals to293 Asylum of Satan is available as a DVD from “Something Weird Video”#ID1598SWDVD. There is a website devoted to Girdler’s films,including Asylum of Satan, at http://www.williamgirdler.com[http://www.williamgirdler.com]294 Letter, J. Patrick Kelly to M.A. Aquino, December 3, VI/1971.- 177 -you until the first week in January. I hope that this delay will not strain theschedule of the new book’sproduction, but I do feel that the results will be well worth the added time andeffort.On the telephone I voiced the opinion that the affairs of the Church often seemto guide themselvesindependent of the personalities involved. This now seems to be one of thoseinstances. A single ritual thatemphasized only one aspect of the Lovecraftian theories would be incomplete byitself, as it would notserve to cover the philosophy of duality that the author was able to portray -and that Derleth, I think,completely overlooked. I suppose that this is as good a time as any to explainmyself:As you know, I have been devoting a good deal of my spare moments to Egyptology.I don’t considermyself an Egyptomaniac after the Rosicrucian model, but the fact remains thatthe ancient Khemitecivilization endured for 4,000 years - about 2/3 the duration of civilizedhumanity. When one considers thatthe Romans lasted for only a single millennium, and that the United States hasbeen around for 200 years,this figure assumes significance.Furthermore it is evident that the extraordinary cohesion of the Nilecivilization can be attributedlargely to the precision of its religious mythologies. Again and again I havefound a firm correlation to existbetween the dominant god-cycle of the moment and the fortunes of the empire as awhole. The bases of thisare not supernatural but psychological.Normally, when considering Egyptian history, one thinks of the Osirian cycle asthe supreme theologyof the civilization. Even such distinguished archaeologists as Budge aredisposed to reinforce this idea. Infact, however, the Osirian cult was a relatively late development in Egypt,assuming dominance only duringthe final decadence. It was a cancerous philosophy completely alien to thedoctrines that had forged theempire, and, as was noted in Blacklist #11 [Note: “Concerning the Black Order” -earliest version of thearticle I eventually rewrote for Cloven Hoof November/December 1972 as “TheSource” - M.A.], it servedas the forerunner of the world’s various death-oriented beliefs - including theJudaic/Christian tradition.Until the advent of the Osiris cult (at roughly the XXII Dynasty), the Egyptians- both priests andpopulace - were oriented towards an extremely complex religion of life. By“complex” I mean that thephilosophy was far more sophisticated than mere fertility glorification.Furthermore it incorporated a systemof duality far more crucial to the human personality than the usual, cruderepresentations of the dualprinciple (yang/yin, male/female, light/dark, life/death, etc.).Religious emphases in Egypt were city-oriented. While the recognized pantheonwas national in scope,certain gods rose to authority during the dominance of their respectivepatron-cities. During the earliest eras- the so-called “Old Kingdom” - Ptah of Memphis was the most influential deity.During the “MiddleKingdom” period Ptah gradually gave way to Ra of Heliopolis, from whom thePharaohs of the timeclaimed descent. The extremism of Akhenaten, whose solar-infatuation brought theXVIII Dynasty to anend amidst revolution and invasion, discredited pure Sun-worship. The next threedynasties incorporatewhat I loosely term the “Satanic” era of Egyptian civilization.From the seizing of the crown by the general Horemheb to the death of RamesesIII, the dominant cultof the country was that of Amon, the ram-god of Thebes. This is the “New Empire”period, when Egyptrose to her greatest stature and extended her realm to include the entire knownworld. Amon, like theprincipal deities before him, enjoyed a firm compatibility with Set, and thesetwo figures were to forge thealmost perfect metaphysical duality. The solar aspect was eventuallyincorporated as well - when Amonassumed the name of Amon-Ra.Upon the death of Rameses III and the institution of the XXII Dynasty, Egyptentered a period ofalmost catastrophic decline. She was invaded repeatedly, and the “Pharaohs” fromthen on were of foreignblood. The Nile became a land of misery, taxation, and exploitation; and thelife-after-death cult of Osirisgradually gained prominence. The power of the Priesthood of Amon at Thebes wassufficient to prevent thetotal eclipse of the ram-god, but the Priesthood of Set was persecuted andalmost totally destroyed. A merevestige survived at Mendes in the Nile delta, where Set-heh was honored underthe most secretiveconditions.The Osirians reduced the elder principle of duality to an almost patheticcrudeness: that of Osiris/Isis =male/female and Osiris/Set = good/evil. The old Horus was recast as Osiris’ son- the “redeemer” ofhumanity - and Anubis, previously the symbol of the dark arts of metaphysics (incontrast to Thoth, whowas decidedly more benevolent) was pressed into service as the patron ofembalming and the guide of dead- 178 -souls. The purge of the doctrines of Set was the most thorough in Egyptianhistory; for all intents andpurposes he now remained only as the vain and petty enemy of Osiris and Horus.So much for the course of Egyptian mythology. I expect that you are familiarwith most, if not all ofthis, so I won’t belabor it further. I bring it up only because of its relevanceto Lovecraft. He seems to be theonly theorist of a fantastic disposition who was able to break away from thecorrupted, Osirian-basedduality and portray something of the original Amon/Set philosophy.The Amon/Set relationship was only partially preserved by the old forms ofSatanism. Ironically the“Satan” whose name derives from the god of Mendes is normally cast in the moldof the Theban ram-deity.It was not until you introduced the peculiar relationship between Satan andLeviathan that the ancientduality could be completely reformulated. It has taken me some time to realizethis, but as I mentioned in anearlier letter, it is increasingly self-evident. It also explains a good dealabout the ultimate nature of theChurch of Satan and the Order of the Trapezoid.In Lovecraft the principle is illustrated but never formulated. I doubt thatLovecraft was able tovisualize the ultimate implications of his mythos; i.e. he “couldn’t see theforest for the trees”. This wouldexplain his evident frustration with the material he did produce. Perhaps he wasaware that his storiescontained a theme greater than that of the normal horror story, but for somereason he was either unwillingor unable to elaborate upon it. I also suspect that his awareness died with him,as the comparatively shallowwork of Derleth et al. is only an exploitation of the horror-inspiringtechniques devised by Lovecraft.The formula that Lovecraft caught in the Shub-Niggurath/ Nyarlathotep/Cthulhurelationship - and thatthe Church reintroduces in the Satan/Lucifer/Leviathan terminology - is onlypartially covered in the “NineAngles” ritual. A Cthulhu complement is thus essential if the importance ofLovecraft is to be accuratelyrepresented. Furthermore there are certain aspects of the present ritual thatprobably ought to bereconsidered once the basic theme of the Cthulhu text has been worked out.One important consideration, of course, is the degree to which all this isspelled out in the introduction.It isn’t the sort of thing that would be comprehensible to most people,obviously. I would welcome anyobservations that you might have in light of this.You have often said that the true sorcerer must be the judge of his mastery ofthe Black Art … that forhim to shift this responsibility to another is, in effect, a demonstration of alack of confidence in himself anda placing of the evaluation upon those who need not pay the penalties oferroneous self-estimation. I believethis to mean that, while you exercise the authority of confirmation, allaspirants to the level of magical skillepitomized by the IV° must first affirm a belief to that effect. To state thisas a “requirement”, of course,would be to defeat the entire concept of the IV°.To the best of my estimation, and after the most careful consideration of theconsequent implications, Ibelieve that I am prepared to assume the responsibilities of the IV°.I shall say nothing more henceforth, pending your decision.295No sooner had I mailed this letter than I received one from Anton LaVey - datedthe day after mine andcomposed, certainly, before it could have reached him:It gives me great pleasure to appoint to the IV° two of my most valuedassociates, yourself andReverend Steenbarger. Congratulations.You have proven your pastoral, organizational, and administrative abilitiesunder conditions which haveoften been less than tranquil and at times downright exasperating. This ofcourse requires a special kind ofstability and coordination not acquired through any formal institute oflearning. More than ever before, thePriest of Satan must exhibit these qualities; yet no test - save pastachievements - can allude to one’spotential.I am sure you have learned much in the time you have spent within the Priesthoodof Mendes -specifically, revelations concerning facets of human behavior that even yourpast experience had notuncovered. As for myself, I thought that I knew a great deal about human foiblesuntil the last five years ofSatanic ecumenicity produced an entirely new spectrum of marginal behavior.295 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, December 22, VI/1971.[index-179_1.jpg]- 179 -More important even than patience and wisdom under trying situations is therequisite of the Sorcererof the Realm that allows him to speak and act directly from the Central Brain -the Controlling Frequency.Your thoughts are mine, as are your feelings, your goals, your source. You havedisplayed this more witheach successive communiqué, hence your appointment.Fortunately, despite Yeats’ premature pessimism, the best do not always lack allconviction. We areextracting a few gems whose convictions match their quality. The worst, however,are still filled with themost passionate intensity, and will always be, I fear.The Show is on the road now. It is up to the Sorcerers to beam the impulses fromtheir Towers. We havemuch to do.296With the letter came a personally-prepared certificate:296 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 23, VI/1971.- 180 -Again, to those who might question Anton LaVey’s personal conviction of hisauthenticity as HighPriest of the Prince of Darkness, I submit this evidence from his own hand, onthe occasion of one of themost solemn and sublime events in the initiatory process, the recognizing of aMaster.Four days later, after he had received my own letter, Anton sent a postscript:For the record, your registered letter of December 22 arrived in San Franciscobut did not reach myhands until today. Again, your thoughts are mine! This curious “coincidence” hasgreatly added to mypleasure in having recently recognized you, in formal manner, as a Sorcerer ofthe Realm. I am equallypleased to receive new evidence to support my conviction that you are indeed intune with the Frequency, aswitness your latest observations expressed in your letter of the 22nd. 297I resumed work on the essay and rituals for the Satanic Rituals. Shortly afterthe turn of the year I wasfinally ready to send them to San Francisco:Enclosed are the revised introduction concerning H.P. Lovecraft, the revised“Ceremony of the NineAngles”, and “The Call to Cthulhu”. After considerable thought on the matter, Idecided to include theYuggothic language in both rituals. Admittedly it adds to the difficulty ofperforming them, but I think theadded authenticity more than compensates for this. I intentionally omittedtheatrical touches whereverpossible, as the two rituals are designed to be more operative than illustrativein nature. I attempted tovisualize, so to speak, a “conversation” between the Old Ones and their humanfollowers.As for hidden references to the doctrines and traditions of the Church of Satan,the texts are jammedwith them! I did, however, remove or alter some of the original terms that weretoo obviously parodies uponconventional terms or concepts. 298On January 27 Anton wrote back:The Lovecraft rituals are perfect and are on their way to the publisher, havingbeen left completelyintact with the exception of a short section inserted towards the end of theintroduction, citing certainexamples of seaside Cthulhu-haunts and other imagery readily correspondent toLovecraftia. This alsoserves to inject enough of my own style into your text to blend the two. Isuppose, though, that somedaysomeone will be reading one of your treatises and exclaim to himself, “Thatreads just like parts of AntonLaVey’s book of Satanic rituals.” 299297 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 27, VI/1971.298 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, January 7, VII/1972.299 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 27, VII/1972.[index-181_1.jpg]- 181 -By now the reader will have been able to discern a number of divergent andsomewhat incompatibletrends within the philosophy and doctrine of the Church of Satan. Some of thesemight be summarized:1. Satan is a mere symbol in a wholly materialistic Universe.2. Satan is a sentient entity in a Universe which is far more complex than isdetectable via the“normal” human senses which we are accustomed/conditioned to use.1. Satanism is the glorification of, and indulgence in the animal pleasures ofbodily existence.2. Satanism is the assumption that mankind incorporates an element ofself-awareness and Willthat differentiates it from all other forms of life, and that the promise ofmankind’s future liesin strengthening this element.1. Satanism is anarchistic; therefore an organization of Satanists willultimately disintegrate.2. Satanism is so complex that no one individual can comprehend it. Acooperative environmentis necessary, and there is no reason for this environment to break down.Satanists should beabove petty human ego-trips and power politics.1. Grottos are essentially untrustworthy, and they must be subject to strongcentralized control.2. Grottos must be given the maximum of decentralized freedom. This willencourage them togreater maturity and responsibility.1. Satanism attracts the physically sensuous and self-indulgent.2. Satanism attracts philosophers and magicians who set the highest and mostdifficult standardsof excellence for themselves.In general the #1 assumptions governed the Church from years 1966/I to 1970/V,while the #2assumptions were predominant from 1971/VI to 1975/X. Since the #1 assumptionspostulate immatureand irresponsible behavior by members, an organizational posture designed toexpect and control thatbehavior would not be in for many rude shocks. The #2 assumptions, however,presuppose that allofficials and indeed most of the members are mature and responsible to a degreesignificantly higher thanthat of secular society. An organizational posture based upon these #2assumptions would encourage thegreatest individual development of members, true, but it would also subject theorganization to severeshocks if it were used by members or officials for corrupt purposes.Some critics of the Church of Satan are of the opinion that Anton LaVey foundedthe Church basedupon the #1 assumptions, that he only allowed the #2 assumptions to creep inbecause of my influence,- 182 -and that he wrenched the Church back to the original #1 assumptions in 1975after having his fill ofproblems resulting from the #2 atmosphere.As this documentary account will show, the truth is far more complex. Anton’sprinciples were high,not low. He wanted the Church to rise to heights of nobility and grandeur, notto be an organization of pigswallowing happily in the mud. He hoped to attract the best type of individualsas Priests and GrottoLeaders, and he anticipated great futures for the various Grottos.Finally he believed in himself - that he was truly what he said he was, andaccordingly that hisphilosophy and pronouncements represented a higher and more perfectUnderstanding and Utterance oftruth than would have been possible were he merely an ordinary human being withsome exotic ideas.And why did Anton LaVey regard me so highly as a student, friend, and ultimately“Devil-son”?300Not because I brought him something which he did not have, or because I wassomething which he wasnot, or because I did something for him which he could not do for himself.Rather it was because Iappeared to him as a harbinger of the ideal future of Satanism, both personallyand via the efforts I madeto encourage this same evolution in the Church as a whole. He wanted to see myinfluence on the Churchsucceed because he wanted to see the Church succeed, and he wanted to see theChurch succeed becausehe wanted to see Satanism succeed in its greatest sense.The Northglenn Incident and the breakup of the Babylon Grotto were the firstindications that the #2assumptions were in for rough sailing. Nevertheless the LaVeys and I did notthink that the battle was lost- just that it would take a bit longer to teach Rosemary’s Baby to stand on itsown feet. Hence ourwillingness to work with the coal that we mined. In the future, we were certain,it would be refined intodiamonds.The years 1972/VII - 1975/X saw an increasing tension between the #1 and #2assumptions. Thesophistication of the Church’s philosophy was growing by leaps and bounds, yetthe organizationcontinued to be jolted by crises of the most adolescent and petty sort. To saythat this was aggravating is adefinite understatement, all the more because cultivation of the #2 atmosphereand image was slow anddifficult and because #1 crises tended to cause disproportionate damage to thisdelicate structure.Meanwhile, of course, the LaVeys were contending with the prejudice and pressureof an outsideworld that thought them criminal at worst and amusingly eccentric at best -hardly an encouragement tothem to continue cleaning up after the temper tantrums of the Church of Satan.Nowhere is this betterillustrated than by their erection of a barbed-wire fence to protect 6114 fromvicious vandalism at thesame time that they were receiving accolades at the First Eastern Conclave fortheir principles, inspiration,and leadership.With the expulsion of Wayne West they - and I - thought that the poison was outof the wound. Wewere, as it developed, mistaken. What would become known as the “Stygian Crisis”began only a shorttime after that Conclave, which had been hosted by John DeHaven’s Stygian Grottoin Centerville, Ohio.In November I wrote to Anton LaVey:There has been quite a bit of input from Stygian in the last few days, and I ambeginning to have mixedfeelings both about the general quality of the Grotto and about John DeHaven’sskill in managing its affairs.One of his members has apparently been arrested in California for transporting ayoung lady across statelines; I am told that the member’s parents have decided to commit him to custodyif he returns to Ohio.Another member stole a motorcycle some months ago, and his probation officerappears to be nervousabout his attending Stygian functions. More than one Stygian member that I haveseen appear to be quitefamiliar with drugs, and - during a get-together at John’s apartment during theconference - the individual inthe next apartment inquired whether John would like some “dope” for the party,thus suggesting that Johnhimself is no stranger to the drug scene.John also confided to me last month that one of his members had acquired somevaluable equipment forthe Grotto through shoplifting. Wayne West, it seems, had sanctioned theft “ifyou can get away with it”. I300 See Chapter #24.- 183 -told him that it had better cease immediately, and that he should not retain anyitems acquired in thisfashion. He agreed, but now I note that he has suddenly received a newtypewriter and a mimeographmachine - both rather costly articles of equipment for the Grotto’s apparentresources. Until I have definiteinformation to the contrary, I assume that they were honest acquisitions, but Iam inclined to be a littlesuspicious. I hope I am wrong.As for the III° test for John: I do not think it would do any harm to let himtake it, if only to see how hedoes on it. Obviously he is not a Priest until you ordain him, test or no test,and he is so anxious to have achance at the examination that a flat refusal would be quite a blow to him. Ifhe should take the test and stillfail to attain the III°, then he will at least know that he was given thechance, and that he may apply laterwhen he has remedied any problem areas that may be indicated. And if he shouldpass the first test and meetthe other criteria to your satisfaction, so much the better. 301Simultaneously I wrote to John:Congratulations on the new typewriter and mimeograph machine. A mimeo is anextremely valuableasset to the administration of a Grotto. By the way, I trust that neither itemcame by way of your sticky-fingered constituent. As we discussed earlier, such merchandise may not beaccepted by an official or Grottoof the Church of Satan. 302No sooner had I posted these two letters than Suzanne McDonald, a member of theStygian Grotto,telephoned me in Louisville. The next morning I wrote to Anton:Asking that her call be kept in confidence, she related the following:John DeHaven is currently on parole for possession of drugs. In the past he soldLSD and other drugs tohigh school students in the area. He stored the drugs in his apartment, and thiswas the true reason for ByronDriskell’s departure. West knew of the situation but took no corrective action -and in fact condemnedDriskell. Practically every member of Stygian is a drug user, as is Johnhimself. Many individuals attendGrotto functions while under the influence of drugs. Finally she doubts stronglythat the new typewriter andmimeograph were legally obtained, since she doesn’t think that either John orthe Grotto possesses thenecessary financial resources.Per the enclosed letter I have acted to ascertain John’s version. I will relateany further data that come tolight. In the meantime I recommend that his consideration for the Priesthood besuspended pendingresolution of the above allegations. 303John admitted that he had arranged a sale of marijuana months earlier and hadbeen arrested for it. Hewas allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of possession (sic):All the members of Stygian Grotto have at one time or another tried drugs ofsome type or another.None of them to my knowledge are addicted or make constant use of narcotics.They are fully aware of thepolicies on drug use around grotto, and none have ever attended under theeffects, other that Mr. HarryBooth, on his first ritual. He was quickly advised of the matter, and has neverdone it again.The policy of Stygian Grotto is as follows. No person who is a member or guestof Stygian Grotto willbring with them or use any narcotic drug, including marijuana on or around thegrotto property, or in theparking lot, or in the area of the parking lot of the Country Villageapartments.301 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, November 23, VI/1971.302 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John DeHaven, November 23, VI/1971.303 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, November 24, VI/1971.- 184 -I do not use any illegal drugs or drug compounds, nor have I since the arrest. Ismoked one hit (drag)off a marijuana cigarette in Detroit at a Wayne West ritual in June. 304On December 1 I wrote to John:Thanks very much for the copy of your letter to Lana Green. If I were you, Iwould not worry undulyabout the effect the incidents in question will have upon the Council’sdeliberations. What’s done is done,and the Church of Satan is not minded to crucify adherents for past misdeeds. AsI mentioned to you overthe telephone, it is far more important that we be assured of the present andfuture capabilities of ourofficials.305And to Anton LaVey I wrote:Inasmuch as we have written record both of our position on drugs and of John’sexplicit denial thatillegal drugs are permitted at Stygian functions, I do not believe that Stygianis in a position to endanger thereputation of the entire Church. The Grotto appears to be functioning veryactively, and I am not inclined toread the riot act unless a problem of a serious nature should develop. I notethat he did not clarify whetheror not Stygian possesses any “hot” items, but I am going to wait for a few daysbefore forcing this issue. 306On December 5 Diane LaVey wrote to me:And now for Excedrin Headache #39 - John DeHaven! He’s probably basically a goodboy, but oh howI wish he’d tell the whole truth in the first place! I think we had better keepa close eye on him and theactivities of Stygian - and it would probably be best not to hide the fact thatwe are. If he’s made to toe theline under (at least suspected) surveillance, he’ll most likely get in the habitof doing things right. Then willbe time enough to relax our gaze. I really think he wants to do the right thing,but he doesn’t have muchresistance to temptation. We can’t, however, allow our entire membership topossibly suffer for the“mischievousness” of the Church’s “Peck’s Bad Boy”.We’ll send him the Priesthood test if you really think he understands theresponsibilities (on all levels)that the III° carries with it. I don’t think we can postpone publishing thearticle the Doctor has written onthe requirements for the Priesthood much longer, though. 307 He’s going to standvery firm on his decision toaccept only those applicants who he feels will offer something substantial - andlasting - to the Order, soI’m afraid there are going to be some rather disillusioned (hopefully notdisgruntled) aspirants.John sent us a tape of the ritual you wrote and he, Stephen Foster, JosephDaniels, and MichaelGrumboski conducted Halloween. 308 I must admit that each of them sounded very“priestly”. But there ismore to being a Satanic Priest than conducting impressive ceremonies, as youwell know! Insofar as John’sWayne West-inspired empire-building syndrome is concerned, we agree that it mustbe tempered; perhaps“redirected” would be a more apt term. We don’t find the idea of a Satanicsociety inconceivable as far asthe future is concerned, but conducting ourselves as if the time had alreadyarrived will only make us look -and feel - ridiculous.In regard to the DeHaven/Metcalf/McDonald/Driskell/West, etc., etc. situation,it’s pretty hard to knowwhom to believe, or what part of which story to believe. So I guess the bestthing to do is just keep siftingthe information that filters through to us from Stygian members and continue toquestion John on the pointsraised. It sure would knock our righteous-indignation routine [with the presswhen we’re questioned about304 Letter, John DeHaven to Lana Green, November 26, VI/1971.305 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John DeHaven, December 1, VI/1971.306 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, December 1, VI/1971.307 See Chapter #15.308 See Appendix #49.- 185 -criminal “Satanists”] into a cocked hat if bona fide members were caught in anyform of illicit activity. Butthen we can’t just break John’s spirit on the basis of hearsay either. He beganStygian under pretty difficultcircumstances and apparently has done his best to abide by your instructions.We’ll just have to wait andsee. 309On February 6, 1972 the waiting and seeing came to an abrupt end. MichaelGrumboski and TomHuddleston telephoned to report - in great detail - that DeHaven was once moredealing in stolenmerchandise.I called Anton, who instructed me to inactivate the Stygian charter, expel allmembers who were foundto be participating in the illegal activity, and do what else I could to correctthe situation. As a minimumhe stipulated the expulsion of DeHaven, Harry Booth, Ron Lanting, and GaryBorton - all of whom hadbeen identified by Grumboski and Huddleston as principals in the fencingoperation.Grumboski was charged with taking care of any “hot” items that might have foundtheir way intoGrotto members’ hands. In a February 8 letter to him I said:If the legal owner is not known, instruct the person to telephone theCenterville Police Department -anonymously, if he so desires - to request guidance on the correct method ofhandling the property. If youshould find a member who possesses such property knowingly and refuses to makesuch an honest effort toreturn it to its rightful owner, you are authorized to terminate that person’smembership and inform him thatthe Church of Satan will not attempt to excuse his conduct should the entireissue become a legal one.By direction of the High Priest I am informing the Centerville Police Departmentof John DeHaven’sremoval from office. I have no reason to believe that the department will actone way or another as aconsequence, but I want the situation set right in any case.310Simultaneously I sent the following letter to the Centerville Chief of Police:Due to the sometimes popular impression that the Church of Satan eitherencourages or toleratesviolation of the law, our executive council has established certain policies tomake our standards quite clearwhen necessary. One such policy is that, when the presiding officer of one ofour chartered local groups isdismissed from the Church for failure to adhere to our ethical guidelines, thelocal legal authorities shall beduly notified that he no longer is the authorized representative of the Church.As of this date Mr. John D. DeHaven of 9 Country Manor Lane, Centerville is nolonger an officer ormember of the Church of Satan. The Stygian Grotto, over which Mr. DeHavenpresided, is officiallydissolved as well. Our existing members in the Dayton-Centerville area are nowaffiliated only at-large withthe Central Grotto in San Francisco.The following passage from our Manual for Grotto Administration is quoted foryour information: “TheChurch of Satan is recognized as a legitimate religious body under the laws ofthe United States and theState of California. No member of the Church may consider his affiliation aslicense to transgress the lawsof his community, state, or nation. Violation of this guidance constitutesgrounds for summary terminationof membership.” 311To Anton I remarked:I really hate to send that police letter, as I am half-afraid they will decideto find out just why theChurch is disengaging itself from DeHaven. If they let things ride, so much thebetter, but I think we wouldbe asking for trouble to knowingly conceal an illegal situation. My letter putsus on record as acting toensure the integrity of our local groups, and it is up to the police to initiateany further action.309 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 5, VI/1971.310 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, February 8, VII/1972.311 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Chief, Centerville, Ohio Police Department, February8, VII/1972.- 186 -As for Grumboski, he is ill-fitted to be Horatio at the bridge, but he’s themost capable person we haveon the scene. If Janet or I should be called by any person concerned, we willsay that the decisions weremade by your office and that we are simply acting on your behalf. Consequentlyplease inform me if any ofthe included statements (expulsion letters, police letter, Stygian dissolutionannouncement) should beamended in any way. Further developments will be promptly communicated.312Complicating this entire situation was the fact that the Church of Satan was areligious institution, andthat it presumably had certain rights of confidentiality of members’ statementsand beliefs. The LaVeysand I were reluctant to allow a precedent to be set wherein secular societywould feel that it had a right tothe Church’s private information concerning its membership. Yet we could notcountenance criminal actsunder cover of the Church either.All that we could do, it seemed, was take steps to separate the Church from theindividuals in questionand then to handle any further developments as they might present themselves.Since Church policy hadbeen clear on the matter of legal conduct by the membership, we felt noparticular desire to try to shieldthose who had betrayed our trust. On February 11th I wrote to Anton:Last evening I received a telephone call from Michael Grumboski. He told me thathe had already madearrangements with the Centerville Police Department to drop off certain itemsthat he or other membersthought to be illegally acquired. Some of the items - including a small chordorgan that Huddleston believesto be the property of another local church - were to be returned last night -anonymously - to the PoliceDepartment’s office. Grumboski indicated that he is still contacting the variousmembers on this matter, andthat any “hot” items that turn up will be returned in a similar manner. So far,so good.He also mentioned that he thought some of DeHaven’s “five-finger discounts” hadmade it up toBelphegor. I needed to hear that! He is going to contact Douglas Robbins andinform him that any suchitems are to be returned or deposited with the local authorities. He could citeno evidence, so I cannot drawany definite conclusions as yet. But once the situation in Dayton is undercontrol, I expect to be having alittle chat with Mr. Robbins.Another bit of news: DeHaven’s escapades have turned sour on Borton and Booth.Yesterday -apparently prior to John’s receipt of his terminal letter - they both contactedShai (M.G.) and said theywanted nothing further to do with such activities. Grumboski asked my response.I told him that both ofthem were still out on their ears right now, but that, if they prove over timethat their spots have changed,we might consider letting them back in.Yet another item: DeHaven has approached the ladies of Stygian with a proposalthat they cooperate ina prostitution ring. I have instructed Shai to make it quite clear to the ladiesthat this is not one of theChurch of Satan’s authorized fund-raising methods.Grumboski is proving to be a better Horatio than I had expected to see him be.The fact that RonLanting is a 200-pound ex-Hell’s Angel who no doubt has used bicycle chains forother than propulsionbothers him not at all, even though he himself is, as I have noted before, asort of reincarnation of IchabodCrane. On the other hand, Crane did confront the Headless Horseman, so perhapsthe parallel is moreaccurate than I first suspected.I reminded him that the two most valuable clubs he had to wave - if necessary -were (a) the “interest”of the local police, and (b) the ire of Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey - both of whichJohn DeHaven fears to theextreme. I noted that, as long as DeHaven senses these two blades over his head,he is unlikely to causetrouble. Shai may feel as comfortable as Daniel in the lions’ den, but I wouldnot like to hear that he,Huddleston, or any others had met with foul play as a consequence of spillingthe beans.If the police ask me whether the Church suspects that John has done somethingillegal, I will send thema full report of everything I know on the matter, with copy to you and toGrumboski. Grumboski knows thathe and/or the other members may be contacted by the police at any time, and heis prepared to level withthem in such an eventuality.312 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, February 8, VII/1972.- 187 -Incidentally, Shai asked if it would be better for the Church if he were to beexpelled as well! Ianswered flatly that we don’t desert our loyal members in time of crisis, andthat I’d be the one to let himknow if we ever saw the need to kick him out. He sounded grateful - and almost alittle surprised. TheBabylon experience must not have left him with all that much confidence in theChurch’s integrity - andStygian doesn’t appear to have helped much either. 313Shortly after receiving his membership cancellation letter, John DeHaventelephoned “LanaGreen” (Diane LaVey). In a subsequent call to me, Diane indicated that she hadbeen entirely unimpressedwith his comments. I wrote to Anton:On Saturday morning I received a telephone call from Michael Grumboski. He hadbeen present whenJohn DeHaven made his call to Lana Green on the 11th, and he briefed me on thesubstance of John’smessage. He also told me of his own call to Lana a short time later. I am notcertain how much of thefollowing you may already know, so I will report it without abridgment:Grumboski noticed that, prior to DeHaven’s call, these items at minimum wereconspicuously absentfrom his apartment: one Gazette mimeograph machine, one electric typewriter, oneSony AM/FM stereoradio with phonograph deck, one Sony tape recorder, one Bell public addresssystem, one Bogan amplifier,two cassette tape recorders (Sony and General Electric), five ceremonial stoles,and two gold/silverchalices.Grumboski further stated that he had personal knowledge of a telephoto lens anda second typewriter ofwhich John had disposed in Florida. He brought up the lens in particular becausehe - Grumboski - hadpersonally sold it on John’s behalf. He said that, at the time, he had no reasonto suspect John’s legalownership of the expensive device.Joseph Daniels and Douglas Robbins have acquired mimeograph and Ditto machinesrespectivelythrough DeHaven. Grumboski has called them both and advised them of thepossibility that the items are“hot”. He does not think that either of them is knowingly involved in theoperation.Grumboski said that the two female members of the Grotto who had been approachedby John forprostitution were Anna Lee Estes and Janey Wolf. He did not have any furtherinformation on that matter.Everyone, of course, is burning up with curiosity over this “latest scandal”,and some sort of officialstatement is generally anticipated. Meanwhile the rumors are a-wing! Most seemto think that John got intotrouble on drugs, and it seems that John suspected this himself. At least, whenShai visited him on Fridaymorning, he was speculating on the possible causes for his expulsion. Henarrowed them down to two: (1)Central had learned that one of his acquaintances had been dealing dope in the“Witches’ World” head shop[run by John] a few days earlier, or (2) Central had discovered his continuedshoplifting.Shai tells me that John - very indignantly - called up a friend of his at thecounty sheriff’s office andasked him to come over and give his apartment a clean bill of health. The frienddeclined, telling John thathis word was sufficient. All this, coincidentally, took place after thatcollection of items listed above hadvanished. 314I sent an “official statement from John Kincaid” (Appendix #52) to all membersof the Church ofSatan in the Centerville/Dayton area, and wrote to Michael Grumboski:Of course there is going to be some conjecture on whether the statement is a“cover story” to obscuresome more insidious truth. Quite frankly this is not the case. We have heardenough stories from Centervilleto call in the F.B.I. ten times over, but everything boils down to the simplefact that the atmosphere in theGrotto is destructive and not harmonious. Cliques have formed, and those whohave been excluded fromthem have expressed fears concerning their future and reputation in the Church.313 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, February 11, VII/1972.314 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, February 14, VII/1972.- 188 -So - this is a cooling-off period for all concerned. We hope that all of ourmembers and ex-members inthe Dayton / Centerville area will finally benefit from the experience. 315Grumboski replied:Most (80%) of the members thought the paper on the Stygian problem was a coverstory. They feel thatthe Church is attempting to cover for the “group’s” petty crimes. [You werecorrect! Almost everyone knewwhat was going on!]It has come down the pipeline that John D. is starting his own church viz WayneWest. He says it willpractice Satanism in the true way (?).Enclosed find (a) list of stolen goods John requested Tom [Huddleston] to sell,and (b) payment receiptsfor “grotto fees” dated after the West paper was issued to the membership.I am sure that you have received all the truth, half-truth, and downright liesabout the DeHavensituation. I have heard all about John’s pushing drugs to pushing girls, sobeyond the aspect of the stolengoods I assume all else to be falsehood.From the tone and inflection of your voice during our last conversation, I knowthat the Stygiansituation has troubled you deeply. But I am sure, as the poets say - “Time healsall wounds.” Hopefully thatwill be the result here.316I replied to Grumboski in early March:I can well understand how the old Stygian members might feel that something is“missing” followingthe demise of the Grotto. In fact they will all receive the same attention andconcern that the Church accordsevery member-at-large, but nothing can quite compensate for the fellowship andmutual interest of a localGrotto situation. I shall recommend to Tom Huddleston, who seems to be thecentral figure on the sceneright now, that the members consider getting together on a regular basis. Itisn’t necessary that everygathering include a formal ritual either, as long as it is satisfying to allconcerned.I know that more than one member would like to see the Central Grotto “jump” onJohn, but in the longrun it would be demeaning to the dignity of the Church and ultimatelynonproductive. In taking the actionsthat we did, our first consideration was the effect that our handling of theepisode would have on themembers who live in that area.Janet and I were sorry to hear that it became necessary for you to move from theDayton area toMichigan. It seems as though you’ve been caught up in the midst of two - pardonthe expression - infernos -first Babylon and now Stygian. In each instance I’m certain it was a verypainful ordeal for you, and youmay wonder whether it is all worth it. For what it is worth, you have ourgratitude and that of the HighPriest as well. Any person can endorse Satanism when it brings him nothing but aglamorous andmysterious reputation in the community. It takes a different sort of dedicationto defend the innate integrityof the Church from those who would bend it to lesser ideals than those for whichit was founded. I know ofvery few individuals who could have stood their ground as you have done. 317From Indianapolis Joseph Daniels commented on the “official announcement” and onWayne West:Concerning the announcement, I must admit that I find the reasoning faultless.In fact it corresponds tosome views I have held for some time, insofar as I have seen the need todifferentiate between Satanism andthe Church of Satan. It was of critical importance for me to know that theactions taken against John et al.were not performed in a hostile spirit; therefore this explanation was greatlyappreciated.315 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, February 16, VII/1972.316 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, February 25, VII/1972.317 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, March 6, VII/1972.- 189 -It is possible that you have seriously misread my attitude towards Wayne West.It is not a question ofpreferring his methods to yours. Where we possibly do disagree is implied byyour questioning of my“judgment” in supposedly preferring his methodology. I can conceive of nocriterion on which one canestablish a basis for such a statement. Ritual form, whether anti-Christian oreven crude from the point ofview of a dilettante, is appropriate if it serves the needs of those employingthe form in question.Actually West’s methods were not really my cup of tea. I did, however, find thathis usages were abalancing factor in my tendency to be overly cerebral about magic and ritualpractice. Naturally I was notjudging his merit as a leader in the Church so much as appreciating him as aproponent of a particularviewpoint. I suppose that persons in the hierarchy of the Church cannot exercisesuch a broad tolerance. 318This was not the best of all times to talk to me about Wayne West. The Stygiansituation was still verymuch up in the air, and the LaVeys and I were hoping that the matrix of actionswe had set in motion todeal with it would ultimately work out well. To Daniels I replied, with perhapsa touch of rancor:Quite obviously the Stygian situation was not all sweetness and light. Uponbeing presented with anumber of not-so-pleasant facts on the matter, the Central Grotto and I wereforced into taking a moredrastic form of action than might otherwise have proven necessary. Had even oneof the Dayton/Centervillemembers informed me of the proceedings that were clearly in violation ofchartered Grotto ethics, we mighthave been able to save the Grotto and those four members as well. As it was, itwas necessary for me toresort to a formal working in order to ascertain the true facts.Summarily I am not at all pleased that such harsh action was finally required.You state that “it was ofcritical importance for you to know” the basis for the corrective actions takenby the Order. I can only wishthat the Order had been shown a similar courtesy by its adherents. You need notask me to explain myself indetail either.How, you say, can I question your judgment in preferring West’s methodology?Superficially it may bepossible to divorce ritual ethics from rational ethics. This, in fact, is theidea behind illustrative ceremonialmagic. As one proceeds deeper into the Art, however, it becomes clear thatritual behavior is in fact acaricature of the practitioner’s normal impulses. A verifiable relationship canbe established in eitherdirection concerning greater and lesser magic. In other words: As Wayne Westbehaves in the ritualchamber, so he behaves outside the ritual chamber. Only the social nicetiesreally change.One of the criteria for admission to the Black Order is that the applicant’spersonal desire for illustrativeritual must be sated. Henceforth he will be required to design and celebratesuch ceremonies on a strictlyobjective basis - with a view to the magical education of those members in hischarge. This is a seriousresponsibility, to say the very least.It eventually became glaringly evident to the Council of Nine that Wayne Westwas abusing thisresponsibility for his own entertainment. One of the cardinal rules governingrituals of the Church, forinstance, is that no participant should be pressured through circumstance into apersonally embarrassingexperience. Rituals in which members or applicants were suddenly forced or“invited” to disrobe fall intothis category, as do those wherein the Priest led members to make fools ofthemselves in an attemptedhonest response to his questioning. There are many other examples I couldprovide; I have heard more thanI care to remember from scores of the northern members.Whether certain members may have been masochistic is irrelevant. A Priest of theChurch of Satan hasno business exploiting members who have put their trust in his intellectualexpertise. They are in the Churchto learn the techniques for the application of greater and lesser magic - not tobe subjected to them. If this isnot evident to the general membership, then it certainly is to Initiates of theBlack Order. West knew quiteclearly what ethics he was expected to observe. It is because he violated them -and also because heattempted to mislead the Council concerning his true behavior - that he is nolonger with us. 319318 Letter, Joseph Daniels to M.A. Aquino, February 22, VII/1972.319 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Joseph Daniels, February 22, VII/1972.- 190 -In March Tom Huddleston wrote to offer the latest news from Ohio. It seemed thatthe last had notbeen heard from John DeHaven:I am sure that by now you have become quite tired of hearing about the mischiefthat goes on in Daytonwithout pause. I realize that any further conflict between Mr. DeHaven andChurch members during thispost-Stygian cooling-off period may appear to be a continuation of personalfeuds due to hurt pride andunsettled revenge, yet it seems that I am once more stirring up the coals. Sincemy pride remains intact andI have no personal desire for revenge at this time, this letter is my continuingattempt to preserve theintegrity and truth of the Church of Satan in the Dayton area. So much for myintentions.About a week ago I heard from a reasonably reliable source that John DeHaven hadstarted a newchurch called “The First Church of the Brotherhood of Satan”. It seems that Mr.DeHaven has declaredhimself High Priest of his church, with Ron Lanting as Bishop and Harry Booth asPriest of Information.This church holds weekly meetings and rituals, accepting all ages and types. Ihave been told that most ofthe members are young, and that some of them are under suspicion of drug trafficand criminal conduct.This church professes to be affiliated with the Church of Satan, and rumors arespreading that Dr. LaVeyand three people from Louisville are supposed to appear at one of its meetingswithin the next week orso. 320I responded [to Huddleston’s earlier phone call concerning the sameinformation]:John DeHaven’s claims that the group is authorized by the Church of Satan are,of course, quite untrue.Thus I doubt rather strongly that Dr. LaVey will fly to Dayton in the next twoweeks to present the charter!This sort of thing happens not infrequently in the environment of organizationswith rigorous standards.Those who cannot meet them elect to satisfy their craving for prestige via theestablishment of copycatgroups with themselves in ostentatious positions. They invariably succeed onlyin making themselvesobjects of ridicule.321And, by way of comment on his additional information, I wrote a few days later:Now let’s discuss what is to be done about John DeHaven and his new “church”.First of all I reaffirmto you that the existence of this group presents no danger whatsoever to theChurch of Satan. From aphilosophical standpoint his doctrine is trite and superficial. From a legalposition, as I have said, we are onrecord that he has nothing to do with the Church of Satan. If he were to gethimself into the worst possiblemess, it would not in any way reflect upon our registered members, either inthat area or elsewhere. 322Michael Grumboski, now back in Michigan, added his current assessment of thesituation:It is a very good thing that the Church does not recognize an anthropomorphicSatan, because, due tothe events of the past year and a half, I sure have felt as if a small fella inred flannel underdrawers with apitchfork has been pushing me around. Can you answer a question for me? Has thebalance factor ever usedanyone as an instrument for the welfare or the good of the group?All kidding aside, I fortunately or unfortunately have been placed in situationswhere problems andpressures existed. Luckily the results have usually been good. If I have been ofassistance to the Church, it’sbecause the Church has been of great assistance to me ever since I joined. Ithas shown me that my pastmorals were incorrect and has helped me adjust them to my liking. Don’t get mewrong; my morals todaywould put me in the general class of a prude by today’s liberalized standards.It has also helped in manyother ways, but to repeat them would be boring beyond belief.320 Letter, Tom Huddleston to M.A. Aquino, March 3, VII/1972.321 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Tom Huddleston, March 3, VII/1972.322 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Tom Huddleston, March 7, VII/1972.- 191 -I am sad to say that yesterday I talked to Mrs. McDonald and she informed me ofan increase in Mr.DeHaven’s cult. I also talked to Joe Daniels, who said that this was true andthat he was thinking of joiningtoo. Joe’s problem stems from the Council of Nine paper dealing with the Stygianproblem. He seems tothink the paper states that the official position of the Church is for allmembers to be the IBM 3-button,rubber-stamped junior exec type - that the Church, in effect, prohibits personalfreedom.It now seems that everyone but Mr. Huddleston, Miss Geske, Mrs. McDonald, Mr.Driskell, and Mrs.Metcalf are now enrolled in John’s school for the preservation of his ego. SueMcDonald is going to call allthe folks and see if they might like to stop by for a social party. She doesn’tgive up easily. Also John hasbeen passing little gifts to Karla Metcalf, so it looks as though she might dropout too. It seems that John isshowing letters and books of a damaging nature to the membership. It is beyondmy ken what he could havein his possession, but it seems to do the trick.The only really good news I have to mention is that in John’s wandering he hasincurred a good dose ofthe clap. I hope it gets serious and breaks out into complications, which, if Iam lucky, might damage hishearing - without which he couldn’t hear his own self-praise [a fate worse thandeath for him]. Forgive meif I seem a bit angry, but, darn it, there go a lot of basically good peopledown the drain. And it makes mesad to think that they could not see beyond John’s face into the truth. At leastwe have a fair start with thosewho are left. 323I replied:Actually you succeeded in answering your own question concerning the balancefactor. The situationswhich you have mastered during the past couple of years may have seemed undulytrying to you, but theresultant pressures on your judgment and behavior could not help but make youthat much more resourcefulan individual. When you get right down to it, true Satanism is in fact areligion of “pressure” and controlled“irritation”, not an organizational womb in the fashion of conventionaltheology. Our end is to strengthenthe various members, not to explain away their weaknesses by rationalizing them.Admittedly yourexperiences have been more - shall we say - stimulating than most. But I thinkthat the rewards will becommensurate.At this point we are totally unconcerned with John DeHaven’s group, as furtherattention paid to itwould only encourage him to continue and would only impede our own progress.Quite frankly, if we triedto stamp out every two-bit, pseudo-Satanic outfit that exists in just the UnitedStates, we would become soentangled in trivia that our own programs would slow down to zero. As for themembers and ex-memberswho are involved with John, forget about them. If they’re foolish enough todance to his tune, then theChurch of Satan is not interested in their fortunes. They were all advised thatthe Church withdrew itsapproval of John’s methods, and - from a Satanic point of view - the freedom ofchoice is theirs.I would be sorry to hear that Joseph Daniels is so disgruntled as to followsuit, but the same applies tohim. As a matter of fact, I have written him several letters on the subject ofCentral Grotto decisions withregard to Babylon and Stygian, so he has even less of an excuse than most to bemisguided. But both thedecision and the consequences will be his.As for Joe’s suspicion that the Church demands button-down collar members, suchan insinuation isreally too ridiculous to merit a serious reply. What we do insist upon is thatevery person who carries thatred card be an individual who is sufficiently mature to exercise good personaljudgment without our havingto give him or her any specific directives. This is an organization for adults,not children. If we encounterchildren in the organization - whether in Grottos or as members-at-large - wewill treat them appropriately.If Joe Daniels or anyone else insists that success be fed to him on a silverplatter, he will have to thinkagain. ’Nuff said. 324Tom Huddleston’s next letter, in early April, also suggested that the StygianCrisis was finally drawingto a close:323 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, March 12, VII/1972.324 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, March 30, VII/1972.- 192 -It seems that the information about the performance and personnel attending JohnDeHaven’s ritualssuddenly became completely hushed. Since mid-March there has been absolutely noword of John’s“church” activities. This could indicate that Wayne West has taken precedenceover the group and hasenforced the more sensible tactics of secrecy. At any rate the Dayton situationappears to be relatively calmand cooled-off at the present. The rumors directed against me have ceased, as ifby coincidence, since theapproximate time that I performed the ritual mentioned in my last letter.It has been brought to my attention that Mr. Bill Ingram still honors hismember-at-large status,although I have not been able to contact him to confirm this. According to SueMcDonald, he wishes toattend the Conference [East-2] at the end of this month. 325Bill Ingram, however, had contacted me. I can’t recall my exact emotions afterreading his April letter- which is probably just as well:I first became acquainted with the Church of Satan last summer by reading theSatanic Bible and seeingan advertisement in a hippie newspaper for the “Baphomet” head shop. There I metGrotto Leader G. ByronDriskell. Thinking the whole group might be as homosexual as Driskell is, I didnot join until JohnDeHaven took over. There were a number of girls around, and the picture lookedbetter. I later found outthat Driskell is all right and not pushy about his preferences.DeHaven led destruction rituals against Driskell and later Wayne West.Because of his bust on the pot rap, DeHaven emphasized no drugs in the Grotto.But some hippiesjoined and brought their drugs with them. They carried a myriad of tablets andcapsules in every shape, size,and color all in one bottle. Whenever anyone wanted to “do” something, he wentinto the bathroom, poppedthe pill in privacy, and then came back out.This drug problem started at 30 Country Manor Lane, where DeHaven also ran upsome tremendousbills in the name of the Church of Satan, Stygian Grotto. He then tried to passthese off on Grotto members,and it went over like a lead balloon. DeHaven got stuck with a large phone bill,at which point he movedrather than pay.DeHaven invited members of the press to the Grotto and rituals. Thisparticularly annoyed me, as I wastrying to remain anonymous. Back in ’64 and ’66 I ran for State Representativeon the Democratic ticket(unendorsed), and I plan on it again in the future. Can you imagine the midwestsuper-Christians voting forWilliam H. Ingram, Jr., the Satan-worshipper?DeHaven then moved to 9 Country Manor Lane, where Gary Borden passed out atritual. He went intochills and convulsions. DeHaven had to run out to get to a phone; he did nothave one due to the unpaid billat his previous address. The cops came with an ambulance. Borden tried to tellthe hospital officials that hehad pneumonia, but they insisted the attack was drug-related.I also joined a White witchcraft “Rainbow Coven” run by Mrs. Roberta Kennedy, aformer Church ofSatan member. She is repulsive in appearance and personal habits, a jack of allmetaphysics and master ofnone. Her rituals, if you can call them that, are a totally disorganized wasteof time. But two young girls hadjoined, so I stayed in. I told DeHaven about this, and he asked me to spy onthem and report to him. Therewas never much to tell. But what got me was that he told Kennedy what I was upto. I suppose this is howyou keep spies honest.Now enters Mike Grumboski. DeHaven has been having some internal problems andkicks somemembers out. He asks me to take the II° test and take some of the pressure offhim. I refuse because of mypolitical aspirations and DeHaven’s love of publicity at anyone’s expense.Grumboski moves in, bringing with him one Bruce, a homosexual who tries to pushhimself on everyguy who walks through the door. Grumboski is slated to start a new Grotto butcannot find employment andcontinues to stay at John’s apartment. DeHaven tries to keep Grumboski in theback of the bus, butGrumboski is capable of leading rituals and is not satisfied with this position.More members are kicked outand new ones taken in.325 Letter, Tom Huddleston to M.A. Aquino, April 9, VII/1972.- 193 -At this point DeHaven opens up the “Witches’ World” head shop and, right nextdoor, the “ArcadianWoods” teen-age recreation center. The parents are coming because the woods arefull of witches. DeHavenwants me to help finance all this, but I decline. Both businesses are doomed tofailure and last only abouttwo months.Since his forced departure from the Church of Satan, DeHaven has started his“First Church of SatanicBrotherhood” and is bad-mouthing Central Grotto. He has also renewed hisfriendship with Wayne Westand Mrs. Kennedy. On March 17 I attended my last meeting at DeHaven’s, adestruction ritual againstGrumboski, with West presiding. About 20 people were present from the Dayton,Detroit, and Louisvilleareas. Grumboski’s friend (?) Bruce was also there to help with thepin-sticking. When this was over, I toldDeHaven that these rituals were a waste of my Friday-night girl-chasing time,took off my robe, and leftwith no intentions of returning.I will stick with the Church of Satan. I have given you a true picture here tothe best of my knowledge. Iwas not able to attend all the rituals and am still in the dark on some items. Iwould like to see anotherGrotto in Dayton, but with all the recent trouble it would be slow going.P.S.: In several places I have made cutting remarks about homosexuals. This ismore with regard to theirpersonalities than their preferences. If there were 3 men and 3 women, and if 2of the guys were gay, then Iwould like to be the 3rd man and get all 3 of the girls. This is my outlook onthe question. 326The Babylon/Stygian debacle had savaged the Church of Satan in the midwest forsix months, andonly time would reveal how much additional damage it had done to theorganization. In some of the betterdays to come during 1973-4, I would conclude that the wound had finally healedand that the Church wasproceeding on its evolutionary path as forcefully and confidently as it had donebefore the 1971-72disasters in the midwest. Now I see that I was naïve and optimistic to theextreme. In Detroit and Daytonwere sown the seeds that would eventually bring the Church of Satan to itsultimate crisis.326 Letter, William Ingram to M.A. Aquino, April 2, VII/1972.- 194 -[index-195_1.jpg]- 195 -In March of VII/1972, while the last fires of the Stygian Crisis were beingbeaten out, Dale Seago’swoodland wanderings took him somewhat further afield, as he advised me:Last Friday (March 9) I undertook a little “psychic investigation”. There is aplace 10 miles west ofSiler City, N.C., some 200 miles from here, called the “Devil’s TrampingGround”. I read about the place inan article from a book on ghosts and mysterious occurrences in this state. Itconsists of a circular area in thewoods some 30 feet in diameter, around which is a path some 2 feet wide. Nothingwill grow on the path orwithin the circle; the soil, for some unknown reason, is completely sterile. TheDevil is reputed to appear inthe circle at midnight and pace around the path. What caught my interest was thearticle’s statement thatobjects placed on the path at night are never there in the morning. A friend andI decided to check it out.We drove to Siler City, informed the local news office of our intention to staythe night in themysterious circle - something the article stated had never been done - and droveout to the place and set upour camp for the night. Sat up until midnight smoking some excellent pipetobacco, then spread outsleeping bags on the path and turned in, not even bothering to keep watch.Whatever moved things off thepath would have to move us both, as well as 15” of good Colorado-forged Bowieknife in my right hand. [Igo along with Conan’s view regarding hypothetical “monsters”.]We slept well, if you don’t count cold feet, until 7:30 AM. We woke up - stillon the path - built up thefire, and had breakfast. Then we lay on our sleeping bags and relaxed in themorning sunlight with a coupleof good cigars before packing up and leaving.His Infernal Majesty apparently decided to take a rain check; we had a feelinghe would. As a “psychicexperience” the trip was a flop - but it was the most pleasant and relaxingcampout I’ve enjoyed in a longtime! 327This was not my first encounter with the “Devil’s Tramping Ground”. The site wasno mere tourist-trap; it was avoided with very real fear by the local residents, even in thelight of day. At midnight, it wassaid, Satan would appear to pace the circle, meditating on his memories of thepast and on his plans for thefuture. In 1969 Janet and I had performed a Satanic Mass on the site, so now Iwrote to Seago:Janet and I were very intrigued by the report of your visit to the “Devil’sTramping Ground”. In Marchof IV, when I was stationed at Fort Bragg, we also drove up there to inspect it- as a consequence, I suspect,of reading that same book which pricked your curiosity. We didn’t stay thenight, but we did celebrate asuitable ceremony at the site … to officially consecrate the ground in honor ofthe ArchDæmon.Perhaps an agency of the Infernal Realm does stalk the circle during the hoursof darkness, but youneed not be surprised that he would not disturb the rest of an official of theChurch of Satan. 328327 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, March 13, VII/1972.328 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, March 30, VII/1972.- 196 -It will be recalled that ex-Stygian member Bill Ingram mentioned the presence ofSatanists fromLouisville at the West/DeHaven curse ritual against Michael Grumboski.Considering the cumulativetrauma of the entire Babylon/ Stygian disaster, this was rather the limit. Icalled the Nineveh Grotto on thecarpet and learned - to my utter surprise - that the visitors had been noneother than Cliff Amos (the GrottoLeader) and his girlfriend. They were promptly expelled from the Church ofSatan.This was the second triphammer blow to hit Nineveh in 1972. A short time earlierStephen Foster, theWarlock who had succeeded me as Grotto Leader, had relinquished his officerather than remove allmarijuana from his home. It is worth noting that in 1972 - and particularly inthe midwest - the civilauthorities did not consider possession of marijuana as a trivial matter. Fosterwas replaced by Amos, oneof the founders of the Grotto, and shortly before this curse ritual developmentI had recommended that hebe considered for the Priesthood.Although the rest of the Grotto had not been involved in this incident, the lossof another GrottoLeader for such a reason proved to be a blow to the Grotto’s morale from whichit would ultimately notrecover. It would survive until Janet’s and my departure from Louisville inJune, then fade gently out ofexistence. To this day I remember it, and the many wonderful ladies andgentlemen who comprised it,with respect and affection.But then, in March/April of 1972, there seemed ample grounds fordisillusionment. Discounting theKarnak and Lilith Grottos, which were still in their formative stages, virtuallyevery Grotto of the Churchof Satan had been a focal point for crisis. Plutonian, Babylon, Typhon, Stygian,Belphegor, and nowNineveh! Had all the work been for naught? Had the writing of the Manual forGrotto Administrationbeen merely an exercise in wishful thinking to which actual Grotto Leaders wouldpay scant if anyattention? So it seemed.For my own part, I had affiliated with the Church of Satan to become a magicianand a philosopher -not to follow in the footsteps of Eliot Ness! Some sober reflection on theprofile of the entire Churchseemed called for. It appeared that Anton LaVey had similar thoughts; in Marchhe observed to me:I guess you are ready for this; your sense of timing and perceptive facultieshave never been out oftouch with the Man Downstairs. I had a short conference with Him last night andwas informed that ourtransition is progressing splendidly. He told me: “Never let the right hand knowwhat the left hand isdoing.” It didn’t take much cud-chewing to figure out the substance of Hisutterance.We have made drastic and frequent changes in the last year, establishingpolicies and breaking them allover the place - commensurate, I might add, with the stability, solvency, anddependability of a largesegment of our membership. Actually our administrative fluctuations have neatlysaved us from thepresumptive acts of many internal malefactors.By the time the likes of Wayne West finish writing their “exposés” of us, wewill no longer bear anyresemblance to that which they have exposed. When the John DeHavens and LarryGreens start comparingnotes about their banishment, a third chap - who was never even a member - willappear with a copy of theCloven Hoof in hand (legitimately), asking: “Haven’t you fellows seen this yet?”Let them who wouldviolate the Sixth Satanic Statement learn the folly of trying to nail custard tothe wall.I’m sure you haven’t forgotten one of the first letters you wrote to me,projecting the hypothesis that asSatanism becomes a reckonable force in the world, so will the formal structureof the Church becomeincreasingly distilled, rejecting external organization out of necessity so thatthe Satanic “gadfly” may begiven freedom to spread and multiply. I reckon that the time has come.As you - and most certainly Janet - know, the Church cannot sustain itself onthe altruism and loyaldedication of its present “supermen” followers. In due time, after conditioninghas been achieved and themovement (not the Church) has grown vast, human potential can be categorizedinto shouters, money-donors, leaders, legitimacy-providers, menial volunteers, etc. - just as pastreligions which have dealt withhuman animals have done. Each person’s respective value can then be extracted,and the Temples andPleasure Domes can be built … according to our plans. And in the process, manwill collectively become awee bit smarter - more understanding of the world around him and of himself.- 197 -At the present time the most vocal element to whom our philosophy appeals isrepresented by the littleguy who wants to be a superman - the guy who has been clobbered all his life andwants to strike back. Itmatters not to him that he might have asked for all his clobberings; he has thelumps to display, and that isreason enough. Our bible lets him think of himself as a sinister avenger, anexterminating angel who candispense with any guilts (or conscience) with which he has been burdened. In hiseager rush to stomp on thenearest crucifix, he reads the Satanic Bible out of context - no differentlythan he would probably read acook book, preparing a lamb stew according to the recipe but leaving out thelamb.The Satanic movement will grow as a result of the Masters of the Church of Satansupplying thegadflies with fodder for their cause. The gadfly with intellect and position -our most influential gadfly -must have the C.H. made available to him without ritualistic or secularcommitment.The low-level gadflies, who suddenly become supermen after one reading of theSatanic Bible, can onlyassist us financially. They won’t, of course, for now they are supermen anddon’t have to entertaincharitable Christian thoughts any longer. Now they can get even with the world.Naturally the first place tostart - like bratty children - is to practice their newfound independence aroundhome with their parents (theChurch). Instead of chastising them, making them stay home, and trying to keepthem in line - which onlymakes them more rebellious - we shall sell them some dope and send them out onthe streets, and they’lllove us for it.I am, of course, writing allegorically. By “dope” I mean trappings for their newroles. They will buymedals to pin all over themselves. I have noticed that the more of a supermancomplex a member harbors,the greater the importance of paraphernalia with which to bedeck himself.Under our present system, members whose ego-needs demand the most trappings arethose who mustcontent themselves with the least. That’s why they “sneak” all manner of ankhs,amulets, talismans, rabbit’sfeet, etc. - from diverse sources - to wear around their necks in addition totheir Baphomets. It kills themthat they must confine their robes to monkish cut and somber hue. Given theirheads, they would mostcertainly look like holy fools. How they would act is too horrible toconjecture. This is why they should noteven be members of the Order. They are gadflies, however - albeit noisome tohave in attendance. Theirconsuming ego-needs can render us an unwitting service in the “stuff” the Churchcan supply them asnonmember gadflies.I have been accused of being commercial for the last six years, often by personswho seem saddenedwhen they finally find out there is nothing much they can buy. Like Hugo vonCastiglione, I do not wish tohurt them any longer, as it is against my nature. We shall start marketingSatanic goodies to low-levelgadflies. When you come out here, we will explore all avenues of this aspect.Now is the time to make the C.H. available to the public on a subscriptionbasis. The high quality youhave presented should be read by those who cannot commit themselves tomembership but are essential toour growth. All potential gadflies - from the convict whose warden will betotally disarmed by the copy ofthe C.H. he has just confiscated, to the chairman of the board of the dog foodcompany who is given a copyby a regional manager. The White witches can read their copies and squirm witheach barb - without thesmugness of knowing that what they clench in their hands has beensurreptitiously obtained.Seventy-five percent of “post-membership intrigue” will be dashed withice-water, and the intriguerswill have to go elsewhere, no longer being able to pursue their juvenile anticsat the Church’s administrative(time and financial) expense. And, last but certainly not least, the C.H. mighthelp to financially support anddevelop the Church. Until now we have been supporting the Church, the Church hasbeen supporting themovement - while seldom giving us credit, or else suitably distorting us fortheir greater capital gain.I know that if we had sufficient capital to place a slick C.H. on the newsstands- between Buckley’sNational Review and Fate - we would capture a starving market overnight. Itappalls what small businesssense I have to reflect on the total absence of even a “witchcraft” monthly ontoday’s stands. Inasmuch asSatanism is a unique phenomenon, such a journal could be developed into averitable way of life, not unlikeone successful life-style journal which started with far less of anall-encompassing credo - even thoughsome may draw a comparison between a nude Altar and a nude centerfold as a primemover, never havingeven read the last four pages of The Circus of Dr. Lao. The present C.H. ,distributed on a nonmembersubscription basis, could pave the way for such a venture.Much as we have attempted to regulate Grotto activity and stability, it appearsthat, for the most part,Yeats’ words again apply: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst arefull of passionate intensity.”- 198 -So long as most Grottos are peopled by searching, rather unstable individuals,we mustn’t deludeourselves into assuming them capable of sustaining any kind of autonomousoperation. As it has existed,Grotto supervision drains far more from our overall progress than itcontributes. With very few exceptions,we will be far better off if we witness the type of Grotto activity we haveseen, performed in the future on anonmember basis.It may appear that we would have been better off had we never instituted Grottosnor admitted themajority of applicants to membership, and never catered to such members oncethey had been accepted.Had we dispensed with such energy-consuming baggage, however, we would not haveestablished anorganization in fact, but merely on paper. Large-scale workings require a livingblueprint. Now that whichhas become common knowledge as existing will continue to exist, but the physicalprops which providedthe imagery have served their purpose and can be discarded.If I seem callous about all this, it’s because the aforementioned props nevercared one hoot in Hell(literally!) about the Church but only employed it as a vehicle for their ownplans toward unearned glory.We are not discarding them, Mike; they are discarding themselves - through thesame imbalance and self-deceit that caused them to think they could deceive us.We gave them dreams of glory, which they promptly mortgaged to the hilt,expecting us to pay the bill.Now we are gradually dimming the light on the magic-lantern slides they havecreated for themselves. Theyoft forget that though we have provided them with a workshop in which to createtheir transparencies, wealso own the power company which supplies illumination for the slide projector.My next book will provide ritual material for nonmember “Grottos” in everyquarter. Your newintroduction will further legitimize the Bible. The C.H. is an ideal medium forwhat we want to say.Membership inquiries continue to increase, but brain surgeons and Congressmenare still in short supply.Clearly increased membership per se will not elevate us beyond our present levelbut only hold usdown. The C.H. in the proper hands will. The rewards obtained by our maintainingcontrol over charteredGrottos are minute compared to the responsibilities we must assume from suchGrotto operations. It all addsup to a need for sharp division between the Church and the movement.We will continue to maintain Agents, simply as contacts for new members. It willthen be up to eachmember to exhibit his desire for expanded contact and/or group activity. Agentswill, in exchange for theirsocially advantageous positions, supply us with monthly reports.We will undoubtedly hear caterwaulings that we have “let down” the members. Idon’t have to tell youmy sentiments on that! We have reached the stage where the only things holdingback Satanism as amovement and the Church of Satan as an influence are the pastoral needs of ourmore dependent members.This, I trust, gives you a fair perspective of the changes being made in mostaspects of the Church, andhow each area will overlap into other realms which comprise the Church of Satanin toto. Certainmodifications will require little more than the revision of some of our printedforms. Other changes dependmore upon adjustment of our mental attitude (i.e. a reformed personalityprojected to the public by theChurch). We are well into the metamorphosis here at 6114, and I can already see- and feel - the change. Itis a most pleasant sensation.Diane will be sending off some of the revised forms, a tape of a couple ofarchetypical low-levelgadflies (infuriating at first, but almost amusing in retrospect), and somespecific information on how thiswill all be put into practice now that it has been conceived in the CentralBrain. 329It took me several weeks to ponder this approach. I thought that I could seewhat Anton was trying todo - to remove organizational obstacles impeding the smooth, free exercise oftheoretical Satanism.I was somewhat concerned, however, that what might ultimately happen was thatthe fact of theChurch of Satan as a true institution - not just a name for an abstraction -might suffer. In hisdisillusionment and frustration, Anton might be throwing Rosemary’s Baby outwith the bathwater.The goal, it seemed to me, was to reform and refine the organization - notdispense with it. Thiscalled for tougher membership standards and for a nationwide Priesthood that wastruly responsive to the329 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 6, VII/1972.- 199 -Central Grotto - and which had enough freedom of action so that it need not beoverly concerned withsecular professional prejudice and reprisals. To Anton I wrote:Thank you for your letter of the 6th. I regret the delay in my reply, but Iwanted to take the time toprovide some well thought-out responses to the many new policies you set forth.That letter certainly flungopen Pandora’s Box, all right. For the sake of clarity, let me divide the restof this letter into sections:I. Church Membership: As you pointed out, it is increasingly clear that there isa large percentage of“deadwood” in the membership at large. As individuals many, if not most of themembers are a risk to theimage of the Church. Their mental organization and coherence of speech/writingis such that I would notdare to refer journalists or outsiders to them. This is in spite of the factthat some of them - such asZabrecky and Seago - are obviously honest and well-meaning. But they simply donot project an elitistimage, and the propaganda of the Church states conclusively that our members arecarefully selected fromelite elements.As I see it, there are two alternatives: (1) a large-scale purge of the“deadwood” element, or (2) officialacknowledgment that the first two degrees of membership in the Church do notnecessarily comprise themagical expertise of which we speak. The second alternative would also mean theshifting of attention fromthe entire Church of Satan to the Order of the Trapezoid. [Note: At this timethe Order of the Trapezoid stillmeant the Priesthood: the III°-V° - M.A.] The Church would appear as a“testing-ground” for the Order.Of course this situation already exists in a private sense, but the importantpoint is that the nation stillviews the entire Church as representative of Anton LaVey’s philosophicalexpertise. As a result there hasbeen a great deal of damage to your image via the ineptitude of your evident“aides”.Alternative #2 would be the easier step to take, but for all intents andpurposes it would herald theextinction of the Church of Satan in favor of the Order of the Trapezoid.Considering the great appeal of theChurch’s name, and your own commitment to it, I think that the first alternativewould be preferable.Recommendation: The Central Grotto should review all existing membership files.All those memberswho are noncontributing “deadwood” or who display embarrassing mannerisms(letters written in crayon onbinder-paper, preschool grammar, intellectual idiocy, de facto White witchapproach, etc.) should be markedfor quiet expulsion at the end of their present Active Membership period. Thusthe entire process wouldtake about one year to complete. The final criterion should simply be: Does thisindividual actuallyrepresent the ideal member of the Church of Satan? I am well aware that such ameasure could mean thedecimation of the participating membership from 250-300 to 25-30. The questionis one of the ultimatestature of the Church. Either way it is a crossing of the Rubicon.II. Membership Entrance Criteria: It should be about as easy to gain entrance tothe Church of Satanas it is to secure a junior executive position in a nationwide corporation. Formembers of the post-WorldWar II generation this is going to mean [with almost no exceptions] anaccredited college diploma atminimum. Today such a diploma is more or less equal to the secondary schooldiploma of pre-WWII days,and the establishment of such a standard will immediately disqualify all thosewho seek status through theChurch for which they are too lazy to work in daily life.Recommendation: Effective immediately, establish the requirement that allapplicants under age 25present evidence of at least a Bachelor’s degree from an accredited college. Atthe same time it should bemade clear that such a degree would not in itself guarantee admission. Personsover 25 would be consideredon an individual-case basis, since they have had other opportunities to achieve.Recommendation: Expand the membership questionnaire to show credit and characterreferences, pastemployment record, military record if any, and personal history, achievements,and recognitions.Recommendation: Increase the initial membership fee to $50. Increase the annualrenewal fee to $20.Eliminate the reduced rate for couples, as each member would be considered as anindividual. This willeffectively eliminate those who join the Church with casual intentions (i.e.parasitic trend-followers).III. The Priesthood: The need for a nationwide network of III° personnel iscritical. Our advertisedposture of 10,000+ members is endangered when I cannot produce, for example, asingle III° in New YorkCity. Among other things the increased fees will, in the long run, permit theChurch to offer financialcompensation to its officials for their time. Besides providing an incentive formembers to considerchanging their status from volunteer (II°) to official (III°), this would givethe Central Grotto a materiallever to use when dealing with non-producers. If a person - even a Priest -feels that he is strictly a- 200 -“volunteer”, he does not feel quite the same obligation to his responsibilitiesthat he would were he beingpaid for his work. It is possible that this would commercialize the III° to someextent, but, frankly, you needsome commercially minded workhorses at the III° level.IV. The IV° and V°: In the eventuality of a salary for Priests and Priestesses,Masters would receive nosuch salary - only itemized reimbursements for office expenses. To ensurecrystal-clear motives at thispolicy-making level, a profit motive should remain absent.V. Popular Commercialism: I can see no harm in making all of our presentcommercial devices(amulets, posters, records, etc.) available to the public. I think that theSigil of Baphomet should beregistered as a trademark, however, and that the present color-scheme ofBaphomet medallions should beretained as private. A special Baphomet (such as red-on-black) could be madeavailable for purchase andwear strictly by nonmembers of the Church itself.VI. The Cloven Hoof: According to its present administrative design, the C.H. isfunctioning atmaximum capacity and cannot expand beyond the 300 issue per month level. Due tothe necessity toprevent mimeograph reverse-printing, each new 12-page issue requiresapproximately 12 hours just tomimeograph. There are only the two of us to do the binding, folding, stuffing,stamping, addressing, andsealing, as the use of any Nineveh personnel would reveal the actual extent ofthe national membership. Anincrease in circulation beyond the 300-odd level will require a redesign of theproduction process.There are two other factors which advise against the rapid expansion of the Hoofat this precisemoment. First, the newsletter is not yet at a level of sophistication where itcan compete with commercialpublications. This will take at least another year. I do think that it ismarkedly better than the best that theWhite witches have to offer, but that in itself isn’t saying very much.Martello’s prose would have beenrejected by a grammar-school publication. Ditto 99% of his competition. Iconsider it a very real possibilitythat the Hoof will eventually attain the stature of a national magazine, but itwill take time, a paid staff of III° assistants, and one Hell of a research and writing effort.Secondly, the existing Church membership (at least on a nationwide basis) seesthe C.H. as the basicfactor distinguishing members from nonmembers. If we had more III° officials,this situation would notexist. But, in the event that you should decide to retain the Church as anorganization for the masses and notfor a comparatively small elite, you will lose members by “opening” the Hoof tothe public. Also the paperitself will be prevented from publishing all but the most bland critiques, asthose who read it will notnecessarily have committed themselves on behalf of the Church. At the presenttime no person receives thepaper who, in damaging the Church, would not damage his own reputation as beinga member of thatorganization. This is a very effective safeguard.Recommendation: The Central Grotto should withhold further advertisement of an“open” ClovenHoof until this summer, when we will have had a chance to work out theproduction/economic systems ofthe paper so that they can handle the projected load. As mentioned previously,this will most likely mean theswitch to photo-offset printing, postal franking, and possiblyAddressograph/IBM-type mailing lists as well.In the long run it will be necessary to design a production process whereby eachissue passes throughyour hands prior to printing. At the present time this is impossible due totime-lag and production deadlines,but it is not a good system in that I might inadvertently publish somethingwhich does not reflect thefeelings of the Central Grotto. It is the Central Grotto “voice”, and theCentral Grotto should have a firmcontrol over it.Some other C.H. observations: While I am receiving a great amount of mail(letters, articles, etc.), mostof it is worthless for inclusion in issues. By intentionally minimizing “nutletters” in the paper, I hope toencourage people like Marcello Truzzi to contribute articles. At present, when Ihave space to fill, I mustfinally rely upon myself. And, while I know that I am an unusually brilliantauthor (!), this also is nothealthy for the paper. While my style may be interesting for a short time, itwould become boring in thelong run. Contributions will have to increase before the Hoof can compete forthe big-time. 330Off went the letter, but I wasn’t too terribly happy with it, and neither, as itturned out, was Janet. Itsrecommendations seemed too “IBM 3-button” - to borrow Joe Daniels’ term - andtoo “practical” at the330 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, March 27, VII/1972.- 201 -expense of intrinsic authenticity. The spectre of a Satanic A.M.O.R.C. loomed.The following day I sentanother letter to Anton:After I arrived home last night, Janet and I got into quite a long discussionconcerning some of thepoints brought up in my 3/27 letter. We both thought that some of the ideasshould be forwarded to you as afollow-up to that letter:Jan was of the opinion that the criterion of a college-level degree for a Churchmembership requirementwould be too restrictive. She argued that some individuals are able to achievepositions of note in society inspite of the lack of such a degree, and that the degree in itself does notnecessarily constitute a certificate ofintelligence, so to speak. She also raised the question of many girls who quitschool themselves in order toput their husbands through. Subsequent familial demands then preclude them fromattaining their owndegrees.My response was that the America of 1970 is not that of 1940, and thatpractically no person under 25can expect to get anywhere today without getting that degree - and that studentloans, scholarships, etc.destroy the argument that one must be wealthy to complete an education. Icommented that I personallycould think of no dropout of my own generation who could qualify for ourdefinition of what a Satanistshould be: a “prime mover” of humanity. I do think Jan made a good point aboutthe girls, though, and webegan to consider what other criteria might be better than a degree.After about an hour’s debate [while stuffing the April Hoof], we arrived at theidea of expanding the I°questionnaire to include a lengthy, written essay portion on why the applicantwishes to join. It should befairly easy to tell from that, said Jan, whether a person has a brain or not. Itwould also indicate theapplicant’s command of language and reasoning ability. Thus the fact and not themethod of an individual’seducation would be evaluated.In concept the applicant would be instructed that at least a one-page,typewritten essay would beexpected in answer to such a question. The question itself could be somethinglike: “Why do you wish tojoin the Church of Satan?” - or - “Discuss the Satanic philosophy as it appliesto your personal experiencesto date.” Or it could be more than one question.We both thought that inclusion of credit and character references on theapplication form would be agood idea. In addition to reinforcing the image of the Church as a forthright,aboveground organization,such a measure would discourage persons who feel “secretly ashamed” of joining.This is the type of personwho becomes “deadwood”, because he or she is too intimidated by the fear ofdiscovery to do anythingconsequential on behalf of the Church.Instead of arbitrarily purging the existing membership, Jan recommended that thedecision to retain orrelease individuals could be done simply by sending each member the revised I°questionnaire upon theoccasion of his Active expiration. If his answers are good, he stays. If not, hedoesn’t. But in either case hehas had a chance to show his worth. I think that this is a good idea.We then turned to the question of fees. Jan pointed out that many young peoplesimply could not affordhigh fees. I said that $50 to join would not be out of the question for ourgeneration, and that those who arein the throes of pressing financial difficulties are usually not those who arewell-organized in their personalaffairs. I also said that higher revenue for the Church would require part- orfull-time III° officials and amore sophisticated publications program; each member would receive substantialreturn for his investment.Jan suggested another approach. On the questionnaire ask each applicant theamount of his monthlysalary/total income. Don’t even mention a membership fee until the applicant hascompleted and returnedthe questionnaire. Then, presuming that he meets the achievement qualifications,we calculate 10% of hisincome. If it is sufficiently high (?), 10% of one month’s income is quoted tohim as his initial fee. A basefigure - possibly $50 - might be set to disqualify the welfare people. But Janpointed out that medicalstudents on a tight budget, for instance, shouldn’t be penalized due to theirlimited financial status.Jan also recommended a hard and fast time limit for the I° questionnaire. If theapplicant does not returnit within, say, three weeks, he is written off.We both feel that the idea of either a part-time or full-time paid Priesthood isan idea worth researchingfurther. The Church needs some action-men - not just in San Francisco but aroundthe country - to whom itcan give orders. In concept such Priests and Priestesses would be required tomaintain a ritual chamber towhich registered members could have reasonable access, answer questions andcorrespondence with- 202 -members in their assigned areas, notify those members of local and regionalactivities, and perform otherduties as directed by the Central Grotto.The present system, wherein Grotto Leaders/Regional Agents act on only acommission basis, has justnot proven itself adequate. And, as I suggested in my last letter, there is nosense of obligation on the partof the person. Ultimately he does only as much as he wants, not what the CentralGrotto thinks is necessary.As for the funds to pay such III° representatives, they would come from theincreased Central Grottofees for membership and renewal. Initially people may bitch about the raise, butit will be pointed out thatthey will be receiving an increased return for their increased investment. Thereis a side bonus: Wheneveryone pays for a program of national/regional/local activities whether heattends or not, he will be morelikely to participate and not become “deadwood”.There are some unsolved problems, of course. We would need to identify andinterest the potential III°types, and some type of training program would be almost unavoidable. Perhapsthese are some of thequestions we can address this summer.Well, that’s as far as we got last night. After finishing up the Hoof, welistened to that tape. Ourcomment: There is nothing to prevent those individuals from conducting their ownactivities if they’re sohot for them. What they really want is for someone from Central to make a bigsplash in their localcommunity - maybe even start a riot - while they bask in the publicity. Theyknow enough about Satanismto talk about it, so let ’em paddle their own canoe. As for the “drivel” in theC.H. , all they have to do is sendme something better! I’d be just as happy to have everyone else do all thatwriting.331A few days later a second letter arrived from Anton LaVey, written prior to hisreceipt of either ofmine. He too, it seemed, had been giving further thought to the subject:Since Diane was uncertain precisely how I meant the matters covered in my lastletter to beimplemented, we began discussing it prior to her writing to you. As it turnedout, I decided it would besimpler to just dictate the letter.Grottos: Grottos will be started by whoever wishes to do so. No immediateauthorizations will beissued, however. Instead, if a Grotto has proven itself satisfactory after areasonable period of operation, aprobationary (6-month) charter will be given. Revisions to the Manual for GrottoAdministration will makeit relevant to all member-operated Grottos, chartered or not. In short, onlygroups who have proventhemselves worthy will be considered for Grotto authorization. There will be noapplications honoredinsofar as Grotto authorization is concerned.Let our members learn the true meaning of lesser magic before they aspire to anyhigher station. Wewill not honor beggars. We will consider those whose patience, tact, diplomacy,and contributions speak forthem. Non-authorized Grottos must inform us of their activities via non-nuisancecommunication if theywish to be considered for official authorization. The merit of a potentialGrotto Leader will be judged not byhow many questions he can ask “to ensure that he does the right thing”, butrather by how many “rightthings” he does without asking questions.Priesthood: Priests will be selected by the Council from suitable candidates.That is to say, those whohave exhibited sufficient prerequisites will be appointed as candidates for thePriesthood. After passing thepreliminary requirements, Priests or Priestesses will be installed for a periodof one year, during which timetheir conduct will be observed. The “no news is good news” premise - that afirst-year Priest who isn’theard from is assumed to be all right, hence being elevated to formal ordination- will not be honored.Exceptions will be made, of course, for Priests in relatively isolated areas.Because of their prestigiouspositions, they will not be expected to function on a pastoral basis.Probationary Priests and Priestesses will be expected to communicate theiractivities to the Council on aregular (monthly) basis. They will hold the title of Reverend or Priestess. Theywill be able to solemnizemarriages, etc. and to wear the vestments of the Priesthood. If a Priest acts asGrotto Leader, theresponsibility of the Grotto’s operation rests on his shoulders. In most cases,successful Grotto operationover a reasonable period of time carries with it some recommendation to thePriesthood for its Leader.331 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, March 28, VII/1972.- 203 -Again, no applications will be considered for the Priesthood. Appointment isgranted throughobservation over a reasonable period of time. As it stands, there are severalpersons who should be grantedcandidacy who have neither been recommended by others nor have asked on theirown to be considered forelevation. Persons like Seago, Zabrecky, Grumboski, DeCecco, Ethel, etc., thoughnot property-owners orfamily men, have proven quite stable and not asked for favors nor made nuisancesof themselves. No harmcan be done by letting them know that their patience is paying off.The Priesthood test must be revised to eliminate inane questions and addpertinent ones. I’m stillwaiting for Adrian’s suggestions in this regard. I know pretty much whichquestions I’ll eliminate, and Ihave some questions I’ll be adding, but I would like to hear from you, Janet,and Adrian before finalizingthe test. [Grumboski, of course, would not be expected to take the new test. Histest looks good, but I amstill undecided on the other aspects of his candidacy. His durability has beenshown - surprisingly so -during the Stygian business.]Agents: Agents are basically contacts for new members. An Agent can be a Priest,Grotto Leader, or laymember. His prime requisite is his sense of responsibility, his second hisability to articulate Satanism. Eventhough he may not be the best judge of character, if he is responsible anddiscovers a fly in the ointment, hewill say something about it to us. He won’t either let it go unheeded or getupset over the discomfort therevelation has caused him and quit his post. Agents, as with other matterscovered herein, will be appointedon a prior qualification basis. Agents are to communicate their activities on aregular basis, reporting onnew contacts as they appear and on old ones as they survive.Cloven Hoof: All new subscriptions will be distinguished from membership copiesby an “S” in thecorner of the address label. Subscribers will be notified that their renewal isdue via an inserted slip of paperworded the same for members as for subscribers: “Your membership/subscriptionexpires …” The NRAuses this method, leading subscribers to occasionally believe that they aremembers, but so what? They’llcrow like it anyway! Actual memberships will be processed separately.Amulets: New amulets are being made by a commercial firm which appears to dobeautiful work.[Note: Anton is not referring to the famous Wolf-Brown medallions, but to anearlier metal/paint amulet. -M.A.] So far only I° amulets have been ordered, the initial cash outlay beingconsiderable. Amulets forother degrees will continue at present to be made by hand, but consistency will(hopefully) be morecarefully maintained. At present no catalogue sheets for assorted handcraftedamulets for divers purposes(lust, wealth, etc.) are being sent out. When the aforementioned quality controlis properly evidenced, wemay resume mailing the sheet. Though I appreciate primitive art and have nothingagainst Grandma Moses,I have been ashamed to have sent some of the chimp-amulet-art our “craftsmen”have turned out.After the first of April, when Diane’s tax-accounting is out of the way, we’llbegin considering changesneeded for the Manual for Grotto Administration. The next issue of the C.H.should carry some generalinformation extracted from this and my last letter. Diplomacy is your forte, asI’ve said on more than oneoccasion, so I will leave how much to say and how much to imply to yourdiscretion. Here again yourPSYOP-indoctrinated shrewdness should serve you in good stead.I’ve begun work on my next book, but this time I’m not going to make the mistakeof giving myself animpossible deadline. Actually I have partial drafts of other future works, butthe one on which I’m presentlyspending the most time deals with something I feel might provide Satanists witha needed “schtick”. If itreally catches on, it could become as popularly accepted a phenomenon as theFreudian slip. Certainly itwill result in the creation of a new descriptive term - such as “psychicvampire” has become. More on thisas it begins to take shape.Incidentally Diane reminded me that you would probably be wondering why the bigmystery over theSatanic Rituals, insofar as other members knowing about it. I have kept the booka secret merely to avoidsomeone getting wind of it and grinding out a quickie with the same theme andtitle. These small outfits -such as the ones which publish Martello’s and Buckland’s books - are known forsuch actions. It would beduck soup for someone - like West or Martello - to whip up something, using noneof my material (exceptperhaps bits and pieces picked up here and there) but calling it the SatanicRituals and protecting his “goodname” with a pseudonym. I’ve seen this happen with other ideas of mine - sooften, in fact, that Dianemaintains I shouldn’t even think about certain projects unless I’m engaged intheir actual production.- 204 -On the subject of Martello: I prefer not to have his Black Magic, Satanism, andVoodoo - or even thecorrection he suggests [see enclosed] - discussed in the Hoof. So unless you’vealready reviewed it in theApril issue, let’s not give him free publicity. He’d like nothing better than tobe kicked by the Cloven Hoof!In case you haven’t seen a copy of the book, he juxtaposes what I consider thebest part of the interviewso that most readers would assume that he is doing the talking, not I. Moreoverthat part is so botched upthat it’s nearly impossible to describe the “printer’s error”. It does seemrather ironic, though, that the onepart highlighted by a double-spaced break in text begins: “I suppose I’m as mucha pervert as the nextSatanist …” - which is clearly myself talking!I shall not waste precious time or vital magical energy composing a glib retortto Martello’s claim(undoubtedly truthful) that some of his readers realized that the “Q&A format”(used elsewhere in the bookwith the “A” denoting Martello) was the LaVey interview. I am simply not theright personality to do verbalbattle with “dish queens” (gay parlance for one who thrives on dishing the dirt,in case you’re unfamiliarwith the term). Such bitchiness invariably evokes a contrivedly nonintellectualresponse from me - such as"},{"pageContent":"would not come off well printed in Martello’s next book!I’ve learned to let these types think they’ve had the last word, for they cannotlive with themselves ifthey think someone else has had it. 332 [index_split_008.html#p204]Leo Louis Martello, who could only have been spawned by New York City, was oneof the morebizarre phenomena of the “occult revival” of the 1960s. He claimed to be aSicilian witch, sparredintermittently with any other White witches who chanced to cross his path, andwrote paperbacks onwitchcraft, magic, and hypnotism memorable chiefly for their provocativecover-art. He proclaimedhimself head of a “Witches Liberation Movement” and WICA (Witches InternationalCraft Associates);and he published Witchcraft Magazine and the WICA Newsletter. This last item, a4-page, typewritten,offset bulletin, set a new world’s record for (a) number of strikeovers and (b)number of afterthoughts cut& pasted in available margins. Its conversational tone may be appreciated fromthe following glimpsefrom page #1 of a mid-1972 issue (all sic):Psychic Attack Telegram TELEGRAM RECEIVED MAY 25: “Leo you subj of occ attack byH, S, B, theA’s, and groups got words is extra soon. Suggest protection now emphatic. S.writes under names of P.H.,E.F., etc etc. SSS.” I omitted names in above.

If it comes back then obviously a phony (possible to have UNLISTEDnumber but no such thing asan UNLISTED address!). I don’t doubt for a minute that those named are capableof such an attack. I onlyhope that it’s TRUE.

Unlike Raymond Buckland, who seems to havefelt threatened orchallenged by the Church of Satan’s existence from the very beginning, Martelloseemed cheerfullyunconcerned with it except insofar as it might comment on specific Wiccaconcerns. “Everybody,” hewrote to me, “can go to Hell on his own banana peel.” 334[index_split_008.html#p204]332 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 16, VII/1972.333 Leo Martello, WICA Newsletter #17, 1972, page #1.334 Letter, Leo Martello to M.A. Aquino, February 19, 1972.- 205 -Martello’s interview with Anton LaVey, included in Black Magic, Satanism, andVoodoo, isreproduced as Appendix #53. Anton may not have personally written to Martelloconcerning it, but amythical friend of Lana Green’s and John M. Kincaid’s by the name of “Roy B.Hoyle” did:Dr. LaVey is in Europe at the present time, so has not had an opportunity toread your latest book;however, we have apprised him of the situation concerning the printing mixup.Needless to say, he was notpleased.We have perused the book, and though the segments dealing with the Church ofSatan and Dr. LaVeyappear most objective, the printing errors lead the reader to assume that all ofthe writing on pp 119-20 isyour own, inasmuch as you have employed a single-person question and answerformat elsewhere in thebook. If you print a correction of this mistake in the next issue of your WICANewsletter and make thenecessary corrections in any subsequent printings of the book, no further actionwill be taken. Thank you. 335The “Sicilian Cyclone”, as Martello styled himself, was not cowed. To “Hoyle” heretorted (all sic):I’m the AUTHOR of BLACK MAGIC, SATANISM & VOODOO. I am NOT its publisher orprinter.Dr. LaVey can’t be any more displeased than I am. Frankly, I consider yourletter and its tone out of order. Idon’t take kindly to the veiled threat of “no further action will be taken.”“Action?” Against whom? For what? If I publish the notice of the error it’sbecause of my own integritynot because you request it or Dr. LaVey’s displeasure or anything else. But Iwill be the final judge ofthat. 336In the months to come I would have a rather amusing encounter of my own withMartello, but inMarch of 1972 I contented myself with printing a correction to the confusedinterview in the Cloven Hoofand speculating that, “were Raymond Buckland to have sampled Dr. Jekyll’s famouspotion, somethinglike Leo Louis Martello would probably be the result”.By the end of March Anton had received my two letters and had had an opportunityto consider themin light of his own communiqués. He wrote to me:The latest issue of the C.H. is, in my opinion, the best yet. Naturally I wouldlike to see some of ourliterary members contribute (and they should), but the quality you have injectedis far better than you giveyourself credit for. Don’t worry about an overwhelming increase in membershipsor subscriptions. As thedilemma arrives, we shall modify production accordingly.While we must always set our sights high, we must realize our temporallimitations. As things presentlystand, we are actually in better shape than ever before. Without clearing outmore than a handful oftroublesome members, the air has become reasonably fresh. As others attemptdiscord, they will bejettisoned, but I do not believe our general membership are troublemakers. True,there is much deadwood,but they do not concern me unless they kick up a fuss. I wouldn’t want mydaughter to marry one, nor areporter to interview one, but, like the extras in the chorus, they fill up thestage.Now that we have given inquirers a choice of membership or subscription, so farevery respondent haschosen membership, despite the discouragements presented. The new flyer has beenrevealing in thatrespect.In addition, the new respondents seem to [yes!] be of a slightly higher caliberthan prior applicants. Inview of this apparent improvement, I feel we should give ourselves a few monthsto test these initialchanges before proceeding. I don’t think there will be a sudden increase in newmemberships. As I saidbefore, however, if such a situation occurs, we will revamp production measures.Meanwhile we are gainingground as a movement, and that is often what it takes to get a message across.335 Letter, “Roy B. Hoyle” to Leo Martello, February 28, VII/1972.336 Letter, Leo Martello to “Roy B. Hoyle”, March 7, 1972.[index-206_1.jpg]- 206 -Don’t worry about membership figures. The media say what they want to hear andwhat everyone elsewants to hear. The public doesn’t care about factual statistics; they inventtheir own figures to suit theirwishes. If we have 10 members, the press will still say we have 20,000. Ibelieve the last quote I saw inprint was 100,000!The worst thing we can do is to get spooked about the media. When they want tochampion or exploitsomebody, they lie and give undue credit. If they want to discredit someone,they will lie to do that too.Worrying about the whims of the press is the surest way to incur theirperversity. The main thing is thatthe source (us) is honest and that it shows through to those who count. When Isay “honest”, I mean it in thetruest sense - as benign, noble human beings. In a world constructed largely ofbullshit, a little truth goes along way.I will send something for inclusion in the C.H. later this week. And I’ll see ifI can stoke the fire a bitand elicit some contributions from others as well. Diane and I know only toowell what you and Jan are upagainst.Frankly I don’t really care what those you might choose as assistants mightthink about the paltrycirculation of the Hoof. If they fancy themselves as elite, they should behappy. If not, then they want tobelong to a vast movement - one with little time for the concerns of eachmember. Actually most of ourmembers want both - or don’t know what they want.Take whatever help you can get and don’t worry unduly. I’m convinced weeventually do the best thing,even if we sometimes go about it in peculiar ways. 337A preface to the next quotation is in order: Anton LaVey’s letters wereinevitably meticulous inappearance and content. The slightest typographical error frequently caused himto insist that the entirepage be redone. This point being made, I may now relate that, for his April 11thbirthday, Janet and I senthim a Louisville specialty: a box of chocolates filled with the finest KentuckyBourbon. A rather mangledenvelope arrived from San Francisco a short time later, and within it was thefollowing:337 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 31, VII/1972.[index-207_1.jpg]- 207 -My tour of duty as a Captain on the faculty of the U.S. Army Armor School atFort Knox wasscheduled to come to an end in June of 1972, as I had decided to exchange myRegular Army commissionfor one in the Reserve and pursue a civilian career in Santa Barbara,California.During the spring of 1972, therefore, I endeavored to stabilize the midwesternand eastern operationsof the Church of Satan, hoping that the young, fragile structure that had beenbuilt up during the previous18 months would manage to survive the demoralizing scandals in Detroit, Dayton,and Louisville.Warlock Gary Walker, another founding member of Nineveh, took over that Grottountil a short timeafter Janet’s and my departure in June. By late summer, however, it was clearthat Nineveh would befollowing Babylon and Stygian into oblivion.In Detroit only the Belphegor Grotto still maintained a precarious existenceunder the leadership ofDouglas Robbins, but his reports to the Central Grotto had become more and moreinfrequent.The prime movers of any Satanic renaissance in the east, it would seem, wouldhave to be the newgeneration of Priests and Priestesses who were coming to prominence through theRegional Agent system.In the east, III° tests had been sent to Michael Grumboski, L. Dale Seago,Lilith Sinclair, and Robert Ethel[of Washington, D.C.].A Second Eastern Regional Conference was scheduled for the weekend of Walpurgis(April 28-30) inLouisville, and it seemed increasingly probable that the northeast and centraleast coast would now berepresented.As the time for the Conference approached, Dale Seago traveled afield once moreto visit theAssociation for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) - the “institutional shadow”of Edgar Cayce - inVirginia Beach, Virginia. He found the A.R.E. mildly interesting, but his routetook him on a more fatefulside-excursion, as related to me in April:Enclosed is a copy of my brief report to the Central Grotto on the A.R.E. I alsopaid a visit to theChrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia. One of their recent acquisitions is astatue, about six feet high, ofthe goddess Sekhmet. The paintings did not interest me especially, but thesecond floor contains the mostbeautiful glassware I have ever seen - particularly some old Burmese specimens.338Thus did Dale Seago make the acquaintance of Sekhmet. For years he would puzzleover the strangesensations he had felt upon confronting the Egyptian lion-goddess for the firsttime, but not until 1975 didhe Understand them.A few days later came a note from Diane LaVey informing me of the firstPriesthoods to be conferredin the east since Janet’s. It was neither as formal nor as enthusiastic as onemight expect:338 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, April 17, VII/1972.- 208 -Hang on to your horns: Grumboski was elevated to the III° [and so was LilithSinclair]. I keep assuringmyself that one day I’ll look back on all this and laugh about how I cringed andshook every time Anton didsomething I felt apprehensive about. Maybe it’ll make good reading when I getaround to writing TheDevil’s Bride [or some such thing]! Oh, well, Shai is a good chap … and you aregoing to have that talkwith him about his literary prowess, aren’t you [please!]? And there is thatyear’s probationary!339This letter is less indicative of Diane’s feelings towards Grumboski andSinclair as individuals than itis revealing of the general apprehension she and Anton were now feeling towardsordinations ofindividuals who were not closely and directly tied to the Central Grotto.Doubtless the LaVeys recalledhow close Cliff Amos and John DeHaven had come to the III°, and of course theBabylon disaster hadbeen precipitated by the first non-Central Grotto Priest, Wayne West.Diane needn’t have worried, however, as Michael Grumboski and Lilith Sinclairwent on to becometwo of the Church of Satan’s most distinguished and effective representatives inthe east during the nextthree years. Indeed it is correct to say that they were the authority of theChurch in the Midwest and Eastrespectively, since the activities in those areas were largely a function oftheir direct leadership or indirectexample.The Second Eastern Regional Conference began with a private banquet inLouisville’s most famousand atmospheric restaurant, the Old House. Dale Seago flew in from NorthCarolina; Michael Grumboskiand Suzanne McDonald drove down from Detroit; and from Dayton came TomHuddleston with abeautiful blonde Witch named Colleen Geske [soon to become Mrs. T. Huddleston].But the distancerecord was established by Warlock Michael McQuown from the Lilith Grotto.Three outside visitors were also allowed to attend: the Religion Editor of TimeMagazine, who hadflown in from the Time-Life headquarters to do a cover story on the new wave ofthe occult; and Jack andBetty Cheetham, two professional photographers from San Francisco, Californiawith an introductionfrom the LaVeys.At the Saturday evening ritual Grumboski was formally ordained to the Priesthoodof Mendes in theNineveh Ritual Chamber, receiving from me the III° medallion Anton LaVey hadpresented me on theoccasion of my own ordination, and altogether it was a grand and gloriousweekend. Tom Huddlestonwrote:Our deepest thanks again for giving us a most splendid time in Louisville lastweekend. Both Colleenand I will remember it as one of the highlights of our membership in the Churchof Satan. It occurred to usonly after we arrived back in Dayton that it was probably the last time we wouldbe seeing you and Jan. Ihope that we may continue correspondence after you are settled in California.340A reflective observation also arrived from Grumboski, who had arrivedunexpectedly early for theConference - to catch Janet making morning coffee and me in the shower:I wish to thank both you and your charming wife Janet for making my day ofordination so memorable.But next time please give me a little more forewarning! Miss McDonald and I havetaken it upon ourselvesto bestow awards for this Conference. Unto Janet we give the Silver EncrustedDoughnut, an awardpresented only at 7:30 AM. To you a robe woven from spiderwebs, which can beseen only by early arriversand should be hung in the living room for convenience’s sake. And - thank youagain - I will prize your giftof the III° medallion. I do hope it retains some of your gifted writing skills…341339 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 18, VII/1972.340 Letter, Tom Huddleston to M.A. Aquino, May 2, VII/1972.341 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, May 2, VII/1972.- 209 -Michael McQuown had quickly become a focus of interest at the conference - notjust because he wasour first face-to-face contact with the Lilith Grotto, but also because he was awitty conversationalist withByronesque good looks. Everyone took a liking to him, and he and I began anintermittentcorrespondence. One of his earliest letters to me contained a quote from aRegional Agent named WilliamF. Murray, then living in Stateline, Nevada:“Our attitude here is not ‘sure, here’s an application - and we will take yourmoney - and welcome tothe Church of Satan’. It is our attitude that membership in the Church of Satanis something that must bestriven for - an achievement of acceptance that is the culmination of one lifeand the first step into another.There are several persons in the region who have expressed an interest in theChurch - and are receivingsome sort of instruction from us - but - until they take the step - in no waywill we give them a free ride.” 342The only apparent problem with McQuown was his interest in mundane gossip, whichresulted in mywriting him more than one letter advising him to focus his interest elsewhere. Iwasn’t too greatlyconcerned about it, and neither was Lilith Sinclair, since McQuown’s talents andservices to the Churchwere many. It developed, however, that the LaVeys did not care for his curiosity- at least where itconcerned them.In early May I sent a letter to Anton LaVey recounting the results of theWalpurgis gathering. I wasvery pleased with both the events themselves and with the quality of those whohad attended:The conference couldn’t have gone better! There were a total of 16 personsthere, including the 3people from Time, and all enjoyed themselves immensely. The discussions weresophisticated andenthusiastic, and the ritual - at which I ordained Michael Grumboski to thePriesthood - went off without asingle hitch.This was my first look at Michael McQuown and Dale Seago, and they are both thenicest possible sortof people. Seago especially is most definitely a good bet for the III°. Speakingof which, it was verysatisfying to see Shai receive the degree. His emotions upon receiving the honorwere very obvious, and Ithink he will be a great asset to the Black Order. 343Michael Grumboski was going to be one of the two members of the Priesthood inthe East, and I wasvery glad to have seen him rise to the occasion of his ordination and to thedebates and discussions of theconference as strongly as he did.He had undergone an almost startling change from the quiet, somewhat nervousindividual whom Ihad first seen at John DeHaven’s. Perhaps then he had not known the extent ofhis own strength, either ofresolve or of leadership, and the trials of the Stygian crisis had shown himwhat he could do. Physically hewas still the “skinny fella” he joked about in his letters, but his demeanor wasnow one of dignity andauthority. He seemed to be everybody’s friend - but nobody’s fool. To him Iwrote:It was especially good to see you ordained to the Priesthood of Mendes. I thinkit is certainly a duehonor in light of the many services you have performed for the Church of Satan.There has never beforebeen a society quite like that of the Order of the Trapezoid, and I am confidentthat you will derive a highpersonal satisfaction from your office as a Satanic Priest.Over a period of time you will be made aware of the actual nature of the BlackOrder and the task it ischarged to fulfill. Obviously we did not have an opportunity to take up suchmatters at the conference. Wehave gone far beyond the limits of traditional and popular occultism, and I donot believe I am beingidealistic when I affirm that the Church of Satan may well be one of the mostcrucial organizations ever toemerge on this planet.342 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, May 4, VII/1972.343 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, May 5, VII/1972.- 210 -In the meantime, of course, we have a great deal to accomplish down in the“arena”. Our primary taskis still to clarify the nature of Satanism to the influential segment of thepublic. I don’t expect that themasses will ever accept our philosophy [how could they?], but we need tosolidify our stature among thedecision-makers of the country. And this is, of necessity, the reason behind ourannounced ethical strictness.Otherwise we should find ourselves relegated to the loony-bin of religiouseccentricity.As a Priest you are considered to be past the point where duties must bedirectly assigned to you. Youare now to rely upon your own initiative where possible, contacting the CentralGrotto or myself when youwish advice in a given situation. You should also keep us informed of youractions, intentions, and decisionsas they occur.Priestess Lilith Sinclair and you are now the senior representatives of theChurch in the eastern areas ofthe United States. You should endeavor to consult with one another as regularlyas possible. As a startingidea you might consider the possibility of a Third Eastern Conference.Congratulations again upon your ordination, and welcome to the Order. 344Lilith Sinclair had originally planned to come to Louisville with MichaelMcQuown, but pressingdemands in New York had forced her to cancel. The news was disappointing, as theMidwest Satanists -myself not the least - were all very curious to see this Compleat Witch who hadalmost single-handedlyformed a Grotto in New York City and who had now attained the Priesthood againvirtually withoutoutside guidance or sponsorship. After writing Shai, I sent Lilith a letter toencourage contact with him:Janet and I would like to take this occasion to tell you how very pleased wewere to hear of yourelevation to the Priesthood of Mendes by the High Priest. Your Grotto has indeedbeen a model for others tofollow, and you are more than deserving of the III°.We were both very sorry that you could not make it to the Louisville conference,as we have lookedforward for some time to a personal meeting. Nevertheless we certainlyunderstand the responsibilities youhave at home! Warlock McQuown did an excellent job of representing the Grotto,and I think that we arewell on the way to developing a firm interstate network in this region. 345Lilith replied that, if she couldn’t make it to an Eastern Conference inLouisville, then she would justhave to host the next one in New York City that fall. She and Shai begandiscussions on the matter almostimmediately, and the outcome was probably the single most spectacular regionalconference the Church ofSatan ever sponsored.At the Louisville Conference I had encouraged the delegates to continue theirdiscussions of Churchpolicies and programs with local members and groups upon their return, andGrumboski soon relayed theresults of an initial meeting with Belphegor to “Lana Green” at the CentralGrotto:Some random notes on Detroit’s feelings about the Church in general: With theCloven Hoof goingpublic, the membership feel at a loss for deeper information about the Church,its policies, and its magicalteachings. They are aware of the reasoning behind the decision to offer the Hoofto the general public. But,as they say, what’s the use of belonging to a secret society if there is no wayof passing information to thegeneral membership? If the Regional Agent newsletter resumes publication, ofcourse, it can be used to passinformation.Will the Church be increasing the size of its basic membership package? Most newmembers I meet aredissatisfied with the present package. When I discuss possible membership with anew individual, I neverpromise more than what the Church currently sends. I stress the fact that thisorganization acts as a clearinghouse for Satanic thought.We had a picnic last Sunday, and did I get feedback on the subject of raisingrenewal fees! Since theHoof became public, and with the possibility of adding $5 to the current $10fee, the members feel they are344 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, May 11, VII/1972.345 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lilith Sinclair, May 11, VII/1972.- 211 -not receiving full value for their cash outlay. They understand the additionalmonies would be put to gooduse, but like most folks they are concerned with all outgoing money in thistight market era.I am sure the new publication by Dr. LaVey will help uplift the members’ minds.[Note: Grumboski istalking about the Satanic Rituals - M.A.] But even there we have a problem.Since the book will go on thestands at bookstores, much of the Detroit membership will again feel that all ofour secrets are being givento the public for a very low price. Personally I have mixed feelings on thesubject. I want certain rites toremain secret to the Church alone, yet I want to spread Satanism to the generalpublic. It must be themissionary in me.We both know the Church is in dire need of funds. Is there a better way to raisemoney and still keepthe membership happy? I am very concerned about the Detroit grotto members -concerned enough towonder whether the charter will be renewed in July.346Shai sent me a copy of this letter with some additional comments. Should he tryto convince theBelphegorians to accept a situation they didn’t like, or was there something hecould do to alleviate thediscontent? I answered:If some or all of the Belphegorians should decide that their interests lieelsewhere, they are free todepart with our warmest wishes. Your immediate responsibility is not to persuadethem to stay, but rather toensure that they are aware of our sincere interest in them as individuals - yes!- and of our efforts to buildthe Church into a great institution with their help.It is necessary for our members to bear in mind that the Church of Satan is onlyseven years old.History’s significant institutions are built slowly. If we were to abandon ourstrict ethics and make a bid forsensationalism and commercialism a la Buckland, Martello, and Leek, we couldboom overnight. But thenwe would lose our most important quality - our authenticity.You may tell Doug Robbins for me that this is a sort of Valley Forge time forthe Church. We won’tthink the less of those who feel they have to leave, but we will remember thosewho stay. As for thefinancial argument, it doesn’t impress me. Even if we go to $15/year, you can’ttell me that there’s someonein Belphegor who can’t put aside $1.25/month in order to belong to our Activerolls!Furthermore we are at a point where the membership is beginning to receive avariety of materialbenefits from affiliation. The Cloven Hoof is being expanded and refined.Insignia and regalia ofprofessional quality are in the final review process. We have a functioningnetwork of Regional Agentsacross the country to work with members at large, and very soon we will have anationwide supervisorynetwork of Satanic Priests as well. All this will provide the active member withunlimited opportunities topractice and perfect his skill in the Black Arts. The mere subscriber to theHoof will find that all of theseorganizational avenues are denied him.As to the publication of the Satanic Rituals, it is not accurate to say thatthis lays bare our craft to theworld. Just because someone purchases a fine-quality dueling saber does not meanthat he can beconsidered a fencing master. Satanism is called the Black Art, not the BlackScience. There is a goodreason for this.Whatever finally happens in Belphegor, do not worry about it. Do the best youcan under thecircumstances and according to your best judgment. Remember that the magicianmust observe even themost seemingly tragic developments in long term perspective.There is a Will that oversees the future of the Church of Satan. In looking backover the past sevenyears of our Mandate, I cannot recall a single incident that ultimately did notact to our advantage. It tookme some time to realize this. There have been occasions when I thought that justabout everything wasgoing straight to Heaven, but invariably things worked themselves out. Youyourself ought to be able totestify to this.347346 Letter, Michael Grumboski to Lana Green, May 31, VII,1972.347 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, June 10, VII/1972.- 212 -As June of 1972 approached, I wondered whether the LaVeys were going to entrustDale Seago withthe Priesthood as well. To me he seemed quite capable, although I hadn’t seenhis III° examination results.I wrote Anton LaVey in early June to inquire on the matter, but before he couldanswer I received a letterfrom a surprised but delighted Seago reporting his receipt of a letter of III°authorization. 348At this time I also received the first indication of interest in a westernregional conference - fromWarlock Gerald T. Edwards, a Regional Agent in British Columbia, Canada:As a result of my correspondence with members in the western United States andCanada, it is evidentthat there is a desire for a Western Regional Conference during late VII orearly VIII. In order to begin theplanning for such a conference, it is necessary that all western Regional Agentscommunicate their opinionsin this regard. The provinces and states that should be included are BritishColumbia, Alberta,Saskatchewan, Washington, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, California, Nevada,Utah, Colorado,Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas. I would appreciatereceiving the opinions ofall Regional Agents in the above areas concerning their membership population,location for the conference,and facilities. 349I dutifully put Edwards’ announcement in the next issue of the Cloven Hoof, sentimmediate copies toAnton LaVey and Charles Steenbarger, and sent Edwards himself a long letterdetailing the east’sexperiences with its first two conferences. The idea of a similar series ofconferences in the west was verypromising - and was, I hoped, the first step towards an eventual nationalconference for the entire Churchmembership.In the second week of June the issue of Time containing the cover story on theoccult hit the stands.My tour at the Armor School had been tranquil enough, even if I had been theobject of local curiosityafter the periodic coverage of Nineveh’s activities in the Louisville Times andCourier-Journal.But when Time put a black-hooded Satanist on its cover and began its featurestory with an account ofour Walpurgis revels, the Army came unglued. I was identified not just as anofficer, but as the author ofan ROTC textbook - presumably directed towards the impressionable minds ofcollege students. Was thistrue? What horrors could have been concealed therein?I was called to account. Fortunately I was able to produce letters ofcommendation for the book inquestion from such personages as General William Westmoreland (then Army Chiefof Staff) and SenatorGeorge McGovern (then Democratic Presidential Candidate). The Army wassatisfied, and a short timelater General George S. Patton, son of “the” General Patton and AssistantCommandant of the ArmorSchool, named me a Distinguished Member of the Staff and Faculty. This wasfollowed by an ArmyCommendation Medal from General Desobry, the Commandant. Not to be outdone, myacademicdepartment presented me with a large, evil-looking Sikh knife in a red velvetscabbard - for sacrificingvirgins, I was told, if I could find any in California!The Time article covered a number of neo-pagan and even quasi-Christianmovements, but the Churchof Satan was clearly the focal point of both the text and the photo section. Thematerial concerning theChurch is reproduced as Appendix #54, while my review of the article in the nextissue of the Cloven Hooffollows as Appendix #55.On the 6th of June Diane LaVey, just returned from a Canadian trip with Anton,sent me an extensiveletter on a number of topics. It is reproduced here at length because itcontains so many key statements onpolicy matters:We have now been home for a week, and I have finally gotten it through my headthat I’m not really thePrincess on the Pea - we were really treated like royalty while in Canada - andthat there is work to be done.348 Letter, Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, June 12, VII/1972.349 Letter, Gerald Edwards to M.A. Aquino, June 12, VII/1972.- 213 -Actually most of the time since our return has been devoted to clearing up allthe odds and ends thatrequired immediate attention that came in the mail during our five day absence.That trip to Canada was really a shot in the arm for me. It was an exhilaratingexperience seeing, firsthand, the old LaVey magic in action. He really weaves a spell of enchantmentaround all those heencounters - from the most blasé media people to the most gung-ho Satanists, andeveryone in between.The effect of his charismatic personality and gentle charm is perhaps mostintriguing to observe in the verypositive response he receives from those prepared to dislike him.Judging by the wonderful receptions we received from everyone we met in bothEdmonton andVancouver, as well as the enthusiastic follow-up mail since our return, I wouldsay we have made somevery worthwhile contacts and gained many new friends.Besides Dale Seago, the following members have received their probationary III°authorization: JamesL. Stowe, Dolores V. Stowe, Margaret A. Wendall, Robert Ethel.Two others to add to the above list are Professor Wilm-Artur Meilen and JosephP. Hoff. These twogentlemen have been “commissioned”. The difference between this and“noncommissioned” Priests Ibelieve Anton discussed with you while you were here. They must, because oftheir professionalresponsibilities, operate on a semi-underground basis for now. I think he alsomentioned Hoff and Meilen toyou as examples of the sort of persons he had been considering for the“commissioned” III° status. Heneeded only the personal meeting - initial with Hoff and reunion with Meilen -before making his finaldecision. So we now have Priests of the caliber we prefer in Edmonton andVancouver who will beavailable for contact with “appropriate” members.I am enclosing a sample authorization, similar to those sent to Dale Seago, theStowes, etc. - not Hoff orMeilen, who received regular certificates - for your records.Dale Seago is obviously a winner; this, as you know, we have felt from the verybeginning. The Stowesand Margaret Wendall are responsible family people with a good understanding ofSatanism and a fairknowledge of related subjects, and they have shown themselves to be enthusiasticworkers for the cause.Robert Ethel turned in a fine test and has, through the several years he hasbeen a member, handled himselfin a decorous, ambitious manner - especially considering the sparsity of membersand opportunities he hashad at his disposal.Bill Meilen is, as you may already know, the head of the Drama Department of theUniversity ofAlberta, as well as being a professional writer, actor, and all-around goodpublic relations person. His booksDelta Two and KKK have gained him quite a reputation in both America and theBritish isles.J.P. Hoff is the controller for the largest film processing firm in Canada. Healso owns and operates aunique and highly successful restaurant - the Medieval Inn - in Vancouver, andis opening similarestablishments in Victoria and Montreal. Both Hoff and Meilen convey the perfectimage of the “SatanicGentleman” of the twentieth century.From the sublime to the ridiculous: I now offer the Master’s comments on Messrs.McQuown andBonewits:Isaac Bonewits: “A bright young man, but stridently boorish to aself-destructive degree. He came tome at age 19, expecting me to recognize him as a peer. Due to our 20-year agedifference, I hadaccumulated more knowledge, experience, abilities, and material benefits. HenceI did not recognize him ashe wished. He insisted. I told him to go away. Ever since then he has beenspinning his wheels in an attemptto defame and discredit me. That is the whole story of poor Isaac. Any successhe may attain in life will begoaded by his bitterness at my rejection - a phenomenon which is neitheruncommon nor unfamiliar to me,or to any successful person.”Michael McQuown: “McQuown is a shit disturber. He has the tact of the man whoapplies for a job, isturned down, and says to the interviewer: ‘I guess you’re cutting back on yourhiring because the firm ishaving financial difficulties, eh?’ He wants and expects the Church to give himposition and money. If wedo, he will employ it against us; his hobby is jousting for supremacy. If we donot, his frustration willjockey him into disruptive acts. He must be kept at arm’s length at all times.Van Ness has this problem to alesser degree, but it is easier contained. ‘Birds of a feather …’ Theirrespective occupational roles bear outmy analysis. No wise employer would tolerate McQuown for long.”The close personal relationship between Van Ness and McQuown doesn’t inspireconfidence in VanNess as a III° candidate, even if he were to resolve his own personality defects- which to some degree he- 214 -has already done. We would not feel confident in placing secret information inhis hands, as we arerelatively certain McQuown would also be made privy to such in short order.The higher application and renewal fees are still under consideration, thereason being that the decisionwill significantly affect other facets of Church policy and operation. There isstill some question in ourminds as to whether the $5 increase and subsequent funding of III° activitywould be the best plan. We arealso considering the more drastic move we have discussed with you and Jan -initially when you were inLouisville and again when you were here - of a $50 or $100 initial fee and a $25annual renewal fee. Inview of the squawks from the Belphegorians at the prospect of a mere $5increase, we have considered thatmaybe we ought to give them something to squawk about!I’ll give you the pro and con on each of these from our point of view. First the$5 increase: New peopleprobably wouldn’t be discouraged by the $30/$15 figure, and most of the presentmembership wouldn’t beput off by the slightly higher renewal rate, the Belphegorians notwithstanding.The additional $5 on eachnew membership would probably balance out to the same amount we were taking inon new membershipssix months ago, before we revised the form letter to discourage undesirableelements. And we would setaside the $5 on each membership or renewal to be used for III° reimbursements asyou have suggested.There wouldn’t be much change in the type of people who join, and the overallfinancial picture of theChurch would be about the same.The $50 initiation fee would probably reduce new memberships to at least half asmany as we nowreceive. A $100 fee would make them few and far between [I think … one neverknows]. The presentmembership might be satisfactorily purged of its “excess baggage”, and thenagain it might not. At leastwe’d have the additional $15 from those who stuck despite the boost.When you and Jan suggested this price raise, we were thinking along differentchannels than we arenow. It was partially altruism and partially pragmatism - or so we then thought.We thought it would beunfair to the good people who weren’t financially well fixed, and we alsothought we would get far fewernew members.Now we really don’t care about increasing the size of the membership, all thingsconsidered, and wecan always make exceptions in the rare instances we think warrant specialconsideration. But the rule (orrate) would be there to discourage the vampire element. It is true that thenumber of registered memberswould probably be reduced, but the movement (no strings attached) might justgrow even faster - forbiddenfruits (double entendre not intentional!), etc.Using this fee-rate we might wind up with enough income to still allow for theIII° fund, and we mightfind that the sort of person we might attract would be less inclined to expectreimbursement. If we chargedthese kinds of prices, though, we would have to spend a sizable amount ongood-quality stationery,brochures, etc. With the possibly smaller membership we could spend more time oninstruction andguidance to our key people.In discussing these two alternatives we came up with several unansweredquestions. Perhaps you canintroduce some thoughts to aid us in our decision. The higher fees wouldprobably curtail our plans toachieve a mass network of members and Regional Agents, since we would expectfewer registeredmembers. This would cut down the social aspect of the Church. But which isbetter: a vast organization ofsocial Satanists or a small network of Satanists who don’t need or want a sociallife within the Church ofSatan?It’s a difficult decision to make, because for every Lilith Sinclair, DaleSeago, or Mike Grumboski -whose value would be just as great, I believe, without the social element -there are 20 or more JohnDeHavens or Michael McQuowns - who would make a hasty exit if there were no onearound to observetheir antics.And most of our “sterling” Satanists either flatly refuse to become involvedwith other members -because they are a cut above the others or because they have to be careful abouttheir identities - or justhave no time for socializing outside of their present circles.The few who are willing to attempt forming a group begin to feel that they arefalling down on the jobif they don’t attract more than a few people. They are not the sort to pull anyold bum in off the street, andthey would feel foolish were they to beat the drum too loudly around theintelligent people they meet in thecourse of their jobs or among friends.- 215 -Occasionally we receive letters from higher caliber members apologizing becausethey haven’t gottenaround to contacting others. At the other extreme we have members who gripeabout everything - slowresponse to their mail, our “mercenary” attitude, the fact that the C/S must be“slipping” since they neversee Anton LaVey on teevee anymore … and there’s no Grotto to which they can go.Ironically it seems we continue to cater to those who expect the most from usfor the least from them,primarily because we have always wondered “what we’re going to give people inreturn for their $100”. Wehave queried 7-8 nonsocial members about this, and it appears they have beenwondering why we sellourselves so cheaply. And they seem to think we are unduly concerned with havingto give more in returnthan we do at present.Before summing up on this point I will discuss the III° fund, as its feasibilityand/or necessity should becontemplated within the aforementioned context. At the risk of sounding like acheapskate, I question whythe C/S should feel responsible for the expenditures of its III°s, who -hopefully - do whatever “goodworks” they do as a result of their dedication to the cause.If this is too nebulous an argument against a reimbursement policy, thenconsider this more practicalreason: Isn’t one of the requirements for the III° that a candidate have his ownhome or business orsomething of a tangible nature at stake to safeguard the Church’s “investment”in him? If so, then heprobably files an itemized IRS return, enabling him to claim church donationexpenses. If he has nothing toitemize, he wouldn’t - generally speaking - have much to lose. So if we make aconcession for him,accepting him on his merits as an individual, shouldn’t we expect him to coverexpenses by establishingsome sort of Church-related income (Grotto attendance fees, new membershipcommissions, personalenterprises bringing in funds for himself and the Church)?You clearly state that reimbursement would be for specific Church assignments,not for what III°s do ontheir own initiative. Such assignments would be relatively few. So we’re notthat concerned with actualmonetary outlay; it’s rather a matter of principle. I recall that you and Janthought this financial arrangementmight encourage more responsible types to aspire to the III°, presumably becausethey would feel they werebeing fairly compensated for their actual C/S expenses. I honestly think thatsuch people would do whateverthey could, with or without Church funding. Their greatest contributions wouldbe those on which no priceor value could be estimated!Individuals such as you and Jan, Chuck Steenbarger, Rev. Bentley, Dr. Vallee,and many others come tomind when we ask ourselves whether our best people need an expense account -regardless of size - as anincentive. You are a very rare exception in that you have superior intellect andability but have not yetobtained the financial rewards commensurate with your personal resources. Butyou are also very young tobe as wise and capable as you are, so you simply haven’t lived long enough toachieve the financial successyou are due. We trust the C/S will help to change that fact.Most individuals who meet the requirements we have set for the III° arenecessarily older and at least“comfortable” in their financial situation. Except for unforeseeable exceptions,I think this should be a hard,fast rule.In practically all other fraternal organizations, members buy their way intohigher degrees; onlyadministrative executives are paid. Why? Because they do work that the“potentates” won’t or can’t do. Inreligious organizations the potentate (priest or minister) has to work or losehis parish and the financialrewards from same. A missionary is subsidized by his church, it is true, but hiswork is usually a bit moregrueling than that of a III° in the Church of Satan.The only reasonable answer we can think of to the question of why people whoseemingly don’t reallyneed the C/S for social or financial opportunities support it in so many ways isthat they regard their part inthe movement with an attitude similar to Anton’s and mine, and to others such asJan’s and yours. Can it bethat, for the kind of people we prefer as members, it is enough to know “who youare, what you are, andwhat sort of movement you’re supporting”? If so, perhaps we’d better wake up tothe facts and stop tryingto realize some fantasized ideal insofar as our membership is concerned. What doyou think?350350 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 20, VII/1972.- 216 -The LaVeys’ attention had been drawn to Isaac Bonewits by virtue of his recentpublication of a bookentitled Real Magic, in which Bonewits not-so-subtly lashed out at Anton for histreatment of him while amember of the Church in its earliest San Francisco period. [See Chapter #20.]Bonewits went on to attain a certain dubious fame by becoming the first and onlyindividual tograduate from the University of California, Berkeley with a [tutorial] B.A. in“Magic” - and promptlyreproduced his diploma on the cover of his book, no doubt to the pleasure of theUniversity.McQuown apparently irked 6114 by asking me in a letter for details concerningAnton’s first marriage.In my answer to Diane I didn’t offer any detailed comments on the fees question,because I was rathermore concerned with her distinction between “overground” and “underground”Priests:You’ll have to excuse a bit of candor on my part, but I’m becoming less and lessimpressed with thearguments for “underground” status. The Church is sufficiently well establishedso that there is no mistakeabout its ethical posture. It has been my experience that those who fret theloudest about exposure of theiridentity are right up in the front ranks when it’s time for laurels. I don’t saythat Reverends Hoff and Meilenshould broadcast their new office, but I hope that their names may be cited inthe Hoof. It is not fair forsome Priests to walk the gauntlet of public opinion while others are excuseduntil it’s safe to come out. Thefact that someone is financially or professionally established in the communityshould be that much less of areason for secrecy - not more of one.I won’t press the point, particularly since it took me some time to realize thatI wouldn’t get tarred andfeathered once my Satanic office was known. Nevertheless the point has beenproven, and not one of ournew eastern III°s has requested “underground” status. Of course they expect tobe put on the spot, publiclyand privately, but their pride in the Church makes the risks worthwhile.Maybe I’m just an old-fashioned chauvinist, but I don’t think we need toapologize for the Church.There is nothing wrong with it. And the sooner we take a stand on this, thesooner it will be safe for you toremove the fence from in front of 6114. 351When this letter reached San Francisco, it provoked a carefully worded,courteous, yet unmistakablereproach from Anton. Apparently he had given this new “class system” of thePriesthood more than a littlethought - after the fashion, perhaps, of George Orwell’s Animal Farm: “Allanimals are equal, but someare more equal than others.” He wrote to me:I suppose some elucidation is in order concerning “underground” Priests. Nowthere are undergroundPriests and there are underground Priests. Both are hiding from exposure toundesirable persons orsituations.Our old-style Priest was inclined to be fearful of his neighbors or businessassociates lest his Satanicaffiliation diminish his popularity. That was when, because of insufficientknowledge of our true nature, onecould only - hopefully - find understanding and acceptance from other Satanists.That was also when Priestsand members could, with few exceptions, be shaken in the same bottle and not bedistinguished from oneanother.Sadly speaking, many Priests were nothing more than members with anoverabundance of ego-drive.Members gathered round the fanciest rooster, while the cock-of-the-walk baskedin his lodge-hall limelight.Such were the Wests, Greens, DeHavens, etc. The then-underground Priests had todetach themselves fromthe whole existing Priest/flock package, for it did little to help our image ortheirs.Those social groups (Grottos) held us together as a fleshly body, so thecombined “existence power” ofsaid member/Priests magically actualized our existence as an organized bodycalled the Church of Satan.Any furtherance of public understanding, acceptance, and intelligent inquiry didnot emerge from themachinations of our “social Satanists”, however.The then-underground Priests often were of the stuff of many of our presentfinest abovegroundmembers. On a rare occasion someone would appear who had all of the finestqualities, was willing to stickhis neck out, and successfully did. That is one of the main reasons why you’re aMagister.351 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, June 26, VII/1972.- 217 -Now for the dash of cold water that will explain the “why” of some of ourpresent underground Priests.No one can understand this better than you, Adrian, and myself, because we havedealt on a pastoral leveland learned things, through a worthwhile but often trying experiment, which wemight pass on to others -not by instruction but by omission. Think about all the problems you and Janhave had in your Priestlyroles. Did they come from military superiors, neighbors, the theater manager,the agency that sold you yourcar, or anyone else you might have let in on your affiliation? Hardly. They camefrom our own members.On the surface this is nothing new. All leaders’ problems arise from theenvironment over which theyreign, and are perpetrated by their minions. That, we must assume, is one of theresponsibilities ofleadership. We, however, grew out of a stigma, which you have amply proven toyourself - as well as toothers - need not be a stigma.Your point about pride in being a Satanist is well-taken. Capable, achievedSatanists indeed elicit astrange sort of respect from outsiders - a kind of unholy dread, in fact! Butagain it is not our social Satanistwho elicits this reaction, much as he likes to believe he does. It is your kindof Satanist whose creative andproductive energy, which might be properly applied, is diluted by having to playnursemaid. We havepersons with us who do not deserve to have to put up with the sort of thing wehave - the bickering, pettypower struggles, social embarrassments, threats, defamation, etc. Still, what wedid had to be done, for thereason explained earlier. We needed a body, a summary of personalities. And,believe me, I got by with asscant a body as possible.Now the kind of stuff we needed to create the “culture” (as in sourdough Frenchbread) can be relegatedto what we shall call the “Movement”, and the Church can wax crafty in themanner originally intended.Our social remnants can either (a) grow into “warrant officers” or (b) beretained under the jurisdiction ofpastoral (social function) Priests until they lose interest and leave to becomepart of the Movement. Thisincludes those who form their own “churches” out of lack of recognition orboredom.Our present underground Priests must be protected only from sponging members whomight place themin compromising straits. We have always had an underground comprised of thefinest humans on the planet.I want to have an overground made up of the same kind, and I will not settle forless. As always, theMovement must support the Will. The Church - the overground - has been firmlyestablished. We mustrefine it even more, but it will be done. And the Movement will sustain it forthis Age of Fire.Perhaps the present underground Priests would be better described as“semi-underground”. Ironically,while they make no secret of their affiliation around friends and associates,they must remain - at least forthe present - unknown to our lay membership. The obvious reason for this is thatthey can control the areasin which they admit their positions, but might find it difficult to undo thedamage that certain membersmight do in the same areas were they given the particulars on how they couldplace themselves on equalground with “their” Priests.I can understand your feeling miffed by this consideration on my part, but I amafraid I must stand firmon this matter. Any discomfort or exasperation you, Jan, and Adrian haveexperienced as a result of yourpast participation in the operations of the Church of Satan has only served tostrengthen my stubbornness. Iwas infuriated when I learned of an injustice to you, and each time I vowed todo whatever was necessary tominimize the chances of anything further happening. I am not so naïve as tothink that we’ll never again beburned, but at least I will not supply the matches. 352As much as Anton attempted to couch his decision in positive and flatteringterms, it was clear to methat a double standard was now being introduced into the Priesthood. And yet Iwas hardly in a position todispute Anton’s analysis of the rocky record of the “aboveground” Grotto system.All I had to go on was afeeling that the problems the Church had experienced were not the result of thatsystem per se, but ratherthe result of individuals’ misuse of that system through “their own triviallusts and perversions” 353 . Onedoes not smash a good instrument because untrained students play it badly, andthere had been manypositive features and recognizable successes in the Grotto system - more so thanthere were crises andfailures. It was one more case of the squeaky wheels getting the attention -and, it now seemed, the oil.352 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, typed date June 5 but probably July 5,VII/1972.353 Damien Thorn’s caustic comment on most people’s comprehension of “evil” inOmen III: The Final Conflict.- 218 -The solution, it seemed to me, lay not in creating a double standard - but inrefining the preexistingsingle standard to a suitable level of excellence. In a sense Anton and I wererepeating our “debate on theconcept of Church membership” [see Chapter #18], focusing now on the Priesthood.My conviction wasreinforced by reading the result of the last interview Janet and I had given inLouisville before ourdeparture, which appeared in the Courier-Journal and Times Magazine on July 9(Appendix #56).To Anton I now replied [with perhaps a touch of irony re Charles Steenbarger]:It is true that Jan and I have gone through some pretty tense moments because ofour offices in theChurch, and I’ve no doubt that Adrian has occasionally lost a bit of sleep aswell. But that was somethingwe accepted “freely and of our own will” when we accepted initiation into theOrder of the Trapezoid. Wehave no regrets whatever, and we’d do it all over again at a moment’s notice.The Priesthood of Mendes isnot a burden; it is a privilege.My feeling in this instance is simply that it is time for you and Diane to stopbearing the brunt of thecriticism against the Church. You have both put up with too much, and the Orderwould do well to showsome indignation at this.At the Second Eastern Regional Conference I had a long talk with Grumboski aboutthis, and I haveexpressed similar views to Seago as well. The substance of my advice was that(a) the Church will bepublicly regarded as a “questionable” organization indefinitely unless the Ordertakes a firm stand to thecontrary, (b) that a Satanic Priest should accept his office with theunderstanding that the ride will be arough one, and (c) that one should not expect Anton LaVey to “carry the cross”alone. Both of them agreed.What I am against, as I mentioned to Diane, is the prevailing attitude - albeitunspoken - that there issomething “wrong” with the Church of Satan. It is evident among many members,who display an obviousself-consciousness when questioned about the organization. As long as ourmembers possess such anattitude, we are fighting uphill.I feel very strongly that our members - and particularly our officials - shouldactively radiate personalpride in their affiliation. And, if you’ll permit a little PSYOP technique,there is a second consideration aswell. Those whose “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor” are committed on behalf ofan ideal have a stronginterest in making that ideal succeed - because, if it doesn’t, they’ll go tothe block. If a person enters a frayon condition that he’ll lose nothing in the event of failure, his motivationcan’t help but be a little moreacademic.My feeling is that there will eventually be friction between overground andunderground Priests in theChurch. If I did not tell you this, I would be remiss in my obligations to you.The announced Priest willlook at his clandestine brother and think: “So he’s too ‘important’ to dirty hisfeet with the rest of us?” Suchan undercurrent can result in the loss of both overground Priests (who thinkthey are being “used”) andunderground Priests (who may be the victim of undue bitterness). Having saidthis, I will remain silent onthe entire matter unless called upon by you personally. 354I was uncomfortable at having to disagree with Anton LaVey so pointedly on amatter of policy, sinceto date he and I had never had the mildest of arguments. A good subordinate, Ifelt, should give honestopinions to his superior and then seek to implement the ultimate decision in themost constructive waypossible. If Hoff, Meilen, and Vallee were worthy of the title of SatanicPriest, I reasoned, then waterwould seek its own level and their contributions would ultimately becomeevident. That very developmentwould cause them to acknowledge, then publicly champion their Priesthood -thereby transforming themautomatically to “overground” clergy.If they were not so worthy, then they would fade out of the Church altogether,probably without themembership’s ever becoming aware of their Priesthood at all. Again water wouldseek its own level, andin this case it seemed that they would cause no harm. And that is what happened,since the organizationnever heard anything more from them.354 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, July 10, VII/1972.- 219 -While Messrs. Hoff and Meilen were enjoying their comfortable, elite status upin Canada, Dale Seagowas approaching his “probationary” Priesthood in North Carolina with firmdetermination. In June hewrote me:Less than a month in the Priesthood and already problems I’m having: I began mypromotionalcampaign last week. There are only three cities in this immediate area -Havelock, New Bern, andMorehead City. Each has a single city newspaper. Neatly dressed in coat and tie,I went to the office of eachpaper to place an advertisement for the Church.The Havelock Progress accepted it with some reluctance. Then, when it firstappeared on June 22,“church” was misspelled. I got on to them the next day. They apologized and willreprint the ad, corrected,an additional week at their expense.I was more or less thrown out of the office of the New Bern Sun Journal, whichflatly refused to printthe ad. With an incredible effort of will I managed to refrain from smashingskulls, and remained civil andformally polite. The Sun Journal is a privately owned paper, and there wasnothing I could do about thesituation.The Carteret County News-Times was a surprise. I walked in, told them what Iwanted, paid up - andthey never batted an eyelash or asked a question, as though it were an everydayoccurrence.Then today I received a letter from the News-Times advertising manager [refusingthe ad]. If I cannot somuch as let people outside Havelock know of my presence here, the scope of myactivities is apt to be verylimited indeed. I want very much to promote the Church here, but I refuse tostoop to passing out handbillsin the streets.This situation angers me beyond words. I hope something can be done about it.However, I will dowhatever you and the personnel at Central Grotto decide is best. 355My reply was written as much for the LaVeys (who received “blind” copies of allChurch letterswritten by me for the duration of Anton’s High Priesthood) as for Seago himself:As you know, I feel that our Priests and Priestesses should display a strongconfidence and personalpride in their office. The Church has established its reputation and integrity;there is simply no reason for usto “hide under the bed” any longer. To do so, as a matter of fact, wouldactively harm us, as people wouldthink we really do have something noxious to conceal under our advertisedexterior.On the other hand one must recognize that prejudice against the Church willstill be encountered. Andwe do not want public gaze so centered upon the Priesthood that we cannot take asingle step withoutconsulting a public relations man.What it boils down to is this: You determine the extent to which your clericaloffice is known. Do notallow yourself to be plagued by reporters, critics, and “researchers” of theoccult. Simply refer them to theSatanic Bible and then invite them to write San Francisco if they wishadditional information. The CentralGrotto will refer them to you if it wishes further information made available atthe regional level. 356The first of the “digest” issues of the Cloven Hoof appeared in July-August1972. There were seven ofthese issues over the next 14 months, each about 25-30 pages in length andstaple-bound between black,red, or yellow covers emblazoned with a single cloven hoofprint. They took moreof my research, writing,and typing time than any other Hoofs before or since, but their general qualityjustified the effort.From the first “digest” issue (July-August 1972) I have reprinted as Appendix#57 an article on H.P.Lovecraft’s mythical (?) city of R’lyeh, in which I had become interested duringresearch for the “Call toCthulhu” in the forthcoming Satanic Rituals. In a new article on the SatanicPriesthood (Appendix #58), Imentioned the “underground” Priesthood as discretely as possible; and in anarticle on the subject ofsecrecy (Appendix #59), I tried as obliquely as possible to suggest to the Hoffsand Meilens of the Church355 Letter, Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, June 26, VII/1972.356 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Dale Seago, July 19, VII/1972.- 220 -of Satan that it was members’ willingness to stand up and be counted that wouldultimately spell publicacceptance or ostracism for the Church.Anton’s own essay for the first “digest” Hoof was entitled “Application ofSpeech in Lesser Magic”.He advised Satanists to attune their speech patterns and mannerisms to thosewhom they would impress ormanipulate - a novel application of “sympathetic” magic. He further recommendedaffecting a differencein speech when confronting a repulsive figure before an audience, or whenseeking to alienate orantagonize an individual. It is important, he said, to be subtle in suchtechniques so that the opponent and/or audience does not become aware of the magical operation. He concluded:Lest this brief treatise be interpreted as a pointer on how to be a “yes man”,such is not the case. A “yesman” says what he thinks his listener wants to hear. The problem is that heusually thinks wrong. Amagician is a “yes man”, but of a different sort. He knows when to disagree,recognizing his subject’s cueswhich indicate a desire to be contradicted.Conversely an incompetent magician might manage to say what his subject wants tohear, but in aspeech pattern which is antagonistic to his subject.One can get by on the old saw: “It’s not what you say but how you say it.” Butto excel at enchantmentthe rule must be modified to: “It’s what you say and how you say it.” Even themost confirmed masochistwill find greater enjoyment in being browbeaten if you employ his cherishedideal of speech while attackinghim.The voice is a musical instrument that must be well-tuned, and each verbalinteraction a duet. 357357 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof #IV-6, July-August VII/1972.[index-221_1.jpg]- 221 -The Devil is believed in and worshipped by a few small, obscure groups in Europeand NorthAmerica. The best known of them is the Church of Satan, with its headquarters inSan Francisco. Foundedin 1966, it attracted excited attention by celebrating Satanist weddings,baptisms, and funerals in public,and was estimated in 1972 to have more than 9,000 members in the U.S.A. andabroad.Richard CavendishThe Powers of Evil (1975)* * *“Rege Satanas!” Cagliostro called. “Rege Satanas!” the gathered flock echoed.“Ave Satanas!” “AveSatanas!” “Satan rules the Earth!” “Satan rules the Earth!”Cagliostro then lifted a long, pointed sword from the top of the black-marblealtar. Moving itclockwise, he pointed to the north, east, south, and west. He stopped at eachcardinal point of the compass,saying: “O mighty Prince of Hell. Leviathan from the north, Satan from the east,Belial from the south,Leviathan from the west. We call unto you, O high and noble Lord of Darkness. Weare here, and we awaityour coming.”Lynn BenedictThe Lucifer Cult (Gothic novel) (1974)* * *Anton spreads the faith from his black San Francisco Victorian house on quietCalifornia Street, justsouth of the Golden Gate Bridge. The interior is a masterpiece of pop occultdecor, a Disneyfied CharlesAddams setting that’s exactly what you would imagine as a sorcerer’s lair. Thewalls are black and thelightbulbs red; each room has some of LaVey’s cheerfully ghoulish paintings;there’s a deformed skeletonand stuffed animals peering out of unlikely corners; even the bathroom has blacktowels and black toiletpaper. Drinks are served with Marquis de Sade napkins on a marble gravestonecoffee table made byAnton’s wife and high priestess, Diane, a cuddly-cute blonde who bustles aboutthe premises as if she hadjust stepped out of a sexy-housewife TV commercial.Nat FreedlandThe Occult Explosion (1972)* * *At all events, de Castries had acquired a lot of dark, satanic charm fromsomewhere by the time hearrived at the City by the Golden Gate. He was, I’d guess, quite a bit like theSatanist Anton LaVey (whokept a more-or-less tame lion for a while, did you know?)Fritz LeiberOur Lady of Darkness (1977 )- 222 -LaVey’s 400-pound lion was finally donated to the San Francisco Zoo afterneighbors complained thatit was “on dope” and “roared all night”. I should have thought these allegationsto have been incompatiblewith one another. Perhaps, however, LaVey was trying to wean the animal fromdrug addiction, and itsroars were symptomatic of its withdrawal from its “hooked” state.Francis KingSexuality, Magic and Perversion (1971 )* * *Here in the San Francisco Bay Area an ex-circus odd-jobber jumped on the occultbandwagon andcame close to making a fortune. Knowing just enough about occultism to impressthe ignorant, heplagiarized Nietzsche and Hitler to put together a philosophy that appealed tofascists countrywide … Thisman soon had members of the KKK, the American Nazi Party, local policedepartments, the Mafia, andordinary socialites and jet-setters in search of a new thrill all flocking tohis meetings. Those withoutmoney or influence never got through the front door. How did I infiltrate, then?That’s another story.This man had a rather monotonous repertoire of six or seven routines heperformed weekly. Theseincluded prayers to Satan for blessings on the members, “incantations” of puregibberish, ceremoniesstolen from the Masons, the wearing of black KKK sheets, and a nude woman for analtar.Corny as he was, the rubes ate it up. He had absolutely no magical powers of hisown; all he had wasan incredible amount of charisma and pure chutzpah. But then again, there werefascinating deals going onbehind his closed doors (in his “Inner Circle”), and his knowledge of theprivate lives of San Francisco’swealthiest and most powerful families gave him tremendous opportunities forextortion and blackmail.P.E. Isaac BonewitsReal Magic (1971 )* * *This one [Bonewits] I remember well. He was the perfect example of one who hasan enormously highI.Q. (potential) coupled with a total lack of common sense (actuality). He spentseveral months standingon a corner in Berkeley with a bullhorn, given to him by a member of the Church,in the attempt to gainnew members to LaVey-ism. He failed; he brought in none.Contrary to popular opinion, Anton LaVey had a great deal of patience, and atlong last it was taxed tothe fullest. On one memorable evening Anton at long last lost his cool and wasobliged to throw him out.If his most devout followers could have seen the way that he crawled, and I meanliterally, upon his handsand knees and cried like a baby before he was finally dumped into the streetfrom whence he came, theywould thoroughly understand his hatred for his one-time Coven Master … He didnot “infiltrate” as hasbeen alleged, but came willingly - and noisily - to most of our activities. Buteven so, I do not begrudgeI.B. his anger. He was not mature enough at the time to realize what was goingon, and like a child wouldthrow what amounted to a temper tantrum when things weren’t going his way. Allthat it took was a heavyhand to place him on the proper Path. Let us all hope that he remains there.“Eric Zann” of San FranciscoLetter, Earth Religion News (1974 )* * *Applicants for membership are advised to read the Satanic Bible, and if theyfind they are in accordwith its principles, they are asked to submit an application. The initiation feefor various levels ofmembership runs anywhere from $20 to $500, with the lower amount usually paid byfirst-level membersoutside the San Francisco Bay Area.“Jean Molina” in Martin Ebon (Ed.)Witchcraft Today (1971 )- 223 -On Friday, Playland at the Beach (San Francisco’s amusement park) closed and theopera opened;how’s that for symmetry? My first exclusive is that the hitherto unidentifiedpurchaser of Playland’sfamous old merry-go-round, sold at auction, is Edna Beard, a large black womanwhose lawyer is WillieBrown, Jr… The only other bidder of interest at Playland was Anton LaVey, theSatanic priest, so-called,who acquired, for $20, a box of leather whips and chains. Wouldn’t you know?Herb CaenSan Francisco Chronicle (1973 )* * *The self-styled high priest of the International Church of Satan, Anton S.LaVey, advocates anessentially fascist state in which the weak would be weeded out. [See DonaldNugent, “Satan is a Fascist”,The Month, April 1972.]Jean-Michel AngebertThe Occult and the Third Reich (1974 )* * *Today the main group practicing sexual magic in the U.S.A. is a small, secretinner circle within whatis usually regarded as an excessively publicity-conscious and rather “kookie”organization - the SanFrancisco-based Church of Satan … There has always survived the tradition thatthere is a hidden side tosexuality, an esoteric knowledge capable of transforming the orgasm into asupernatural rite by which thehuman mind is enabled to experience hitherto unknown modes of consciousness.Some variant of thisancient doctrine is taught to the members of the secret inner circle of theSatanic Church to which I havepreviously referred. It forms no part of the Church of Satan’s public teachingson sexuality, for these arecrudely hedonistic, bearing more resemblance to the philosophy of the proprietorof a strip-joint than theydo to the subtle intellectual systems of Reuss and Crowley.Francis KingSexuality, Magic and Perversion (1971 )* * *Like the more respectable forms of this ancient art, Satanic magic is based onthe theory that desiresmay be achieved through an act of will, provided it is properly directed throughmental imagery and firedby heightened emotion … There are certain statements in the Satanic Bible worthquoting for the lightthey may throw on our present thesis: “This discharge of bioelectrical energy isthe very samephenomenon which occurs during any profound heightening of the emotions, suchas: sexual orgasm,blind anger …” And again: “Despite all nonverbalists’ protests to the contrary,soaring heights ofemotional energy or raging pangs of anguish can be attained through verbalcommunication.”Is the “bioelectrical energy” of the Satanists the same bioplasmic energy of thescientists and the“animal magnetism” of the Mesmerists? Almost certainly it is. LaVey’sinstructions on how to discharge itare an example of perfectly orthodox occultism. From time immemorial, initiateshave taught that aprofound heightening of the emotions is necessary to do the trick.J.H. BrennanThe Occult Reich (1974 )* * *Anton Szandor LaVey and his “Church of Satan” are just another manifestation ofthe Californiadream turning sour. He is perhaps better established and more organized than somany of the drug-takingcults of the state, and with his increasing membership a long future seemsfairly safe to predict. Doubtlesstoo his antagonism towards the practitioners of white witchcraft is going toincrease as surely as theirs willtowards him. Whether either side accepts the fact, both are playing withdangerous powers they may notalways be able to control. Should that happen, the dangers could be real for allof us.Peter HainingThe Anatomy of Witchcraft (1972 )- 224 -LaVey shaves his head and affects a beard and mustache indicative of Lucifer. Heis tall, commanding,fluent, and, heaven help me, convincing … LaVey talked in chummy fashion of theevil eye and humanvampires and a variety of other eerie personalities. He was vastly entertaining,wonderfully eloquent,amazingly knowledgeable in theology, history, and human behaviorism. He alsomentioned another bookhe has written. About Satanism, naturally.So mesmeric were LaVey’s voice and demeanor that I found myself surreptitiouslypeering at his feetto determine if one of those pedal extremities weren’t actually a cloven hoof.We all know that, whenSatan adopts human form, he can’t get rid of one cloven hoof. Both of LaVey’sfeet seemed normal. Hehas rather big feet. But then he is a big man.The wax effigy of LaVey is an admirable piece of work. He is shown standing overthe supine figure ofa nubile young woman. His image, explained Ron Fong of the wharf museum, wasfour months in themaking. The likeness is perfect. No horns either.Nothing in the magical world of journalism surprises me any more.Alan WardOakland Tribune (1972)[index-225_1.jpg]- 225 -It did not take the Lilith Grotto long to begin planning for the next EasternConference - the firstregional activity scheduled for the East Coast:Meeting Report - Lilith Grotto - by Priestess Lilith SinclairThe Lilith Grotto met as usual on July 15, VII at 9:00 PM. There was a review ofour financial status,followed by a discussion on how we could increase our income, and variousmembers offered suggestionssuch as lectures, seminars, etc. We are already registered with various localcolleges, libraries, and otherorganizations as being available for speaking engagements. I’m still gettingquite a bit of interestedresponse and inquiries from the Time article.Plans for the Third Eastern Regional Conference were tentatively outlined, andMike McQuown ishelping me check out various possible sites. Ideally we would like a good hotelwhere we can combine thebanquet and conference ritual with accommodations for those members who wish tostay overnight, but Iam waiting for a reply from Reverend Grumboski on this idea.Magister Aquino has been a great help in giving us assistance on what to do, howto go about makingarrangements, etc., and we are grateful since neither Shai nor I have everorganized anything of this sort. Iwill keep the Central Grotto posted on developments.Among those present was William Butch, my brother. He is visiting for the summerand is mostinterested in the occult - particularly Egyptian lore and the Cult of Set. Heworks alone rather than with agroup, but he enjoys discussing various aspects of the occult with us and isknowledgeable in his field. 358The site chosen by the Grotto was New York City’s Statler Hilton hotel. Therewere no complications;management professed itself delighted to host the Church of Satan, and programplanning began.Just before leaving Kentucky in June I had initiated some correspondenceconcerning the Church’smedallion problem. In its formative period during the late 1960s, the Church wasable to have Baphometmedallions handmade by artists affiliated with the Central Grotto. When donecarefully, these fired-enamelon copper medallions were both beautiful and magically evocative.But as time passed and the Church membership expanded, the ensuring ofpromptness and qualitycontrol became increasingly more of a problem. By 1971 the LaVeys decided totake a chance on acommercially-made paint/metal Baphomet, but the result was hardly impressive.I offered to contact some first-rate insignia companies to see if a trulyacceptable medallion could beproduced. All but one of the big insignia firms declined to reply; presumablythey were shy of doingbusiness with such a frightening customer as the Church of Satan. The firm whichdid reply was Wolf-Brown, Inc. - manufacturer of insignia for the U.S. armed forces and for manycivic and fraternalorganizations as well. The letter reached 6114 in July of 1972:358 Sinclair, Lilith, Lilith Grotto Report, July 15, VII/1972.- 226 -Thank you for the privilege of quoting on your pendant medallions and lapelpins, received through ourSan Francisco office. Please contact the undersigned with any further questions.We look forward toservicing your requirements.Robert H. Moffatt, DirectorCustom Products Division, Wolf-Brown, Inc. 359The LaVeys waited awhile to see if further responses were forthcoming, then sentthe Wolf-Brownletter to me in Santa Barbara in late August. I responded:Thank you very much for your letters concerning the production of distinctiveinsignia for the Churchof Satan. Of the many bids we have received to date, yours has been the mostreasonable, and this - togetherwith your firm’s most excellent reputation for craftsmanship - made the decisionfor us. We hope toestablish a long and profitable relationship with you. 360An order was placed for Baphomet medallions in chromium-plated metal andfire-enamel,manufactured in Taiwan to Wolf-Brown’s specifications. The first order (for II°and III° medallions) wasso beautiful in appearance that a subsequent order for a full range ofmedallions was placed. At the sametime colors for all degrees were finalized: I° = red, II° = white, III° = black,IV° = royal blue, and V° =royal purple. This color scheme remained until June 1975.Robert H. Moffatt had become something of a celebrity around Wolf-Brown for hiswillingness tonegotiate and process orders from organizations that made everyone else jittery.Thus it was that the KuKlux Klan received beautiful insignia, and thus also did the Church of Satanfinally obtain its strikingBaphomet medallions.Moffatt was personally unassociated with both organizations, but he wasinterested enough in theChurch of Satan to observe its progress from a distance. Following the 1975crisis he decided to enter theTemple of Set, wherein he eventually became a member of the Council of Nine anda Magister Templi IV°. His wife Constance also entered the Temple, attaining the IV° and a Councilseat as well.In Detroit, Michael Grumboski had made contact with Lilith Sinclair and DaleSeago, and by Augusthe and Seago struck up a provocative correspondence on Satanic metaphysics. Fromone of Shai’s letters:The concept of a “Kirlian” energy body has been around for a hell of a longtime. Agreed, it hasn’t beenexamined as a physical substance, but rather as a spiritual one ( Ka, Ba, soul,etc.). You raised the questionthat if demons do exist, we have created them by our own powers. Also, if thesoul exists, it too could havebeen created by the mind. There is far too little known about the how and why ofenergy.I do concur with your ideas of limiting god-powers. I follow the idea of bothgood and evil (damnlabels!) being merged into a single power structure. By the rites of magic weplug into this source andconnect it with the emotion we desire. At the same time we connect it with thethought-lines of the peoplewe wish to change by the ritual, thereby setting up a complete circuit. The ideaof a key involves opening adoor to give us entry into another dimension; our key is ritual.The desire to live even after death is not the only instrument needed forsurvival, or we would havemore cases of ghosts and hauntings - if the undead use the Earth for theirplayground. I do know some ofthe powers of suggestion; I’ve used light trances to help alleviate friends’headaches countless times. I haveused self-hypnosis to assist in projection, but I haven’t been as successful asI would like.We - you, I, and most if not all people who advance beyond the II° - are in aconstant state of change.As you mention, we are dropping old beliefs only to pick them up again - quitechanged, I grant, in theirbasic principles. What is the ultimate end? Will it be just a large cone ofpower for members’ use? Orperhaps the individual will become so elevated that he will no longer needmagic; he will be magic!359 Letter, Robert Moffatt to Church of Satan, July 21, VII/1972.360 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Robert Moffatt, September 2, VII/1972.- 227 -The central idea of the Church has been to raise the member to his godhead. Butthe Church doesn’tmake it easy; the member must strive towards that level himself. No one cangrant us power without ourown work. IV°? Hell, I’m still having trouble just keeping up with the III°!Granted that if promotions docome with seniority it would be an honor. But the Church, as it has acted in thepast, doesn’t give outdegrees just because you’re an oldster. There was a reason for your, Lilith’sand my ordination - a damngood one, I’m sure. The only IV° I know personally is Michael Aquino, and I’d behappy to see him kickedup to Magister Templi. He is one in a million, work- and personality-wise.In several papers and letters Magister Aquino has mentioned an Intelligence. Iagree with the concept ofone prime source for all magical, creative, and destructive work - and perhaps asource for all unwrittenrecords of life. We know that energy cannot be destroyed - only changed intoanother form. If we take abattery and connect it to another battery, we increase the power output. If wetake a mind and connect it toanother mind, we have similarly connected wires. To put it differently, everyoneand every power are ofone. I did not know you until we met in Kentucky. By the act of meeting weestablished a physical link withone another. We can create a link by thought control, as magicians achieve inritual. There are not manyforms of people or gods; there is but one person and one god, and they are thesame. But as in life only thestrong survive, so too can this one person/god be altered.361Simultaneously, in an effort to inject new life into the midwest membership,Grumboski began alively, irreverent newsletter entitled Changes IV. No one (including me) knewwhat the title meant, andeveryone (including me) didn’t want to appear ignorant by asking the editor toexplain it. Shai is probablythe only one who knows what Changes IV meant, but we are all entitled to ourYANKEE ROSEs …Dale Seago was approaching the expiration of his Marine Corps enlistment. He hadhad enough of theCorps’ restrictive atmosphere and had decided to return to Colorado as acivilian. I mentioned this toCharles Steenbarger, thinking that Seago’s personal leadership andaggressiveness might complementChuck’s undeniable expertise but reluctance to become actively involved with thepublic. Steenbargerreplied to me:Your reference to Reverend Seago’s eventual arrival in Denver raises thequestion of his official rolehere, since we have two Grotto Leaders already. Hopefully we could work out anarrangement whereby hecould actively supervise these two leaders while starting another group himselfand/or assisting me in theexecution of regional tasks.As you may know, in order to reduce dependency on me and in the interest oftheir more independentgrowth, I resigned as their Agent, leaving them to their own devices andinitiative. Currently I act only in anadvisory manner and have contact with their leaders only on an as-needed basis.Of course they understandmy role could become highly directive as a Church official during emergentsituations and at the discretionof the High Priest.Reverend Seago could thus become a valuable associate by providing our localGrottos with morefrequent contacts. Since the Queen City is in the heart of the western complex,it would also be of greatvalue to me to have a Priest assistant in order to ease the future work involvedin setting up and operating aregional organization. 362As a result of his dialogue with Michael Grumboski, Seago had decided to followup his “A.Billington” letter to the Cloven Hoof with a necromantic ritual in the spirit ofH.P. Lovecraft (Appendix#60). This so intrigued me that, when casting about for a lead article for theSeptember-October Hoof, Idecided to research the probability for HPL’s cosmological concepts. I wasfavorably impressed - and nota little surprised - at what I discovered. The result was the article “GenesisII” (Appendix #61). PriestessMargaret Wendall of San Jose thought about it, then wrote to Dale Seago:361 Letter, Michael Grumboski to Dale Seago, August 21, VII/1972.362 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to M.A. Aquino, September 7, VII/1972.- 228 -Have you gotten the latest Hoof? I’ve read and reread the article on theevolution of the universe, andI’ve got questions. In my experience Order has never come out of Chaos. If ourapartment looks like Chaos,I have to put it into Order. The same with my desk or typesetting while I wasworking.The question I have is: Is this “Intelligence” we’ve been writing back and forthabout responsible forthe change from Stage One to Stage Two, and so on? I kind of think so, but wouldnever admit this openly.Some Christian would pop right up and say: “Aha! You do believe in God.” Whichof course is wrong,because their idea of godness isn’t intelligent, much less being “Intelligence”.My dad, who’s an astronomer, says the “continuous evolution” theory makes moresense to him thanone spontaneous creation some millions of years ago. All one has to do is lookat the universe, and one cansee that stars are continually being born and are constantly dying, even thoughit doesn’t happenovernight. 363Additional articles of mine in the September-October issue included “Satanism inPerspective” (Appendix #62) and a brief treatment of the Illuminati (Appendix#63). In the same issue ofthe Hoof Anton LaVey offered Satanists advice on “Music for the Ritual Chamber”.Favored music, hesuggested, should be set aside and used only for appropriate ritual occasions sothat its effect might not bedulled through familiarity. He divided ceremonial music into two categories -magical (impacting theconsciousness) and mystical (creating a subconscious atmosphere). Finally hecited his own favoriteclassical works as follows:Gothic/Satanic Mass:- Mussorgsky, “The Great Gate at Kiev”- Organ works of Bach, Coupein, Vidor,from Pictures at an ExhibitionFranck, Palestrina- Strauss, Also Sprach Zarathustra- Faure, Requiem and PavannePower, Compassion, and Sacred LoveLess traditional, yet solemn:- Handel, Largo from Xerxes- Beethoven, 2nd Movement,- Gounod, “Trio and Apotheosis” from FaustEroica (7th) Symphony- Verdi, “Va Pensiero” from Nabucco- Tchaikovsky, 2nd Movement, 4th Symphony- von Flotow, overture to Martha- Berlioz, Funeral and Triumphant Symphony- Sibelius, FinlandiaPower:- Tchaikowsky, theme of the black swan- Gomez, overture to Il Guaranyfrom Swan Lake,- Puccini, end of first act of Turandotoverture to Romeo and Juliet- Wagner, overture to Tannhaüser- Wagner, “Liebestod” from Tristan and Isolde“Magic Fire Music”- Callejo-Barrera, “Granadinas” from Emigrantes“Ride of the Valkyries”Sensual:- Lalo, finale from Le Roi d’Ys- Ravel, Bolero- Kodaly, “Napoleon Bevonulása”- Orff, Carmina Buranafrom Háry János- Saint-Saens, “Bacchanale” fromSamson and Dalalia364After completing the “Genesis II” Hoof, I flew to New York City for threemonths’ work with MerrillLynch at its Wall Street headquarters. I did not immediately contact the LilithGrotto. Had I done so, Iwould have learned that it was once more in the public eye - and once morebecause of “occult murder”activities unconnected with the Grotto [see Appendix #64].Rather than attend the Third Eastern Conference myself, I thought I might plan aspecial advanceactivity for the Priesthood and then stand back while Lilith Sinclair andMichael Grumboski ran theConference itself. Since Grumboski was scheduled to ceremonially ordain Sinclairand Seago at theConference, and since no officially standardized ordination ceremony yet existedfor the Church of Satan,363 Letter, Margaret Wendall to Dale Seago, October 10, VII/1972.364 LaVey, Anton, “Music for the Ritual Chamber” in Cloven Hoof,September-October VII/1972.- 229 -I wrote one (Appendix #65) and sent it to San Francisco for the LaVeys’ review.A few days beforeHalloween, Diane LaVey sent word of their approval: “We have received the ritualyou composed for useat the conference. The Master said to tell you it is beautiful and exquisitelyrendered. It will be retainedand used for future appropriate ceremonies.”While nosing around Manhattan I had come across an advertisement for anairline-sponsored tour ofDracula’s castle & surrounding haunts in Transylvania. I sent the brochure toSan Francisco, and nowDiane commented on it:Interesting that you should send the brochure on the tour of Transylvaniaconducted by ProfessorsMcNally and Florescu. When we first heard about it [earlier this year when itwas being planned], I thoughtabout trying to promote a trip for Anton on the premise that his name as one ofthe passengers might be anadditional drawing-card for prospective customers.Just a week before the brochure you sent arrived, he gave an informal talk tosome of the C.G. staff onvampires in general and his own “classic case” in particular.I think he has mentioned that case to you, but I don’t know in how much detail.It’s the one where theman (“vampire”) finally blew himself up making flash powder. He has three fatfile folders on the case -everything from the fellow’s birth certificate and school report cards tocountless photos, police and coronerreports, and a couple of shrunken cats’ heads [and the instructions whereby heshrunk them!].I’ve tried to talk him into writing a novel based on fact, since he couldn’t doit as nonfiction with theman’s mother still living. I think it would be a perfect vehicle for his firsttry at fiction, as a fantasticallycompelling yarn could be woven from the material (factual oddities) he has onhis “vampire”. And I’ve seena few samplings of his talent for fiction; in my estimation he just might be abetter fiction than nonfictionwriter. Someday …365While back in Kentucky I had read Lilith Sinclair’s report concerning RaymondBuckland’s WitchcraftMuseum on Long Island. Now that I was in the neighborhood, I couldn’t resistseeing the place formyself. In the November-December Cloven Hoof I recounted the results of myvisit:Bay Shore is a most pleasant little town, having a winding main street andresidential arteries with anabundance of greenery and careful landscaping. By contrast the famous BucklandMuseum was an uttershock. At 6 First Avenue is a rickety, 2-1/2 story house with a gigantic signbearing the museum’s namehanging from the porch. Half the shingles were absent from the roof, and theyard was heaped with rubbish.The front lawn was extraordinarily ragged, and most of the grass was yellow fromwater-starvation - a sorrycommentary concerning the “nature loving” Wiccans. A frustrated Mail PouchTobacco artist had inscribedMUSEUM on the porch roof for the edification of any passing pigeons.A sign on the front door solemnly warned visitors that the museum was seriousbusiness and should notbe regarded as a “fun house”. It was well that this was made clear, else weshould have been misled by thesouvenir counters, trinkets, and campaign buttons saying “I DID A ‘SPELL’ AT THEBUCKLANDMUSEUM”. We refrained from buying one, as Dr. Buckland was inventorying them atthe time of our visit.As a matter of fact we did enjoy some of the exhibits - particularly thosedealing with Latin Americanpaganism, African ritualism, and antiquarian artifacts. The G.I. Joe dolls inInquisitorial dress didn’t domuch for us, but that could have been a matter of taste. Offense to theintellect commenced with exhibitsimplying a cohesion to “Wicca” practices since prehistoric times, an assertionthat even the most fledglinganthropologist would deny. For your passing information, the personage generallyregarded as the “God ofthe Witches” is Dis Pater or Cernunnos, a Gallic corruption of the RomanJupiter. Jupiter is a Latinrendition of Zeus, who in turn was a corruption of the Egyptian Amon. Theancient Greeks knew Uast as“Diospolis” - the “City of Zeus”. Do the Wiccans really know whom they areworshipping?Oh, that’s right - they worship a Goddess who, if you listen to Leo Martello,originated in Sicily prior toits Greek colonization. And her name is a closely-guarded secret. Not really:When the Phœnicians founded365 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 28, VII/1972.- 230 -Carthage some years previously, they introduced its patroness to Sicily as well.This figure was Tanit,derived from the Ugaritic Astarte, consort to the Tyre god Baal Hammon. Astarteis a corruption of Isis.Complicating the situation a little more is that the Hebrews, by now a littleconfused as to whom theywould or would not worship, gave Astarte a sex-change operation and acknowledgeda new Dæmon -Astaroth. The independently evolved nature of Astaroth is distinctly Satanic,however, and thus he isincluded in the Satanic pantheon.But we digress; we were talking about the B.M. The main floor exhibits occupythree rooms of thehouse. Up a flight of stairs is the “ceremonial magick” exhibit (a white-robedmannequin in a TE TRAGRAM MA TON pentacle) and a room of Ouija boards, Tarot cards, and astrologycharts.Then there was the celebrated Satanism exhibit. Housed [as were the otherexhibits] in somethingresembling a converted fruit crate, it consisted of a high school theme bookwith “The Black Mass” writtenon the cover in felt-marker, a skull with two wooden horns resting on a shoeboxcovered with redgiftwrapping paper, 4 candleholders & 3 black candles, a sample pact with theDevil, a knife, an expiredChurch of Satan membership card, and Dr. LaVey’s photo from the cover of Lookmagazine. The exhibitcaption was on a 3x5 card thumbtacked to the edge of the crate. It wascharmingly uncomplimentary andtotally inaccurate, but no explicit reference to the Church of Satan wasincluded.Back in New York City we turned our attention to the occult retail market. Thereare threeestablishments that advertise in the Village Voice - the “Blessed Be”, the“Warlock Shop”, and the“Magician”. Visiting the first two, we might have been back in Bay Shore; theywere unkempt, and theirproduct lines were keyed to shallow mentality.“The Magician” is located at 177 West 4th Street in Greenwich Village, about 1/2block distant fromEdgar Allen Poe’s old residence. Imagine our surprise when we walked into animpeccable littleestablishment which would have been welcome in the central shopping area of anymajor city. The wood-panelled walls were set off by a tremendous fireplace, and the displays ofbooks, incense, candles, robes,jewelry, and magical accessories were neatly arranged, well lit, and evidentlychosen with a connoisseur’staste. The walls were covered with paintings of sublime sensitivity. 366The saturnine proprietor was arranging some O.T.O. Tarot decks on the glasscounter. I walked over totake a closer look at one of them - and had my hand knocked firmly away. “Look,but don’t touch!” Iapologized, examined the cards that were carefully presented to me, and finallydecided to order a deck.As I gave the owner my name and address, his jaw fell open - whereupon heintroduced himself as RonaldBarrett II° of the Lilith Grotto. Now it was my turn to be surprised - not tomention pleased that theChurch of Satan’s presence in New York was so elegant.Searching for an appropriate site for the Priesthood meeting, I went uptown to72nd and Central ParkWest, location of the old Dakota building that had appeared as the “Bramford” inthe film Rosemary’sBaby. There was no restaurant in the Dakota itself, as it turned out, but rightacross the street from thefront entrance was a charming little restaurant called the “Ile de France” [20West 72nd, should you be inthe neighborhood. Since then it has changed its name (and atmosphere) to“Billy’s Steak House”].Entering, I learned from the host that his mousse au chocolat had been theinspiration for Rosemary’sSatanic dessert in Ira Levin’s original novel. The “Ile de France” was delightedat the prospect of a SatanicPriesthood dinner on the premises, and it seemed “meant”. I wrote to SanFrancisco and asked Anton andDiane if the Church would pick up part of the expense for the facilities, andDiane replied:Enclosed is the requested amount for the III° dinner. We agree; it seems like agood way to boostmorale. It sounds like fun. Wish we were there to join you. The old Dakota isquite a place, but getting pastthe sentry at the front gate is impossible!Thanks very much for the thorough reports on Buckland and his operations. Vewyinta-westing! Uponreading your comments and looking over the photos, Anton said, “Now that’s whatI call a report!” We366 Aquino, M.A., “Hoofbeats” in Cloven Hoof, November-December VII/1972.- 231 -were also amused by the encounter with Ronald Barrett. He used to be one of ourAgents before he movedfrom Maryland to New York.Anton and everybody here are fine. Bet you’re getting homesick. Next Wednesdayis the unveiling ofthe wax figure [to take place at a luncheon for all women reporters, in front ofthe Lord’s Last Suppertableau]. Wish you wuz here. Jan too. I’ll send clips of the news stories. 367At 145 Jefferson Street in San Francisco was the Wax Museum at Fisherman’sWharf, offering thecustomary “chamber of horrors” including vampires, werewolves, and torturescenes; and in 1972 theowners decided to include a Satanism exhibit starring Anton Szandor LaVey.Shortly before Halloween the exhibit was unveiled with more than the usualfanfare, Anton LaVeybeing - alone among the horror exhibits - a local celebrity. The figure is anexcellent, virtually exactlikeness. As originally unveiled, it stood before a rich, purple curtained altarbearing an altar girl withnude breasts. The LaVey figure held aloft a beautifully-made Toledo sword - aduplicate, in fact, of theactual sword from the main ritual chamber at 6114 California Street - and woreround its neck one of theWolf-Brown Baphomet medallions.A decade later the exhibit was still in place. But the Baphomet medallion wasgone, a cheap bronzesword replaced the golden one, the altar girl’s breasts were covered, and thealtar itself was draped in redhangings far duller and less ornate than the original purple. A third figure -that of a kneeling man in acowled robe - was added in front of the altar. In 2013 the original museum isbeing completely replaced bya new one; the fate of the LaVey statue and exhibit is not yet known.As Halloween approached, New York’s news media were again interviewing theLilith Grotto, withboth the Priestess herself and Ronald Barrett as a consequence of “The Magician”[see Appendix #66].On the night before the Regional Conference, the Priesthood Dinner was held atthe “Ile de France”. Inattendance were Lilith Sinclair, Michael Grumboski, Dale Seago, myself, andJanet (who had flown outfrom Santa Barbara for the occasion). A very excellent cherry duck was served -followed by the infamous"},{"pageContent":"mousse au chocolat - and toasts were given to the Prince of Darkness and to hisHigh Priest. There was agreat feeling of satisfaction in that all present had helped to bring the Churchof Satan through so manyordeals at great distance from one another.And now it was time for the Third Eastern Regional Conference, perhaps bestdescribed by MichaelGrumboski in the next Changes IV:The Third Eastern Regional Conference of the Church of Satan was held in NewYork City on theevening of October 29, VII. Delegates from the eastern and midwestern UnitedStates were in attendance.Introductions were conducted in the Hilton’s Penn Bar amidst a round of Cokesand excellent company.Needless to say, the sight of such an august body did manage to raise a feweyebrows, mainly from thedelegates of a Christian convention which ran concurrently with ours.The introductions over, we returned to the banquet room for dinner. The hotel,in keeping with the spiritof Halloween, bedecked the tables with flaming red cloths, silver candleholders, and black candles. Duringthe business sessions two main topics were discussed, the first being theChurch’s public image and thesecond being intermember communications.In view of the increasing interest in magic and the occult, many pseudo-magicalcircles have arisen.Some have even claimed complete ownership of the dæmons/Satan/Lucifer, not toounlike Catholicism andJehovah. We, however, are the only organization with a sound and workablephilosophy - a functionalorganization, responsible officials, and a marvelous deity: yourself!But if you mention Satanism to the man on the street, he still links the term todevil worship, sex, drugs,grave robbing, and the like. The delegates suggested we whip up a series ofthought-provoking articles,booklets, or perhaps even a commercial film. These media would discuss thephilosophy of the Church, butuntil the conclusion the term “Satan” or “Satanism” would be omitted, thusincreasing the impact of ourphilosophy upon John Q. Public. Increased public exposure of Regional Agents andmembers was also367 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 20, VII/1972.- 232 -suggested. With the discontinuation of the intermember roster from the ClovenHoof, the problem ofmembers’ meeting for discussion has increased. A new suggestion was thatmembers’ names and addressesbe printed in local Grotto newsletters. After the end of the business session, aspecial closed ConferenceRitual was conducted. 368 Due to its nature, it cannot be discussed in an openpublication like Changes IV.In keeping with the tradition of the First and Second Conferences, an informalpost-conference partywas held away from the initial site. The coming of dawn heralded the end of thefestivities, wherein thisdelegate climbed into bed and made a mental note to be extra kind to the daymaid; she had her work cutout for her. 369Dale Seago’s reaction to his ceremonial ordination was recorded in a letter to“Lana Green” at theCentral Grotto: “Of the ordination there is little I can say. Words areinadequate to describe what I felt. Itwas an irrevocable commitment on my part, and I will never be quite the sameagain.” 370At the Bramford dinner, and again at the Conclave, speculation had arisenconcerning the actuallineage of the Order of the Trapezoid and the identity of its Infernal patron.Unprepared for anarchæological analysis, I declined to answer in detail, promising to examine thematter more thoroughly inthe next Cloven Hoof. Grumboski remarked ruefully to Dale Seago:Magister Aquino must have written you, Lilith, and myself on the same subject.In my letter he seemeda little cryptic, but he has a talent for that. In most of my correspondencewith him, unless the subject wereof dire import, his letters were hints at solutions, not answers. 371By late November I had done some additional research on the subjects addressedin the secret letter toAnton LaVey at the time of my IV° recognition. The result was a Hoof articleentitled “TheSource” (Appendix #67). Though sketchy, it did lay initial groundwork towards ametaphysical basis forSatanism prior to and thus independent of Judaic/Christian mythology. DianeLaVey wrote to me:We have received the newsletter packet and are really pleased with this issue.Anton was delighted tosee the Osiris/Christ misinterpretations discussed, and I really learnedsomething from the piece.“O Little Town of Bethlehem Co., Ltd” is most amusing. Mr. Edwards must reallybe studying theAquino literary style. We loved your account of the Buckland Museum, and torefer to Dr. Leo LouisMartello as “Leo” really takes the cake. 372Anton’s essay for the “Source” issue was entitled “Ravings from Tartarus” andaddressed theoccasional membership complaint about ritual magic that “didn’t work”. Such areaction, said Anton,stems from the practitioner’s failure to ritualize the initial “problem” out ofexistence via the ritualsequence. 373Ridding oneself of the initial obsession, he added, would free the magician forfresh, creative activity.Alternately an effective ritual, by creating an effective symbol or substitutefor the obsession, wouldsatisfy the magician’s craving - quite possibly more effectively than the actualobject of the obsessioncould have done. 374368 Appendix #60.369 Grumboski, Michael in Changes IV #1, November 3, VII/1972.370 Letter, Dale Seago to Lana Green, November 7, VII/1972.371 Letter, Michael Grumboski to Dale Seago, November 13, VII/1972.372 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 21, VII/1972.373 Cf.

He wasscheduled to give alecture on witchcraft at a Brooklyn church, so I dropped by the Warlock Shop tocheck on the exact timeand location. What I did not know is that, a short time prior to my visit,Herman Slater, the WarlockShop’s owner, had given the bum’s rush to a New York University lecturer by thename of Owen Rachleff.Rachleff had just published a debunking book entitled The Occult Conceit and wasnow persona nongrata among the New York occult subculture.When I arrived, one of Slater’s assistants was manning the shop - primed, nodoubt, to repulse anyreturn assault by Rachleff. Although I was treated courteously enough, I laterfound myself immortalizedon the front page of Leo Martello’s WICA Newsletter (all sic):Owen Rachleff visited WARLOCK SHOP in Brooklyn, took notes for an hour, listenedtoconversations, finally was told “Get out - you’re a spy” by owner. 375 LaterHerman Slater recognized hisphoto on back of Rachleff’s book. He was described as “looking like Dracula!”.He came in there again, ifreport from one of the salesmen is correct, asking for literature on the FRIENDSOF THE CRAFT seminarat the FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH. We are looking forward to seeing him or some ofhis spies. And wewill know who they are, if they don’t identify themselves, by their hostilequestions at end of talk. 376When I attended the lecture a week hence [and before seeing WICA #20], I soonbecame aware of themany hostile looks being directed towards me. Although I was dressedunremarkably in coat and tie, Icould only assume that Martello and Slater had had an abrupt clash with 6114 -and had identified me as aSatanist. After the lecture I went forward to introduce myself and tell Martellohow interesting his talk hadbeen [which, despite myself, it was], he burst into laughter. Only then did Ilearn that I had been “spottedas Rachleff”.That same month the Club of Rome, a group of physical and social scientistsinterested in computerforecasting, published a book entitled The Limits to Growth - the first of whatwould eventually be called“doomsday” scenarios. I was impressed with the Club of Rome’s alarming forecastsand wrote Antonconcerning my plans to review the book for the next Hoof. Diane replied:I had very little time to discuss this with Anton before he left for southernCalifornia this afternoon, so Ican’t elaborate much on the brief note he wrote out for me to read to you overthe phone:“True, the facts are there, but the computerized facts are based on known data,as they must be. ‘Thereare more things in heaven and Earth’, etc. The Club of Rome has its ‘purpose’ indisseminating its findings -all quite Satanic, from an overall vantage.”I should tell you too that he discussed with me the necessity of a privatemeeting with you after youhave returned to California. Whenever we can get together, he has a great dealin the way of bothadministrative and instructional matters he wants to discuss with you. He said,“You know, Mike is my mostvaluable student.”We were really amused by your description of what happened when you attendedMartello’s lecture. Doyou remember Anton’s telling you that you looked like Lugosi when you lastvisited us? Very interesting.I’ve seen Rachleff on television, and I don’t think he looks a bit like Dracula- Lugosi’s or anyone else’sversion. Funny that it was Slater’s description of Rachleff as looking likeDracula that made his salesmanthink you were he. The comparison between you and Rachleff is more complimentaryto Rachleff than toyou, I might add; Rachleff is no dreamboat.377375 I was not so admonished, so this first visitor may indeed have beenRachleff.376 Martello, Leo in WICA Newsletter #20, 1972.377 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 27, VII/1972.- 234 -After the Third Eastern Conference Lilith Sinclair and I had begun to discussthe prospects for a firstnational Conference for the Church. Since East-3 had been so successful, Ispeculated that such a nationalconference might itself be planned for New York.A short distance north of the city was the old Gothic mansion Lyndhurst,familiar to television viewersas “Collinwood” in the motion picture House of Dark Shadows [made as abig-budget sequel to thefamous television series]. It was located, aptly enough, in Sleepy Hollow -stalking ground of theinfamous Headless Horseman. The mansion was available for parties, Lilith and Idiscovered during ourvisit, and adjacent to it were many fine hotels which could host a conferenceproper. Regretfully weconcluded that the stumbling block was Lyndhurst’s distance from any majorairport, so the idea wasfinally abandoned. But the mansion itself was breathtaking, and I had advisedthe LaVeys not to miss it ontheir next trip east.Lilith and I arrived back in New York City just in time to find the newhardcover edition of the SatanicBible on sale at Samuel Weiser’s bookstore. I was pleased to find my newintroduction therein, butdisappointed that Anton’s text had not been freshly typeset [but was ratherphotocopied from the Avonpaperback]. Diane wrote to me in early December:Anton just walked in with a copy of the hardcover Bible. For the most part Iagree with your criticismsbut also agree with Anton that the “reprinted” look of the main text in contrastto the fresh type of theIntroduction gives it a sort of “new edition of a classic” appearance. Thisespecially since University Bookslimits its occult selections to those which, like ’em or not, have becomestandards in the field. See, if youlook on the bright side …I think the jacket looks nice, but Anton is peeved with the imitation clothcover. Well, maybe we can dothat private edition someday. I haven’t read your introduction carefully enoughyet to see the “corrections”in your punctuation, but I believe you! The eternal battle betweenauthors/editors. We know it well.Your visit to Lyndhurst and Sleepy Hollow sounds like great fun. You’re right:The High Priest andPriestess would feel quite comfortable at Lyndhurst!We just got a fantastic book called Enchanted Visions which is crammed withwonderful pictures - plusfine text - of the most magnificent follies in the world. To name a few:Neuschwanstein [lots of interiorshots], Archbishop Markus “the Hydro-Maniac of Hellbrunn” Sittikus’ castle,Ferdinand II of Austria’spalace [with illustrations of his art collection which indicate his passion forfreaks - Vlad’s now-famousportrait is there], and of course San Simeon [many interior shots not usuallyseen].These are but a few, but the list is endless. It’s beautifully printed; thecolor work is superb and the textfascinating. The opulence of Lyndhurst would fit in perfectly with all theothers in the book. 378My work at the Merrill Lynch headquarters finally over, I returned to Californiafor the impendingpublication of Anton’s long-awaited Satanic Rituals. At the close of December Ifound a copy, perused itdelightedly, and wrote enthusiastically to the author:Apparently the Satanic Rituals is being distributed to department stores first.As yet the book has notappeared in any of Santa Barbara’s major bookstores, but this afternoon Ifinally located a copy in the booksection of a drugstore near my office.While I have not yet been able to study the book with the care it obviouslydemands, even a firstreading is sufficient to indicate that it is the Last Word on its subject. Overthe past several years I have readscores of volumes of “ritual magic”, and none has managed to convey even a hintof the power and splendorrevealed in this book. I am frankly in awe. And to be included in the dedicationis, in my estimation, one ofthe most profound honors I have yet received.379378 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, December 6, VII/1972.379 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, December 29, VII/1972.[index-235_1.jpg]- 235 -In the Satanic Rituals Anton LaVey endeavored to establish to the public hispreeminent and definitiveknowledge of Black Magic - by the publication and critical analysis ofpresumably the most powerful,blasphemous, and suppressed ritual texts in his archives. One would think thatexposure of such textswould be just what a Satanist should not do, since it would be tantamount toputting loaded guns into thehands of children. But the book was published, and no unpleasant incidents haveever been attributed to it.So what exactly does it accomplish?It may be helpful to begin by drawing a distinction between Satanic magic andSatanic ritual. Theformer, as defined in the Satanic Bible is operative; it is the formalized,precise working of the will of themagician upon his external environment. [Hence the term “Working”, which isoften used to describe actsof both Greater and Lesser Magic.]Ritual is one of many devices which may be used for magical purposes (i.e. as avehicle to focus thewill through sensory reinforcement), but rituals themselves possess noindependent power. Rather they are“mind mirrors”. They enable the magician to see his will articulated anddisplayed before him, so that hemay adjust and refine it. Some rituals are designed only for thismirror/reflection function; these areillustrative rituals. Others contain an additional step: Having first served todefine and refine themagician’s will, they then strengthen and magnify the power of that will andlaunch it forth into thematerial universe. These are operative rituals.In the Satanic Bible Anton draws a distinction between Lesser Magic and GreaterMagic, thedifference being that Greater Magic makes use of the ritual “mind mirror” whileLesser Magic does not.The difference between Lesser Magic and Greater Magic, particularly as employedby Adeptmagicians, is comparable to the difference between conventional and nuclearbombs. Many Adepts, infact, become increasingly reluctant to use Greater Magic except in the mostunusual and important ofsituations, preferring rather to influence the material universe by theirskillful employment of LesserMagic. The drain of mental and physical energy is much less severe, and theresults are far more limited,hence easier to predict and adjust on an ongoing basis.By these criteria it can be seen that the lust, curse, and compassion rituals inthe Satanic Bible areexamples of basic operative rituals, i.e. Greater Magic. The contents of theCompleat Witch generallyinvolve Lesser Magic. And the contents of the Satanic Rituals are non-magical(i.e. illustrative) ritual.Their effects will accordingly be manifest on the practitioner(s) themselves,not on a second party.In his introductory essay “Concerning the Rituals”, Anton draws a furtherdistinction between ritualsand ceremonies: A ritual affects the practitioner; i.e. it executes the “mindmirror” function. A ceremony,on the other hand, is merely a pageant or play for psychodramatic illustrationof a belief or philosophy.There is often a fine line between rituals and ceremonies, since a particularlymoving ceremony willtend to influence participants ritualistically. Profane religions’ observancesconsist almost exclusively ofceremonies, with the better ones eliciting primitive ritualistic reaction byclergy and laity alike. [Generallythey do not understand the actual mechanics of what they are doing; they mistaketheir subconscious- 236 -ritualistic reaction for “apprehension of the divine” or some-such delusion. SeeWilliam James’ Varietiesof Religious Experience.]Psychologically, observes Anton, the actual function of a Satanic ritual is toenable the mind, whoseprocesses are normally governed by objective perceptions of external phenomena,to control reality bysubjective expression. Such an exercise in “inversion of thought” might bedangerous in an uncontrolledenvironment, he continues, for which reason the controlled environment of aritual chamber is preferable.This is true in a twofold sense: First, the presence of inharmonious influencesin a ritual environmentcan weaken, distort, or even abort the effectiveness of the ritual. Secondly, asuccessful ritual will exertsome influence on all who are present. If some of those present are notinitiatorily qualified for exposureto it, it could have a traumatic effect upon them. A ritual chamber keeps theritual atmosphere in and thenon-ritual environment out.If good ceremonies are inspiring, good rituals are exhilarating. In fact theyare often so exhilaratingthat the practitioner may become obsessed with them - to the detriment ofrational, critical analysis. InLiber O, the essay so named by Aleister Crowley because he intended it to beread at the very beginningof a magical curriculum, he warned students:In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits andConjurations; of Gods, Spheres,Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterialwhether these exist or not. Bydoing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestlywarned against attributingobjective reality or philosophic validity to any of them. The advantages to begained from them are chieflythese: (a) a widening of the horizon of the mind, and (b) an improvement of thecontrol of the mind.The student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will findhimself confronted by things(ideas or beings) too glorious or too dreadful to be described. It is essentialthat he remain the master of allthat he beholds, hears, or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusionand the prey of madness …There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fail toget some result; but there isgreat danger that he will be led astray, obsessed and overwhelmed by hisresults, even though it be by thosewhich it is necessary that he should attain …It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result theimportance which it at first seems topossess. 380One may become reasonably proficient at Lesser Magic without mastering ritual.If one does notmaster ritual, however, one will never succeed at Greater Magic. The SatanicRituals offers a selection oftexts which are sufficiently sophisticated to introduce the new magician to awide range of “certainresults”. It is then up to the magician to evaluate and apply those resultsintelligently.The Satanic Rituals is a book in three “layers”. The first is that of literaltruth, which the bookpurports to be. The second is that of deception, which much of the book actuallyis. The third layer is thatof underlying magical instruction, which transcends mundane conventions of truthand falsehood. Thebook is thus a Working in itself - not merely a compendium of facts for readersto put to independent use.In the vulgar sense, ritual is a form of “self deceit”. Accordingly for thenovice Satanist to experiencethe strengthening and illuminating results of ritual, the author of the SatanicRituals must deceive himwith convincing scenarios and texts. At first reading by an uninformed person,therefore, the SatanicRituals appears to contain historically authentic rituals and true backgroundinformation concerning them.This is the first layer.Upon careful investigation, which most readers of the book are disinclined toundertake, many of the“facts” will be exposed as false. This is the second layer, and to thenon-magician it is disillusioning. Hefeels betrayed, or he may simply decide that Anton LaVey lacked the knowledgeand/or integrity toresearch his subject adequately. Those who “burn out” at the second layer of thebook tend to have read it- but not to have applied it through actual conduct of a ritual. Here againAnton has warned the student in380 Crowley, Aleister, “Liber O”, The Equinox #I-2, September 1901, page #11.- 237 -his introductory essay, pointing out that success in magic derives from theapplication of principles, notmerely collection of data.A person who applies the principles in the book by actually performing therituals and ceremonies willdiscover that they work. Should he discover the factual flaws in the essays andtexts, he will be somewhatconfused as to why they work. Only then will he begin to realize the truthunderlying the art and scienceof magic: that the powers to create and to define are functions of the will.Thus he reaches the third andfinal layer of the Satanic Rituals.The series of rituals begins with the traditional Black Mass. In theintroductory essay it is said to bethe one performed by the Society of Lucifer in 19th-20th century France. Inactuality it is a somewhat lessshocking version of the Missa Solemnis composed by Wayne West (Appendix #7),which in turn drewheavily from J.K. Huysmans’ Là-Bas, the famous classic of French Satanism. Theextract from Là-Bas inAppendix #68 may be compared with Appendix #7 and with the Black Mass in theSatanic Rituals.Background details concerning the historic Black Mass are most convenientlyavailable in H.T.F. Rhodes’The Satanic Mass.The purpose of any Black Mass, as Anton explained in the Satanic Bible, is topurge participants oronlookers of any conditioned fears they may have as a consequence of oldsuperstitions or indoctrinations.Once one has seen his sacred cows trampled upon with impunity, he will neverfeel quite the same aboutthem again, no matter how artificial he recognizes the desecration to be. Thisis illustrated in GeorgeOrwell’s 1984, wherein the magician O’Brien forces his victim/student WinstonSmith to “trample uponthe sacred cow” of his love for Julia. While Winston recognizes that force wasused on him, henonetheless finds himself unable to recapture his original illusion of love forher. Julia, put through asimilar “Black Mass” incorporating different elements of psychological force,experiences the samedisruption of her value system:“Sometimes,” she said [to Winston], “they threaten you with something -something you can’t stand upto, can’t even think about. And then you say, ‘Don’t do it to me, do it tosomebody else, do it to so-and-so.’And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that youjust said it to make themstop and didn’t really mean it. But that isn’t true. At the time when ithappens, you do mean it. You thinkthere’s no other way of saving yourself, and you’re quite ready to save yourselfthat way. You want it tohappen to the other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. All you careabout is yourself.”“All you care about is yourself,” he echoed.“And after that you don’t feel the same toward the other person any longer.”“No,” he said, “you don’t feel the same.” 381Following the Black Mass in the Satanic Rituals is “The Ceremony of the StiflingAir” (Appendix #2).Comparing Anton LaVey’s original comments concerning it to those which appear inthe Satanic Rituals,it can be seen that a good deal of colorful imagination was brought to bear uponthe published version.Anton introduces the essay with “Cassilda’s Song” from The King in Yellow, whichhas no relevanceto the “Stifling Air”. [In the original 6114 ritual inventory, “Cassilda’s Song”was included in “TheMadness of Andelsprutz” (Appendix #4).]He states that the original Knights Templar developed the “Stifling Air” as aconsequence of their visitto the Yezidis in the 13th century. In fact there is no evidence that they madesuch a visit, nor is thereanything in the “Stifling Air” text reflecting actual Yezidi theology.Anton then suggests that the “Stifling Air”, as a 6th Degree of the KnightsTemplar, is designed tofollow a rite of the Ancient Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine whereinthey travel beyond the“Devil’s Pass”. The actual ritual text of the A.A.O.N.M.S., however, makes itclear that the candidate doesnot enter the pass:381 Orwell, George, 1984. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1949, page #240.- 238 -This is the place where our brethren stop to sprinkle the Devil’s Pass withurine. You will contribute afew drops of urine to commemorate the time and place where all who pass hererenounce the wiles andevils of the world to worship at the Shrine of Islam. 382A comparison is next drawn to the “Seventh Degree” - actually Adeptus Exemptus(7)=[4] - of AleisterCrowley’s A.'.A.'.. Anton suggests that in the (7)=[4] rite Crowley onlyappeared to present the initiatewith a choice to become either a Babe of the Abyss or a Black Brother, and thatthe Beast secretly trickedall aspirants into the latter state of being.In actuality there is no ceremony as such; the A.'.A.'. document pertaining mostdirectly to thetransition from (7)=[4] to Babe of the Abyss is Liber VII - Liber Liberi VelLapidis Lazuli, AdvmbratioKabbalæ Ægyptiorum Sub Figvra VII (“being the Voluntary Emancipation of acertain Exempt Adeptfrom his Adeptship. These are the Birth Words of a Master of the Temple”), oneof the three Holy Booksthat Crowley wrote upon his return from China in 1907. Liber VII takes the formof a long, ecstatic love-ritual to Pan and bears no resemblance to the “Stifling Air”. Nor do LiberCDLXXIV - Os Abysmi velDaáth (a purely intellectual ritual for entering the Abyss) or Liber CCCXXXIII -The Book of Lies (officialpublication for Babes of the Abyss). I agree with Anton that, under Crowley’ssystem, it is a conceptualimpossibility for an individual to deliberately cross the Abyss to merge withthe godhead while yetretaining self-consciousness. One cannot have one’s cake and eat it too. I wouldsay that Crowleysucceeded in crossing the Abyss, but that none of his students were able to dolikewise, and that Crowley’sactual state of magical being Beyond the Abyss was other than he assumed it tobe.Presumably, then, the “Stifling Air” is simply an Anton Szandor LaVey creation,concocted in more orless equal parts from Raynouard’s 1806 drama Les Templiers and James Thomson’s1880 poem The Cityof Dreadful Night, together with an opening sequence and the 12th Enochian Keyfrom the Satanic Bible.It has as its theme a call for vengeance by the original Knights Templar, amonastic order ofknighthood founded in 1118 and destroyed by Philip IV of France in 1314 [whenJacques de Molay, thelast Grand Master, was executed]. 383Because of political and military alliances which the Templars maintained withMoslem forces inPalestine, the order was rumored to be un-Christian and even Satanic. Its owndoctrinal text, the Rule ofthe Temple, belies this.384 Accounts of the Templars spitting on the cross, etc.are almost certainly theresult of the racks and screws of Philip’s torturers. The order’s supposedworship of the Devil is alsofictitious and again resulted from confusion concerning its traffic with Islamin the eastern Mediterranean.“Mohammed” in Spanish is Mafomat, and in Provençal it is pronounced “Bafomet”.385 The Arabicabufihamat translates to “father” or “source of understanding”. 386The next ceremony, “Das Tierdrama”, is again a variation of the original Churchof Satan version(Appendix #6). Here it is attributed to the Order of the Illuminati in Germany[see Appendix #63].Records of the doctrines and ceremonies of that order exist in the papers of itstwo principal leaders,Adam Weishaupt and Baron de Knigge, however, and I have found nothing resemblingthe “Tierdrama”among them. 387 Nor, as Anton also suggests, is it from the texts of the O.T.O.or Golden Dawn. 388382 Hannah, Walton, Christian by Degrees.

[The Germanin Appendix #5 has been corrected.]A 6114 origin for “Die Elektrischen Vorspiele”, however, may be assumed forother reasons. Thetheme of the “Hounds of Tindalos” [changed from the original text to “Hounds ofthe Angles”] derivesfrom Frank Belknap Long’s famous story The Hounds of Tindalos, written in 1929.After my article onLovecraftian ritual appeared in the HPL-theme magazine Nyctalops, Long wrote tome:The inclusion of “The Hounds of T.” in that Satanic ritual startled me no end. Ihad no previousknowledge of this. Now I am really frightened, fearing that - oh, well. I shallprobably be able to overcomethat fear by telling myself, over and over, that the “Hounds” were solely an FBLconstruct and that I thoughtof them one morning while shaving. But still - one never knows.I knew absolutely nothing, I can assure you, of LaVey’s ritual use of “TheHounds” until the arrival ofthe Nyctalops article, and seemingly none of my friends read the Avon volume.Otherwise I’m quite suremy attention would have been called to it long before this [1978].I was appalled, as you surmise, that LaVey ascribed “The Hounds” to Nazi/SSideology. It waspublished in Weird Tales long before the rise of the Nazis and even before HPL’sC-mythos had taken on itslater, elaborately structured form. It could, of course, have gone back to thevery wild period of Germanexpressionism that immediately followed World War I - no, that began as early as1910 or so - if I did notknow better. I simply pulled the title out of thin air, in searching forsomething hideously chilling (sometitle with a fiery implication attached to it as well perhaps), and I rememberthat the word “tinder” leaptimmediately into my mind.Now another specter from “long ago and far away” has arisen to astound me. Inthe just-published newvolume about the Necronomicon [Long is talking about The Necronomicon by GeorgeHay (Ed.) - M.A.] anelaborate ancestry has been traced for John Dee’s translation. I pulled thatnonexistent translation out of thinair too, and it appeared at the head of “The Space Eaters” in Weird Tales inJuly 1928. HPL immediatelyincorporated it into the C-mythos. The incredible things we set in motionwithout remotely suspecting theywould have such momentous future consequences!390There was no inter-war “Black Order” in Germany of an occult society nature. Thetitle Das SchwarzeKorps identified the Nazi SS only. Its esoteric research section was theAbteilung zur Überprüfung dersogenannten Geheimwissenschaften of the Ahnenerbe or “Ancestral Heritage”organization created byHeinrich Himmler [as Curator] and headed jointly by President Professor WalterWüst and Secretary-General Wolfram Sievers, who reported directly to Himmler’s Chief of Staff,SS-General Karl Wolff. 391Anton thus incorrectly attributes such research or activity to theSicherheitsdienst (SD), which was thedomestic and foreign intelligence division of the RSHA (Security Department)headed by SS-GeneralReinhard Heydrich. 392 [See Appendix #44.]The English-language text of the EV is actually a plagiarism of an obscure1930s’ text, the “8thEmerald Tablet of Thoth”, written by Colorado occultist Claude Doggins (d.1963), who under the name389 Wells, H.G., The Island of Dr. Moreau.390 Letter, Frank Belknap Long to M.A. Aquino, September 2, 1978. Long wrote TheHounds of Tindalos in 1929, and it has been reissuedoften since then. Cf. H.P. Lovecraft et al., Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos, SaukCity: Arkham House, 1969.391 Information concerning the occult aspects of the Ahnenerbe-SS is containedin the Jeweled Tablets of Set and in the archives of the Templeof Set’s Order of the Trapezoid.392 Hoehne, Heinrich, The Order of the Death’s Head. Hamburg: Verlag derSpiegel, 1966.- 240 -of “Maurice Doreal” founded the Brotherhood of the White Temple. Apparently Mr.Doggins had beeninspired by Mr. Long’s story before Anton LaVey rediscovered it.393“Die Elektrischen Vorspiele”, regardless of its origin, must be counted as oneof the most beautiful andpowerful in the entire Satanic Rituals. I have seen it performed a number oftimes, and with the properequipment and celebrants who understand its purpose, it never fails to arouseone’s awe.It is inspired by, if not actually derived from the German expressionist cinemaof the 1920s, of whichAnton LaVey was a true connoisseur. An approximation of its effect may be seenin the sequence in FritzLang’s Metropolis in which the robotrix is brought to life before a large,inverse pentagram. Strangeeffects via the use of unfamiliar angles may be sampled in The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari.394Not only psychologically but physically it is also an extremely dangerous ritual- and certainly not onewhich I would recommend to a novice in magic. The effects of three phenomenal -in addition, of course,to the immediately-evident danger from high-energy lightning discharge - may besummarized as follows:Atmospheric electromagnetic (EM) activity: The human body communicatesinternally by EM andelectrochemical impulses. The EM field displayed in Kirlian photographs, theeffectiveness of acupuncture,and the body’s physical responses to various types of EM radiation (X-rays,infrared radiation, visible lightspectra, etc.) all exemplify human sensitivity to EM forces and fields.Atmospheric EM activity is regularlyaltered by such phenomena as sunspot eruptions and gravitational stresses whichdistort the Earth’smagnetic field. Under varying EM conditions, humans are more or less receptiveto new ideas. Per Dr. L.J.Ravitz: “Electrodynamic field constructs add fuel to the assumption unifyingliving matter harmoniouslywith the operations of nature, postulating that each biologic thing is organizedby a total dynamic pattern,the expression of an electromagnetic field no less than nonliving systems; andthat as points on spectrums,these two entities may at last take their positions in the organization of theuniverse in such a way bothexplicable and rational … A tenable theory has been provided for emergence ofthe nervous system,developing not from functional demands, but instead deriving as a result ofdynamic forces imposed on cellgroups by the total field pattern. Living matter now has a definition of statebased on relativity field physics,through which it has been possible to detect a measurable property of totalstate functions.” 395Ionization of the air: An abundance of negative condensation nuclei (“air ions”)in ingested airenhances alertness and exhilaration, while an excess of positive ions enhancesdrowsiness and depression.Ionization can be caused by ultraviolet radiation and the discharge of staticelectricity [via a “Jacob’sladder”, Van de Graaf generator, and/or other devices employed in “DieElektrischen Vorspiele”].396Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves: ELF waves (up to 100 Hz) can beartificially produced and,while not normally noticed by the unaided senses, can cause physiologicaldisorders and emotionaldistortion. Infrasonic vibration (up to 20 Hz) can subliminally influence brainactivity to align itself toalpha, beta, delta, or theta wave patterns. 397“The Homage to Tchort” is a ritual supposedly deriving from Russian mythology.In the June 1977issue of The Magic Cat, Margaret A. Wendall (who is fluent in Russian and anex-member of the RussianOrthodox Church) questioned it on several counts. Once again the Russianlanguage translation is flawed,being a mixture of modern Russian and Slavonic (a comparatively archaicdialect). Organized chanting, a393 The text of Doggins’ 8th Tablet can be found on the Internet here:http://www.crystalinks.com/emerald8bw.htmlBoth Doggins/”Doreal” and the Brotherhood of the White Temple can be researchedthrough Internet searches. In 2010 Don Webb (VI°Temple of Set) discovered this pre-origin of the Church of Satan’s ElektrischenVorspiele.394 See Chapter #23 concerning Metropolis and Chapter #25 concerning The Cabinetof Dr. Caligari.395 Ravitz, Leonard J., M.S., M.D., F.R.S.H., “Electromagnetic Field Monitoringof Changing-State Function, including Hypnotic States” inJournal of American Society of Psychosomatic Dentistry and Medicine, Vol. 17,No. 4, 1970.396 Soyke, Fred and Edmonds, Alan, The Ion Effect.

Key words - such as“wolf”, “werewolf”, “dawn”,and “skeleton” - are mistranslated into Russian. Wendall - a Magistra Templi IV°- has contributed anauthentic Black Magical rite to the Jeweled Tablets of Set: the VelikayaSataninskaya Liturgiya. 398Anton’s summarized history of Russian religion is factual enough, although itappears he is talkingprincipally about the clash of Byzantine Christianity with the old Slavonicpaganism. In the “European”Russia of the Czars there were also strong strains of Baltic, Siberian, andAsiatic (at minimum) religiousinfluences. 399The Khlysty or Khlisti sect was founded in the 17th century [not in the 15th, asstated in the SatanicRituals] by one Danilo Filipov. Originally it was scarcely Satanic in doctrine;its adherents practicedfasting and self-scourging to drive out devils of the flesh. After the death ofFilipov, however, it graduallyadopted practices incorporating wild sexual orgies, which, I am sure (a) made itmore popular and (b)made the Christian authorities feel all the more need to suppress it. 400There is no indication that it reintroduced theological elements of paganism,although on one occasionGrigori Rasputin witnessed a Black Mass incorporating a woman as an altar, therecitation of the Lord’sPrayer in reverse, and the celebrant’s drinking of sacramental wine from thealtar’s navel prior toperforming “acts of perversion” with her. 401Customarily the Khlysty were more oriented towards unencumbered sexuality thananti-Christianityper se. Rasputin’s daughter Maria has described her famous father’s initiationinto the sect thus:The vozhd (leader) began with a prayer that was part of the Orthodox litany, andfor a time he followedthe Church pattern. But gradually he veered away from this course and began tospeak of what he called“the highest worship of God”. This puzzled Grischa (Rasputin) for a moment,until he caught the drift ofwhat was being said, based on a concept that, since each of them was anincarnation of God, each shouldworship and love the others. Grischa understood the idea, for had he not prayedto, and meditated upon theGod within himself? And was not that same idea being taught here?“Therefore, my children, love ye one another.” It was more than an admonition;it was a command, andas one the devotees immediately began to obey. As the vozhd let drop the plainblack robe which had beenhis only covering, the circle of worshippers divested themselves of theirclothing, and Grischa, not wantingto be conspicuous, did the same. He felt strange, somehow, standing next to hisnow naked hostess, whohad seemed such a modest woman, such an average housewife until now.The circle began to move, and the people were soon dancing about the stillfigure of the vozhd, at firstslowly and then faster and faster, until they were moving like dervishes in aring. Except for the slap-slap ofunshod feet they made no sound, until at the height of the near-frenzy inducedby their wild dance, one ofthe women broke from the circle with a wild cry and threw herself upon thevozhd, dragging himunresistingly to the floor, where they were quickly coupled in a passionateembrace.Even as he watched, Grischa was seized from the side and was soon engaged inintercourse with awoman. As one of the outnumbered males he had to serve double and even tripleduty with the women whohad been forced to await their turns. 402Rasputin’s wild, glazed-eyed stare is thus presumably explained!398 Wendall, Margaret A., The Magic Cat, June 1977, pages #3-4.399 See “Slav Countries: Folk Lore of the Forests”, “Baltic Lands: NatureWorship”, “Finland-Ugria: Magic Animals”, and “Siberia: The 3Worlds” in the Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology by Pierre Grimal (Ed.).

Nowhere is this moreevident than in thispassage from the Satanic Rituals essay, in which Anton attributes to Rasputin:… the sort of greatness that moves man forward in his evolutionary development.In Rasputin some sawthat greatness and felt its effect in ways they could not understand, ways thatsummoned the pain of theirown inadequacy. Because he used their inner mechanism, this built-in “inadequacydetector”, Rasputinmade many enemies, along with many sycophants. 403Of all the supposedly Satanic groups identified in the Satanic Rituals, none hasgained more fame andnotoriety than the Yezidis, stars of the section entitled “Pilgrims of the Ageof Fire”. Anton’s introductoryessay offers the following account:The Yezidis are the true worshippers of Satan [under the title “Melek Taus”] butare unable to utter thename “Shaitan” for fear of outside persecution. Their chief “tower of Satan” islocated on Mount Lalesh(sic), and under it a system of caverns leading to other towers and supposedlyterminating at“Schamballah (Carcosa)” may be found. The Yezidis’ Satanic text consists ofAl-Jiwah (sic), dictated byShiek Adi shortly before his death in 1163, and Mashaf Res (sic) - both togethercomprising the BlackBook. There are only four texts of the Black Book in existence: a Carshuniversion in Arabic, two versionsin Syriac, and the Church of Satan’s text, translated from the Arabic manuscriptof Daud-as-Saig (sic). Sosays the Satanic Rituals.The association of the Yezidis with devil-worship in general and Satanism inparticular is a legendwhose origins are difficult to trace. Its 20th-century revival can be attributedto William B. Seabrook’s1927 account Adventures in Arabia, whose section on the Yezidis begins asfollows:Najar Terek bey had told me how, three years before, he had visited the sacredstronghold of theYezidis, in the mountains north of Baghdad, on the Kurdish border, near Mosul -of a strange temple, builton rock terraces hewn from the cliffs of the mountainside, which he had not beenpermitted to enter, butwhich was supposed to contain the great brazen image of a peacock and to leadinto subterranean cavernswhere bloody rites were still performed in worship of the Devil - how he hadseen one of their fabulousSeven Towers, or “Power Houses” - a high, white cone-shaped structure withbright rays flashing from itspinnacle - and it was here that I interrupted him, because I had heard of thoseSeven Towers more than oncebefore, and I believed them to be as absolutely mythical as the Chinese“subterranean kingdom” or thecaves of Sinbad. The tales I had previously heard, and which are widely currentin the East, may be reducedto this:Stretching across Asia, from Northern Manchuria, through Tibet, west throughPersia, and ending in theKurdistan, was a chain of seven towers, on isolated mountaintops; and in each ofthese towers satcontinually a Priest of Satan, who by “broadcasting” occult vibrationscontrolled the destinies of the worldfor evil. 404That Anton LaVey was profoundly moved and inspired by this vision is attested toby the phrasing ofhis letter of recognition for the IV° [see Chapter #16], as well as by theinclusion of Yezidi lore in theSatanic Bible and Satanic Rituals.Lalish is a valley in the Syrian province of Shaykhan, near the Turkish border.At its western end is amountain named Hizrat, partway up the southern slope of which is located theShrine of Sheikh Adi. It is along, rectangular ashlar building capped by two tall white cone-shaped towers.One enters it through acourtyard at its western end. Surmounting the doorway to the shrine is a giltornament depicting twopeacocks and two lions. On the door is written in Arabic: “In the name of God,the merciful, the403 LaVey, Anton Szandor, The Satanic Rituals. New York: Avon Books, 1972, page#135.404 Seabrook, William, Adventures in Arabia. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co.,1927, pages #289-290.- 243 -compassionate, creator of Heaven and Earth, bow for this residence: the place ofSheikh Adi al-Hakari,Sheikh of the Yezidis.”On the right side of the doorway is cut in relief the image of a snake, keptblackened by periodicapplications of oil. Within the shrine is a large, rectangular hall (30x12m)divided into northern/upper andsouthern/lower levels. In two smaller chapels behind the northern level, anddirectly under the two cone-towers, are the tomb-altars of Sheikh Adi and Sheikh Assin/Hasan - surmounted bywooden boxes coveredwith silk of various colors.In the chapel of Sheikh Assin there is a small door through which visitors arenot normally allowed.Seabrook, however, obtained permission to visit this innermost sanctum from theMir (chief) of theYezidis, and recounted his experience as follows:The priest procured a torch, and we reentered the temple, went through thelittle door, down a very oldflight of damp stone steps, through a dungeon-like passage.At the foot of the steps where we stopped and stood, we found ourselves in avaulted cavern, partlynatural, it seemed, and partly hewn from the rock, and around a corner the soundof rushing water - a soundwhich we had heard as a murmur in the upper temple, but had supposed to comefrom some nearby streamflowing down the mountainside. We could not see the whole of the cavern or guesshow far it extended.Its floor at the foot of the steps was covered with water, which I guessed fromthe slope to be not morethan ankle-deep. But the priest made it an excuse to prevent us from goingfurther, declaring that there wasno use getting our feet wet since there was nothing more to see.I peered about by the light of the torch to see whether I could observe anyinscriptions on the wall, anysigns of an altar, niches, or other indications that the place was used forritual purposes - and though thelight was flickering and bad, I was pretty surely convinced that there wasnothing of the kind within ourrange of vision.It was a place admirably suited to the weird and dreadful rites which ArabMoslems assured me wereconducted there in the worship of Satan - including, they insisted, humansacrifice - but I must admit thatthere was nothing to offer the slightest intimation that it was currently usedfor such a purpose.I learned later that the Yezidis believed these waters flowed by a subterraneanriver across all Arabia,underneath the desert, from the miraculous spring of Zem-Zem in Mecca. Thefountain of Zem-Zem, like theKaaba with its black stone, was holy to the ancient idolatrous Arabs many yearsbefore Mecca became thesacred city of Islam. 405Whether or not the water source beneath the Shrine extends to Mecca, it isdoubtful that it reaches to“Schamballah (Carcosa)”, since Carcosa was a city invented by Ambrose Bierce forhis tale “AnInhabitant of Carcosa” and later adapted by Robert W. Chambers for The King inYellow.406There has been considerable debate among anthropologists as to whether theYezidi god ( Melek Taus,Taus Melek, or Taus-e Malak) is in fact the Satan of Judaic-Christian tradition.In preparation for her 1941anthropological study of the Yezidis, Peacock Angel, Ethel S. Drower asked aYezidi qawwal (religiousteacher) point blank about the Devil-worship rumors centered on Melek Taus. Heresponded:We do not believe, like Islam, that He is the Lord of Evil ( Sharr). He is thechief of the seven angels,and is one with Gabriel, who removes the soul from the human body when Azrael(the Hebrew angel ofdeath) comes for it. The evil in men’s hearts is not from Him, but fromthemselves. 407Confusion over the identity of Melek Taus arose in part because of the secrecyin which the Yezidishave traditionally held their two sacred books. This confusion persists in theSatanic Rituals, in which the405 Ibid., pages #319-321.406 Lovecraft, H.P. (Lin Carter Ed.), The Spawn of Cthulhu. New York: BallantineBooks, 1971, pages #92-97.407 Drower, Ethel S., Peacock Angel. London: John Murray, 1941, page #92.- 244 -names of the two books are interchanged. The al-Jalwa is properly translated asThe Book of theRevelation, while it is the other Yezidi book - Mashaf-a Resh - that is entitledThe Black Scripture. 408In 1967 anthropologist C.J. Edmonds completed a study on the Yezidi religiousculture for the RoyalAsiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Referring to the “Al-Jilwah textin the Daud as-Sáighmanuscript”, he observed that it remained unauthenticated. 409 R.A.S. scholarAlphonso Minganaconsidered the text to be a simple forgery, based upon his analysis of thegrammar and syntax of the “IsyaJoseph” version attributed to “Daoud Assaigh”. 410 [This version appears in theSatanic Rituals.]An authentic translation of the actual Book of the Revelation by Sheikh Shamsal-Din Abu Mohammedal-Hasan (ca. 1200 CE) is contained in Appendix #69. [While the Temple of Setpossesses a copy of theMashaf-a Resh ( Black Scripture) as well, a translation is not provided becauseof its excessive length andirrelevance to the Satanic Rituals per se.]At the end of the Satanic Rituals’ version of “Al-Jilwah” is a prose-poemattributed to “Shaitan”. Thisis actually an abridged version of a poem attributed to Sheikh Adi (?1070-1160CE), a complete andauthentic translation of which is contained in Appendix #70.The most “outrageous” case of second-layer deception in the Satanic Rituals waspropagated upon aninnocent public by myself - as author of the introductory essay on H.P.Lovecraft (Appendix #71) and ofthe “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” (Appendix #72) and the “Call to Cthulhu”(Appendix #73). The storybehind this section of the Satanic Rituals was published in the #13/May 1977issue of Nyctalops magazineand is reprinted here as Appendix #74. 411The two Satanic Baptismal ceremonies - one for adult Satanists [see Chapter #8and Appendix #20]and the other for children who are not actually members of the Church - wereboth original to the Churchof Satan. The children’s ceremony is also part of The Satanic Mass recording[see Chapter #3].At the conclusion of the Satanic Rituals there is a short epilogue entitled “TheUnknown Known”. Ittouches obliquely on Hans Hörbiger’s Welteislehre, or Doctrine of Eternal Ice,in which the history of theuniverse consists of alternating cycles of fire and ice. The “Wel”, as it wastermed, was popular in NaziGermany because of Adolf Hitler’s enthusiasm for Hörbiger, whom he called “theGerman Copernicus”.Anton LaVey, however, offers the theory in a social, not a cosmological context.The key number, hesuggests, is nine - the number of the Devil because it always “returns toitself” when subjected to basicmathematical computations. [For example: 9x3=27 and 2+7=9. 92=81 and 8+1=9.]History, says Anton, is divided into “Epochs” of 13,122 years. Each Epoch isdivided into nine“Ages” (1,458 years). Each Age consists of nine “Eras” (162 years). An Era isdivided into nine 18-year“Workings”. A Working consists of nine years of “action” followed by nine yearsof “reaction”, with themidpoint year being a “zenith of intensity” and the beginning and ending yearsbeing “Working Years”.The initial Working Year sees the generation of the Working; the final one itsultimate product.Whether or not there is any external basis for this theory of social evolution,it is intriguing to note thatthe history of the Church of Satan itself adhered to it. At the midpoint of themidyear of the “Working”begun in mid-1966, the Church went through a crisis which resulted in itsevolution into the Temple ofSet. And what of the final Working Year (1983 CE)? At the Wewelsburg Castle inWestphalia in October1982 CE, an appropriate Working was celebrated, the nature and results of whichare beyond the scope ofthis volume and are discussed in the companion volume to this history, TheTemple of Set .408 Edmonds, C.J., A Pilgrimage to Lalish.

One of hisremarks read:Mr. Lynn A. Norton: New member to my area. In his first letter he sent threearticles for Changes IV.They’ll be published in the next issue. 412They weren’t - Shai’s space was preempted by current events - but Norton went onto become aRegional Agent, and then first a Priest of Set and later a Master of the Temple.In Washington, D.C. Robert Ethel was also meeting regularly with five localSatanists, thoughNineveh’s ex-member John Shannonhouse had departed the area. 413 News wassomewhat slow in coming;Volume #I-1 of Ethel’s newsletter, The Devil’s Advocate, had been issued onJanuary 21 of 1972 - andVolume #I-2 would not be published until July 21 of 1973! [#I-1, said Etheldrily, “immediately fell intoobscurity”.]414 Now, in February of 1973, Ethel and Dale Seago had begun to talkabout a Fourth EasternConclave for Walpurgis in Washington.In San Francisco a bemused Anton LaVey considered an angry letter from LilithGrotto member JaySolomon, who was incensed over the Cloven Hoof’s favorable coverage of RonaldBarrett’s “TheMagician” occult shop. Forwarding the letter to me, Anton noted on the margin:“Sounds like Barrett hascommitted the crime of maintaining ideals and running a business at the sametime - a rare phenomenon inNew York.” To Solomon’s urging that the Hoof endorse the white-light “WarlockShop” across town,Anton responded: “We will not support, placate, nor credit those(Wicca-oriented) who play the Devil’sGame without taking His Name. It is unwise.” 415“Alessandra Erb,” wrote Diane LaVey to me, “said Barrett smiles like a jackal.No comment.” 416“Barrett does grin like a jackal,” I answered. “Wears an Anubis ring to boot.Don’t know whether hehowls at night, however.” 417In January Art Lyons came to Santa Barbara to lecture on “Violence and theCults” as part of an adulteducation (!) series. I had had no contact with Lyons since our briefcorrespondence following the412 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, January 8, VIII/1973.413 Letter, Robert Ethel to M.A. Aquino, January 29, VIII/1973.414 Ethel, Robert in The Devil’s Advocate #I-2, July 21, VIII/1973.415 LaVey, Anton, notation on letter, Jay Solomon to Cloven Hoof, December 20,VII/1972.416 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, VIII/1973. Erb was anex-Central Grotto II° who had just moved to New York.417 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, February 23, VIII/1973.- 246 -publication of his The Second Coming: Satanism in America in 1970,418 and now Iwondered whether hehad turned to sensationalizing at the expense of the Church of Satan (in whichhe was still a registered, ifinactive I°).Attending the lecture anonymously, I found that he mentioned the Church only inpassing, and notunfavorably. Nevertheless I did not introduce myself to him, assuming that hewould be surprised to read areview of his remarks in the next Cloven Hoof. 419I commenced that issue with “The Secrets of Life and Death” (Appendix #75),followed by essays ontherapy & sanity [by Charles Steenbarger] and ritual magic relative to actingtechnique [by MichaelMcQuown]. Canadian Regional Agent Stephen Hollander contributed an article onthe “spiritualenlightenment” phenomenon of Satanism, arguing that the conscious shedding ofthe “burden ofunreasonable guilt and fear” generates a euphoria similar to “revelation”.Anton LaVey’s essay for this Hoof proved to be one of the most fascinating [andrevealing] statementsof his personal philosophy. Titled “Erotic Crystallization Inertia (ECI)”, itadvanced the hypothesis thatmen and women who are surrounded by visual imagery remindful of the vitality oftheir youth - ratherthan the changed imagery of contemporary youth cultures - will live longer.He held up the example of the artist Reginald Marsh, painter of “the mostearthy, sweaty, and lustyexamples of humanity he could lay his eyes upon”. Marsh’s “lumpy women andpotbellied men” clashedwith the changing styles of the post-World War II period, said Anton, resultingin the artist’s gradualalienation from the “progress” around him. “I am not a man of this century,”said Marsh abruptly at a1954 symposium glorifying new directions in modern art; shortly thereafter hedied.“Change per se,” concluded Anton, “is not necessary to happiness. On thecontrary, the resistanceshown whenever change seems imminent would indicate that, if most people weregiven a chance,nothing would change.” 420At the time I didn’t attach too much attention to this concept. I understood it- or thought I did - in acomparatively superficial context. It was, I assumed, merely a Lesser Magicalcommentary on the“generation gap” phenomenon - valuable for manipulating and/or alleviatingtensions between young andold. A short time previously, however, I had witnessed a sight that should havealerted me to a radicallydifferent interpretation:After returning from New York City in mid-December of 1972, I accepted aninvitation from Antonand Diane to visit 6114 on Christmas Eve. I took the occasion to inquire if Imight take a series of color-slide photographs of the house, so that Satanists around the country might havethe opportunity to “tour”the Central Grotto by slideshow. The LaVeys graciously assented, and so I wentfrom room to room withKodak & flashbulbs.The famous chambers were all as I had last seen them - indeed much as they hadbeen when I had firstseen them on the occasion of the “Franciscan ashtray” lecture in 1969 [save forthe addition of newtreasures and trophies]. But when I descended the ladder from the mummy-case tothe Den of Iniquity, Isaw - and photographed - a strange and startling sight.The Den of Iniquity now had a permanent clientele. A sailor [in Navy“crackerjack” uniform] stood atthe bar, the front of his bell-bottoms opened to reveal a protruding, erectpenis. Leaning up against him,one hand hiking her dress up to her waist and the other tickling the back of thesailor’s neck, was awoman, apparently a prostitute. A short way along the bar a second woman, herdress also hiked to hergarter-belt, returned the advances of another man in a soldier’s uniform.Between these two couples,turning away from the bar, was a third woman, evidently from “higher” societyjudging by her moreelegant clothes and jewels. But this woman’s eyes were closed in an expressionof pain or shame. Over by418 See Chapter #10.419 Aquino, M.A. in Cloven Hoof, January-February VIII/1973.420 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, January-February VIII/1973.- 247 -the jukebox a young child sprawled on the floor, obviously [from his expression]drunk. Behind the barstood the bartender, wearing a Devil’s mask modeled after Anton LaVey’s own face[which I had found inSanta Barbara the previous Halloween and sent to him as a present].These strange beings were department-store mannequins. Or at least they hadbegun that way. Theirfacial features, as I saw now, had been reworked to create the expressions theynow wore, and the wood orplastic of the women’s inner thighs had been replaced with fabric andsponge-rubber to give them a morelifelike texture. The sailor’s protruding penis was, of course, a sex-shopdildo.At the time I thought they were merely novel and remarkable: a three-dimensionalAnton LaVey socialcommentary. After photographing them, I asked Anton if I could now record theadjoining Blue Room -the mirrored room containing the coffin on a central, raised platform. Its door,I saw, was shut.Here Anton demurred. The Blue Room was in a state of disrepair, he said, and wasnot now suitablefor viewing. I nodded, thought nothing more of it, and went back through theentrance of the Den ofIniquity towards the Council Chamber.What I had seen in the Den, as I now realize, were the first of Anton’s“androids” 421 - and a personalexperiment of his in ECI. In a post-1975 Cloven Hoof he would write:Why do I prefer androids to many “real” humans?Androids can be created, programmed, utilized exactly according to the master’swhims. They requireno energy-consuming interaction in order to salve a nonexistent ego. Yet eventhe semblance of an ego canbe built into an android via actions and words - but always according to theMaker’s requirements. They canbe shelved when they grow tiresome, brought back out when needed, modified inappearance, and destroyedwithout moral conscience.They are ideal companions. They never talk back, unless you want them to, yetyou can insult them toyour heart’s content. Insofar as work is concerned, that can be performed byeither non-humanoid machinesor humans of limited intelligence operating machines of greater intelligence.Androids offer splendid companionship when cast in the physical semblance ofhuman beings. And forall most people really have to say, they might as well say nothing. Essentiallythey are merely decorations ina room - humanoids to alleviate what might be construed as loneliness.422In 1927 Thea von Harbou wrote a novel entitled Metropolis, which her husbandFritz Langsubsequently made into a classic UFA motion picture. It is a story in whichhumans of limited intelligenceare slaves to machines of greater intelligence; and it is a story in which themagician Rotwang, a reclusewho lives in an ancient house with copper-red pentagrams on its doors, createsthe world’s most famousrobotrix:The being was, indubitably, a woman. In the soft garment which it wore stood abody, like the body of ayoung birch tree, swaying on feet set fast together. But, although it was awoman, it was not human. Thebody seemed as though made of crystal, through which the bones shone silver.Cold streamed from theglazen skin which did not contain a drop of blood. The being held its beautifulhands pressed against itsbreast, which was motionless, with a gesture of determination, almost ofdefiance.But the being had no face. The beautiful curve of the neck bore a lump ofcarelessly shaped mass. Theskull was bald, nose, lips, temples merely traced. Eyes, as though painted onclosed lids, stared unseeingly,with an expression of calm madness, at the man - who did not breathe…The being bowed. It stretched out a hand - a graceful, skeleton hand.Transparent skin was stretchedover the slender joints, which gleamed beneath it like dull silver. Fingers,snow-white and fleshless, openedlike the petals of a crystal lily.421 See Chapter #15.422 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, May-June XII/1977.- 248 -Joh Frederson laid his hand in it, feeling it, in the moment of contact, to beburnt by an unbearablecoldness. He wanted to push the being away from him, but the silver-crystalfingers held him fast.“Goodbye, Joh Frederson,” said the mass-head, in a voice full of a horribletenderness. “Give me a facesoon, Joh Frederson!”A soft, far-off voice laughed, as though the house were laughing in its sleep.423The electro-magical sequence in the 1927 film Metropolis in which the robotrixis given a face - whileenthroned below a great inverse pentagram - can never be forgotten by one whohas seen it. It inspiredAnton LaVey’s Elektrischen Vorspiele, and it set the precedent for countless“mad laboratory” scenes inlater cinema.While I have always thought of Metropolis and “Futura” the robotrix asfascinating and stimulatingcommentaries on creativity beyond organic humanity, it appears that AntonLaVey’s attitude was that ofthe magician Rotwang: that the ultimate android involved the subtraction ofqualities from organichumanity, the result being an “ideal companion”.The robotrix of Metropolis was given a beautiful face. Having no soul, however,she coldly ledhumanity towards self-destruction. “The mediator between brain and muscle mustbe the heart,” said Theavon Harbou.Lacking a heart - or a soul, or whatever else one might call the jewel ofindividual self-consciousness -a being is monstrous and alien. This statement was made even more powerfully,and tragically, by the“monster” in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein:I am malicious because I am miserable. If any being felt emotions of benevolencetowards me, I shouldreturn them, an hundred and an hundred fold. 424What is the difference between great sculpture and the “more lifelike” images inwax museums, savethat the former captures or at least suggests the soul of the subject while thelatter ignores it? Why is oneuneasy at the thought of being trapped in a wax museum (a theme of many horrormovies), while beinglocked into a hall of classical statuary inspires no fear at all? The soul doesnot thrive amidst “thingswhich ape a soul”, as Thomson stated it in The City of Dreadful Night.On Christmas Eve of 1972 it did not enter my mind that I had seen not awhimsical satire, but the firstmusicians of the Phibes Clockwork Wizards. Having acquired a powerful new Yamahaconcert organ for6114’s main ritual chamber, Anton had moved the original console down to the Denof Iniquity. Here hemight play amidst “splendid companionship”.Such things were far from my thoughts as, back in Santa Barbara, I receivedDiane LaVey’s commentson the January-February Hoof:The newsletter looks beautiful, as usual. Your lead article makes severalexcellent points, and we reallyare impressed with your style, which gets better with each issue. Needless tosay, Anton and I chortled whenwe read your review of P.E.I.B.’s book. 425Tomorrow I will be writing a letter from Anton to Michael Warnke in reply to arequest for informationfor a “report” Warnke sent us. He’s got more crust than a pie factory, as mydear ol’ Mum would say.Things are going well for us. I’ve just sent off a biographical sketch (thefirst in her lecture career) onKarla to Wofford College in South Carolina, where she will speak on March 6th.She’s really excited aboutit, especially since I suggested she use the fee she’ll receive to continue onto New York on the 7th. She willmeet Lilith Sinclair, some of the east coast membership, a number of Anton’sfriends and associates, andwill visit Avon Books.423 Von Harbou, Thea, Metropolis. New York: Ace Books, 1963, pages #52-53.424 Shelley, Mary, Frankenstein.425 Real Magic - see Chapters #19 and #20.- 249 -Anton has been asked to give several interviews on a movie [soon to be releasedon television] forwhich he supposedly acted as technical advisor. It’s called The Horror at 37,000Feet and is about a ghostloose aboard an airliner 37,000 feet up. He recalls nothing about the film, sounless he just talked with somewriter or producer casually about it quite awhile ago, we can only conclude thatthey think his name willhelp to promote the film. I intend to request a script or to ask for a privatescreening of the film, so he cansee whether or not he wants to take credit for “his” technical advice.426In March of 1972 San Diego’s Morris Cerullo World Evangelism decided to exploitthe “occultrevival” for its own publicity by fielding a mobile unit display called the“Witch Wagon” to travel aroundthe country. 427 Star attraction of the “Witch Wagon” was self-styled“ex-Satanic High Priest” MikeWarnke, now Born Again to Jesus. Warnke had written a paperback account on hisconversion, which Ihad reviewed in the Cloven Hoof:The Satan Seller by Mike Warnke (Plainfield, Logos, 1972). Warnke, you’llremember, is the starperformer on the so-called “Witch Wagon” that has been touring the country as anevangelistic come-ondevice. The famous Satanic cult of which he was “high priest” turns out to be aLos Angeles street gangwith no knowledge whatever of Black Magic. Upon going to San Francisco to seeDr. LaVey, Warnke nevermade it past the front door of the Central Grotto. It’s easy to see why such aperson would prostitute himselffor a two-bit Bible-jock road show. 428Anton LaVey’s letter to Warnke, sent under the “John M. Kincaid” pseudonym, wasstraight and to thepoint:Inasmuch as the copyright to the Satanic Bible is held by Anton Szandor LaVey,as administrator to Mr.LaVey’s affairs I must deny your request for reproduction rights. According toreports received you, incollaboration with a Mr. Morris Cerullo, have undertaken a vigorous campaignagainst all manner ofoccultic pursuit. It has also been brought to our attention that you havepublicly claimed association withMr. LaVey - a blatantly fallacious assertion.Were you capable of honest inquiry and fair judgment, you would know that theChurch of Satan and itsadherents are dedicated to law and order, personal freedom, and reverence forproductive and responsiblehuman beings. Instead you have lumped us together with all manner of drugfreaks, dropouts, andmalefactors, simply because we bear a name which is a convenient catchword foryour specious bid forfame. This is patently unjust, and you damned well know it.You are free to pursue your centuries-old ploy for a dubious form of recognition- that of witch-hunting- but not at our expense. Your modus operandi indicates that any material youwould extract from Mr.LaVey’s writings would be taken out of context and as a means to furtherdenigrate our movement.Your opinions are of course your own. As such you are constitutionally entitledto voice them. Anyspecific untrue and/or defamatory references to our legally charteredorganization, the Church of Satan (alsoregistered as the Satanic Church, Satanic Church of America, First Church ofSatan), will be referred to ourattorneys, and all principals involved in such libelous action prosecuted to thefullest extent of the law. 429426 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 4, VIII/1973.427 See Appendix #76.428 Aquino, M.A. in Cloven Hoof, January-February VIII/1973. In 1991 theInternal Revenue Service revoked Warnke Ministries’ tax-exemptstatus. Simultaneously the Chicago-based Christian magazine Cornerstone“concluded Warnke’s story [in The Satan Seller] was fabricated.The magazine interviewed people who knew Warnke during those 10 months of hislife who said that he wasn’t involved in Satanism.” - JayGrelen, Lexington Herald-Leader, Lexington, Kentucky, July 29, 1992.429 Letter, Anton LaVey (“John M. Kincaid”) to Mike Warnke, February 8,VIII/1973.- 250 -So much for Mike Warnke, the first in a series of “reformed Satanists” sensitiveto the publicity andfinancial opportunities to be found in such a stance. Now another note fromDiane: the 37,000-footmystery had been solved:That film The Horror at 37,000 Feet which had us puzzled is apparently as aresult of Anton’sconversation with the producer, with whom he worked three years ago on a Lancerepisode. We’ve read thescript; it’s pretty good. Anton won’t get credit on the screen as technicaladvisor (naturally!) but will in thepapers. His touches are most definitely there, however, for anyone who “knows”to see. I sure get sick ofseeing his brains picked, with no credit or $s given him! Oh, well … that’slife! 430Lancer was a western series on 20th Century Fox television whose themes involvedunusual or outréevents. In the episode in question Anton played the role of Satan, returning toclaim a ranch situated interritory belonging to him.431 For an unexplained reason, the episode whichincluded Anton was neveractually broadcast.The Horror at 37,000 Feet starred such notables as William Shatner and RoyThinnes, and was thestory of an ancient Druidic altar being transported to the United States aboarda Boeing 747. The altardidn’t like being transported and halted the airplane in mid-flight [at 37,000feet] until it was satisfied by asacrifice. The passengers resisted doing so until dawn - when the power of thealtar would fail. At the lastminute, however, Shatner (a disillusioned Catholic priest) sacrificed himself toit in order to gain trueknowledge of the supernatural. He was whirled away into the stratosphere withthe light of Understandingin his eyes. [No doubt this led to his getting mixed up with disreputablepersons like Jonathan Corbis.]There are no Church of Satan themes in Horror that I can detect. This is not tosay that Anton didn’tconceive the idea and suggest it; it is rather to say that the C/S never had anyparticular trouble withairborne altars, Druidic or otherwise. The jury is still out, I suppose, onwhether the real Druids werehuman-sacrificers or flower children.Meanwhile there was very real trouble with a Church of Satan altar in NewJersey. As recounted in theLilith Grotto’s newsletter:Spotswood, New Jersey, February 8: Today the Temple of the Flames was brokeninto by a person orpersons unknown. Interestingly enough, the only area in which anything wastouched was the altar. Thesandstone plaque of the dæmon Lilith was mutilated in a sexually significantmanner; the Priestess’ powersymbol was undamaged. The only item actually stolen was the Baphomet medallionof Priestess Sinclair.Nothing else was touched. Police have no leads at present, but an officersurmised that the nature of thedamage seemed to indicate that it was perpetrated by someone aware of theparticular significance of theitems. 432Diane LaVey commented to me:We are going to replace Lilith’s medallion for her. It was very nice of Shai toloan her his for a time. It’sreally terrible that she has had to put up with the difficulties she’sexperienced, after she has been sogracious with the people who come to her home. On Valentine’s Day her cat waskilled, perhaps hit by acar. It wasn’t visibly injured, save for the small trickle of blood at thecorner of its mouth. She felt prettybadly about it. It might not have anything to do with the other incident - justa cruel coincidence - but I’msure it didn’t do much to lift her spirits after the other thing. 433430 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 8, VIII/1973.431 A photograph of LaVey in the Lancer episode included in The Devil’s Avenger.432 Satan’s Spawn, Lilith Grotto, New York, January-February VIII/1973.433 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, VIII/1973.- 251 -Lilith had reported the vandalism to the police, of course, but it didn’t strikethem as very important. Itis perhaps instructive to contrast their interest in this case to theall-hands-on-deck atmosphere of theNorthglenn Incident434 or the DePalma murder. 435January’s Changes IV from Detroit brought an interesting commentary on theSatanic approach to lifeafter death, by Regional Agent Stephen Hollander from Canada:Immortality is obtained through fulfillment of the ego. The question thenbecomes: What form will thisimmortality take? Traditional religions have posited either translation to somesort of paradise or repeatedreincarnations until the individual becomes eligible for a perpetual state ofblissful unconsciousness. Bothof these ideas presuppose a dualism of body and “soul” which is rejected bySatanists. [This rejection,incidentally, is admirably supported by the logical method of concomitantvariation in a functionalrelationship.] In any case, nobody has come back from “the other side” to tellus that there is an afterlife.Nobody has come back to tell us that there is not; but, if there isn’t, hecouldn’t. The long and short of it isthat we must reject the idea of existence after death as conscious, self-awareentities.What then is the Satanic view of immortality? I suggest that it is that theramifications of the acts bywhich a person fulfills his ego constitute his immortality. In that senseAlexander the Great, for example,has attained immortality, as has Joseph Lister. This is supported, to an extent,by the “Book of Satan” III:9and V:10. In a larger sense, however, it is the totality of a person’s actions,together with their consequencesand the consequences of these consequences ad infinitum which determine anindividual’s eternal fate. If theperson’s actions are directed towards the fulfillment of his ego, then theeffect will be magnified in eachsucceeding generation. If, on the other hand, they were directed towards thedenial or repression of the egoin subservience to some external god or for any other reason, then the resultwill be a richly-deservedoblivion. 436I had been sufficiently interested in this topic to commence some research of myown. One result was“The Secrets of Life and Death” 437; another was an ultimately abortiveinvestigation into the then-novelpractice of cryonics, according to which a dying human can be “quick-frozen” foreventual thawing andreturn to life.During our automobile trip from Louisville to Fort Knox [for the visit to thePatton Museum], AntonLaVey and I had discussed the notion. He liked the idea and indeed stated thathe himself intended to becryonically frozen. I responded with doubts that the delicate human brain couldsurvive such treatmentwith its intelligence intact. Furthermore, I said, why should people of thefuture even want to revive old,diseased bodies? It is easier [and more fun] to produce fresh new ones, and ofcourse the world alreadyhas more animate human bodies than it can support.The literature of cryonics didn’t do much to alleviate my doubts - which arestill strong today. Morepractical and probable, I think, is exploration in the direction of cyborgtechnology - in whichdeteriorating components of the organic body are replaced bymechanical/electronic substitutes. If theegocentric consciousness in fact uses the physical body for a vehicle and is notitself organic, one couldtheoretically replace the entire body and brain in this fashion. 438Michael Grumboski was continuing his intermittent cosmologicaldiscussion-by-letter with DaleSeago. He found, as many of us had found, that Satanism and atheism wereultimately incompatible:434 See Chapter #11.435 See Appendix #64.436 Hollander, Stephen in Changes IV, Phœnix Grotto, Detroit, January-FebruaryVIII/1973.437 Appendix #75.438 Cf. As Man Becomes Machine: The Next Step in Evolution by David Rorvik (NewYork: Doubleday, 1978).- 252 -We believe that one cannot destroy matter - only change it. Why can’t athought-form live from thedawn of mankind until now, never losing but always using power? When anotherthought-pattern in synchwith its pattern happens along, it is absorbed and changes the intent of thisdawn-form.The Satan who was honored in the early years is the same power we command; themind vibes are thesame, but the entity is slightly changed in character to keep pace with theever-changing man. This Satandoesn’t need to think, as the group-mind generated by the Church of Satanprovides that function for it.As you said in your letter: “I think we have created ourselves a god.” Whetheror not it existed beforeus, waiting for someone to come around and give it a purpose, isn’t reallyimportant. The fact that it doesmind the store and carry out the Workings for the good of the whole isimportant. 439Dale Seago had also raised this topic with Margaret Wendall in San Jose, who inturn discussed it withJames and Dolores Stowe in Santa Cruz. The consensus appeared much the same, asWendall wrote toSeago:Do you mean by our “Patron” the Cosmic Intelligence? I think the Reverends Stoweagree with whatwe’ve discussed, but we keep it to ourselves (no mention on the radio, forexample). Do you have any timeto do any writing? An article on this would be interesting in the Hoof …440But everything in early 1973 was not, as H.G. Wells once called it [and as Antonenjoyed describingit], “big thinks”. Anton’s daughter Karla had made her public debut in 1972 witha lecture at theUniversity of Santa Clara and an interview with San Francisco City College’snewspaper. 441 Now she wasscheduled to fly east to a college in South Carolina, and I wrote to Dianesuggesting Dale Seago as escort/bodyguard. She responded:I have already spoken to Dale Seago about Karla’s lecture in South Carolina. Hecalled a couple of daysbefore your letter arrived, and I mentioned it to him then. He would be an idealescort for her. We havereceived a letter from him saying he is definitely planning on meeting herthere. We will feel better knowingDale is with her. Lilith Sinclair is also looking forward to meeting Karla andis planning to have a get-together for her with the Grotto members. Karla is really excited about theentire affair. 442Karla had picked a good time to go to New York, as the Lilith Grotto was soaringto new heights ofpublic attention and involvement. Lilith Sinclair wrote to me:The Lilith Grotto is presenting a lecture on the Church of Satan and itsphilosophy on March 3 at thePhiladelphia Ethical Society. We are then scheduled to give a lecture atColumbia University in New YorkCity towards the end of the month. Somewhere in between I’m supposed to go toBoston University inMassachusetts to lecture. And just last week I gave a lecture at BurlingtonCounty College in Pemberton,New Jersey. Things are going great guns here!We are all looking forward to Karla LaVey’s visit here. A dinner party isplanned, and we’re putting ourheads together to make her visit a most enjoyable one. 443The first account of Karla’s trip to the east came via Dale Seago’s report to“Lana Green”. Prior toKarla’s arrival, it seemed, Seago had been involved in one or two publicrelations enterprises himself:439 Letter, Michael Grumboski to L. Dale Seago, January 8, VIII/1973.440 Letter, Margaret Wendall to L. Dale Seago, February 28, VIII/1973.441 Appendix #77.442 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, VIII/1973.443 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, February 21, VIII/1973.- 253 -Much has happened since my last report. On 8 March I was called upon to “defendthe faith” in acourtroom. I was testifying for the prosecution in a General Court Martial, andthe defense attorneyattempted to discredit my testimony on the grounds that I had sworn to tell thetruth “so help me God”while, in reality, I am a Satanist. I don’t know how he found out about that,but it was no real surprise. Igave the judge a thorough explanation of our ethical standards and legal status,and made the lawyer looklike a complete fool.On the evening of 8 March I gave a lecture as a guest speaker at a sociologyclass at the Cherry PointCenter of East Carolina University, located in Havelock. I explained Satanismfrom both a religious and aphilosophical viewpoint, employing the charts Magister Aquino drew up for theCloven Hoof. The classlistened with enthusiasm and, including the question and answer period, I spokefor nearly an hour and ahalf. I have received a letter from one of the class members asking for moreinformation on the Church. Theteacher of the class told a colleague about it, with the result that I have nowbeen invited to give a lecture atEast Carolina University’s main campus in Greenville, North Carolina.On 12 March I received a letter from Mr. Raymond Somers, owner and generalmanager of RadioStation WHYZ in Greenville, South Carolina. My name, as I discovered later, wasgiven him by WoffordCollege. Mr. Somers would like me to appear on his talk show. I am agreeablebut, after this last trip, I willhave to insist that the station pay my travel expenses.And now a few words on Miss Karla LaVey’s visit to Wofford College. She was metat the airport byDivver Martin, the head of the school’s public relations department. Wediscovered after Miss LaVey’sarrival that Martin had scheduled her for a series of private interviews withvarious press men prior to herlecture. She was understandably irritated, as this was not in her contract andshe was not being paid for it.There were other things, as we later found: Her morning lecture was videotapedwithout her consent, andMartin had promised the local television station a brief interview with herafter the lecture without firstconsulting her.The lecture itself went smoothly enough until someone tried to exorcise theDevil. A few people in theaudience displayed open hostility, but these were mostly local citizens, notWofford students. The studentpopulation is 1,000; the auditorium seats 1,500. It was filled to capacity, withmany people standing in theback. There was even a little old woman, apparently senile, who actually came uponto the stage and beganpreaching. The incident seemed to be regarded more as comic relief than anythingelse by the audience, andMiss LaVey remained outwardly calm. On the whole her lecture was well received;the good faroutweighed the bad. Many people came up to us afterwards to apologize for thebehavior of the few hostileones.The afternoon talk session went very well except for the audience’spreoccupation with curses; MissLaVey was asked the same questions repeatedly. The informality of the sessionled to a relaxed atmosphere,however, and at the end of the hour she received a standing ovation. The campusbookstore, by the way,sold all its copies of the Satanic Bible by 1:00 PM that day.For my own part, I’m glad to have made the trip. It was a pleasure meeting MissLaVey, not so muchbecause she is the High Priest’s daughter as because she is a charming person inher own right. She is aCompleat Witch, and one can’t give higher praise than that. 444A behind-the-scenes account arrived from Diane LaVey, who then continued withsome interesting -and then some disturbing news:I don’t know yet how her lecture went today, but she liked Dale Seago very muchand was happy tohave him there with her. When she got off the plane, he was there to meet her,along with the campusactivities director and a reporter friend of his. They told her they hadarranged for interviews with four ofthe largest papers in North Carolina before the lecture! I told her to tell themshe’d hold a press conferencefor about 15 minutes following the lecture.444 Letter, L. Dale Seago to “Lana Green”, March 18, VIII/1973.- 254 -I know Karla, and if she were to give four separate interviews prior to hertalk, she not only would beterribly nervous, but she’d be burned out for her lecture. This is a very bigstep for her, and I don’t want anyundue pressure on her. I’m sure she’ll do fine. Curiously enough, she’s sure to!That’s Anton’s daughter!Next weekend we’re going to L.A. We will be meeting with Noah Dietrich, the manwho was HowardHughes’ right-hand man for 33 years and wrote the book Howard: The Amazing Mr.Hughes, from whichClifford Irving stole all his stuff for his phony book. Did we tell you we metDietrich last time we werethere? He’s really a nice man - and very interesting.Lately we’ve been trying to “get away from it all” more often. We think it willhelp us to keep a morepositive attitude towards the Church. Everything you read in my letter to ChuckSteenbarger445 was true butthe move to Sonoma County. And you are the only one who knows the truth aboutthe latter. We’re notcrying into our beer over things, but sometimes it gets pretty wild around here!Since you won’t be able tocome up and see the situation firsthand for awhile, you’ll just have to take ourword for it that we’re notover-dramatizing. It does keep one on one’s toes. Anton and I have had somepretty good target practicelately. 446As one drives along the “Sunset Strip” in Hollywood, one may catch a glimpse ofwhat seems to be anold stone castle on the cliffs behind it (at 1486 North Sweetzer Street). [Thisis the famous “Castle of theFairy Lady”, in which Mrs. Hersee Moody Carson gave holiday parties forunderprivileged childrenduring the 1940s.447 ] Enthralled with this Gothic wonder, the LaVeys had drivenup to it one afternoon tosightsee - whereupon they were greeted by its present owner, the aforementionedMr. Dietrich. He did notbecome a member of the Church of Satan, but he was placed permanently on theCloven Hoof’s mailinglist.The final paragraph of Diane’s letter testifies to the continuing and apparentlygrowing danger ofliving at the Devil’s announced street address on Earth. Despite thebarbed-wire-topped fence, 6114California Street was still vulnerable to cans of paint, other thrown objects,and gunshots. [Diane’sreference to “target practice” refers, I recall, to the LaVeys’ occasional - andcareful - use of a pellet or BBgun to discourage loiterers or vandals.] Anton’s cherished Jaguar sedan was safein 6114’s garage, but hisOldsmobile Toronado and Buick Limited [both identifiable to marauders by theirVAMPYR andZAMZAM license plates and black finishes] were regularly vandalized.Since barricades had not solved the problem [and in fact probably constitutedmore of a challenge tothugs], the LaVeys decided to create the impression that they no longer lived at6114, and that the buildingitself had been stripped of all Satanic memorabilia. Soon Diane sent me the new“cover story” for theCloven Hoof, remarking:Enclosed is a notice Anton wants placed in the current Hoof. Its importance isquite timely, so even if itmeans taking something out in order to make room for it, we’d appreciate yourdoing so. Thisannouncement will allow us to employ the tactic of “don’t call us - we’ll callyou”. Of course we’llwelcome someone like Lilith Sinclair when she comes to S.F. this summer. But inview of the current socialclimate, we feel this measure is necessary in order to protect both the Churchproperty and our family. Weare keeping in mind that many nonmembers now read the Hoof, so it will help inthat regard too. 448With their “departure” from 6114 California Street - a front which persistedpermanently - the LaVeysadopted a variety of mailing addresses, ranging from Beverly Hills to Amsterdam.My own post office boxin Santa Barbara was added to the “estates” under the distinguished pseudonym of“Villa Moreno”. I445 See Chapter #25.446 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 15, VIII/1973.447 Lamparski, op. cit., page #26.448 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 17, VIII/1973.- 255 -detected a good story behind the title and didn’t bypass the opportunity to askfor it. Diane’s responsecame shortly, together with more news from the east:Karla returned from her trip Sunday night and hasn’t stopped talking about ityet. Did I tell you thatWofford is an all-male college? She enjoyed visiting with Dale Seago and,judging from his latest Agent’sreport, he was quite taken with her.She and Lilith really hit it off, comparing notes on make-up techniques,experiences with regard to theirrespective roles as Compleat Witches and spokeswomen for the Church. She had alucky break with regardto lodgings: We had her booked at the Barbizon Hotel for Women, thinking it tobe a good, safe place for ayoung girl new to the city. When she got there, she found her room was littlemore than a cubicle with barson the windows.Lilith came up with the suggestion that she stay at a member’s place inGreenwich Village, just twoblocks away from “The Magician”. The member, Linda Stanton, was staying at afriend’s house, recoveringfrom an operation. She had entrusted her apartment to Stuart Levine during herabsence. So Karla had avery convenient and homey place to stay; she loved it.All the members were very hospitable to her and seemed to genuinely enjoy beingwith her. Lilith,Stuart Levine, Ronald Barrett, and Michael McQuown all met her at the airportand took her to dinner thesecond night she was there. Stuart Levine took her all over - from a ride on theStaten Island Ferry to theEmpire State Building. She attended a Grotto meeting at Lilith’s Saturday nightand was most favorablyimpressed with her flair for ceremonial magic.All in all she had a great time and struck up a very warm friendship withLilith. They have decided thatthey are both quite a lot the same personality type.In answer to your question regarding the Villa Moreno, Anton asked me to relatethe following to you:In this instance it means “the villa of darkness”, or more literally “the villaof the man of darkness” -“Moreno” as a surname meaning “dark man” or “descendent of Moreno (black)”.The Spanish origin relates to “Marrano”, or the Sephardim whence came the likesof Torquemada [andhis victims!]. The Spanish (Sephardic) etymology of “Moreno” stems from thetribe of Israel whereby“Moreno” in Hebrew means “the Master”. Hence “Villa Moreno” can be interpretedas “Villa of Darkness”or even more archaically as “Villa of the Master”, or combining ancient Hebrewwith the latter SephardicSpanish: “Villa of the Master of Darkness”. Incidentally the words “Moor”,“Moorish”, etc. are of the sameroot.For the record, Somerset Maugham (a compleat Satanist) called his place on theFrench riviera the“Villa Mauresque” - and even had the sigil of the Nine Unknown Men displayedover the entrance. Willshow you photos of same when you visit next. T’would weaken the namephonetically to use correctmodern Spanish grammar and make it “Villa de la Moreno” or “Villa de Moreno”.Last night we went to a private screening of a new film starring Sue Lyon. It’scalled Tarots. Don’t seeit; it’s lousy! The evening was not a total loss, though, because Fritz Leiberwas there. He’s moved to SanFrancisco, so we will be getting together with him after we get back from L.A.Anton was acquainted withhim several years ago, around the time he (Anton) was seeing quite a lot ofClark Ashton Smith. Mr. Leiberseemed very happy to rekindle the friendship, so we’re looking forward to seeinghim again. 449Somerset Maugham is best known to occultists as the author of The Magician, anovel whose centralcharacter was modeled after Aleister Crowley. There was little love lost betweenMaugham and Crowley,as Maugham later recounted:Soon after my arrival [in Paris in 1903], Gerald Kelly took me to a restaurantcalled Le Chat Blanc inthe Rue d’Odessa, where a number of artists were in the habit of dining. One ofthese casual visitors wasAleister Crowley. I took an immediate dislike to him, but he interested andamused me. He was a great449 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 21, VIII/1973.- 256 -talker, and he talked uncommonly well. He was a liar and unbecomingly boastful,but the odd thing was thathe had actually done some of the things he boasted of. 450Aleister Crowley’s account of Maugham was equally merciless:I liked Maugham well enough personally, though many people resent a curioustrick which he has ofsaying spiteful things about everybody. I always feel that he, like myself,makes such remarks withoutmalice, for the sake of their cleverness. I was not in the least offended by theattempts of The Magician torepresent me as, in many ways, the most atrocious scoundrel, for he had donemore than justice to thequalities of which I was proud; and despite himself he had been compelled, likeBalaam, to prophesyconcerning me. He attributed to me certain characteristics which he meant torepresent as abominable, butwere actually superb. 451Crowley described Maugham as completely ignorant of magic, and Maugham agreeswith this:As I read The Magician, I wondered how on earth I could have come by all thematerial concerning theBlack Arts which I wrote of. I must have spent days and days reading in thelibrary of the BritishMuseum. 452Crowley’s account differs:I wrote an article for Vanity Fair in which I disclosed the method by which TheMagician had beenmanufactured and gave parallel passages [from plagiarized works]. Frank Harriswould not believe that Iwas serious. He swore I must be making it up. He could not believe that any manwould have theimpudence to publish such strings of plagiarism. I had to bring a little libraryround to the office to provemy proposition, and Harris sat and stared, and gasped like a fish at each freshoutrage.453The point in all this is simply that Somerset Maugham himself was not aninitiate or practitioner of theBlack Arts, and that his personal sigil (appearing on the spine of his books andalso sold as a simple “goodluck” amulet by the Church of Satan before its 1973 promotion to “sigil of theNine Unknown Men”) wasnot indicative of anything esoteric. 454It is amusingly ironic that Diane should have mentioned Fritz Leiber in the samebreath as SomersetMaugham, because Leiber’s 1977 novel Our Lady of Darkness uses Anton LaVey asthe model for itssinister magician de Castries455 in much the same fashion as Maugham usedCrowley for the character ofOliver Haddo. 456It was now time for another Cloven Hoof, and, after being asked innumerabletimes why the EnochianKeys were called by that name, I decided to write something on the subject. Theresult - “Those Who SeekShall Find” 457 - rather got off the track, since one thought led to another,and by the time I was finishedwith it the no-doubt bewildered reader had been taken on a surprise detourthrough Egypt and Atlantis!450 Maugham, Somerset, Preface to The Magician. New York: Penguin Books, 1967,pages #6-7.451 Crowley, Aleister, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley. New York: Hill &Wang, 1969, page #571.452 Maugham, op. cit. , page #9.453 Crowley, op. cit. , pages #571-572.454 Cloven Hoof, November V/1970.455 See Chapter #20.456 Leiber, Fritz, Our Lady of Darkness. New York: Berkeley, 1977.457 Appendix #78.- 257 -In the same issue I put together an article on Wilhelm Reich458 , whose name hadbeen brought to myattention via letters from readers following the appearance of “The Secrets ofLife and Death”. Dianewrote:Anton said to thank you for doing such a fine job on the lead article [onEnoch]. He said the subject hadbeen on his list for quite some time, and he never seemed to get around to it.It is one that all occultists havebeen avoiding for far too long. We liked the way you handled the subject andthought your opening waspriceless. It will be invaluable to members who wish to seriously pursue theBlack Arts. I’ve had an extra25 copies printed so that we’ll have enough extras to send to people who count -now and in the future.Oh, yes - Anton also said that the piece on Reich was a fine introduction to theman for anyone whowants to investigate his life and career. 459A few months earlier an Army chaplain had written 6114 requesting permission toquote from theSatanic Bible for a research paper at the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School.Anton had given hisapproval providing that a draft of the paper be sent to the Church of Satan, andnow the paper arrived. TheLaVeys sent it to me for response, and the response grew to the proportions ofan official policy statementconcerning the Church of Satan’s relationship to the military. 460 Dianecommented as follows:Your letter to Chaplain Cecil Lewis was excellent. I’m glad you called him onhis statement “[AntonLaVey’s] logic is interesting if not sound”. You are right, of course, in sayingthat the way it stands it’spropaganda, not criticism. And besides, if we wanted to be nasty about it, wecould curtail the effectivenessof his paper considerably by telling him: “If you’re going to be that way aboutit, you can’t quote from theSatanic Bible.”We also liked your closing comments regarding the Church’s official positionconcerning the military ingeneral and the chaplain’s role in particular. Your final paragraph left littleto his imagination in case hewondered how we regard the present crop of chaplains!Diane closed with a glimpse of LaVey family life:Zeena has been quite sane and dull for the last couple of years, but now she’sbeginning to make drylittle comments that simply floor me. Today at the grocery store she announcedto the counter man, quiteout of the blue, that her teacher thinks she’s quite attractive. The man said,“Oh, yeah, I bet she thinksyou’re a real gorgeous jewel,” to which Zeena replied, “Yes, she said that too!”Tonight, after criticallyviewing a sketch of Anton’s (a man drinking a bottle of beer and scratching hisprivates), she said, “Really!Can’t you ever draw anything sophisticated?” 461In April (Friday the 13th) Dale Seago sent another report to “Lana Green”, oncemore evidencing thedry wit which was to become a trademark of his:I appeared on Radio Station WHYZ [in Greenville, South Carolina] on 2 April. Theshow was, in myopinion, a definite success. Having charmed the manager, the rest was fairlyeasy. Many callers, naturally,disagreed with me, but no one became abusive. The majority of the questionsasked were oriented towardsour philosophy and beliefs rather than sex and rituals. I was able to thoroughlyexplain our basic beliefs andour concepts of magic and of Satan. This apparently bothered some of theChristian members of theaudience. One caller asked: “If you don’t believe in the Bible, God, or theDevil - at least as we see them -458 Appendix #79.459 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 28, VIII/1973.460 Appendix #80.461 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 3, VIII/1973.- 258 -where do the Christians fit into your scheme of things? Where does that leaveus?” “Nowhere,” I toldhim. 462Coincidentally Seago had been looking into his Irish ancestry, and about a weeklater he raised thesubject to me in a letter:Have you ever taken a close look at the ancient Gælic gods and heroes? I can’trefer you to any bookson the subject, as it was 5 years or so ago when I made my own study, and I’vehad nothing to do with thematter since then. There is some really Lovecraftian stuff for you.Take the Irish hero Cuchulainn, for example. He was the son of Lugh (the Sungod) and a mortalwoman, a great warrior and all that; but once I came across a description ofhim: pretty horrible anddefinitely non-human. He also had a habit of changing his appearance whenenraged, which made thingsconsiderably worse. He apparently liked blood too, as human sacrifices weregiven to his image inprehistoric Ireland.I remember something about deep or even bottomless shafts.The general impression I got of my ancestors of those days was that theirmentality and outlook andattitudes were almost totally alien to humanity as we conceive it today. Itaffected me so profoundly that Ihad a couple of dreams, not entirely pleasant, about those times. 463Dale’s account brought to mind a story of Robert E. Howard’s that I had read:“The Children of theNight”. First published in the April-May 1931 issue of Weird Tales, “Children”told the story of a moderngentleman who, when knocked unconscious, mentally returns to a neolithic timewhen he was a Conan-like warrior. The story had stuck in my mind because one of the gentleman’smodern-day friends waseditor of an outré publication called The Cloven Hoof! 464 To Seago I responded:Ireland has not been one of my specialties, but I found it interesting to readthat you have found someLovecraftian implications in its folklore. HPL may well have read some Irishhistory. To quote Giraldus Cambrensis, agentleman who wrote about Ireland shortly after that country’s conquest by theNormans:“There is a lake in Ulster containing an island divided into two parts. In oneof these stands a church of especialsanctity, and it is most agreeable and delightful, as well as beyond measureglorious for the visitations of Angels andthe multitude of the saints who visibly frequent it.“The other part, being covered with rugged crags, is reported to be the resortof Devils only, and to be almostalways the theatre on which crowds of evil spirits visibly perform their rites.This part of the island contains nine pits,and should anyone perchance venture to spend the night in one of them (which hasbeen done, we know, at times bycertain rash men), he is immediately seized by the malignant spirits, who soseverely torture him during the wholenight, inflicting upon him such unutterable sufferings by fire and water, andother torments of various kinds, that whenmorning comes scarcely any spark of life is found left in his wretched body. Itis said that anyone who has oncesubmitted to these torments as a penance imposed upon him, will not afterwardsundergo the pains of Hell, unless he"},{"pageContent":"commit some sin of a deeper dye.” 465 [index_split_010.html#p258]462 Letter, L.

Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, April 23, VIII/1973.464 I checked with Anton, but he had been ignorant of the Howard story whennaming the Church of Satan’s newsletter.465 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, April 29, VIII/1973.[index-259_1.jpg]- 259 -Sammy Davis, Jr. was born in 1926 and at the age of 4 was learning dancing fromBill “Bojangles”Robinson. His father and uncle introduced him to show business as one of theWill Mastin Trio, and whenthe two elder men retired, Sammy went on to become one of the world’s most notedsingers, actors, andentertainers.I had never seen him perform - other than on occasional television variety showsand in motionpictures - so it was with a certain curiosity that I switched on “the box” inFebruary of 1972 to see himportray a devil. Not the Devil - who was played by Christopher Lee - but alower-level dæmon who washard-pressed to obtain his first soul from Earthbound humanity. Sammy, itseemed, liked people too muchto trick them or trap them.His assigned victim, Jack Klugman, felt sorry for Sammy after the dæmonconfessed his inability toexploit Klugman’s various shortcomings. Klugman ran around San Francisco (wherethe TV movie wassituated) trying to find his fiend/ friend, and at that point I began to paymore attention to the show. A fewdays later I recounted my impressions to Anton LaVey:In her last letter Diane asked if I would clip out the T.V. Guide “close-up” forThe Horror at 37,000Feet. It was indeed quite a show!Also enclosed is the regular listing for a show that was on NBC Wednesday nightcalled Poor Devil. Icertainly hope you happened to see it, as it was fantastic. Sammy Davis and allthe other devils woreinverse-pentagram neck medallions, and Christopher Lee sat at an imposing deskin front of a giganticinverse pentagram. The show - a pilot for a new series - was filmed on locationin San Francisco. Halfwaythrough the episode, Jack Klugman - who was trying to get in touch with Sammy -rushed to his phone andsaid, “I’ll call the Church of Satan downtown. They’ll know how to contact him!”In short, the show was beautifully done - and was a magnificent commercial forthe Church. Since it isthe pilot for a new series, I recommend we do something for it.Here is one idea: Either you or I could contact Sammy Davis personally andinvite him to accept anhonorary degree of Warlock in the Church of Satan. This could be done eitherpublicly or privately. Ifpublicly, it would be an ad for the series and an ad for the Church at the sametime. If privately, it would bean expression of appreciation to Mr. Davis for the sensitive and positive mannerin which he portrayed adevil and represented Satanism. Something like that might also be an opening foran Anton Szandor LaVeyguest appearance on the series, or an episode shot at 6114 California Street.466At the time there was no particular policy concerning honorary memberships inthe Church of Satan.Since the I° denoted someone in an apprentice state, however, I felt that anhonorary membership wouldbest be conferred at the II° level - carrying as it did the implication of“full” membership in the Church.Diane LaVey answered:466 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, February 16, VIII/1973.- 260 -I saw Poor Devil and agree that it was a beaut! Anton missed it, but I told himall about it. I almost felloff my chair when Jack Klugman said “I’ll call the Church of Satan downtown”. Iloved the flame effectaround the upper periphery of the room in Hell where Sammy Davis met with thevillains of the past.Christopher Lee was perfect as Lucifer. And I don’t think the message at the endwas far afield from whatwe believe. Wonder what Mr. Davis will think about being a black, Jewish,Satanic Warlock!467And on the same day another letter arrived from Anton himself:I didn’t see Poor Devil, but Diane and a couple of others told me about it. Ithink your idea to makeSammy Davis an honorary Warlock is an excellent one. Probably the best way toapproach the matter is foryou to write an initial letter asking him if he’s interested in accepting thedegree, and, if so, whetherpublicly or privately. Then if we get a positive response, I could write him apersonal letter with thecertificate and amulet enclosed. It will be interesting to see his reaction.We look forward to your visit with us in the near future. I have no end ofthings to show you from myfiles. I also have a top secret project to discuss with you - something which,if I ever get a chance toimplement it - could create a new industry on a par with Ford Motors. Othershave toyed with and writtenabout the basic device, but none, to my knowledge, has proposed as complete aplan as mine. 468[The “top secret project” involved Anton’s androids, discussed in Chapter #23and elsewhere.] I wroteDavis regarding the honorary membership, and in March his answer reached me:I would be most happy to accept your honorary membership, and I am pleased tolearn that no one wasoffended by our recent film Poor Devil. As I’ll be performing in Vegas at theSands Hotel from now untilApril 8th, perhaps you can arrange to present your award to me when I’m at theSan Carlos Circle StarTheater during April 10-16. Once again, my thanks.Peace and love,Sammy Davis, Jr. 469I forwarded his letter to San Francisco with a good deal of pleasure, addingthat I would like to be inthe audience when Anton made the presentation. When Diane’s next letter arrived,however, it appeared adifferent scenario was in order:Anton was particularly pleased to learn that if the presentation can be arrangedfor the 13th or 14th ofnext month, you’ll be able to attend. Matter of fact, he wants you to make thepresentation, if it turns outwe’re reading Mr. Davis correctly about the on-stage acceptance.The plan is this: You would present the certificate and deliver a briefpresentation speech. Then theannouncer would say something about Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church ofSatan, being in theaudience. He would stand up, take a bow [or make a nice gesture or comment inMr. Davis’ direction], andsit back down.You get the picture: You would be giving the degree on behalf of the Church ofSatan - theorganization, not Anton LaVey. We don’t want it to appear to either Mr. Davis orthe audience that it is justa bid for publicity [for Anton LaVey, who, “as everyone knows”, is just a bigham and publicity hound.Betcha Sammy Davis wouldn’t mind keeping the spotlight to himself either.]The less we push, the better Mr. Davis’ opinion of us will be. Of course we willinvite him to come outto 6114 after the show if he has the time. If so, we can count on having onemore good spokesman for the467 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, VIII/1973.468 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, VIII/1973.469 Letter, Sammy Davis, Jr. to M.A. Aquino, March 17, 1973.- 261 -C/S. I’ve never seen it fail … except once: Sam Brody! We should definitely tryfor the 13th, as Antonpointed out that it is a Friday!470What subsequently took place is recounted in one of the periodic bulletins Isent to the Priesthood inthe eastern United States (which at the time I continued to supervise for theChurch despite my relocationto the west coast). In the Walpurgis VIII issue I wrote:During the weekend of Friday the 13th, I traveled to San Francisco. A number ofthe LaVeys’ closepersonal friends had scheduled a surprise party in honor of the High Priest’srecent birthday, and DianeLaVey had selected an extraordinarily authentic Moroccan restaurant - theMarrakech - as a suitable site. Itwas a very successful celebration, and Dr. LaVey acknowledged it had been theonly occasion in recentyears when he had been caught unawares of the plot.24 hours earlier - on Friday evening - I went down the San Francisco peninsulato the San Carlos CircleStar Theater, a vast indoor amphitheater with a central, revolving stage. Withme was Karla LaVey, and wemade the trip for the purpose of presenting a II° certificate, medallion, andcard to Sammy Davis, Jr. Hiskind and humorous portrayal of Satanism in the recent television movie PoorDevil had prompted theCouncil to approve this award, and its presentation was scheduled for thearrival of his show in the BayArea.Needless to say, Mr. Davis was delighted with the recognition, and he made it apoint to wear his II°Baphomet medallion on stage for the length of his entire show that evening to asellout crowd. Afterwardswe were his guests for supper, and I talked with him at length about hislong-standing interest in the occult.It was not by accident that the Church of Satan was mentioned by name in PoorDevil.Unfortunately there is a sad postscript to the movie. As you may know, it wasoriginally intended to bea pilot for a weekly television series this coming fall. A few weeks ago,however, Mr. Davis was contactedby N.B.C. and informed that it would not be possible to proceed with the plans.Although Poor Devil was asmash success in the eyes of the public, there was a massive deluge of protestmail from the establishedreligious institutions of the country.Nothing in the film was the least bit derogatory to other religions, but thevery portrayal of Satanism assomething “decent” was the red flag to the bull. It came as bitter news to Mr.Davis, his costar ChristopherLee, and ourselves. Yet we might have expected something like this to happen. Itis just one more reasonwhy we must work towards a day when it does not. 471The presentation at the Circle Star Theater was my first personal contact with amajor Hollywoodpersonality, and I had expected a pompous, affected, “court” atmosphere. Karlaand I were surprised tofind everyone friendly and unassuming backstage - and Sammy Davis himself aspolite and earnest ascould be imagined.The original idea of the presentation as a simple gesture of appreciation - tobe “accomplished andfiled” by both the Church and Sammy - began to seem quite shortsighted. Here wassomeone who wasgenuinely interested in Satanism - and not just in its public image, but in thedeeper philosophies andconcepts involved.On the other hand, Sammy Davis was one of the world’s “celebrity Jews”.While I was pondering this odd situation in Santa Barbara in May, Anton LaVeyessayed his own firstformal contact with Sammy via letter:I trust by now you have returned from your recent tour and have had a bit of abreather. First off, I wantto thank you for the courtesy you and your staff extended to my daughter, Karla,and aide, Michael Aquino,when you were at the Circle Star. Having long admired you both as a uniqueindividual and an470 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 28, VIII/1973.471 Aquino, Michael, “Memoranda for the Priesthood of Mendes E/L/SZZ”, April 30,VIII/1973.- 262 -accomplished artist, my preconceptions were more than amplified by Karla’s andMike’s glowing accountof their meeting with you.I should like to meet you when your schedule permits. Next time you are in theSan Francisco area,perhaps we can unlock the old Church of Satan headquarters [we’ve had toliterally fortify it from curiosityseekers] and give you a cook’s tour, so to speak. My wife and I spend a gooddeal of time in the L.A. areaand are quite familiar with Summit Drive; in fact we recently inspected the oldBarrymore place, which, asyou probably know, is presently up for sale. On our return we drove by youraddress and were sorelytempted to announce ourselves to your pleasant young sentry, but, protocoltaking precedence, moved on.It is an honor having you with us; your avowed code of living is about asSatanic as one could find -and your Duesenberg is something else! I had a 1934 SJ which I regretfully soldwhen married to my firstwife472; but Diane, who has been with me eleven years, has forced me to hang onto our ’37 Cord,temptation to barter notwithstanding.My most Infernal blessings for your continued triumphs!473A copy of this pleasant pomposity [well, why not?] arrived in my mailboxtogether with a more to-the-point cover note from Diane: “Just got back from So. Calif late last night.Good, productive trip. Phew!Will tell you more about it later. Stopped by S. Davis’ house and spooked theuniformed guard.” 474Unfortunately the trip wasn’t quite so productive as Diane had hoped. A few dayslater she wrote:I trust this letter finds you in better spirits than I’m in about now. I’ve justdiscovered that I took 3 rollsof film at the wrong film speed setting. Judgment has been passed [Anton keepssaying: How could youhave forgotten - you’re going to have 3 rolls of black negatives], but I have towait out a painful 4 or 5 daysuntil I get the prints back to see just how severe my sentence will be. On therolls were private documentsfrom Will Fowler’s files, Marilyn Monroe’s grave, Anton standing in front of MayMann’s house makingthe Sign of the Horns while wearing a jaunty derby instead of “Devil horns”,Zeena’s trip to Disneylandwith us, and about 20 shots of Karla for publicity photos for her agency inBoston. Think I’ll go eatworms…475Two of the people around Sammy Davis who had shown Karla and myself not only thegreatestcourtesy but also an unusual interest in Satanism on their own were Sammy’s LosAngeles-based publicrelations chief David Steinberg and his Road Manager Murphy Bennett. Both hadasked for copies of theSatanic Bible and Satanic Rituals, which I mailed to them from Santa Barbara.Now, after sympathizingwith Diane over her photographic mishap, I suggested that these two individualsbe added to the ClovenHoof mailing list [without honorary membership]. She responded:Go ahead and put Mr. Steinberg on the mailing list, but Anton thinks we ought toleave the roadmanager off. He feels that if we make it appear as though we just casually puteveryone on the list whowants to be there, it will appear that we do the same thing with everyone wemeet. Thus less importancewill be placed upon those we do so honor. Besides, celebrities change roadmanagers so often that inanother couple of months there might be a new one, and then the old one would begetting the Hoof. 476472 Anton’s ownership of an expensive, classic Duesenberg during the “LostWeekend” era of his life is improbable, but he did later acquirethe 1937 Cord.473 Letter, Anton LaVey to Sammy Davis, Jr., May 22, VIII/1973.474 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 16, VIII/1973.475 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 18, VIII/1973.476 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 31, VIII/1973.- 263 -A few days later, however, Anton LaVey had second thoughts - not only about myenthusiasm for andtrust in Sammy Davis’ associates, but about the distance at which Sammy himselfshould be kept from the“organizational” Church of Satan:I have just had a talk with the Man downstairs, who informs me that I shouldtake my Devil-son asidefor a few moments and discuss certain machinations of the human jungle.You must read what I write with the knowledge that it is because you havefulfilled an assignment sowell that the following is necessary. I will not mince words, but say it like itis, however cynical ordisillusioning it may seem. I have spoken to friends in Hollywood who havesubstantiated His firstrevelations. Here goes:Sammy Davis is all for us. In fact so much so that your fine presentation andviability has caused hisimmediate aides no little consternation. When Sammy told you to “tell theworld”, he meant it.When I told you “don’t”, it was not because of concern for Sammy’s image, anymore than he wasconcerned for his image. It was because - and this may seem paradoxical - I wantour members to be thelast to know. Why? Because when a little guy can boast of knowing a big guy, itnever sets well, oftenbackfires into simple name-dropping, and invariably lessens the impact of therevelation, reducing it [for thelistener] to possible wishful thinking. If our members could crow about Sammy’smembership, this wouldhappen.If I “leak” such information out to select persons [media included], it comes asa scoop from anestablished quotable source and becomes a “juicy tidbit”. Then it finally getsback to the membership, whooften think nothing much is happening, and sets them on their ears, Priesthoodincluded. Those who mightbe prone to sour grapes are then given something to put in their pipes - andjust watch them smoke!This, of course, is even more galling to defectors and detractors. With eachsuch revelation of aprestigious nature that emanates from outside the Church, those who havefoolishly left us wish they hadn’t.The type of “leakage” of which I speak is told with the request that it not berepeated; and, sure enough,it will be. One never tells anyone anything that he does not expect to berepeated.Please don’t place all your faith in III° infallibility, for as a military manyou are aware of the often-experienced treacheries throughout history perpetrated by generals. This is whyI have built the bulwark ofthe Church upon the Order - who have no collective axe to grind, seldom knoweach other or engage inChurch activities per se, yet give the Church its real power. I will explainmore fully when I see you, for thetime has certainly come. 477When I said that you fulfilled your assignment in charming Sammy, as I knew youwould, I wasexpecting exactly what your last two communiqués [one by phone, the other byyour letter copies] of theDavis meeting contained. I won’t waste time regaling you of my own pastexperiences paralleling thepresent situation. Suffice it to say I know the modus operandi of PR people. Ialso know their Achilles’ heel.You hit it but didn’t know it.Mr. Steinberg is able to coo over you and the Church because the security of hisjob requires him to dojust that with anyone who elicits Sammy’s unabashed enthusiasm. He knows betterthan to attack hisemployer’s emotional needs, for to do so would cost him his job.He is also a “professional Jew” and resents usurpation of his influence. Hencehis profound relief whenyou told him of our decision to play down Sammy’s membership. Until you easedhis mind, you really hadhim worried. His interest is to “keep on top” of our contacts with Sammy.True, he might like to dabble in Satanism, but he is still dedicated to hisfaith (PR, reinforced withJudaism) and wishes Sammy to remain equally dedicated to his (Judaism). He feelsthat his and Sammy’savowed religion will nullify any chance of his meal ticket being revoked. He iswrong, though. Sammy justmight have discovered an emotion surging to the surface which would transcendhis previous vows withoutplacing him in jeopardy at all.477 Here Anton is referring to the Order of the Trapezoid as a nebulous “innercircle of confidants” unconnected with the Church of Satan’sinitiatory structure. In the earlier days of the Church it had been synonymouswith the Priesthood of Mendes III°+ [see Chapter #6, Note #25].But by 1973 Anton, now somewhat apprehensive about the Priesthood, had begun touse this Order name in this “mysterious” fashion.- 264 -Many persons of Jewish backgrounds are dedicated Satanists and within the Order.Mr. Steinberg,however, is simply protecting his own nest, for the very Satanists who controlthe entertainment industryare largely of Jewish background.I can say with confidence that Sammy Davis is Sammy Davis’ own boss if given theopportunity. He isa phenomenal person who will always make it - as a Satanist or as a Quaker.I am not suggesting that Sammy drop his present PR man. That isn’t necessary. Isimply know that youhave made a sterling impression on Sammy; hence we need deal only with him.I know I resent it when someone takes it upon himself to advocate my choices ordecisions once I havefelt the spark. I doubt that Sammy - or any other public figure - feelsdifferently. Figureheads, celebrities, etal. are a goofy breed of megalomaniac and like to make their own decisions.Sammy made his, and I believehe meant it.You can only please a celebrity by pleasing his PR man so long. Ultimately asthe celebrity’s interestgrows, the PR man’s hostility emerges. You wind up with the equivalent of ajealous woman on your hands.You’ve alleviated Mr. Steinberg’s fears, so his boiler won’t have a chance tobuild up pressure. If Iknow PR men, he’ll never miss the Cloven Hoof if he doesn’t get it. But Sammywould.Mr. Bennett is A-1 and will encourage Sammy in whatever he might wish to do.Sammy will fill him inon anything he deems suitable for him to know.Please tear up the letters to Sammy’s employees and leave them off the Hoofmailing list; allow Sammyto feel exclusive.Write another letter to Sammy - a simple, yet sincere note expressing yourthanks and adding the phonenumbers (yours and ours) for his convenience. With folks like Sammy, we gostraight to the top, when wehave seen we can, and stay there. You should know how it works! You pulled itoff at Fort Knox. And, mydear Daemon, you’ve done it with me.Ad Officium Sæculum Satanas,Anton Szandor LaVey478Such candid advice hit its mark; I felt not a little embarrassed at havingassessed Sammy Davis’entourage so naïvely. At the same time I was fascinated by this unusual glimpseof Anton LaVey’sinnermost thinking processes. Furthermore I was deeply touched this ultimategesture of his confidence in- and paternal affection for - me. I replied to both him and Diane:Dr. LaVey has a way of making his “admonishing” letters so thoroughlyinteresting that I’m tempted tobotch things more frequently to get more of them. I found the observations onP.R. politics to be fascinating- and most assuredly substantiated. Among other things you seem to know a gooddeal more about DavidSteinberg than I do. Having witnessed you in action for a number of years, thisdoesn’t particularly surpriseme.I suppose that one of my faults is a tendency to be over-friendly. Thus I havegiven the DeHavens of myacquaintance the benefit of the doubt right up to the point where my hand getschomped upon. Even thoughSteinberg impressed me as being the nicest sort of fellow, he would be thelogical resort for non-Satanicinterests to turn to. And I’ve no doubt that his bread is buttered by othersbesides Sammy Davis personally.As to your favorable evaluation of Murphy Bennett, I second it 100%. He is an“old campaigner” whohas been with Sammy throughout much of his career, and the two of them willprobably discuss Satanismfreely and frequently. Murph can always write me should he feel so inclined.Consequently I have fed my original letters to Brandy and sent Sammy theenclosed one-pager, whichshould tie the ribbon appropriately. Your reference to Fort Knox, incidentally,gave me a smile. WhenGeneral Patton didn’t like one of the speeches I wrote for him, I’d get back anote saying “Bullshit - P.”. 479478 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 2, VIII/1973.479 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton & Diane LaVey, June 6, VIII/1973.- 265 -… At which point I turned my attention to other matters internal to the Churchof Satan. The subject ofSammy Davis, Jr. didn’t arise again in my correspondence until the LaVeys paidme a visit two monthslater in August. I recounted the news in a letter to Lilith Sinclair:Anton and Diane LaVey passed through Santa Barbara for a night last week enroute back to SanFrancisco from a Los Angeles business trip. They spent, among other things, amost memorable eveningwith Sammy Davis, Jr. at his mansion in Beverly Hills. His interest in Satanismand Black Magic is quiteserious, and I am more pleased than ever that he is associated with us. Itprobably won’t be long now beforethe word of his II° elevation filters out from his own sources, but we ourselvesshould continue to remainsilent on the development.480After Sammy Davis saw the LaVeys off from his Summit Drive home, he resumed histours on theshow circuit. By this time Dale Seago, who had left the Marine Corps, was livingin Texas. Aware frommy III° memorandum that Sammy was an honorary Warlock, Dale caught the localappearance of hisshow and wrote me shortly thereafter:The Sammy Davis show was thoroughly enjoyable, particularly for me, as I was inthe front row about5 feet from the stage. He generates a tremendous rapport with the audience byoccasionally involvingindividuals from it.I spoke with him briefly in his dressing room after the show, and I was moreimpressed even than I hadbeen by his performance. His voice was gentle, his manner most gracious andcharming, but he seemed tome to literally radiate force of will. It was as though his physical stature wasa deliberately created illusion.I could not help being strongly reminded of Magister Frazier’s statement in hisaddress at the FirstWestern Conclave: “Occasionally one of the Order will be placed into theexisting Church structure andseldom above the Second Degree.” Our conversation was mostly casual trivia,there being other peoplepresent, but I could almost swear there were other levels of meaning to some ofit (there was in my case),such as his remark that he will be meeting with the High Priest in October. 481The October meeting, unfortunately, did not go off as well as the August one.When I had presentedSammy with his II° medallion and Anton LaVey-inscribed Satanic Bible & Rituals,I had given him asecond set of books as well - inscribed by Anton to Sammy’s Poor Devil costar,Christopher Lee. WhenAnton and Diane arrived at Summit Drive this time, Sammy Davis had a surprisefor them: Lee himselfwas there.The LaVeys mentioned nothing of this - in fact nothing of the evening at all -to me afterwards, nor didI think to ask.But in February of 1974 I received a surprise phone call from Sammy Davis’secretary, saying thatSammy’s wife Altovise - currently in the hospital recovering from an operation -would very much like tomeet me. That next weekend I had to travel to Los Angeles for an Army Reservefunction, so on Saturdayevening I stopped in at Altovise’s room. Like her husband she was friendly,candid, and genuinelyinterested in the Church of Satan’s past, present, and future. Then she said,“It was certainly a shame aboutChristopher Lee!”Seeing my surprise, Altovise told me about Sammy’s effort to introduce AntonLaVey and ChristopherLee - and what had happened as a result: Lee and Anton hadn’t hit it off verywell - possibly because eachapproached the other with an assumed attitude of “Satanic superiority”. Sensingtrouble, Sammy Davishad cooled them both off, and the evening had ended politely if not entirelycomfortably.482480 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lilith Sinclair, August 13, VIII/1973.481 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, August 21, VIII/1973.482 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Altovise Davis, February 4, IX/1974.- 266 -“Well,” I said to Diane LaVey on the phone Monday morning, “so you werehob-nobbing with Draculahimself!” There was an awkward silence while Diane, I am sure, tried to figureout how I could possiblyhave known of the Lee encounter. After enjoying her discomfiture for a moment, Ichuckled and told herof my visit with Altovise. For once, however, Diane failed to respond with herusual sense of humor. Leehad been given an honorary Church of Satan membership, but it wasn’t a good ideato publicize it at all -and in fact he should not be put on the Cloven Hoof mailing list.I hung up the phone feeling a little confused. If the tension with Lee had notbeen ironed out, then whythe honorary membership? And, of course, Diane’s tone told me that I hadstumbled into somethingwhich, if not actually embarrassing to them, was at least something which theywere now embarrassed athaving concealed from me. I made an effort to brush it aside with a letter toAnton:Although I think I did a good job of not showing it to her, I was completelythrilled when Altovise toldme of your historic meeting with Christopher Lee. In my book that’s a realmeeting of giants! Please do notsuppose for a moment that I would discuss this with anyone.To set the record straight on one other point: I neither desire nor expect to beinformed of any matters -personal or official - which you or Diane consider private. I am certain that,if you think I need to be briefedon some development, you will do so. Thus, if as with Christopher Lee, I bumpinto something sheerly byaccident, it doesn’t bother me in the least that I wasn’t apprised of itbeforehand. It would be shallow of meindeed to worry about something like that after the wealth of friendship, trust,and guidance I have receivedfrom you. 483If I had sensed that I had crossed an “improper” boundary by hearing - evenaccidentally - of theLaVey/Lee clash, I was right. Anton’s response was decidedly frosty:Glad you were able to see Altovise and also show Lilith FJA’s Congress ofWonders.484 Please clearother “celebrity” contacts - either written or verbal - with me in the future,as you did in Sammy’s case. Youand Karla made an admirable and lasting impression.The reason for this, as you deserve to know, is that many of my personal friendsand acquaintances insouthern California are directly or indirectly involved in advancing theMovement. Should you engage incommunication with any of them as a representative of the Church of Satan, youcould inadvertently createan impression of organizational disorganization (not a contradiction in terms)where none might be assumedto exist. I don’t wish certain people to receive the impression that the lefthand knows not what the righthand is doing. You can only enhance your own apparent ignorance [unbefitting aMagister’s expectedknowledge of the Movement’s activities and contacts] by not checking out certainpeople and yourapproach to same with me.At this time many non-C/S open activities in Hollywood [and New York] hang intight balance, and I’drather not risk overlap. I’m sure you, with your PSYOP background, canunderstand. For the advancementof the Movement and the cohesion of the Order, I feel you should be apprised ofthis. 485Of course I had given neither Altovise Davis nor Forrest J Ackerman [about whommore in asubsequent chapter] any information one way or the other about the internaloperations of the Church. Theshoe was on the other foot; Anton was angry and uncomfortable over what Altovisehad inadvertently saidto me. He apparently wanted to be able to spin impressive stories about themythical & monolithic Churchof Satan without having to worry about the reality - even the presumablypolished M.A.A. reality -intruding.483 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, February 13, IX/1974.484 Lilith and I had spent an evening with science-fiction/horror personalityForrest J Ackerman at his Hollywood home.485 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, IX/1974.- 267 -Oh, O.K., I thought. Perhaps he’s justified in being a little hypersensitiveafter West, DeHaven, et al.Nor would it hurt the Church of Satan to “mind its own business”, i.e. that ofpersonal initiation into theBlack Arts, instead of getting Hollywood-itis.For that matter, I mused, I might do well to take more of my own advice. Themore I thought about it,the more it seemed to me that it had been ungallant to tell the LaVeys ofAltovise’s revelations. I shouldhave quietly kept the information to myself and thus not embarrassed them. Ifthere were one positiveoutcome, I concluded, it was that Christopher Lee was apparently abehind-the-scenes backer of theSatanic “movement”.Or so I thought until I read a copy of the National Enquirer in March of 1974:Horror film star Christopher Lee fears that the evil in this world has beenconjured up by black magicand devil worship. “I’m absolutely certain that there are thousands uponthousands of people today activelyusing black magic to get what they want. I’m sure they’re responsible for muchof the bad in the world,such as the wars in the Mideast, the killings in Northern Ireland, the oilcrisis, political corruption,communism, as well as the plunging stock market,” Lee told the Enquirer in hisLondon apartment.“Black magic is playing such a powerful role in our society that, frankly, Ifear for the future,” said Lee,who has starred in 14 horror movies, many of them as the vampire, Count Dracula.“Black magic has achurch-like hierarchy with leaders who want power over people. At the bottom arepeople who get connedinto devil worshipping because they’re lonely, insecure, or frustrated and thinkit’ll bring them a moresatisfactory life.”Lee said black magic is popular today because many people are alienated from acomplex society inwhich the churches no longer provide members much solace. Lee, whose living roomis crammed withbooks on the occult, has been intrigued by black magic for years. “My roles inhorror films brought me intocontact with people who furthered my occult knowledge. I feel very much thatit’s my responsibility topersuade people to turn away from black magic … and I think my movies do justthat by showing the truehorror of evil. In my movies the moral is that evil is horrible and goodtriumphs in the end. Remember:When you take the ‘o’ out of ‘good’ you get ‘God’, and when you add a ‘d’ to‘evil’ you get ‘devil’.”Some “movement” supporter! I wrote to Diane LaVey:I still don’t know what to think of that Lee article. The Enquirer will squeezeevery bit ofsensationalism that it can out of a story, but on the other hand those weredirect quotes.But you know him better than I do, so what - if anything - you want to do aboutit is up to you. I havealways been an #A-1 fan of his, so this is a sort of bolt from the blue. I canunderstand why he might takean occasional swipe at the Lugosi Dracula, since no one likes to be “secondbest” in a part. But this axe heswings in our direction makes no sense at all. 486About a week later I was called again by Sammy Davis’ secretary. Sammy wasreturning to the CircleStar for another engagement, and could Anton and Diane and I join him for anevening there? Afterchecking with them, I said yes, and the end of March found the three of us -plus an exotic lady by thename of “Helen” - in front-row seats for Sammy’s show.Sammy himself was evidently delighted to see us, greeting Anton with the Sign ofthe Horns duringone of his songs. After the show we four retired with him to the privacy of hispersonal suite at a nearbyhotel, whereupon Sammy presented Anton, Diane, and myself with the special18-karat gold braceletsgiven to his “personal family”. It was a truly touching moment - all the more sosince, as was the casewith Sammy’s own II°, it was meant on a level far beyond that of show-businesspublicity.Anton and Sammy settled down to talk about Satanism, which both of them agreedwas the wave ofthe future. Sammy had studied the Satanic Bible & Rituals in depth and wasbursting with ideas486 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, March 22, IX/1974.- 268 -concerning them, illustrating many of his concepts with stories from his ownpast as a trailblazer anddestroyer of social taboos in the entertainment field.For his part, Anton unfolded wondrous plans for the Church of Satan, includingthe possibility ofSammy’s eventually becoming the Church’s senior official for all of NorthAmerica! Retrospectively it isdifficult to say how Diane or Sammy or I might have reacted logically to suchvisions - but it was a nightfor magic, not logic.A note from Diane arrived a few days after my return to Santa Barbara:It was sure great that we could all get together with Sammy last week. Anton andI were most proud tohave such a decorous, elegant, and intelligent liege man as yourself toaccompany us on the event.487I had been thinking over my impressions of the Anton-Sammy conversations, andnow I decided to putthem in print. I answered Diane:Our expedition to San Carlos was really a delight, no two ways about it. If Ididn’t say much in SammyDavis’ suite, it was because it was such an intellectual feast to simply sitback and listen to Sammy and Dr.LaVey talk. It’s at times like that when I am acutely conscious of not havingbeen on the Earth very long.In my opinion we are rounding a corner when a lot of important paths are goingto cross. This is onereason why I am keeping such a tight rein on the II°/III° officials of theChurch … via my “force-feeding”memoranda and letters. Sooner or later these officials are going to be evident,and I want them to comeacross sharp and well-oiled when they do. Nevertheless I am very pleased withthe way they are all comingalong. Any time you feel discouraged with the organizational functioning of theC/S, go take a look at a fewother groups. We look pretty damn good. And we’re getting better all the time.Here’s an idea: I think we ought to make Sammy Davis a Priest. When we gave himthe Second Degree,we had no idea that he would take it as anything more than “just one more honor”among the thousands he’sreceived. Obviously this is not the case. He belongs in the Inner Circleofficially as well as clandestinely. Asa matter of fact, there is de facto justification for his being IV° or V°, whenyou get right down to it. Butwhy rush?Ordaining him would be a good way to get him and Altovise to 6114 (i.e. for theceremony). We couldreally do an #A-1 ritual - like the “good old days” - for him. Make Altovise anhonorary II° at the sametime. Ferro and I could bring up the rear, together with any of the people inSan Francisco whom youconsider cream-of-the-crop. 488No immediate answer was forthcoming, but Anton did have offer a hint of hiscurrent attitude towardsChristopher Lee, who, he said, “has gotten too big for his shroud to associatewith such goings-on [in thiscase an awards banquet of Hollywood’s Count Dracula Society], and pious in thebargain”. 489I thought I might have part of the answer to Lee’s National Enquirerstatements.490 To Anton I wrote:A bit of input from England which may or may not explain Christopher Lee: I havejust acquired afairly lavish volume from that country entitled Witchcraft by one Eric Maple. Itis the same old panorama ofpaganism, strongly biased towards Wicca. Maple is probably a follower of AlexSaunders, since that487 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 7, IX/1974.488 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, April 13, IX/1974.489 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 12, IX/1974.490 My guess about Lee’s Enquirer stance being purely for defensive publicrelations proved correct. Privately Lee has maintained a long-standing interest in the history and theory of the Black Arts, and laterdeveloped a friendship with Zeena and Nikolas Schreck, narrating the“Walk of Flames” exhibits in their Hellhouse of Hollywood museum andcollaborating with them on a CD entitled Christopher Lee singsDevils, Rogues, & Other Villains (Los Angeles: Wolfslair ISBN 19539-0527-2,1996).- 269 -character receives a tremendous amount of verbal and photographic coverage in atone of undisguisedadmiration.There is a chapter on Satanism, however, which is the sort of thing that mighthave registered with Lee.It cites incident after incident of graveyard desecration in England byself-proclaimed Satanists. Alsowidespread vandalism of conventional churches. There are photographs of corpseswhich have been dug upand mutilated. Not very pretty to look at. The text then turns to CharlesManson.With this kind of publicity accorded “Satanism” in Britain, Lee would be crazyif he endorsed it. Seemsto be much worse than anything we have here, nor does there exist a Church ofSatan there to present thereputable side of the picture. I sure wouldn’t mind seeing Charles Naylor andJim Moody roll up theirsleeves and do something about this. 491Charles Naylor was our so-far nonfunctioning Regional Agent in London, and JimMoody was an alsoapparently nonfunctioning Priest of Mendes III° in Northern Ireland. If I hadthought to prod the LaVeysinto building a fire under either official - or of giving me the green light todo so - I was doomed todisappointment.Lilith Sinclair was returning to Santa Barbara in the summer of 1974, and Ithought that she, as a truestar of the Church of Satan “in the trenches”, deserved to share in its moreglamorous side too. She, Ithought, should have the opportunity to meet Sammy Davis, Jr.; and surely theLaVeys would not object toSammy’s encountering their New York Superwitch. To Sammy I wrote:I am enclosing a recent clipping from a major New Jersey newspaper. The younglady in the picture isone of our chief “aboveground” officials in the New York area. She is very muchlike Diane LaVey in thatshe manages to be delightfully gracious and feminine while possessing a mindlike a steel trap. She will beout here visiting me during late July/early August, and I’d very much like tointroduce her to you if youanticipate being home to callers during that time period. She has been a fan ofyours for many years, but I’dalso like her to know you as Sammy Davis the Person. 492Wrong again! A few days later I heard from Anton:Apropos S.D., you put me on a bit of a limb with your “offer” to bring Lilithover. There is much youshould know re a Zaharoffian arrangement I have with certain persons of note.Please quash your plans tobring her by - or anyone else, for that matter. We must speak about this beforeAugust. Yes, Lilith is astunner, but she need be more than that. You could be hurt, knowing as I do howyou feel about her. Orworse, much of what I have nurtured could suffer. I shall accompany you toS.D.’s under the “proper” [orshould I say “improper”?] circumstances. He thinks the world of you and is aPrince among men. He is alsoa Devil with an admirably unique set of standards with which I must concur.’Nuff said for now. 493I had understood Anton’s admonitions to date, but this one truly stumped me.Diane took pity on mynaïveté and spelled it out for me over the phone; Anton feared that Sammy mightrun off with Lilith,causing any number of strange and hopeless complications. When I confided thisto Lilith the followingyear, she thought it was extremely funny - not because she didn’t like SammyDavis when she finally methim, but because abduction by a passionate Sammy had been the farthest thingfrom her mind. As forMagister M.A. Aquino, he had gone back to various forbidden tomes of magic loreto reconsider Sir BasilZaharoff - and “Helen”!Lilith finally did meet Sammy backstage during his 1976 tour at the Circle Star.After catching mybreath from Sammy’s welcoming bear-hug, I told him the story of the events ofmid-1975. He listened491 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, April 18, IX/1974.492 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Sammy Davis, Jr., June 18, IX/1974.493 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 24, IX/1974.- 270 -compassionately, then took my hand in a strong grip. “Hey, man,” he said, “itmakes no differencebetween us.”Since Sammy Davis had made it clear that he regarded both the LaVeys and myselfas “family”, I didnot feel that I could involve him in the tensions between us after 1975. Today Istill think that I did theright thing by him in this regard, and Sammy himself quietly terminated hisaffiliation with the Church ofSatan. In the newspaper-serialized version of his 1980 book Hollywood in aSuitcase, Sammy said:It was a result of the same kind of influence [Sinatra’s] that, for a time, Ibecame a Satanist.I was introduced to some very interesting people, including the head of theSatanist church in the States,and became fascinated by their philosophy. I actually joined the church to findout what I could about theirbeliefs.As it turned out, it was a short-lived interest, but I still have many friendsin the Church of Satan. InAmsterdam, for instance, the Satanists are very strong, and they never fail tosend a deputation to see me assoon as I get into town.I say this only to show that however bizarre the subject, I don’t pass judgmentuntil I have found outeverything I can about it. People who can put up an interesting case will oftenfind that I’m a willingconvert. 494The Church of Satan’s Regional Agent in Amsterdam was a gentleman named MaartenLamers (I°),who operated a devilishly-risqué nightclub called the “Church of Satan”,more-or-less-blessed by hismembership in the Church of Satan. After the 1975 crisis, he was made an“instant Priest” and hisnightclub touted as a “Grotto”. Subsequently it was closed down by the AmsterdamPolice, and in 1981Lamers moved to Las Vegas, whereupon the LaVeys ceased contact with himaltogether.The above extract from Hollywood in a Suitcase was edited out of the book as itfinally appeared onthe stands. It would appear that Anton’s assessment of the public relationsindustry ultimately provedaccurate.It is pleasant, I may add as an afterthought, to have Sammy Davis, Jr. comparemy influence to that ofFrank Sinatra!Sammy died from throat cancer on May 16, 1990. It didn’t take the vultures longto pounce. From theJuly 24, 1990 issue of the National Enquirer:Sammy was secretly involved at one time with a bizarre, evil cult that dressedin black, drank blood,and worshipped the devil.Sammy had such an incredible curiosity about everything in life that for half ayear around 1974 heeven experimented with Devil worship, his valet Wilson revealed.“He was involved with a cult from San Francisco whose members drank raw animalblood andworshipped the Devil. They visited Sammy’s home and dressed in black and alwaysdrew the shades tokeep the light out. I don’t know what they did at the house, because they allwent into a room with Sammyand then he closed the doors.“Their leader had one fingernail that was very long and painted red. So Sammygrew one of his nailslong and painted it red.“After six months he quit the cult. He told me: ‘Those people were evil. I’mglad I’m free of them.’” 495494 Davis, Sammy Jr., Hollywood in a Suitcase. New York: William Morrow & Co.,Inc., 1980, quoted in the Daily News, New York, September 11, 1980.495 No blood was involved in any Church of Satan rituals. The only visitors fromthe Church at Sammy’s home were Anton & Diane LaVeyand myself. Nor were any shades drawn. Nor did Anton have a long, red-paintedfingernail! Sammy remained an Honorary Warlock of theChurch until June 1975, after which he remained a personal friend of Lilith andmyself.[index-271_1.jpg]- 271 -Shortly after John DeHaven’s Stygian Grotto hosted the First Eastern Conclave ofthe Church of Satanin Dayton, Ohio on Halloween 1971, Warlocks/Regional Agents Steven Burgess ofOregon and WilliamMurray of Nevada began to discuss the possibility of holding a similar event outwest. Warlock/RegionalAgent Gerald Edwards of British Columbia and Priestess Margaret Wendall of SanJose entered thediscussion.In August 1972, after a surprise communiqué that Medford, Oregon had beenselected as a site,Burgess suddenly dropped out of touch with the others. Edwards placed a noticein the Cloven Hoofinviting indications of interest from western Satanists; the result was, asMurray put it, “a thunderingdisplay of apathy”.Edwards promptly cooled on the idea of hosting a Conclave in Canada: “I am notabout to throw ashindig for a bunch of ingrates!”On Halloween 1972, while the eastern membership converged on New York City forthe Third EasternConclave, Murray and Wendall drove to Santa Cruz, California to discuss theWestern Conclave idea withReverend James and Priestess Dolores Stowe of the Karnak Grotto. San Francisco,seemingly the mostlogical site, was ruled out by “Lana Green”, who told Wendall “not to have theConclave anywhere nearCentral Grotto”.496If it seems curious that the LaVeys would not want the first regional meeting ofthe Church in the Westheld near the site of its founding, one should recall the savagery to whichtheir home had been subjectedover the years. As Diane sadly summarized it in 1973 to Charles Steenbarger:The Central Grotto has been bombarded with bricks, bullets, one bomb, eggs, andspray paint. One ofour cars has had its windows smashed out 5 separate times over the past 4months, last night being the mostrecent incident. It has also sustained body damage from BBs and pipe bludgeons.497Undaunted, the Western Conclave planners continued their deliberations. Theylooked at Nevada.Reno, Carson City, and Virginia City were all considered, then dropped as beingtoo expensive, gambling-oriented, and “plastic”. In December 1972 a letter arrived at 6114:496 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, February 8, VIII/1973.497 Letter, Diane LaVey to Charles Steenbarger, March 6, VIII/1973.- 272 -To His Excellency, the High PriestDr. Anton Szandor LaVeyThe Church of SatanGreetings:May we, the undersigned, have the temerity to present for approval the followingannouncement toappear in the Cloven Hoof, the Proceedings of the Church of Satan, and to beotherwise announcedthroughout the length and breadth of the Infernal Empire?We who have taken it upon ourselves to consider and plan the First WesternRegional Conclave of theChurch of Satan do hereby make these presents: The First Western RegionalConclave of the Church ofSatan will be held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, 27-29 April VIII A.S. atCarpathia Chapel,Winnemucca Nevada.For those traveling by train, AMTRAK stops at Carlin, Nevada 180 miles to theeast and at Reno 167miles to the west. Air-charter and bus transportation to Winnemucca is availablefrom both locations.Winnemucca is located in north-central Nevada on U.S. interstate highway #80.There will be aWalpurgis ritual performed in Carpathia Chapel on the evening of April 30, VIII.All Conclave delegates areinvited to attend.The Formal Consecration and Dedication of Carpathia Chapel will be held on theEve of St. John, May4, VIII A.S.Respectfully submitted to His Excellency, the High Priest, the Council of Nine,the Order of theTrapezoid, Central Grotto, the Church of Satan:Gerald T. Edwards, WarlockMargaret Wendall, PriestessWilliam F. Murray, WarlockBy their most explicit order,William F. Murray, WarlockRegional Agent, Trans-Carpathia498This seemed more-or-less acceptable to me. Winnemucca was rather out of the way,but after all Ihadn’t stepped forward to propose a better location. The LaVeys too acquiesced -at least initially. In mid-February 1973, however, a surprising speculation arrived from Diane:Guess what Winnemucca’s main source of income is: prostitution! And guess why -I’ll bet - WilliamMurray lives in Winnemucca? If the mountain won’t come to Mohammed … Wonder ifthose involved withthe Conclave are aware of this. It is one of three or four counties in Nevada inwhich prostitution is legal.It isn’t the most prestigious place for the Church of Satan to hold its firstWestern Regional Conclave, Iwould say. But I guess that depends upon one’s point of view. 499A somewhat more formal version of this reservation was sent by “Kathryn Bower”of the CentralGrotto to Priestess Margaret Wendall:Regarding the First Western Conclave, Reno is a decidedly better image, inasmuchas Winnemucca’schief claim to fame is now its legal and flourishing prostitution, whichattracts the sexually starved from allover. We have personally dealt with the types who make pilgrimages to the nowhighly publicized countiesin Nevada where bordellos exist.Winnemucca has been amply covered in most recent men’s magazines. Those who arein the know[whom we really must consider first] who get wind of a Satanic Conclave inWinnemucca will surmise whatwe have spent six years trying to dispel: that Satanists are interested mainlyin sex!500498 Letter, William Murray to Anton LaVey, December 28, VII/1972.499 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, February 19, VIII/1973.500 Letter, Margaret Wendall to William Murray, February 26, VIII/1973.- 273 -At this point I decided that I had better get involved, if only to satisfymyself whether our RegionalAgent in Nevada were an uncontrolled sex-maniac or a country gentleman [orsomething in-between]. Itseemed appropriate to pose the question to him directly, so I did. His answerarrived in early March, andfrom it I learned more about the social climate of Nevada than I hadanticipated:With regard to your question on legalized prostitution in Nevada:Have I had any connection with this industry? None other than just being aresident of the State ofNevada.There are no “zones” or “belts” of this particular activity. In fact the “Nevadalaw” on this subject isunwritten. It is by local option only; towns either have it or do not. There areno legal houses near the greatcenters of gaming activity such as Clark, Washoe, Ormbsy, or Douglas Counties.Prostitution as a legal form of entertainment has been in Nevada for a longtime. The legal houses canbe found mostly in towns that are connected with the railroads. Some years ago ahouse near Carson Cityconsulted with me - I was a theatrical lighting consultant at the time - as towhat sort of lighting it shoulduse in its “mirror room”. And on occasion I stop at the bar at Winnemucca’s“Cozy Corner” for a drink. Theatmosphere is quite relaxing, and one is not hustled. 501Murray commented further to Charles Steenbarger, who had initially encouragedthe Winnemuccalocation as being at least a good central location between the Denver membershipand those on theCalifornia coast:To my way of thinking, it is indeed a shame that Winnemucca had to be withdrawnas the Conclave siteat this late date due to our dubious national reputation as a center forpromiscuity. The residents, myselfincluded, were never aware of the fact. I know it surely doesn’t seem to botherthe Chamber of Commerce.Winnemucca, Nevada is a picturesque little “western” town with a great deal ofcharm and historicsignificance. Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch held up the bank in 1900 -there’s a plaque there saying so!But I do see Central Grotto’s reluctance to sanction any official Churchfunction that might gain anynational news media coverage or comment. The perverted mind of the “press” iscapable of any sort ofdistortion to sell papers. If we had some of the press here for the Conclave, Iam sure it would be they whowould spend most of their time at the “houses” in question. 502Suddenly the Great Winnemucca Prostitution Scandal began to seem rather funny.The Great andTerrible Church of Satan worrying about its public image because of fivebordellos that the local residentsaccepted with laconic unconcern? Even Diane felt that she had better rephraseher speculation to me:Regarding the Winnemucca situation, I hope I didn’t lead you to believe thatMurray is, in any sense ofthe word, a pimp! I just meant that the availability of ladies of the eveningmight have made the little townof Winnemucca more attractive than it might otherwise have been.This opinion is based on firsthand observation of Murray and his rather franticapproach with women,which we witnessed when he visited Central a couple of years ago. But maybe he’scalmed down in theinterim. 503In his own account to me of his initial visit to 6114 California Street, BillMurray didn’t convey theidea that he had been unduly aggressive towards any of the ladies at the CentralGrotto. Rather it had beena perfectly pleasant meeting:501 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, March 1, VIII/1973.502 Letter, William Murray to Charles Steenbarger, March 10, VIII/1973.503 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 21, VIII/1973.- 274 -When I was granted the audience with Dr. LaVey a few days before All Hallows VI,I was received byHis Excellency, Lady Diane, and the then Central Grotto staff literally, itseemed to me, with open arms.Their kindness and apparent interest in me were overwhelming. It was as thoughthis were the “family” forwhich I had been searching for so many years.I can remember with such great clarity Lady Diane’s remark: “Oh, Mr. Murray, hownice it would be tohave you near us to help out.” - which was seconded by Dr. LaVey.I appreciated Dr. LaVey’s openness in discussing so many things with me, and hisallowing me to lookover certain Church mail that had come that day, his remark at the time being:“As long as you will have theresponsibility for some Church administration at your level, you had better seesome of the things we gethere.”At 3:30 AM I made my manners, said goodbye, and went out to my car a totallydifferent person thanthe one who had walked up the stairs of 6114 California Street at 9:45 PM thatevening.504From Denver Charles Steenbarger sent me his comments concerning Winnemucca inparticular and theproblems of Conclave public relations in general:I feel that much of the sensationalism and distortion by the news media stemsfrom their erroneousassociation to our label and is therefore apt to happen wherever the Conclave islocated. Even if it were heldin conservative old Denver, I can see the press forcing an association betweenthe Conclave location andour best X-rated show palace 50 blocks away.The crux of the matter, I feel, is a strategy of silence. If Winnemucca has sucha “sordid” reputation butis otherwise an ideal location, then I think that we ought to have kept ourmouths shut about having theConclave there. My guess is that the news media would generate unfavorableassociations between theevent and any Nevada location because of the state’s reputation aroundentertainment and legalizedgambling. But what Satanist wouldn’t prefer to lose his virtue rather than hismoney anyway? 505Bill Murray, nevertheless, had become discouraged concerning Winnemucca as aConclave site. Hecouldn’t help feeling that the Church’s concern for its image was a little latein coming, however:When I received word from Priestess Wendall about Central’s hesitation over thematter of the“houses”, I saw how the press could have had a field day with the information.Admitted that prior to His Excellency’s formal establishment of the Church onWalpurgis I A.S. and inthe following year there were some rather sensational items that receivedattention, i.e. “Anton LaVey andhis Topless Witches”, some rather graphic pictorial coverage in some of thescummier magazines, etc. Thisserved its purpose - and served well!At that point in time we needed “coverage”, and the press obliged. Oh, how theyobliged! Those daysare past and indeed forgotten.506If Nevada were out of the running, what about Santa Cruz - the beautiful seasideresort town inCalifornia that for the last year had hosted the Church of Satan’s only localGrotto in the state? It seemedlike the perfect location, but, as Margaret Wendall wrote to me, it had askeleton of a different sort in itscloset:I do have some reservations about holding a Conclave here in June or July. Themountains between SanJose and Santa Cruz have been the scene of about a dozen gruesome murders [seeAppendix #81 - M.A.],including the murder of a Catholic priest in Los Gatos last November. A suspecthas been caught and has504 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, May 11, VIII/1973.505 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to M.A. Aquino, March 24, VIII/1973.506 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, May 11, VIII/1973.- 275 -supposedly confessed to 9 or 10 murders, and I have a strong, instinctivefeeling that the trial will be heldduring the summer.Representatives of 2 newspapers have tried unsuccessfully, through interfacewith the Reverends Jamesand Dolores Stowe of Karnak Grotto, to link the murders with “Satanism”. 507Apparently either the press orpolice feel that “Satanism” is involved, and the Stowes have gone out of theirway to dispel any ideas thatwe are involved. 508It was finally agreed to hold the Conclave in Los Gatos - a halfway pointbetween San Jose and SantaCruz - and to disguise it with the public pseudonym of “Conference ofPhilosophical Writers”. When tomeet? Walpurgis was now past, and Halloween seemed too far off. July seemed tofit everyone’s calendarmost conveniently, and the way in which a precise date was arrived at is a minorstory of its own:Along with one of his earliest letters to me, Bill Murray sent some snapshots ofhis Nevada home. Inone photograph of his ritual chamber I noticed a magnificent suit of Japanesefeudal armor arranged so asto suggest its occupancy. In my next letter I complimented Murray on thisartistic treasure. He responded:I thank you for your interest in Mr. Watenabe, the Chapel Wraith. A distantrelative of his, Mr.Yamaguchi, stands guard in my study. Some day when I have some film I will sendyou his photograph. Asan interesting sidelight, “Watenabe” and “Yamaguchi” would be the Japaneseequivalents of “Smith” and“Jones”. Some day I hope to have the honor to visit you and meet your wraith,“Hugo”. 509This wasn’t the first I had heard of Murray’s interests in things oriental. Afew months previously DaleSeago had written:Bill Murray and I have been corresponding for some time, and I can safelypredict that you willthoroughly enjoy making his acquaintance. I found out recently that we’re alumniof the same MilitaryPolice school in Georgia.I received a cassette from him today - a recording of a destruction ritual - andit is fascinating. Hecombines Japanese music and thunder in the background, invokes O-yama andEmma-o. The result is athoroughly oriental-sounding Satanic rite. It sounded like something KarlHaushofer might haveperformed. 510As it grew in size, scope, and sophistication, the Church of Satan developedtranscultural ambitions. Inkeeping with the worldwide diversification of the contents of the Satanic Bibleand Satanic Rituals, I hadtried to keep the Cloven Hoof moving in ever-changing geographical surroundings.I was currentlyresearching an article on traditional Chinese “Satanism” for the May-JuneHoof511, and it seemed to methat Bill Murray might be in a good position to contribute a Japaneseco-feature. I extended the invitation:From the description of your 2 wraiths - and from Reverend Seago’s commentsconcerning the ritualyou sent him - it would seem that you are particularly interested in the variousbranches of orientaloccultism.I find this intriguing, having studied a good deal of Chinese, Japanese, andIndian history during mycollegiate years.507 See Appendices #82 and #83.508 Letter, Margaret Wendall to M.A. Aquino, April 2, VIII/1973.509 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, March 1, VIII/1973. Murray refers toa snarling Polynesian mask which I acquired en route homefrom Vietnam and named for one of Anton LaVey’s artistic pseudonyms.510 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, February 9, VIII/1973.511 Appendix #84.- 276 -Magister Frazier in Denver has also spent a considerable length of time inJapan. As a matter of fact, Ibelieve he and his family have only recently returned from another visit to thatcountry.Some time when you’re sitting around wondering what to do next, why not try yourhand at an articleon the Satanic aspects of Shinto, etc. I’m willing to bet that 95% of ourmembers are unfamiliar with thefact, for instance, that the Japanese celebrate a 3-day Festival of the Deadevery July. If it’s done in a well-researched fashion, I would include such an article in the next Cloven Hoof. 512Murray replied:Oriental occultism is not my strong point. I have never traveled in the orient,but some day hope to visitJapan.My connection with things Japanese comes from my theatrical background. At onetime I did a verydeep piece of research, during graduate school, on the rural aspects of thebunraku or “doll theatre”. Thereis a functioning bunraku-za in Osaka which is now underwritten by the Japanesegovernment as a CulturalNational Treasure. My study covered the aspects of rural, amateur performancesusing the doll-like figures.As a result of this I had many pleasant contacts with a Mr. Kubata of theJapanese Ministry of Culture,Dr. Earl Ernst of the Theatre Department of the University of Hawaii (he wrotethe book on Kubuki), andMr. Faubion Bowers, an expert on the theatre of the orient.As part and parcel to all this, I learned some Japanese acting styles, gotdeeply involved in jourinarration and chanting, and fell totally in love with the Japanese theatricalart forms, particularly bunraku -and, for that matter, all things Japanese: language, customs, dress, outlook,and history.Connected with this was my development of the “First American Bunraku Theatre”,which was aneffort of mine and my students when I was Professor of Drama at Sierra NevadaCollege. Our “Americanbunraku” enjoyed some vogue here in the west, and we made quite a few tourperformances with thistotally mad idea of mine. We designed and built a bunraku stage, constructed the1/3-life-size dolls, andadapted Uncle Tom’s Cabin for bunraku-style performance.We had several people doing the voices and narration rather than one jouri, andinstead of one samisenplayer we had several banjo artists playing Stephen Foster-type music in thebackground. The costumingand sets were pure “South”; just the performance style was traditional Japanesebunraku. I must say we hadfun.As far as doing an article for the Hoof on the Satanic aspects of Shinto, Iwould not know where to start.I do know that the Nicherin body does have a very “Satanic” outlook on manymatters. I’ll see what I cando. 513I didn’t get my hoped-for Japanese article, but I did learn something aboutbunraku! In any case whenMurray, the Stowes, and Margaret Wendall met on Walpurgis 1973 to set a date,they chose it to coincidewith that aforementioned 3-day festival of the dead, O-Bon.Margaret Wendall, I might add, was no stranger to oriental religions herself,having many friendshipsin the Japanese (Buddhist) community in San Jose. She remarked in a Walpurgisletter to me that the localO-Bon is the “only organized non-Christian festival in San Jose which is open tothe public”.Diane LaVey’s reaction to my Chinese Satanism article for the May-June Hoof waspleasantlypositive:Your “Yellow Peril” piece would make Fu Manchu smile! It’s really a good article- well-researchedand lucidly presented. [I’m a chart freak!]This “tolerant” new world in which we live has taken a lot of the spice out ofliterature and films thatused to thrill us with stories of foreign or alien evildoers with mysteriouspowers, and the inscrutableoriental figures were among the most colorful.512 Letter, M.A. Aquino to William Murray, March 8, VIII/1973.513 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, March 11, VIII/1973.- 277 -I wouldn’t be surprised if half the people under 30 who read journalisticdescriptions of Anton LaVey ashaving a Fu Manchu-style mustache or beard, or “a countenance that conjures upmemories of Ming theMerciless” (extraplanetary origin but nonetheless oriental implication), reallycan’t envision what the writerintends him to.At least the readers of the Hoof will have something to think about.514In the book review section of the Hoof I had originally included commentsconcerning a new book ofwitchcraft spells - The Crone’s Book of Words - and the latest offering by SybilLeek, at whom I had pokedfun in return for her finger-waving remarks concerning Anton LaVey. Dianedeleted both reviews,commenting:The Crone’s Book is published by Llewellyn, and after reading their latest issueof the Gnostica News[by “latest issue” I don’t mean that previous issues were much more kind toSatanists], we’re not inclined togive them any free plugs.The lead article, “A Lesson in Ritual Magic”, cribs an incredible amount fromthe Satanic Bible; andother bits and pieces with a Satanic tenor are sprinkled throughout the rest ofthe paper. This is to beexpected, and it wouldn’t be so galling if it weren’t for the followingreferences in a piece entitled “TheWhat and Why of Magick” [in reference to recruiting people for their “MagickalOrder”]:“We seek, meet, and communicate with these people [or try to] because every oncein awhile we willfind someone who isn’t crazy and who has that certain something which tells usthat he or she would makean adept. This winnowing process is slow, and in some cases [when working withsatanists and otherassorted nuts] dangerous physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This is thereason why we usuallyinterview people with a team.”And where have I heard these things before!:“‘Faith’ is not a requirement for a Magickal student. In fact ‘blind faith’would be a great hindrance.”And:“Generally persons who claim to have had many ‘mystical experiences’ on theirown, while not in sometraining program, do not make good High Magick adepts. In other words, kooks,acidheads, and the likeneed not apply.”It goes on to say that their magick is concerned with the problems and solutionsof the Real World andis not attempting to deny the world as it actually exists. I don’t know whateverhappened to these types’contention that “everyone has the power - it’s just dormant or undeveloped”,because now they’re saying ittakes time, study, and work:“It’s not easy … requires intelligence and a good education. A strong groundingin any one of thefollowing fields would be very helpful: ancient history, anthropology,archæology, English or Europeanliterature or religion, psychology, medicine, etc. etc.”In short, Mike, we aren’t in much of a mood to give them anything. We expect toinfluence and changethe way others think and look at things, but when we see our influence - eventhough we don’t expect duecredit to be given us - where [in the very same article] “satanists” areslandered, we don’t feel toocharitable!As for Sybil Leek, the most Satanic thing we can do is ignore her! Even thoughwe’re tempted to leavein the review just because of your most apt description of her as the duchess inThe Mouse That Roared, Ithink your analysis of the book sums up precisely why we needn’t refute whatshe’s said: “The mostaccurate thing we can say about it is that it’s typical Sybil all the waythrough.”Those who don’t already see through her braggadocio and pure stupidity neverwill, and those whodoubt her but still will buy one of her books probably buy enough other stuff onthe occult to run acrossconflicting reports with the account she gives of the Church of Satan. So whygive her a paragraph in ourpublication?514 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 31, VIII/1973.- 278 -It doesn’t matter if people think we’ve got a group in Houston, or that theythink Anton LaVey lives inHollywood. And the one thing that might matter - the “hippie type” statement -is refuted in enough otherplaces that one small mention in her book doesn’t amount to a hill of beans. 515Anton LaVey’s essay for the May-June Hoof was entitled “Million d’Arlequin,Vesti la Giubba, et al. ”.Referring to the well-known aphorism that “all the world’s a stage”, Antonpointed out that very fewpersons could qualify as bona-fide “actors” - that most are suited to being“spear-carriers” at the back ofthe stage, or even to being an attentive, appreciating audience. Attempting toleave the theatre isimpossible, since there is no escape from the world-stage’s presentations:Yes, the world is not simply a stage, but a theater; and it is a Barnum andBailey world, just as phony asit can be. Before it can become any more true, we’d all better damned wellrealize that. I like to think thatSatanists do, more than others. It helps me keep the faith.516Lilith Sinclair flew to San Francisco a week before the First Western Conclave -to pay her first officialvisit to the Central Grotto and to tour the city and its nearby sights with me.She was greeted at the airportby Karla LaVey and Tony Fazzini, the LaVeys’ chauffeur, and later brought to6114 California Street foran evening with Anton and Diane.Lilith was shown the marvels of the old house [pointing at the electronicconsoles under the elevatedbed in the Red Room, Diane remarked: “Here’s where Anton sits when he controlsthe world.”], and laterdescended with Anton to the Den of Iniquity, where, in the company of hisPhibesian androids, the HighPriest poured her a purple-colored liqueur. “What is it?” she askedmock-casually, taking pains to maintainthe image of the Occult Superstar of the East amidst the bizarre inhabitants ofthe Den. But her host onlygrinned, seated himself at the organ, and played for her one of his own ritualcompositions.Lilith survived the mysterious liqueur unscathed, and for the next hour listenedto Anton discuss hisconvictions concerning the actual existence of the Prince of Darkness and hisconversations andcommunions with him. He showed her the nearby Council Chamber, now cold andstark with itstrapezoidal altar, “Jacob’s ladder”, and looming Baphomet.When Tony finally drove Lilith back to her hotel, she felt that at long last shehad seen the real AntonLaVey - the essence behind the metaphorical mask. She also understood, as shehad only postulatedbefore, the true Mandate of the Church of Satan.A few days previously I had received a note from Anton:Dear Mike,Diane’s birthday is 10 July. Inasmuch as you and Lilith are going to Carmel the9th and returning thefollowing day, I would like to take Diane to dinner that evening. No greatbanquet - just you and Lilith andthe two of us. It would be exactly the kind of pleasant evening she and I wouldprefer.Best -ASzLaV517I had already learned about the date from Diane:My birthday is July 10th. And no cracks about my being a perfect Cancerian type.Confidentially I hatehome, family, and business dealings. 518515 Ibid.516 LaVey, Anton, “Million d’Arlequin, Vesti la Giubba, et al. ”, Cloven Hoof,May-June VIII/1973.517 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 28, VIII/1973.518 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 29, VIII/1973.- 279 -The pleasant evening was decidedly that, although it had its amusing momentstoo.First there was The Scratch On The Jaguar. The Buick Limited and the OldsmobileToronado neversaw the inside of the garage at 6114 California Street; that was reserved forAnton’s personal pride andjoy, an ice-blue Jaguar sedan. With due pomp and ceremony he extracted the Jagfor the trip to Saluto’s (aposh restaurant down the peninsula near the San Francisco airport). At 19thAvenue and Taraval, just a fewblocks away from the Lost Weekend nightclub, may still be found the smokingremains of the unfortunateShell station whose attendant nicked the paint of the Jag after filling itstank.Then, too, Highway I-280 is a nice, rolling freeway south of San Francisco. Itsuddenly occurred to methat my equilibrium was out of synchronization; I was carsick. I had witnessedthe Terror at the ShellStation. “If I throw up in this car,” I reflected in queasy panic, “I’ll be cutin pieces and fed to Typhon.”Somehow I kept my cool until we arrived at Saluto’s. We were seated at a goodtable - and from my seat Ihad an excellent view … out the window towards the gently s-w-a-ying surface ofthe San Francisco Bay!In the next issue of her Grotto’s Satan’s Spawn newsletter, Lilith reported onother events of her visit:During a recent visit to San Francisco, an official of the Order of theTrapezoid and I entered anestablishment called “The Museum of Witchcraft and Magic”. While the displayswere well-done - thoughSatanism was pointedly omitted - the employees were dressed in the expected,witch-type garb, which, froma magical standpoint, did much to lessen the impact of the whole picture.After viewing the exhibits, we identified ourselves as officials of the Churchof Satan, and their eyespopped. One could almost see the thoughts going through their heads: “Here arereal, honest-to-goodnessSatanists; but that’s funny - they don’t look like Satanists - they’re not evenwearing black!” Since we wereboth dressed quite conventionally, the impact produced was greater than if wehad been clad in “traditional”witchy-black-magic garb.While “dressing the part” does indeed have certain merits and can be great funas well, ofttimes acompletely ordinary appearance - the opposite from the expected - will leavemore of an impression andreally confuse those who like to think they have us all figured out … a smallexample of lesser magic inaction.The West-I Conclave in San Jose was one of the most enjoyable and informativegatherings I have hadthe pleasure of attending.One big bit of news is the establishment of an exchange of services availablefrom that particularGrotto, such as tapes of ritual music, book-tracing, printing, research, etc. Inthis manner members can availthemselves of such services as they may need.Secondly there are tentative plans for a simultaneous ritual to take placeacross the country in allGrottos wishing to participate.Congratulations are in order for Warlock Murray, Priestess Wendall, ReverendStowe, and PriestessStowe, along with all the other members of the Karnak Grotto, for theoutstanding success of West-I. 519Thus it was that the First Western Conclave was held on the weekend of 13-15July, 1973. Anton andDiane declined to travel south to attend it themselves, but Anton did think itan appropriate occasion for amajor policy statement on present and future directions in the Church.Since I was working principally with the eastern United States at the time, andencouraging CharlesSteenbarger to become the counterpart IV° coordinator for the west, I suggestedthat Anton provideSteenbarger with the information that he wished disseminated. The concept workedwell. Steenbargerreceived the letter reproduced here as Appendix #85, and he incorporated it intohis Conclave address -which I subsequently reprinted in the July-August 1973 Cloven Hoof for theinformation of the entireChurch membership. In that same issue I wrote the following report concerningthe Conclave itself:The First Western Conclave was just tremendous! There were visiting Satanistsfrom as far east asDenver and New York, as far north as Canada, and as far south as Los Angeles.The facilities and service at519 Sinclair, Lilith in Satan’s Spawn #II-2, June-July VIII/1973.- 280 -the Los Gatos Lodge couldn’t have been nicer, and all in all we consider it tohave been one of the mostinteresting and productive regional meetings yet conducted under the auspices ofthe Church.On this occasion there were three hosts: Priestess Margaret Wendall of theBubastis Chapel in San Jose,Reverend James Stowe of Santa Cruz’ Karnak Grotto, and Priestess Dolores Stowe,also of Karnak. TheUndead of Trans-Carpathia (Nevada to the profane) were well represented byWarlock William F. Murray,who served as a most spectacular Master of Ceremonies.At the formal banquet on the evening of July 14th, a major policy address wasgiven by MagisterAdrian-Claude Frazier, and later that same evening the members adjourned to theKarnak Grotto for theConclave Ritual. A Sunday morning brunch on the patio of the Los Gatos Lodgeconcluded the formalfestivities, after which the delegates left to visit local points of interest.Interspersed with the major eventswere both formal and informal discussion and debate concerning policies,programs, and future activities ofthe Church in the west.No decision was reached on when or where to hold the next such gathering, thedelegates preferring toleave the question open for the time being. Congratulations are certainly inorder to all who made thisConclave possible, and appreciation is also due to those members whoseenthusiasm and loyalty inspiredthem to travel such great distances to meet their fellow Satanists.At midnight on Friday, July 13, a select group of III° and IV° officials metwith the High Priest andHigh Priestess at the Central Grotto in San Francisco. As with the Conclave,this was not a strictly localaffair. Priestess Lilith Sinclair had flown in from New York for the occasion,but she lost the distance recordto Reverend James Moody from Belfast, Northern Ireland (which, we are told, isone of the leastconspicuous places on the planet for a Satanist to reside!).Among the matters discussed were many of the Church policies and programscontained in MagisterFrazier’s subsequent address to the Conclave and the long-term reasonstherefore. Certain information of aprivate nature and thus unsuited for the pages of the Hoof will be contained inthe next edition of theChronicles of Mendes, the private communiqué of the Black Order.We should like to tell you about one interesting development of the meeting. Itwas brought out thatmany members are impatient for guidance concerning magical researchopportunities. The High Priestinquired as to how many of them had exercised the initiative to look up thebiographies and workings of thefigures whose names are cited in the dedication to the Satanic Bible and SatanicRituals. There was a longmoment of painful silence! Need we say more?520The First Western Conclave marked a major turning-point for the Church of Satan- even more so thanwas immediately apparent from Anton LaVey’s comments521 as conveyed by CharlesSteenbarger in hisaddress.Most notable was an increasing psychological detachment of Anton himself fromthe Church itself,almost as though its actual state of being were something with which he hadfound himself uncomfortable.Coincidental with this came his decision to redefine the Order of the Trapezoidas something remoteand mysterious, presumably to preserve the impression among the Churchmembership that he personallytraveled in occult circles to which they did not have access. “There is stillmore to the Church of Satanthan that which you have seen and that which you and I have built together,” heseemed to be saying, “andthis is why I personally remain a being above and ultimately apart from you.”It would be wrong to assess this as simple narcissism on Anton’s part. In part,as this history hasshown, it was an attitude born of Anton’s disappointment in the actualperformance of the Church ofSatan: Since the real had failed to live up to his expectations, he would removehimself to the ideal, themagical, the “astral” Church of Satan, as it were.A second and more complex reason had to do with Anton’s personal character, andto understand thisit is necessary first to explore his attitudes towards existence andnonexistence, life and death. 1973marked many significant developments in this obscure aspect of Satanicphilosophy:520 Cloven Hoof #V-4, July-August VIII/1973.521 Appendix #85.- 281 -The January-February 1973 Cloven Hoof had contained two articles on thephenomenon of death:Anton LaVey’s essay “Erotic Crystallization Inertia (E.C.I.)” 522 and my own“The Secrets of Life andDeath”. 523 These, in addition to such thoughtful commentaries as that ofStephen Hollander in ChangesIV524 , prompted many Satanists to pursue their own investigations. Among thesewas Dale Seago, who ina June letter commented on a work he had found entitled The Secret of the GoldenFlower: A ChineseBook of Life:I can only describe the book as strange. It is a text on mental alchemy, and itsbasic premise is veryinteresting. It has to do with the development of the soul. Rather thanproceeding from the assumption thateveryone has a soul which survives death, however, it postulates that one can becreated, and givesguidelines for doing so. 525Dale went on to suggest possible correspondences to Aleister Crowley’s conceptof the “body of light”and the “Kirlian energy field”.I was interested enough to acquire and peruse the book. The Secret of the GoldenFlower ( T’ai I ChinHua Tsung Chih) is the principal philosophical text - in its oral-traditionorigins - of the religion of theGolden Elixir of Life ( Chin Tan Chiao) which developed during the T’ang Dynastyin the 8th Century CE.Its reputed founder is the Taoist philosopher Lu Yen, student of the MasterYin-hsi (for whom Lao Tzu issupposed to have written the famous Tao Te Ching).Richard Wilhelm (translator of the English volume) summarizes the GoldenFlower’s argument asfollows:Tao the undivided, Great One, gives rise to two opposite reality principles,Darkness and Light, yin andyang. These are at first thought of only as forces of nature apart from man.Later the sexual polarities, andothers as well, are derived from them. From yin comes K’un, the receptivefeminine principle; from yangcomes Ch’ien, the creative masculine principle. From yin comes ming (life); fromyang comes hsing(essence).Each individual contains a central monad which, at the moment of conception,splits into life andessence ( ming and hsing). These two are super-individual principles and so canbe related to eros and logos.In the personal bodily existence of the individual they are represented by twoother polarities, a p’o soul(or anima) and a hun soul (or animus). All during the life of the individualthese two are in conflict, eachstriving for mastery. At death they separate and go different ways. The animasinks to earth as kuei, a ghost-being. The animus rises and becomes shen, a revealing spirit or god. Shen may intime return to Tao.If the life-forces flow downward - that is, without let or hindrance into theouter world - the anima isvictorious over the animus; no “spirit body” or “Golden Flower” is developed,and at death the ego is lost.If the life-forces are conserved and made to “rise”, however, the animus isvictorious and the ego persistsafter death, attaining shen. 526To Dale Seago I wrote:I reviewed your Golden Flower book the other day, and I agree with yourimpressions of it.522 See Chapter #23.523 Appendix #75.524 Chapter #23.525 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, June 3, VIII/1973.526 Wilhelm, Richard (Trans.), The Secret of the Golden Flower. London:Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd., 1931, page #73. A more authoritativetranslation is now available by Thomas Cleary - San Francisco:HarperSanFrancisco, 1991 (ISBN 0-06-250193-3).- 282 -To properly appreciate Chinese religious attitudes, I think, one must understandthe raison d’être of theImperial culture. The status quo was viewed as the standard of perfection. Therewere no promises of futureprograms to alleviate existing social evils or injustices. Hope for a betterlife in this world was eliminated,in other words, and individuals were forced to turn to religion for comfort.Relief from oppression was sought through the submergence of one’s ownconsciousness in nature -nirvana, the Way of the Tao, etc. It is a voluntary abandonment of the ego infavor of what the GoldenFlower refers to as a “collective soul”. To say that nature is anomni-integrated process is certainly correct,but Satanism argues that it is not a conscious or deliberate process. This issimply our rejection of a “God”principle. 527Copies of these letters went from me to Anton LaVey, and during one of ourprivate conversations atthe time of the Western Conclave we agreed that there was a fundamental problemwith the notion that theegocentric consciousness could maintain a meaningful existence as such once ithad been absorbed into aUniversal one.Upon returning to Santa Barbara I sent Anton a copy of Maurice Maeterlinck’sLife After Death, inwhich that eminent philosopher examines the case for immortality. Maeterlinckraised the same objectionthat had troubled us:I care not if the loftiest, the freest, the fairest portions of my mind beeternally living and radiant in thesupreme gladness; they are no longer mine; I do not know them. Death has cut thenetwork of nerves ormemories that connected them with I know not what centers wherein lies the pointwhich I feel to be myvery self. They are thus set loose, floating in space and time; and their fateis as alien to me as that of themost distant stars.All that befalls has no existence for me unless I can recall it within thatmysterious being which is Iknow not where and precisely nowhere and which I turn like a mirror about thisworld whose phenomenatake shape only insofar as they are reflected in it. 528Maeterlinck ultimately arrived at a conclusion not unlike that of the GoldenFlower - that participationin a Universal consciousness was preferable to an ill-defined and comparativelyweak existence as a finite,egocentric consciousness:This ego, as we conceive it when we reflect upon the consequences of itsdestruction - this ego,therefore, is neither our mind nor our body, since we recognize that both arewaves that roll by and areincessantly renewed. Is it an immovable point, which could not be form orsubstance, for these are alwaysin evolution, nor yet life, which is the cause or effect of form and substance?In truth it is impossible for us either to apprehend or define it, or even tosay where it dwells. When wetry to go back to its last source, we find little more than a succession ofmemories, a mass of ideas,confused, for that matter, and unsettled, all connected with the same instinct,the instinct of living: a mass ofhabits of our sensibility and of conscious or unconscious reactions against thesurrounding phenomena.When all is said, the most steadfast point of that nebula is our memory, whichseems, on the other hand,to be a somewhat external, a somewhat accessory faculty and, in any case, one ofthe frailest faculties of ourbrain, one of those which disappear the most promptly at the least disturbanceof our health. As an Englishpoet has very truly said, “That which cries aloud for eternity is the very partof me that will perish.” 529To date Satanists had not confronted the problem of the non-corporeal egocentricconsciousness asbluntly as Maeterlinck had framed it. It was one of those issues that had, bytacit agreement, been set aside527 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, June 17, VIII/1973.528 Maeterlinck, Maurice, Our Eternity. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1914, pages#50-51.529 Ibid., pages #48-49.- 283 -for consideration when lesser, easier matters had been resolved. My Hoof essay,Anton’s interest incryonics and in E.C.I., and now the speculations of other initiates such asSeago and Hollander all pointedto a resurgence of interest in the topic - a signal that the Satanic Bible’stop-skimming treatment could notstand for much longer.No one was more aware of this than Anton LaVey himself, whose mind and ego faroutdistanced thephysical capabilities and health of the body in which they were incarnated. Aweek after the First WesternConclave he wrote to me:Your gift of Maeterlinck’s book was indicative of your very real insight of ourconversation. It is a raregem of wisdom, and I shall treasure it highly. It is only fitting that youshould bear that slim volume of lightfrom the Darkness most call death. Thank you.530This emerging dilemma concerning the egocentric consciousness had a direct [ifat the time obscure]bearing, it seems, on Anton’s mid-1973 decisions concerning the Order of theTrapezoid - as summarizedin his pre-Conclave letter to Charles Steenbarger. 531 The Order was nowpresented as being somethingmysterious, remote, and unreachable even through ordination to the SatanicPriesthood.It will be recalled that the Order had been introduced in the December 1970Cloven Hoof, wherein“John M. Kincaid” had stated: “The Order of the Trapezoid is the ‘Board ofDirectors’ and security staff ofthe Church … All Priests and Priestesses are automatically admitted into theOrder …” 532 Subsequently itwas the term applied to the entire Satanic Priesthood, i.e. III°-V°. [The term“Mendes” was appliedspecifically to the III°. It did not embrace an “Order” per se.]I scratched my head and wondered if there would be any objections or expressionsof incredulityfollowing Steenbarger’s speech. There were none - the membership either hadforgotten the earlierdefinitions or simply chose to ignore them in a significantly Orwellian act ofdoublethink. EvenSteenbarger himself seemed unperturbed.Like Brer Rabbit I watched from the briar patch and “sed nuthin”, but when Ireturned to SantaBarbara I decided that I’d best try to meet the problem head-on - particularlysince Anton had asked me torevise and update the old Manual of Grotto Administration in the new Articles ofProtocol. To Anton Iwrote:From your letter to Adrian-Claude Frazier and Diane’s memo to me,533 I see thatyou have decided todraw a distinction between the Hierarchy of the Church and the Order of theTrapezoid.The only problem here is that the first edition of the Manual for GrottoAdministration has stated quiteflatly that the two were one and the same, and periodic references to the Orderof the Trapezoid in theCloven Hoof have been worded accordingly.If we simply make an abrupt change, it will seem to every reasonably intelligentobserver that the Orderof the Trapezoid is a sort of “Humpty-Dumpty” concept that “means whatever wechoose it to mean”. Thisdevelopment cannot help but disappoint many of our III° officials who until nowhave assumed that theirordination signaled their entrance into the inner circle of Satanism.In spite of this I believe I understand the role you would like the Order of theTrapezoid to play -namely that of encompassing the overall Satanic movement throughout history,above and apart from anyone organization such as the Church of Satan. Thus such figures as Rasputincould be included within thescope of the Order of the Trapezoid while not, of course, being members of theChurch of Satan proper. Myrecommended solution is based upon the following line of reasoning:530 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, July 26, VIII/1973.531 Appendix #85.532 See Chapter #6.533 Both in Appendix #85.- 284 -In ancient Egypt, as was discussed in the Hoof article “The Source” 534 , therewere actually two Satanicreligious movements that were challenged and finally suppressed by the Osiriancult - the worship of thelife-principle that was represented by the ram-god Amon, and the worship of thePowers of Darknessrepresented by Set. My proposal is that we assimilate the legacy of each intothe philosophical realm ofpresent-day Satanism. The idea is not to “Egyptianize” the Church, but rather torecognize the origins of ourreligious system in human history.Order of Mendes: While its relocation from Tanis to Mendes seems to have avertedthe totalsuppression of the Priesthood of Set by the Osirians, I have found no evidencethat it was able to survive thedownfall of the native Khemite empire.From Greek and Roman accounts, however, I gather that the rites celebrated atMendes were soscandalous as to remain the talk of the Mediterranean for some time thereafter.I shouldn’t be at allsurprised to find that other devil-worshipping sects adapted much of theirmaterial from Mendes. If theauthority of this Order is cited as conferring the III°, IV°, & V° - and in factbeing the Hierarchy of theChurch of Satan proper - we will have a much stronger basis for our existingdegree system than we havehad under the old arrangement.Order of the Trapezoid: The Priesthood of Amon didn’t survive the imperialdecadence either,although it did succeed in passing most of its knowledge on to Mediterraneanintellectuals throughPythagoras and other non-Egyptian initiates.If the Priesthood of Set accounted for the sorcerers and psychologists of Egypt,then it seems apparentthat the Priesthood of Amon generally encompassed the scientists,mathematicians, philosophers, andarchitects. It was the priesthood which controlled the greatest dynasties of theempire, and thus it can becited as the impulse behind the most monumental achievements of Egyptiancraftsmanship.Lockyer’s Dawn of Astronomy and other, more recent works point out the marvelouscalculations andastronomical alignments that went into the great Temple of Amon at Karnak. Asfar as I can tell, themassive Pylon Gate archways built by this Order were the first trapezoidalstructures ever built by man[excepting, possibly, truncated pyramids]. And so once again I think we have anexcellent historicalmandate for the Order of the Trapezoid.The arcane and diabolical credo of the Order of Mendes should be more thansufficient to sustain theimage and impact of the Church of Satan as a specific organization. Thus theOrder of the Trapezoid canassume a sort of non-organizational, academic posture.The ultimate effect of these two complementary Orders within Satanism will be toillustrate once againthe guiding Principle of Duality that is at the very core of the Satanicphilosophy. Each Order will havecertain functions, but neither one will “dominate” or “control” the other.Rather they will serve to balanceeach other. 535A couple of weeks went by, during which time the LaVeys made a trip to LosAngeles to visit SammyDavis, Jr. and meet Christopher Lee536 , to pay a nostalgic visit to the “PinkPalace” of Jayne Mansfield, totour the Ennis-Brown “Mayan temple” house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (on thehill above GriffithPark - the house used in the movies The Black Cat and House on Haunted Hill),and to undertake a certainWorking discussed below. When they returned to San Francisco in mid-August,Diane wrote me:The new Articles look great! … Anton liked the way you handled the distinctionbetween the BlackOrder and the Order of the Trapezoid. You have a very nice way withcircumlocution when it suits yourpurposes!537534 Appendix #67.535 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, August 2, VIII/1973.536 See Chapter #24.537 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, August 17, VIII/1973.- 285 -And so the Order of the Trapezoid and the Order of Mendes received their newidentities in theArticles of Protocol. I drafted a somewhat more detailed discussion for theIII°+ newsletter Chronicles ofMendes, but now it appeared that Anton was a bit uncomfortable with such a“straightforward” approachto the concept of the trapezoid. Upon receiving the draft of the ChroniclesDiane wrote:Much of what you have said with regard to the Order of the Trapezoid and theBlack Order is quiterelevant and conveys what we would like to be known about it, but some needsdeleting and more needs tobe added. The additions Anton will relate to you when he sees you. For the timebeing it would be best toavoid the subject altogether in this issue of the Chronicles.As you know, it has been most difficult to speak with you privately for anylength of time during almostthe entire period you have been associated with the Church. The only exceptionwas during your last trip toSan Francisco, at which time Anton discussed with you the survival of the“spirit” following death.He has been wanting to discuss with you, in far greater depth than has beenpossible under existingcircumstances, the history and function of the Order of the Trapezoid. But thismust be done when you andhe are both “fresh”, which is why he didn’t get into it last time when yourprivate session that one nightbegan at about 2:00 AM. 538While my visits to 6114 California Street were infrequent, it is not true thatAnton and I never hadtime for extensive talks. We had many discussions during his trips toLouisville, Chicago, Santa Barbara,and Los Angeles; and during my 6114 visits we generally bounced ideas off oneanother’s head until wewere both groggy from fatigue!As for Diane’s reference to the “history” of the Order of the Trapezoid, bothshe and I knew that itdated simply and logically to 1966. But I understood what she meant, which wasnot the history of a“formal Order” but the magical principles and traditions which had moved Antonto give his Satanic Orderthat particular name. I returned to San Francisco over the Labor Day weekend,and a new piece of thepuzzle of Anton Szandor LaVey emerged during the course of our discussions:Among the dedications of the Satanic Bible are the names of “Max Reinhardt, abuilder of dreams”and “Hans Poelzig, who knew all the angles”. Both of these are figures from turnof the century Germany.Reinhardt was a theatrical producer and director in Berlin; he is best known forhis ingenious approach tolight, shade, and darkness. In The Haunted Screen Lotte Eisner observes:Max Reinhardt had mastered all the secrets of lighting. He had always been fondof clothing shapes inwarm light spilling from innumerable invisible sources, of rounding, melting,and hollowing his surfaceswith velvety shadows. Here his sole aim was to do away with the Verism andmeticulous Naturalism of theprevious generation. Before 1914 Reinhardt used innumerable kaleidoscopiceffects to appeal to hisaudience’s imagination. The stage would become a vast expanse bustling withlife. Bare wings and curtainswould frame the gentle curve of a Rundhorizont, a horizon whose concave surfacewas flooded, first withmoonlight, then with brilliant sunlight, then immediately plunged into darkness;stars flickered while a kindof magic lantern covered the sky with moving clouds. 539Germany’s artistic future, however, did not lie in the direction of the GoldenFlower of the animus -but rather on the dark path to the anima. Eisner continues:The German soul instinctively prefers twilight to daylight. In The Decline ofthe West Oswald Spenglerexalts the mist, the enigmatic chiaroscuro, the “Kolossal”, and infinitesolitude. The unlimited spacescherished by the “Faustian soul” of northern man are never clear and limpid butswathed in gloom; theGermanic Valhalla, symbol of a frightful solitude, is a grisaille ruled byunsociable heroes and hostile gods.538 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, August 27, VIII/1973.539 Eisner, Lotte H., The Haunted Screen. Berkeley: University of CaliforniaPress, 1965, page #48.- 286 -Spengler asserts that solitaries are the only men to know the “cosmicexperience”; they alone arecapable of experiencing the inexpressible isolation and nostalgia of the forest.540This anima in the German disposition was unleashed with a vengeance during thepost-World War IWeimar Republic. Cynicism, decadence, and heedless self-indulgence gripped thecountry; Weimar - andBerlin in particular - was “amazingly violent, unbridled, often exuberant, oftenfull of a strange andclumsy poetry, regularly very hungry and very sad, with touches of high lunacyand crankiness”.541A uniquely German term came increasingly into play: Schadenfreude. There is noprecise translationinto English, but it may be approximated as a sort of diabolical, gloating,malicious, fatalistic enjoymentof others’ misfortunes - particularly as represented in the cabaret and in themotion pictures of the newExpressionists.The prototype of the Expressionist film was The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919).The sets were highlydistorted representations of rooms, streets, and buildings. Eisner comments:Oblique, curving, or rectilinear lines converge across an undefined expansetowards the background: awall skirted by the silhouette of Cesare the somnambulist, the slim ridge of theroof he darts along bearing"},{"pageContent":"his prey, and the steep paths he scales in his flight.In Expressionismus und Film Rudolf Kurtz points out that these curves andslanting lines have ameaning which is decidedly metaphysical. For the psychic reaction caused in thespectator by oblique linesis entirely different from that caused in him by straight lines. Similarly,unexpected curves and sudden upsand downs provoke emotions quite different from those induced by harmonious andgentle gradients.But what matters is to create states of anxiety and terror. The diversity ofplanes has only secondaryimportance.542 [index_split_011.html#p286]To this technique would soon be added that of carefully controlled lighting. Oneof Max Reinhardt’scolleagues was an artist and architect by the name of Hans Poelzig, who haddesigned Reinhardt’s GrossesSchauspielhaus in Berlin (1919). States the Phaidon Encyclopedia of Art andArtists:It provided for an arena-shaped stage, surrounded on three sides by stepped rowsof seats, andsurmounted by a huge dome that, by a system of screens with stalactite-shapedelements, filtered aphantasmagoric light into the auditorium. This extraordinarily imaginative workmakes Poelzig one of themasters of early 20th century Expressionist architecture. 543[index_split_011.html#p286]In 1920 Poelzig synthesized the planes and angles of Caligari with Reinhardt’sand his own expertisein lighting in Der Golem, a film about a clay android brought to life by sorceryin the Prague ghetto.Eisner notes:Animate objects always seem to haunt German narcissism. When couched inExpressionistphraseology, the personification is amplified; the metaphor expands and embracespeople and objects insimilar terms.So we frequently find German-speaking authors attributing diabolical overtonesto, for example, thestreet: In Gustav Meyrink’s Golem, the houses in the Prague ghetto, which havesprouted like weeds, seemto have an insidious life of their own “when the autumn evening mists stagnatein the streets and veil theirimperceptible grimace”.540 Ibid., page #51.541 deJonge, Alex, The Weimar Chronicle. New York: Paddington Press Ltd., 1978,page #7.542 Eisner, op. cit. , page #21.543 Wildt, Lucia; Grafe, I.; & Blott, Rosemary, Phaidon Encyclopedia of Art andArtists. Oxford: Phaidon Press Ltd., 1978, page #517.- 287 -In some mysterious way these streets contrive to abjure their life and feelingsduring the daytime, andlend them instead to their inhabitants, those enigmatic creatures who wanderaimlessly around, feeblyanimated by an invisible magnetic current. But at night the houses reclaim theirlife with interest from theseunreal inhabitants; they stiffen, and their sly faces fill with malevolence. Thedoors become gaping mawsand shrieking gullets.“The dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created,” Kurtz declared,and this is theexplanation of the overpowering obsessiveness of the Caligari sets. 544Anton LaVey’s new vision of the Order of the Trapezoid - and indeed of theChurch of Satan in itsoriginal, pre-1970 mode - was not oriented to the animus of the ancient Egyptianpriesthoods. Rather itwas a creature of the anima, a manifestation of Schadenfreude.As the Church proper moved away from this early negativism towards a creativepositivism, Antondeveloped something of a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde personality. I think it is fair tosay that I myself became thecentral force in the Church moving it, after 1970, towards the animus extreme;while holdoverpersonalities from the 1966-69 period resisted this trend and yearned for areturn to the original anima,that negative, anarchic Schadenfreude that had seemed such a relief from theresponsibility to constructsomething better to replace the social injustices condemned in the SatanicBible.One of the “1966-69 personalities” was James Moody, who had received the SatanicPriesthood,exploited the Church for a “disinterested” academic article,545 served as myDeacon for the famous MissaSolemnis, and vanished into academic introversion in Ireland. As reported in myHoof article, he had beenpresent for the III° meeting at 6114 California Street but had not honored theWest-I Conclave with hispresence. Since he was pleasant enough at the III° meeting, no one took offenseat his absence from theConclave.As it turned out, however, Moody’s private reaction to the animus tendencies ofthe “new” Church ofSatan was decidedly antagonistic. He was relieved to see that the “Mr. Hyde”/anima side of Anton LaVeystill existed and was struggling to reassert itself. To Anton and Diane he laterwrote:I feel that you are taking directions that I myself have been taking. I willconfess to you that I have beendisturbed by some of the trends that I get intimations of in the Hoof. There aresuggestions that the Churchhas gone the way of all social groups and is now establishing an orthodoxy thatis designed to protect thepetty status of the “leaders” and the “old timers”. I don’t know what I amreally trying to say except that thefreedom, the glimpse of new horizons that the Church promised in its early daysseems to be disappearingbehind a cloud of pet pettifoggery, the few dictating to the many.I have felt always that the genius of Anton Szandor LaVey was that he saw theimportance ofintellectual freedom, of independence of all the accustomed “world views” thatlimit one’s thought. I wasafraid, when I returned, that he would have become so enamored of the status,the recognition, that thevision would have vanished. But I find that I doubted without reason. I shouldhave had more confidence inthe man I knew and respected so much, the man I had come to feel so muchaffection for.What you said, Anton, about the entrapment you felt led me to believe that youwill find a way to breakout. What you said about the directions of the “new” Satanism, the necessity toeventually react yet again tothe excesses of dogmatism with regard to structure and system, rather thanloyalty to a principle, left mefeeling renewed and confident that there are masters of wisdom still left in theworld.I don’t know why, but I came away with the feeling that there was something inthe wind: perhaps adramatic disappearance into a kind of ideological retreat, or even a physicaldisappearance as the chrysalissplits and reveals the new flyer. If that happens, I hope that you will let meknow where you are and what544 Eisner, op. cit. , page #23.545 See Chapter #3.- 288 -you are doing. I value your friendship, both of you, more highly than I thinkeven you realize. I am closed-mouthed and the loyalest of your disciples and will understand. 546If Jim Moody were so contemptuous of the efforts of the Church of Satan tofunction coherently andconstructively as an organization, I wondered, then why did he accept amembership, much less aPriesthood in it? He himself had never lifted a finger to help either Anton orthe Church once he hadexploited them to his academic benefit.In disgust I tossed his letter aside, missing its most important point: thatAnton himself had begun tofeel that the Church of Satan per se was beginning to escape both its initialSchadenfreude and thefawning dependence upon his personality that Moody’s groveling illustrates sowell.Anton was torn between animus and anima; he wanted to see the Church becomesomething strong,beautiful, and positive - yet within him there was also the rage of the nihilistwho feels confined andoppressed by even the most enlightened and individualistic philosophies ofcooperation. Hence his effortsto indulge both tendencies via the creation of an “animus” Church of Satan andan “anima” Order of theTrapezoid [or “Satanic Movement”].In 1973 both he and I assumed that a balance between these forces would bepossible. We did notforesee their ultimate, catastrophic incompatibility.Anton had not been content with vague artistic and metaphysical explanations ofthe Poelzigphenomena. He sought their scientific, technical bases - and what he found - andused - became theprinciple for his “Law of the Trapezoid”: that exposure to oblique or obtuseangles is dangerous ordestructive except to those who are aware of this quality of theirs [in whichcase their influence isstrengthening and favorable].Regular forms, like equilateral triangles and pyramids, are complete andpleasing. But any kind ofvisual “incompleteness” or “irregularity”, whether massive (the trapezoidalshape of the Golden GateBridge) or miniscule (a wall out-of-angle in a room) will tend to induce“emotional imbalance and ensuingacts of violence”. The most disturbing shape is a trapezoid, because it is a“frustrated” triangle or pyramid.In his essay on the “LT” reproduced in a 1976 Cloven Hoof, Anton concluded:If the Law of the Trapezoid is known, recognized when applicable, and eitherheeded or utilized, it willsave much hardship and tragedy, while still serving as a catalyst for change.Like fire, its powers aretwofold, depending upon how applied. Like the Sun, its powers are twofold,depending upon whether athing is growing, grown, or dying. And like the first crystalline fusion ofatoms, it will be the beginning andthe end, the alpha and omega of all matter. Avert your gaze from the pyramidsand look to the trapezoid, andyou shall be moved. 547The question, unaddressed by Anton, remains as to whether there is anything moreat work here thanmere æsthetic irritation with irregularity. We are, after all, surrounded by somuch irregularity in naturethat it is the status quo of our sensory surroundings. If it drives people toemotional extremes, then we areall more or less constantly and inescapably there. The challenge - as presumablyin Zen - would be toescape from this violent, chaotic influence.However there may be something at work here beyond Anton LaVey’s idea of merevisual irritation.Research by the Temple of Set suggests that the human consciousness is far moresusceptible than mostpeople realize to phenomena from the electromagnetic spectrum. Roger deLafforest’s Houses That Killcontained an early such speculation:546 Letter, James Moody to Anton & Diane LaVey, August VIII/1973.547 LaVey, Anton, “The Law of the Trapezoid” in Cloven Hoof #VIII-6,November-December XI/1976.- 289 -All the harmful rays I have mentioned so far can be detected and measured byscientific devicessensitive to microvibrations and electromagnetism. They correspond to gammarays, which are similar to X-rays. It has been established that the shorter their wavelength is, the moreharmful they are, and that they areextremely hard. It is precisely because of this hardness that they can so easilypenetrate all living tissues. Inhuman beings and animals they destroy red corpuscles; in plants they attack thesap.By drawing two perpendicular lines with a point in common, we obtain theshortest and most powerfulvibration in the Universe: the one I have already mentioned in connection withcolors - “negative green”.These vibrations produced by a right angle are shape waves, that is, wavesengendered by shapes astheir name implies. When they are emitted by symmetrical geometrical shapes,they are favorable to theequilibrium of living organisms, but they are unfavorable when they come fromshapes that are irregular,non-compensated, or deliberately combined or dissociated to project malignantenergy.We have here come to the impassable no-man’s land that separates science frommagic. If it is true, as Ibelieve, that this vibration is created by angular refraction, it is easy toimagine the superhuman powerwielded by someone capable of aiming, wherever and however he chooses, theformidable artillery of shapewaves contained in an ordinary geometry textbook. 548“We never did get a chance to tell you,” wrote Diane LaVey to me in August,“what happened duringthat very special ritual Anton performed in Hollywood.” 549 What happened, onthe night of August 4-5,was a work of necromancy.In Chapter #2 of this history is recounted Anton LaVey’s fascination with theactress Marilyn Monroe.There had been no hint of this within the Church of Satan until 1973, save forthe inclusion of her nameamong the secondary dedications of the Satanic Bible, but on the inside cover ofthe July-August Hoofthere unexpectedly appeared:In MemoriamMarilyn Monroewho succumbed on the 5th of August, 1962 CE at 1:22 AM on the Day of the Locust.Her sacrifice has served to speed the Malpocalypse and vanquish her betrayers.As an Angel of Earth, she is risen.Chi raffrena il mio furore…?It was not with the ethereal animus of Marilyn that Anton the sorcerer wished tocommune, but ratherwith the earth-bound anima.To understand how he intended to do this, one must refer to one of the Redbeardquotations selectedfor the “Book of Satan” in the Satanic Bible: “… Your immortal spirit shall live- in the brains and sinewsof those whose respect you have gained.” This passage was generally taken atface value, i.e. that theSatanist would “exist” in others’ memories.Anton now revealed himself to have drawn a different conclusion from Redbeard:that a sufficientlyenergized and conceptually precise envisioning of a person - augmented throughthe ritual forces ofGreater Magic - could actually cause the anima [at least] to “recombine” fromthe natural elements intowhich it had dissipated. This is true sorcery in the traditional sense, since itis specifically the earthbound,elemental manifestation that is sought.In the dead of night, as the anniversary moment of Marilyn Monroe’s deathapproached, Anton andDiane LaVey retraced her final journey in reverse - through the darkened streetsto the cul-de-sac of theactress’ modest home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood (a comparativelyquiet neighborhood onthe other side of the San Diego freeway from Hollywood and Beverly Hills).548 deLafforest, Roger, Houses That Kill. New York: Berkeley PublishingCorporation #425-02620-125, VII/1972.549 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, August 17, VIII/1973.- 290 -The recording of a heartbeat accompanied them - growing stronger as theyapproached the cul-de-sac;and as the black Buick Limited pulled up to 12305, a beautiful white cat emergedfrom the underbrush,stared at them for a moment, and retreated whence it came. Marilyn Monroe hadonce remarked, Antonnow told me, that if she were ever to return from the grave it would be as awhite cat. 550Anton had suspected that Marilyn’s “accidental suicide” was nothing of the sort- that she had beenexpertly murdered to silence her threatened revelations of scandalous sexualescapades involving John andRobert Kennedy [then President and Attorney General of the United States]. Antonwas not alone in thisbelief - it was common rumor in Hollywood - but conclusive proof had so fareluded all investigators.Anton was not interested in seeking social or judicial retribution [the Kennedybrothers, after all, werenow dead themselves] as much as in satisfying himself that the murder theory wascorrect. The appearanceof the white cat anima in response to the “heartbeat” Working, he felt, was anindication that he was onthe right track. A more powerful Working was now necessary, and for that heneeded the CeremonialMagical environment of 6114 California Street. He also wanted, it now developed,my own assistance.We left the Purple Room and descended to the heart of the building - the CouncilChamber. It wasextremely cold and stark, furnished with only two chairs alongside the spartan,trapezoidal altar, and as weseated ourselves I noticed the outline of a low mattress or couch at the far endof the room.Anton asked that we both direct our thoughts to the bedroom of the house in theBrentwood cul-de-sac, concentrating on the same residual, earthbound materia that he hadsuccessfully evoked four weeksearlier. It was in this bedroom that Marilyn’s corpse had been discovered. [HereI must explain that suchdirection of thoughts is not “simple imagination”, but rather what might best bedescribed as the focusingand transmission of one’s mental energy to a particular locus, so that somethingat or in that locus mayderive sufficient energy from it to make its presence manifest. Compare thefamiliar “poltergeist”phenomenon, which is the same principle applied subconsciously.]For perhaps fifteen minutes there was no change in the still atmosphere. Then Inoticed that thechamber, already cold, seemed even more chill. Gazing slowly about the room, Isaw that a change of amore material type had also taken place: The top of the low bed was nowdistorted with unevenindentations along its right side.I quietly drew Anton’s attention to this development. He rose, went over to thealtar, and energized thepowerful “Jacob’s ladder” electrostatic generator atop it. This was not done, asmany uninformedwitnesses to the Church of Satan’s “electrical” rituals have supposed, merelyfor visual effect. Rather itcreated a strong negative-ionization in the atmosphere, strengthening thecreative and concentrationalpowers of the celebrants’ psyches [see Chapter #22].Anton returned to his seat; the Working continued; and now - grotesquelyilluminated by the sporadiclightning bolts of the “Jacob’s ladder” - the full extent of the animaconcentration was realized. Within theimpressions on the bed there gradually appeared the nude body of a woman,face-down, contorted, andirregularly streaked or blotched with what seemed to be blood [it seemeddark/shiny reddish in color - asfar as could be determined in the faint candlelight and flashes from the“Jacob’s ladder”].The materialization of this body was accompanied by a mental sensation of“queasiness” - as thoughone had encountered something corrupt or unclean. This is not something thateither of us interpreted asapplying to the body per se; it is rather a signal of exclusively “elemental”matter combinations - pureanima, so to speak.Neither Anton nor I spoke; there was nothing to say; he had learned what he hadwanted to learn. Aftera few moments he extinguished the “Jacob’s ladder” and the candle, and both ofus broke concentration,sitting back in the chairs to rest. When Anton relit the candle a few minuteslater, there was no trace of the550 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 18, VIII/1973. See also letter, M.A.Aquino to Diane & Anton LaVey, September 6, VIII/1973.Lilith Sinclair IV° and I duplicated this Working, with certain appropriatemodifications, ten years later to the evening. The results arereserved to the records of the Temple of Set.- 291 -materialization. We returned in silence to the Purple Room and by mutualunderstanding have notdiscussed the Working since.Anton LaVey may have known the details of Marilyn Monroe’s death, but I myselfdid not. Thefollowing year, when Robert Slatzer’s book The Life and Curious Death of MarilynMonroe waspublished, I learned that the actress’ body had been discovered nude andface-down on her bed. Suspicionhad been aroused by how uncontorted the body was - not characteristic of deathby barbiturate poisoning -and of course there was no visible blood. It was the contorted and bloodiedstate of the anima that toldAnton what he wanted to know.In 1973 there were only the vaguest of rumors that Marilyn Monroe’s death wasanything other thanaccidental suicide. Despite strong suspicions as articulated by Slatzer, no hardevidence of anything moresinister had been discovered.In 1985 such evidence was finally uncovered and published in Goddess: The SecretLives of MarilynMonroe by Anthony Summers (New York: Macmillan). An expanded and updatedpaperback edition ofthis book was published the following year (New York: New American Library/OnyxPress#0-451-40014-3).Rare additional information not contained in the Summers book may be found inthe 1985 BBCdocumentary Marilyn: Say Goodbye to the President. This documentary is availableon VHS videocassettefrom Key Video. Because of its politically explosive subject matter, it is noteasily available and willprobably have to be special-ordered. The one time I saw it on PBS television inthe United States, severalof the more eye-opening segments had been cut from it. These are complete in theKey Video tape.Finally in 2011 the complete details were discovered, detailed, and documentedin Jay Margolis’Marilyn Monroe: A Case for Murder (Bloomington, Indiana: iUniverse Books).There had been another magical development during the summer of 1973: I wasrecognized by Antonto the second and full level of the IV° - Magister Templi - the first Satanistother than Anton himself toattain this initiation, as John Ferro and Charles Steenbarger had achieved onlythe preliminary level ofMagister Caverni.Anton LaVey performed my Magister Templi recognition on August 5 - theanniversary of the murderof Marilyn Monroe.[index-292_1.jpg]- 292 -[index-293_1.jpg]- 293 -When Anton LaVey became more and more successful, he founded subdivisions or“grottos” invarious cities around the country. Eventually, as is the unfortunate habit ofall religious groups, even thePagan, dissension arose in some of these groups and they split, one portionstaying under the ægis of HighPriest Anton, the other going their own way.Thus it was in the case of the grotto at Dayton, Ohio. A substantial portionsplit off, being at odds withthe rule from faraway San Francisco. They complained about highhandedness on thepart of Mr. LaVeyand decided to follow a more democratic line.The group in Dayton is composed primarily of young people between the ages of 18and 30. They aresimple people; their everyday ways are no different than those of any midwesternworking person. JohnDeHaven, a student and radio broadcaster, is their spiritual leader or “MagisterSacrorum”.The group changed its name when it left the LaVey fold and became the Church ofSatanicBrotherhood. At first headquartered in Centerville, Ohio, it is now located inDayton itself. Taking a leaffrom Anton LaVey, the Satanic Brotherhood also spread out into other cities,founding Templums orgroups in St. Petersburg, Louisville, Indianapolis, even in far-off New YorkCity.Hans HolzerThe Witchcraft Report, 1973551* * *CHURCH OF SATANIC BROTHERHOODArcadian Magistry, Athens, Ohio1, March, IIX a.S.[All sic] Dear Ms. Sinclair:Please excuse my lack of proper title, if there is another, but I have been“un-attached” with the LaVeybunch for over a year now and those who have been elevated to higher degreeswith the C. of S. have doneso without my knowledge.Enough of the excuses! on with the busniess….

Foryour further information, my title is Priestess of Mendes - one that I haveearned and of which I am justlyproud. Should you address me in the future, although I prefer that you do not,please refer to me as such.Your reference to His Excellency Dr. LaVey and comments about him wereunsolicited, uncalled for,and extremely distasteful to me. If, as you state, you are not “bad-mouthing”him, then what do you callthe sarcastic remarks? I call them sour grapes mixed with a liberal amount ofjealousy. The fact that youcould not measure up to the standards of the Church of Satan, nor sustainyourself within its ranks, doesnot give you leave to take out your frustrated ego on him. As for your commentabout being “lured” awayfrom the master, you are sadly mistaken. You may have a master, but we are ourown masters. And if yourmembership has exceeded the Church of Satan’s, why are you so busy trying todiscredit us and solicitmembers? Empty barrels make the loudest noise.Your offer of membership in your little “group” is not only unsolicited andunappreciated, but is aninsult to my intelligence. My allegiance is to His Excellency, the High Priestand to the Church of Satan. Ihave no time for disgruntled rejects, so please do not intrude upon me in thefuture. I hope I have mademy position clear, and I trust I will not be imposed upon by you again.Rege Satanas!Lilith SinclairPriestess of Mendes III°* * *Lilith’s response to John DeHaven was a beaut! And your letter to her expressedour feelings precisely.The letter he wrote to Margaret Wendall said that “anyone could see that thetext of the new book [theSatanic Rituals] was just a compilation of the III° test” - whatever that issupposed to mean, prove, ordisprove! All I can say is that he and Wayne West must really be hurting insideor they would have betterthings to do. West wrote Marcello Truzzi a “long, long letter”, the contents ofwhich we don’t know yet. Ithink it’s safe to say that Wayne West wants something that he thinks Marcellocan give him; otherwise hewouldn’t have broken his long silence with him. We told Marcello we thought so.He’s disillusioned withWest, but I don’t know to exactly what degree.By the way, Anton said, “I’d like to see them come up with a source for Mike’sLovecraft‘translations’!”Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino552552 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 21, VIII/1973.- 295 -Shame about DeHaven - that boy did have some potential. Actually it is not forme to comment.As an interesting sidelight to the matter, I was visiting Dr. LaVey when [theChurch of SatanicBrotherhood] was just starting to break. He had made a few cryptic remarks, andwhen the formalannouncement was made, I then knew what he was talking about. I had made someremark concerningwhen we would develop our “Martin Luther” or some sort of nonsense.He remarked that, if a “fundamentalist Satanic group” were needed, he supposedhe would have tostart one, at least sub rosa. We then talked about what a moneymaker that wouldbe. In fact theconversation between His Excellency, Rev. Bob Bently, and myself got quiteuproarious as we discussedthe many possible turns this development could take: tent meetings, shabbylittle busses touring thecountry, Satanic revivals, the “Billy Sunday” approach, healing sessions,sponsoring of Boy Scout troops.William F. Murray to M.A. Aquino553* * *Occult ObserverFresno, CaliforniaLast Quarter 1973MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE!- by Rev. Mike Warnke, president, Alpha Omega OutreachDuring my recent tours of the midwest and east coast cities, I found that theChurch of Satan - whichnow claims more than 100,000 adherents nationwide - has become the object of aschism. On the eastcoast many devil-worshippers now belong to the Church of Satanic Brotherhood.It is obvious that the new C.S.B. bears little if any resemblance to the circusantics of the Church ofSatan. This eastern “orthodox” group are serious practitioners of the Black Artsand rituals. In meetingwith the hierarchy of the C.S.B., it is easy to see that they are infinitelymore knowledgeable and betterequipped to practice demonic religion than their counterparts in the west.The C.S.B. is located in several major cities in the eastern part of thisnation. And we were privilegedto meet some of the ranking officials of the Brotherhood while in Athens, Ohio.We disagree with them -100 percent. We feel they have chosen a wrong cause for their faith. But theydid not harass us, and it waspossible to keep our relations on a human plane - to have dialogue with them. Itwas a refreshing changefrom the attacks we have received from the devil-worshipping westerners.These easterners showed a cool confidence in their form of worship. And this iswhere we see thisschismatic group to be far more dangerous than some of the more circusy types ofcults we have here inCalifornia. We hope this immediate and present danger in the midst of easternChristians will cause themto be stronger in their own beliefs.We can see the Satanists strengthening and updating their beliefs. And we feelthat this should be asignal to all Christians that it is time for us to stand up and be counted forJesus. As we are told in theScriptures, stronger is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.554***A lot less well-versed in the reality of psychic manifestations, and motivatedby a reverse fanaticismwhich obscures even further any reliance on facts, a former Satanist priest bythe name of Michael Warnkehas seen fit to establish what he calls the “world’s first anti-witchcrafttraveling mobile unit”.A sailor in his mid-twenties, Warnke used to be a Satanist high priest in theRiverside/San Bernadino,California area. But he saw the light, says he, and turned Christian, or ratherEvangelist. Apparently thecrusader had planned to become a seminarian during his teen-age years but laterbecame involved withdrugs. His next kick was a “witchcraft group” called the Centaurs in which hebecame a high priest.

When heoverdid the drug bit, thegroup threw him out …555John DeHaven explained how they all got together to form the Church of SatanicBrotherhood:“The Church of Satanic Brotherhood is a religious association of Satanistsfounded by members andformer members of the Church of Satan who were attracted by the idea of anational fellowship ofSatanists, but who felt that the Church of Satan did not serve this purpose. Ourchurch is governed by acouncil, whose authority is balanced by the ceremonial head of our church, thehigh priest, the executivehead of our church, the Magister Sacrorum, and the general council of allmembers.”Holzer: “You just showed me photographs of a wedding. Who was the officiatingpriest?”DeHaven: “The officiating priest was Reverend West from Detroit, and I wasco-celebrant in thatritual. Reverend West, who was with the Roman Church for a good number of years,and who left becauseof several reasons, wore his vestments from the Roman Church for the rite.”Holzer: “Is such a marriage legally binding by the state law?”DeHaven: “The State of Ohio recognizes our marriages.

Internal dissension incited a wave of “protestantism” thatresulted in the creation of theChurch of Satanic Brotherhood by excommunicated or disaffected parishioners ofLaVey’s Church ofSatan.Most students would acknowledge modern Satanism’s debt to Anton LaVey, aone-time wild animaltrainer who shaved his skull, grew a devilish goatee, and founded America’sfirst Satanic church in a blackVictorian manse in San Francisco seven years ago.What Hugh Hefner did for sex, LaVey did for Satanism - packaging and selling itas a voluptuousphilosophy and life-style and the social trend of the future.The diabolic messiah has published three books, including The Satanic Bible; hischurch circulates anewsletter, The Cloven Hoof; several grottos sprang up around the country; andchurch propaganda boastsmembership exceeding 10,000. Midwestern apostates, however, insist that LaVeynever had more than“several hundred” dues-paying disciples.Meanwhile there was ferment in the provinces - especially in Louisville. Thetrouble can be tracedback to Clifford Amos’ proclivity for white witchcraft. Amos, then recentlydischarged from the Navy, was555 Holzer, op. cit. , page #155.556 Ibid., pages #161-162.557 Letter, Ted W. Brown to William Ashton (Thomas S. Huddleston), November 27,1973.- 297 -teaching a witchcraft course in the local “Free University” when an Armyofficer, Captain MichaelAquino, asked him if he were interested in joining a Satanic church. Anoccultist since junior high school,Clifford responded enthusiastically, and the Nineveh Grotto was founded in 1970.One misconception about Satanism is that it perpetuates ancient, arcane rites.Not so. Its ceremoniesare mostly perverse creations of the members. In Nineveh, Clifford proved a verycreative ritualist. Thiswould have been fine with the church hierarchy, except for one thing: Cliff keptamalgamating witchcraftstuff with accepted Satanic methodology. The black marks piled up - and suddenlythe axe fell. A special-delivery letter from Fort Knox notified the deviationist that he wasexcommunicated for promoting whitewitchcraft and for other high crimes against the Church of Satan.This Draconian measure was later rescinded. In January 1972 Clifford receivedhis Warlock degreefrom LaVey’s Central Grotto and was made Nineveh Grotto Leader. But a few monthslater Aquino hadhim booted out again - this time for consorting with other Church of Satanoutcasts (including a formerCatholic priest in Detroit, who had called himself a Satanic “bishop” withoutchurch sanction) who hadformed the Church of Satanic Brotherhood …* * *September 29, 1973The National ObserverDow Jones & Co., Inc.To the Editor:Your September 1 article on Satanism states that the Church of Satan“excommunicated” a Louisvillemember simply because he chose to introduce an element of childishness intorituals. This is quiteincorrect. The individual’s active status was only suspended during ourinvestigation of a report that hehad engaged in animal sacrifice - a practice we do not permit. When it wasestablished that no such eventhad taken place, he was restored to active membership.The subsequent “booting out”, as you put it, of this same individual resultedfrom the discovery that hehad brought dishonor upon his office by participating in a ceremony with aformer Priest of ours who hadbeen dismissed for embezzlement.As for the “wave of protestantism” that resulted in the formation of theso-called Church of SatanicBrotherhood, we would consider the circumstances somewhat less noble than yourarticle represents themas being. The dissidents in question were thrown out of the Church of Satan uponour receipt of evidencethat they were involved in the merchandising of stolen property. We alsoreceived several reports to theeffect that they were encouraging female members to prostitute themselves forthe financial benefit of thegroup.While the Church of Satan encourages intellectual freedom and exploration, wetolerate only thehighest standards of dignity, ethics, and courtesy in our members.Michael A.

Daniels, EditorThe true source of this so-called evidence was in fact three disgruntled membersof the Stygian Grotto.One can rest assured that, if the local police had anything resembling realevidence of illegal activityby members of any Satanic group, they would take immediate action. Moreover itis rather far-fetched tosuppose that they would even discuss the matter with the national leader of thevery same organizationunder scrutiny. On the other hand, the three suspected slanderers had displayedgrowing hostility towardsthe Grotto leadership and were known to be in contact with the Central Grottoand Magister Aquino.The quality of the evidence gleaned from whatever source can be inferred fromthe great care takennot to repeat the accusation in the subsequent official account issued by theChurch of Satan. Being a law-abiding group, they are painfully aware of the meaning of libel.* * *There were two possible explanations for all of this. One was that John DeHavenwas, in secretviolation of Church policy, operating a hot-merchandise ring through the Grotto.The other possibility wasthat John, Ron Lanting, Harry Booth, and Gary Borton were the victims of aframe-up involvingpractically every other member of the Grotto besides themselves.The decision was reached that, at the very least, Stygian was untenable as aGrotto and should bedisbanded. Because of the extreme bitterness quite obviously evident againstDeHaven, Lanting, Booth,and Borton, it was decided that it would be better for them in the long run ifthey were to be completelydivorced from the Church. It was realized, of course, that the notice wouldcause them personal pain andprobably embitter them towards the Church, but to sponsor an accusation exchangewould just have madeeverything more hostile all the way around.M.A. Aquino to Clifford Amos558* * *I am not at all impressed with the recitation of so-called evidence which youoffer so belatedly.I am firmly convinced that, had the matter been given a fair and impartialhearing, John would havebeen vindicated. Instead of such a hearing, you subjected him to a procedureencompassing the mostintolerable features of the Papal Inquisition, to wit: relying on anonymousinformers, arriving at yourdecision in secret and before the accused was aware of the charges, and - mostdamning of all - totallyrefusing to hear a defense. The latter you apparently justify on the basis thathe only would have claimedhe was innocent - imagine that! Surely you must be aware of the horror withwhich I and most peopleview this sort of “justice”.Even under the Inquisitorial process, the defendant was at least given theopportunity to name anddiscredit anonymous witnesses by proving their malice. Had John been grantedthis pitiful defense alone,he could probably have named and disqualified his accusers. Indeed, I think thatI could have done so!Joseph Daniels to M.A. Aquino559558 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Clifford Amos, November 7, VIII/1973.559 Letter, Joseph Daniels to M.A. Aquino, January 30, IX/1974.- 299 -Be your age. We possess no authority to conduct private trials for suspectedfelonies. Had we pursuedour investigation to the point where we had legally-admissible evidence oflarceny or fencing of stolenmerchandise, we would have been obligated to take the initiative to turn oversuch evidence to the policefor prosecution.From the information and supporting documentation we did receive, we concludedthat there was areal possibility that the Stygian machinery was being used for illegal purposes.The choice boiled down toeither defusing the entire situation immediately or taking the chance that someor all of the Grottomembers would wind up in the clink.I was not prepared to take the latter chance simply to avoid hurting JohnDeHaven’s feelings in theevent I was wrong. I have since received no information to indicate that I madethe wrong decision.M.A. Aquino to Joseph Daniels560* * *Evening IndependentSt. Petersburg, FloridaDecember 17, 1974SAVED? - SATAN WORSHIPPER TURNS TO JESUS- by Paul Zach, Staff WriterWrapped in shadow and in the robes of a Roman Catholic priest, a man raised ajeweled sword abovehis head, turned to an altar draped in black, and chanted: “Hail Lucifer! HailSatan!” He was celebratingthe “Missa Satanicus”, a ritual in which the Devil is worshipped. Severalminutes later, however, the sameman bowed his head in prayer with skid row evangelist John 3:16 Cook andproclaimed his conversion toChristianity.The strange scenes unfolded Saturday night in an old, dark house near downtownSt. Petersburg.WFLA disc jockey John DeHaven, 28, who says he was a high priest of Satan untilthat night, surprisedseveral fellow devil worshippers by smashing chalices, twisting swords, andreading from the Bible afterdenouncing the Satanic ritual.DeHaven said that he had been practicing Satanism for ten years. Dog-earednewspaper clippings tellabout the dark ceremonies he has celebrated throughout Ohio and Kentucky. Hesaid he brought hisChurch of Satanic Brotherhood to the Bay area in April 1973, and that it hadabout 60 members until heand several others attending Saturday’s ceremony staged their dramaticconversion.“He was the number two man in the United States next to Anton LaVey,” John 3:16Cook said. LaVeyis the self-proclaimed California leader of the nation’s largest devil-orientedgroup, the Church of Satan.The fiery minister said DeHaven’s conversion Saturday night was the “secondgreat trophy of my life,next to my mother.” DeHaven said John 3:16 Cook “turned him on to Jesus” abouttwo months ago.About 20 persons gathered in darkness at the Satanic ritual. Cook, a Baptistminister from Tampa andmyself quietly moved into the back of the room as it began. What we witnessedmade those Saturdaynight horror movies look like kids’ cartoons. In a small adjoining room throughan arch, DeHaven stoodbefore an altar topped with weird artifacts. The only light came from severalcandles and the glow from ablack-light Baphomet (a five-pointed star with a goat’s head in the middle tosymbolize Satan) that hungabove the altar.“From the cloud that took the form of a demon in my view, I found life anew,”DeHaven said. “Hail, Olord of the universe! Hail, O lord of light supreme! Hail, Lucifer! Hail,Satan!” DeHaven chanted. A huge,goateed man who stood next to DeHaven at the altar repeated each phrase in aresounding voice. ThenDeHaven turned to face each of the four walls while clanging a bell and callingforth the four principaldemons worshipped by Satanists: Satan from the south, Lucifer from the east,Belial from the north, andLeviathan from the west.560 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Joseph Daniels, February 6, IX/1974.- 300 -“This is a fearsome place. It is the house of Lucifer, the gates of Hell,”DeHaven said. Eerie musicenhanced the creepy mood. DeHaven’s worshippers, some in black robes, sat witharms crossed andfingers set in the traditional horned manner. Cook nervously prayed to himselfin anticipation ofDeHaven’s planned demonstration of Christian conversion. DeHaven spoke in Latin:“Ad Dei Nostri,Satanas, Luciferi, Qui Lætificat Juventutem Meam.” And in a language calledEnochian, a “magicaldialect that resembles Sanskrit”: “Ol Sonvi Vaoresavi, Gohu Iad Balata.” Theentire ritual seemedauthentically evil.DeHaven’s transformation came shortly after a ceremony he called the “Ritual ofthe Accused”, inwhich a person rejects Christianity. He blindfolded the huge man who had beenattending him at the altarand said some downright blasphemous things as the man was symbolically scourgedwith a cat-o-nine-tails by another member of the group.Then DeHaven’s tone changed. “Our Father in Heaven, these stray children willrepent their sins.”Several persons in the crowd began moving nervously. One girl cloaked in blackran from the room andlocked herself in a back bedroom. She would not convert.DeHaven threw off his robes, twisted the jeweled sword he was holding, and likea person goneberserk slashed into the altar, breaking glass chalices. “For ten years I havestood before you, and what didI get for it? Not one damn thing. I think it stinks. I’m through and through andthrough,” he screamed.Cook switched on the lights and joined DeHaven at the altar. “I hope we see whatwe have witnessedhere tonight happens thousands of times again.” Except for the girl who hadleft, most of the audience wasriveted to their seats. Those remaining rose when Cook asked, removed theirsigns of Satanism, anddonned crucifixes. Then they bowed their heads and prayed - this time to JesusChrist.* * *Dear John [DeHaven]:I have often acted as your chief apologist and propagandist, but this latestaction of yours is too muchfor even me to gloss over. I cannot even think of a good way to blame this onthe Church of Satan!Joseph Daniels561* * *On a genuinely bizarre note, my telephoning around the country, talking topeople who had not mulledthe past over in some while, appears to have united the Church of Satan and theChurch of SatanicBrotherhood. Joe Daniels says - and LaVey confirms - that my calls led DeHavento call San Franciscolast month.I’m not sure I enjoy being the irreligious newspaper reporter from Fort Worth,Texas who caused anational reunion of Satanist groups.John Makeig to M.A. Aquino562561 Letter, Joseph Daniels to John DeHaven, quoted in The True Grimoire #III-3,December IX/1974.562 Letter, John Makeig to M.A. Aquino, October 21, 1976.[index-301_1.jpg]- 301 -Since my December 1972 visit to New York City, I had been publicizing WarlockRonald Barrett’s“Magician” occult store in the Cloven Hoof as vigorously as possible, knowingthat it was still strugglingto survive. The LaVeys seemed oddly resistant to this, and after a few issuesgave firm instructions that the“Magician” was to receive no further promotions at all. The mystery was clearedup by Diane LaVey in aletter to me early the following year:I’m sure Ron Barrett is a good representative for the Church and a nice fellow,but I am still convincedthat he’s a homosexual [clinically speaking, even if he’s “bisexual”, he’s stilla homophile]. And Karla, afterspending considerable time talking with him, thinks so too.If you sense a subtle hostility on our part towards him, please understand thatit is not him personally towhom we object, but rather to the homophile’s personality in general, which wefind extremely mercurial.We have been burned a number of times by homosexuals who are ready to “lay downtheir lives for theChurch” one day, then do everything in their power a week later to discredit theChurch if not recognizedfor something to which they feel they are entitled.I hope this doesn’t turn out to be the case with Ron Barrett, but we are nottaking any chances. We metRon’s partner, Bill Andrews, while he was in San Francisco with the ballet. Hewas definitely gay and wasliving with Ron at the time. This, coupled with the M.O. of the sort of bikeclub with which Ron wasactively involved [as secretary, I think], leaves little doubt in our minds.I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me to check his application before now, butI just went and got it. Inanswer to the “Additional Comments or Questions” section, he writes:“I am a homosexual, a sadist, and feel a definite empathy with Satan. Anexperience I had once has ledme to Satan. I was supposed to be a ‘white witch’, but color me black!”So it appears that would answer the question for us. The quickest way, we’vefound, to get ahomosexual member to turn against us is for Anton to show him any specialattention. Don’t ask me why. Ican only guess that, once he does, they interpret it as something it’s not. Whenthey find out that he’s notinterested in them sexually, it’s the old “Hell hath no fury like a womanscorned” syndrome. 563In the East Dale Seago had been writing letter after letter to Robert Ethel inan effort to coordinate theproposed East-IV Regional Conclave in Washington, D.C. Ethel responded withsilence, and it began toseem as though there would be no Conclave at all. Diane commented:Poor Dale Seago! He’s really getting exasperated with Robert Ethel, althoughhe’s trying hard not toshow it. I wish Ethel would just come out and tell Seago he doesn’t have time toassist him with the563 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 21, VIII/1973.- 302 -conclave now. He seems more concerned over losing the “glory” of being aconclave chairman than he doesabout the inconvenience he’s causing Seago and the rest of the members. 564East-IV finally did take place, as recounted in the Cloven Hoof:On the 27th and 28th of April VIII, representatives of the Church of Satan fromthe eastern areas of theUnited States met in Washington, D.C. for the Fourth Eastern Regional Conclave.Held at the Ramada Inn,the gathering incorporated both formal festivities in honor of the impendingWalpurgisnacht and informalfellowship, discussion, and sightseeing. A general meeting was held on Friday,followed by ceremonialactivities. On Saturday evening the Conclave banquet took place, and later thatnight the main Conclaveritual, the “Rite of the Undead”, was celebrated. 565The “Rite of the Undead” was a ritual incorporating a theme of vampirism.Composed by Dale Seago,it has proved to be one of the more durable and popular rituals, surviving wellinto the 1980s.It has been modified several times, both by Seago and by other performers, andelaborate accessorieshave been constructed and utilized for it. The text that appears as Appendix #86is the original version sentto me by Seago in early 1973, and which I published in the May-June Cloven Hoof.The LaVeys hadmixed feelings about it, as Diane recounted to me:I’m going to blot out the “(to Beauclerk)” after the heading on Dale Seago’sritual. I don’t knowwhether you realized it or not, but “Beauclerk” is Murray. Aside from theobvious reason that Bill Murrayassumes enough credit for himself without giving him something more to crowabout [at least at this stageof the game], I think Dale’s main reason for dedicating the rite to him was thename of Murray’s chapel plushis innocent admiration for an “older and wiser” practitioner.Actually, if credit were to be given to the proper sources for the ritual, itshould go to (a) the SatanicRituals [No, it’s not sour grapes on our part, for we genuinely admire thecreative manner in which Dale hasparaphrased “Homage to Tchort” and come up with a new ritual to suit a differentpurpose.], and (b)Michael McQuown [Imagine us thinking Mr. Ego himself should get credit!] fordoping out the Russian forhim which wasn’t in “Homage to Tchort” but is in the “Rite of the Undead”. 566Behind my bland Cloven Hoof account of East-IV, however, lay a rather morecontroversial story. Itcommenced with a letter from Dale Seago to “Lana Green” immediately followingthe Conclave:Reverend Ethel still had not finished preparing his ritual when he arrived onthe 28th. What he proposedinstead was a reading of passages verbatim from Lovecraft’s Necronomicon. I toldhim an invocation of theOld Ones would be fine for openers, but what then? He asked if I could ad-libsomething from that point.Since Ms. Linda Thomas of the Lilith Grotto had already volunteered to serve asa living altar (clothed,of course), I suggested that we use her as a medium of manifestation for theforces invoked. Ms. Thomaswas agreeable, so I hypnotized her before the ritual and instructed her to keepher mind especially receptiveduring the ceremony.The ritual began in the prescribed manner as per the Satanic Bible. After thereading of the ThirdEnochian Key by Priestess Sinclair, Reverend Ethel began reading portions of theNecronomicon andinvoking the Old Ones. At this point he began shouting and capering about,reminding me of nothing somuch as a primitive shaman or witch doctor. The members of Reverend Ethel’sgroup, following hisexample, began moaning and thrashing around, crying out such things as: “The OldOnes are here!” “I feelthe power!” “Satan is with us!” It began to look like a bunch of Christian “holyrollers” at a revivalmeeting.564 Ibid.565 Cloven Hoof #V-3, May-June VIII/1973, page #10.566 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 31, VIII/1973.- 303 -Priestess Sinclair and I were shocked. Ms. Thomas sat up on the altar, stillunder hypnosis, anddelivered a warning to the effect that power had been summoned which only a fewcould use, and that therewere charlatans among us - the latter being a self-evident fact.Priestess Sinclair and I reached a decision and called for silence. With hersupport I then pronounced acurse on the pretenders who were only physically with us. Priestess Sinclairthen closed the Gate, and theritual was concluded.Both Priestess Sinclair and I were shocked and disgusted with the way things hadgone, as were most ofthe Lilith Grotto members and some of the other delegates. The fact that most ofReverend Ethel’s groupseemed pleased and impressed by the ritual made the situation worse, as itindicates some gravemisconceptions about ritual magic.Seago summarized his impressions of Ethel’s Washington, D.C. activities ingeneral:The members of Reverend Ethel’s Washington group are dissatisfied with ReverendEthel’s officious,high-handed manner and have taken proper measures to try to correct thesituation, without success. Theyare not receiving a proper perspective on Satanism from Reverend Ethel, which isa shame.I was very favorably impressed with the quality of the local membership, withthe exceptions of MegLongoria and Roland Holt (who struck me as a sycophant). The members there stillrespect ReverendEthel’s title and position, but they are rapidly losing their respect for theman himself.Priestess Sinclair and I are both very much concerned that Reverend Ethel couldbe another WayneWest in the making. 567From New York Lilith Sinclair commented to me:I received a copy of Reverend Seago’s report on the Conclave, and I am sorry tosay I agree with hisreport completely. I never saw such a spectacle. It’s a shame, as there are somepotentially good peoplethere. Hopefully something can be done to salvage the situation. 568It fell to me to pass these observations along to Robert Ethel for his response,which came in June:I had no intention of dumping the Saturday night program in Reverend Seago’slap, and did not. I askedthem [sic] if they wished to participate in the running of the ritual out ofcourtesy. I see how it was taken.My behavior during the ritual was not undignified. Following the ritual I wasintending to register acomplaint concerning Priestess Sinclair but thought better of it. 569Not having been at the Conclave personally, I was unable to judge theallegations conclusively. Itseemed to me that it had most probably been a case of clashing frames ofreference, something notuncommon in any artistic encounter. The best thing to do, I supposed, was to tryto spread oil on thewaters and hopefully restore eastern inter-Grotto relations to their previousharmony. To Ethel I said:The defining of “right” and “wrong” is particularly tricky for a Satanist due tothe strongly subjectivenature of his philosophy. The more accomplished a Black Magician becomes, theless he or she is likely toagree 100% with another practitioner on, say, ritual methodology or lessermagical techniques. Ours is anindividualistic art. Frankly I don’t know two Priests or Priestesses in theentire Church who agree with each567 Letter, L. Dale Seago to “Lana Green”, May 1, VIII/1973.568 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, May 15, VIII/1973.569 Letter, Robert Ethel to M.A. Aquino, June 5, VIII/1973.- 304 -other on everything. I expect I should have been more surprised had the Conclavecome off without anycontroversy at all. 570… While to Dale Seago I commented:While I have never met Ethel or observed his ritual techniques, I do know thatyou, Lilith, and Shaifavor a rather reflective approach to ceremonial magic. This is my ownpreference as well, since I havealways been a champion of understatement. But we must recognize that there isroom for flamboyance andeven crudeness as well.Every magician must act in accordance with his will. If Ethel had been creatingan atmosphere ofsubjugation in his circle after the fashion of Wayne West, it would be adifferent story altogether. But thisdoesn’t appear to be the case. So, unless the Council should rule otherwise, Iam satisfied that Ethel isobserving the standards expected of his degree.571In his pre-West-I letters to me, Bill Murray recalled his almost nostalgicemotion upon beingwelcomed to 6114 California Street for an evening with the LaVeys. He had sincebeen kept at arm’slength by them, and had interpreted this as a general remoteness on Anton’spart. To Bill I observed in aJune letter:Looking at it in one way, I suppose, you are right: Dr. LaVey is now moredistant from the Churchmembership than he has been previously. There is a very substantive reason forthis, however. Such is hischarisma that Satanists have tended to idolize him, his style of living, and hiswork to the abandonment oftheir own individuality. This is contrary to the principles of true Satanism,which commend everypractitioner to seek out and perfect his or her own sphere of magical influence.To my way of thinking, Aleister Crowley made one of his cardinal errors in thisregard. Accepting anumber of admiring disciples in close proximity, he proceeded to transform theiregos into pale reflectionsof his own, sucked them dry of their creativity, and finally cast them asidelike so many rag dolls. Thus hesucceeded in amusing himself, but how many magicians were the better for havingaccepted his tutelage?Were you to pattern yourself after Anton Szandor LaVey, you would fail miserablyas a Satanist. Thesame holds true in my case, as well as in the cases of the many accomplishedsorcerers the Church hasincluded to date. What Dr. LaVey has done has been to give others the magicaltools to become adept atBlack Magic. By virtue of your degree you have proven your ability to use them,and in the course of timethe nostalgia you feel toward the Central Grotto will disappear in favor of amore self-sufficient attitude.And at that point you will recognize very little “distance” between yourself andthe High Priest. 572As was so often the case with dialogue within the Church of Satan, Murray’sresponse had encouragedhis reflection on another topic as well - that of a new sense of individualityhe had been developing:I particularly admired your comments regarding the matter of Dr. LaVey’snow-apparent “distance” andthe reasons for this development. For some months I have had an undercurrentfeeling that this might be thecase. I do not mean to sound “fey” in making this statement. So many people, injoining any organization,do so for reasons of image-identification with its founders or leadingpersonalities.I once remarked in a discussion that the Church of Satan had almost a “built-inself-destructmechanism”, in that it did stress the development of individuality. Once all mengrasped the concept ofSatanism, there would be no further need for an organized body. Of course, theidea of a church no longerhaving to exist once its function is completed is unthinkable to one ofJudæo-Christian background: a sadcomment on Western man.570 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Robert Ethel, June 12, VIII/1973.571 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, June 17, VIII/1973.572 Letter, M.A. Aquino to William Murray, June 2, VIII/1973.- 305 -I went on to say that by this “individuality” we in no way imply “going out anddoing your thing” withall the modern implications of this worn-out phrase. That would be anarchy in avery pure and simple form.Our discipline lies in your phrasing of the matter of “principles of trueSatanism”.Perhaps you can explain another feeling I have had for a very long time. It isvery difficult for me todescribe it intelligently. It is that there is a “mind within my mind” whichdevelops a concept or idea, yetone which is inexpressible in spoken or written word by the outer mind. Doesthis make any sense? 573I answered:Your sensation that you possess a “mind within your mind” does make sense,though I would beinclined to describe it in a somewhat different manner. Satanism is a twofoldprocess: first an intellectualpurge of nonsensical superstitions (both social and mythical) and then arealization of the channels ofinfluence through which both animate and insensate matter can be controlled. Inthis context Satanism is the“science of control”.Most persons enter the Church expecting to have us swaddle them more securely inthe securityblankets of occultism - the Cabala, Tao, Vedas, or whatever. The nihilism of theSatanic Bible can be a realshock to such individuals. The point here is that the true Satanist uses suchpopular superstition and socialnorms to his advantage; he is not used by them. Prior to joining the Church,your mind clung to anotherform of external protectorate. As with most newcomers to the Left-Hand Path,your conditioned devotionfound a new focus - the Central Grotto. This is completely natural.This is where the Church of Satan differs sharply from other religious groups.Any other organizationwould not only permit you to continue this focus - it would encourage it. Youwould become an intellectualslave of the sect, and an appropriate way would be found to drain yourpocketbook as well.But now you are “on your own” in a much more all-inclusive sense than you haveever been before.There is no external God on whom you can fall back; thus you have begun tore-create yourself as a god.Hence the awareness of a “new mind” within you - in essence your demonic self.You will find that you are able to “step outside” of humanity and view it almostas a motion picturewhich is unfolding before your eyes. Through your magical abilities you willincreasingly be able to“adjust” it here and there to your liking. You will become less dependent uponthe opinions of others asmeasures of your success, and correspondingly your own powers of self-evaluationwill become sharperand more exacting.None of this can be taught to you in the formal sense of the term - at least notby other humans. If youare in fact being instructed, it is by the Powers of Darkness to whom you havegiven your confidence. Youwill perhaps decide that Satan and the other High Dæmons are not quite sofigurative as we would like ourprofane critics to believe. 574I had also been correspondingwith Warlock Stephen Hollander, one of the CanadianRegional Agents.He had undertaken to do some preliminary planning for a First InternationalConclave of the Church,tentatively scheduled for Halloween in the Year Nine (1974). He also aspired tothe Satanic Priesthood,and in early 1973 he asked me the surprising question of whether the MissionSanta Barbara happened tobe the only one of the California Missions with two bell towers. I answered:Your many articles and essays speak for themselves, and Reverend Grumboski hasrecommended youvery highly as well. Each candidate for the Priesthood is also asked to sponsora minimum of ten newmembers of the Church. There are two primary reasons for this.First, it serves to separate the Black Magician from the armchair intellectual.Satanic Priests andPriestesses must be active in their own right; they cannot merely be competentcritics of others. Second, thesort of persons you sponsor will indicate much concerning the social circles inwhich you move and the573 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, June 7, VIII/1973.574 Letter, M.A. Aquino to William Murray, July 1, VIII/1973.- 306 -influence you have within them. All these factors are considered in evaluatingyour suitability for thePriesthood and the ways in which your magical expertise might best be applied inthe future.I have asked Reverend Grumboski to consider hosting the Fifth Eastern Conclavein the east thiscoming Halloween. In that case I hope you will work with him as much aspossible. It will be an excellentprelude to the International Conclave, and it will also provide us with anindication of our Canadianmembers’ interest in such a gathering. It would be unwise to commit ourselves toa national or multinationalmeeting unless we anticipate sufficient interest.Mission Santa Barbara does have two bell towers. Offhand I cannot think ofanother mission with a likenumber, but I am personally familiar with only five or six of them. Whenjourneying along the coast as ayoungster, I would make it a point to stop at “my” mission - San Miguel. Sincethat time I have often musedon the irony of being named for Satan’s ancient enemy. It would seem anindication that we may rely uponvery few constants. 575Mention of St. Michael had turned Hollander’s thoughts to literary Satanism inhis next missive:To take up your train of thought on Paradise Lost, I have always preferred thecharacter of Satan, whowould rather rule in Hell than serve in Heaven, to that of Archangel Michael andthe other sycophants of theHeavenly host. On this point you might like to read Daniel Defoe’s History ofthe Devil. And you might beamused by the following excerpt from St. Fidgeta and Other Parodies by JohnBellairs:“The Econophanic Heresy: Followers of this aberrant fantasy claimed that therewas, in addition to theTreasure House of Grace, a Treasure House of Sin, drawn on by the Devil and hisDemons. They elaboratedthis system to include Demonic comptrollers, tellers, guards, and vicepresidents. It was not long before thissect became explicitly demonic, as Econophanes went about waving checks drawn ontheir Hellish accountsand claiming that Satan gave higher interest rates. Fortunately the wholemovement collapsed when wordgot round that a run on the bank had occurred. The Econophanes were foundsitting on curbstones orstumbling aimlessly along, their faces those of ruined men.” 576For this enjoyable tidbit the least I could do was return the service:While I am familiar with Defoe, I had not come across the St. Fidgeta work thatyou mentioned. TheEconophanic anecdote was most amusing. The least I can do is quote Alfred, LordTennyson in return:The Devil:I remember meWhen I was summon’d up by this same MagusAnd unto this same office (’twas the deadOf a most chilly winter) that I litI’ th’ grey o’ th’ morning on a blue nos’d MonkAnd pluck’d him by the beard, whereat he shrunkIn all his sinews like a sensitive plantAnd chatter’d from the bottom of his cowl‘Apage Sathanas iniquissime!’Whereat I tripp’d him up and laid him proneHolding close conference with his Mother EarthAbout the damage of his splinter’d nose,And having punch’d him fundamentallyWith my strong hooves, I left him bruised and batteredAs a beefsteak. 577575 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Stephen Hollander, June 17, VIII/1973.576 Letter, Stephen Hollander to M.A. Aquino, June 20, VIII/1973.577 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Stephen Hollander, July 1, VIII/1973.- 307 -Hollander’s next letter got down to more serious business. As an aspirant to thePriesthood, he hadbeen attempting to publicize the Church of Satan in Canada and had met withlimited success. In hisefforts he had also uncovered the surprising fact that there were still lawsagainst “witchcraft” in Canada. Ihad visions of his being burned at the stake for holding a Grotto meeting andwrote him for details. Heanswered:As to the laws which I mentioned, the witchcraft statute is contained in C-34RSC 323. Section (a) isparticularly applicable. As far as I have been able to determine, no prosecutionhas ever been entered underthis section, although people have been convicted under (b) and (c). It is myopinion that no prosecutionunder section (a) could carry, as the words “fraudulently” and “pretends” areopen to variousinterpretations, although a court could conceivably rule that, as this sectionappears in the area of theCriminal Code dealing with false pretences, the fraudulent pretence to practicewould have to involve aconsideration. I am also enclosing a copy of C-34 RSC 211, which might bepertinent under certain bizarrecircumstances.The matter of licensing clergymen is a provincial responsibility, but I believethat Ontario’s regulationsare representative. A clergyman, in order to be authorized to solemnizemarriages, must register with theappropriate minister. In fact this registry is handled by the Deputy ProvincialSecretary. If the clergyman inquestion belongs to a church or denomination which is not listed by theSecretary, he must provideinformation regarding this church or denomination for the purposes ofdetermining if it should be listed.Organizations are not normally listed unless they have been in existence for atleast 25 years. Onlyclergymen representing listed organizations may be licensed to solemnizemarriages. Anyone who pretendsto solemnize a marriage without such license is guilty of a criminal offenseunder the Criminal Code. Whatthis means for now is that Canadian members desiring a Satanic wedding ceremonymust first be “marriedlegally” before a magistrate or registrar. This is the standard procedure forall religious ceremonies in manyEuropean countries.578The conclusion seemed to be that Canada’s anti-witchcraft laws, quaint thoughthey might be, werehardly a deterrent to the formation of a Grotto. Hollander vowed to persevere,but he was never successfuland a Church of Satan Grotto never was established in Canada (or in any othernon-U.S. country).Anton LaVey wrote two articles for the July-August Cloven Hoof. The first onewas entitled “TheMagical Personality” and likened magic to a “combination lock” which requiredthe entering of an exactcombination to work. This combination is achieved by every practitioner in a wayunique to himself,Anton continued, and success in Workings also requires the magician’ssensitivity to “combinations”which are occurring without his deliberate effort:Spatial concepts are an example of the Combination. The fourth dimension existsin time. If the otherthree dimensions are placed in correct combination, the fourth may be obtained.The first, second, and thirddimensions are essential keys to attainment of the fourth. All “supernatural”phenomena occur within thefourth dimension, hence in each instance the spatial or physical boundaries ofthree dimensions must bepresent in suitable combination to effect said phenomena.Every occurrence happens somewhere. It is that “somewhere”, in combination withthe magicianserving as a catalyst, which makes the untoward occur. “Somewheres” need not bespecialized enclosures inthe obvious sense (pyramids, etc.), but can be fields, cliffs, streets, woods,and rivers, as well as structures.Just as a rainbow is composed of harmonics of light, it is “somewhere” relativeto our vantage point;though were we to enter into its apparent field, it would no longer visiblyexist. Hence the only way to see arainbow is from afar - yet it still exists. The trick played by the rainbow,with its pot of gold waiting at itsbase, is the story of man’s delusion and disappointment. The magician mustrealize that his search does notend at the base of the rainbow; he must bypass it for that “somewhere” over therainbow. 579578 Letter, Stephen Hollander to M.A. Aquino, August 22, VIII/1973.579 LaVey, Anton, “The Magical Personality” in Cloven Hoof #V-4, July-AugustVIII/1973.- 308 -The High Priest’s second essay was a brief discourse on “The Greatest StoriesEver Told”, by way ofresponse to continuing requests for him to recommend literary works. [He hadlast issued an officialreading list for the Church of Satan in 1971.] Now he remarked:When I think of a purely Satanic work, it is of one which contains such complexallegory as to requireintelligence while reading, yet remain readable to an almost childlike level ofcontinuity. It must contain Alland One. Its statement must be as the sound of the world - so profoundly andinfallibly correct that tounderstand each line must either drive one mad or set one straight, dependingupon the reader’s stability …First on my list is The King in Yellow, for it is the work of a writer of cheapromances who becamedemonically possessed after being involved in espionage work of a delicatenature, the implications ofwhich are still cycling. Chambers, in his literary emergence from theImpressionists of his day, cast a die forLovecraft, Orwell, Huxley, and many others. Yes, the reading of The King inYellow in its entirety can driveone mad, if one realizes the insidiousness of the thing. 580Anton went on to recommend Charles Finney’s The Circus of Dr. Lao and NathanaelWest’s A CoolMillion.The former is the story of a traveling circus which arrives suddenly in a smalltown in the Arizonadesert. It is a very unusual circus, including among its attractions a satyr,Apollonius of Tyana, a Gorgon, amermaid, a roc, a chimæra, a sea-serpent, and a werewolf. Its main show includessuch exotica as awitches’ sabbath - complete with personal appearance by Satan - and thesacrifice of a virgin to anobscure, ancient god-idol.Now all of this seems suspect to the citizenry of the town. The wonders beforetheir eyes affect themas just so much more snake-oil. And they certainly don’t trust the odd littleChinaman, Dr. Lao, who hasbrought this odd institution into their midst.Lao himself is comparably enigmatic. One moment he is a bumpkin, jabbering in“Chinese pidginEnglish”. The next minute he delivers a learned dissertation as though in anOxford lecture hall. Theparallel between the Circus of Dr. Lao and the Church of Satan is not difficultto see - unless you happento be an “Arizona townsperson”, of course!If Dr. Lao reminded Anton LaVey of the more socially significant profile of theChurch of Satan, thenA Cool Million was a reflection of a different sort. It is an outrageous butsober parody on the “rags toriches” stories of Horatio Alger.West’s hero, Lemuel Pitkin, starts out as a country oaf, sets out to make hisfortune in urban America,and is calmly defrauded, robbed, imprisoned, and even physically dismembered.Throughout all of this hemaintains an innocent optimism and a faith in the “land of opportunity”. When heis finally killed - byaccident - he is memorialized as an American hero and speeches are made in hishonor.Anton LaVey had long been accustomed to his mocking Dr. Lao armor, but beneaththat harsh exteriorwas also a visionary and an idealist who refused to stop hoping that the Churchof Satan would indeedbecome the proving-ground for a nobler and more truly divine humanity. One ofthe key reasons for ourlong and close friendship was simply that I too was motivated by this ideal. In1973 Anton gave me a giftcopy of A Cool Million, which he had inscribed: “To Mike - from one potentialLemuel Pitkin to another.”By August 1973 Dale Seago had left the Marine Corps and had moved from NorthCarolina to Texas.He considered using a pseudonym for his Church of Satan activities and wrote toask my advice. Ianswered:You are free to employ a pseudonym if you so desire, but I personally recommendagainst it.Psychologically a pseudonym implies that you are vulnerable to condemnation orcriticism. Anyone whoreally wants to do you damage will sense this, and it would not be all that hardfor him or her to ascertainyour true identity and initiate a campaign against you.580 LaVey, Anton, “The Greatest Stories Ever Told” in Cloven Hoof #V-4,July-August VIII/1973.- 309 -If you use your true name right from the start, it will be assumed that you haveno worries about jobsecurity, personal safety, and so forth. Your projection will be one of strengthrather than weakness, and Isuspect that few would be willing to draw attention to themselves by baitingyou.During my first few months as a Priest in Louisville, I employed the pseudonymof “Charles DexterWard”. It proved impossible to maintain it without going through extraordinarytrouble, and finally Icommenced using my true name. I felt much better about it, never regretted thedecision, and have neverused a false name in public or private since that time. 581August also brought formal charters for Michael Grumboski’s Phœnix Grotto inDetroit and ThomasHuddleston’s Typhon Grotto in Dayton. In New York the Lilith Grotto continuedits fast-paced promotionsof the Church, as exemplified in an August letter from Lilith Sinclair:Things have been hectic here recently; the news media have kept me going incircles. Monday night Idid the John Wingate “Nightbeat” show over WOR radio from midnight to 2 A.M. Thefollowing night I didtwo hours via telephone [groan!] on WWDC radio in Washington, D.C.: the “EmpathyShow” from 10 tomidnight. Saturday brought a two-hour interview with photographs for the CourierNews (an AP paper), andon September 13th I’m scheduled for a lecture at Queens College in New YorkCity. Then on October 28th Ihave a lecture to give for Mensa. 582Over the Labor Day weekend I traveled to San Francisco for one of mystill-infrequent visits to 6114.As usual, Anton and I outlasted Diane, talking through the night until six inthe morning. Diane observed:It was just great seeing you. Since your long-overdue pow wow with Anton, everytime somethingcomes up and I say anything to show apprehension over a matter of administrivia,he says, “Don’t worryabout it; Mike knows what I mean,” -or- “Mike will understand why.” I feel theelectricity of what’s afootall around me. So glad you two finally had a chance to “commune” for once, andI’m looking forward toseeing the results!583Those results mostly concerned the Cloven Hoof. It will be recalled that, uponmy move to SantaBarbara in mid-1972, the decision had been made to upgrade the Hoof from themimeographed “red goat”format to an offset-printed “digest”. The digests were very well received, butthey were slow andexpensive to print.Anton felt that the Hoof could get its message across in a four-page bulletinformat, and fromSeptember 1973 to June of 1975 I designed them accordingly. In a Septemberletter to Lilith Sinclair Idiscussed the new concept:In San Francisco an extensive evaluation of the Cloven Hoof was once againundertaken. While we arepleased with the appearance and contents of each “digest” issue, it is evidentthat the newsletter is nothaving a truly Satanic effect upon the general membership. Were this the case,we would be receivingletters, questions, articles, and general comments that build upon the topicsintroduced in the Hoof. This hasnot been the case. The majority of the membership seem to accept the new issueevery two months, give it aquick glance, file it [or throw it away], and continue to ignore thephilosophical and creative standards itadvocates.We are well aware that there are many exceptions. These are the truly creativeindividuals who deserveto be called magicians in their own right. Paradoxically enough, such personsare past the point where they581 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, August 14, VIII/1973.582 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, August 27, VIII/1973.583 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 6, VIII/1973.- 310 -need magical stimulus on a bimonthly basis. They are self-activating. I imaginethat such individuals enjoythe Hoof as far as it goes, but that its effective contribution to the patternof their lives is severely limited.To sum all this up, the Hoof [and to a certain extent the entire Church] hasbeen making a mistake. Wehave been trying to explain Satanism to those who are unable to comprehend it ontheir own, rather than touse the paper as a means of keeping in touch with those who are self-activatedSatanists. Of course the Hoofhas enjoyed some success as an educational medium, but we are still working atcross-purposes to our corephilosophy.The Church of Satan should not be a school for non-Satanists. It should be aforum for those whoalready are Satanists.Consequently we are instituting some very radical alterations in both thenewsletter and the approach tomembership. Rather than attempting to inspire persons to apply for membership,we are going to tighten ourstandards even more. The end result will be that we will select those whosebehavioral patterns bear themark of the Devil, and we will inform them that they have been approved formembership in the Church ofSatan.Those who apply for membership in the usual fashion will follow thequestionnaire procedure. A highsocial or executive position will not be a hard and fast requirement, as we willevaluate potential as well asresults achieved to date. But the key concept will be one of recognition, not ofindoctrination. IndeedSatanism (= creativity) is so diverse that it cannot be either taught ordelineated. It is an infinite art, and weabuse it when we try to limit it. The genius of the Satanic Bible is that itprovides Satanists with a commonmeeting ground of a totally nonrestrictive nature. 584The First Western Conclave in San Jose had differed from its easterncounterparts in that it was anassemblage primarily of members at large, not a gathering of Grottos. FollowingWest-I a letter on thisaspect of the Church arrived from Bill Murray:In the overall picture there are advantages and disadvantages to both. I feelthat the “chapel movement”,if it could be called that, takes up the slack between the two. The advantage ofthe multi-regional Conclaveis that it brings together those who can afford to - to at least meet and expandtheir horizons.The western Church has always been much more of an independent movement than itscounterpart inthe east. One of the reasons for this trend was that you were in Louisville,Lilith is in New York, Bob Ethelin Washington, Dale Seago in the Carolinas, and of course that lovable madmanShai in Detroit.Also I find that the “actives” of the eastern Church are just that: active andgroup-minded as opposed towe westerners, who are of a more independent mind. Now that Dale Seago isfunctioning in Houston andthat the Detroit/Dayton/Cleveland complex is really blossoming, I foresee atremendous development in the“midwest multi-region”.It must be an interesting experience for you to have spent some time in the eastand been a part of itsways - and now to be out here in the “wild west”. Incidentally Nevadans areworse than Californians whenit comes to independent movements. I look at my own Regional Agency and see somevery independentthought, which Satanically I consider very healthy. “Mother” Keller is anexcellent example. Floyd andCindy Davis are all but “homesteading” near Las Vegas, and Tom Knapp (“Moloch”)is in the Los Angelesarea [but should be considered a Nevadan as far as his sympathies areconcerned]. Incidentally he will beout here today for a visit.The next few months are going to be busy ones for me in that Carpathia will behaving a constantstream of guests. Margaret Wendall and crew will be here over the Labor DayRodeo whoopie, and inSeptember Knapp will return again, accompanied by the Davises. Keller just wroteto say that she would beup here next weekend for a conference, and yesterday I received a very crypticnote from Jim and DoloresStowe stating that, in the not too distant future, they would take the trail tohere.After a year and a half of Satanic isolation, this place is going to get toodamn crowded! I love it! And Iam honored that my friends in the Church would want to come all this way just tosee me. 585584 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lilith Sinclair, September 7, VIII/1973.585 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, August 18, VIII/1973.- 311 -The LaVeys, who had more or less successfully kept Murray isolated prior toWest-I, were nowbecoming apprehensive at the speed with which he seemed to be working his waytowards the center ofChurch communications. In early December Diane advised me:Anton has decided that Murray is bad news. Please do not answer his latestletter nor any in the futureunless you check with us first. 586I responded:From my impression of Bill Murray in Santa Cruz (West-I), I don’t feel that he’sdeliberately trying tobe heavy-handed or insolent. He just has an overblown idea of (a) his own witand (b) the importance inwhich others hold his opinions. And, as I mentioned to Margaret Wendall, he hasa streak of Leo Martello inhim in that he’d like nothing better than to be a clearing-house for Church ofSatan gossip.I honestly don’t know what to do about him. On one hand he’s producing anewsletter and other items,seems to have brought some life to the Nevada area, has built himself quite anextensive ritual facility, andin general lives, breathes, eats, and drinks Satanism. On the other hand he’s,well, Bill Murray!587A comment arrived from Michael Grumboski, who hadn’t been at West-I but who hadmet the WildWest Warlock by correspondence and via copies of his newsletter, Children of theNight:With regard to Warlock Murray, I have seen a slight incident of the problem youmentioned. Viapersonal correspondence he made a passing statement concerning the equality ofWarlocks and Priests.Since my reply he hasn’t repeated the error - at least not to me. Damn - I maynot be the best in my field,but the hours of effort devoted to the Phœnix Grotto and to Changes IV make myblood boil when someonetries to belittle any Priest’s efforts.Yep, we in “Motown” do meet for meeting’s sake. Hell’s bells, what does Murraythink is one of themain functions of a church? Sure, social activities take second place toeducation and ritual, but we have awonderful group and enjoy one another’s company.One local practice which helps is that I take my place as a Priest only at thealtar or at business, social,or public occasions which call for the office. 588By summer Dale Seago had settled down to a serious promotional effort for theChurch in Texas.Evidence of this appeared in the Austin American newspaper:Church of Satan’s Goals Explained- by David Frink, Staff WriterGEORGETOWN - Forget about resisting temptation and you are on your way toeternal damnation,right? Wrong, says Church of Satan Priest L. Dale Seago, who says lack of proofof a life after death is onereason his religion preaches “self-indulgence rather than abstinence”.Dressed in a conservative dark suit with a black ministerial collar, Seagolooked much like the Marinehe once was and the banker he is as he spoke to the opening session of an“Off-Center Religion” conferenceon the campus of Southwestern University Tuesday night.About 125 curious Southwestern students packed Bishop Memorial Union to hearSeago explain theChurch of Satan, its basis, and some of its practices.“Satanists don’t condone the use of drugs, perform human sacrifices, or violatevoluptuous virgins,”said Seago. “Our religion is perfectly legal. A Satanist is motivated by ahealthy self-interest and wants586 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, September 7, VIII/1973.587 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton & Diane LaVey, September 19, VIII/1973.588 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, September 24, VIII/1973.- 312 -power, success, and happiness in this life, not the hereafter. Nor do wevenerate the Devil as a hornedJehovah. Satan is a symbolic godhead of man at his highest potential, with nopower greater than himself.”Seago says the religion is called Satanism because the word “Satan” in Hebrewtimes meant “opposer”or “adversary”, and “we do represent a moral and philosophical opposition toChristianity”. Seagoexplained some of the ceremonial ritual in Satanism, saying that it is used to“strip away intellectual layersand let true emotions come to the surface of a person’s mind”.Seago says the religion, begun in San Francisco in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey,is not seeking toconvert Christians but is trying to build an elite group who want to bettersociety as it exists now. “Satanismis the vehicle for a full, rich, and satisfying life right here and right now,”he told the students.However, not all were impressed with the Priest from Houston. When Seago said hebelieved in noGod, one student yelled, “I’ll pray for you tonight!” 589A detailed letter from Dale reached Santa Barbara a few days later:The Southwestern University lecture turned out to be quite an interestingaffair. I think it was intendedto be a circus after all, at least as far as Dr. Walker was concerned - butthings backfired.I put everyone off-balance by dressing conservatively, and my hair is not muchlonger than it was in theMarine Corps.The visiting consultant for the entire session was Wayne A. Robinson, author ofthree or four books,former Pentecostal and present Methodist minister, and former Vice President ofthe Oral RobertsEvangelistic Association and of Oral Roberts University.The students listened to my talk quietly and with interest. When I finished,Robinson gave a response,which was part of the original format. He summarized my major points clearly andaccurately, then insertedhis right foot in his mouth to about mid-thigh and began frantically chewingwhen he called my speech “abunch of bullshit”.I was delighted, as this had the effect of immediately alienating the audiencefrom anything else he said.Of course I took pains to assist the process, remaining friendly but dignified.His response was concerned mainly with pointing out that Christianity is not therepressive institution Ipainted it to be, and then he came out with a bunch of neo-Christian humanism.After his response there was a brief break before my question-and-answersession. During the break thestudents and faculty had decided that I should have an opportunity for rebuttal,which in effect gave meboth the first and last word.Robinson had really hanged himself by declaring that he personally was not asupernaturalist and didnot believe in the traditional ideas of Heaven and Hell. I pointed out that hewas a perfect illustration ofwhat I had said in my speech about religionists’ attempts to humanize theirspiritual concepts. Christianityno longer being what it had been, why did they continue to call it by that name?Christianity is becomingmore Satanic all the time …From then on I had them eating out of my hand.There were the usual one or two fanatics - who were frowned upon by the rest fortheir obstruction of aserious discussion. Whenever Robinson tried to attack me in some way, members ofthe audience spoke upin protest. At the end, Robinson was being loudly called a hypocrite by one ofthe most vociferouschampions of Christian values. Even one of the faculty members spoke up in thisvein. While they[expectedly] did not agree with everything I had said, they were definite intheir dislike of Robinson.I was told afterward that both students and faculty were very much impressed,particularly the youngDr. Farley Snell, the university chaplain, who had set up the entire four-dayconsultation. I was treated as ahighly-educated visiting dignitary, which is how I was told I came across.Frankly I am almost obscenely pleased about the whole affair. A student with avery strong interest inour scientific approach to the occult even asked me for my autograph - in hisbiology text, at the beginningof the chapter on the cat!590589 Austin American, Austin, Texas, September 26, 1973.590 Letter, L. Dale Seago to M.A. Aquino, September 30, VIII/1973.- 313 -To which I responded:I was absolutely delighted to learn of the success of your visit toSouthwestern, but, quite frankly, I wasnot all that surprised.If you can still get the chain of your III° medallion over your head, I have theutmost confidence in yourability to come out on top in any challenge you may see fit to accept. That’srather a broad statement, but Imean it explicitly. 591Dale was being assisted in his efforts by two energetic II°s, Paul and DianePipkin of Fort Worth. Inearly October they were interviewed for the Forth Worth Star-Telegram byreporter John Makeig(Appendix #87). It was Makeig’s first but not last encounter with the Church ofSatan.Lilith Sinclair was also in the news again - in a four-page story, accented byred flames and no fewerthan nine portrait photographs - in New Jersey’s Courier-News on September 8th(Appendix #88). In earlyOctober Lilith wrote to me:I visited the Phœnix Grotto in Detroit during the weekend of October 6th, and Ifound Shai’s group tobe absolutely delightful. They have quite a bit of creative talent among them,and they really pull together.It was a hectic two days - I believe I got a total of six hours’ sleep - butwell worth the trip.They made me most welcome, and I had the chance to observe them in ritual. Onthe whole I think theyreflect great credit on the Church of Satan.I also attended a local Star Trek convention with them and found it great fun -all those people withblue, green, and silver faces, and in the most outlandish costumes!In answer to your request for my opinion, I feel Ron Barrett to be an excellentcandidate for thePriesthood. I have been able to observe him both in Grotto surroundings and indealings with the generalpublic, and he is well-received in both situations. I had planned to recommendhim for the Priesthood assoon as I received the Articles of Protocol containing the revised proceduresfor this. He is well-respectedand carries his own weight in the Lilith Grotto, and he’s a most excellentspokesman at lectures.Two other possibilities are Linda Thomas and Mike McQuown. Both of them havebeen involved inextensive work with the Grotto and are dependable and reliable when needed. Theytoo have shownthemselves to be excellent representatives of the Church of Satan. 592On October 29th Lilith and Warlock Tom Bari from her Grotto lectured at ameeting of thePhiladelphia Ethical Society, while the previous day Michael McQuown had alsolectured on behalf of theGrotto at a major symposium of the New York Mensa society. Tom Bari had nowbegun the organizationof a sub-unit of the Lilith Grotto, the Schamballah Circle in Philadelphia. Itsinitial membership consistedof five members, among whom was a future Priestess named Yole Patterson.Michael Grumboski had previously advanced the name of Tom Huddleston for III°consideration; nowin October another letter from him reached me:I have told Tom Huddleston that his name is being presented for III°consideration. Needless to say, hewas surprised and pleased. In later discussion, up popped the question ofColleen. Tom is quite qualified;but then Colleen has shared in the joys and workloads of his Typhon Grotto andother undertakings. I lookforward to your ideas on the subject. 593I expressed those ideas in a letter to Anton LaVey a few days later:591 Letter, M.A. Aquino to L. Dale Seago, October 8, VIII/1973.592 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, October 15, VIII/1973.593 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, October 15, VIII/1973.- 314 -Per Shai’s letter I would 100% endorse sending a copy of the III° examination toboth Tom and ColleenHuddleston. From what I know of them, they have regularly worked as a team. Ihave met them both, and Ithink they would be a good bet.In New York I think we might consider sending the examination to Ron Barrett andMike McQuown.From my personal impressions of them, I think that both of them - andparticularly Barrett - are strongenough to carry our flag in the vicinity of such types as Martello and Buckland.Stuart Levine is thoughtfuland efficient, but he seemed to me to be the background type. I can’t see himtelling off Martello in adebate, in other words. But I can see both McQuown and Barrett doing just that.Barrett in particular looksso damned sinister that someone like Buckland would come off like a mouse besidehim.As we discussed earlier, both Barrett and McQuown have question-marks againstthem - Barrettbecause of his AC/DC status and McQuown because of his history of being nosy andsomewhat impudent.From my personal meetings with both individuals in New York, however, I aminclined to discount bothobjections. Barrett appears as normal as anyone else you might meet, and he doesnot bring his personal lifeto Church functions. I would not have guessed him to be homosexual until I askedhim pointblank, andLilith Sinclair tells me that he gets along freely and easily with persons ofboth sexes.I also think we might take a chance on Mike McQuown. In New York he came acrossas being dignifiedand actually rather reserved. Perhaps his earlier behavior had something to dowith the antics of Van Nessand Solomon, whose methods must have kept them in the center spotlight most ofthe time. At any rateMcQuown seems to have come up quite a bit."},{"pageContent":"While Lilith is certainly doing a tremendous job in New York, I don’t think itwould hurt our image tohave one or two Priests there as well. If you should concur, please send me theexaminations and I will takeit from there. 594 [index_split_012.html#p314]For the First Eastern Conclave in Centerville, Ohio I had composed a specialritual entitled the“Celebration of Death” (Appendix #49). I had assumed that no copies other thanmy own had survived,but Tom and Colleen Huddleston had exhumed one for East-V in Cleveland.Colleen rendered the entire ritual in beautiful, illuminated-manuscriptcalligraphy on parchment andsent it to me as a gift from the Conclave. Feeling it too beautiful to keep tomyself, I engaged a localblueprint firm to produce high quality photocopies, also on oversize parchment -one for the Huddlestonsand one for Anton and Diane LaVey. Diane wrote:What a beautiful job Colleen Huddleston did on the “Celebration of Death”ritual! Thanks so much forhaving it copied for us. I can imagine the cost for such reproduction. I didn’tknow she had this hiddentalent. I’ll show our copy to John Ferro, as he also is a calligraphy buff andwould love to see it. I expectAnton will drop Colleen a note of praise for it.The Huddlestons seem to be a terrific couple, and we agree that Tom should takethe III° test. The onlytrouble is that the old test is now, by the publication of the Satanic Rituals,all but outdated. Do you want totake a crack at compiling a new one from the ideas submitted by CharlesSteenbarger and yourself? 595 [index_split_012.html#p314]I was indeed willing to compile the new III° test, which turned out to be, asthe LaVeys anticipated,100% “my ideas”. This test (Appendix #89) was the final version used by theChurch of Satan. Per myrecommendation it was sent to both Tom and Colleen Huddleston, as well as toother candidates for thePriesthood from 1973 to 1975.By this time I had become something of a local celebrity in Santa Barbara, andin due course the localnewspaper, the Santa Barbara News-Press, approached me for a story. The result(Appendix #90), a full-page story with two photographs, appeared on my birthday (October 16th).Reaction was uniformlyfavorable, save for one letter to the Editor:594 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, October 19, VIII/1973.595 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 11, VIII/1973.- 315 -Editor, News-Press:In the recent write-up about the Church of Satan, we are glad to note that youmentioned that there isonly one member of this subversive group in our city of Santa Barbara.Nevertheless, as stated in God’sword: “Therefore, to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it issin.”(James 4:17)As foretold in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, particularly in thebooks of Daniel andRevelation, we can see that we are in the period of time referred to repeatedlyas “the latter days”. Asspecifically pointed out in Revelation 12:12, “… Woe to the inhabiters of theEarth … for the Devil is comedown unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a shorttime.”(King James version)Only a certain type of tabloid [which the Santa Barbara News-Press is not]aggrandizes such anindividual as this Aquino. In such a write-up, certainly no approval should beimplied in the manner ofpresentation any more than with a rapist, murderer, or dope dealer. Since thetime that Lucifer rebelled andwas cast out of Heaven with almost one-third of the Angels whom he had been ableto deceive with hislying propaganda, this Earth has belonged to him; and, as Christ knew before Hecreated this planet, He hadto come to die for our sins in order to make redemption possible, for all havesinned …Maurita Brown596My feelings were hurt. I wrote a response to Maurita as follows:While I appreciate your having sufficient courage of your convictions to send aletter to the News-Pressconcerning the Church of Satan, I rather resent being likened to a “rapist,murderer, or dope dealer”. Ibelieve the article made it quite clear that the Church of Satan firmly upholdsthe principles of law andorder, both in its doctrines and in the membership qualifications it maintains.Permit me to suggest that it is such bigotry as yours which was responsible forthe torture and murder ofmore than two million persons accused of witchcraft by Christians between thefourteenth and seventeenthcenturies. And this does not include the countless numbers of people butcheredduring the Crusades and theconquest of Central and South America in the name of Christ. Truly Jesus spokecorrectly when he said,“Think not that I am come to send peace on Earth: I come not to send peace but asword.” (Matthew 10:34)For my part I have done no harm to you or yours, nor do I wish anything but alifetime of happiness toyou. I think you would do well to examine the hatred and bitterness in yourheart, and then ask yourselfwhether you or I more truly personify the nobler aspects of humanity.597As the city with the two-bell-tower mission was contemplating its unsuspectedrole in the Age ofSatan, a surprise letter arrived from Linda Thomas, who had joined throughSteenbarger’s Denver-basedPlutonian Grotto and then moved to New York City and the Lilith Grotto:First let me thank you for this opportunity to communicate with you.I’m becoming a touch frustrated about things. I see myself inside of a moving,mirrored, angular,orgone box. Each moment becomes infinite and therefore loses its place in myintellect. I’m sure you mustknow what an incredible [is anything incredible anymore?] adjustment it is totry living this way. Living inNew York City in the 20th century, U.S.A., Planet Earth.Don’t get me wrong - I love it. It’s just that things have become so changed. Myeyesight has becomeso spread out - my nerve center like a web of kinetic energy, sparkling blue andsilver. I am becomesomething I was not, yet have always been. In other words these changes I amexperiencing are unusual butnot alien. I seem to known them; do you know what I mean. Sigh! I wasn’t alwaysthis way. I was normalonce - ha, ha!After I returned home from my summer trip in late August, Lilith - may she liveforever! - gave mesome mind-exploding, psyche-rending information about many, many things. Sincethen I have beenevolving/revolving at such a rate that I am something I have never been beforein all of the 21 Earth years Ihave lived.596 Letter, Maurita Brown to Santa Barbara News-Press, October 19, 1973.597 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Maurita Brown, October 22, VIII/1973.- 316 -A few “for instances”: I am in ecstasy. No other word describes what I seem tobe feeling - it’s sounusual - I can’t seem to be unhappy.I did a ritual on September 23: the first of a series of destruction rituals toimpede the influence ofJehovah and just to let him know that I am not about to stand for any of histricks. In fact I intend to existlong enough to see every trace of him wiped off the Earth. You see, he committeda few personal sinsagainst me, and besides that he’s a miserable rat who deserves to beacupunctured to death.After that I was somewhat barraged with problems of one sort or another. Buthaving proclaimed mystance on the side of the Father of Dæmons, I was miraculously untouchable. Nodisaster, no matter of whatdegree, stifled me in the least. My eyes are like sparkling jewels, alive withlife. My whole inner being islike a flame, and “strength through joy” burns out of me: “Miss WalkingLightning Bolt”.What can I say? No one knows a joy greater than mine. I am a solitary diamond,united only to thosewho are like unto me. This is essentially true. I have many families; but I haveno family, save those whomI have named Brother or Sister according to their capabilities. My life is onebig Deadly Sin.I have always been, and am still alone, essentially and more or lesscontentedly. I have no greatreligious background. All of my family were either too drunk, too busy, or toohappily oblivious torecognize a god. My mother was an alcoholic Indian; my father I never met; mystepfather was an alcoholicIrishman; and my various foster-keepers were of mixed Navajo, Apache, andMexican lineage. What awonderfully varied and delightful preparation. Each experience in my life,joyful or painful, has enhancedme a thousandfold, until 2 A.M.So there you have it - a little background, some current experiences, and a fewinteresting tidbits hereand there. I do have aspirations for the Priesthood. Lilith feels I’m quiteready, and so do I. What do youthink? 598Before answering, I asked Lilith Sinclair for her opinion, and a few days laterit arrived:A short time ago you had asked my opinion of Linda Thomas with regard to theIII°.Linda’s letter to you is typical of her. She goes from absolute ecstasy tosilent irritation and impatientdissatisfaction with life in the course of a day or two. She is well-liked byall of us in the Grotto, is excellentas the altar, and is warm and friendly to the group. She is just too mercurialand impulsive, however. She isquite young - just about 21 - and so needs a bit of time to settle down. Herstatement that I considered herready for the III° stems from a discussion we had in which she asked my opinion.I told her that I felt shehad potential, but that she would have to get herself together more and that Iwould be more than happy tohelp her. However I do not feel that she is ready at this time, and her letterconfirms it. 599So I wrote to Linda:No, you haven’t lost your mind, and I do in fact understand the frustration youfeel. Both sensationshave been experienced by many Satanists. What you are going through is besttermed an existential crisis.For a lucid description of this, see Jean-Paul Sartre’s book Nausea, a classicwork of existentialism.Christians, Jews, or others who view their lives as missions assigned to them bya God or gods neednever analyze their own existence. They simply function as “good soldiers”,carrying out the tasks assignedto them - and observing the ethics taught to them - without question.The Satanist has no such luxury and must consider existence as a personaluniverse over which he orshe has godlike control. This is a terrifying realization - one which has simplybeen too much for someSatanists, causing them to seek once more the comforting dogma of conventionalreligion.This is a tremendous opportunity for you to seize complete control of your lifeand your destiny - toobtain a full realization of what exactly you are, what you can and cannot do,and what directions yourfuture should take. Do not fear it. It has always been there; you have justnever seen it before, that is all. Itis the Gift of Satan to Man.598 Letter, Linda Thomas to M.A. Aquino, October 20, VIII/1973.599 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, November 14, VIII/1973.- 317 -There is no single criterion by which candidates for the Satanic Priesthood areevaluated. Anaccomplished magician is mistress of all aspects of her life, not just themetaphysical ones. A Priestess mustbe in a respected and influential position in the social jungle, not only withinthe privileged confines of theGrotto of Satan.“As above, so below” is a magical aphorism which applies here. In a sense youmight say that theChurch of Satan has no power to “award” the Satanic Priesthood. What it doeshave is the Mandate toofficially recognize those who, by their own strength of will, have becomeSatan’s true representatives onthis Earthly plane of ours.From what I know of your history, you have already come a long way undercircumstances that werenot always kind to you. You had no one to help you but yourself, and you setyour jaw and persevered. Youhave much to be proud of, and the Archfiend’s regard for you is symbolized inthe highest honor that theChurch of Satan can confer upon an individual - the II° of Witch.But you have not attained the stability and position in your everyday existencethat is commensuratewith the image and responsibilities of the Priesthood. This must be your nexttask.If you think we are asking a lot, you are right. But this is because it is nosmall recognition on whichyou have set your sights. Moreover Satanism is a creed devoted to theindividual. What we ask, we ask foryou, not for ourselves. The benefit to the Church will come when, as an adeptand accomplished Priestessof Mendes, you will be in a position to instruct other, less powerful Satanistsaccording to the knowledgeand experience you have gained.May the Prince of Darkness walk with you. 600As it turned out, Linda Thomas’ magical potential had been simultaneouslyevaluated in a somewhatless cerebral context by Charles Steenbarger to Dale Seago. Seago had learnedthat Thomas had beenregularly hypnotized by Steenbarger and had queried him on this matter. InOctober Steenbargerresponded to Dale:1. I determined that she readily went into a somnambulistic trance.2. I then used the technique of inducing a hypnotic dream.3. Once I saw that I could make her dream under hypnosis, I induced a dream of aSatanic ritualstressing [because of her lustful predilections] union with the Arch-Demoncomplete with vivid, Gothic, andexciting imagery.4. With such a deep trance even a climax can be induced by suggestion only,because of the strongsense of reality the woman experiences through the hypnotic dream.5. After the dream ritual, I reinforced posthypnotic suggestions to the effectthat during any ritual shewould go from a light to a deep trance with the nine counts of the bell, andcome out of the trance graduallywith the bell at the end of the ceremony. During the ritual she was to translateeverything she heard into avivid dream which she could embellish with her own freewheeling imagination.- - -It is helpful to also remember that subjects respond best in accordance withtheir natural proclivities. Toimpose the lust theme upon a puritanical woman who is otherwise a good subjectwould probably beunfruitful.Also it is best to re-hypnotize the subject several times to entrench theposthypnotic ritual suggestions.And, of course, the posthypnotic cues (the bell) make the whole thingself-reinforcing with each ritualwherein she takes the honored role of altar.Each time Linda became progressively more responsive, the movements of her nudeform under theBaphomet and/or an inverted crucifix in a dimly candle-lit room added a sinisterand highly-chargedatmosphere to the entire ritual. The benefits to the altar associated with herpersonal development are toonumerous to list. 601600 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Linda Thomas, November 19, VIII/1973.601 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to L. Dale Seago, October 14, VIII/1973.- 318 -While the eastern membership of the Church of Satan celebrated Halloween VIII atthe East-VConclave in Cleveland, I journeyed south to Los Angeles. When in that city andnot staying with anacquaintance, the LaVeys were partial to the Hollywood Franklin Hotel, apleasant and privateestablishment a short distance away from the famous Hollywood and Vineintersection.Anton insisted on coffee at Tiny Naylor’s on Sunset Boulevard, which hemaintained was the“combination” of the 1950s’ drive-in. [It is indeed. He once again outraged hislong-suffering wife andreduced his admiring assistant to helpless laughter by leaving a beautifullyengraved calling card on thetable, its Gothic script proclaiming: GONE TO WEE WEE.]Anton and Diane had invited me to Halloween supper on board the Queen Mary, thefamous Cunardliner which now rests in the port of Long Beach. On the liner we engaged in along discussion, thesubstance of which I recounted in the November-December Cloven Hoof:Shortly before Halloween the Editor was in Beverly Hills for an audience withthe High Priest and HighPriestess. While we were discussing the social profile of the Church of Satan,1984 popped up in a moststartling manner. Dr. LaVey suddenly jumped to his feet, waved an emphaticfinger, and said, “Orwell drewthe blueprint!” He then strode from the drawing-room, reappearing a moment laterwith a well-read copy of1984, from which he quoted the following:“You understand that you will be fighting in the dark … I shall send you a bookfrom which you shalllearn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which weshall destroy it. When you haveread the book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood. But between thegeneral aims that we arefighting for, and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never knowanything. I tell you that theBrotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members,or ten million. From yourpersonal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many asa dozen.“You will have heard rumors of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt youhave formed your ownpicture of it. You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators,meeting secretly in cellars,scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by code words or byspecial movements of the hand.Nothing of the kind exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it isnot an organization in theordinary sense. Nothing holds it together except an idea which isindestructible. You will never haveanything to sustain you except the idea …“Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls ofdust and splinters of bone. Atpresent nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little bylittle. We cannot act collectively. Wecan only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generationafter generation.” 602Although by now sadly disillusioned by the many petty crises that had savagedthe Church of Satansince its inception, Anton still held hopes for its future. Nowhere are thesemore eloquently andidealistically expressed than in a speech (Appendix #91) that he made for arecord entitled The OccultExplosion, which was co-released in 1973 to follow a paperback anthology of thesame name [but withoutthe speech].The speech is Anton LaVey at his most sensitive, most thoughtful. Those whoheard his stridentreading of the “Book of Satan” on the Satanic Mass record of the Church’searliest San Francisco dayswere touched and impressed by the gentleness and scholarly acumen of thisrendition.Shortly after I sent the camera copy for the November-December Hoof to SanFrancisco for approval,the following arrived from Diane:Your opening article for this issue for this issue was perfect: enough needlesto produce some action,but also enough humor to put it across.Anton just handed me the following: “Cut Kesey’s book and the belly-dance book.Kesey has watchedall of my moves from the wings, employed some of his observations, and shown meselective inattention.602 Aquino, M.A., “Epilogue VIII, Prologue IX” in Cloven Hoof #V-6,November-December VIII/1973. Also Orwell, George, 1984. NewYork: Harcourt, Brace, 1949, Signet Edition pages #144-145.- 319 -When our ‘witches’ start following the trends of the Compleat Witch, then we’llworry about their bellydancing! Plug Westworld as a grim but prophetic glimpse of future Satanicprojects.”Anton LaVey had had a chip on his shoulder about Ken Kesey for some time, as Ilater discovered.Kesey, whose exploits are recounted in Tom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid AcidTest, was the West Coastdriving force behind the psychedelic movement of the mid-60s.Whether consciously or not, he happened to be in competition with that otherexotic enterprise in SanFrancisco, the newly-founded Church of Satan. In The Devil’s Avenger isrecounted at least one instancewhen a carefully-prepared ritual at 6114 had to be canceled because one or twoof the key celebrants optedinstead for a party at Kesey’s hideaway on Highway #84 in La Honda.Westworld was a newly-released horror/science-fiction film featuring androidsdesigned for humanentertainment, and thus dovetailed nicely into Anton’s plans for an actualenterprise along this line [seeChapter #15].After the Halloween weekend Anton had remained a little longer in Los Angeleswhile Diane returnedto San Francisco to keep the Central Grotto in order. Her letter continued withnews of Anton’s subsequentactivities:Yes, he certainly did return from Hollywood with some exciting news this time.Not liking to countchickens before they cross the road (or something like that), I’m not going togive you all the details. But hewas working with a well-known writer and our agent concerning plans for aprofessionally-done filmdocumentary on the C/S, which Anton would direct.Another project - a screenplay written by Anton and using the Avenging Angeltheme - was tossedaround quite seriously.And still another project: You’ll recall his telling you about an interestingwoman who had quite a taleto tell about a certain infamous German gent. Well, that is first on the agenda.He also had a good time with Forry Ackerman. 603Towards the end of November more pleasant news arrived from Lilith Sinclair. TheChurch of Satanhad just solemnized its third wedding:The Lilith Grotto had its first Satanic wedding on November 10. As I joined thecouple together, I trulyfelt the joy and power of being a Priestess of Mendes, and I was as moved asthey were. David and DorothyEstes are the couple; they have been with the Grotto for about a year and ahalf. 604The final months of 1973 were also the occasion for the renewal of an old andvalued acquaintance ofmine. On Halloween I had sent a card to John Ferro, whom I hadn’t seen orcontacted since thatmemorable Missa Solemnis in 1970. In late October a letter arrived from him.I must digress to say that letters from John Ferro were invariably on grey laidnote paper, penned inIndia ink and in graceful, flowing calligraphy. It must have taken him thebetter part of an evening to writea single letter, but, as will become evident, this did not perturb the writerone bit:Your gracious Halloween greetings have been gratefully received. It was indeedvery thoughtful of youto have included me in the list of those to be so greeted, and I take the factas an accolade.May I take the occasion not only as an opportunity to reciprocate thefelicitations, but also that I conveymy respectful appreciation of the excellent competency with which you havehandled the Cloven Hoof andso many of the Church’s affairs. Through your work and in the brief personalencounters, I have had every603 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 23, VIII/1973.604 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, November 25, VIII/1973.- 320 -reason to see why the High Priest places such confidence in you and so manyresponsibilities in your hands.Wishing you then, likewise, a very magical and festive high unholy day, Iremain,Respectfully yours,John A. Ferro605I answered:If you write me many more letters like that one, my head’s going to swell up tothe point where suchbrains as I have will ooze down into my throat, thus putting my mentality wheremy mouth is.As a matter of fact, one of the things I have regretted during the last severalyears is that there wasnever a sustained opportunity for the two of us to correspond. I expect that youwere entangled in researchtowards your doctorate, and I have had one or two monkeys on my back as well.When one is workingwithin the context of an organization such as the Church, it invariably seemsthat the troublemakers get allthe real attention. The decent types, predictably, keep their own affairs inorder. I have stacks of letterswritten to and about screwballs with whom we have had to deal, and no doubtthere is a multitude ofdignified and distinguished Satanists in all parts of the planet who have nevertroubled the Central Grottofor anything save the renewal of their membership.Some time ago Dr. LaVey informed me that you had voluntarily relinquished thedegree of MagisterCaverni, feeling the responsibilities of the office to be incompatible with thetime you had available todevote to it. While I can understand the reasons behind your decision, Icontinue to regard you personally asa Brother of mine in the Realm of the Masters. One may resign one’s titularoffice - but it is rather difficultto abrogate the intellect that qualified him for it in the first place. And, ofcourse, you are something of an“Old Bolshevik” in the Church - one of those who “stood at the barricades” whenthe Church was firstfounded. And that is not something to be lightly dismissed. 606This new dialogue brought a chuckle of amusement from Diane LaVey:So glad that you and John Ferro have established a chain of communication. Hehas expressed hisrespect for you many times and told us he couldn’t think of a better person forthe type of work you aredoing with the Church. Next time I see him, I think I’ll say, “How the hell areya, you Old Bolshevik,you?” 607John Ferro’s response, of course, was a tad more stately:That was, indeed, a fine letter to receive; I do thank you. I am pleased andhonored by your friendship,and gratified that a channel of correspondence has opened between us.Sometimes my language is a bit effusive, and I am verbose. I in fact ratherenjoy being such. However,I do not pay such compliments lightly. I meant what I said. You know the truthof it, else it would not pleaseyou.It is, on your part, kind and gracious to regard me in the Magister category.When I occupied thatposition, I had some success, many failures, but enough experience to appreciateboth the dimension ofyour commitment and the quality of your achievement. It is for that reason allthe easier for me to honoryou, which I do. Moreover the deep affection and respect in which I hold theHigh Priest would cause me tohonor those whom he honors and those who serve him well. In both instances youqualify eminently!May I take this opportunity to say how impressed I was by your publicityachievement. Excellent. Amagical coup. I think it had just the right admixture of the common and themysterious.605 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, October 18, VIII/1973.606 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John Ferro, October 26, VIII/1973.607 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 11, VIII/1973.- 321 -The last Cloven Hoof was much to my liking. As I said to the High Priestrecently, I think the moment isright, and it will preserve the psychic energy of the quality members of theOrder without diminishing the“herd”. If you provide the masses with more than they deserve, they not onlydespise you, they also begin toassume that they do deserve it!608Ferro was referring to an editorial tongue-lashing of mine in theSeptember-October Hoof, of which abrief extract will suffice:A $10 renewal fee does not buy membership in the Church of Satan. If that weretrue, we’d becollecting many times our existing fees from all those persons whom we haverejected as being unqualifiedfor our Church.The $10 figure is quite arbitrary; it could just as easily be $1 or $100. Thereal price of membership inthe Church of Satan is your soul (or your ego, presence of mind, etc.). Whatvalue do you place upon that?We ourselves feel that any person who places his confidence in us deserves everyopportunity we cangive him. But the success or failure of any magician is ultimately dependentupon his own strength,determination, and perseverance. 609Although John Ferro had continued to hold the Priesthood, he had not been activein the Church ofSatan since its San Francisco days. Our renewed contact reminded me of just howstrongly I had beenimpressed with his intellectual powers. At a time when the Church was strugglingto make the transitionfrom entertaining curiosity to serious philosophy, we needed every John Ferro wecould get. To DianeLaVey I wrote:It’s up to you, of course, but I’d kind of like to see John Ferro re-Recognizedas a recipient of the IV°.[I’ll even give him his IV° medallion back!] I’ve always thought of him as thefirst person to attain the IVůnder the ægis of the Church. Unless there are somefactors I know nothing about in his case, it would be nice to see this honorperpetuated. 610In late 1973 Robert Ethel had published a series of protocol guidelines for hisAsmodeus Grotto. Theyseemed particularly good to me, so I reproduced them and sent copies to all ofthe other Grotto leaders fortheir possible adaptation. John Ferro’s next missive dealt with this subject:I was pleased to receive a copy of the protocol for Asmodeus Grotto.As you may have assumed, I heartily agree that these regulations constituteminimal guidelines. It is anarduous and unrewarding occupation to enforce regulations, most especially onthis level of the firstinitiative.I am afraid that most people, and this most assuredly includes our membership,fail to comprehend theextended aspects of ritual behavior. Most willingly perform in formal liturgies,with varying degrees ofaptitude - or ineptitude, but few seem to be aware of the entire ritual in whicha liturgical action may be set.Certainly only a very few understand the ritual of life in its continuousprogression of ceremonial andfantasy.Forgive my ramblings. Any excuse seems acceptable to share a few thoughts.May the mighty Prince of Darkness continue to prosper all your works. 611608 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, October 30, VIII/1973.609 Aquino, M.A., “Hoofbeats” in Cloven Hoof #V-5, September-October VIII/1973.610 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, November 16, VIII/1973.611 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, November 26, VIII/1973.- 322 -In my response to him I brought up what was to be one of our central topics fordiscussion (by letter)during the subsequent year:You may or may not know that I am presently engaged in writing a book on Satanictrends throughouthistory. It will climax with an in-depth analysis of the Black Arts as currentlyconceived andinstitutionalized by the Church of Satan.The entire project should take me well over a year, since it must necessarilyoccupy a back seat to theCloven Hoof and my other responsibilities. Nevertheless I am in no hurry, as Iam not interested in churningout another “Hans Holzer special”.Ideally this work will be sufficiently sophisticated to hold its own in thephilosophy department of anymajor university. To date I have roughed out three chapters, and they treatSatanism with reference to thedoctrines of such theorists as Descartes, Berkeley, Hegel, Pythagoras, andPlato. Of course there are severalother actors waiting in the wings.On the material side of things, the book will approach operative magic in termsof stress-psychology(PSYOP, if you will), matter/antimatter, the biological mechanics of “life” and“death”, and quantumphysics relative to the creative and impulsive forces of the human will.Theologically oriented chapters willconsider the case for a Satanic super-intelligence which draws its life-forcefrom the collectivesubconscious of humanity (an idea which I believe to be the ultimate implicationof H.P. Lovecraft’swritings).I then turned to another topic:As well as I know you, I confess myself in ignorance of the actual degree towhich you are presentlyinvolved with the operations of the Church of Satan. During a taxicab-ride to aradio station in Chicago onthe evening of February 20, VI, Dr. LaVey told me that you had voluntarilystepped down from yourposition as Magister Caverni at the Central Grotto due to the demands of youracademic schedule. Sinceyou now have your Ph.D., are you able to reassume your office?You will excuse me if I am somewhat blunt concerning my reasons for advancingsuch an inquiry: Youare known to Satanists across the country as the first person to receive theFourth Degree from the Church.Your tenure with the Church makes you, as I observed in my last letter, an “OldBolshevik”. But, moreimportantly, you have the intellect, the judgment, and the dignity to direct thecourse of this movement on aworldwide scale. Were I not able to appreciate this, I should count myself acretin indeed.The time has come for use to decide whether the Church of Satan is ultimately ashort-term essay on thetheme of Rosemary’s Baby or a revolutionary approach to human philosophy andbehavior that can literallychange the course of history. Dr. LaVey has given the same impetus to thismovement that Washington andLenin gave to theirs, but he can’t do the whole thing alone. Like Washington andLenin he needs a closely-knit, highly-coordinated executive committee - in effect a Council of Nine thatfunctions on a continuousand aggressive basis.After five years’ experience with and exposure to the Church of Satan, I havemade the decision tomake it my life’s work. That does not mean that I am going to pursue it in theeasygoing manner of aMasonic or Kiwanis enthusiast either. By the time I die, I want to see thisinstitution so firmly situated thatit will be in a position to influence the course of human events for anindefinite period to come. And I fullyappreciate the scope of a statement like that. In the final analysis I see nopoint to existence unless we makesomething more of ourselves than mere metabolic systems. If I did not believethat there is a reasonableprobability that the core assumptions of Satanism are correct, I should beinclined to contemplate suicide -not out of emotion, but rather existential boredom.I am telling you all this because I would like to know just where you stand. Isthis a hobby for you, is itmore important than your life, or is it somewhere in between? I do not presumeto venture value judgmentsupon your position, whatever it is. But it would be helpful to have some ideaconcerning the courses ofaction you might be prepared to undertake on behalf of this movement. 612612 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John Ferro, December 9, VIII/1973.- 323 -Cheeky of me, I thought, but I was willing to risk uncovering old wounds to joltthis enigmaticSatanist back to life. He did not, however, jolt easily. Indeed his next letterwas even more charminglyantiquarian:Before addressing myself to the precise issues of our present exchange, pleaseindulge me in asuperfluous digression.You must excuse the almost total absence of typing in my correspondence; I onlyconcede when it isabsolutely demanded. I find pen and ink infinitely preferable to those ghastlymachines with their messyribbons and persistent, cacophonous chatter.Likewise, to further digress, a cabriolet, not to mention a state coach, is muchmore to my taste thanpetrol-propelled vehicles. Need I add that even the finest lamp cannot match thebeauty and modulatedlumination of a candelabrum? Enough! I have been indulged, so let us then to theheart of the matter.I should prefer to discuss the issues in what I consider to be their degree ofimportance, rather than inthe order in which you have unfolded them in your communiqué.For me, the most significant fact in the entire letter was your statement ofcommitment, of the decisionat which you had arrived vis a vis the Church of Satan. Certainly I had presumedsuch a commitment, but Iam indebted to you in that you have seen fit to verbalize to me personally. Ithank you. It is quite marvelousand magical, for it is the fulfillment of a prediction which the High Priestmade to me long ago, during thatperiod when I corresponded with you while you were in Vietnam.You have been all he said you would, already accomplished much of what heexpected you wouldaccomplish, and made the most significant and complete commitment of any singleindividual within theChurch, which he also said you would do.This leads me into, and is inextricably bound up with two other questions youraised: namely my statusand attitude.Yes, as we all know, I was the first person to be raised to the fourth degree ofthe Black Order. It is afact of which I am proud, and while I occupied that position I sincerelyattempted to discharge the dutiesincumbent upon me with some quality and success.When I stepped down it was, as the High Priest informed you, in order to pursuemy academic work.However it was not, as it might seem, a unilateral decision, but one taken withthe full concurrence of theHigh Priest. The one matter in which he disagreed was the specific moment. Itwas preferable to him that Iwait a while longer until you had been sufficiently groomed and your obligationssufficiently discharged sothat you might assume the official role to which your obvious talents and hisplans entitled you.Unfortunately the demands of my academic program precluded such a delay.Ultimately it has allworked out quite splendidly.Now to the second level of explanation. I do not, as you must know, give pithyresponses to much ofanything, certainly not to serious questions.As to my talents and my status: You have been kind, in fact excessively kind inacknowledging mytalents, but you have overlooked my limitations. This the High Priest has notdone. My talents lie in theareas of philosophical speculation, for want of more exact terminology, andritual. I simply do not possessyour capacity for institutional formation, your organizational ability. It isyou, and men like you, who areneeded. I am a dreamer, I am decadent, I am an effete academician. This does notdisplease me, and I amnot indulging in self-abnegation. I am affording you the blunt honesty whichyour inquiries merit.Perhaps a scene from past history will illuminate the issue. The last ritual atwhich I performed thefunction of Magister had been planned by me, in my academic manner, as acelebration of the great mastersof Satanic literature. It seemed so very appropriate to me given thecircumstances. At first the High Priestapproved, allowing me complete discretion. At the last moment he took a completereversal, interjecting avery different ceremony, one quite inimical to my psyche. I was very hurt.Later he explained to me that on a personal level it would have been mostfitting for me to celebrate inmy manner. It was not, he instructed me, right for the Church. His exact wordswere these, as I recall, asfollows: “It is wrong to celebrate the old and outgoing. We must celebrate thenew and upcoming.” It wasfor me a bitter dictum. I have lived to see and to understand the wisdom of it.- 324 -When I stepped down, I had the honor to retain the friendship and confidence ofthe High Priest, whichI greatly treasure. Given my particular training and skills, and participatingin the magical benefits of theThird Degree, I am able to perform various services for the High Priest. Some Iam sure you know, andothers are personal and private.As to the other questions you raised, some of the answers are personal and notmatters that can readilybe laid out on paper. We both have had sufficient exposure to the intricacies ofintellectual currents to beaware of the impossibility of any adequate simplistic evaluation.This much I can state emphatically: Satanic philosophy is not a hobby with me. Iabhor the wholeconcept of hobbies. In some matters I am more involved than others, but tosustain any serious study ofintellectual patterns and movements does not admit of the “hobby approach”.As to the other extreme, i.e. is it more important to me than life? No. But thenI am not an ideologue. Iam deeply involved in Satanism as a new thought current with real potentialitiesfor modern man.My approach is an intellectual and philosophical one, and I do not say that withany intentionalpomposity. I believe this justifies my association with the Church and with theHigh Priest. It has been thefoundation of whatever contributions I have made. Indeed, all of this the HighPriest could tell you, for heknows me very well. My mother is of the opinion that he knows me better than anyof my friends. I thinkthat is so!Finally, your book sounds most intriguing. I marvel at your capacity foraccomplishment. I would enjoydiscussing it with you, and would be happy to make any contribution possible. Asyou have outlined it, thework will be a formidable endeavor. 613My opportunity to nudge John Ferro from the frying pan back into the fire cameupon being invited to6114 for the Winter Solstice. My mother and I took Anton and Diane to anappropriately elegant dinner atSan Francisco’s “Russian Renaissance” restaurant, after which the LaVeysgraciously gave her a guidedtour of 6114’s exotica, culminating in a concert by Anton on his Yamaha organ.It is one of the world’s artistic tragedies that Anton LaVey never recordedclassical concert organselections for commercial release. He combined technical expertise with theuncanny ability to enter intothe soul of the composer of the piece he was playing. 614 I need hardly say thatthis is its own type of ritualmagic.One one occasion, when Charles Steenbarger (also an accomplished concertorganist) and I werevisiting 6114, Anton felt moved to play the accordion. It was insufficient justto play the instrument,however. To do it right he first had to don a floppy old hat and a pair of“blind man’s” dark glasses. Hisface crinkled into an appropriately detached smile, and magical music flowedforth from beneath hisnimble fingers. [See photo section.][I must further digress to observe that those fingers were a mystery all theirown. Anton LaVey’s handswere hardly those of a China doll. They were thick, with short, chunky fingers.They were the last handsone would expect to see dance with delicate precision over the keyboard of anorgan or accordion - yet Inever knew him to miss a note in the most complex passages.]Upon returning to Santa Barbara I posted a letter to the LaVeys New Year’s Eve:My mother has still not stopped talking about the marvelous time she had at6114, with heavy emphasison that colorful organ concert. This I could easily have predicted. She, ofcourse, was quite caught up in themagic of all those old tunes you revived for the occasion. My own tastes mightbe considered more coarse; Igot the biggest thrill out of the impromptu “PhAnton of the Opera” pantomime!613 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, December 21, VIII/1973.614 In the 1990s Amarillo Records (P.O. Box 24433, San Francisco, CA 94124)produced a phonograph record by Anton entitled StrangeMusic (#AM-586). By this time in his life, Anton had become enamored of keyboardsynthesizers, and this album consists solely of “loungemusic” tunes played with that device. While indicative of his keyboarddexterity, the flatness and artificiality of the synthesizer nowhere nearcompares to the rich depth of the concert organ, nor of course does SM containany classical pieces.- 325 -This is a reference to one point in the concert where, as Anton was executingsome particularlygloomy piece - “Black Swan” from Swan Lake or some-such - Diane tiptoedfurtively up behind him,ripped an imaginary mask from his face while he froze in sudden shock, and thenscreamed in terror as hespun round to grimace hideously at her! To continue:And it was also good, the previous evening, to renew acquaintances with JohnFerro.I don’t deny that I am intrigued by his evident reluctance to participate inmany of the First Century’stechnological innovations. It is a certainty that his position is aestheticallypreferable to that of the cold-hearted cybernaut, but I fear that he is attempting to withdraw from societyrather than to dominate it.This might be a realistic option in an earlier age, but today the fortunate andthe unfortunate must drinkwater from the same well. It seems to me that the only long-range hope for theSatanist lies in his ability tobend the mass of humanity to his will, not to avoid it and trust that it willnot tamper with his life-style. Itmay not persecute him deliberately, but he will nonetheless be affected by theexplosion of a thermonuclearwarhead in his vicinity … or even the tantrums of a few oil-controlling Arabs onthe other side of theplanet. 615John Ferro was no longer the pale, thin, animated ghost who had so terrifiedvisitors [including me] to6114 in 1969. He had put on a bit of weight, grown a beard, and looked a bitlike James Mason in 20,000Leagues Under the Sea. He wrote his comments to me on Christmas eve:Today, after twenty-four hours to recover from the general state of desuetudeand debilitation intowhich I was plunged by four nights in succession of about four hours’ sleep, Ireminisced with great delightof our evening together.With how many memories I was deluged as we sat in that chamber. I have much uponwhich to dwell inthought. 616To which I responded, by now ravished by that elegant 18th-century penmanship:Some years ago my grammar school English teacher observed that only a thoroughlout would typeletters to a friend; they should properly be handwritten in ink. Until recentlyI had succeeded in relegatingthis inconvenient morsel of etiquette to the cobwebbed attic of my brain. Butthe arrival of your carefully-penned letters has lanced deeply into the tattered remains of my conscience. Byway of halfhearted defenseI can say only that, were a grotesquely malformed duck to fall into a pool ofink and subsequently throw afit across a sheet of stationery, you would have a reasonable approximation ofmy longhand.I too found our dialogue in San Francisco thoroughly fascinating. At suchprevious times as we havemet, there always seemed to be either too much excitement or too much formalityfor us to say more than afew words to one another.Of course I am dogged in my opinion that you should reassume what I believe tobe your proper degreein the Hierarchy. To my elemental way of thinking it makes as little sense for aperson to give himself lesscredit than he deserves as to give himself more than he deserves. As anaristocrat, furthermore, would younot agree with me that the existence of exalted titles is of substantialpsychological importance tosubordinates as well as to incumbents?I share with you the conviction that the III° - the Priesthood of Mendes - isthe most crucial distinctionin the Church. My ordination remains to me the single most significant event inmy life. But it also seemedto me that the IV° was not something that could be either consciously pursued orconsciously rejected - thatits confirmation constitutes an express evaluation by the Prince of Darkness ofthe potential andresponsibility of certain Priests and Priestesses. Is it in the High Priest’spower to reject the V° and615 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton & Diane LaVey, December 31, VIII/1973.616 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, December 24, VIII/1973.- 326 -reassume the IV°? I think not - unless, of course, he engages a surgeon toremove a substantial portion ofhis brain!On another matter: I have been giving considerable thought to your method ofdealing with humanintelligence; i.e. either one has it or one doesn’t. On one hand I agree withyou that you can’t trainsomething that is actually a factor of potential into people. Yet I find itequally difficult to identify thispotential in all its devious semblances.Through my interaction with various III° and II° officials of the Church, I hopeto encourage this sparkto mature into a fire wherever it may exist. On more than one occasion I havewasted a good deal of timesearching for a spark where none existed. And on others I have been astonishedby the blaze that resultedfrom my almost carelessly-tossed match.Certainly Satanism equates with an exaltation of individualism. But does it alsoequate withmonasticism? Or does the Satanist not have an implicit responsibility to alertothers to the possibility thatthey may open their eyes if they choose to do so?Inasmuch as Satanism is a religious philosophy for the elite of humanity, itseems highly improbable tome that it could ever become anything resembling a mass movement. If we are tocorrectly exercise ourInfernal Mandate, I think, we must concentrate on introducing ourselves to thosewho may possess that“spark”.Paradoxically, since identification of that spark remains so elusive, we need tomanifest ourselves aswidely as possible. The assumption is that the Elect will then have sufficientinitiative to seek us out in turnand take the first step along the Left-Hand Path. 617In late 1973 an anthology of writings and commentaries on Satanism entitled TheDevil is Alive andWell and Living in America Today was published. It came and went, as did so manysimilarsensationalistic paperbacks on the occult. This one, however, happened toinclude a rare gem: an essay byJohn Ferro, at that time still in semiretirement as a III° but nonethelessreflecting actively on Satanism inhis capacity as a Lecturer in History at the University of San Francisco. Thisessay is reproduced asAppendix #92.617 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John Ferro, January 3, IX/1974.[index-327_1.jpg]- 327 -In the introduction to LaVey’s Satanic Bible, we are told that “many people …would like to knowhow to start Satanic cults and ritualize Black Magic. This book shows them howto go about it and fillsthat need.” What is really being said - and this applies as much to the past asit does to the present - is thatmany people would like to indulge in sexual experiments, try their luck withdrugs, and generally submitthemselves to antisocial activities - and “this book shows them how”.But like all grimoires and bibles of sorcery, the Satanic Bible falsifies basichuman desires by cloakingthem in the vestments of religious cults and magic mumbo-jumbo. It is similarlya method of elevatingbasic lust into the most arrogant “holier than thou” affectation.The medieval sorcerer lusting after power and gold was no better than thecommon, medieval warlordand highwayman with the same ambitions. Similarly the Black Mass priest - andhis “altar” - whoconsider their rituals to be highly elevated and meaningful evocations are, infact, on a par withparticipants of the everyday orgies that take place in brothels, frat housebasements, and suburban livingrooms. Except for their trappings, Satanists and satyrs are brothers under theskin.Owen S. RachleffThe Occult Conceit (1971)* * *Sometimes you feel that LaVey is P.T. Barnum, who said “A sucker is born everyminute”. At othertimes you have the feeling that LaVey is dead serious about his Satanic craft.But what does LaVeybelieve?Listen to his own words: “We hold Satan as a symbolic personal savior, who takescare of mundane,fleshly, carnal things. God exists as a universal force, a balancing factor innature, too impersonal to careone whit whether we live or die … We literally want to give the Devil his due.There has never been areligion before that has given him credit … We believe that man is sometimeslower than the animals, thathe is basically greedy and selfish, so why feel guilty about it? We acceptourselves as we are and live withit.”When LaVey appeared on the Johnny Carson show, he wore a horned hood andbrandished aceremonial sword. He shocked his national audience when he said that his churchaltar was a live andnaked woman to symbolize the pleasures of the flesh. Because the Church of Satanis recognized by theInternal Revenue Service, his income, far in excess of $25,000 a year, comestax-free from his churchmembers.Either LaVey is hopelessly naïve or devilishly vicious. How can you encourageindulgence andvengeance and not expect to reap debauchery and mayhem? Satanism may seem likefun to start with, butit doesn’t stay fun for long. The fact that LaVey’s group has already hadseveral splits indicates that thoseinterested in complete indulgence want more than LaVey can give.William J. PetersonThose Curious New Cults (1973)- 328 -Amid all the “positive” magic, “good” vibrations, and “white” light of the SanFrancisco occult scenestands Anton Szandor LaVey. He stands apart, laughing and stroking his pointedgoatee. His bald headshines in the light from the flames of the black candles at his “black” magicceremonies. He wears blackrobes and a priest’s white collar. He is the self-styled “Black Pope” of theoccult nether world. Some talkof him with awe and great respect. Others never mention his name, referring tohim quickly as “that man”.Whether LaVey is putting on an act or not is a debatable question. His years asa carnival magiciangive him great theatrical flair, yet he seems convinced that his mission onEarth is to be the Devil’s HighPriest. His church “answers a need in this Godless society” and also brings hima good income.He is not concerned with scoffers, for “the victim of a hex or curse is muchmore prone to destructionif he does not believe in it! So long as man knows the meaning of fear, he willneed the ways and meansto defend himself against these fears. If religious faith and fervor can makebleeding wounds appear on thebody in approximation to the wounds supposedly inflicted on Christ, why thenshould there be any doubtas to the destructive extremes of fear and terror? Therefore never attempt toconvince the skeptic uponwhom you wish to place a curse. Allow him to scoff. To enlighten him wouldlessen your chance ofsuccess. Listen with benign assurance as he laughs at your magic, knowing hisdays are filled with turmoilall the while. If he is despicable enough, by Satan’s grace, he might even die -laughing!”David St. ClairPsychic World of California (1973)* * *“Would you like to see more of the house?” LaVey asked politely. “Yes,” saidMary Lou eagerly. Ihesitated until his steely eyes fastened on me. I quickly stammered, “Sure … yes… sure.” He led us downa narrow hall into another room, dominated by a glass case. I was no longerstartled to see it housed askeleton.“Lovely, don’t you think? Notice the massive eruptions on the bones, theabnormally extended ribcage, the toes as long as most people’s fingers.”“Is it human?” Mary Lou asked. “In life,” continued LaVey, “this personresembled a monster.” Iedged toward the door, flexing my own fingers and wishing we were in northernSiberia.“What are you doing?” Mary Lou asked. I followed her gaze to the fireplace. Isaw LaVey tug at themantel, and to my horrified astonishment the entire section of wall swungoutward, revealing a cavern andshadowy stonework. “There’s a secret passage in every room in the house,” hesaid, closing the space.As he talked, he slowly rubbed the skull hanging on a chain round his neck. “Howabout anotherliqueur?” he asked.Pat MontandonThe Intruders (1975)[index-329_1.jpg]- 329 -Many years later it is difficult to recapture the atmosphere created by TheExorcist. Since its firstappearance in May 1971, William Peter Blatty’s novel of dæmonic possession hadgone through 13hardcover and 20 paperback printings by the time the movie version was releasedat the beginning of1974. The movie quickly became famous for two things: (a) long lines of peoplewaiting outside theatersin order to see it, and (b) many viewers being severely frightened by it.Since The Exorcist was the most lavish Satanic film since Rosemary’s Baby, andsince the Church ofSatan had been soaring high on publicity for the last several years, one wouldthink that they would havebeen natural allies in the public eye. Oddly enough, this was not at all thecase.Unlike Rosemary’s Baby, which had “modernized” Satanism, The Exorcist portrayedthe Devil and thePowers of Darkness as something straight out of medieval superstition. Theresult was a caricature ofpossession so literal, and so crude, that it was embarrassing to both Catholicsand Satanists alike.Even though the film appeared to demonstrate the power and the authenticity ofCatholicism, it did soby hyping one of the lingering superstitions with which modern Catholicism isnot particularlycomfortable. The churches found themselves swamped with new devotees - but forthe wrong reason.They feared, and rightly so, that once the novelty of “possession” wore off,they would look all the moreridiculous for having tried to capitalize on momentary hysteria.The less-principled conventional churches, of course, did exactly that. Radioand television talk showsvied with the National Enquirer for the most deliciously lurid account ofpossession, preferably by a manof the cloth. After the better part of a year, the public began to loseinterest, but the echoes still have notcompletely faded out.On its side of the fence, the Church of Satan was also somewhat less thancomfortable with TheExorcist. Yes, it portrayed Satan as real and powerful, but again it representedSatanism in a primitive,medieval fashion. And in keeping with this medieval literalism, it showed thePowers of Darkness asbeing inferior to and fearful of the crude, fetishistic rituals of exorcismpracticed by the Jesuit priests. LikeCatholicism, the Church of Satan was confronted by a social sensation whichbrought it further into thelimelight, but not in the most comfortable way.Then there was the cardinal sin: Neither the Church nor its High Priest had beenconsulted for thenovel or film, or had known anything at all about them prior to release. TheChurch of Satan had beenconsidered irrelevant and unnecessary to the writing and filming of a majorstatement on Satanism. Thetouch of irritation this caused at 6114 California Street, which attempted togloss over its noninvolvement,is evident in the bulletin sent out to Priests and Regional Agents in February1974 (Appendix #93).My attitude towards standing in lines is somewhat similar to John Ferro’sconcerning typewriters andautomobiles. After The Exorcist had been around for a month, I finallycondescended to join an around-the-block line at the Westwood Theater in Los Angeles. The line turned out to bemore entertaining thanthe movie, as there was a regular stream of sidewalk vendors and entertainersmoving along its length.Impromptu friendships were formed and condensed life-stories told. As word gotround the line that I- 330 -seemed to “know something” about diabolism, I found myself buttonholed forfive-minute dissertations onpossession and exorcism. It was almost a shame to see, after two hours or so,the box office!In New York the Lilith Grotto had had a comparable experience. Stuart Levine hadstood for fourhours in the rain in order to buy tickets, and then the entire Grotto - dressedto the teeth in red and black -had assembled to go to the theater, no doubt terrorizing the already jumpyaudience.“You might get a bang out of The Exorcist,” Michael Grumboski wrote. “MissZalewski and I went toview it the day it opened in Detroit. Great fun to watch the weak-hearted orweak-stomached run from thetheater. The special effects were worth the admission price.” 618In late January, after thinking about the entire phenomenon some more, I decidedto issue a fact sheetof my own to the Priesthood and the Regional Agents (Appendix #94), followed bya lead article in theJanuary-February Cloven Hoof (Appendix #95). Among the first reactions was onefrom Robert DeCeccoin Massachusetts:Your letter to the L.A. Times was brilliant! I have done as you suggested andsent a similar letter, usingsome of your ideas only, to the Editor of the South Middlesex News.I have sent varied letters and opinions on subjects relevant to Satanism to thisnewspaper in the past, asrebuttals to editorials with religious intent. As a result of the typical,provincial New England nature,however, these letters were most likely swept under the rug of theircondemnation, as they were neverpublished in the paper’s “Opinion” section. More proof of their fear of us! Iguess that church fairs and BoyScouts keep them pretty busy.I cannot express enough how a report such as yours helps in our dealings withthe public. I lookforward to more of them if you find the time. 619From Canada came some interesting feedback from Stephen Hollander:I have read your mailing on exorcism with interest. For some reason we have beenspared the rash ofpublicity which heralded the appearance of The Exorcist in the United States.This, combined with thegenerally different attitude which the average Canadian has towards mattersreligious, has resulted, so far asI have been able to determine, in the reaction to the movie being a sustainedyawn.In Ottawa we had an article off the A.P. wire which was buried on page #14, andthis article was of sucha nature that I strongly suspect one of our followers may have had a hand in it.In the Toronto papers Ihaven’t seen even that much.I suppose that, to a large extent, the different attitude which I mentionedabove is due to a combinationof such factors as the British tradition, the religious compromises with theFrench which were necessaryafter the British victory in the wars with the French, and our traditional viewof our country as a mosaicrather than a melting-pot.Canadians, at least insofar as religious matters are concerned, seem to be lessprone to demagoguery ofwhatever persuasion. Billy Graham, for one, generally keeps clear of us on hisworld tours. I can see whyThe Exorcist might make considerably different impressions in our two countries.I have not yet seen the movie, although I suppose that I shall. I have read thebook, and I can see how arather poor movie could be made from it. I find it significant, as did you, thatthe author made his“possessee” a young girl in spite of the fact that, in the “actual” case, it wasa boy. All of the novels which Ihave read on this subject deal with young girls. This, combined with the historyof the Inquisition, isinstructive; and the pathology is obvious. 620618 Letter. Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, January 21, IX/1974.619 Letter, Robert DeCecco to M.A. Aquino, January 25, IX/1974.620 Letter, Stephen Hollander to M.A. Aquino, January 28, IX/1974.- 331 -John Ferro, who had been a Roman Catholic prior to his affiliation with theChurch of Satan, had in acurious way never cut his ties with Catholicism despite his Priesthood andMagistry under the ægis of its“Great Enemy”. In The Devil’s Avenger this was recounted somewhat negatively, asif to say that Ferro toohad his secret psychological weaknesses. Whatever “weaknesses” John had, it isfair to say that hisinterest in Catholicism is not among them. He admired the strength, artisticimagery, and grandeur of thechurch; he rejected its affront to his historical and philosophicalsensibilities. Now he wrote to me:As you probably know, I feel no antagonism towards the institutional Christianchurch - quite thecontrary in the case of Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism, which have greatlyenriched my life. Yet Ithink your criticisms quite deserved, and very neatly lodged in the vulnerablequarters.Some of the points, most especially the repression, suppression, and personalityconflicts as generatorsof antisocial, violent, and obscene behavior, I discussed in an interview I didfor C.B.C. last Monday.Quite frankly I enjoyed the movie as a horror shocker, and relish theprovocative discussion which hasensued. Of course, as usual, the idiots and the intellectual obscenities, thoughthey occasionally affordcomic relief, do diminish the pleasure of it all. 621In addition to the television interview, Ferro had also written a letter inresponse to the San FranciscoChronicle’s “exorcism” article, invoking not his Church of Satan office butrather his scholarly credentialsas a Ph.D. His letter was duly published, and he sent me a copy:The recent furor over The Exorcist and exorcism, while not unexpected, isnonetheless somewhatludicrous and not a little bizarre. The movie, though hardly distinguished, isvery good and provocative. Itshould cause people to seriously consider the phenomenon of dæmonic possession.However, if recentissues appearing in the press are any indication, it would appear that itsprincipal effect has been to fortify agood deal of neurotic exhibitionism and to foster an entirely unfounded optimismon the part of a number ofthe clergy.As a historian, having devoted some years of study to historical manifestationsrelating to witchcraft,Satanism, and the dæmonic, I think that the most basic issue is being obscured,as usual, by the idiot fringe.The real question, yet unsolved, possibly insoluble, is that of the verypossibility of dæmonicpossession. It is significant that the majority of recorded examples of suchphenomena, including thefamous nuns of Loudon and the factual case upon which the novel and movie inquestion were based,involve perverse sexual acts, obscene language, violence to oneself and others,and abuse of reveredobjects, religious or otherwise.That cases exist which are not, even now, susceptible to all the advancedtechniques of medicine andpsychiatry is undeniable. However it would behoove us to consider whether suchmanifestations are morelikely the result of personified, possessing dæmons, or the destructive dæmonsof repression andsuppression imposed by a dishonest and hypocritical society. Are actions such asthose of the young girl inThe Exorcist the result of the minions of the Devil, or are they the finalobscenity of a society that, for all itsmaterialism, hates matter? 622Margaret Wendall, who had been interviewed on the subject of exorcism by the SanJose press(Appendix #96), had some interesting news to pass along on the subject of FatherKarl Patzelt,Catholicism’s renegade exorcist in San Francisco:This whole incident has a special meaning to me, because I know Fr. Patzelt. Inmy search for truth,and as a student of the Russian language at San Jose State, I contacted Fr.Patzelt, attended some of hisservices, and discussed religion with him. I never thought he was a mentalgiant, but it did surprise mesomewhat that he would take part in an exorcism. Perhaps we both have greatlychanged in the time since621 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, January 28, IX/1974.622 Letter, John Ferro to the San Francisco Chronicle, January IX/1974.- 332 -our talks. It certainly seems so! Nevertheless I first learned of theexorcism(s) from Fr. Patzelt’s Christmasbulletin, which I received in December a good month before it hit the frontpages. This is what it saysconcerning the series of exorcisms:“In July the prioress of a local Carmelite monastery asked me to help a youngfamily in a suburb of SanFrancisco. They were suffering from attacks of the Devil, she said. It didn’ttake long to establish the factsconfirming the words of the prioress; they had already suffered in 1972 for tenweeks. Now it started inMay. Since then they could sleep only two hours each night, from 4 to 6 AM,because of the disturbancescaused by the evil one, e.g. throwing around their shoes, breaking windows,putting towels on fire, hittingthem, and thousands of other dirty tricks.“With the permission of the Archbishop of San Francisco, I performed the firstsolemn exorcism onAugust 19, with the result that the nights were quiet from then on. There werefourteen such services; thelast one, on September 18, set them free.“Two things were marvelous to observe: How mightily the faith of everyone whoattended one of theseexorcism services was invigorated when they saw with their own eyes the Devil atwork and the power ofGod, and how beautifully people all over the states responded with their prayersand sacrifices, as amanifestation of true Christian charity, when the call to help this young familyin distress reached them.”I suspect that there will be a letter to the editor of the Mercury suggestingthat Fr. Patzelt come toBubastis Chapel to exorcise the dæmons here. I have no intention of letting himin my front door, althoughit might be fun to let him make a fool of himself again. 623From the midwest Tom Huddleston sent a summary of Ohio’s reaction to “LanaGreen”:Enclosed is an article (Appendix #97) which appeared in the February 24 editionof the Dayton dailynewspaper. Unfortunately I (as “William Ashton”) was not able to meet with thereporter in person and hadto deliver my comments over the phone.As you can see, the resulting article is a bit misleading in places due to theslight rearranging of mycomments by the reporter. The article, however, prompted a phone call andfinally a filmed news interviewby Dayton’s channel 2 television station.The news reporter, Mr. Howard Ain, and his cameraman had a field day filming theSatanicembellishments of my apartment. They were most cooperative in choosing moreappropriate comments -such as a reading of the Nine Satanic Statements - for their news spot thatevening. In the filmed interview Iwas able to clear up the questionable areas of the newspaper article. As a finaltouch I loaned the reporterssome good background music to add to the newscast: the “Hymn to Satan” and organworks by Liszt.Since the television broadcast I have been up to my horns in letters inquiringabout the Church of Satan.As for The Exorcist, Dayton’s interest in the movie lasted for about a week.Currently in its third week here,it is attended mostly by thrill seekers under 18; and even they find it hard toswallow.624The Church of Satan’s final statement on The Exorcist came in the form of aninterview with AntonLaVey for a special “exorcism edition” of the tabloid National Tattler appearingin the early spring of1974, when the initial furor over the film had begun to exhaust itself. Anton’scool and analyticalcomments (Appendix #98) were in sharp contrast to those of the other occultistsand clergy whosehysterical and sensationalistic ravings filled the paper.Thus The Exorcist came and went. Ultimately it did not do anything either for oragainst the fortunesof the Church of Satan, save to accord the Church a momentary opportunity for astatement or two. Todaythe “Hitchcock steps” in Georgetown, down which Lee J. Cobb ran to discover themangled corpse of oneof Regan’s victims at the bottom, are once more neglected and covered with thechewing gum wrappersand beer cans of passing Georgetown University students.623 Letter, Margaret Wendall to M.A. Aquino, January 29, IX/1974.624 Letter, Thomas Huddleston to “Lana Green”, March 4, IX/1974.[index-333_1.jpg]- 333 -Perhaps the filming of The Exorcist in Georgetown did unleash some dæmonicforces in the District ofColumbia. 1973-1974 was the era of the Watergate scandal, which had come to thepublic eye as the resultof a break-in at the Watergate, a lavish complex of apartments on the Potomaconly a few blocks awayfrom the “Hitchcock steps”.As The Exorcist was terrifying crowds around the country in February of 1974,John Mitchell (formerAttorney General) and Maurice Stans (former Secretary of Commerce) were beingtried for perjury andobstruction of justice. By March 1 a Washington grand jury had indicted seventop Nixon aides - includingHaldeman, Erlichman, Colson, and Mitchell - in the Watergate cover-up. The sameGrand Jury also namedPresident Richard Nixon as an unindicted coconspirator. The House ofRepresentatives’ JudiciaryCommittee had begun an investigation into possible impeachment of Nixon himself.The next five months,culminating in Nixon’s resignation from the Presidency on August 9, were to be atime of unusual politicaltension in the nation; one might well call it a “witch-hunt”, since a popularatmosphere of almost morbidpleasure accompanied each successive legal victory against the White House.In such an atmosphere it is understandable that the Church of Satan was itselfmore interested inpolitical developments than usual. One of its more amusing bouts began with theappearance of a minornews item a few days before Christmas 1973:A Day of Humiliation is Urged by SenateWASHINGTON, December 20, 1973 (UPI) - The Senate adopted a resolution todaycalling for theobservance next April 30 of a “national day of humiliation, fasting, andprayer”. The resolution wasintroduced by Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, and adopted byvoice vote and with nodebate or opposition. It declares that, because of the nation’s failings, “itbehooves us to humble ourselvesbefore Almighty God, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency andforgiveness”. 625The coincidence was too amusing to be ignored. While I had nothing againstHatfield - he and I wereold college fraternity brothers - I could not resist tweaking his tail:Dear Senator Hatfield:I cannot help wondering whether you appreciate the significance of the date youhave selected for theobservance.April 30th is also known by the name Walpurgisnacht. Since Classical times ithas been heralded as thegreatest Sabbat of the entire year, surpassing even the more widely knownHalloween in this regard. OnWalpurgisnacht the Powers of Darkness have traditionally held sway across theentire Earth, returning toHell at cockcrow on the first of May. Moussorgsky’s famous composition “A Nighton Bald Mountain” waswritten, for example, to commemorate a Walpurgis festival in pre-OrthodoxRussia.625 United Press International, Washington, D.C., December 20, 1973.- 334 -So I trust you will forgive us if we derive a bit of amusement out of thenation’s humbling itself on thisparticular date. The Devil will no doubt accept the gesture with a smile at theinnocent irony of it all.Michael A. AquinoMagister Templi IV°Church of Satan626I received no immediate answer, and in fact I hardly expected any answer at all,since correspondencewith the infamous Church of Satan could hardly help a United States Senator’simage. I forgot all aboutthe exchange until, to my surprise, the following personal letter, complete withthe Church of Satan’saddress and my personal title therein, arrived in my mail eight months later:Dear Magister Aquino:I appreciated your communication concerning the National Day of Humiliation,Fasting, and Prayer. Iregret that because of the great volume of mail, I was not able to answer beforenow. On April 30th Iparticipated in a moving service at the National Presbyterian Church here inWashington. Because of yourinterest, I am enclosing a copy of various parts of the service for your review.Kindest regards,Mark O. HatfieldUnited States Senator627I might add that the part of the service which he enclosed was a prose-poem -also read into theCongressional Record by Hatfield - which is hardly complimentary toChristianity:Listen, Christian - by Bob RolandI was hungry, and you formed a humanities club and discussed my hunger. Thankyou. I wasimprisoned, and you crept off quietly to your chapel in the cellar and prayedfor my release. I was naked,and in your mind you debated the morality of my appearance. I was sick, and youknelt and thanked Godfor your health. I was homeless, and you preached to me about the spiritualshelter of the love of God. I waslonely, and you left me alone to pray for me. Christian, you seem so holy, soclose to God. But I’m still veryhungry, and lonely, and cold…Did the United States Senate’s tribute to Satan on Walpurgis cause the releaseof the transcripts of thePresidential tapes by the White House that same day? Who knows what namelessrites are practiced onCapitol Hill?As Richard Nixon’s favor with the public declined, Satan gained in credibility.It is difficult to saywhether the President or The Exorcist contributed more to this. In the ClovenHoof I observed:The President may not be doing so hot in the polls, but the Devil is. Asoon-to-be-published survey of3,546 persons by the Center for Policy Research reveals that the Devil’sexistence is now endorsed by 48%of those interviewed [as opposed to 37% in I A.S. (1966)]. At the same time,belief in God’s existencedropped from 77% to 69%. According to Dr. Clyde Z. Nunn, the Center’s SeniorResearch Associate, theshifting focus on the Devil implies that, in the contest between Good and Evil,the balance has “tipped inthe direction of Evil”. Couldn’t have put it better ourselves!628Although President Nixon was an avid, even fundamentalist Christian and hadhardly done any favorsfor Satanism, there was no reason for the Church of Satan to take pleasure inhis sufferings. Our bemused626 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Senator Mark Hatfield, January 4, IX/1974.627 Letter, Senator Mark Hatfield to M.A. Aquino, September 10, 1974.628 Aquino, M.A., “Hoofbeats”, Cloven Hoof #VI-3, May/June IX/1974.- 335 -observations of Watergate, in fact, gradually turned to contempt as we watchedthe vultures circle thewounded President, waiting for him to “die”. In the Hoof I wrote:The Church of Satan’s Patzelt Award for distinguished service to Christianpublic relations is herebyconferred upon President Nixon’s Jesuit sidekick, Father John McLaughlin. In arecent press conference hedeclaimed: “The released transcripts [of the Presidential Watergate tapes] don’tshow any immoral behavior,and those who say they do are guilty of hypocrisy!” As a matter of fact heprobably has a point about thehypocrisy, but that’s our line, not Christianity’s!629In the next issue, printed only a few days before Nixon’s resignation, Iventured an even more bluntand scornful observation:Encore Rats Deserting Sinking Ship: Never was there such a Presidential patronof organizedChristianity as Richard Nixon. But now that he’s in need of even a little moralsupport from them, theBible-jocks have suddenly remembered pressing engagements elsewhere. Mostprominent turncoats areNorman Vincent Peale and - wouldn’t you know it - the Graham Quacker.Nixon’s Key Biscayne pastor, Reverend John Huffman, has also denounced him andcalled upon him to“repent publicly and accept the forgiveness of Jesus Christ”. No fewer than 26separate Quaker groups havejoined the chorus. McLaughlin, recipient of the Hoof’s coveted Patzelt Awardlast issue for his defense ofthe Watergate tapes, subsequently received a severe box on the ears by hisJesuit superiors for his pains.Perhaps they heard about the award?This time it goes hands down to Senator Harold Hughes, who recently quoth: “Godcan and will useWatergate as a rebirth of this nation.” 630After Richard Nixon’s August resignation, the nation’s attention turned towardsits economic plight,which, because of the inability of the besieged Nixon Administration to concernitself with anythingexcept Watergate, was approaching the catastrophic. For the September/OctoberCloven Hoof I decided toprepare a lead article commenting on this bewildering situation (Appendix #99).As I was drafting the rest of the issue, Diane LaVey telephoned and asked me toinclude favorablemention of a book called Teddy Bare. I finally tracked it down in SantaBarbara’s “American Opinion”bookstore and found it to be an attack on Senator Edward Kennedy, who at thistime was once more beingtalked about as a possible Democratic candidate for the Presidency. Diane alsoasked that I delete aplanned favorable review of The Legend of Bruce Lee, which I had considered oneof the more insightfulbiographies of that colorful martial artist. After pondering the requests, Isent my reasons northward:Teddy Bare’s publisher is a Birch Society affiliate. That’s the outfit, you’llremember, that thinks yourcarpets are dirty, your house smells of mildew, and your husband has weak eyesand a limp, clammyhandshake. You’d have to skin me alive to give them a promo in the Hoof.Your principle is well-taken - that timely release of a key book can movemountains - but I think it’sbetter illustrated by the Satanic Bible. The anti-Church of Satan reprint fromAmerican Opinion is still inprint and available in Birchite bookstores, by the way - right alongside TeddyBare and similar material.Just like you, I thought that the Bruce Lee book was merely one more Kung-F ucult item when Iglanced at it in the store. But then I read it and changed my mind. This fellowcomes close to being anAnton Szandor LaVey of the orient. Broke all the rules, told critics that ifthey didn’t like it, it was justtough, and was loved for it. Was fiercely hated by all conventional schools andtraditions of Karate, Kung-629 Ibid.630 Aquino, M.A., “Hoofbeats”, Cloven Hoof #VI-4, July/August IX/1974.- 336 -Fu, etc. Designed his own system from scratch. Strong possibility that his deathwas contrived by peoplewho didn’t like boats rocked. Get the book and you’ll see what I’m driving at.631Diane’s response provided interesting insight into Anton’s attitude towardsofficial expressions by theChurch of Satan:Here we go again! Before I get into the detailed run-down on the Hoof, I’d liketo explain something toyou about Anton’s modus operandi when it comes to writing - his as well as otherpeople’s.When Anton writes something, he is usually quite flexible when it’s given thefirst edit, by either me ora publishing house editor. I would estimate that he will accept fifty toseventy-five percent of the copyediting done on his stuff, but he holds firm on the rest. I think this isbecause, having had to give hisenergies to the entire piece, he realizes that certain points detrimental to thewhole are bound to crop upwhen read by someone else whose brain is not as tightly wrapped around theinitial idea or inspiration.On the other hand, when he reads someone else’s book or article, he first triesto grasp the main point -whether it’s successfully made and whether it’s valid to begin with. This, ofcourse, is what we all do. Butthen he speculates on the implications of specific references or analogies: whateffect they will have onvarious types of readers, and what the author would like in the way ofpositive/negative responses - andfrom which sources respectively.In other words, it isn’t so much whether he likes the piece or agrees with it,but whether the author orpublication is going to receive the most beneficial response. He looks at itfrom all angles; and once he’smade his evaluation, he’s not likely to change his mind.It would appear, then, that he gives greater thought to something someone elsewrites than he does tohis own. But this is only partially true, since he does the same supercriticalevaluation of his own writing ifit’s something he’s had the time to let sit for awhile and then to return towhen his energies and emotionsare not so tightly tied into the main thrust of the article or book.If you’re still with me, I think you will understand how this M.O. of his comesto bear upon a hybridproject like the Hoof. Normally he would encourage you to write for the maximumpositive feedback toyour way of thinking. This would hold true in most cases. I emphasize “most”because there are exceptions,when your Church-related correspondence or articles are, for all intents andpurposes, representing him -his viewpoint, personality, motivations, and/or organization. You’ve seenoccasional examples of theexceptions I’m talking about in his reactions to correspondence you’ve sent topublic personalities, and itcertainly holds true with the Hoof.It is true that most of the actual membership know that you are the Editor andthe author of the ideasexpressed in the Hoof. When it comes to far-reaching implications, though, it is- as you’ve pointed outmany times - his football. I want to emphasize the positive end of thisarrangement, which he fullyrecognizes as well, and this is that your bright ideas reflect positively uponhim and his organization. If hedidn’t feel that your different points of view and manner of dealing with thingsare a good balance to hisown, you wouldn’t be in the position you are.So, to boil all this down, the times he gets adamant about what he does anddoesn’t want said are thosewhen it represents him at least as much as you.For this issue he approved “money, etc.” and the deletion of Teddy Bare. Heunderstands your reasoning[I told him I wholeheartedly agreed] and appreciates the expression of youraffection and loyalty to him.Sometimes Anton does things for the pure perversity of it; he quite enjoys doingexactly the opposite ofwhat people expect of him! And in this case, though he didn’t say so, I expecthe thought it might be fun tomake the Birchites squirm a bit [or maybe get them quarreling amongst themselvesover “this LaVeycharacter”, a la Martello/Bonewits] by giving one of them a plug.I know he is aware of the stupid “red menace” crap in the book, because hecommented to me: “Justwhen one of these guys might get some intelligent people heeding what he has tosay, he throws a brickwall up in their minds against anything valid he might offer when he startsraving about the ‘pinkos’.”631 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, October 7, IX/1974.- 337 -This is not just a rambling aside, but is intended to give you further insightinto the nature of the beast.It also leads me to the point that, while you - and I - often don’t follow hisreasoning on a particular matter,it is rarely stubbornness or whim on his part. Instead it is backed up by rathercomplex intellectual strategy.At least I’m never bored!Now to the no-no’s. Delete “R. Reagan?” after “Cromwell”. Whether thiscomparison is interpreted aspositive or negative, Reagan isn’t a strong enough figure. On the positive sidehis balms aren’t soothingenough, and on the negative end his waves aren’t big enough. He’s just anotherandroid.Re the Sheik al-Yamani example, the Satanic overview to which Anton wasreferring [and about whichI made the notation] is that villains are created when the need arises. In thiscase the Sheik’s shekelsproblem could have been intentionally gauged to force him to take the Villain(Joker/Harlequin) card.The other point to consider is that, like it or not, the Jews still control thepublic media for the most partin this country. [Roger Price, incidentally, falls into that category.] Soeither use a more“tactful” (pragmatic) example, or at least delete the final sentence (“If youwere Sheik …”). Besides all this,when you come right down to it, it’s really people’s kinky “persuasions” thatcontrol politics, economy, andeverything else.Delete the Pyramid Power and Legend of Bruce Lee reviews. After Anton’s articlelast issue, anyfurther discussion of pyramids seems ludicrous. Pyramid power is still a fad, soin view of what he said, ourreviewing even a good book on the subject is just sheepherding. It’s like aparent figuring that even thoughhe doesn’t want his kid to smoke and has voiced his objections, the kid’s goingto do it anyway - so hemight as well buy him a carton of “low tar/low nicotine” cigarettes.Anton knows from reliable sources that the entire Bruce Lee legend was a PRinvention, of which thebook is part. Lee was a ghetto kid from the orient who knew some fancy footwork,and the legend-makerstook him in tow and did what they do best. Now if the book were written asfiction, we could all be inspiredby his “critics-be-damned” attitude, just as we are by any convincingly writtenstory about superpeople. 632Anton’s position - that anything written is only as good as the effect that itproduces in the “target”readership - has much to commend it. It argues for writing as a means to an end,a vehicle by which adesired “real” goal may be approached or attained.The counter-argument - which I did not think to raise at the time - is thatthere is a certain dignity totruth whether or not it is recognized or appreciated as such. This is thecentral premise of philosophy, butin the Church of Satan philosophical purity played a definite second fiddle topragmatism - not that theChurch had no regard for truth, but rather that it placed a higher premium oninfluencing the behavior of ahumanity whose ability to recognize or respond to truth it denied.The LaVeys’ instructions to delete mention of Ronald Reagan as a possible“American OliverCromwell”, as well as the passing observation concerning his future consequence,are of course mildlyfunny considering that, during the 1980s, he sat in the White House andorchestrated about asCromwellian an administration as this country can endure. In 1980, afterReagan’s election, Anton wrote:Personally I have a good feeling about Reagan - something I could never get withCarter. All politiciansare actors. Maybe there’s something slightly more honest about one who has doneit professionally … Ormaybe I’m just evaluating an almost lost quality that occasionally creeps to thesurface. It’s calledintelligence.633While I could take or leave a compliment (?) to Ronald Reagan, I was somewhatmore disturbed byDiane’s prohibition of anything even potentially offensive to Jews. Sheikal-Yamani, Oil Minister of SaudiArabia, was troublesome to a great many more people than Jews, and to a greatmany nations besidesIsrael. At the same time his dashingly good looks and urbane, cultured mannermade him a difficult man to632 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 9, IX/1974.633 LaVey, Anton, “Sneaking Up”, Cloven Hoo f #XII-6, November-December XV/1980.- 338 -hate. To me he was an excellent example of what a skilled Lesser Magician cando, and I hadn’t given athought to the religious-lobby angle.As a Satanist I had long been accustomed to tolerating no sacred cows, and thesudden imposition ofone on me from 6114 California Street was startling and irritating. Was thispolicy from the same manwhose Satanic Bible had included:I gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah and pluck him by the beard;I uplift a broad-axeand split open his worm-eaten skull!634If the Church of Satan were not free to criticize all hypocrisy, falsehood, andcorruption - if we couldtarget, say, only Christianity - then we could not pretend to be motivated bythe unblemished search fortruth. Rather we would be a mere faction presenting a propagandistic facade tocompeting and opposingfactions - in this case an ally of Judaism or even Zionism against the WesternChristian tradition.Of course I did not draw such “deep” conclusions from Diane’s 1974 letter; Imerely felt a mildannoyance at being warned off a group that I had not even consciouslycriticized. And, on the face of it,Diane’s stated reason - that the Church of Satan needed media toleration andapproval - seemed sensibleenough. Yet now, as I reflect back on it, I see in that prohibition adiscernible move away from authenticityand towards the preoccupation with surface imagery that would lead to the crisisof 1975.Since I/1966 the Church of Satan had never been a particularlypolitically-conscious institution.Satanists tended to be individuals who avoided political involvement, eitherbecause they werediscouraged by its demands and competitiveness or because they held itshypocritical maneuvering in thesame sort of contempt they directed towards conventional religion. The Watergateand economic events ofVIII/1973-IX/1974 raised Satanic political consciousness only momentarily;thereafter the Churchreturned to its previous indifference.An interesting example of the potential of Satanism in the political sphere isthe following letterwritten by Priest Paul Pipkin to me:Being of a political bent, I’ve long been interested in the matter ofsynchronicity, as I’ve seen so oftenhow “meaningful coincidence” intervenes to determine the exact form in which thedictates of economiclaw are played out in history. There, I suspect, lies the true area of Satanicinterest in the political arena,with the conspiratorial factor only secondary. I have no unified theory topresent, but I don’t find thatparticularly discouraging since the combined efforts of Jung and Pawli failed tosupply one for even simplesynchronistic events, whereas the complex confluences of politics would almostrequire a computer.A few days ago I sent to Central some thoughts I had while trying to extractprinciples from somepersonal experience of my own. In the process I digressed into an area which,upon reflection, I thoughtmight be of particular interest to yourself - knowing of your interest ineconomic and political development.Many of these notions are quite unsurprising, coming from one such as myself,given my background onthe liberal-left fringe and “programmed to manipulate and destruct”, as Diane[Pipkin] puts it. Still I stressthat I’ve recently encountered strong objective evidence that my predilectionshold water.There can be little doubt that the nation and the Western world, possibly theother blocs as well, are indeep economic trouble. I can see that the hierarchy fully appreciates this factand the chaotic social andpolitical conditions which will ensue. Clearly the cellularized Fourth Phase andthe low profile are contrivedat least in part to guarantee the Church’s posture through such a period. Italso affords the whole Church, aswell as the hierarchy, maximum versatility in that the isolated units canencompass a multitude ofundertakings which might seem contradictory if carried on by individuals andfactions in a unified group.History indicates that the traditional reaction of the American people to badtimes involves a religiousreaction of some form. This charade has been played out over and over, and eventhe new fully-urbanizedmajority is not so far from its traditional roots that we can’t anticipatesomething of the same psychologicalcontent again. Indeed the evidence surrounds us already.634 LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Bible, page #30.- 339 -I appreciate the fact that the Church of Satan has been interested in providing“fuel for evangelists’hellfires” while giving no evident support to their usual opponents. Hopefully,in the backlash to come,there will be more than enough militant atheists, humanists, free-lovers, pornofans, occult faddists, etc. todraw their fire. However I think that we should be prepared, as the Christianenthusiasm grows, to takecontrol of the minds and behavior of the diehard anti-Christians, who at thattime will occupy the adversaryposition once more.In general this will doubtless be accomplished passively, through thedistribution of the forthcomingbooks and by maintaining our noble posture. But I’ve been exploring anopportunity to do somewhat moreon a purely tactical level. I’d like to call your attention to my own area ofpolitical interest. If we assume fora moment that the old model of the political spectrum holds up, solely forillustration’s sake, I wouldidentify that area in and around the line where the purely “liberal” approachextends itself into what isgenerally known as “left” - and not too far to either the right or the left ofthat area. As I’ve had someexperience all across the board, both the mainstream and the other fringes, Iunderstand how limited thisconcept is, yet I do declare that the segment I speak of contains some unusuallydynamic and imaginativeindividuals.Indeed the recent works on the international remnants of the SS provide “lessonsto be learned” for amovement such as ours, perhaps one of the most important being how to succeed orfail at survival withoutthe backing of state machinery or a particular national identity. But thereal-world cousins of Fleming’sSPECTRE are to be found in other areas as well. With your interest in Lenin, youunderstand, I’m sure, themetamorphoses undergone by revolutionary socialism since his time. Against thebackground of the socialdemocracy of the last century [which invariably became loyal opposition in theirnative countries and gaverise to Western socialist parties of today], Lenin formulated the concept of avanguard party ofrevolutionary intellectuals. This concept, in many respects an elitist one [asmany lesser-known writings ofLenin prove], failed to stand the test of state power in Russia. Stalinconverted the vanguard Communistparties of Europe into virtual adjuncts of Soviet foreign policy. Likewise themass parties of workers whichWestern communists aim for today do not resemble the semi-elitist vanguard partyof Lenin.Now there does exist an element that pays principled allegiance to the Leninistformula, to be found inthe organizations of international Trotskyism. Their ideas are not to be takenseriously in the context of late20th-century economics, nor are they organizationally stable. In fact they splitlike amœbæ and proliferatelike rabbits. But this is the very reason I bring them up as a suitable subjectfor scrutiny by Satanists. Herewe have a semi-elitist, international movement which in its publications (inthis country the Militant,Spartacist, and Workers’ World) has the peculiarity of droning on at length andin detail about the reasonsfor its factional difficulties. Usually the formula runs such that a particularTrotskyist party off in Paraguayor somewhere achieves some success and then founds a “tendency” insisting thatthe entire worldmovement adopt its particular approach.You see the analogy at this point. During our Fourth Phase we would hope thatsome clergy and Grottoshit pure gold in their own individual applications of Satanism. Yet there maydevelop tendencies to regardthese successes as more than they are, and to confuse them with the overalldirection of the philosophy,forgetting that the Master Plan cannot be completely appreciated with only onepart in view. I made thissmall digression into the politics of the ultra-left to illustrate thispotential concern of the Order in futurestages, and to illustrate that lessons are to be found in that end of thepolitical arena as well.To return to the main theme: I have very solid reason to believe one aspect ofthe coming upheaval willbe a reformation of some of the early cadres of the old civil rights and studentmovements. I discussed someof this in my paper to Central. If you are interested in all this, you might geta Xerox from them. What it allboils down to is this: There seems to be a tendency among a limited group ofmiddle-class persons, aboutage 30 now, with a history of political activism and leadership capacity, toseek out their old confederateswith an eye towards opportunity in the coming depressive conditions.I must point out that there is no certainty about their political directions.These “early cadre” (1960-64)were what the Marxists would call “petit-bourgeois”, i.e. vacillating. Theywere, as students, about evenlydivided between democratic socialist and right-wing libertarian directions, afew “liberals” as well. As Isaid to you in August, it’s hard to develop an overall view of anything fromTexas, but in this part of thecountry I’m aware that this element has a natural inclination against not onlypolitical liberalism but againstthe Christian churches as well, particularly the progressive Christianorganizations. I am 80% positive that- 340 -this bunch of political bandits are going to get together again for another grabat the goodies, more matureand financially substantial than they were before. I can testify that theseTexas cadres had unusual influenceon the “new left” in its heyday, and so can extrapolate that this may reflect anational phenomena. If so, Ibelieve that strategically located Satanists can exercise a directing influenceon a political factor which maywell become, even more than it was before, anticlerical in nature.This is a matter already of my own personal activities here in the state, thoughit hasn’t gone muchfarther than collecting information on what’s going down. I present thesethoughts to you on the suppositionthat members of the IV° will grow increasingly interested in the whole gamut ofpolitical machinations asthe economic crisis deepens. Also this is the arena of my own concept of GreaterMagic - not the highestmagic, by any means, but magic that is capable of directing the ordering ofsociety. To be frank, I alreadyhave plenty of bedtime fun, food, and nice toys. I want power. I play with smallpolitical sects on a statelevel now, but in times of crisis relative positions can change very quickly.When they do, I intend to beamong the first in line. Prosperity. 635To Pipkin I replied:Your point is well taken that a forthcoming political backlash would result in arenewal offundamentalism. But I do not think it would serve our interests - or yours -were we to place the Church ofSatan squarely in the path of such a wave. As I suggested in “Quo Vadis? ”,Satanists must rise above mobmotivations, channeling social movements for their own benefit no matter whichway the tide appears toturn. The guiding impetus behind every religion has always been a core ofSatanists who, seeing apsychological need manifest in their mass-followers, concocted a ceremonialmythos to satisfy that need -and to ensure their continued domination as prophets, philosophers, and/orpriests.A young lady journalist in Pennsylvania recently asked me whether I expected aneo-Christian backlashto affect either Wicca or Satanism. I responded:“Satanists prey upon non-Satanists. All conventional religions are symptomaticof a ‘security blanket’mentality on the part of the adherents, whether worship be directed towardsAllah, Yahweh, a mother-goddess, or a ten-foot-tall red jelly bean. Whether Wicca gains or losesconverts from Protestant or Catholicgroups is unimportant, since there is no essential distinction between them. Andany wave of persecutionthat arises will bypass us, since we are in social positions to instigate andchannel such developments, not tobe opposed by them.”Indeed we have studied the means through which such dynamic movements asCommunism andNational Socialism rose to power. But the ostensible leaders of both movementswere themselves led bythose whom we may regard as the actual Satanists. The Nazi philosophers havebecome comparativelywell-known: Rosenberg, Haushofer, Eckart, et al. Lenin lived in the politicalshadow of such keypersonalities as Rasputin, S.G. Nechayev (whom Dostoyevsky portrayed in ThePossessed), andChernyshevsky (author of the political novel What is to be Done? ). Both Nazisand Communists had, inother words, their guardian Dæmons.So, for that matter, did the United States - in there from the beginning. TheMaster among them wasBenjamin Franklin [see Daniel Mannix’ The Hell-Fire Club]. Close behind him wereMadison, Paine,Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. Washington, while he was capable enough in hisown element, was notamong them. Neither were Revere and Hancock, although both spent a good deal oftime in the limelight.Consider well the statement of Satan in this forthcoming Cloven Hoof. Brilliancecannot beinstitutionalized. Men who seek to perpetuate their accomplishments byestablishing governments to apethem are guilty of folly. Only a concept that is intrinsically greater thanhumans can survive. To do so it willundergo continual semantic metamorphosis, because it will surface in differentcultures at different points intime.The key to the political strength of Satanism is that it is the most powerful ofall trans-human concepts.Those who realize this and act upon it are virtually invulnerable.I had contact with such early student movements as the FSM, SNCC, VDC, SDS, etc.So intimately thatI had, when I desired it, immediate access to their key leaders. But I joinednone of them, for I looked ahead635 Letter, Paul Pipkin to M.A. Aquino, November 16, IX/1974.- 341 -and tried to visualize the real consequence of each one. The net effect of eachsuch movement was toaggravate popular feeling against its leaders. Each leader succeeded in becominga darling of the press, buteach one also virtually destroyed his access to true political influence in thiscountry. Students have always“rebelled”. Youth is always idealistic. The leaders of society make a big showof giving them a hearing, butactually they laugh up their sleeves at them.The United States is indeed keyed for a tremendous right-wing politicalbacklash. “Now” may beanytime from about X/1975 to XV/1980. Anyone who stands out as a socialist orleftist will be crucified.All that is needed is a “Pearl Harbor” to galvanize public opinion first. I missmy guess if we don’t see sucha “Pearl Harbor” relatively soon.In Hoof #IV-4 (April VII/1972), speaking about the Nazis, I said:“The true message of the episode is simply that there was nothing within theNazi philosophy thatconflicts with the basic desires of the human personality. Accordingly attemptsto moralize at the Nazis’expense are unrealistic. Worse than that, they are dangerous in that they breedan unmerited complacency incontemporary civilization.”It can happen here, and it probably will. No jackboots and swastikas, of course.American flags, Sousamarches, hard-hats, Minutemen-type paramilitary groups, and so forth. The NewLeft will wither beforesuch an onslaught. Most of our student demagogues are frightened children whenpush comes to shove.If a “Pearl Harbor” does not occur, then the United States runs the risk of anational disintegration thatwill make the fall of the Roman Empire seem like peanuts - because two-thirds ofthe world’s economic andmaterial resources are owned, controlled, and developed by this country. It isfor this same reason that anyfears of nuclear war instigated by the Socialist/Communist bloc are ridiculous.Even if a retaliation were notforthcoming, such an aggressor would commit world suicide. And don’t you believethey don’t know it.In The Limits to Growth by D.H. Meadows et al., the effects of such a materialapocalypse are spelledout by an international team of scientists aided by the computer center of theMassachusetts Institute ofTechnology. This book was profiled by the Hoof two years ago. Now the samesubject is on everybody’slips, and scores of “doomsday” books are on the racks. Becoming popular hasparadoxically made thisproblem all the worse, because so many ineffectual groups and committees will beformed to “deal” with itthat the public will become complacent and bored. But the gut of the problemwill remain, to confront us“at Philippi”.You concluded your letter by saying that you want power. Fine, Our Lord Satancan give you power,but the Devil’s gifts do not contain automatic safeguards that will prevent therecipient from being injuredor destroyed through excess. Consider the parable of King Midas.

Our Lord Satan will see that key doors are opened foryou. 636 [index_split_013.html#p341]636 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Paul Pipkin, November 25, IX/1974.- 342 -[index-343_1.jpg]- 343 -If IX/1974 were in fact the “Year of the Media” as far as the Church of Satanwas concerned, then itwas largely the Grottos and officials of the nation that were responsible forattracting those media. IX/1974 was the high point of Grotto and regional Conclave activity in the saga ofthe Church.True, the pioneer Grottos - Central, Nineveh, Plutonian, and Babylon - had longsince ceased tofunction, but in their place had arisen a second generation: Lilith, Typhon(Dayton), Phœnix, Asmodeus,Amon, Karnak, and Yuggoth. These younger Grottos were led by Priests andPriestesses who had wontheir black medallions largely through study and experience independent of 6114California Street, theironly links being Anton LaVey’s books, the Cloven Hoof, the Articles of Protocol,and occasional bulletinsfrom the LaVeys or myself.The atmosphere of these later Grottos, therefore, was one in which Anton LaVeywas less an activeleader than an intellectual and magical symbol. This is not to say that he wasrespected or admired any theless. Indeed his new image was more profound and sophisticated, since it didn’tdepend upon his beingentertaining or charismatic.On the other hand, the new Grottos’ lack of personal contact with him had begunto make him lessessential to the Church, though in IX/1974 no one could have conceived of aChurch of Satan withouthim. Furthermore his symbolic image, being a product of photographs, letters,articles, and books, was farmore vulnerable than an image built up through personal contact.Two critical events took place in IX/1974 which would ultimately weaken theloyalty of the newGrottos to Anton’s person. The first was the publication of The Devil’s Avenger,a biography which, whilefascinating to those who knew Anton personally, proved to be highlydisillusioning to those who hadknown him only as a symbol.The second event was Anton’s decision to break up the network of communicationand contact whichthe new Grottos and “field” Priesthood had built up independent of SanFrancisco. This decision,announced as “Phase IV” of the Church of Satan’s Master Plan, was at firsthesitantly accepted and thenincreasingly defied. But to understand these phenomena in context, a moredetailed picture of the year’sevents is necessary.As IX/1974 commenced, the Lilith Grotto in New York had reached the zenith ofits size andinfluence, earning the interest and admiration of the eastern avant-garde butalso the ill-concealed and ill-humored envy of its Wiccan rivals. One “white witch” provided the followingcaustic account for aPhiladelphia magazine article:LaVey’s alleged contact in the New Jersey-Philadelphia area was Lilith Sinclair,a High Priestess in theChurch of Satan and founding agent of the Church’s Spotswood, New Jersey Grotto.When Lilith began working the territory, she was assisted by a boyfriend who wasa publicist. His mainjob was to break the ice with the press by calling the local papers every timethere was an unsolved murder- 344 -with a 100-mile radius and haughtily declaring that Lilith Sinclair, the witchof Spotswood, had nothing todo with it. When the inevitable “Lilith who?” was the response, the scam was on.The reporter would then be invited to a witching-hour, cloak-and-daggerrendezvous with Lilith, spoon-fed a couple of hours’ worth of Satanic mumbo-jumbo, charmed with a few long,soulful stares from thesexy Devil-woman, and sent on his way to pen a gee-whiz feature about the latestoccult superstar. It wasgood PR, and it made a lot of ink.Lilith Sinclair barnstormed and lectured her way from Princeton to Paoli,hard-selling the Church ofSatan. In the process she incurred the undying enmity and evil zaps not only ofwhite witches, who felt thatshe was sullying the good name of their craft, but also the jealousy ofquick-buck occultists throughout thearea, who resented LaVey’s big league incursion into the Philadelphia market.637The actual lecture technique of Lilith Sinclair is evident from the manynewspaper accounts quoted inthis history. There was no “hard-sell”, and there was certainly no “scam”. Onthe other hand the ex-Barbizon model regularly attracted far more attention than most of theunsophisticated and repulsive slobswho passed for “white witches”, and this is probably the real reason for theirhatred of her.The Lilith Grotto’s initial IX report to San Francisco is illustrative of theenergetic, creative harmonyprevalent in the group at the time:The Lilith Grotto has relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey, across the riverfrom New York City. Thenew location is a great deal more spacious and affords a separate room for theritual chamber. The chamberitself is done in silver and black, with flames leaping from the tops of thewalls on to the ceiling. Strobelights, mirrors, and audio frequencies are used for various effects.Meetings have continued on a biweekly schedule, alternating between the Templeof the Flames inSpotswood and the Temple of the Dæmons in New York City. Members of SchamballahCircle inPhiladelphia, headed by Warlock Tom Bari, continue to attend Lilith Grottomeetings and functions.A major change in format was instituted during January. This was the eliminationof celebrating a ritualat every meeting, and the utilization of non-ritual gatherings as study groups,with the Satanic Bible beingthe first subject.It has proved to be a wise move, as most members were eager to discuss theSatanic Bible and to offertheir observations and interpretations of each section. Members who hadpreviously sat silent in mostdiscussions opened up and expounded with great enthusiasm.It has also become clear to them that performance of rituals for their own sakeis meaningless andmechanical. The results are most satisfying. When there is a need for a specificritual, it is a strong,powerful, and most successful working.We have also started a series of experiments using orgone accumulators andpyramids made ofalternating layers of styrofoam, cardboard, and aluminum foil. The experimentswill be continued over aperiod of several months. At the conclusion a complete report will be sent toCentral Grotto, along withindividual experimental data. 638To the northeast of Lilith’s territory lay New England, and the Church ofSatan’s Regional Agent inthat area was Warlock Robert Jzamon DeCecco. As VIII/1973 drew to a close, hedecided to begin aregional newsletter of his own to test the waters for a possible Grotto.Assisting him were two otherSatanists, Clifford J. Case and John E. Renaud (who had been a frequentparticipant in Lilith Grottoactivities). One of DeCecco’s earliest articles, in this Straight From Hellnewsletter, is at Appendix #100.Two particularly interesting external commentaries on the Church of Satan sawprint early in the year -a generally critical one (Appendix #101) in Plain Truth, the fundamentalistmagazine of Herbert andGarner Ted Armstrong’s Worldwide Church of God, and a generally favorable - ifstill nervous - one(Appendix #102) in a short-lived but well-presented magazine entitled Occult.637 Mallowe, Mike, “That Old Black Magic”, Philadelphia magazine, October 1976,page #210.638 Sinclair, Lilith, Lilith Grotto Report - January/February IX, February 20,IX/1974.- 345 -The Occult article was particularly pleasing to me in that it was the firstoutside analysis of the qualityof the Cloven Hoof.All was bright lights for the Church of Satan - until a startling letter arrivedat 6114 from MagisterCharles Steenbarger in Denver. Nothing had been heard of the Plutonian Grottosince the NorthglennIncident [see Chapter #11], and it had been assumed that the Grotto haddisbanded. Apparently this wasnot the case. It had continued to meet at Steenbarger’s home, though notpublishing a newsletter normaintaining any contacts with other Grottos. Now Steenbarger announced:Enclosed are three membership cards which have been pulled at the suggestion ofthe High Priestess.Why there are not more will become evident as the narrative wears on. Inaddition to pulling the cards, Ihave removed the Church’s sanction of any meetings involving the members andtheir affiliation with theChurch, to be removed or rendered permanent at the discretion of the CentralGrotto. I also requestedmembers to remove from their homes or disperse any documents or materials whichcould identify themwith the Church in case any one of them got busted during the current crackdownon drugs in Denver.I hope that this little bit of preventative action will forestall another“Detroit”. I won’t engage in a lot oftheorizing about what happened here, since I have not been close enough to theGrotto to have gatheredenough information for a sound explanation. But it does seem that affiliationwith the Church hasconstituted for many of the members a sanction for living the kind of life thatthe Church has refuted by itsteachings. In risking their own reputations they have also risked that of mineand the Church. Accordingly Ifeel that we owe them nothing; and we would demean ourselves if we took an easystand on the crisis theyhave precipitated for themselves. Here are the essential facts as reported bysome of the members whofinally broke silence as soon as they became panicky. Unfortunately I did notbecome aware of thesematters until recently, well after Judiy Good’s return from San Francisco.Judiy was recently taken to the City Hospital’s emergency room after slashingher wrists in a suicideattempt. She reported nothing at all about this to me, or any of the eventsleading up to it, some of whichinvolved her use of cocaine (which she appears to be addicted on) and herassociation with those in Denverwho push it. But I learned the details from other members. A week ago the policehauled in 5 million dollarsworth of cocaine and arrested more than a dozen of Judiy’s friends who wereinvolved in the operation. Oneof them is a close associate of Judiy’s syndicate boy friend.Both Chuck Prentice and Jill Kirkpatrick have been busted - Jill just recently -for possession of grass.Jill’s home was raided by five narcotic agents. She is now out of jail on bond.Chuck Prentice, while waitingto appear in court, brought grass to a Grotto meeting and proceeded to light up,to the dismay of TomCondon, a new member.A few weeks ago I learned that cocaine was on the premises and being used duringthe last meeting Iattended. The operation was being conducted in the bathroom away from myattention. So I guess youknow where I stand in relation to that bunch of half-developed crooks now!Through my contacts with the DA’s office, I learned that Prentice, Kirkpatrick,and Good are underclose surveillance by the Narcotics Division and Denver Vice Squad. Hence theneed for dispersing this“bunch” before we undergo another “Detroit”. Drug usage is widespread enough toreduce the Grotto normto an unsafe level of mediocrity, and a level which would quickly alienate anygood new members. TheGrotto was apparently governed by victims of blind compulsion whose style oflife refuted andmisrepresented the Church of Satan while heedlessly running the risk ofunfavorably exposing the wrongimage of the Church to the people of Denver. I guess all this is the consequenceof those who have not yetlearned that total indulgence and survival depend upon superior discipline andwill to power as well as theability to cater to one’s needs. Since this is so, I find that I cannotrepresent the Church of Satan and theDenver Grotto at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive of one another.Now as to the members. Prentice, Kirkpatrick, and Good appear to be the activecontributors to thismess. I am not sending on Prentice’s card because he tore it up during a recentmeeting and a fight over oneof the members. This is an excellent example of the level of maturity whichcontributed to this crisis.Silent or condoning partners but who probably have no involvement with drugs areLela Country, RuthLeserman, and Gayle Gregory. Gayle may now be listed at Central Grotto underanother surname. Hermembership has expired. Ruth claims she has lost her membership card. Lela andGayle sent their cards to- 346 -me under the wrong address, and they appear to be lost now. They are eitherlying, or, what is moreprobable, they are telling the truth about the lack of concern and thecarelessness with which they deal withtheir memberships.Steenbarger’s solution to the debacle recallrf the one he had proposed for theNorthglenn Incident:A new order should be established specifying a higher order of recruiting. Suchcriteria as job andresidential stability, emotional maturity, good intelligence, freedom from drugusage, and an alreadyexisting competence in all areas of indulgence I believe are totally necessaryif we are to endure withoutthese kinds of crises. 639It was difficult to decide whether to feel sympathy or contempt for Steenbarger.On one hand he wasan extremely nice fellow, and apparently he would tolerate nothing less than theoptimum standards fromthe Plutonians. On the other hand it seemed that he had managed to admit apretty sorry lot of Satanists,who had succeeded in pulling the wool over his eyes for years. How difficult isit to sense whethersomeone at a Grotto meeting is hyped on drugs - particularly when theMagister/Grotto Leader is aclinical psychologist by profession? And Steenbarger’s solution was really nosolution, since he wasmerely invoking the membership standards which the Church of Satan hadofficially maintained for years.From Santa Barbara I enquired of Anton LaVey whether I should concern myselfwith the Denvercatastrophe. He replied that the situation seemed beyond repair and that it wasbetter to allow it to gasp itslast without bringing it to the attention of the rest of the Church, which couldonly serve to demoralizeothers. And so the Church did not hear about it. But Anton himself did, and ofcourse it was one morestraw on his back where lack of confidence in the Grotto system was concerned.Otherwise the only Church-wide impact of the death of Plutonian was that itcaused me to scrap theplans for the West-II Conclave in Denver. I began to search for a more upbeatSatanic climate.At this time Anton LaVey was still torn between a more aggressive and a moreclandestine profile forthe Church. The bad Grottos might be awful, but the good Grottos were fantastic.The High Priest sensedthat he headed by far the most powerful and energetic occult movement in thecountry, and occasionalstatements by would-be competitors downplaying the Church’s importance genuinelyangered him.Following a remark of mine concerning some new Wiccan anti-Satan propaganda, hewrote to me:Now to your gripe, which is indeed valid: I too am so tired of the cliché “Weare witches, notSatanists!” that I have decided to do something about it - in this case the onething that will hurt ourdetractors the most: aid and accelerate their anguish.We must proceed on the basis that there were no organized witchcraft covens inthe U.S. before the C/S.For the first years of our publicity witches denounced “organization” asantithetical to their beliefs. Onlyafter they saw us grow in notoriety did they pull a monkey-see, monkey-do andstart to form all sorts ofsects, alliances, and “churches”. Verily, we gave them the green light to makewitchcraft the secular andorganized (?) phenomenon it has become. I can still hear the vitriolicdenouncements of me from parvenuwitches for my “racketeering, commercialized, inauthentic, publicity-seeking”gall in creating anorganization. Now things have certainly changed.I think it would be just dirty of us to start to assume credit for the entireU.S. witchcraft movement aswell as Satanism, for indeed we are entitled to such claim. When the C/S waswell underway as anorganization, Sybil Leek’s fans were a staunchly nonsocial lot, with Sybilherself still playing straight-manto Holzer’s house-haunting act. There were no seminars, classes, school courses,etc. such as you attendedat 6114 extant.In short, the nitwits’ attempt to single out “Satanists” as a breed apart isn’tborn so much of disdain ordisagreement, but because we “got there firstest with the mostest”. And byisolating themselves and theirshticks from “Satanism” they hope to lend individuality to themselves.639 Letter, Charles Steenbarger to Anton LaVey, February 23, IX/1974.- 347 -The media, the Christian evangelists, and the unenlightened public - bless them- keep lumping witchesand Satanists together, no matter how loudly the witches scream for uniquerecognition. Let us further gallthem by encouraging such confusion. Whatever robs them of their shaky identitiesis good. You know thattheir problem is based on one inadequacy: lack of identity. That’s why there areso many different sectsand schools of “Wicca”; everybody can be a High Priest or Priestess. Or at leasta Kingfish.Let’s pull the rug out from under the sectarianism the Wiccans have developedand expose it for what itis: a bunch of little people who didn’t get there first ego-tripping on aplethora of “authentic”, “historically-valid”, “recognized”, “traditional”, ad nauseam sects which have erupted likeboils on the back of theDragon. I think it’s time to lance the boils (Wasn’t he a medic on T.V. - LanceBoils, M.D.?). In fact I don’teven think such measures will be necessary; the antibiotic of confusion shouldsuffice to pop thestubbornest carbuncle.The issue of Time covering the psychics was great, and JMK wrote a lettertelling them so. What aphony bunch of Wiccans in lab coats most of those birds are! I’ll wager not onein ten “parapsychologists”would recognize a genuinely untoward situation if confronted with it. I’ve nodoubt that you’ve witnessedmore outré happenings than all the SRI, Duke U., etc. codgers put together.Those guys never see, test, orcome up with much of anything valid.If you had an ultrasonic raygun that would fit into a fountain pen, or a meansof “clouding men’sminds”, would you be so quick to let anyone else in on it? When I hear about theTed Serioses and UriGellers and how they are knocking them dead, well … I only wish we had more timeto devote todiscussing these things firsthand, like about two hundred years.There is such a thing as “magic”, and wonders are indeed possible within itsprecincts. Most of whatyou see around you now, however, is truly what Time called “a substitute faith”.Not that it bothers memuch, for each substitute faith leads the public a step away from those who havebecome stifling andparasitic to the Great God Flux.Even though the present crises are an inconvenience, the end result will be toour taste. We did bringthem on ourselves, and we will have to sit them out. I personally find it quitefascinating - like watching theCircus Maximus. Chaos is ensuing nicely, and a catastrophic event is in theimmediate offing. I’d better signoff before I start sounding evil. 640A surprise letter arrived from J.P. Hoff, who, it will be recalled, was one ofthe “underground clergy”Anton had ordained in VII/1972 [see Chapter #19]:I have been giving the matter of more active participation in the Churchconsiderable thought, and I feelthat my current preference is still to maintain “cover” and not yet assume amore active role because of thebasic changes in my business life which could be jeopardized.I feel that any degrees of personal success I might obtain and have obtained aredue to my Satanicattitudes and positive approaches, and I am more than ever a staunch supporterof the Church and writingsof Dr. LaVey, whom I greatly admire.I would appreciate your advising me how I could work more actively andeffectively within my presentsituation and as a Priest of Mendes, but right now I feel that my publicexposure is necessarily limited. Thiswill not always be necessarily so for the future. In the meantime I would liketo be in contact directly withsome local members and be of assistance, behind the scenes, to a new area GrottoLeader for Vancouver.I would appreciate hearing from you and would look forward with great pleasureto meeting yousometime. I have admired your various writings in the Church bulletins. 641I had been a good soldier and not said anything to Hoff or any other“underground” clergy about myimpatience with their silence and inaction. Hoff’s letter opened the door to thechicken coop for the fox,however, and the fox was quick to jump. I replied to J.P.:640 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 6, IX/1974.641 Letter, J.P. Hoff to M.A. Aquino, March 8, IX/1974.- 348 -There are a number of ways through which you can become more involved with theChurch on ananonymous basis. You can adopt a pseudonym and send articles to variouspublications. You can give radiointerviews on a similar basis. You can contribute articles to one or more of theregional newsletters beingpublished within the Church. You can take the initiative in announcing theproposed formation of a localGrotto in the local paper, inviting interested parties to reply by mail to apost office box. And so forth. Butas long as you’ve brought up the subject of “cover”, let’s talk about the entireconcept for a moment.When you’ve just been ordained to the Satanic Priesthood, the idea of “goingpublic” scares you todeath. You have visions of all of your old friends rejecting you, the bossfiring you, your credit rating goingto zero, your house being firebombed, your children being harassed at school,and your dog being poisoned.Someone may even take a shot at you.At the time of my own ordination, I was living in Kentucky - the heart of the“bible belt” in the UnitedStates. I had a wife, a four-year-old daughter, and a brand-new son. I was anofficer in the Army, and Ithought it entirely possible that the government would find some technicalexcuse to rid itself of such acontroversial personage. And that would have done a substantial amount of damageto my lifelong careeropportunities, besides negating eight years of training and experience. Therewere a million reasons why Icould have remained clandestine. Instead I gave a lecture at the University ofLouisville, organized a localGrotto, and embarked upon a very aggressive public relations program for theChurch of Satan. I used myown name whenever I appeared personally, employing an alias only for newspaperinterviews that wouldreach an extremely wide spectrum of the populace. But even that became passévery quickly, as my truename soon became a household word in the area. As it turned out, there were nosubstantial problems. Ienjoyed acceptable diplomatic relations with other religious sects inLouisville. I didn’t get bombed. Andthe Army thought it was a good deal of fun to have a Black Magician on thefaculty of the Armor School.Subsequently I left the Army and took an executive position with the largest andmost conservativesecurities firm in the country - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. I movedto Santa Barbara, one of themost ultraconservative cities in this state. I gave the community precisely oneyear to get acquainted withme, and then I gave a no-holds-barred interview to the newspaper. Again notrouble.Of course there is a risk. We have had at least one Priest and one Priestessfired from their jobs becauseof their announced office with the Church of Satan. Children of our known clergyhave had a rough time ofit at school. There have been some incidents of vandalism. Nevertheless I haveyet to encounter a Priest orPriestess who, having “gone public”, regrets the decision. Why?First of all, we know damned well that we’ve done nothing of which to beashamed. We’re proud of theChurch, and we get mad when we see some irresponsible journalist or rabidevangelist drag its namethrough the mud. Satanists are supposed to be the supermen of the world. Whythen should any of us -especially the ordained Priesthood - turn tail and hide when someone even hintsthat we are “dirty”?Secondly, we can’t help thinking about a certain gentleman named Anton SzandorLaVey. He took apublic stand on this when there was not yet anything at all like aninternational organization to back him up- and when “Satanism” was considered an outright synonym for graveyarddesecration, drug traffic, white-slavery, and rape/murder - to say nothing of ritual child sacrifice. He has awife, two young daughters, and aknown address in San Francisco.I could tell you stories about the abuses he and his family have endured for thesake of the Church, but Ithink you can concoct a pretty good idea on your own. Suffice it to say thatanyone except Anton LaVeywould have thrown in the towel long before now. But he believes in what he isdoing, and that is that.The High Priest regards the Priesthood of Mendes as sacred. He does not grant itcasually. When hedoes grant it, he de facto allows the recipient to partake of the “glamorousnotoriety” that he has won overthe years. So many of us reason that, since we’re sharing in his glory, we oughtto mount the barricadeswith him as well. Simple as that. Finally there is the question of the Priest’sresponsibility to the honor ofOur Lord Satan. Obviously this is a matter between the individual and hisconscience. And there is nevergoing to be a “good” time to “go public”. When you’re just starting out in acareer, you’re afraid thatexposure will wreck your chances of advancement. When you’ve made it to the topof the heap, you’reafraid that exposure will destroy all that you have accomplished. As I saidearlier, you can always find amillion reasons why it makes more sense to keep your mouth shut. Good reasons…642642 Letter, M.A. Aquino to J.P. Hoff, March 14, IX/1974.- 349 -A copy of the letter went, as did copies of all my Church correspondence, to6114. I expected to havemy ears pinned back yet again, but to my surprise Diane commented: “Everythingof late, including yourletter to Hoff, is right on target. Anton’s barbed tail is wagging regularly!”643 Be that as it may, Hoff wasnot heard from further - until XXI/1986, when he was accepted into the Temple ofSet as a Setian I°.Back in New York, Lilith Sinclair finished moving her Grotto to new headquartersin March and hadcontinued her heavy schedule of appearances on behalf of the Church:Your observations concerning the need for a sanctuary where one can shut oneselfaway fromeverything were right on the nose, so to speak. There is already an atmosphereof peace and steady power inmy ritual chamber. It was a bit of a surprise, as it has not been used more thana few times and is notcompleted yet. When I enter it to just sit quietly, however, the strength of thepower-flow around me istangible and immediate. It is truly the domain of the Dark Lord and has left mewith an intense pride that Iam also of his domain. You most certainly must know how I feel, so I will nottry to detail it further exceptto say that it is beautiful and awesome, and that it leaves me with a mostprofound respect for the Lord OfThis World.The Pat Collins Show went beautifully. Wait ’til you hear who was on with me:Jesus Christ. That’swhat I said - Jesus Christ. This character is the leader of a West Virginiasnake-handling cult. His name isBrother Julius, and he says that in 1949 he had an out-of-the-body experienceand saw God. God told himhe was actually his son, Jesus, and so ever since then he’s been going around assuch. Here’s the punch:When asked how he supported himself, he said, “Oh, my people love me so muchthat they mortgage theirhouses and turn the money over to me!”It was really great. I was holding forth with Satanic logic and intelligence,and here was this screwballsaying “the last time I talked to my father, God …”. Of course the audience wereshaking their heads andsaying what a con-artist or just plain nut he was. I dressed the Compleat Witchto the hilt, and turned out tobe the only woman in the place wearing a dress. I really caused an uproar - andloved every minute of it!644From Forrest J Ackerman I had heard about a Los Angeles organization called theCount DraculaSociety. It sounded like fun, whatever it was, so I filled out an application,forwarded a $10 check, andwas rewarded with a gold-leafed pot metal bat pin, a misspelled membership card,and an invitation to theSociety’s awards banquet in Los Angeles. Well, why not? I recounted the resultsto Anton LaVey:This past Saturday evening I drove down to L.A., picked up Dale Seago, andproceeded to theAlexandria Hotel for the awards banquet of the Count Dracula Society. Amongthose present were ForrestAckerman, Ray Bradbury, A.E. Van Vogt, Richard Matheson, Elsa Lanchester, and anumber of evidently-notable motion picture directors and producers. About half of the personsselected for awards were there.Three who were not were Jack Palance, Dan Curtis, and Christopher Lee.It was soon evident that the organization orbits around the person of Donald A.Reed, a professionallibrarian who wears his Litt.D. like a badge of rank. He is, in a word, a prig.He seemed neither particularlyimpressed nor put off by the knowledge that two Church of Satan officials werepresent. He does not seemto be familiar with the organization at all. 645At the dinner I had had some nice conversations concerning the Church of Satanwith Ray Bradbury,Francis Lederer, William Marshall (Blackula), and of course Forry Ackerman.Anton’s reply, a few dayslater, was both colorful and educational:643 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, undated, ca. March 15, IX/1974.644 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, March 8, IX/1974.645 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, April 10, IX/1974.- 350 -Your report on the Draculans was blunt and to the point, and served up a vividpicture of theproceedings. Now it is my duty to sharpen the point (stake?). The turnout wasnot surprising, as all “open”fan-type conventions pack them in. I have seen the same kind of idolatry run thegamut from UFO to Sci-Ficons - everywhere from the Leamington Hotel in Oakland to theBelleview-Stratford in Philly.And the celebs - at least some - always manage to turn up. When you know thepublishing game, yousoon realize that these turnouts are nothing more than glorified bookstoreautograph parties for the celebsinvolved, whose bread and butter depend upon a modicum of contact with theirmost avid constituents. Thisis not sour grapes, but a distillation of that of which you should be aware.Dr. Donald A. Reed is full of shit, and your analysis is most accurate. He knowsfucking well about theC/S. For Volume I, Number 3 of the CDS Quarterly (1968), they came with theirbegging bowls to do astory on us, which appeared in that issue. The rest of the issue, dedicated toKarloff, was a report on theirsixth annual bash. The interview with a guy named LaVey was one of the featuresof the fanzine, eventelling the readers how they might get in touch with us re membership. I was tobe presented with anhonorary membership if I would return the favor. I didn’t. My reasons werevalid.Reed is a joke in H’wood, despite the “producers and directors” who attend hisfunctions. The reason heis a joke is obvious. You met him. Bill Murray could have done the same thinghad he not been inWinnemucca, and - though it pains me to admit it - probably better!Reed had a good case of Reichian character armor when you and Dale confrontedhim, hence hisnoncommittal mien. His “awards” are like many of our members’ “awards”. Forgetabout “Dr.” Reed.Please send him what Casey struck, nothing more.Palance is a gruff old boozer who didn’t show because he couldn’t care less.He’d rather get on a talkshow and sing “Don’t Bring Lulu” or “Roll Me Over in the Clover”. Lee has gottentoo big for his shroud toassociate with such goings-on, and pious in the bargain. Don’t know the story onCurtis. When you contactRay Bradbury, mention Art Lyons as a fellow-traveler. Bradbury likes him. Also afair bet is Lederer, whocan’t do us much good but is a tradition everyone knows and apparently an O.K.guy.Bill Marshall is a winner, and I’ve no doubt you made a hit with him. He’s intothe CDS because there’sno better place to go for his Gothicks. Flip Wilson (“The Devil made me do it!”)is ripe. He will have to bepried away from a hysterical faggot mitt reader named “Dr.” Kenny Kingston, a“gifted psychic” who hassurfaced in the last year and makes Jeanne Dixon appear like Paracelsus bycomparison. Typhon does abetter cold reading than this Kingston bird, but he gave Flip a call andconvinced him that his psyche wasready for expansion. Wilson likes the Devil and has proclaimed as much publicly.Another guy who’s a Satanist in action and words, if not outspoken Gothicks, isdirector John Huston.Read up on his stuff, and on his pa’s acting roles, and see what I mean. He maybe your next big coup.Please talk to me before you approach him, though.The more “Doctors” I see in print, the more I want to shuck the title. I cantake it with Forry because ofhis innate sense of humor. In fact he should add “Mad” as a prefix. Trouble is,too many would take himliterally. I may start calling myself “Grand Exalted Caliph and Satrap of theInfernal Empire and its MyriadBolgas, Imperial Vizier of the Plutonian Legions, Magistrate Plenipotentiary ofthe Court of the CrimsonKing, Almighty Tunafish of the Mystic Knights of the Sea, His Most OmnipotentExcellency Herr DocktorInspector General Tony LaVey, Bart (‘Bay Area Rapid Transit’, that is)”. Forshort they can call me “Tony”.I can remember when they would yell “Is there a doctor in the house?”. It meantsomeone was sick orinjured. It always referred to an M.D. In fact an old burlesque gag went: Amatronly Jewish lady in theaudience would suddenly stand up during the performance and yell “Is there adoctor in the house?”. Adoctor would arise from his seat, saying “Yes, madame, can I be of assistance?”.To which the old blisterwould reply: “Yes, I’d like you to meet my daughter.” Now everybody’s a doctor.In fact I bet there aremore doctors than Jewish mothers. 646As a matter of fact, Anton’s analysis of the Dracula Society turned out to beright on target, to includethe individuals he mentioned. None of them [with the exception of ForrestAckerman] ever took anyfurther interest in the Church of Satan, even to the extent of acknowledging thecomplimentary Satanic646 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 12, IX/1974.- 351 -Bible and Satanic Rituals copies I sent per my discussions with them during thedinner. I was learning afew more things about that mysterious realm called “Hollywood” - which is notthe same thing as the citybearing that name!As Anton mentioned above, Time had recently come out with a cover story on “thepsychics”. I had setthe article aside, thinking that it might be a good takeoff point for a ClovenHoof article on the subject.The result was “Psi in the Sky” (Appendix #103), lead article for theMarch-April issue.Simultaneously there was an avalanche of regional news and newsletters from allover the country.DeCecco’s Straight From Hell was beginning to gather speed and confidence, asAppendix #104 shows,while in Washington, D.C. Robert Ethel’s Asmodeus Grotto had constructed abeautiful Walpurgiscommemoration from Crowley and other mythological sources (Appendix #105). FromDayton theRatley-Artley Newsletter, a joint project of Agents Thomas Huddleston and ArthurZabrecky of Cleveland,checked in with Colleen Huddleston’s article on talk-show technique (Appendix#106). And in the May-June Straight From Hell was the poignant story of the Amon Grotto’s foundingmeeting (Appendix #107).Upon reading it I wrote to Warlock DeCecco:I would like to thank you for the latest copy of Straight From Hell. Each issuegets better and better. Imiss my guess if your pilot group doesn’t begin to grow very swiftly once theword gets around. Thenewsletter - via subscription - will also serve as a most important link forSatanists who, for one reason oranother, cannot be on hand for all of the meetings.I paid particular attention to Miss Allee’s account of your March 10thorganizational dinner. I echo heradmiration for you and Warlock Renaud, who have taken the initiative tointroduce the Church in a materialform into the New England area. She may have a point concerning the“closed-minded, puritanical”atmosphere with which you have to contend, but New England is also vastlyimportant as a bulwark ofAmerican Satanism. I recall the activities at Salem, etc., as well as the impactof such local personages asH.P. Lovecraft. You have a tremendous amount of local tradition with which towork.Dr. LaVey has also been eyeing your progress with considerable interest. He isimpressed with themature assessment of the Satanic philosophy evidenced by the essays appearing inyour newsletter, and hehas asked me to monitor your progress quite closely. Please keep me advised ofyour progress, and let meknow what we can do to help. 647Warlock DeCecco responded:I am highly honored by your compliments on Straight From Hell and our progress,even though it isslow at present. I am sincerely grateful to you, and of course to our Magus, foryour interest andconsideration toward our growing group in New England. We are determined in ourwork and are sure thatwe can do much to further the tenets of Satanism in this part of the country.At present I am engaged in seeking out worthwhile neophytes for membershipconsideration. As youprobably realize, the task is an arduous one. I want to make our presence knownwithout wearing the coat ofsolicitation. Thus far, in two months, I have attracted one couple to our Order.You can well imagine thetypes who are attracted by our mysterious presence. These can be weeded outeasily at the first interview.The usual drug-oriented, sex-craving, and frustrated Christians who seek anexciting pastime will not, aslong as I am Regional Agent, get their hands on an application.Presently I am at work on a paper for East-VI, which I will attend, entitled“Suicide: Indulgence orCompulsion”. I am having afterthoughts, however, as I have found out that thesubject is deeper and morepsychoanalytic than I imagined. I have no formal education in psychiatry and amconcerned aboutpresenting my case without violation of ethics, where those people who monitorour brains are concerned.But I rationalize and admit that we are all Carl Jungs or Thomas Szaszs. We muststate our feelings nomatter what. Regarding Satanic self-awareness I feel that if we recognize ourshortcomings and talents, wecan use each to our advantage by testing it publicly. I have tried to do this inmy newsletter and essays, and647 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Robert DeCecco, June 3, IX/1974.- 352 -admittedly sometimes I feel incapable for a short while. As you know, there aresome brilliant people,including yourself, connected with our Order. I can never expect to reach theheights of some whom Iadmire greatly, but I feel that I can communicate and make my feelingsunderstood. For this I am grateful.Satanism has given me a way to contribute: to offer my feelings and views, myhelp where needed, and mysupport. I am indebted to the Church of Satan for its willingness to listen. 648DeCecco’s paper on the Satanic implications of suicide was in fact read by himat East-VI and wasvery well received. It is reproduced here as Appendix #108.At midyear there were two more distressing developments. First came the surpriseresignation ofMichael Grumboski from the Priesthood, which is discussed in detail in Chapter#32.Almost simultaneously came news of trouble in Karnak, which until now had seemedto be one of theChurch’s most trouble-free Grottos. Priestess Margaret Wendall wrote to “John M.Kincaid”:I am writing to let you know of a matter which is unpleasant, and which hurts medeeply in some ways,but which I would like in the open and for you to hear from me: Bubastis Chapelis severing allrelationships with the Reverends James and Dolores Stowe. Part of the reasonsare purely personal, but allof them demonstrate a virtual lack of Satanic responsibility on their part. Anexplanation is in order …On Walpurgisnacht of this year, both of the Stowes thoroughly “put down”Satanist John Arnold’sexcellent performance of the Messe Noire. As I understand the situation, theStowes recommended Mr.Arnold’s membership. Whatever has transpired on his part since then is no causefor the “put down”.Despite my earlier letter, I do not now feel that the Stowes ought toinvestigate the possibility of contractsinvolving the Church. And at this point I am not sure they do indeed exist. I aminvestigating this myself.On May 4th, at ritual here, both of the Stowes made fools of themselves. Many ofthe members whoattended were embarrassed by their actions and words. Early in the evening theyre-stated that KarnakGrotto had closed; after ritual they said it was open. I personally don’t carethat they did not like the ritualbeing performed, because I know why they didn’t like it: It did not exactlyfollow the sequence of therituals performed at the Central Grotto before its closing.I was not part of the conversation between Warlock William Murray and ReverendJames Stowe on ourpatio after ritual, but I understand from what my husband - a nonmember -overheard that it was notcomplimentary on Rev. Stowe’s part to the Church and the changes that are beingmade in it.I am not alone in feeling that the Stowes want glory, via newspaper coverage,and praise for theirbeautiful home without doing any of the work involved to keep a Grotto going.Their reasons for closingthe Grotto are plausible, but somehow, from the circumstances of May 4th, theyno longer ring true.I don’t think I’m alone in feeling, either, that the reason behind this camewith the arrival of the newProtocol, which states that we can’t plan to make money from our Priesthood inthe Church of Satan.Priestess Stowe has complained to me of that on more than one occasion.I freely admit that I make mistakes; I try not to make the same ones twice,though. I don’t insultmembers of the Church in the presence of others. I don’t talk about officialpolicy of the Church whennonmembers can overhear. [I must add that whether or not Warlock Murray knewthat my husbandoverheard any of the patio conversation, he did his level best to end it.] I donot belittle the functions of theChurch, public and private. And, along with nearly all other members, I do mybest to be responsible toother Satanists. This is my duty and privilege as a Priestess. I do not feel theStowes are currentlyconducting themselves in a manner befitting a Satanic Priest and Priestess. 649To me Diane LaVey commented:I don’t know what to say about the letter from Margaret Wendall. You know how Ifeel about her andMurray. My first reaction is that the Stowes were doers who made paper-pushersjealous. But I do know that648 Letter, Robert DeCecco to M.A. Aquino, June 5, IX/1974.649 Letter, Margaret Wendall to “John Kincaid”, May 29, IX/1974.- 353 -the Stowes have become, shall we say, in their cups on a couple of occasions andacted less than reverenttowards Priestess Wendall’s doings. And there seems to have been a coolingbetween the Stowes andMargaret Wendall over the past six months.I can’t help recalling something Murray said in one of his letters to you aroundsix or eight weeks ago. Idon’t have the letter handy, but it was something about either an accomplishmentfor which you hadcongratulated him or something of which you were telling him you were sure hewas capable. Anyway hemade reference to “despite what certain ‘officials’ of the Church might think orsay”, he thanked you orassured you he’d give it the old college try, or some such thing. Wish I hadtime to track it down, because Ithought at the time it sounded snide and was directed at the Stowes.Do you think we should send a copy of Margaret Wendall’s letter to the Stowes?They have alwaysbeen so straight with us that I hate to deal with this matter behind theirbacks. About a year ago,incidentally, I got wind of some rumblings between the Stowes and M.W., so Idropped M.W. a note askingher about it. She said that the report was false and that she had the highestrespect for the Stowes. I will beeager to know what you make of her letter. 650And I responded:As for sending a copy of Margaret Wendall’s letter to the Stowes, I’m inclinedto recommend against it.It would probably just aggravate things and ruin any chance of a reconciliationbetween them. The nexttime I go north, I’ll try to detour past Santa Cruz, pay a call on Jim &Dolores, and see if I can’t smooth afew feathers. But you’re a better judge of all this than I am, inasmuch as I’vemet the Stowes and Wendallonly briefly. 651And Anton pronounced judgment:Cannot buy the data re Stowes vs. Wendall. Much more than meets the eye. The ManDownstairs isinclined to smile upon the Stowes. 652If so, the Man Downstairs erred, since not long thereafter Jim and Dolores Stowewould fade out ofthe Church of Satan, while Margaret Wendall would go on to become one of thefounders and mostinfluential leaders of the Temple of Set. I would say that the Man Downstairschose to smile upon her.As the occasion arose, I still continued to assist the LaVeys with the seeminglyendless stream ofjournalistic inquiries that poured into the Church. One more amusing “interview”which I gave by letterwas to a young lady named Samantha Reber, who in midyear sent a series ofquestions to Anton which heasked me to handle. The questions and my answers, which were duly printed,appear as Appendix #109.One of the debates which continued to ebb and flow within the Church concernedthe literal existenceof Satan. I was beginning to become impatient with the prevalent ambiguity onthis matter, since Anton’sand my own thoughts concerning it were quite clear.For the July-August Cloven Hoof, therefore, I decided to address it head-on. Theresult was “QuoVadis? ” (Appendix #110). This article was not simply a statement to the rest ofthe Church, however; italso reflected my growing conviction that the “metaphorical vs. literal realityof the Devil” issue had goneon long enough. It was time for the Church of Satan to come to grips with itsname, once and for all.And on an even more personal level I was beginning to feel extraordinarily“intense” on the questionin a way I had not for years, as though something particularly significant wereabout to occur. Then inearly July I wrote to Diane LaVey:650 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 8, IX/1974.651 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, June 14, IX/1974.652 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 24, IX/1974.- 354 -Something very odd has been happening here recently. I found myself unable towork on the Satanichistory book. Instead I picked up the old Diabolicon materials and am “writing”new passages on an“automatic” basis like the first time. Peculiar mental atmosphere also, stillcontinuing. I feel strongly that Ishould not discuss whatever-it-is before it’s complete, but I will send it northto you when ready, wheneverthat is. 653“Whatever-it-is” was complete about a month later, after many evenings’torturous Workings. Stillundecided on what to do with it, I accepted an invitation to visit the LaVeyswith Lilith Sinclair, who hadsince returned to Santa Barbara. It was as charming a visit as ever, but I satstraight up in my chair whenAnton began to read from the notes he had been making towards a “Phase IV”announcement for theChurch. In private I asked him what must have seemed to him a strange question -but which was to me avery important one. Had he ever made a formal, written pact with Satan?Yes, said Anton, he had - back when the Church had been founded. He kept thepact with his mostprecious documents, such as his rare edition of The King in Yellow. But why didI want to know?It had to do with the document about which I had written to Diane, I said, but Ididn’t feel I shouldexplain why. Rather I must send him the text as soon as I returned to SantaBarbara where I had left it. OnAugust 9th I wrote to him:Once more I should like to thank you and Diane for the kind hospitality youshowed Lilith and myselfduring our trip north. The motion pictures were all fascinating, of course, butI most enjoyed just seeing thetwo of you again. And the musical visions you evoked through your concert organwere as magnificent asthey always are. After listening to you play, I find words miserable things.Under separate cover is the manuscript I spoke of in my July 8th letter toDiane. You were right on thetiming: almost precisely one month ago. You will see why I was so excited at thedecisions you announcedthis past weekend! And at your confirmation that you had indeed executed somesort of pact.Like the Diabolicon, this text left me feeling rather peculiar, to phrase itmildly. Rather than venture anyadditional comments on it, I’ll await your judgment.And I still have a “feeling” that there is more to come - presumably in“statement” form as per theDiabolicon. But I am not free to carry on at this time with anything assensitive as this.654The text which I sent to Anton LaVey was untitled, but it has since become knownsimply as the NinthSolstice Message. It is reproduced here as Appendix #111. Anton’s reply came afew days later, andreferred to the Samantha Reber interview as well as to the strange new text:Dear Mike:Just to let you know that the answers you supplied to the young lady journalistwere superbly Satanic -right in line with the new Phase. The follow-up to the Diabolicon was cyberneticin its timing and content.It pleases me that you perceive that which you do. All titles aside, you haveentered a new realm ofcomprehension, and truly deserve the name of “Satanist”.Anton655One of the problems of being the Church of Satan’s Eliot Ness was that I rarelyenjoyed the luxury ofbeing able to retire and contemplate the mysteries of Black Magic and Sataniccosmology. There wasalways a fire waiting to be put out [or lit under someone’s posterior].Now, just when I wanted to do nothing else than think about the Ninth SolsticeMessage, my attentionwas suddenly diverted ninety miles south of Santa Barbara. After the Plutoniandebacle had necessitated653 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, July 8, IX/1974.654 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, August 9, IX/1974.655 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, August 22, IX/1974.- 355 -the cancellation of the West-II plans for Denver, Dale Seago had offered to hostthe conclave in LosAngeles. He had made arrangements with the Holiday Inn in Brentwood, a large,circular tower at thejunction of the San Diego Freeway and Sunset Boulevard. Announcements were sentout, and everythingseemed fine until the Innkeeper suddenly decided to back out, on the pretextthat most of the attendeeswere not planning to stay at the hotel. West-II was torpedoed once again.To cheer up a disconsolate Dale Seago, Lilith and I invited him to Santa Barbaraover the weekend.With him he brought two of his new members in the Yuggoth Grotto, Mark andJanice Harris, and uponhis return home he wrote to “Lana Green”:Mark and Janice Harris were married at their apartment on 17 August. Paul andDiane Pipkin werepresent with the group, having come up from Texas for the Conclave only to findit canceled. One of theHarris’ bedrooms has been set aside and decorated as a ritual chamber [quite anice one], and it was therethat we held the ceremony. I think we were all impressed with its significance;no one said a word for someminutes after it was over.By the way, lest you think I’m lashing out at everyone in sight, I do like MarkHarris. He’s bright,articulate, and presents a good appearance. He seems to have a lot of potential.Janice is very quiet andretiring. I don’t know her well yet, but I have a good feeling about her.Incidentally - this is a purely subjective impression of mine, so don’t give itundue weight, but theinstant the wedding ritual began, I became acutely aware of a Presence withinthe chamber - a strongfeeling that what was taking place was being attentively regarded by someoneother than the participants.Since a wedding is essentially illustrative rather than operative, and since Idon’t always have feelings likethis at such times, it implies to me [if the perception were a valid one] thatthe Harrises may have some roleof importance to play in the future. After the wedding the Pipkins and I droveto Santa Barbara for dinner,ritual, and much conversation with Magister Aquino and Priestess Sinclair. Allin all it was such anenjoyable weekend that I felt depressed all day Monday. 656I recounted my own impressions of the visit to Anton LaVey:It is late Sunday afternoon here, and the Pipkins have just departed for LosAngeles with Dale Seago.The three of them arrived here yesterday afternoon, and I took everyone out to anice supper downtown.Then we returned to my home, engaged in some discussion, and performed the“Celebration of Death”ritual. Thereafter we retired to the Sanctum and talked until about 3 AM.Bacon ’n’ eggs à la T.M.C. for all this morning, together with more discussion,centering primarilyaround the new Phase. Both Dale and the Pipkins now have a good workingunderstanding of its basicattitude. I gave more emphasis to the outward workings of the Phase than to theesoteric bases involved,assuming that you would elaborate if and when you choose to do so. But now theyunderstand the new“machinery” with which they will be working, so to speak.Personally I was greatly impressed with both Pipkins. They were a little on thequiet side at first, butthere is substantial intellect inside once you draw it out. The ritual was avery effective method for doingthis. Interesting how Satanic ritual lays personalities bare. Sort of like Room#101 in 1984. It enables themagician to delve beyond and behind the Reichian armor of those present.While I “held forth” last night in the Sanctum, I said comparatively little thismorning, preferring to seewhat subjects Dale, Lilith, and the Pipkins would work over on their own. Thetone was highlysophisticated, and I was quite satisfied. They all appear to have grasped therationale of the new Phasewithout prodding or excessive explanation.This to me is one of the hallmarks of a true Priest or Priestess, and on thatcriterion I think the Pipkinshave come through very well indeed. I understand that they have both sent theirIII° examinations to San656 Letter, L. Dale Seago to “Lana Green”, August 29, IX/1974.- 356 -Francisco, and I hope that the contents of those papers are as impressive as thePipkins themselves. On thebasis of the contact I have had with them - admittedly not much - I wouldendorse them for the III°. 657West-II was now effectively moribund; after two successive cancellations fewwestern Satanists wouldbe likely to respond to a third rallying-cry. Despite the success of West I[which itself had been relocatedtwice before finding a home], the conclave concept in the West proved unable tomatch the success of itsEastern counterpart.While Dale Seago was feeling depressed in Los Angeles, East-VI came offspectacularly and on thewhole effectively in Windsor, Canada. A report on its proceedings was forwardedby Warlocks MichaelMcQuown and Stuart Levine of the Lilith Grotto, and is reproduced as Appendix#112.Warlock DeCecco’s account in his next grotto newsletter was even more succinct:EAST VI - EAST VI - EAST VI - EAST VI - EAST VI - WHAT CAN I SAY? - WHAT CAN ISAY? -WHAT CAN I SAY? - INSTRUCTION - RITUAL - COMEDY - WINE & CHEESE - CARDINAL PUFF-DEBAUCHERY - CHINESE FOOD - STRIKE - SLOW ELEVATORS - MARTINIS - THREE DAWNS -BROTHERHOOD - DISPLAYS - SQUEAKY TOYS - BANQUET - WALKS - COFFEE - IRONINGROBES - PIZZA - TAXIS - DISCUSSIONS - WORKSHOPS - INCENSE - ROOM 830 - THE VLAD-MORE PIZZA - JOKES - STEVE & LYNN’S EXPERTISE - SPAGHETTI - SALMON (from NovaScotia,of course) - PHŒNIX - CUSTOMS-GATES - MOTHER - NEW FRIENDS - BEAUTIFUL WITCHES -GIN - HALLWAYS - CONFERENCE ROOM A - CAMERAS - PBI … all this and more, that youwhowere not there are missing out on. Maybe next year we’ll see more of you.SATANAS VOBISCUM.658Some misgivings of McQuown and Levine were amplified thereafter by Warlock TomHuddleston:As you know, Colleen and I have attended five of the Eastern Conclaves. Eachgathering varied indegree of success and contact, even though many of the “same old Conclave group”were at each. A displayof different Conclave proceedings and ritual styles, I believe, preventsstagnation and promotes new areasof learning and achievement. Each Conclave has maintained a high degree ofvitality, both educationallyand socially.It seems, however, that the magical realization of the overall Conclave functionhas decreased inmomentum. To say merely “the thrill is gone” is quite inaccurate. I think yourexplanation of the increasingawareness of the individuality of Satanists may be nearer to the mark. Thissaddens both of us greatly. Theobjective of a Conclave should not be to determine which members areincompatible. We don’t need aSatanic roller derby team!The East-VI proceedings in Windsor, in our estimation, were executed withdignity and sincerity ofpurpose. The contents of the discussions were informative and appropriate forthe current directions of theChurch of Satan. As for the different style of ritual presentation, I havealready expressed my views onvariety. Variety is the price of life (?). That’s a Christian pun, by the way.659The failure of West-II, combined with the somewhat mixed reaction to East-VI,moved Anton LaVeyto decide that the already-once-postponed International Conclave had better becanceled for good. Myspirits sank when Diane phoned with the news; having corresponded fast andfuriously with StephenHollander concerning its arrangements for the past two years, I knew he wouldreceive the decision with acertain bitterness.To make matters worse, the plans for the International Conclave had now beenpolished to a highgloss. The idea was to have a packaged vacation, not just a meeting in aparticular city. Two chartered657 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, August 18, IX/1974.658 DeCecco, Robert, Straight From Hell #II-5, September 10, IX/1974.659 Letter, Thomas Huddleston to M.A. Aquino, September 16, IX/1974.- 357 -buses were to roll towards Ottawa - one from Los Angeles or San Francisco andone from Washington,D.C. or New York. Each would follow a scenic route, picking up more Satanists enroute, until the twomet in Canada’s capital. At that point the major part of the program would begin[see Appendix #113]. Allof these arrangements had reached the travel-agency stage; all that remained wasthe collection ofregistration fees to set them in motion. Since I had worked with Hollander onthe project from itsinception, it was up to me to break the news to him. I tried to rationalize thedecision as best I could:First of all, the economic recession in the United States that I spoke of in oneof my bulletins earlier thisyear is continuing. Our expectations are that it will be much worse by thesummer of X/1975. Salaries willbe pinched, credit will be tight, and budgets will be managed conservatively.The $150 Conclave fee iscertainly reasonable for such a lavish program, but the high transportationcosts to and from Canada areexpected to deter all members save those living relatively close toToronto/Ottawa. Several of our moreaffluent and dedicated members would make it, of course, but most probably notin sufficient numbers tojustify an International Conclave on the scale we had planned.The second reason is that the Nine have begun to entertain serious doubts aboutthe effectiveness of theentire Conclave concept in something like the Church of Satan. Satanists arestrongly individualistic bydefinition, and we continue to find that they function best in their own spheresof influence. To bring themall together in one lump is to court friction. This was not immediately evidentwhen the first Conclaveswere held, but it has become increasingly more so. Three of our most competentofficials - each a model ofexpertise in his or her own sphere - got their backs up in Washington over amatter of opinion. The samething seems to have happened again at East-VI and with respect to the TorontoConclave. As incredible as itmay seem, we have already begun to receive negative comments concerning theplans for Toronto. Notcentral enough, too expensive, too complicated to enter and leave Canada, whynot this city or that cityinstead [with complete disregard for the fact that alternative suggestions weresolicited over a year ago], etc.There are times when I become quite cold-blooded, and this is one of them. Ifsome of our people areunable to appreciate just how marvelous the Toronto Conclave could be - and thesubstantial amount ofwork already expended to make it so - then I’m damned if I’m going to cajolethem into “tolerating” theConclave and “forcing” themselves to enjoy it. I have too high an opinion ofboth my time and yours. I amretaining all of the documents you’ve sent to date. At some time - hopefully inthe very near future - weshall have a select meeting in Toronto and Ottawa of key Satanists only. It willbe secret and by invitationonly, and it could easily prove of greater consequence than the open Conclavepreviously envisioned.The third reason is that - through a Mandate unexpectedly and suddenly receivedfrom Our Lord Satan -the Church is now to commence a new Phase of its Master Plan. This developmentwill be explained indetail in a Central Grotto bulletin from Reverend Kincaid.Now let’s take a look at East-VI. The comments have come swarming in like a hiveof bees. Somethought it was the cat’s pajamas; some thought it was a horror. Some thought theritual was dignified,profound, and in the highest traditions of Satanism. Some thought it wasunSatanic and more suited to ahippie wedding or one of Guru Maharaj-ji’s flings than a Satanic Conclave. Atleast all were united in praiseof your own efforts as presiding officer. The point, obviously, is not that itwas a good Conclave or a badConclave. The point is that you can’t take Satanists from a variety of differentenvironments and expectthem to agree on anything. If we were a Christian-style church - with afollow-the-leader mentality in thebulk of our membership - it would of course be different.The best thing to do is to encourage Satanists to operate in their own spheresof influence, withcommunication between Satanists being done on an individual and highly-selectivebasis. 660So perished the First International Conclave of the Church of Satan. But noteternally - for in Augustof XIV the Temple of Set finally came together for its Set-I InternationalConclave in Windsor, recallingas it did the ghost of its near-predecessor.Lilith Sinclair’s last speaking engagement as Leader of the Lilith Grotto hadbeen before the PsychicPhenomena Society of New Jersey in May (Appendix #114). Now in September, as sheprepared to depart660 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Stephen Hollander, September 13, IX/1974.- 358 -the Grotto that she had founded and guided for so many years, her last act wasto announce the ordinationof her two principal lieutenants to the Priesthood. 661 In Satan’s Spawn, theGrotto newsletter, she said:I am most pleased to announce the elevation of Michael L. McQuown and Stuart J.Levine of the LilithGrotto to the Priesthood of Mendes. Reverend McQuown and Reverend Levine havebeen with us since theyear VI/1971 and have contributed greatly to the Grotto’s success. We are allextremely proud of them andextend to them our warmest congratulations.As you all know, I shall be relocating to Santa Barbara, California on October2, IX. The years I haveworked with all of you have been most rewarding. While at times it has been along, hard haul, I have hadthe satisfaction of seeing you grow and progress until you are all trulyindividuals, self-aware andindependent. Each of us has learned from the other, and each of us hascontributed to the Grotto in his orher own unique way.As the leadership of the Lilith Grotto passes from my hands to those of ReverendMcQuown, I ask allof you to extend to him and to Reverend Levine the same courtesy, cooperation,and respect that you haveshown to me. I depart secure in the knowledge that all of you shall continue toprogress and to conductyourselves as the gods and goddesses that you are. May the Dark Prince grant allthat you desire, as youwalk the way of the flames! Rege Satanas! Hail, Satan!662The Grotto was sorry to see its sorceress depart. Michael McQuown responded:It is a time of very mixed emotions for me. On one hand I am losing a good anddear friend; on theother I have been accepted into a select and special society and greatlyhonored.Priestess Lilith began the Grotto nearly four years ago with only a member ortwo. At various times theGrotto has grown and diminished in number, but its prestige in the Church ofSatan has steadily increased.It is she who set the standards and gave the Grotto its unique style. Twice ithas changed its location, andwill do so again. In spite of all these changes the Grotto has always goneforward and will, I hope, continueto do so. When Priestess Lilith departs these shores, the work she has done willremain as testimonial to herstrength, wisdom, and courage. She has offered, once she is settled, to send usoccasional editorials andletters which we can all share. In this way she can still be a part of us. 663Lilith’s move to Santa Barbara had been anticipated by her and myself for sometime. Due to reasonsunconnected with the Church of Satan, Janet and I had decided upon a divorce inmid-VIII/1973.Subsequently Lilith and I had begun to discover an empathy between us thatgradually blossomed into adeep and enduring love. Her arrival in Santa Barbara marked the beginning ofwhat was to become adeeply enchanting magical journey for the two of us. Our eventual marriage inXXI/1986 served thus toformalize a union which had long since been recognized by far greater forces inthe Universe.The Occult Superstar of the East wasn’t in the West for long, however, beforeshe began to make hermark there as well. At this point in time I happened to be an officer in the306th Psychological OperationsBattalion, U.S. Army Reserve, which met at the nearly-deserted “upperreservation” of Fort MacArthur inSan Pedro.The 306th was no ordinary Reserve unit. To begin with, psychological operations- or “PSYOP” - isone of the most esoteric concerns of the Army. Few people understand it, andmany mistrust it, since itconjures up visions of the sort of mind-control propaganda made infamous by Dr.Goebbels.To make matters worse, the 306th seemed to attract every mad scientist,character actor, andmiscellaneous weirdo in the greater Los Angeles area. One group of officers,dearly beloved by thebattalion, decked out their office on the post as a medieval chamber, completewith candelabra, wine-661 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lilith Sinclair, September 24, IX/1974.662 Sinclair, Lilith in Satan’s Spawn #III-2, undated, ca. September IX/1974.663 McQuown, Michael in Satan’s Spawn #III-2, undated, ca. September IX/1974.[index-359_1.jpg]- 359 -bottles, sumptuous rugs, and antique oak furniture. They were served wine bynude wenches, whosephotographs appeared charmingly on the walls. Often these gallants, who hadforsaken ordinary U.S.Army uniforms for custom-designed ones of Ruritanian splendor, would conductimpromptu duels withfencing sabres. It was not uncommon for the battalion staff to be holding abriefing for the commander (aWorld War II command bomber pilot) while the clash of steel was heard throughthe window.Then there was a reserved but cheerful lieutenant who all but disappeared behindan oversize fieldjacket and aviator’s mustache - Bruce Bibee. His hobby was bombs, explosives,and implements ofdestruction in general, and he proudly wore the Army’s badge for unexploded bombdisposal on his chest.He would later become an Adept II° of the Temple of Set.The unit’s intelligence officer was indeed a towering presence; his name wasDennis Mann and hestood almost seven feet tall. To confuse people he drove the smallest Fiat made,whose license plate read“GONZO-1” in honor of his hero, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (caricatured as “UncleDuke” in GarryTrudeau’s Doonesbury comic strip). Dennis went on to become a Master of theTemple IV° and memberof the Temple of Set’s Council of Nine.All of which is to say that I felt right at home in the 306th PSYOP Battalion,and it felt equally happyto have someone on the staff to personify its spiritual climate. In early 1974it featured its “unofficial unitchaplain” in its monthly newsletter (Appendix #115).But it didn’t really sit up and bark until Lilith Sinclair came along for aweekend meeting, curious tosee for herself this very odd military phenomenon.- 360 -The 306th operated its own radio station, KPSY, which broadcasted each weekendthroughout the SanPedro neighborhood surrounding Fort MacArthur. At one time KPSY had broadcastedto a wideraudience, but then one of its announcers had indulged his creativity over theair somewhat beyond thelimits of decorum anticipated by the FCC, resulting in the loss of KPSY’slicense.But KPSY was still on the air locally, and now the radio company commanderseized Priestess Sinclairand dragged her into the studio [on the back of a trailer-truck] for aninterview. It is questionable whetherhis purpose wasn’t rather to ogle the black-clad witch, and he wasn’t alone, asthe trailer was packed withPSYOPers. [He later remarked to me that it was the first time he had ever seenhis entire companytogether in one place.]The interview was of course a success, and Lilith was invited into the BattalionCommander’s office toreceive from him the certificate of an Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S.Army - a developmentwhich mildly disgruntled her father and brother, who were Naval Reserveofficers.By October Anton LaVey had decided to approve four more Priesthoods - for Pauland Diane Pipkin,Steve Hollander, and Robert DeCecco.664 Upon hearing the news, DeCecco wrotejointly to Anton andmyself:“The acceleration of man’s development has reached an epic point of change.” (Satanic Rituals, p. #12)My thanks to you will be seen throughout - in future days, places, and deeds.The words have beenwritten, the Order has invited me, and I will respond. You will hear of me, andyou will see me, moving inYour presence. Feel now my presence, as I embrace You.“It is ever through you that all gifts come to us; knowledge and wealth areYours to bestow. Renouncingthe weak and lowly, we place our trust in Thee.” ( Le Messe Noir)665By the end of September, Anton LaVey was ready to officialize “Phase IV” of theChurch of Satan’s“Master Plan”. I doubt that an actual master plan ever existed, but it was asuitably impressive andmysterious oracle to invoke, if nothing else. Anton decided to attribute PhaseIV to the nonexistentCouncil of Nine rather than himself, and the formal announcement was attested toby the equally-ethereal“John M. Kincaid”. Its text is reproduced as Appendix #116.The Phase IV announcement is one of the most interesting and indeed crucialdocuments in the historyof the Church of Satan. It represents a summing-up of Anton LaVey’s feelingstowards the viability of theinstitution he had created, headed, and observed for the previous nine years. Hehad lost none of hisenthusiasm for Satanism, but he had come to the conclusion that the kind ofpeople who joined the Churchof Satan were, by and large, just not mature and trustworthy enough to translatehis theories into practice.But what the Church could not do in fact, as the Ninth Solstice Message implied,it might stillaccomplish in fiction. Its reputation had been made, both by Anton and by themany other Satanists whohad upheld the banner of the Church throughout its history. Now that reputationmight energize a “Satanicmovement” in more sophisticated circles.Dr. Frankenstein’s problem was that, after proving he could create life, he wasstuck with a livemonster. Dr. LaVey’s problem was very much the same; he was stuck with asomewhat inconvenient, butstill very much alive and enthusiastic Church of Satan. Phase IV, therefore, washis means of commencingto cage it, if indeed not ultimately destroy it. First its various Grottos,Regional Agents, and members-at-large needed to be disconnected from one another; then it was a simple matter ofattrition until themembership consisted of only the most passive and docile “underground”Satanists.At first the monster didn’t understand the invitation to enter the cage. To meBill Murray commented:664 Letters, M.A. Aquino to Paul Pipkin, Diane Pipkin, Robert DeCecco, & StephenHollander, October 3, IX/1974.665 Letter, Robert DeCecco to Anton LaVey & M.A. Aquino, October 7, IX/1974.- 361 -Now to “da piece a’resistance”, as an old acquaintance of mine used to say:Reverend Kincaid’sinformational letter dated September 27. I understand it; I think I understandit! It seems to make sense tome:1. A Grotto that becomes too well-established, but which becomes moribund,structured, and bound-upin its own importance - ergo becomes nonproductive - must necessarilyself-destruct. That is why I havealways said that the “Church and chapel” movement, which developed of itselfwithin the organizedChurch, was a healthy development. Healthy in that it was fluid and discourageddogmatism because of thevery nature of the beast. Which harkens back to Dr. LaVey’s initial remarks inthe Satanic Bible.2. I must say that at this time I cannot fathom Central Grotto’s reasoning forthe “no contact” rule, otherthan perhaps - and I am really reaching for this supposition - that it wouldprevent some of the factors whichwere present in the Wayne West nonsense of several years back. If it representsa “stratification”, then Ihave really lost the thread.Sorry about my being so cautious about trying not to sound like a gossipmonger.It is not that mymembership experience has made me overly cautious. It is just that I know how Ifeel about gossip and“shit-disturbers”, and I know the Church’s attitude on this subject as well. Iwas just a bit turned off by acouple of persons last Walpurgis when they made utterances to other members in amanner I felt not to be inkeeping with the dignity of their degrees. That’s all. I suppose it was reallynothing. It certainly didn’t affectme, but it did hurt some others or at least abuse their trust. I will speak ofit no more.I will say I have heard some rather sad secondhand comments about theforthcoming Wolfe biographyof Dr. LaVey. General opinion is that it is poorly researched, poorly written,contains some glaring half-truths, and is “just not up to snuff”. No doubt I will read it. 666Whatever the Central Grotto wanted to hear about Phase IV, Murray’s commentwasn’t it. In factWilliam F. Murray, with his channels of communication throughout the entireChurch, was everythingPhase IV was designed to counteract. From “John M. Kincaid” came an abruptrejoinder to Murray:Over the past three years since your being appointed Regional Agent, we haveobserved no progress onthe regional level. There have been no new members, no observable influence uponthe community, and noindividual progress on the part of members assigned to you which would not haveoccurred without theirassociation with you.Your regional newsletter does not appear to be self-sustaining on a regionallevel, hence should not becategorized as such. All other regional newsletters concern themselves withlocal affairs, with theoccasional exception of a “guest contributor” from out of the area. Theproduction staff is chosen fromregional sources, in accordance with the guidance set forth in both the ClovenHoof and past RegionalAgent memos.In view of the foregoing, the Council of Nine has determined your role asRegional Agentcounterproductive to the direction of self-sufficiency encouraged by the newPhase. As of this date,therefore, you are relieved of your responsibilities as Regional Agent. Yournewsletter may continue if youwish, but as a personal venture rather than as representative of your entireregion’s activities.Perhaps it will help to clarify certain matters in your own mind if we informyou that you guessed rightwhen you postulated in your letter to Magister Aquino that the new Phaserepresents stratification. TheChurch of Satan was never intended to be a democratic organization.May we make a suggestion? Try doing less and producing more. The hamster on awheel is very goodat “keeping busy”, but we all know the nature of the fruits of his labor. 667Upon receiving a copy of this letter from the LaVeys, I was appalled; it wasoverkill. I dashed off anote of my own to Winnemucca with the intent of applying first aid:666 Letter, William Murray to M.A. Aquino, September 30, IX/1974.667 Letter, “John Kincaid” to William Murray, October 14, IX/1974.- 362 -I have just seen a copy of Reverend Kincaid’s October 14th letter to you. In myopinion it containscertain negative connotations that were not intended by the Council. While I amone of the Nine, I was notat the meeting where this decision was reached. The other members of the Councilare aware, however, thatI would have spoken against any change in your status as Regional Agent. 668To Diane LaVey I hastened to explain my action:The thing about the Kincaid letter is that it really wasn’t fair at face value.You can’t jump on aRegional Agent for not recruiting, because we keep telling them that the Churchof Satan does not “recruit”.He is supposed to sit on his haunches until another member contacts him foradvice. This function he hasprobably performed better than many another Agent. At least I have never heardthat he has failed to answera letter!Of course you’re right that his newsletter was not truly intra-regional, but Ithink it has made a positivecontribution to the Church as a whole. It has some good stuff and some cornystuff, but people seem to get akick out of it. I’m sure that, if some Satanist in Murray’s region were to takethe trouble to send him anarticle for the paper, it would get published. Again it shouldn’t be Murray’sresponsibility to shake peopledown for articles.During the past couple of years, Murray has traveled to a number of Conclavesand Grotto affairs,putting out considerably more funds in doing so than most members would spend.He has made trips as faraway as Canada and N.Y.C. Not one person whom he has visited has made theslightest negative commentto me about him. Quite the contrary, he has made friends everywhere. This is notto say that he isn’trecognized as a busybody and a gossip. But everyone knows it and accepts him assuch. I have mentionedhis removal from the Agent’s position to only two people so far - Dale Seago andLilith Sinclair - and theywere both highly dismayed to hear of it.Now to the real reason why I sent Murray my follow-up to the Kincaid letter. Iknow that you just don’tlike Murray because of his officiousness, opportunism, posturing, etc., and Ican understand your desire tohave him out from underfoot. But the Kincaid letter is not going to accomplishthat. Worded as harshly as itis, it will either cause him to cut his throat, or it will fill him with adesire to be revenged upon “those whohave used him for three years only now to kick him off the back of the train”.A Murray who feels that his honor has to be satisfied could cause us moretrouble than DeHaven, West,Solomon, and Chojnicki combined. He corresponds like crazy, and he is onfirst-name terms with almostevery Priest, Priestess, and Agent in the U.S. and Canada. If he were to go on arampage against the Church,it would be years before the damage could be repaired. He would also be capableof dragging in Buckland,Martello, and god knows whom else. Even Sammy Davis, whom he knows after havingworked on hisback-up crew some years ago. I don’t even want to think about it.669As Halloween loomed, I again felt weary of my role as Eliot Ness and recalledwith some nostalgia thefreewheeling days of the Nineveh Grotto in Louisville. Perhaps Lilith and Imight be able to start upsomething like a Grotto in Santa Barbara - nothing as actively flamboyant asLilith or Nineveh, but rathermore along the lines of a Satanic study group. I decided to experiment with thenearby University ofCalifornia, Santa Barbara campus, and accordingly placed the followingadvertisement in its Daily Nexus:The Church of Satan, a non-prophet corporation, is considering an experimentalcollegiate Satanistcircle at U.C.S.B. Interested humans may telephone 682-1357 at midnight. 670The results of this ad are best summarized by the letter I sent to respondents:668 Letter, M.A. Aquino to William Murray, October 18, IX/1974.669 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, October 22, IX/1974.670 Aquino, M.A., Daily Nexus, University of California, Santa Barbara, October10, 1974.- 363 -While we had anticipated a substantial reaction to the Nexus advertisement, theinflux of calls turnedout to be quite overwhelming. In addition to the many serious inquiries, ofcourse, there were the invariablecrank-callers. Among messages in the latter category were prayers, declamations,chuckles & giggles,curses, exclamations (“Far out, man!”, etc.), indignant challenges,“raspberries”, offers of animals forsacrifice (something we don’t do), 8 male and 3 female sexual propositions, 4news-media inquiries, 2mantras, an assortment of magical incantations, and one invitation to a secretrendezvous at HowardJohnson’s.671Ultimately Lilith and I found no persons of the calibre we sought, so weabandoned the experiment. Itsepilogue was a somewhat bewildered story in the Nexus a month later (Appendix#117). But we wereconsoled by the news that Anton LaVey was coming south for a Halloween visit.That visit proved very pleasant for all concerned. Pleased by Mary Every’sarticle on my involvementwith Satanism, Anton agreed to be interviewed by her as well, and the result(Appendix #118) was one ofthe most sophisticated and sympathetic interviews ever published concerning him- and in a newspaperwhich had become a national legend for its conservative objectivity. Indeed Irecall with pleasure thatperhaps the two interviews most revealing of the gentle, thoughtful side ofAnton Szandor LaVey weredone by the newspapers in my own locale at the time - the Louisville Times(Appendix #26) and now theSanta Barbara News-Press.Lilith, Anton, and I attended an old-fashioned costume party on Halloweenevening. I went as a demonsufficiently realistic to bring the party to a momentary halt, Lilith went asherself, which got it goingagain, and Anton Szandor LaVey went as Anton Szandor LaVey.The following day the three of us traveled down the coast to Los Angeles,joining up with Dale Seagofor a Priestly feast at the Long Beach Naval Officers Club, followed by drinksand discussion at the Gateof Spain, an atmospheric nightclub towering high above Santa Monica’s HuntleyHouse Hotel. The nextmorning Anton commented:Slept fine. Upon sober reflection, feel that our “Mid-Working Executive RegionalConclave” held atLong Beach Naval Base Officers Club and Huntley House in Santa Monica was aresounding success! - andshould be shared with our more “concerned” members.“Responsibility to the responsible …” 672The Black Pope headed out into the desert towards Las Vegas, after which hereturned to SanFrancisco and sent the following followup:Now that I’m settled for a bit, I want to thank you for your kindness during theHalloween weekend.You are the most unobtrusive get-up-and-go-to-the-office-er I’ve yetencountered.Speaking of unobtrusive, Tony tailed you and Lilith down Hollywood BoulevardSaturday afternoonbefore I last saw you. Didn’t hear about it ’til the next day!Have eaten lots of Mexican food - even had some waiting for me in Vegas. I feellike a taco.One of the films I worked on, The Second Coming of Svengali, is scheduled forDecember 18 release.Naturally the D.F.’s (Dark Forces) win at the end.Tracked down Satanis before I left for Durango. Budget Films in L.A. lists it intheir rental catalogue.Now I must track down the producer to extract a print that was promised me - in1968.Excuse me. I hear an enchilada calling (good song title). 673671 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Daily Nexus advertisement respondents, October 17,IX/1974.672 Note, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 1, IX/1974.673 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, November 14, IX/1974.- 364 -In November the Church of Satan made another type of media appearance - in theplastic world ofcommercial aviation, as United Airlines’ magazine ran a photo of Anton, togetherwith the followingcapsule:San Francisco is also famous as the headquarters of the international Church ofSatan. An earlydocumentary film called Satanis purportedly showed black-robed membersperforming a Black Mass with anude woman for an altar.But the Church is presently attempting to improve its public image, emphasizingits members’intellectual commitment rather than the more sensationalistic aspects which thepress is so quick to pick up.Taking a position against “pious nonsense”, whether religious, philosophical, orpolitical, their leaderAnton Szandor LaVey proclaims, “Satan is the best friend traditional religionhas ever had, as he’s kept it inbusiness all these years.” 674The Winter Solstice - December 21 - found Lilith and myself back in Los Angelesas guests of ForryAckerman during the annual meeting of the exclusive Pinckard Science FictionSalon at his home. Webumped noses with such notables as animator Ray Harryhausen, author RobertBloch, producer GeorgePal - and a cheerful lady named Edith Eyde, who informed us that she lived alonein her Los Angeleshome - except for an entourage of thirty-one cats!Eyde inquired of me whether I had ever heard of a piece of music called The Hymnto Satan. Indeed Ihad, I responded. It had been composed by Dietrich von Kroeller in Berlin,played in the Sportspalast, andsubsequently adopted by the Church of Satan. When I hummed a few bars, Eydechuckled. She herselfhad composed it in 1939, she avowed, and dragged Forry Ackerman over to verifysame [which he did].She then proceeded to write out the never-before-heard words of the Hymn for meon a piece of scratchpaper produced by the Ackermonster:Hymn to SatanSatan, Prince of DarknessRuler of all evil things,We are your disciples,O most powerful of kings.Teach us all your evil ways,Let us know your blackest arts;You are ever in our souls,You are ever in our hearts.After leaving the Pinckard gathering, Lilith and I drove across Hollywood toDale Seago’s YuggothGrotto, where a gala Black Mass was conducted. Sipping some Goblin Juice madefrom Anton LaVey’sCompleat Witch recipe, I reflected that it had been a very productive year forthe brethren of the Left-HandPath.674 “Does the Medium Have the Message?”, Mainliner magazine, United Airlines,November 1974.[index-365_1.jpg]- 365 -Michael Grumboski (“Shai”), who had begun his Satanic career as Wayne West’sprincipal lieutenantin the Babylon Grotto, had long since become one of the pillars of the Church ofSatan in the midwest. Hehad survived the Babylon disaster only to find himself in the midst of theStygian scandal. Surviving thattoo, he had gone on to reunite the Ohio and Michigan areas as best he could.Douglas Robbins’ Belphegor Grotto, another Babylonian colony, had finallytrailed off intonothingness, but Shai’s own Phœnix Grotto and Tom & Colleen Huddleston’s TyphonGrotto had workedout a loose coalition of Satanists - including Regional Agents such as StephenHollander of Ottawa andArthur Zabrecky of Cleveland - to conduct regular activities, publishnewsletters, sponsor successfulConclaves, and represent the Church very commendably indeed.Shai had ultimately attained the Priesthood, and at his ordination ceremonyduring the East-IIConclave in Louisville in VII/1972 I had presented him with my own III°medallion. His dedicated butmischievous manner had become a Phœnix trademark, and it seemed - finally - thatthe Church of Satancould relax concerning the “cursed” city of Detroit.The East-VI Conclave brought the first ominous signs that such expectationsmight still be premature.Reports trickled back to San Francisco and Santa Barbara to the effect that Shaihad been something otherthan his usual, ebullient self. He had been morose, apparently deeply troubledabout something he seemeddetermined not to discuss. Old friends shook their heads but concluded that itwas none of their business.And then, in June IX, Shai surprised the Central Grotto:Be it known to all concerned that upon this date, June 1st in the Ninth year ofthe Dark Lord’s reign, Iformally request the Council of Nine to be relieved of all duties and pleasuresgranted to the Priesthood III°.Due to an increased concern over greater cooperation and understanding betweenthe various Satanicchurches, I feel that I can no longer discharge my responsibilities fully and inthe best interests of theChurch of Satan. I trust no ill will shall be generated by my actions. Over thepast five years I have come tolove and respect the great many individuals I have had the pleasure of meetingwithin Church circles. Mysincere thanks to Dr. LaVey for all he has taught me and the world about livingand enjoyment of life. 675What had sparked Shai’s sudden concern for other “Satanic churches”? A shorttime earlier JosephDaniels and Clifford Amos, moving away from John DeHaven’s “Church of SatanicBrotherhood”, hadwith ruffles and flourishes announced the formation of the “Ordo TempliSatanas”, in which both of themassumed the degree of Magister. In the Cloven Hoof I referred to such “MexicanGenerals” scornfully:Some of these people are loners who want instant status and/or notoriety. Othersare ex-members of theChurch of Satan whose ambition for advanced degrees exceeded their capability tomeet the standardsnecessary for such degrees. Our general policy on nonaffiliated Satanists isthat they are free to indulge675 Letter, Michael Grumboski to Central Grotto, June 1, IX/1974.- 366 -themselves as long as they do not get underfoot. We recognize no Satanic officesor titles save thoseconferred by our Church. 676Joseph Daniels wasn’t pleased. He promptly prepared a circular and mailed it toall members of theChurch of Satan known to him:Under the title of “Mexican General Department” the Editor of the Cloven Hoofrecently delivered arather fatuous opinion on “nonaffiliated Satanists”, as he so calls them. Thefact of the matter is that theChurch of Satan is not now and never was the governing body of Satanism.Contrary to his implication, nocredentials from that organization are necessary for a person to be a legitimatepriest [yes, even highpriest!], magister, or whatever. On the other hand, as has been proven onseveral occasions, a person’sbearing such credentials is no guarantee of anything.In fact Doctor Anton Szandor LaVey, High Priest and Magus of the Black Order, isvery much aMexican General himself, unless some silver tablet has been found buried on NobHill inscribed with anInfernal mandate. To be sure, the notoriety he has received no doubt helpssupport the burden of his titles.Yet he claimed them when he was just a parvenu appearing in girlie magazines forpublicity! The point isnot that Dr. LaVey does or does not deserve his position. The point is thatultimately he is in the same boatas the rest of us. If the above is true of Dr. LaVey, then I hardly need addthat his creations and grantscannot amount to any more than those of a Mexican General. 677My response was to send out a bulletin to the Priesthood and Regional Agents inwhich I provided abrief account of the events in Stygian which ultimately led to the cancellationof its charter and expulsionof its ringleaders, as discussed at length in Chapter #17, as well as a summaryof subsequent DeHaven/Amos/Daniels doings as recounted in Chapter #26. I indicated my opinion ofDaniels’ “moral indignation”with a drawing of a guillotine in which a chute descended from thechopping-block, accelerating thesevered head towards a set of bowling pins emplaced a short distance away.678Now, considering Shai’s surprise announcement, I could assume only that he hadbeen somewhatsympathetic towards Daniels & Co. I responded to him:Your June 1st letter has just reached me, and it just doesn’t make sense. As thereason for yourresignation, you cite “an increased concern over greater cooperation andunderstanding between the variousSatanic churches”. As far as Satanic interest groups or societies are concerned,you are well aware that ourpolicy is - and always has been - to encourage and assist them whereverpossible. We ask only that theyacknowledge the debt they owe to Dr. LaVey, without whom any open Satanicactivity in this countrywould have remained quite impossible. And obviously we will not endorse any“Satanist” institution whichwe sincerely believe to be fraudulent.If you are speaking about the DeHaven and Daniels groups, you really perplex me.DeHaven used hisGrotto charter as a front for criminal activity, and the bulk of the evidenceand documentation concerningthis was provided by you. Daniels used DeHaven’s newsletter to slander us andinsult our High Priest.Amos was asked to resign because, as an official of the Church of Satan, heparticipated in a curse ritualdirected against you. In spite of all this, we have made every possible effortto avoid interfering with theprivate lives and interests of these and other individuals. We made no commenton DeHaven’s new groupuntil he saw fit to misrepresent us in the public news media.Are you seriously suggesting that we should now get down on our knees and thankthese people forhaving kicked us in the face? Instead of feeling so damned sorry for them, howabout thinking of all thehonest and straightforward members of the Church of Satan whose reputations inthe community and whose676 Aquino, M.A., “Hoofbeats”, Cloven Hoof #VI-1, January/February IX/1974.677 Daniels, Joseph, “Memorandum” in Grimorium Verum #III-1, March IX/1974.678 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Priesthood & Regional Agents, May 24, IX/1974.- 367 -trust in the Church were jeopardized? Are we supposed to forget Daniels’repeated insults to Dr. LaVey justbecause Daniels has now decided that he’s going to forget about them?Now to another point: Damned right we recognize no other “Satanic churches”. Themandate for theChurch of Satan comes directly from the Prince of Darkness himself. If we werenot convinced of this, itwould be hypocritical to call ourselves by the name that we do. It would behypocritical of Anton SzandorLaVey to assume the title of High Priest, to say nothing of Magus V°. It wouldbe hypocritical of me toaccept the position that I hold. Likewise it would be hypocritical of us torecognize any other organizationpurporting to be an authorized church of Our Lord Satan. The theist churches seenothing inconsistent ineach proclaiming to have “the true word” while at the same time endorsing allthe competition. We do. Shai,the Church of Satan is not a game. If it were, I for one would have nothing todo with it. 679Diane LaVey commented to me shortly thereafter:We think you gave a fine, unemotional account of the Michigan/Ohio/Louisvillesituation in your recentletter to Priests and Agents. Also your comment to Shai that “the Church ofSatan is not a game” holds acertain ominousness. In general the tenor of your memoranda has been carefully(seemingly casually)instructive along the lines Anton has in mind. 680While waiting for Shai’s reply, I queried Arthur Zabrecky, who responded:Your letter concerning Rev. Grumboski reached me today, and I was completelytaken by surprise, tosay the least. I contacted Warlock Huddleston and was told by him that Shai isin Mount Vernon visitingwith him and Colleen. From what Tom told me, he didn’t let on to Shai that heknew anything about thecircumstances of his resignation. Shai indicated to him that this was merely aleave of absence for about ayear, as the pressures of his father’s illness and his own busy workload havebeen building up on him.If I can be of any assistance in this matter, please let me know, as my time andexpense couldn’t be toogreat to ensure that things are well with Shai. My wife and I both feel close tohim, as he has visited here inin Cleveland several times. 681Tom Huddleston’s comments arrived a few days later:Hopefully I can shed some light on the matter. On June 1, the date of hisretirement notice, Shai calledColleen and myself from Detroit to inform us of his decision. Among his reasonsfor resignation was “anincreased concern over greater cooperation and understanding between the variousSatanic churches”. Hefurther explained this as a desire to work with some of the other competentSatanic groups in and aroundthe Detroit area. None of these groups, according to Shai, are even remotelyaffiliated with DeHaven’sbunch. One group he mentioned is headed by former Church of Satan member DouglasRobbins.As was the case with your initial response to Shai’s announcement, I nearly hitthe ceiling, for Shai andI have been very close friends and fellow Satanists since our meeting during theStygian crisis. I tooexpected pressure from an organization or individuals as his real reason fortaking leave. But at no timeduring our conversation was this evident.His main reason was a desire to temporarily relieve himself of theresponsibilities and demands of thePriesthood, to “allow some time for himself”. He has mentioned this desire to mebefore in a casual manner,and I do believe it to be the real reason for his retirement.Shai has assured me that, as always, he still maintains the highest respect forDr. LaVey and the Churchof Satan, and that he hopes to return to Church activities in about a year. BothColleen and I are saddened679 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael Grumboski, June 5, IX/1974.680 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 8, IX/1974.681 Letter, Arthur Zabrecky to M.A. Aquino, June 8, IX/1974.- 368 -by his decision, yet we are confident that he has chosen retirement in the bestinterests of his personal lifestyle, and that his decision was not influenced by threat, financial damage, orcoercion. 682And then there was Shai’s own answer to my inquiry:No, I am not under any duress in my decision. In a former exchange we discussedthe duties of aSatanic Priest, and at the head of the list was his primary concern for himself.That’s my primary goal now.The baby-sitting and other mundane tasks of a Grotto Leader have taken theirtoll upon my love and respectfor the Church and its ideals. It has come time for a vacation. I am currentlytaking a night course and wishto devote as much time as I can to it. I have invited the Phœnix membership tojoin me once a month forritual and discussion, but I no longer desire to serve as Regional Agent. Theload of full-time work, part-time education, and full-time Church office simply takes too much out of mylife. My increased concern forintra-Satanism rivalry remains. We stated that, unlike the Wiccan and Christiangroups, we would notengage in backbiting and mudslinging. Yet in many cases we have. Of course youmust defend yourself ifsomeone attacks you, but in some of our defenses I feel we have gone overboard.With regard to Stygianand DeHaven, what I reported was, to the best of my ability, correct and just.683This seemed reasonable enough; Shai needed a vacation. He had certainly earnedit! But why theresignation of his Priesthood? And what if anything lay behind this suddenconcern for non-Church ofSatan groups? An ominous answer arrived from, of all places, the Lilith Grotto.Stuart Levine, the Grotto’schief information scrounger, had laid his hands upon the latest issue of thenewsletter of the NationalRenaissance Party, a neo-Nazi outfit run by a middle-aged New Yorker named JamesH. Madole. In thenewsletter Madole announced:Seth Kliphoth, the N.R.P. organizer for the state of Michigan, attended agathering of the OdinistMovement in Toronto, Canada on March 23rd, at which time he skillfully expoundedthe N.R.P. philosophyto those in attendance.Mr. Kliphoth was accompanied by Ronald Slote and Dennis Pilat of the Americansfor Western UnityMovement, which is based in Michigan. Other speakers at the Odinist gatheringwere Paul Hartman ofCanada’s Western Guard Party and a young N.S.W.P.P. (American Nazi Party) manfrom New York City.The Western Guard Party has been making headlines in Toronto by virtue of itsbloody street battles withMaoist elements in that Canadian city.Mr. Kliphoth, Catherine Holleran, Rev. Blackshire, and several devoted studentsof occult philosophywho are Michigan supporters of the N.R.P., have formed the Order of the BlackRam to celebrate theancient religious rites of the Aryan Race.On March 21st (the Spring Equinox) members of the N.R.P. and friendly occultistsgathered tocelebrate this ancient and revered ceremony. We hope to have pictures fromMichigan for our next issuewhich should demonstrate the sincerity of our followers in breaking away fromall Semitic religiouscustoms as well as their intent to revive the Sacred Rites of our Aryanforefathers by word and deed. 684“Reverend Blackshire”, said Levine, was one of Shai’s aliases. A few days laterfurther disturbingnews arrived from Zabrecky:Last August Shai informed my wife and me that he had started another group.After seeing the card(“The Shrine of the Little Mother”), we kind of tried to laugh it off as a joke.But from Shai’s reaction wecould tell that it was not a joke to him; it was in fact very serious. He showedme an ad in Fate magazine682 Letter, Thomas Huddleston to M.A. Aquino, June 15, IX/1974.683 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, June 16, IX/1974.684 Madole, James H., National Renaissance Bulletin, March/April 1974.- 369 -from the “Brotherhood of Peace and Tranquility” that offered for $3 a charter inany given area usingwhatever name the person submitting the required fee desired. This outfit isfrom somewhere in California.I might add that “Reverend Blackshire” is the same name that Shai used here inCleveland when weappeared on WERE radio last year. Also, when my wife and I visited Shai lastAugust for what was to be aSatanic wedding ceremony, I was caught completely off-guard when I found outthat Shai had invited DougRobbins and a half-dozen of his members to what was to have been a Church ofSatan activity. Shai alsorelayed to us that he had attended several rituals with Robbins and his groupwhere blood sacrifice had beenused. This was in the form of a chicken whose feathers were still on his robe.685The “Shrine of the Little Mother” and the “Order of the Black Ram” were two“Satanic” groups listedby Joseph Daniels in his Grimorium Verum newsletter. In the August 1974 issueDaniels had summarizedthe Order of the Black Ram’s brochure:The O.B.R. is structured along traditional occult lines, having “five degreeswithin the Order proper,ranging from Practitioner (I°) to Grand Magister and High Priestess of theOrder, sole holders of the V°”.To be sure, the existence of two persons holding the ultimate degree is somewhatunusual. For those whoare not ready for active membership, there is the possibility of associatemembership, which “entitles one toreceive a membership card, pentagram, and the monthly publication”.The following is put forward as the organizational objectives of the O.B.R.: 1-To uplift our people tothe knowledge of their own godhead. 2- To build an elite corps of mastermagicians. 3- To celebrate allSatanic holidays at their proper time. 4- To teach what we can: astralprojection, geomancy, Tarot,conjuration & evocation, construction of the tools of the Art, etc. 5- To livein harmony with all thingsnatural, to let our life-style be one of tribal community, and to foster thetribal attitude among our brethren.It should be noted that, in this brochure at least, the O.B.R. strongly supportsthe viewpoint of Dr.Anton LaVey. Indeed they go so far as to say that the Satanic Bible is “theforemost authority on Satanicphilosophy”. They add, however, that “a member of the Order, althoughrecognizing the basic spiritualimpetus of the Satanic Bible, must carry it even further than that”. 686“Harmony with all things natural” didn’t square with chicken sacrifice, nor didthe rest of Daniels’description sound as foreboding as Madole’s. Added to this was my own convictionthat Shai wasessentially a person of integrity. I couldn’t conceive of his involvement withsomething disreputable tohim. The only thing to do, I decided, was nothing - at least until the situationbecame clearer. And, sinceShai had resigned the Priesthood and reassumed the II°, his personal life wasless the Church of Satan’sconcern than it would have been had he remained our ordained official.The surprises were not yet at an end. Anton LaVey, it seems, was no stranger tothe NationalRenaissance Party, as he related to me:The N.R.P., headed by Madole, is composed largely of acned, bucolic typestransplanted to New York.They spend their time getting jeered at in street demonstrations. Yes, the Nazisdid it too, but they had afresh approach. Nowadays, however, swastikas sell books and movies but notsupermarket shoppers. Iknow Madole personally and have been to N.R.P. headquarters. Even have card.They would do anything for us. So would Klan, for that matter. I do not endorseeither, butacknowledge camaraderie from any source.Madole is actually a nice chap who is doing his thing. No need to fret overHell’s Angels types. Theywill come in handy one day, whether they be American Nazi Party or JewishDefense League. 687I responded:685 Letter, Arthur Zabrecky to M.A. Aquino, July 9, IX/1974.686 Daniels, Joseph, “Order of the Black Ram”, Grimorium Verum, August IX/1974.687 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 24, IX/1974.- 370 -Lilith Sinclair has given me a detailed rundown on her past contacts with theN.R.P. Evidently Madoleinvited her and her chief assistants to one of his meetings some time ago.Lilith said she was thoroughly disgusted with the type of persons present - thatthey were all peoplewho had been in and out of jail for petty crimes, and that there were only twopersons who could possiblybe classed as “intellectuals”. The meeting was held at Madole’s house, which shesaid was practicallyoverflowing with Baphomet emblems.This isn’t much help to us, but I guess there isn’t much we can do about it. 688The least that I could do was to say something to our field officials in thearea. I prepared a fact sheetfor Sinclair, the Huddlestons, Zabrecky, and Hollander in which I said:According to Satanic criteria, the importance of Nazi Germany is that itsucceeded in touching the verycore of human behavioral motivation factors. In short, Adolf Hitler knew whatreally makes people tick, and"},{"pageContent":"he formed a political party designed to make those desires legitimate andrespectable in German society. Asyou know from the Satanic Bible, people are motivated basically by crude andbestial emotions - greed,lust, hatred, envy of others’ success, desire for power, desire for recognition,etc. Civilization has repressedsuch anarchic emotions in order that people may live together with a certainamount of peace. When onedeliberately unleashes those emotions, consequently, there is going to be a bitof unpleasantness - war,domestic purges, or the like.The importance of Adolf Hitler is not that he preached the base motivations ofhumanity. He issignificant rather because, once he had released them, he succeeded incontrolling them on a national scale.A lesser man would have become unnerved by the unprecedented concentration ofpower in his hands, orwould have been weakened by power cliques. The strain on Hitler was evident, andmore than anything elseit probably presaged a relatively quick decline and death for him.The odds against the Nazis seizing total control of Germany, to say nothing ofconquering practically allof Europe in less than three years, were staggering. They were overcome both byluck and by the naturalappeal of the emotions to which Hitler was appealing. Until the closing days ofthe war, Hitler wasn’t justmildly popular in Germany; he was wildly so.As for the rest of the world, struggling to extricate itself from the depths ofthe Great Depression, itcouldn’t help viewing Germany’s phenomenal economic recovery with awe, if notoutright admiration.Nazi Germany seemed to have ten times the energy of any other country, and noone could understand why.The keys are there for those who can read them. They are spelled out inextraordinary detail in the mostobvious place: Mein Kampf. It is in vogue today to say that Mein Kampf isboring, disorganized, illogical,and unreadable. This is true - for minds conditioned to the platitudes ofegalitarianism. A first-graderwouldn’t get very far with a textbook on atomic physics either.Mein Kampf is a political Satanic Bible. For control of mass movements of humanbeings, it is far moreimportant than anything ever written by Jefferson, Locke, Marx, Lenin, orKissinger. Volume II, whichdeals with political theory, is more useful than Volume I, which is more of ahistory of the Nazi Party’searly years.When you read Mein Kampf as a political textbook, however, you must mentallyeliminate thedependence upon anti-Semitism which pops up now and then. This was a personalquirk of Hitler’s, whichlater became a convenient scapegoat for German frustration. It is essentiallyunimportant to the main pointsof Mein Kampf.Today’s legacy of Nazi Germany is one of horror and loathing, primarily becauseof Auschwitz and theother extermination camps. Anything of a positive nature accomplished by theNazis is instantly submergedby comparison. Around the entire world it is taboo to even mention the Nazisfavorably, to say nothing ofmaking a pro-Nazi motion picture or writing a pro-Nazi book. This taboo is sopowerful that it is one of thefew things upon which the communists and the capitalists agree. Study of NaziGermany is sanctioned onlyif one dutifully proceeds on the precept that it was a nightmare. In terms ofthe extermination camps, ofcourse, it was.688 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, July 1, IX/1974.- 371 -We are fortunate that the Auschwitz taboo prevents people from looking tooclosely at the rest of NaziGermany, or from experimenting with any of its regular governmental doctrines.Because they work. Theyare the essence of true political power. Anti-Semitism is irrelevant to them.When analyzing the history of Nazi Germany, the anti-Semitism cannot be ignored.When applying thepolitical principles of Mein Kampf to present and future situations, it must be.It is also necessary to note that the specifics of Mein Kampf were keyed to thespecifics of Germannational traditions and current problems. To ape the Nazis’ approach under othercircumstances would beuseless. A political solution must be tailor-made to the political environmentat hand.Now you may understand why all avowed neo-Nazi groups are pariahs in the eyes ofthe Church ofSatan. First, they know nothing at all about the true keys of power employed byHitler. Instead they glorifythe anti-Semitism and the more ostentatious attributes of Nazi Germany whichhave been glamorized byHollywood. Secondly they openly champion Nazi Germany by name, settingthemselves up publiclyagainst the Auschwitz taboo. Thirdly, they propose 1930-German solutions to1970-American problems.In summary, the neo-Nazi groups have not only ensured their impotence - becauseno realistic politicianor interest group will come near them - but they have also ensured their promptdestruction upon theslightest possible excuse. They have been ignored so far only because of theirsmall numbers and the factthat most people regard them as refugees from the loony-bin. It is ironicallytrue that a right-wing backlashin the United States - which is what the neo-Nazis are hoping for - would wipethem out first.If an American Führer does appear, he won’t be wearing a uniform with a swastikaarmband. He willwear a business suit, and he will be calling popular attention to the patrioticvirtues of 1776. 689Anton LaVey’s comments on the same subject arrived a few days later, in a letterto me which, uponreflection concerning the volatility of its contents, he had marked “SECRET”:Your memo re Shai and Madole was first-rate and explained things well. Yourletter to Shai echoed mysentiments: that we owe other groups absolutely nothing, and that there is noneed to establish “greaterunderstanding” with those who have either ignored or maligned us.I am pleased, however, with our enemies, imitators, and rejects for drawing offthose within our rankswho are unworthy, unstable, or otherwise expendable. They are performing thattime-consuming andunpleasant task for us and are isolating themselves, whereby they are easilymonitored. A deviant groupmanifests its plans and actions far more obviously than does a single deviantwithin an ordered structure.If Shai wishes to dally with other factions, he is free to do so, as you statedin your letter relieving himof the Priesthood. I like Shai and wish him well, but I cannot help ponderinghis possible shortsightedness,especially regarding the Nazi ramification.Your analysis of the relative merits of National Socialism and the lack ofunderstanding of same by theAmerican neo-Nazi types is of course accurate. The N.R.P. is enamored with theChurch of Satan. Theirracist ideals are also worn on their sleeves and, I believe, are as removable astheir armbands.Brazilian and Argentinean bandits have crosses, stars of David, and any othersymbol that appeals tothem embroidered on their clothes in profusion, yet are as irreligious a casteof brigands as you’ll find.Mexican-American pachucos and teen hoodlums of the forties and fifties hadtattooed crosses with raysemerging adorning the space between thumb and forefinger, yet never entered achurch and eschewedChristian ethics.What I’m trying to say is that symbolism and symbolism alone supplied theiridentity. That’s the way itis with most outlaw groups. There are only two ingredients necessary for theirexistence: a symbol and ascapegoat.The N.R.P. already has the swastika, but obviously is drawn to our sigil. Theyhave the “Jews andNiggers”, but if properly propagandized could transfer their wrath to ourenemies. How? Through just suchextensions of propaganda as Occult Reich which have emerged from the SatanicRituals. A prognosis fromone of their minds, albeit simplistic:689 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Thomas & Colleen Huddleston, Arthur Zabrecky, StephenHollander, & Lilith Sinclair, July 1, IX/1974.- 372 -“We love the Nazis. Therefore we love their symbols. We hate their enemies.Their enemies were Jews.Everybody thinks the Nazis are bad, like devils. The Church of Satan is supposedto be bad too. But LaVeynever says bad things about the Nazis in his books. Neither do Hell’s Angels saybad things about the Nazis.The C/S must be O.K., like the Hell’s Angels. The colors are similar. TheAngels, the Nazis, and the C/S.All together. Even the Klan. Night Riders all. Now the enemy is the weakling.All my life I’ve been the weakling, but with my swastika I’m strong. My Satanicamulet gives mepower. I’m not a misfit anymore, with pimples and a heart murmur and flat feet.What does it matteranymore that I can’t play baseball or don’t spell too good? So what if I can’tget a girl - I got my armband.If some big-nosed Jew doesn’t like it, we’ll mash him. Same goes for the coons.They want to take over theWhite Man’s world.Maybe we could get the C/S to help us defeat the kikes and niggers so Americacan be pure again.What’s that you say? The real enemy is organized religion? All those solid whitepeople are the ones whomake the most jokes about us? The C/S is the strongest force who likes the Nazisand would let us keep ourswastikas, but their worst enemies are not the niggers and kikes? Their worstenemies are the ‘pure’ whiteswho never had to be outcasts like us?You mean the Jew thing was just a ritual with the Nazis? Yeah, I read where theNazis hated theChristians too but couldn’t let it be known. That they were really Satanists.Shit - we ought to concentrate on the enemies of Satanism … wipe them out. Thenswastikas can fly allover. You say the Baphomet is pretty much the same thing? Sure, I’ll keep itsecret. Yeah, I understand: weonly use the swastika in super-secret rites, like in the Satanic Rituals …”You see, we are dealing with intelligence levels on which imagery and ideals areeasily interchangeable.I wish I had known of Lilith’s visit to N.R.P. headquarters and of theirsubsequent attempts at alliance in“The Magician”. If Lilith couldn’t have propagandized them properly, then Icould have, through theirleaders. I’ve done it with them in part already. All it takes is a littleknowledge of metapolitics, generalsemantics, and twentieth-century history.As it stands, there is only a handful of them. But if they were to revamp theirapproach, their rankswould grow. 690Consider one of James Madole’s letters to Stuart Levine in light of Anton’sobservations:Since Mrs. Sinclair is still in New York City, I wonder if you would be goodenough to have her phoneme any evening. It would be appreciated if you would do so likewise, as I amtrying to find a small group ofpeople who could utilize their services in breaking some of our NRP officers andmen into the moreadvanced concepts of occult philosophy.Naturally I have my own methods, since not all facets of occult philosophy areconsonant with the typeof mentality we are trying to nurture. And I would discuss these methods withany small team of people thateither you or Mrs. Sinclair could recommend and introduce me to. This is what Ihad in mind when Isuggested a meeting with Ronald Barrett, since he would have considerablecontacts through his shop. 691Here there was a humorous detour. Upon comparing Madole’s material to that ofhistorical Nazism, Icouldn’t help thinking how sorry it looked. The Church of Satan could certainlyhave put more zip into it,had we been at all politically inclined. 1974, as recounted in Chapter #30, wasa political low-point for theUnited States, being the time of Watergate. Disgust with the system was rampant.I drew up a parody of the Great Seal of the United States: The eagle wasreplaced by a bat. Instead ofarrows and olive branches, the bat’s claws clutched a trident and an invertedcross. The constellation ofstars was replaced with a pentagram, surrounded with “National Satanist Devil’sAdvocate Party” (a playon the “NSDAP” initials of the old German Nazi party). Under this blasphemouscreation I dashed off afew paragraphs of soapbox sentiments:690 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, July 5, IX/1974.691 Letter, James Madole to Stuart Levine, September 17, 1974.- 373 -The United States of America, long the bastion of moral strength, nationalintegrity, and economicgrowth through honest work, has entered a period of cancerous decline. If notarrested in time, this processwill destroy the country and the stability which it has maintained throughoutthe entire world.You have seen your personal freedom eroded through massive, bloated,interlocking bureaucracies inlocal, state, and national government. You have seen once-vital politicalparties become pathetic farcescaught up in endless duels of meaningless rhetoric. You have seen the fruit ofyour labor taxed from you - orsystematically destroyed through government-sustained inflation …The National Satanist Devil’s Advocate Party is so called because it championshuman values which areheld in contempt by decadent America. It is also so called because it opposesthe doctrines of organizedChristianity which have made weakness a virtue, strength a vice, and unequalachievement a crime. Theparty is affiliated with the Church of Satan, which pursues similar goalsthrough nonpolitical means. 692I ran off only a couple of copies of this Quixotic creation, one of which Iforwarded to Anton andDiane LaVey. Anton’s response arrived shortly thereafter:N S D A PHerr Politische Leiter Michael A. AquinoAussendienstelle Santa BarbaraKalifornia, Nordamerika.Dear “Mike”:You must be joking, ha ha, but of course when you made mention to my Frauregarding politischePartei. How gets by you such an cuckoo ideal I have a trouble to fathom. You, aswell as myself know thatsuchkind of thinking is nonsense of the first Wasser. My friend, when der Tagcomes, then perhaps weentertain a thought or perhaps two thoughts. Until then, it is of the utmostimportance to put aside thismadness.Of course and most reasonably, we will continue in the development of our mostneeded functions:Abwehrpolizei, sites for future Konzentrationslagen, and but of course a finelyappointed Salon Kitty suchas Heydrich had in Berlin for the joy of senior officers.I might add, as matter of fact I will add to this the extreme impotance ofelimination of all non-Satanistsby humane means. I have some new and worthy experiments in the rear end of mymind in which instancemany non-Satanist “volunteers” will be useful. So much for sonderbehandling.At any rates, you are possessed of a grand imagination when you make asuggestion of politische Partei.I have bet your Fraulein in Sommerland would have ein good belly laugh if shecould hear of suchridiculousness. We are a peaceful Volk, wanting only that the Welt bow to ourdomination. If the goodpeoples want us to provide Politik for them, they will ask. In the means whilewe let them hit each other andsteal purses and get rapped in parks. Maybe after some time they will ask us andthen we can providepolitische solution. Until then, please my friend und Brüder, excuse mytypewriting [my Sekretär is tiedup], and keep a cold head concerning politische Partei.Ewiges Satan,Anton Szandor LaVeySatanische Reichsführer693As it turned out, Michael Grumboski’s fling with the Order of the Black Ramended innocuouslyenough in December of 1974, when another surprise communiqué arrived from him:I am agreeable to returning to active Church involvement. After reviewing (anice term meaning“talking to myself”) possible areas of research for the Church, I have selectedthese: (a) the use of microfilmfor storage of Hoof and other important Church-related papers, (b) donation ofCobol programming to the692 Aquino, M.A., “NSDAP” circular, September IX/1974.693 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 24, IX/1974.- 374 -Church, (c) a technical newsletter with just a little offbeat Polish humor tokeep me entertained, (d) myassistance with any problems or pressure-points in my region, and (e) opening ofthe “Finestkind Grotto &Dry Cleaners” [income to cover local expenses, you know]. 694It seemed that Shai had come safely through the Valley of the Shadow of Death,and that there werenot to be any further problems with neo-Nazism.But we hadn’t seen the last of the Order of the Black Ram. The head ram, who hadnow changed hisstage name from “Seth Kliphoth” to “Seth Typhon”, was, unknown to me at thetime, a Church of Satan I°member named John T. Amend. In December 1974 he sent a selection of hisnewsletters and pamphlets toAnton LaVey, who asked John Ferro to reply on his behalf:Reverend Seth TyphonOrdo Caperorum NigraDear Reverend Typhon:Thank you for the material you sent concerning the Order of the Black Ram. Itseems that you haveinitiated the sort of independent yet cooperative posture which we both advocateand encourage. Dr. LaVey,who has read the newsletters and your correspondence, has expressed his pleasureat the recognition youhave shown him and joins us in wishing you success in your endeavors.The structure of our organization encompasses varied segments in and of itself.It is not a “catholic”attitude which precludes additional official affiliation with other Satanicgroups. It is in part that we haveour hands full tending to our own. We hold any individual or group whichfavorably recognizes AntonLaVey and the Church of Satan in automatic alliance with us. It’s as simple asthat.It may surprise [and please] you to know that there are scores of bothself-admitted and de facto Satanicgroups now operating, each within its own peer level and social climate. Theserange from outlawmotorcycle clubs to academic fraternities. Each in its own way is essential toour common goals. When oneobserves the perennial friction encountered in non-Satanic occult groups, weSatanists can take pride in thecohesiveness we have maintained as a movement.The reason should be apparent. Satanism in its contemporary form makes enoughsense so as toeliminate an opportunity for vast differences of opinion between groups orfactions of Satanists.It is the Satanic tenet of “doing one’s own thing” that minimizes rivalriesprevalent in otherphilosophical and religious persuasions. Though personal methods of Satanicexpression vary, vastdeviation from the groundwork laid by the Satanic Bible can only result infoolishness, i.e. hyper-intellectual abstraction at one extreme and fundamentalist Christian-inspiredantics on the other. Thusunqualified would-be Satanists remove themselves by the unsoundness of theiracts.You have expressed this in the Liber Venifica, a well-written and put-togetherpublication, for which wehave enclosed our $5 check for a subscription.In summation, we admire your group as a separate entity, in accord with theindividualistic premises ofSatanism. Yet we consider a council of Satanic groups to be a dilution ofpotential strength, for reasonswhich we have empirically observed. Let us be bound by mutual ideas and goals,not by paper andinstitutionalism, and we shall emerge victorious.Rege Satanas!John A. FerroMagister Caverni IV°695I was surprised and incensed. Never before had the Church of Satan recognizedany “Satanicpriesthood” other than its own as legitimate, and indeed this policy had beenreaffirmed in the ClovenHoof as recounted earlier in this chapter. Nevertheless I could hardly embarrassFerro - or overrule him,694 Letter, Michael Grumboski to M.A. Aquino, December 31, IX/1974.695 Letter, John Ferro to Seth Typhon, January 7, X/1975.- 375 -since it was evident that he was speaking for Anton LaVey himself. I added aletter of my own to “SethTyphon” in which I reluctantly employed the same “Reverend” which Ferro hadused:Dear Reverend Typhon:Our San Francisco office has briefed me on your letter and enclosures to Dr.LaVey. On the whole I amin agreement with Magister Ferro’s comments. At the same time I would appreciatebeing able to put aquestion to you:It always pricks my curiosity when I hear of an individual who, while professingto endorse the SatanicBible, elects to form a new organization instead of seeking affiliation with theChurch of Satan. Sometimesthis indicates that an unfavorable distinction is being drawn between thedoctrine and the organizationwhich was established to embody that doctrine. On other occasions - particularlywhen exalted titlesmanifest themselves - the person may simply have a higher opinion of himselfthan he suspects the Churchof Satan will endorse. Financial motives may be involved as well.There are no statements in your doctrinal papers that are at odds with thestandards of the Church ofSatan, so why have you felt it necessary to form the O.B.R.? Please be candid.You may help us correctsome shortcoming in the local profile of the Church, or we may clarify somemisunderstanding on yourpart. 696I never heard from “Rev. Typhon”, so I assume he got the message. Indeed I neverrealized that, allthis time, he was a Satanist (I°) in the Church of Satan and was probablygetting a good chuckle out of hisquasi-III° recognition.John Ferro, who is no fool, also got the message. When the LaVeys told me thathe had been angeredby my action, I decided I’d better try to explain to him just why I took it:It is true that most of our national membership first sought out the Churchbecause of the image andreputation which Anton Szandor LaVey established for it. But those who havebecome Grotto Leaders,Agents, and finally III° officials found it necessary to take the bit in theirteeth. In San Francisco the Churchof Satan is Anton LaVey. In Michigan, Ontario, New York, or Massachusetts theChurch of Satan consists ofthe concepts of Anton LaVey.To you and me Anton LaVey is a personality. We are motivated by the sheer forceof that personality,and we are inclined to regard the organization as primarily a reflection of thatpersonality.But most of our “field” Priests and Priestesses rose to their present positionswithout having had much -if any - exposure to that personality. To them Anton LaVey is an almost symbolicfigure, a sort of demigod.In their day-to-day work on a local or regional basis, they are not motivated bypersonal contact withhim, any more than Catholics in Santa Barbara are motivated by friendship withPope Paul. Our nationwideSatanists receive their reinforcement and motivation from the local and regionalgroups they have nurtured,the friendships they have made, and - and this is extremely important - theirsense of legitimacy.Members of the Church of Satan - and especially those who have attained the III°- take extraordinarypride in believing that this is the Church of Satan, bearing the authority ofthe Devil himself - and thatAnton LaVey is not just “a” high priest, but the High Priest of the Devil.They are fierce defenders of the Priesthood which they hold, precisely becausethey believe it to begenuine.The current generation of Satanic Priests and Priestesses is not one whichvanishes into the shadows orhides behind Anton LaVey’s coattails when things get tough. These are people whohave withstoodconsiderable abuse from critics, suffered vandalism, been fired from jobs, beenlaughed at or sneered at, hadtheir families threatened, and been ostracized by their own kin. They have stoodlike rocks in spite of this.They have built up local groups from nothing, won local acceptance and evenapproval for the Church, andalmost never complained of the difficulty of the job. They are driven by an idea- and by their belief in thelegitimacy of the organization which is the embodiment of that idea.696 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Seth Typhon, January 14, X/1975.- 376 -Your letter to Seth Typhon could very well be a hammer-blow against that senseof legitimacy. Why?Because, for the first time, a Magister Templi of the Church of Satan has usedthe title of “Reverend” whenaddressing a self-proclaimed Satanic priest.Far from lessening the impact of your letter, my follow-up reinforced it: I usedthat same title despitemy distaste, in order to go on record as supporting you. We stand or falltogether. Yet the body of my lettertells Seth Typhon that we regard his use of that title as open to question. Thatwas as far as I could gowithout explicitly contradicting a fellow IV° official - particularly one whowas speaking on behalf of theHigh Priest.Four years of instability in the Michigan area have left our membership there inpretty much of ashambles. Satanists there have seen official after official turn sour. FiveGrottos have come apart at theseams, including the one I built in Louisville. It is only just now, with theordination of Stephen Hollanderin Ottawa, that I believe we have the strong and effective resident official weso badly need.So what is Steve Hollander, who is now trying to reunite what is left of theChurch of Satan in the GreatLakes area, supposed to think when this Seth Typhon jerk struts up waving yourletter of praise and officialrecognition? I’ll tell you: He’ll think the rug has been yanked right out fromunder him.Nor will it end there. Seth has been in touch with at least four or five otherpseudo-Satanic outfits, andyou can bet your socks he’ll waste little time in trumpeting his endorsement bythe Church of Satan. Worseyet, as Michigan N.R.P. chief, Seth is in touch with James Madole of New YorkCity, the N.R.P. “Führer”, acreep whom Priestess Sinclair, Reverend McQuown, and Reverend Levine have beenfending off for years.There is nothing wrong with the ideals expressed in paragraph #4 of your letter.But the Midwest is notSan Francisco. Out there there are “vast differences of opinion between groupsor factions of Satanists”.Here we return to the issue of legitimacy. Until now we have been representingthe Church of Satan asthe only legitimate Satanic religious organization, assuming its mandatedirectly from the Devil. If we arenow to abandon this stance and become just one of many equally-legitimateoptions, then the most powerfulmotivating force for our field officials will be stripped from them. And AntonLaVey will cease to be theHigh Priest and will become just a high priest. 697Ferro replied:Rest assured, I have taken no personal offense, and I do not doubt your regardfor me. We are verydifferent individuals, which fact we have long acknowledged, and in whichdiversity we rightly takesatisfaction. It is inevitable that we should approach issues from decidedlydifferent vantage points. I thinkit best that we let the matter rest lest we dissipate any further effort andpsychic energy in its pursuit. 698The shortness of this note, so markedly different from the long, chummycorrespondence we had beenexchanging over the past years, should have told me more than its contents. Fromhis perspective, JohnFerro had seen only that, for the first time in years, he had stretched out hishand to influence events in the“field” Church of Satan - only to have it cuffed back by Michael Aquino. Was Iin effect saying to him thathe’d need to toe my line rather than Anton’s in dealing with the “field”? DidAnton LaVey begin towonder about this as well?At the time this didn’t occur to me. I was genuinely unhappy and embarrassedthat I had hurt thefeelings of a friend, but felt that I had had to do so for the sake of thefuture of the non-San FranciscoChurch of Satan. So I took John Ferro’s acceptance of my apology at face value.He and I would not haveoccasion to correspond again prior to the final crisis of 1975.697 Letter, M.A. Aquino to John Ferro, January 22, X/1975.698 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, January 28, X/1975.[index-377_1.jpg]- 377 -[During IX/1974 John Ferro and I embarked upon an exchange of correspondencetouched off by thefollowing memorandum of mine to the Priesthood.]* * *February 22, IX/1974Memorandum to the Priesthood of MendesA few evenings ago a crank-caller enquired whether I happened to be watchingCecil B. DeMille’s TheTen Commandments on television. “As a matter of fact, yes,” I replied. “Well,what happened to thoseEgyptians will happen to you, you infidel!” replied the voice; then “click” wentthe phone.The call I took in stride, but the incident started me thinking about the actualcircumstances of thecelebrated Exodus. Some time ago I touched briefly upon this in the Hoof, butthe treatment was fairlycursory. Here are some facts for your files:DeMille represented his film as true history, citing a number of ancienthistorians plus the “OldTestament” as proof. The Greek and Roman historians mentioned, however, simplycited the Hebrewscriptures as their own sources of data. And “Exodus” itself is shot-throughwith so many proveninaccuracies as to be effectively worthless as an archæological referencedocument. Just about anyauthoritative archæological text, incidentally, will make this point.According to the film, Moses was raised as an adopted son of the Pharaoh Seti I,who despised hisown son, Rameses II. Rameses was portrayed as a cold-hearted tyrant, whoascended to the throne as anadult. He married a reluctant Nefretiri, who was actually in love with Moses. Inattempting to free theHebrews, Moses called down a plague which, among other things, slew Rameses’ ownfirstborn son.Pursuing Moses, Rameses lost an entire army of chariots in the famous Red Seaepisode. Moses then tookhis Hebrew followers to Mount Sinai, which looked obligingly impressive with agood deal of volcanicaction. To quote Yul in another of his roles: Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.All of this made for a zesty film with some fantastic special effects, but froma factual standpoint itwas an outright disaster. Here’s what really happened, according to majorscholars of the period:Rameses I, the father of Seti I, assumed the throne upon the death of Horemheb(the general whosalvaged Egypt after Akhenaten had practically ruined it). This was quite anaccomplishment on the partof Rameses I, inasmuch as he came from Tanis, the capital of the cult of Set. Atthis time the Osirian faithwas making strong inroads into Egypt, and the followers of Set had to combat agood deal of prejudiceagainst them.Things changed a bit when the new Pharaoh took over, naturally. The Priesthoodof Set now assumedan authority almost equal with that of the Priesthood of Amon (the god ofEgyptian royalty). A certainamount of lip-service was paid to the Osiris cult for the sake of unity in theentire country, but that wasabout it.- 378 -During the reign of Rameses I, the Hebrews under Joseph are supposed to havesought refuge inEgypt, but Egyptian records mention nothing of this. Nor is there any evidenceto support the Bible’scontention that Rameses decreed the slaughter of every Hebrew boy-child at thetime of Moses’ birth.Seti I (“Glory of Set”) continued his father’s work. He was one of Egypt’s mostsuccessful rulers inboth domestic and foreign affairs. Among other things he built a vastunderground temple to Set at Abydos- an especially blasphemous thing to do, inasmuch as Abydos was the capital ofthe Osiris cult! He neveradopted anyone named Moses, and he got along famously with his son. As a matterof fact he was soproud of him that he decided to do a rather unprecedented thing: When Rameseswas about 12, Seti hadhim crowned Pharaoh - so that he might see his son’s glory while he himself wasstill alive. Father and sonreigned as co-Pharaohs for a number of years.Upon Seti’s death, Rameses was so devoted to his memory that for the next twentyyears he wasconstantly building temples and monuments to him.As far as his own reign was concerned, Rameses II was far and away the mostpowerful and effectivePharaoh Egypt ever had. He set a longevity record, ruling for 67 years. He hadfour queens and over 110(!) children. His firstborn son did not die as a child, but grew to manhood andbecame a Priest of Amon inThebes. Rameses moved the capital of Egypt from Thebes to Tanis, which herenamed Pi-Ramse in hisown honor. He knew nothing of anyone named Moses, and he was thoroughlyindifferent towards theHebrews. From all available records Rameses II was immensely popular with hissubjects, and was agenerous, kind, and just monarch.The Pharaoh of the Exodus was Rameses’ successor (and #14 son) Merenptah. Sincehis father hadlived so long, Merenptah was already an old man when he received the DoubleCrown.And now Egypt faced danger from the west. Two Saharan tribes, the Tjehnyu andthe Tjemeh, werethreatening invasion. [Only a short time before, Rameses II had quelled theirfirst rebellion, as is shown ona beautiful bas-relief in the great temple at Abu-Simbel.] Maraye, the leader ofthese two tribes, arrangedto provoke an uprising in Palestine to split the Egyptians’ forces. A group ofPalestinian slaves in Egypt’sGoshen province were also supposed to rise up against their masters.Merenptah, however, struck first. In a six-hour battle in the western delta, heslaughtered 7,000 ofMaraye’s followers. When news of this reached Maraye’s “allies” in Palestine,they very suddenlychanged their minds about making trouble for the Egyptians.This left the state slaves in Goshen sort of holding the bag, a realizationwhich presumably didn’t thrillthem much. They had a resourceful leader named Moses, who figured the thing todo was to split.Evidently Merenptah decided that Egypt would be none the worse for the absenceof such potentiallytreacherous slaves, so they were allowed to depart. Nevertheless the road fromGoshen to Sinai was linedwith a number of Egyptian military posts, and the Egyptian army wasn’t veryfavorably disposed towardsthe Hebrews. The group was raided and harassed constantly, and only a heavycloudburst at the BitterLakes - which hampered the chariots of the Egyptians - enabled them to escape.This rainstorm, which isreported as exactly that in the oldest existing text of “Exodus” (dating to the10th century BCE and calledthe “J Manuscript” by archæologists), was to become puffed up over successivecenturies as the “partingof the Red Sea”.Finally the Hebrews would have had a rough time finding a suitably fiery volcanoin Sinai at which tohold their Ten Commandments party. Geologists are uniform in asserting that theentire peninsula was freefrom any volcanic activity whatsoever during that era. Incidentally the word“Hebrew” derives from theEgyptian hieroglyphic khabiru, meaning “displaced persons”.Michael A. Aquino* * *February 26, IX/1974Dear Michael,As I expressed in one of my superfluous notes to the High Priest, yourinformation bulletins toregional representatives are invaluable. I consider myself reasonably aware onthe topics in question, and I- 379 -find them informative. For less articulate or knowledgeable representatives theymust seem “Devil-sent”. Ican imagine the time and effort involved, but they are a marvelous and efficientdevice for maximumeffectiveness in dispatching accurate information through the appropriateavailable channels. Once againyou demonstrate your resourcefulness and your efficacy as an official. Let uslive in the hope that thoseconcerned will deliver the ammunition with which you have supplied them withcommensurate skill andaccuracy. In such a hope I am not too confident, but, contrary to all pastexperience, I will continue tohope!Will you indulge me in a bit of pedantry? There was a slight historicalinaccuracy relative to the dataon the co-regnal years of Seti I and Rameses II. Knowing your impeccableefficiency I take the liberty ofsharing a few tidbits of fairly insignificant detail.Contrary to your assertion, such a co-regency was not at all unprecedented, mostespecially during theNew Kingdom. In point of fact, such overlapping of regnal years is a veritablebete noire of XVIIIDynasty Egyptology. Co-regnal years have made it almost impossible to determinewith accuracy not onlythe actual regnal periods of Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Hatshepsut, but theirrespective familialrelationships to the great Thutmose III.Some historians, in addition, are of the opinion that Rameses II did displace,by stealthy means, abrother previously designated or assumed to be the heir-apparent. On this latterissue, however, I have notthe benefit of any recent treatments.In any case, the movie in question has no redeeming historical or dramaticfactors, though thetechnical aspect has some merit.On the subject of Egyptology I recently studied two works which might be ofinterest to you. Theolder of the two, published in 1960, was never before readily accessible to me.The work, by J.G.Griffiths, is entitled The Conflict of Horus and Seth, and contends that theHorus-Seth myth, unlike that ofOsiris, had an historical and political origin, i.e. the unification of the twolands into a single kingdomunder Menes.The other study, by a Dutch scholar, Velde, is entitled Seth, God of Confusion.It was originallypublished a few years ago, but only recently in English. Velde repudiates theGriffiths thesis with someimpressive evidence and argumentation. However, I found it most engrossing inregard to the extendeddiscussion of Seth as the personified embodiment of refusal to submit to rulesand arbitrary distinctions,the principle of indulgence, intemperance, and undifferentiated sexual activity,e.g. his advances to Isisand his assault on his nephew. Of course I can hardly do the work justice in afew lines; it was fascinating.John* * *March 5, IX/1974Dear John,I was thoroughly fascinated by the points you brought to light on Egyptology. Tobe honest, my recentletter to the Priesthood was the result of only a few hours’ concentratedresearch in my own files and theSanta Barbara Library. I made what I considered to be a valiant attempt tocorrelate everything, but youknow what a foul hodgepodge of contradictions Egyptian history is! My ultimatesource materials turnedout to be Lives of the Pharaohs by Pierre Montet (Member of the FrenchInstitute) from the S.B.L., andHeinrich Brugsch-Bey’s Egypt Under the Pharaohs and Walter Fairservis’ TheAncient Kingdoms of theNile from my own bookshelf. Fairservis cites dates as follows:Thutmose I1530-1515? BCEThutmose II1515?-1505 BCEHatshepsut1515?-1484 BCEThutmose III1504-1450 BCEAccording to Brugsch-Bey, Thutmose I left the throne to Thutmose II, butHatshepsut succeeded inforcing her brother to allow her an equal hand in running the government. Ifelder brother did not getalong with sister, neither did younger brother, as he also secured the right toco-reign with Hatshepsut by- 380 -force. I have come across no tomb, temple, or monument inscriptions to verifythe existence of a thirdbrother. [There was a sister of Hatshepsut’s who died young - Kheb-neferu-Ra.She was entombed withher father, his sister/queen Aahmes, Hatshepsut, and brothers II & III atDier-el-Bahari, a V.I.P. site in theTheban Valley.] And now you know as much as I know on that!After many years of stubbing my academic toe on the ungrounded assumptions ofcountless Egyptianhistory authors, I have become pretty cautious. One of the reasons that I amfond of Brugsch-Bey is thathis book is based entirely on direct quotes from Egyptian monuments. His book isnow dated (finalrevision: 1891 CE), but I have found it invaluable nonetheless. Fairservis goesinto little detail within thevarious dynasties, but he seems painstakingly objective on the statements hedoes make. I suppose thatMontet is as accurate as any Frenchman can be.At any rate you’re certainly correct in your observation that co-kings werenothing new in Egypt. Mylatest research has turned up yet another interesting tidbit: While Rameses Iand Seti I did get along liketwo peas in a pod, Seti had another, very practical motive for crowning his sonat age 12. By that time, itseems, Osirian resentment against the “evil” Pharaoh had become so pronounced -in spite of Seti’s effortsto downplay his name by the use of such aliases as “Usiri” and “Usiri-Seti” -that at least a ceremonialabdication seemed called for. This, however, didn’t prevent Seti fromconstructing his many temples andmonuments to the Prince of Darkness.My admiration for The Ten Commandments stems largely from the facts that (a) YulBrynner makessuch a tremendous Pharaoh, and (b) Elmer Bernstein’s soundtrack picks up whereWagner left off.DeMille was so impressed with the music that he said it would outlast both thecomposer and himself.I am extremely interested in those two books you mentioned - The Conflict ofHorus and Seth andSeth, God of Confusion - particularly if they deal with the original Horus/Setmyth-cycle and not theOsirian corruption. I would greatly appreciate your sending me publishing data,which I will forward toRonald Barrett in New York, who runs a book-search service as part of “TheMagician”.Suitable Egyptian-motif music for ritual use is a bitch to find, and wescheduled a great many Egyptianrituals during the heyday of Nineveh. Soundtracks were a great help: T.T.C. ,Khartoum, Cleopatra, andLawrence of Arabia [as long as one left out the hit-parade theme]. Sometimes Iwould cheat and use aRoman march from Quo Vadis or Ben-Hur!.Michael* * *March 9, IX/1974Dear Michael,I received your latest epistle two days ago, and, as usual, I enjoyed it verymuch. You have, perhapsinadvertently, got me started on one of my favorite subjects; it is on yourhead!Regarding your comments on Egyptian history and its sources, I have severalobservations. From thevantage point of historiography and historical methodology, it is, other factorsbeing equal, best to employspecialized works of the latest date available. Of course there are many otherelements to be considered ina critical evaluation, but recent scholarship is of supreme importance. This isespecially true ofEgyptology, wherein so much work and so many new techniques have appeared in thepast few decades,to say nothing of the entire 20th century.There are, to be sure, timeless classics, like the History of Egypt by JamesHenry Breasted, and theworks of the early giants of Egyptology, such as Petrie and Maspero, but theyrequire knowledge andcaution if they are to be used as research sources. Moreover the use of primarysources, such asmonumental inscriptions and papyri, while certainly laudable, can be deceptivebecause of peculiarchronology, conventional formulæ, and deliberate misdirection and deception.The dates you provide for the Thutmose trilogy and Hatshepsut are conventionalbut up-to-date asregards general chronological revaluation. However, any date scale selected isat best an approximation,based upon some relatively arbitrary point of reference. This accounts for thesubstantial discrepanciesfound in the work of reputable scholars working at about the same time.- 381 -In the case of the issue in question, the Thutmoses and Hatshepsut, I recentlywent through a smallvolume of essays recently published on XVIII Dynasty chronology and the problemsinvolved. Apparentlyrecent discoveries and contingent revaluation have given us serious grounds forquestioning not only thedating of the four reigns and co-regencies, but even the traditional familialrelationships assumed.I am aware that Seti’s name created something of a problem, but I think you jumpto conclusions onthe question of the use of another name for official purposes. It is a logicassumption which you make, andnot unheard before; but to the best of my knowledge it is unwarranted.Each Pharaoh had at least five names; often more were added as the years passed.These were highlyformalized, there being a “Horus of Gold” name, a “Two Ladies Name” (thetutelary goddesses), a “Sonof Ra” name, etc. Only the “Son of Ra” name was assumed by a prince at birth.The other four or morewere acquired at the time of accession. The fourth of these was the “King ofUpper and Lower Egypt”name, and was the one normally used in official correspondence and formalproclamation. The “Son ofRa” name, which the king had used since birth, was added at the end of thoseassumed at the accession,and like the fourth name was encircled in a cartouche.Thutmose was the “Son of Ra” name of Thutmose III. His “King of Upper and LowerEgypt” name,by which he would more normally be addressed in formal exchange, was Menkheperra(“Enduring ofform is Ra”). This would have been true of Seti I and any other Pharaoh by thattime.I think that it is possible to exaggerate the theological issues regarding Seth.It is salutary to rememberthat we are dealing with a very flexible and decentralized pantheon, far removedin concept as well as timefrom later systems which required well-defined gods, mutually exclusive, andwhich made much more ofan issue of identifying with the “light” and repudiating the “dark”.In general, though there were periods of rejection, Seth was much like theChthonian deities ofclassical Greece: respected and feared, but not commanding much devotion. Butthen all this seems quitenatural. It is interesting that the founder of the XX Dynasty, the last greatdynasty of the Imperial Period,and the father of Rameses III, the last great imperial Pharaoh, was oneSethnakht!The two books you used in addition to the 19th century work are reputable works,though very generaland necessarily simplistic on complex issues.You joke about Montet, but he is a fine scholar. He did a new work on Egyptianreligion, the firstserious treatment, to the best of my knowledge, since Henri Frankfort’s luminousand enduring work. TheMontet book has been translated recently, I understand, though the University ofSan Francisco has onlythe French version. I have perused it, but my facility with French has declined,so I await the English text.Well, good and wise friend, I thank you for your kind indulgence. It is jollygood sport, as the Britishwould say, to play these little intellectual games. Perhaps it is all a charade,but if so what a gloriousillusion the whole dance is: chaos into cosmos and back again. It would be dullindeed if Aphophis werenot always after that sun! Would it not?I terminate this typically brief and relevant missive by assuring you of mygenuine regard and that Iremain, as ever, Very respectfully yours.John* * *March 12, IX/1974Dear John,As usual I can fault neither your academics nor your arguments! Some time back -when I began toturn out “historical” articles for the Cloven Hoof - I discovered what, for lackof a better term, I shall callthe “bottomless pit” phenomenon. To wit: Even the most apparently conservativestatement blurs veryswiftly when one takes the time to research the premises upon which it is based.Fact after fact turns out tobe opinion, and far too frequently such opinions are based upon the mostinsubstantial foundationsthemselves. [As a matter of fact - this one I’m sure of! - my Hoof article onlogic was inspired by personalfrustration regarding the B.P. phenomenon.]- 382 -Egypt was an absolute nightmare of bottomless pits. I ran up against somethingof a choice: either (a)hang my hat on the opinions of some recognized authority, venturing noconclusions having personal bias;or (b) act on the assumption that “history” is actually propaganda ennobled byage, and strike out inopinion-directions that might run drastically askew of the norm.Perhaps I was influenced in my choice by the time which I spent in thePsychological Warfare Schoolat Fort Bragg. There we learned to ferret out and lay bare all the devices ofthe skilled propagandist, andwe used both contemporary news publications and historical texts for exercise.You would be shocked athow vulnerable some of the latter are to PSYOP analysis. I’m now at the pointwhere I judge a historybook almost entirely by the position and background of its author - whichthemselves are subject to amajor degree of manipulation.The end result of all this was that, callously enough, I have “used” Egyptianmythology as a PSYOPdevice to illustrate and reinforce certain precepts of Satanic philosophy. Thisshould be obvious to aperson such as yourself upon reading the “Source” article in Hoof #IV-8(Appendix #67). Budge et al.would turn up their snouts in horror at some of my oversimplifications and valuejudgments. But then thestandards by which they would measure the merit of their writings are not mine.Lewis Carroll’s celebrated egghead came close to the mark when he said thatwords meant what hechose them to mean. I would alter that slightly and suggest that words mean whatI can convince thelistener that they do. The same holds true for gods.On the face of it you are probably correct in stating that Set and the otherEgyptian gods had nowherenear the impact upon Egyptian politics that some of my writings imply. But Ihave understood Satanism toempower us to create our own gods - past, present, and future.Egypt is long dead, and the events that transpired there cannot be undone by anAquino any more thanthey were created by a Montet or a Frankfort. But, whereas the brutalacademicians would reduce theKhemite pantheon to an archæological statistic, I am minded to bring them tolife. Perhaps I shall do soonly for myself; perhaps others will be drawn into my “dreams” as well. This isan open question.At the time when I first encountered the Church of Satan, I had “used up” theother philosophies thatwere available. In turn I had exposed myself to conventional religions, atheism,agnosticism. Each provedhighly unsatisfactory.In the two years before I sent in my application to 6114 California Street, Iburied myself among theexistentialists, thinking that here I could understand the “meaning” of life. Itwas a terrible moment for mewhen I concluded that there was no meaning - that we are pathetic, blindaccidents. For a moment Icontemplated the idea of suicide. It would have proved nothing, but it wouldhave been anacknowledgment that life is futile. Why endure the pains of existence forabsolutely no reason? Would not“blessed oblivion” be preferable?At this point Anton LaVey said, “Where there is no meaning, we ourselves cancreate it. Thus we arenot creatures, but creators; we are gods.” It took me a long time to understandthe full implications ofsuch a hypothesis, but even in its most immediate sense it was a philosophicallifeline. I seized upon it,and I am changed. Now, perhaps, I am a “Martian at Nürnberg”.The delight that I now take in life results from the meaning that I create forother lives. It is beside thepoint whether that meaning be positive or negative - just that it be there:“Do you remember writing in your diary,” he said, “that it did not matterwhether I was a friend or anenemy, since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to?You were right. I enjoytalking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except thatyou happen to be insane.”- O’Brien to Winston Smith, 1984It somewhat saddens me to realize that even when you offer the masses somethingbetter and a choicebetween freedom and bondage with regard to religion or even just a way of life,most will choose bondage.My only consolation, though, is that now people have a choice, and those worthyof consideration and- 383 -capable of emancipation have somewhere to turn. As far as the rest areconcerned, if they need a villain tofulfill their masochistic psychological needs, then I’m glad to oblige!- Anton LaVey to M.A.A., IV/1969Dr. LaVey has been my O’Brien. As it happens, he is a friend as well. But werehe to cross me off thelist tomorrow, it would make no difference with respect to the operation he hasperformed. Can youunderstand that? I think so.Perhaps I in turn shall become O’Brien to others. As a consequence of my workwithin the Church ofSatan, I have made both friends and enemies. I recognize neither category as agauge of success. More amI concerned with the impact that association with me has had upon theindividuals in question.At the time that I penned the Diabolicon, I had just read John Fowles’ TheMagus. Anton LaVeyreceived a new alias: Conchis. There was an episode in the story where he drewthe protagonist’s attentionto an antique Greek statue wearing an “Archaic smile”. He said:That is the truth. Not the hammer and sickle. Not the stars and stripes. Not thecross. Not the Sun. Notgold. Not yin and yang. But the smile.Because a star explodes and a thousand worlds like ours die, we know this worldis. That is the smile:that what might not be, is.When I die, I shall have this by my bedside. It is the last face that I want tosee.Fowles’ protagonist decided that the smile was one “of dramatic irony, of thosewho have privilegedinformation”. As the Satanist casts the gods of mythology in his own image, hesenses that irony and hasaccess to that privileged information. And his is the Archaic smile.Michael* * *March 15, IX/1974Dear Michael,Just a brief note until the next ponderous pile of pedantry proceeds from mypreposterously prolificpen [how’s that for agonized alliteration?].I was aware, at least in general terms, of your philosophic approach to history,the gods, etc., but Ienjoyed your superbly articulate explanation immensely. You were clear, concise,and direct. I havelearned something of great value in understanding a person I respect. I thankyou for your honesty and forcaring to share your ideas with me. Again my thanks and good thoughts to you.May the Vernal Equinoxbring you pleasure, joy, and magical renewal.John* * *March 18, IX/1974Dear Michael,Anton said to tell you he agrees with your approach to “facts”, historic orotherwise, re your letter toJohn Ferro.Diane LaVey* * *Vernal Equinox IX/1974Dear Michael,Seasonal greetings and respectful salutations. Finally great Ishtar has emergedfrom out theunderworld to reclothe the earth in verdant vesture. It has been a long, if notunpleasant winter, and Irejoice in this day.As I mentioned in my brief missive, I was pleased with your last letter becauseit helped me tounderstand you better, and I am interested in and desirous of understandingintelligent and resourcefulindividuals.- 384 -I see that we are complementary individuals in our epistemological assumptionsas in so much else.Not only are we unlike one another in temperament, but our training has been sodifferent.Naturally as a historian I would find a value in the facts of history other thanthat which you posittherein. At the same time I admit the difficulties and complexities involved inascertaining what thecommonality are wont to term a “simple fact”. I do not mean to engage in meretautologicalargumentation. It is that I understand how deceptive and illusive supposedlyfactual data can be, while atthe same time I am committed to discovery of “things as they were” to thegreatest extent possible.Facts may, indeed, be used in many ways, and that is one element which makes thetask of thehistorian an arduous and uncertain one. Yet I do contend that it is important toknow what happened, whatthe gods meant to those who fashioned or envisioned them, and to accuratelyascertain when. Truth is, initself, a liberating factor; and not human inaccuracy nor human limitation canobliterate that fact.Prescinding from the question of how one uses knowledge, the possession of it isan impregnablefortress of strength, both personal and social. What Seti did, who and whatHorus represents, and when thesyncretic figure of Serapis emerged is important to know.Granted, once known, knowledge has many uses: personal gratification, socialenlightenment,deliberate misdirection. Pour moi, I tend more and more to opt for the first ofthese alternatives. As for thesecond, though I am, I suppose, a pedagogue, I more and more doubt thepossibility. The third possibilityis, without a doubt, a powerful weapon in all its forms. However, to use iteffectively one must first havethe knowledge, then possess the wisdom to employ it properly.This is all quite difficult to encompass within a few lines, particularly whenone is given tocircumlocution. You can, I trust, understand why I retreat to the dusty stacksof provincial libraries and adecreasing circle of associates? Enough said; I refuse to become morose.Assuring you again of my respect and affection, I remain, Your obedient servant.John* * *April 12, IX/1974Dear John,Now don’t get me wrong - I do hold factual history in high esteem. My point issimply that I considerthe overwhelming majority of “history” to be open to any number ofinterpretations. For example, you canportray Napoleon as a great man or as a war criminal, depending upon what eventsof his life you include,omit, and/or emphasize. When I read something in a history book, therefore, Idraw my own conclusionsto the greatest possible extent rather than adopt those of the author on trust.Also there is this: Why do people write history books? They do it because theyhave an argumentativeaxe to grind. There is some historical event which they feel has been treatedeither incorrectly orinsufficiently. The injustice demands remedy; hence a new book is required.The first thing I attempt upon opening a new tome is to pinpoint the motive ofthe author. Once I findit, I make appropriate allowances for bias and then proceed to evaluate suchmaterial as the book doesintroduce.Assuredly my own interpretations of history are likewise biased. So are yours,Anton LaVey’s, andHenry Kissinger’s. I won’t deliberately destroy facts, but I will not hesitateto advance my owninterpretations of those facts whenever I think I see things more clearly than,say, Budge.As arrogant as it may seem, I do feel that I can see the forest of Egypt - asopposed to the trees - betterthan many an Egyptologist I have read to date. Some of the trees too, for thatmatter. My own argumentsare still fragmentary, but they’re becoming steadily less so.I have read in a number of sources that opposition to Set-worship becameobsessive commencing withthe XXII Dynasty. Even Budge says [in The Mummy]:Set’s worship dates from the V Dynasty, and he continued to be a most populargod in Egypt until theXIX Dynasty; kings delighted to call themselves “Beloved of Set” and to becompared to him for valor- 385 -when the records of their battles were written down. He probably represented thedestructive power of theSun’s heat.Between the XXII and XXV Dynasties a violent reaction set in against this god.His statues and figureswere smashed, his effigy was hammered out from the bas-reliefs and stelæ inwhich it appeared, and frombeing a beneficent god, and a companion of Amon and his brother-gods, he becamethe personification of allevil, and the opponent of all good.Bronze figures of Set are very rare indeed. The British Museum possesses two …When I bought thelarger figure, it was bent double, evidently by a violent blow, given probablywhen the reaction against thisgod’s worship set in. Faience figures of Set I have never seen.And from Mythologie Generale Larousse:Under the New Empire, Rameses II, whose father was named Seti, the “Setian”, didnot hesitate toproclaim himself the “Beloved of Set”. The worshippers of Osiris, however, wereindignant that a cultshould be rendered to the murderer of the “Good One”, and Seti caused the cursedimage to be effaced fromthe engraved tablets on the walls of his tomb and proclaimed himself no longerthe “Setian” but the“Osirian”.It is only towards the middle of the 10th century, under the kings of the XXIIDynasty, that the assassinof Osiris really began to undergo the punishment for his crime. His statues werebroken, and on the bas-reliefs his features were smashed with hammers. Anyone who wrote his name wasforced to erase it. Finallyhe was driven from the Egyptian pantheon and made a god of the unclean. Set, theancient Lord of UpperEgypt, ended by becoming a kind of devil, enemy of all the gods.There are any number of similar passages I could cite, but my point is that theauthors are jumping tothe most convenient conclusions where the anti-Set movement is concerned. Wasthe actual sequence ofevents all that pat? I am inclined to doubt it. Popular movements are never thatcut-and-dry.Some peculiar factors seem to have been operating on the Set cult duringDynasties XIX-XXII, and Iam not satisfied that Egyptologists who see everything through Osiris-tintedspectacles have the rightanswers. Hence some of my conjectures in the Hoof and elsewhere.Michael* * *April 17, IX/1974Dear Michael,Your remarks on historical interpretation in particular, and intellectualspeculation in general, werequite well put; on several points we would be in mutual concord. I would hope,however, that at its besthistorical research and writing would involve greater intellectual integrity andbreadth than the proving ofa point. The nature of scientific methodology involves preliminary hypotheses,retesting, and revaluation,often leading to conclusions quite distinct from those originally envisioned,sometimes contrary to what isearnestly desired. That is the theory; in my limited experience that has beenthe reality.When using the works of scholars I avoid taking only what I want from them,though I am aware thatan apparently plausible case can be constructed for a cherished theory in thismanner. Though it is farmore demanding and time-consuming, the collection of as much data as possiblefrom competent sources,comparative analysis, and carefully discriminating conclusions produce far moreaccurate, if less tidyresults.As for bias, certainly it is to be discerned and taken into account.Contemporary scholars often makean effort to “share” their bias or biases with the reader. Others need not doso. However, some are cleverand subtle, terribly convincing. The Osiride orientation of scholarly work onEgyptian religion I wouldattribute to the realities of Egyptian theological evolution rather than tobias. This would apply not only toindigenous theological developments, but to the adumbrations contingent uponforeign input andexportation, i.e. foreign conquest and syncretistic cults.- 386 -I would tend to accept the XXII Dynasty identification as the probable point ofvehement vilificationof Seth. A subtle change may be noted as early as the beginning of the NewKingdom, when depiction ofthe Pharaoh being “crowned” by Horus and Seth, the usual representation in termsof the Two Lands, wasaltered to exclude Seth in favor of Thoth. Noteworthy in itself, addedsignificance is derived from theassociation of Thoth with Isis in the Osiris-Seth conflict.With the notable exception of the XIX Dynasty, it was probably a gradual declinein the prominenceaccorded Seth, commensurate with the ever-increasing power of the priesthoods.The fact that Hirihor, theHigh Priest of Amon-Ra, actually usurped the Pharaonic dignity in the XXIDynasty, would be a logicalprelude to the extreme dualism and repudiation of Seth characteristic of thesucceeding dynasty.At any rate, I am pleased we both enjoy the Egyptian past so much.John* * *April 23, IX/1974Memorandum to the Priesthood of MendesIf you spend any time at all around the Central Grotto, you learn very quicklyto avoid getting into anargument with John A. Ferro at all costs. Back in the Cretaceous Period one ofhis ancestors was raped bya Thesaurus Rex, and the traits are still there. He will hogtie you withnonrestrictive participle phrases,stun you with one or two compound gerunds, and finally administer a devastatingcoup de grace with amerciless adverbial objective. Soon you are reduced to the point where your onlyresponse is: “Oh, yeah?”Even if you win the debate, you feel rather like the loutish Neanderthal who hasjust brained a far-more-advanced Cro-Magnon with a club. Like why bother, man?Michael A. Aquino* * *April 25, IX/1974Dear Michael,You knew your last memorandum would provoke me to a response, though I havenever required aprovocation! Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, indeed; it is a rather charming andrefreshing simile at that.Seriously, I truly appreciate your flexibility and sense of humor in regard tomy tedious tantrums. TheRegional Agents ought to be intrigued, if not befuddled by our exchange. Thereis no doubt in my mindbut that you supply them with more than useful information. Your practicalsagacity and spontaneoushumor are instructive glimpses of living Satanism. I hope this doesn’t sound asif I am relegating you tothe function of an audiovisual aid in teaching Satanism, but I do regard yourmethod and manner ofdelivery to be of exceptional value.Let us hope, at this juncture, that your view of humanity and not mine iscorrect. In that instance thoseconcerned may profit by the example given.John* * *May 10, IX/1974Dear John,In your last letter you remarked, “Let us hope, at this juncture, that your viewof humanity and notmine is correct.” I presume you refer to my dogged, but sometimes strainedoptimism concerning theorganizational grassroots structure of the Church, or what Diane LaVey and Ioccasionally describe as“digging in the manure pile in the hope of finding a pony down there somewhere”.There is something funny about that comment of yours. You are the historian andI the politicalscientist. So first I curl my lip at the supposed objectivity of history books,and you fling down yourgauntlet in indignation. Then you express revulsion at the uselessness ofattempting to cope with present-day society, and I am the one who says that all is not lost. Didja ever get thefeeling we’ve both beenconditioned like rats in a laboratory? Frightening, isn’t it?Michael[index-387_1.jpg]- 387 -The 1971 success of The Abominable Dr. Phibes prompted a 1972 sequel: Dr. PhibesRises Again. Asthe Moon and the stars reached a precise conjunction, Anton Phibes’ vault openedand a machine pumpedthe formaldehyde out of his veins and his bottled blood back in. He rose,stretched, cracked his finger-joints, and seated himself at his organ, its scarlet glass pipes now coveredwith dust and cobwebs. As hebegan to play, the dæmoness Vulnavia reappeared amidst a swirling pattern ofkaleidoscopic light, clad asbefore in the height of early-1930s’ fashion.The Abominable Doctor’s goal this time was to travel to Egypt with his stilldead, still embalmed wifeVictoria. In an ancient, subterranean temple he had discovered the secret riverwhose currents wouldimpart eternal life to those sailing upon them. Only at the next full Moon wouldthe river flow again, andso Phibes meant to revive Victoria and to ensure eternal life for her andhimself as well.Within the temple’s caverns and chambers Phibes had created for himself a lavishArt Deco salon,complete with a second scarlet glass pipe organ, to rival that in his grotesqueLondon mansion. The“Phibes Clockwork Wizards” mechanical band had been rewound, of course, andduring the film gaveperiodic concerts as a carnival nickelodeon machine, a Scottish bagpipe band,and “Alexandrian Quartet”.Having thwarted - with a series of outrageously “camp” murders - the police andrival archæologists,Phibes and Victoria sail down the magic river to rejoin Vulnavia. As the glow ofthe sculptured Art Decolamps on his gondola fades into the blackness, Phibes can be heard singing -through the microphoneplugged into his neck and connected to an ornate gramophone horn - “Over theRainbow”.Crucial to Dr. Phibes Rises Again, as to The Abominable Dr. Phibes is thedifference between the“world” of Phibes and the “world” of his antagonists. Superficially Phibes is a“mad doctor”, even aparody of one. The police and the archæologists, on the other hand, representsane and sober society. But,as in the first film, the world of Phibes seems ever so much more artistic andbeautiful than its “sane andsober” counterpart; and the efforts of the “sane and sober” police to stopPhibes would be annoying andfrustrating were they not so obviously futile. Not having the vaguest idea ofPhibes’ actual values ormotives, the police have no means to anticipate his plans. They fumble andstumble through the film,always ineffectual and always too late.To try to understand the crisis of 1975 and Anton LaVey’s role in it withoutunderstanding his “world”is to emulate the hapless Inspector Trout who pursued the Abominable Doctorthrough both Phibes films.Once that “world” is brought into focus, on the other hand, actions which mightotherwise seem senselessand destructive are revealed to have a certain weird but consistent logic oftheir own.The reader of this history will already have glimpsed the strange and magicalworld of the AbominableDr. LaVey. It is a world of medieval Black Magic, a world of shabby and cynicalcarnivals, a world ofclassical music, a world of Chambers’ dreams and Lovecraft’s horrors, a world inrevolt againsthypocritical society yet in quest of an essential dignity in mankind. These arethe elements which wentinto Anton LaVey’s first three books, and which gave the original Church ofSatan its unique character.- 388 -Had the world of Anton LaVey gone no deeper, the Church might have continuedindefinitely as a nationalor international movement. But Anton’s world did go deeper - much deeper.Like Anton Phibes, Anton LaVey was ultimately interested in the phenomenon oflife. He wanted tounderstand it, then to conquer it; he wanted to become immortal. In the SatanicBible he revealed the firsthint of this ambition. “If a person has been vital throughout his life and hasfought to the end for hisearthly existence,” he wrote, “it is this ego which will refuse to die, evenafter the expiration of the fleshwhich housed it.” 699At the same time, however, the Church of Satan took the position that the fleshwhich housed the egowas the only tangible reality. In the documentary film Satanis Anton remarked:We feel that the so-called carnal side or nature of man is the more important.We feel that the soul isjust a pittance, something that’s sort of “wrung out”. If you squeeze an orange,you get a few drops of juiceout of it, and certainly this is the essence. But this doesn’t mean that theorange is any less important,simply because the juice is out of it. We feel that the body of man, the carnalsymbolism of man, is by farthe more important. We feel that true transcendentalism is to rise above thepuerile inventions of man - forhis own masochistic needs, perhaps, in the way of spiritual or soul guidance -and to recognize his baserinstincts, his carnal existence as the end or byproduct and as the epitome, theheight of all great creation. 700Preservation of life, then, appeared to imply the preservation of the orange.The body must beimmunized against death, not the spirit. For awhile Anton considered cryonics[Chapter #23], then begancasting around for other means to cheat death.Like Robert W. Chambers’ Boris the sculptor in The King in Yellow [Chapter #15],he considered thetransfer of life from a natural into an artificial body. The creation oflifelike androids would be a first steptowards an eventual cyborg vehicle for the egocentric intelligence, just as Dr.Phibes’ experience inbuilding his clockwork band had ultimately enabled him to rebuild his “dead”body with electronic,mechanical, and cosmetic devices.Hence the sculptured mannequins in 6114’s Den of Iniquity [Chapter #23] weresomething more thanornaments. They were Golems, animated not through science but through magic.In a 1974 interview for Argosy magazine (Appendix #119), Anton remarked:Yes, I make people out of polyurethane and fiberglass. They’re partiallyautomated. I move them withsolenoids. I suppose most of them are actually disgusting human beings. Drunkfloozies, sailors trying topick up women, and one of them even passed out under the bar.But I created them. So they become not reprehensible, but people you would meetat any neighborhoodbar. Friends that you sit and have a drink with. Sometimes I have one of themget behind the drums, and Isit at the organ. We play together for a few hours, real ricky-tick style, likein the fifties. 701The Den’s denizens were not in fact solenoid-animated, hence could not emulatethe clockworkmusicians of Dr. Phibes. But Anton had nonetheless given them “life” by allowingthem to partake of hisown life-force. To him they were alive, when and how he wished them to be[Chapter #23]. And Anton’sandroids were merely part of a larger, time-frozen environment that he intendedto create in the Den ofIniquity and its adjoining “Blue Room”, in keeping with his theory of EroticCrystallization Inertia (ECI)[Chapter #23].During the first several years of the Church of Satan, the “Blue Room” had beendecorated in blue andwalled with mirrors. On the occasions I visited it, it contained either anangular coffin as its sole article of699 LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Bible, page #94.700 LaVey, Anton in Satanis, the Devil’s Mass.701 LaVey, Anton in Argosy magazine, June 1975, page #43.- 389 -furniture, or else nothing at all. It was a ritual chamber designed for anElektrischen Vorspiele far morepowerful than anything which could be conducted in the main ritual chamber, andit was the second mostatmospherically-charged room at 6114 after the Council Chamber.By 1974, however, this haven for the Hounds of Tindalos had been radicallyremodeled. “I’ve createdanother room,” Anton told Argosy, “the perfect replica of a cheap hotel, eventhe smells. Cheap booze andurine and stale smoke permeating the wallpaper, the neon sign…” 702When I finally saw the remodeled Blue Room during one of my last visits to 6114,I hardly knew whatto think. Here, Anton told me, he would sometimes stay for hours or even dayswhen he felt in need of itsatmosphere. That atmosphere was one which radiated nothing but loneliness,despair, and degeneracy. Itwas the sort of “home” that any one of the Den of Iniquity’s forlorn mannequinsmight have crawleddejectedly back to after having tried to drown its soul-destroying influence inalcohol for a few hours.I could only presume that the strain of being the Magus of the Age of Satan, andthe High Priest of itsChurch of Satan, was simply too much for the human being that was Anton SzandorLaVey. At leastoccasionally he needed to change back into Clark Kent, and in this hideaway hecould do it, purginghimself of the built-up frustrations of an otherwise Nietzschean existence.Along with Anton LaVey’s growing interest in androids and atmospheres of despaircame hisincreasing fascination with Art Deco, as mentioned in the collectors’ magazinearticle reprinted asAppendix #120.Art Deco is a movement through which the decorative arts passed in the late1920s and early 1930s,generally acknowledged to have been touched off by the 1925 Exposition des ArtsDecoratifs etIndustriels in Paris. The “polite” art history establishment considers it to bea sort of commercializedbastardization of the Symbolist movement of the turn of the century, hencerelatively little has beenwritten about it. To the modern browser, “Art Deco” suggests a type of cheap,breezy-looking sculpturestamped out of plastic. In fact its psychology is far more subtle and magicalthan that.Art Deco arose as a consequence of several clashing influences on western -particularly British,French, and American - society after World War I. In the years after the MexicanRevolution and PanchoVilla’s raids into the United States, there was an artistic fascination withMexican (particularly pre-Columbian) art and architectural forms, as well as with those of the NorthAmerican Indians. Steppedpyramids and straight lines with sudden, tightly-knit curves, cacti, andstylized Suns were among theprincipal focuses of this interest.In 1922 the tomb of Tutankhamen was discovered by Howard Carter, resulting,among other things, inan artistic and decorative movement incorporating Egyptian themes. This too wasabsorbed into Art Deco.Finally, and most powerfully, there was the influence of the modern machine age.By the turn of thecentury machines were beginning to move beyond the quaint, awkward monstrositiesof the late 1800s tosleek, smooth, efficient devices. In 1900 Antoine de Saint-Exupery expressed thewonderment of mankindat this strange new encounter with the machine:Have you looked at a modern æroplane? Have you followed from year to year theevolution of its lines?Have you ever thought not only about the æroplane, but about whatever manbuilds, that all of man’sindustrial efforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spentover working draughts andblueprints, invariably culminate in the production of a thing whose sole andguiding principle is the ultimateprinciple of simplicity?It is as if there were a natural law which ordained that to achieve this end, torefine the curve of a pieceof furniture, or a ship’s keel, or the fuselage of an æroplane, until graduallyit partakes of the elementarypurity of the curve of a human breast or shoulder, there must be theexperimentation of several generationsof craftsmen. In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when thereis no longer anything to add butwhen there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been strippeddown to its nakedness.702 Ibid.- 390 -It results from this that perfection of invention touches hands with absence ofinvention, as if that linewhich the human eye will follow with effortless delight were a line that had notbeen invented but simplydiscovered, had in the beginning been hidden by nature and in the end been foundby the engineer. 703The machine was beautiful, impressive, and fascinating - but it was alsosomewhat frightening. It wasan unknown quantity. It seemed to be taking humanity into an entirely differentworld from that which hadpreviously existed. Books and films such as Metropolis [Chapter #23] raised thespectre of man’s losingcontrol of machines and finding himself their servant and victim instead. So ArtDeco was not just anattempt at incorporating the machine into art, but also a means of reassuringmankind that machines couldbe reduced to decorations and playthings at will.Art Deco is thus a blend of exotic, mysterious antiquity and the image of themachine. When humanfigures appear, they are similarly mysterious, exotic, and streamlined machines.As if this is not enough, they are also oddly cold and de-sexed as well. The1920s was a period offlourishing homosexuality among both sexes, caused in major part by the relativesundering of males andfemales by World War I and the war’s toll of many millions of male lives. Menhad spent years largely inthe company of other men, while many women now had no chance of getting husbandseven had allsurviving males been interested. This plight was reflected, perhaps, in the“bobbed” hairstyles and flat-chested fashions of the 1920’s - and in the “unisexualization” of Art Deco.All of which is to say that Art Deco is beautiful, cold, streamlined, and weird.At first glance it appears pretty, but there is also something disturbing aboutit. Like the robotrix inMetropolis, it suggests something subliminally sinister, something vaguelyabnormal - as though it is notnow dangerous but will be if left to develop long enough.There is a touch of the psychotic about it, as though it represents a view ofthe world seen through theeyes of someone who took hallucinogenic drugs while standing in the middle of a1920s’ airplane factory.Nowhere is this peculiar atmosphere of the art form better exemplified than inthe two Dr. Phibes films,where the Abominable Anton constantly surrounds himself with a phantasmagoria ofArt Deco artifacts.As Dr. Phibes communed passionately and devotedly with his dead Victoria, so didDr. LaVey with thedead Marilyn Monroe. His success with necromantic rituals directed towards her,as recounted in Chapter#25, increased his interest in Hollywood - not as a city or an industry, but asan ECI medium for “cryonicfreezing” of the life-force.In “The Secrets of Life and Death” (Appendix #76), I discussed the surrogateimmortality that “thegreat record book” of films appears to impart to stars. Though long dead, theycan be brought to “life”again - like Anton’s androids as often as desired and in modes of behavior mostpleasing.As with Art Deco, however, Hollywood is tinged with the macabre and thegrotesque. Its artificiality,corruption, and fickleness are legendary; yet it seems oddly to thrive on thislegacy. Film stars who liveand die amidst crisis, tragedy, scandal, and horror have greater followings thanthose who lead respectableand unremarkable lives off-screen. Had Marilyn Monroe aged comfortably and diedin her sleepsurrounded by friends, it is doubtful she would attract the following she hasgained through a deathshrouded in mystery, murder, and high-level scandal. Perhaps, Anton LaVey mayhave thought, survival ofthe consciousness past physical death may be stimulated through violent,traumatic, or otherwiseunwilling biological death.In 1974 he assisted one of his original Warlocks - now an “underground Priest” -Kenneth Anger withAnger’s chronicle of Hollywood’s scandals during the first half of the 20thcentury, Hollywood Babylon. Itis difficult to convey some idea of just how gloatingly decadent this book is;one can only acknowledge itas the standard in this peculiar field. To really understand “Hollywood” asAnton LaVey saw it to be, onemust first experience Hollywood Babylon. 704703 Antoine de Saint-Exupery in Hiller, Bevis, The World of Art Deco. New York:E.P. Dutton, 1971, page #33.704 Anger, Kenneth, Hollywood Babylon. San Francisco: Straight Arrow Books,1975.- 391 -Hollywood, like many another drug, is both compulsive and habit-forming. Likethe Lorelei, it drawspeople with its song, only to laugh at them - or, even worse, ignore them - asthey crash to death on itsrocks. World-famed Hollywood Boulevard is well subtitled “the boulevard ofbroken dreams”; and on hisorgan Anton LaVey would regularly play the Kinks’ “Celluloid Heroes” song:And those who are successfulBe always on your guard,For success walks hand-in-hand with failureAlong Hollywood Boulevard. 705During his Satanic career, Anton had occasionally sampled the song of theLorelei. He had playedcameo roles in the Lancer television series and in Kenneth Anger’s Invocation ofmy Demon Brother, andhad of course been the subject of numerous occult-subculture documentaries,including Satanis. He knewhow it felt to see himself on screen, and he had won enough fame/notoriety inthe public eye to make himacceptable and even sought-after company of certain Tinsel-Town celebrities suchas Jayne Mansfield,Sally Struthers, Elke Sommer, and of course Sammy Davis, Jr. It is not hard tosee how he would come toprefer such exotic socializing to the aggravations of overseeing the growingpains of the Church of Satan.If I can make this case with any credibility, it is because I myself had atleast a whiff of the same drug.My encounters with Sammy Davis, as recounted in Chapter #24, had the initialeffect of dazzling me likethe most adolescent “groupie”. I was flattered by Sammy’s friendship; I wantedmore of it; I felt “letdown” when I had to depart for the ordinary world outside after spending anevening with him. Afterawhile I managed to “withdraw” and regain a sense of perspective, but even todayI am surprised at thepsychological power of the experience. How much more it must have been for AntonLaVey, who was farmore deeply involved with Hollywood society.Then in late 1974 Anton LaVey finally “mainlined” Hollywood Babylon. It cameabout as aconsequence of a rather undistinguished witchcraft novel by someone named MaudWillis. The novel wasentitled The Devil’s Rain, and concerned a family’s clash with a reincarnatedNew England witch coven ina small western town.One is almost embarrassed for Willis’ lack of knowledge. For example, sheidentifies the coven’ssacred book as The Hammer, when in fact the actual Malleus Maleficarum was aCatholic church textused to persecute witches. And the ceremonies used by Willis’ coven are the sortof ring-around-the-rosiecounting rhymes that only Raymond Buckland could love. 706The Devil’s Rain would probably have died an early and unnoticed death had notHollywood producerSandy Howard and director Robert Fuest - who coincidentally had directed bothPhibes movies - decidedto make a movie out of it. They further decided to hire the Abominable Dr. LaVeyto revise the script.As can well be imagined, this was rather like inviting Sylvester the cat intoTweety Bird’s cage. Theanemic coven became transformed into the most sinister of Satanic Grottos, thesingsong chants becameblood-and-thunder incantations of sizzling power, and the “witchy” decorationsin the coven’s meetinghall and canyon-hollow metamorphosed into black and silver Satanic Art Deco -with geometrictrapezoids, stylized beast-heads, and fiery Baphomets. By way of illustration,Maud Willis’ canyon-hollowcoven chant is reproduced as Appendix #121, while Anton LaVey’s replacement707[which was also setagainst a towering hillside altar instead of in an enclosed canyon] isreproduced as Appendix #122.The Anton LaVey-revised plot of The Devil’s Rain, as well as background commentson cast and staff,were discussed by Forrest J Ackerman in the October 1975 issue of his FamousMonsters of Filmlandmagazine. Ackerman’s article is reproduced as Appendix #123.705 The Kinks, “Celluloid Heroes”, 1973.706 Willis, Maud, The Devil’s Rain. New York: Dell Publishing Company#440-04553-125, 1975.707 with touches from my own “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” ...- 392 -It will be noted that Forry’s account of Ernest Borgnine’s attitude towardsSatan and Satanism differsfrom that of the Argosy article (Appendix #119). In the first issue of theCloven Hoof that came out afterthe crisis of 1975, Diane [or Anton] commented:Star Ernest Borgnine is not a member of the Church of Satan, but when asked by abevy of reporters -including Argosy’s Dick Russell - whether he would consider being an actual“priest” of Satan, he repliedthat he would accept such an honor if it came from Dr. LaVey, because herespected him as a man. That’s asfar as Mr. Borgnine’s ordination went, though. Many of the performers and creware self-admitted Satanists,several of whom are C/S members of varying degrees, including Director BobFuest. 708The “Director” mentioned in Argosy’s story was not a director, but an inept andarrogant associateproducer who minimized everyone on the set, from Ida Lupino to the Mexicanextras. It was thus acollective “working” that earned the High Priest an opportunity to leave forother Latin Americancommitments a week ahead of completion, with no complaints and fond memories ofDurango. It was at hissuggestion that the film was shot there. 709Having no firsthand experience with the film, I cannot comment as to thecircumstances of Anton’sabrupt departure from Durango. What is certain is that the Devil’s Rain companyknew a good thing whenthey had it; the Anton LaVey designs, scenarios, and dialogue remained intact.Anton himself enjoyed abrief cameo appearance as Borgnine’s chief assistant on the mountainside [hewears a gold helmetconcealing his features], and Diane LaVey - who paid a visit to the set - alsoplayed a cameo role asBorgnine’s wife in the colonial-era coven.The Devil’s Rain did not appear in theaters until a few weeks after the Churchof Satan’s 1975 crisis,so there was little opportunity to discuss it within Church circles. For reasonsunknown to me, it wasreleased in second- or third-rate theaters; in San Francisco, of all places, Ihad to travel to a suburbandrive-in to catch it. In a word it “bombed”, and that was the end of AntonLaVey’s career as a HollywoodSatanist. 710It is difficult to say just why The Devil’s Rain bombed. It had an excellentcast of established actors,and it had the most striking and authentic Satanic ritual sequences ever broughtto the screen. What wentwrong? Most probably inadequate publicity, coupled with a general waning ofpublic interest in Devil-worship themes after several years of Rosemary’s Baby imitations and spin-offs.The public was ready forsomething new and different, which it would get a year later with George Lucas’Star Wars.Despite my admiration for the technical sparkle of The Devil’s Rain, I recallbeing struck by onenegative feature of the film as I sat in the San Pablo Drive-In. The onlySatanist with any character,initiative, power, and vitality was Borgnine himself. All of his followers weremindless robots, waxen-faced zombies711 capable only of carrying candles and chanting. This was not theChurch of Satan; ratherit was the Den of Iniquity - the Phibes Clockwork Wizards in black robes.I couldn’t help contrasting this “Grotto” with the one in Rosemary’s Baby,wherein the Satanists hadall been remarkable for their individual success, intelligence, and prosperity.It is pointless to speculate on how deliberate or accidental this humblingportrayal of Satanists mayhave been, or what role Anton LaVey himself had in that portrayal - other thancoaching the Mexicanextras in their chanting of an Enochian Key. To be sure, Maud Willis’ witcheswere similarly slavish and708 Untrue. The Devil’s Rain was filmed in 1974, and Fuest’s name never appearedin the Church of Satan’s membership records through June1975. Nor did the names of any other cast members or crew.709 LaVey, Anton or Diane, Cloven Hoof #VII-4, July-August X/1975, page #3.710 After many years of absence, The Devil’s Rain is once more available fromVCI Home Video as DVD #8204 (ISBN 1-55739-971-9).Ironically this may be because an obscure extra in the film - John Travolta -later became a major star. His is the only uncostumed photo onthe package!711 including Travolta!- 393 -lifeless. Whatever else Anton’s reworking of the story included, a higherportrayal of the “Grotto” was notone of his concerns.As noted above, The Devil’s Rain did not come out until after the crisis of1975, and everything knownabout the film before then led one to believe that it would be a hit. It seemsreasonable to conclude thatAnton LaVey saw it as a vehicle which would move his “center of gravity” frombeing the leader of adisappointingly imperfect Church of Satan to becoming the czar of Satanism inHollywood films. TheChurch of Satan had enabled him to gain the glamorous image needed to aweHollywood - as is nowherebetter exemplified than by the openmouthed worship of Argosy! But it must haveseemed crucial to Antonto dynamite the Church before word began to seep out of its actual small size,shortcomings, andsicknesses. As Anger’s Hollywood Babylon points out so ominously, becoming alaughingstock in Tinsel-Town can be deadly.One of the illustrations in Hollywood Babylon, a reprint from an old newspaper,is entitled “Trying ‘ToGet There’” - “there” being the “public eye”. On one side of the sketch is arickety bridge labeled“notoriety”, on which crowds of hopefuls are able to manage only a few stepsbefore tumbling down intoa murky valley labeled “disgrace”. On the other side of the sketch is arock-solid path labeled “work”,surmounted by the temples of “popularity”, “fame”, and “renown”.712It takes no great stretch of the imagination to see that, in 1974-75, AntonLaVey made the decision tomove from the rock-solid path to the rickety bridge. This is not to say that hehimself worked any the lessat his personal projects. But what he failed to understand was that what reallymade him consequentialwas not his colorful personality or his creative flair for drama, but hisreputation as High Priest of theChurch of Satan, his preeminence in that “40,000-strong” secret empire ofsorcerers that had Argosy’sreporter shivering in masochistic delight. Without the Church of Satan, AntonLaVey was just one moreoccult Emperor Norton who had written a couple of books. With it, he was asocial force of consequence,to be ignored or challenged at one’s peril.Anton’s alternative would not have been to forego the public eye, but tocontinue to receive it as anoccasional byproduct of executive work with the Church of Satan, work whichitself was largelyunglamorous and unknown outside of the more exclusive circles of thatinstitution - meaning, bluntly,Diane, John Ferro, a few intimate friends and 6114 assistants, and myself.Moreover both Anton and the public were tiring of “stuffed rats and tombstones”publicity. Heprobably felt that he would either have to jump now for the brass ring or resignhimself to a gradualdecline in popularity and/or notoriety as the “occult boom” of the latesixties/early seventies faded away.So Anton LaVey decided to cut his grass roots out from under him. Many of thoseroots were asuseless and as parasitical as he had occasionally complained; he had allowedmuch deadwood to remainon the general membership roster or to subscribe to the Cloven Hoof simply tobring in revenue for theChurch, to publicize it, and to lend as much credibility as possible to itsclaims of size.But, ironically enough, it was not this deadwood that he decided to remove in1975. It could still serveas air for the public relations balloon. What Anton wanted rather to do was torid himself of the talkative,active, semi-competent middle-level of membership - those who were interested inworking with theChurch, but who were too inexperienced or incompetent to reflect positively onit should they be seen bythe outside world. The aforementioned inner elite, on the other hand, wouldremain - and would beexpected to understand, approve of, and aid Anton in his plans to “phase out themiddle class”.The result would be a Church of Satan which would be run for the benefit of thevery few at the top,with the large “lower class” being isolated, inconsequential, and impotent - inshort, a state of affairs verymuch like that in conventional religious institutions.A final piece to the puzzle of Anton LaVey in 1974 came in the form of apaperback book entitled TheDevil’s Avenger: A Biography of Anton Szandor LaVey by Burton H. Wolfe. And thisbook has its ownpeculiar history:712 Cartoon in Anger, op. cit. , pages #130-131.- 394 -Burton Wolfe is a freelance writer, generally of the sort of sensationalisticarticles which appear inmen’s magazines. He had written about hippies and bikers, and had authored theintroduction for theoriginal edition of the Satanic Bible in 1969. He was a friend of the LaVeys buthad never joined theChurch of Satan itself.In early 1974, while I was visiting San Francisco, Anton and Diane LaVey gave mea manuscript typedon yellow paper. It was, they said, a draft for a biography of Anton by Burton.I reviewed it, annotatedsome comments, and asked my mother to run her eye over it as well. Neither of uswas especiallyimpressed with it; it was more or less an expansion of the kind of lions/Mansfield/“stuffed rats &tombstones” profile which by now had been done to death in newspaper andmagazine accounts. [One canget the flavor of Wolfe’s writing by sampling either of his two introductions tothe Satanic Bible, or hisarticle on Anton LaVey in the May 1978 issue of Fling, a pornographic magazinefeaturing women withhuge breasts.]The Devil’s Avenger next came to my attention when a flyer for it (Appendix#124) was inserted in theOctober 1974 Cloven Hoof. I ordered a copy, and the first surprise was that itwas totally unlike themanuscript I had read. In fact it sounded less like Burton Wolfe than like AntonLaVey himself. To theLaVeys I wrote:You know something? Although Dr. LaVey swore up and down that the two of youdidn’t ghostwritethe book, the more I read it, the more it suggests the LaVey style. It’s notjust a corrected version of thatyellow-paper manuscript that Burton first brought ’round; it’s a totallydifferent book.Moreover I’ve been reading letters and texts from both of you for about sixyears now, and yourvocabulary, syntax, etc. stick out like a sore thumb. Finally there are passagesand passages in the bookwhich would be virtually impossible for a third person to relate to sointimately. Well? 713My suspicions were not confirmed by Anton or Diane, but neither were theydispelled, and today Iremain privately convinced that The Devil’s Avenger is an autobiographical workrather than a Wolfe-biography. 714As an auto/biography it deals with Anton’s youth and adolescence, taking himthrough the foundingand early years of the Church of Satan to 1968. A final chapter appears tosummarize events of thesubsequent six years. Since it was precisely the pre-1969 era with which I wasnot personally familiar, Idevoured the story with fascination.One of the first things I noticed was that the language was strangely earthy,even kinky. Words like“sucker” and “screwball” alternated with somewhat obsessive detours into thesexual habits, attributes,and fetishes of an assortment of the Church’s early San Francisco membership.Anton’s own early liferevealed him to have been a precocious introvert who had himself excused fromhigh school sports inorder to spend gym periods “in a special rest room with the other fuckups,flirting with a young nurse whowore short skirts and liked to watch boys undress”. 715Knowing the adult Anton LaVey as well as I did, such anecdotes didn’t tarnish myopinion of him inthe least. In fact I thought it admirable of him to be so honest about hisyouthful failings and faults. Thepoint that I missed was that he didn’t consider them faults at all; in fact hegloried in them.The book contains not one single item critical of Anton; it is rather a 222-pageglorification of hisachievements and rationalization of whatever might not seem to be anachievement.713 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton & Diane LaVey, November 15, IX/1974.714 In a 1/26/2009 letter to me Burton adamantly responded to my suspicions:“Get this straight: Anton did not write one word of The Devil'sAvenger. Nor did he see the book until it was published.” He did not explain theyellow-paper manuscript bearing his name and the book’stitle which the LaVeys gave me to review in advance of publication, nor theextensive portions of the final book which resembled Anton’swriting- and characterizing-style rather than his. Granting that the opening andclosing “overview” chapters resemble Burton’s Satanic Bibleand similar articles, my impression of the rest of the book is unchanged.715 Wolfe, op. cit. , page #27.- 395 -Despite the bias and occasional seaminess of the chapters dealing with AntonLaVey himself, TheDevil’s Avenger might still have had a positive impact if the chapters andanecdotes highlighting the earlymembers of the Church had not been included. Anton himself, whatever hisconstitution, had obviouslyled a fascinating and colorful life.But it was difficult to see the point of seemingly-endless accounts ofhomosexuals thrown out of theArmy for sleeping with pillows between their legs, dildo-manufacturers,mortician’s assistants who fedbutterflies to spiders, and sadistic women who were so mean that they frightenedthe Church’s residentmasochistic men away.Even John Ferro, under the pseudonym of “Gregorio Gionoffrio”, came in for hisshare of degradation.After being praised for his intellect and cultural sophistication, he wasrevealed to be a tormented,frustrated homosexual who would go on “an occasional sex binge during which hefrequented theTenderloin district of San Francisco, picked up several male partners in asingle night, and indulged in themost lurid deviations from accepted American coital practice.” 716 One presumesthat Ferro had notobjected to such an account, but that is not the point. It simply tore him down,as The Devil’s Avengerexposed the weaknesses and inadequacies of every one of Anton’s disciples. Thecurious picture arose of aperfect, infallible leader and a retinue of crippled, inadequate freaks.At the time it didn’t seem especially significant to me that I myself was notmentioned in the book. Ihad never met Wolfe, and of course I had not joined the Church of Satan untilthe year after the majorportion of this biography ended. Still the “1968-74” chapter at the end made nomention of me, nor of anyof the nationwide Priesthood or Grottos. Wolfe had held the Church of Satan’sdirty underwear up for theworld to see, but he had said nothing about the distinguished attire that it hadearned for itself later on.I was of the opinion that the contemporary Church could take care of its ownreputation, but otherSatanists weren’t at all certain they saw it that way. In November 1974 PriestMichael McQuown of theLilith Grotto wrote to me:I saw The Devil’s Avenger in galley form and had very mixed feelings about it.Judy [McQuown] wasdoing a lot of work for Pyramid at that time, so she got to bring the thinghome. There were a couple ofpoints we queried, and the artwork for the cover had gotten rearranged.Apparently Stuart [Levine] had alsoseen the proofs through separate contacts.By and large I thought it was a “fun” sort of book, but I am not especiallyimpressed with Burton Wolfeas a writer. Neither is Pyramid; he apparently tried to screw them over makingrevisions after the thing wasin galley form. I’m not terribly sure I want to be associated with cannibalism.Once the book gets some sortof press, maybe some ersatz official of the Church should denounce it, thusgenerating more interest. 717I responded a month later:To date I’ve received comments on The Devil’s Avenger from about 15 people, somewho know Dr.LaVey personally and some who don’t. On the whole the reaction has been veryfavorable. Everyone’s"},{"pageContent":"immediate comment is that the book is very entertaining. This is obvious; Dr.LaVey has had a very colorfulhistory. The book makes the reader sit up and take notice of him as aninteresting individual.What I will want to see is whether Anton LaVey the philosopher is overshadowedby Anton LaVey theshowman. Underneath all the razzamatazz of the Church is a system of metaphysicsthat is the mostpowerful philosophy to hit this planet since Sartre and the existentialism ofthe mid-century. This is whatmakes Anton LaVey a true Magus in the highest sense of the concept, not that heshaved his head andcursed Sam Brody. He has said this himself, again and again: “Nothing is asstrong as an idea whose timehas come ’round.” The idea is what will make him immortal.716 Ibid., page #110.717 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, November 18, IX/1974.- 396 -I am impressed with the degree of the insight and empathy that Wolfe displays inthe book. He does agood job of explaining the motives behind many of Dr. LaVey’s seemingly-madpranks. He also gives thereader a good idea of the many strata of society which the Church of Satan haspenetrated. These facetsmake the book well worthwhile.The book will also benefit many Satanists who, being residents of far-flunglocales, have had scantmeans to catch the “flavor” of the original Church of Satan. Remember that thevast majority of Satanistshave never come into contact with a Grotto, much less Dr. LaVey and the CentralGrotto.The only question in my mind is the disclaimer contained in the last chapter.I’m not certain whether ithelps or hinders the impact of the book. In one sense it is beside the point.Whether or not Burton Wolfecarries a red card is unimportant. The book makes it obvious that he is a verygood friend of the Devil’sAvenger. He would have had to be to compile so many intimate facts about him.Hence the disclaimercomes across rather transparent, at least to me. After writing a book idolizingsomeone to the skies, youdon’t turn around in the last chapter and say “Nevertheless I can’t buy it.”.Don’t worry about the cannibalism. You aren’t associated with it unless you werethere at 6114munching on a big toe or something.For that matter, what’s so terrible about cannibalism? Is it better that otheranimals are slaughtered toassuage man’s lust for meat? Steaks and pork chops look pretty placid, wrappedup in clear plastic andsitting in the supermarket. But if you want to see endless agony, visit theinside of a commercialslaughterhouse sometime. I have, and I had nightmares for months.This was not the case in Vietnam, where I saw many people killed in front of me.What is horrible is theagony of a trusting, dumb beast that cannot understand why its human “protector”is suddenly killing it.And the animals don’t always die instantaneously, as most people prefer tobelieve.Yet I eat steak because I am a natural carnivore. To abstain as a “protest”would be futile; it would notsave a single steer. Rather the steer would die for no reason at all, whichwould be worse. It would be killedfor economic reasons even if none of its meat should happen to be sold.So cannibalism doesn’t bother me one whit. Nor would it you, I think, if themeat were butchered into asufficiently anonymous form. I doubt that you could tell a human steak from arack of lamb, either by looksor by taste. Want me to prove it? Here’s a magical experiment for you and Judy:Cook up leg-of-lamb some evening, using some unusual seasonings of the sort thatDiane LaVeyemployed. Invite a Satanist and a fairly-trusted non-Satanist over for dinner.After they have eaten, tell themin “all seriousness” that they have just eaten roast human. Work out a goodstory about where you acquiredit. See how they react. Once they are convinced, tell them the truth. If theyare not quite convinced, let ’emfret it out for a day or two. Caution: Keep the sales receipt and packaging forthe lamb on hand in case youhave to prove it was lamb! Let me know how it turns out.But you shouldn’t have to worry about exposure. To tell the story, your guestswould have to mentionthat they had partaken of the “human flesh” - which I rather doubt that they’ddo!718And to Burton Wolfe himself I wrote:The Devil’s Avenger is so comprehensive a portrait of Anton LaVey that I couldhardly believe he didn’tdo it himself. But both he and Diane swear up and down that it’s a Wolfe inWolfe’s clothing. And in myopinion that makes you downright uncanny as a biographer.Mary Every of the Santa Barbara News-Press adds something else. I had given hera copy forbackground while she was preparing for a recent interview with Dr. LaVey. Thefollowing morning shecalled me to say that, while her original intent had been to skim through thebook, she had become sointerested that she had stayed up half the night reading it in its entirety. Shethinks your writing style isextraordinarily readable, and I took that as sound judgment from a professionaljournalist.Another thing that makes the book all the more interesting to me is that itcovers the period before Imyself was associated with the Church. I joined in March IV/1969, and it was atabout that point that theorganization began to metamorphose into a nationally-oriented format. While Iwas able to participate insome of the last of the old Central Grotto ritual activities, I suppose that Iam largely a “second-stage”718 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael McQuown, December 12, IX/1974.- 397 -Satanist. It is fascinating to read such a detailed account of the “OldBolsheviks”. Damn good book. I meanit. 719Burton responded:It’s gratifying to get such a letter under any circumstances, and especiallywith so much in it that isflattering. Writers often feel that they are trying to communicate into a vastvoid because there is so littlefeedback. It’s a kick for me to hear from someone intelligent and intelligiblewho has not only read the bookand reacted to it, but done something about his reaction.Many, many thanks for giving the book to Mary Every, which resulted in animportant review. Manythanks also for buying extra copies of the book and passing them around - not somuch for all the profitsthis puts in my pocket (9 cents a copy), but rather for the value it may have inreaching more people withAnton’s worthwhile story and philosophies.720Little else was said about The Devil’s Avenger. Those who liked it, liked itbecause its negative pointswere superseded by the Anton LaVey and Church of Satan known to them personally.Those who didn’tlike it, didn’t like it because it showed them an ugly Anton LaVey and an uglyChurch of Satan they hadnever supposed to exist. The only consolation was that “those things are in thedistant past, and we’re notlike that now”.Particularly to the Church membership outside of San Francisco, the person ofAnton LaVey hadassumed idealistic proportions. He was known only by news coverage, usually ofthe semi-awestruck typeexemplified by Argosy, and by his imposing photographs on the jackets of hisbooks. The Devil’s Avengershattered the myth of Anton LaVey the demigod, replacing it with Anton LaVey theinteresting yet flawedhuman being. Thus it ultimately had just the opposite of the effect it hadpresumably been written to exert.And the “1969-74” concluding chapter, in addition to its conspicuous exclusionof the Church’snational growth and accomplishments, compounded the error by a series of liesand exaggerations.TDA claimed 25,000 members for the Church and an “affiliated following in excessof two million”. 721Anton was awarded “two huge homes in Sonoma County and the hills of Hollywood”,as well as “accessto estates” around the world [including Santa Barbara].722 There was even aSatanic Navy: Jim Moodywas said to have “placed three oceangoing salvage ships at the disposal of Antonand his Church”. 723Almost every book, film, rock song, and comic book having anything remotely todo with the Devil wasclaimed to be Anton-inspired, and 6114 California Street was transformed into afortress to rival FortKnox. As much as the Church of Satan admired its founder and leader, it allseemed just a bit much.The Devil’s Avenger, like The Devil’s Rain, died a surprisingly quick death. Itsfirst printing was alsoits last, and within six months it could no longer be found in bookstores.Again, I might add, this was veryperplexing to me. 724 Whether or not the book told the story of Anton and theChurch of Satan in the bestpossible way, the story which it did tell seemed as though it should beextraordinarily interesting to the719 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Burton Wolfe, December 10, IX/1974.720 Letter, Burton Wolfe to M.A. Aquino, December 16, IX/1974.721 Wolfe, op. cit. , page #212.722 Ibid.723 Ibid., page #213.724 In his 2008 Introduction to The Black Pope, Burton says that there was an[apparently nationwide] threat of boycott by Christian groupsagainst any bookstore that dared to carry TDA, forcing frightened retailers toreturn all copies to Pyramid Books, which burned them. Thismakes no sense in a market in which the Satanic Bible, Compleat Witch, andSatanic Rituals had been selling openly and peacefully for years.More probably TDA just bumped up against the same theme-oversaturation thatflopped The Devil’s Rain. A decade earlier, at the time ofRosemary’s Baby, TDA would have sold like hotcakes.- 398 -general public. Apparently I didn’t understand popular tastes, but then I haverarely scored very high inthat game.In 2008 Burton extensively revised The Devil’s Avenger into an ebook editionentitled The BlackPope. 725 In his new Introduction he comments concerning the 1974 TDA:To my shame, in writing the book I committed one of the cardinal sins that allbiographers, journalists,and writers of any sort are compelled to avoid: I became too close to mysubject. The result was that afterchecking the first round of stories Anton told me, those that were used formagazine and newspaper articles,I stopped taking steps to make sure he was not inventing or embellishingepisodes in his life, and I repeatedsome of his inventions.This is not to say that my 1974 biography of Anton contains more of hisinventions than fact. To thecontrary, more of what he told me is true than untrue, and then there are thesubstantial parts of the bookcontaining what I myself observed and my talks with Church of Satan warlocks andwitches and others whohobnobbed with Anton. Those parts of the book are reliable. But there are toomany stories in The Devil’sAvenger that contain Anton’s fabrications. 726As I said to Burton when he sent me a copy of TBP, I don’t think he has anyreason whatever to feelashamed about TDA. In 1968 and 1974 he was interacting with Anton LaVey as apersonal friend, not as adisinterested biographical or historical researcher. He took what Anton andDiane said on the unsuspicioustrust of this friendship, just as I did during my own 1969-75 close acquaintancewith them. Both COS andTBP disclose facts which only later came to light. But even these must be viewedin careful context. It isone thing, for example, to say that Anton or Diane created fantasies toglamorize themselves, impress theirfriends, and entertain the public. That is quite different from accusing them ofbeing malicious, predatoryliars and con-artists. I am quite sure that Burton and I, while havingexperienced the former moreextensively and intensely than most of the LaVeys’ intimates, wouldunhesitatingly reject the latter.While The Black Pope corrects many of the falsehoods of The Devil’s Avenger, itdoggedly clings toother contentions (such as Anton’s claimed dalliance with Marilyn Monroe) whichI do not find credible.While writing TBP Burton exchanged several eletters with me in which we candidlydiscussed ourrespective interpretations of and conclusions concerning various episodes.Suffice it to say here thatBurton considered COS (6th Edition) when writing TBP, while I considered TBPwhen updating COS tothis 7th Edition. Beyond that, readers of both volumes are invited to make uptheir own minds regardingany still-smoldering differences.727The picture I have painted in this chapter has been one of a man whose interestsand ideals hadbecome so bizarre as to be nigh incomprehensible to the institution he headed.While Priests, RegionalAgents, and Grottos talked of Satanism in the language and context of theSatanic Bible, Anton SzandorLaVey had long since departed that realm for the Art Deco fantasia of Dr.Phibes. The comfortable, affablesocial philosopher shown in Satanis had given way to the reclusive, wistfulRotwang of Argosy. It wasnow but a question of time before the dynamics of the Church and those of itsHigh Priest would finallycollide.725 The Black Pope may be purchased online at Burton Wolfe’s website:http://mindopeningbooks2.com [http://mindopeningbooks2.com]/726 Wolfe, Burton H., The Black Pope (ebook, 2008), Introduction.727 Burton and I would probably be willing to argue about Anton and Marilyn on atelevision talk show, but only if both of us were paid avery large amount of money to do so.[index-399_1.jpg]- 399 -BRUTUS: Romans, countrymen, and lovers!

It would be thehalfway point in the eighteen-year Working commenced in I/1966, and in theSatanic Rituals Anton hadwritten that “each midway point between the Working Years displays a zenith ofintensity for the Workingwhich has been brought about”. 728 As it turned out, those would be veryprophetic words indeed - but in away that neither Anton LaVey nor anyone else could possibly have anticipated.Early in January I once more revived the long-dormant Chronicles of Mendes.Since the new Phasewould not be generating much information for the general membership of theChurch, it seemed to me thatincreased information should be provided the Priesthood. It further seemedappropriate that the Chroniclesshould recommence with a very clear statement concerning the implications of theSatanic Priesthooditself. Issue #II-1 (Appendix #125) was therefore written, approved by theLaVeys, and sent out. Reactionsto the issue were most encouraging:Concerning the Chronicles of Mendes … Wow! Before I make any comments on it, Iwant to read it afew more times. Fantastic!Robert Ethel729728 LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Rituals, page #219.729 Letter, Robert Ethel to M.A. Aquino, January 27, X/1975.- 400 -Chronicles of Mendes: I am not sure at this point what would be most desirable.Perhaps a moresophisticated reading list, some expansions on material in the Hoof, discussionon useful ideas andconcepts. I hope to get a lot of good stuff out of my Religion and Psychologycourse which might be goodfor dealing with certain types of argument, for instance. I would like to seethe communication networkamong the Order expanded, particularly from the point of view of getting headstogether with Priestsinterested in similar or different approaches. Where it is feasible, or where aPriest is “above ground”, Iwould like to see the free interchange of ideas, assessments of the temper oftheir working areas, etc.,because I think there are specific regional differences in attitude and outlook.It might be useful tounderstand these things.Cloven Hoof: I put the question to Lilith Grotto members last meeting, and I amwaiting for feedback.For my part I would like to see it larger and dealing with some of the materialit used to - stuff like Ponape,the Chinese Satanists, anything of the far-ranging, wider scope that it used tohave.

I amconvinced, however, that inthe next decade or so they will be forced to reevaluate their “evolution”. Icertainly hope I’m right.Robert J. DeCecco731Later in January Lilith Sinclair and I finally took Dale Seago on his firstvisit to 6114 California Street,at whose marvels he was predictably impressed. Unfortunately he - and Lilith andI - were also somewhattaken aback when the LaVeys’ chauffeur, Tony Fazzini, walked into the PurpleRoom sporting the bluemedallion of a Magister IV°.Tony had been “around” 6114 for some years - a pleasant, quiet, somewhat stockyfellow who seemedcontent to sit in the front hall and read magazines whenever he wasn’t pilotingAnton or Diane somewherein the black Buick Limited.Diane and I good-humoredly referred to him as “Lurch”, after the gaunt butler inthe Addams Familytelevision series. His interest was obviously in the LaVeys themselves; he hadnever interacted with therest of the Church, let alone undertaken the initiatory path to the SatanicPriesthood that the rest of us hadtread. Hence it was surprising - to say the least - to see him formally elevatedabove the III° Priesthood.As soon as the three of us left 6114, two pairs of questioning eyes were turnedin my direction. Ihardly knew what to say. I myself had known nothing of Tony’s IV°, nor anythingof whatever he mighthave done to qualify him for this degree in Anton LaVey’s judgment. All I couldsay was that I trusted thatjudgment, and that Tony must have deserved it. Since Lilith and Dale had alsotrusted Anton’s judgmentfor many years, they nodded pro forma acceptance.But it left all three of us uneasy nevertheless. The unspoken objection was thatwe knew damn wellthat Tony Fazzini was not qualified to be a Satanic Priest, let alone aMagister. He might be a nice fellowand household aide, but the Priesthood called for the kind of acumen andaccomplishments exemplified inall those who held the title across the continent.730 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, February 13, X/1975.731 Letter, Robert DeCecco to M.A. Aquino, recd. February 1, X/1975.- 401 -But there was nothing to be done, so by tacit agreement we swept Tony under therug. He wascertainly not causing any problems. And it was possible that he did have someclandestine qualitiesdeserving of the IV°. If so, we would no doubt see them displayed sooner orlater.If Anton LaVey had heaped honors upon Lurch, he had just as determinedly ignoreda fledgling Grottoforming in his own city. In Greenwich Village the elitism of “The Magician” hadproved to be itsAchilles’ heel; the merchandise that it stocked was too expensive and toospecialized for the sort of personwho could be expected to walk in off the street.Ronald Barrett decided to phase the operation into a nationwide mail-orderservice, hoping to attractand maintain the necessary clientele from a broader base. In February of IX/1974he left New York Cityfor San Francisco to set up a commercial outlet there. 732 The rescue attemptwas a little too late, however,and in April Barrett’s partner, William Andrews, found it necessary to close theGreenwich Village storeentirely. 733In San Francisco Barrett continued his efforts to preserve the mail-order sideof “The Magician”. InAugust IX/1974 he was invited to 6114 California Street to show his selection ofsilver jewelry to Anton,and he quoted his normal retail prices less the 9% discount that “The Magician”had always offered toChurch of Satan members. There was an awkward pause in the conversation. TheHigh Priest, Barrett wasinformed, was accustomed to paying wholesale prices only. Greatly embarrassed,Barrett concluded thesale of a number of his only samples at wholesale, virtually eliminating anyprofit to his strugglingenterprise, and departed. 734The LaVeys decided that they didn’t want to see any more of Ronald Barrett. Theydisapproved myrecommendation that he be sent the III° examination, and they remarked to methat they had received acomplaint from Satanist Robert Gibson that he had been financially victimized byBarrett and Andrewswhen “The Magician” was first set up as a corporation.Once again Barrett was astonished and mortified. He sent me copies of thecomplete financial recordsof “The Magician”, together with an account of the fully-disclosed business riskthat Gibson hadundertaken. The books and papers exonerated Barrett, and I so advised theLaVeys, but it appeared that hewas nonetheless persona non grata at 6114 California Street.Nevertheless Ronald Barrett carried on, I presume encouraged in part by mysupport of and confidencein him. In February X/1975 he wrote:It’s been so long since I last wrote you that I do not remember if I told youabout my land. I purchasedtwenty acres of mountain property in Mendocino County near Ukiah. The villagenearest me is PotterValley. I am delighted with the land, as it is very remote, literally coveredwith wildlife, and on top of amountain. I shall be building a stone house on the site after the rain season,and I have great magicalambitions for the property, i.e. an outdoor temple, stone altar, etc. I would bedelighted to have you“experience” a visit to it someday, as I’m certain you would appreciate theincredible feelings the landevokes.I have two friends, one of whom is my roommate, who have been accepted into theChurch of Satan.We are meeting on Friday evenings and are building the foundation of what wehope will be a Grotto. Thename I have selected for it is “Twilight Grotto”. I realize we cannot functionas openly in this area as theLilith Grotto does back east. Nonetheless we wish to be active as a group, evenif only behind closed doors.Both Mr. Zappitelli and Mr. Brink are assets, in my opinion, to the Age ofSatan. We are interested inhaving other members in the area who might be interested in group study andritual work contact us. Anyideas and information on forming a Grotto which you might send would be verymuch appreciated.735732 Letter, Lilith Sinclair to M.A. Aquino, February 21, IX/1974.733 Letter, William Andrews to M.A. Aquino, April 25, IX/1974.734 Letters, M.A. Aquino to Ronald Barrett, August 24, IX/1974; Ronald Barrettto M.A. Aquino, August 27, IX/1974.735 Letter, Ronald Barrett to M.A. Aquino, February 9, X/1975.- 402 -I responded:As far as your word is concerned, I would not have recommended you for thePriesthood of Mendes -as I did - if I did not believe you a man of honor. I see no reason to alter myopinion. Or myrecommendation.Your plot of land sounds good. There is something about owning a piece of Terra,isn’t there? Theterritorial imperative or something like that. I think it was a good idea,particularly in light of the ambitionsyou have for it. I would very much like to see it when and if the opportunitypresents itself.Under the provisions of the current Phase of the Church of Satan’s Master Plan,any II° Satanist whodesires to form a Grotto may do so - clandestine or aboveground. You are free topromote and operate theTwilight Grotto as you deem fit. You have the Satanic Bible and Satanic Ritualsas basic reference works,and - from your long tenure in the Lilith Grotto - you know what sort ofactivities a Grotto may successfullyundertake. Feel welcome to contact me if you encounter any “extraordinary”problems.When you plan both your personal future and your goals as a Grotto Leader, donot ever forget that youhave taken it upon yourself to be more than a man. The aspirations of a Satanistmust remain exalted,because the ArchDæmon himself is the antithesis of inertia and mediocrity. Letus consider a passage fromLoren Eiseley’s The Night Country:“Man is not man. He is elsewhere. There is within us only that dark, divineanimal engaged in a strangejourney - that creature who, at midnight, knows its own ghostliness and sensesits far road. ‘Man’sunhappiness,’ brooded Thomas Carlyle, ‘comes of his Greatness; it is becausethere is an Infinite in him,which with all his cunning he cannot quite bring under the Finite.’ This is whyhydrogen, which has becomethe demon element of our time, should be seen as the intangible dagger whichhung before Macbeth’svision, but which had no power except what was lent to it by his own mind.“The terror that confronts our age is our own conception of ourselves. Above allelse this is the potionwhich the modern Dr. Jekylls have concocted. As Shakespeare foresaw: ‘It hathbeen taught us from theprimal state, That he which is was wished until he were.’ This is not the voiceof the witches. It is the clearvoice of a great poet almost four centuries gone, who saw at the dawn of thescientific age what was to bethe darkest problem of man: his conception of himself. The words are quiet,almost cryptic; they do notforetell. They imply a problem in free will. Shakespeare, in this passage, saysnothing of starry influences,machinery, beakers, or potions. He says, in essence, one thing only: that whatwe wish will come.“I submit that this is the deadliest message man will ever encounter in allliterature. It thrusts upon himinescapable choices. Shakespeare’s is the eternal, the true voice of the divineanimal, piercing, as it hasalways pierced, the complacency of little centuries in which, encamped as inhidden thickets, men havesought to evade self-knowledge by describing themselves as men.” 736When I returned from Santa Barbara after meeting “Magister Fazzini” in SanFrancisco, a differentsort of problem awaited me in my mailbox - this time from the Lilith Grotto inNew York. It seemed that aveteran I° of the Church of Satan’s first years in San Francisco namedAlessandra Erb had moved east andhad made contact with the Lilith Grotto. It was not a fruitful contact, asMichael McQuown now related:Van Ness told me that Erb claims to (a) have used heroin while functioning as analtar at the CentralGrotto, and (b) have baby-sat the LaVey children. My general impression of heris that she is as neurotic asall get-out. The only time she bothered to show up at a Grotto meeting here, allshe did was to look downher nose at everybody and say that “they didn’t do it like that at Central” -quite contrary to Karla LaVey’scomment that we work very much like Central. Oh, well. 737McQuown had made one more attempt to establish rapport with Erb:736 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Ronald Barrett, February 19, X/1975.737 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, January 20, X/1975.- 403 -At that time it did not seem likely that Van Ness would be activelyparticipating in Grotto activities, so Idecided to see if Ms. Erb would be inclined in that direction. I decided tosound her out. In talking to her onthe telephone, I got a very snide, supercilious reaction, including anaccusation that I had been “put up” tocalling her. After terminating the conversation, I decided not to bothernotifying her of meetings, becauseher attitude was totally negative. So I let the matter drop. 738Had Erb passed out of the orbit of the Lilith Grotto, nothing would have come ofit. But she had the[mis]fortune to take a fancy to Jay Solomon, a volatile individual who had beenexpelled from the Grottoand the Church for boorish and vulgar slander directed against Lilith Sinclair,Warlock Van Ness, othermembers of the Grotto, and ultimately myself [when I intervened to try toresolve the disagreement]. NowMichael McQuown had accidentally encountered Erb, in Solomon’s company, at aconvention. Aware thatthe Church of Satan’s standing policy forbade members’ social contact withexpelled members, McQuownadvised me of his intentions:As a matter of form I will notify Ms. Erb that she is treading on murky groundvis-a-vis hermembership, and see if she bothers to reply. If I don’t hear from her by the endof the month, I will assumethat she doesn’t give a damn and will recommend the suspension of hermembership. 739Alessandra Erb ignored the warning, but back from Jay Solomon came letterswarning him of the mostdire consequences [including the ire of Magister Aquino!] should he concernhimself further with Erb.McQuown duly recommended Erb’s expulsion to me, citing somewhat blandly Erb’swielding of her“6114 connection”:In light of the allegations that she has so much pull with the High Priest, I amamazed that my primaryaction in writing to her does not result in all sorts of personal reprimandsfrom his Excellency. Since I amstill alive, however, and since my telephone has not rung itself off the hookwith irate calls from SonomaCounty, I am reasonably sure that common sense will prevail. 740To my utter surprise, Alessandra Erb did appear to benefit from some kind of“double standard”, as acarbon copy of a letter from “Lana Green” to her arrived shortly thereafter inmy mailbox, presumably inresponse to a request by Erb for Anton LaVey’s sanction. Diane LaVey had writtento Erb:We regret that there has been an unpleasant exchange between Reverend McQuown,yourself, and otherparties. Since both, or should we say all sides of the story appear sincere,albeit conflicting, we can onlyassume there have been misunderstandings which are open to personalinterpretation.First we wish to assure you that you are still considered a member in goodstanding. I have spoken withDr. LaVey about the matter, and he said that he certainly does recall the manyservices you performed forthe Church in its formative years, and that he will always consider you one ofhis “special CompleatWitches”.We trust that any personal animosities between our official, Rev. McQuown, andyourself will ease withtime. He too has served the Church well, and we know he was only acting in whathe considered theChurch’s best interests. Mr. Solomon has seemingly had several personaldifficulties, with both friends andChurch members/officials. We hold no malice against him, and trust he will oneday come to grips with histrue feelings. We trust your judgment where Mr. Solomon is concerned. 741738 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, February 13, X/1975.739 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, January 20, X/1975.740 Letter, Michael McQuown to M.A. Aquino, February 13, X/1975.741 Letter, “Lana Green” (Diane LaVey) to S. Alessandra Erb, February 17,X/1975.- 404 -Across the top of my carbon copy Diane had written “TAKE NO ACTION”. Knowing asshe did howI felt towards affronts to the Priesthood, she doubtless guessed what myreaction would be.She guessed right; I was thoroughly incensed. I could not reverse a decisionthat had obviously beenmade by Anton LaVey himself, but I could let McQuown know how I felt - and, viaa carbon copy to6114, let the LaVeys know also. To McQuown I said:As a matter of principle I have no tolerance at all for any Satanist who failsto show due respect to anordained Priest or Priestess of Our Lord Satan. Such respect must be bothexplicit (cooperation with theguidance of the III° official) and implicit (trust in the motives behind suchIII° guidance). An insult to or anattack upon a member of Satan’s Priesthood is a direct affront to the ArchDæmon.It is just that simple.After reading your account of Alessandra Erb’s telephone manners, I askedPriestess Sinclair to give meher views. She tells me that Erb sneered at the Lilith Grotto from the time shearrived in New York,evidently believing that her prior attendance at Central Grotto activitiesentitled her to a station above thatof the “peons in the bushes”. It is a common syndrome of all courtiers. Sooneror later Erb will learn thatthe kind of person she is is far more important than whom she knows. 742For good measure I enclosed a reprint of the Church of Satan’s relevant policystatement, which hadbeen published in the Cloven Hoof many years before:Important! To all members:Occasionally it has been brought to the Council’s attention that certainex-members of the Church ofSatan have maintained or attempted to maintain contact with members in goodstanding, while showingdispleasure and/or disdain for the Church, its policies, and its leaders.Any member in good standing who is found to have entertained such relationshipswill be consideredanathema and dealt with accordingly. Such measures are mandatory if our Order isto continue to grow instrength and durability.We must take pride in having what others lack, within our unholy precincts. Wemust maintain a fiercepride in our stations as Satanists and members of the Church of Satan. If onewishes to dance, he must paythe piper; hence ex-members who have been phased out because of inadequacies, orwho have defectedbecause of disgruntlement or lack of commitment, cannot expect to continue toreceive social and emotionalgratification (plus knowledge of Church activities) from those who remaindedicated and capable.Therefore any member who finds himself involved in a relationship with anex-member should be madeaware of the following article of conduct from the Protocols of the Lictors ofthe Order of the Trapezoid,Church of Satan:Edict #8: Any member of the Church of Satan who willingly and with deliberationengages in ormaintains contact with a former member who, because of defection, expulsion, orfor any other reason is nolonger officially recognized as a member of the Church of Satan, shall assumethe position of persona nongrata. Furthermore said existing member, having entered into that whichconstitutes an act of disloyalty tothe Church of Satan, its High Priest, leaders, principles, and policies, shallbe considered anathema and,subject to appeal before the Council of the Trapezoid, presents true and validgrounds for expulsion.743That was the end of the Alessandra Erb affair, and the LaVeys said nothing moreto me about it either.I expect we were all just as happy to set it aside. As an isolated incident itwould have meant very little,but retrospectively I can see it as one more strain on the pleasant andcooperative relationship I hadenjoyed with Anton and Diane LaVey. As with John Ferro’s exchange with “ReverendSeth Typhon”, I hadonce more gone to bat for the sanctity of the Satanic Priesthood beyond anyinterpersonal relationshipsthat might be involved. The Tony Fazzini issue fell into the same category, butso far no word had beensaid about it.742 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Michael McQuown, February 19, X/1975.743 The Cloven Hoof #III-2, page #13.- 405 -It was with some relief that I changed once more from Eliot Ness into a MagisterTempli and headedsouth to Los Angeles to pick up a copy of Meric. Casaubon’s John Dee’s ActionsWith Spirits, which hadjust been reprinted in facsimile from the 1659 edition. Robert Ethel had told meabout this new edition,which contained the Enochian Keys in their apparently original form. [Not forseveral years would I learnthat Casaubon’s Keys were themselves significantly altered from John Dee’soriginal diaries and magicalrecords.]The Casaubon reprint looked just like every magician wants a grimoire to look:big, thick, heavy, andleather-bound. I could hardly wait to “take the original Keys out for a testdrive”, and did so that veryevening at one of the old artillery batteries at Fort MacArthur where I hadconducted many a Call toCthulhu during Army Reserve weekends with the infamous 306th PSYOP Battalion.The result wasnothing short of astonishing. The following day, March 9th, I jotted down theresults:For the first Working I decided to pronounce the 19th Key, invoking ZIM (the13th Æthyr). Cornurequired twice before any response.Then the result: I recall coming, under hazy circumstances, to a largewooden-beamed hall in whichwere seated a number of men around a table. I knew them to be the “SecretChiefs” of the “White” traditionof whom Aleister Crowley and others have spoken.I suggested that I might be allowed to join them, sensing that they did notimmediately perceive myidentity as a Magister Templi of the Left-Hand Path. But there was some dissent,as though some of themwere wary of me.Finally I revealed myself as a Magister Templi. They reacted more negativelythan before, donningrobes of various colors. I responded by donning my own black/blue robe,whereupon there was a reactionby them of even stronger dislike. I responded with anger in turn.There was a violent conflagration, the hall collapsed, and I recall nothingfurther. 744This was no mere dream, since I did not fall asleep, nor was it the type ofhallucination which mayfollow from fatigue, self-hypnosis, or other “bewilderment” to the mind. It wasa rational experience,perfectly clear to my normal senses. It was very “crude”, but then I hardlyexpected anything polished tocome of a first Working with a new magical system. I took no particular meaningfrom the sequence itself;what was significant to me was the sharpness and clarity of the entireexperience - far more so thanWorkings conducted with the Crowley Keys in the Equinox or the LaVey Keys in theSatanic Bible.It was hardly politic to recount something like this to the author of theSatanic Bible, at least not until Ihad explored and understood it better. Robert Ethel, who himself possessed acopy of the Casaubonvolume, would be a more suitable correspondent. Upon returning to Santa BarbaraI wrote him:In case you thought I passed right over your discovery of the Casaubon reprintmentioned in yourDecember letter, I did not. But it has taken me this long to locate a copy,inspect it for accuracy, and formsome preliminary conclusions concerning it.From what I have read in the book so far - coupled with results I have obtainedfrom an experimentaloperation with one of the Keys - it is a tremendously powerful text. The secretto its proper use lies, Ibelieve, in the disassociation of its implications from hybrid/Cabalisticjargon. This includes thepronouncing of the Keys themselves (which, from Mathers’ time onward, have beenspoken per the lettersof the Hebrew alphabet and not according to the simple phonetics implied by eachletter in the text).There are two general points to be considered. The first is that which I broughtout in the “CaucusRace” article in the Hoof, i.e. that Dee, Kelley, and Casaubon would have beenplaying with fire [at thestake] had they not bent over backwards to couch their texts in “good Christian”terminology. [One couldsay much the same for John Milton, whose Paradise Lost is an excellent exampleof such lip service.]The second point is that Dee and Kelley were themselves necessarily of aJudaic/Christian educationalbackground. They would have been inclined to interpret extraordinary contacts inline with the myths and744 Aquino, M.A., Working Record, Enochian Keys, March 9, X/1975.- 406 -legends most familiar to them. In going through this reprint of Casaubon, I haveattempted to evaluate each“Angelic” incident in a more empirical frame of reference. A pattern is emergingthat I find very exciting,but I must proceed further with the correlation before I commit myself toconclusions. 745While Ethel and I were comparing notes about John Dee, Warlock Lynn Norton andWitch ColleenHuddleston had been cooperating on a magical project of their own - the“Satanica Portfolio”. Thiscollection of drawings was advertised throughout the Church by variousnewsletters, and in April Lynnand Colleen sent me a complimentary set of the prints. To Colleen I wrote:A short time ago I received the “Satanica” portfolio compiled by you and WarlockLynn Norton. It isnothing short of magnificent, and I am very grateful to both of you for sendingme the set. Among all thedrawings one of my favorites is that dragon-creature of yours. But then I havelooked at each drawing atlength, attempting to visualize the realities and fantasies symbolized therein.I will keep the portfolio in aspecial place in my study where I may have ready access to it. 746I went on to ask Colleen whether she had had any further thoughts concerning thePriesthood. ThoughI had recommended her and Tom for the Priesthood some time previously, and theLaVeys had beenfavorable, nothing seemed to have come of it. I wasn’t sure where the ball hadbeen dropped. To LynnNorton I also sent a letter:There are a good many frustrations involved with my commitment to the Church ofSatan. I haven’ttaken a real vacation in over five years. I have stayed up night upon nightuntangling a never-ending varietyof things by letter and telephone. The public that dislikes us causes problems,and sometimes the public thatlikes us presents even greater problems. And at any given time there is always aklutz or two in themembership needing either some gentle guidance or [stage two] a good swift kickin the ass.I bring this up because there is something that makes the whole rat raceworthwhile. It is theobservation of that special sort of genius in an individual which, inenvironments other than that created bythe Church of Satan, might never have been brought to flower. Whenever I see it- and it appears in manyguises - I feel just like a cat that has absconded with an entire gallon ofcream. And then all the pettyfrustrations disappear completely. Your portfolio evidences precisely that kindof genius. And I have reasonto believe that it will carry you further than you may now imagine. 747And more good news arrived from Ronald Barrett:We at the Twilight Grotto have been rather busy, and I should like to take sometime to share with yousome of what we have been doing. The Grotto was formally organized on February14. Those attendingwere Mr. Ricco Zappitelli (now the Grotto Scribe) and Mr. Robert Brink (now theGrotto Task Master). Wediscussed our Grotto directions and activities, along with Grotto and Church ofSatan protocol. Also weread and discussed the “Book of Belial” and “Book of Leviathan” from the SatanicBible.Most of our meetings are magical study sessions, and the interest and responseare very good. Thus farour studies have included many of my old copies of the Cloven Hoof, SatanicRituals, Morning of theMagicians, some Lovecraft, and comparative magical systems. Now we are touchingon Egyptology.In one session we were reviewing Dr. LaVey’s Cloven Hoof article “Qualificationsof a Magician”. Thisresulted in an incredibly constructive introspection for all of us. As forGrotto rituals, we have had twocompassion, two destruction, one modified Black Mass, and a specialWalpurgisnacht celebration.Our first open house on March 11, X was attended by two males, one of whom hassubmitted anapplication. We are very anxious for our Grotto to expand, but will not acceptless than our standards of745 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Robert Ethel, March 12, X/1975.746 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Colleen Huddleston, April 21, X/1975.747 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Lynn Norton, April 21, X/1975.- 407 -quality. We are also hoping for some female members, but I think there is ashortage in this area. Our altar isvery bare - but not in the appropriate way!We are an ambitious, small group that is study-conscious and eager to apply whatis learned. We areusing our small numbers to the advantage of quality, so that as we grow, thatsame quality will be ourconstant foundation. I have found what I learned as a previous member of theLilith Grotto invaluable, and Ihave applied much of that knowledge already.As Grotto Leader I am very pleased with both of my members. They are responsive,enthusiastic, andstrong assets. All three of our personalities are totally different from eachother, but so far we seem only tocomplement one another. I’m sure it will be only a short time before both willwant to be tested for the II°.Friday of this week will find the Twilight Grotto heading up to my mountain forthree fantastic days. Ihave staked off the area where I shall start constructing the homesite beforelong. My plans are a self-styledversion of Egyptian architecture, with the main room 45’x18’x9’, and most of itsubterranean. It will beconstructed of cement and stone, hopefully resembling a rock-carven tomb. The45’ front will be facing thedownward slope of the mountain and will be behind two 9’-tall, 18’-basetrapezoidal stone walls, creating afortress effect. Not being an architect or a builder, I am having a difficulttime figuring it all out - but I amenjoying the challenge.Magister Aquino, I would like to say at this time how much I appreciate what youhave done, not onlyfor me personally but also for the Satanic Age. I have met several members ofvarious positions in theChurch of Satan, and have heard only complimentary remarks in reference to you.It gives me a great dealof satisfaction to read your letters and the Cloven Hoof and know that Satanistsare administered by suchcultured and wise leaders as yourself.I want also to commend you for the fairness and expertise in judgment I haveobserved you to exercise.I’m not sure, according to our protocol, exactly how to compliment and thank youfor all you have doneexcept in my own fashion. That is to say: “I think you are a fantastic personand leader, and you haveearned my greatest respect. I thank you as Ron and Warlock Barrett!” Yourefforts are most certainlyrecognized and appreciated.I trust you had a delightful Walpurgisnacht, and hope that the ensuing year isbut a celebration in life foryou. 748On May 20th I paid what would be my last visit to 6114 California Street, todeliver Anton’s birthdaypresent: a heavy bronze short-sword adorned with pleasantly ugly and brutishdæmons. The LaVeys and Ispent a relaxed evening talking about the effects of the current Phase and thestartling amount of mail thathad resulted from my March/April Cloven Hoof article on the Church’s degreesystem (Appendix #126),and Diane cooked “sandwitches” in a special batter she had whipped up. While wemunched them, wechuckled over photographs she had taken of her husband on location with TheDevil’s Rain in Durango. Itwas quite a jump from Casaubon to a photo of Anton trying to get a crowd ofMexican extras to chantEnochian from hastily written “idiot cards”!In early May I wrote to Diane:The sandwitch was so good that I tried my claw at one shortly after returninghome. I hate to tell youthe mess I made of it. Brandy liked it at least! Give me a little more time andabout thirty eggs and I’llbecome an adept. Sometime I must tell you about the first time I tried to roasta turkey. Created somethingvery novel which, for want of a more suitable term, I dubbed “turkey jerky”.Ready for the Hoof and address-input whenever you are. Should be a nice issue. Iam glad that the lastone evoked all that mail. At least people are reading the rag! There seems to beso little reader feedback oneach issue that I have more than occasionally found myself wondering about thenewsletter’s punch.The photos from Mexico were tremendous. There is something very funny aboutAnton LaVey teachingextras via Enochian idiot cards. [What would John Dee think?] Of course I’m onpins & needles waiting to748 Letter, Ronald Barrett to M.A. Aquino, May 22, X/1975.- 408 -see the final Devil’s Rain. Question: Will critics render thunderous acclaim,shower praise upon it, considerit all wet, or write it off as a drop in the bucket? I think they will hail itwith a storm of applause. 749Diane responded:The “sandwitch” appellation reminded me of the fact that, despite my wondrous,glamorous (ahem!)exterior, I really am a cookie-lady type at heart. We too enjoyed your visit,and it couldn’t have been moreappropriately timed, what with all the changes that are about to take place.The magnificent sword has found an ideal setting against the castle-likebackdrop of the rock whichcomprises the main altar/fireplace - not inside, but against it! - at Central.The rock complements the heavydesign of the sword and vice-versa.I’m enclosing Anton’s essay for the Hoof. Also the main body of the leadarticle, in which you’ll givethem the low-down on the attainment of degrees, R.A. contacts, and newsletters,and explain that the articleis intended to answer all the mail we received on the last issue. 750The lead essay she enclosed read as follows [with Diane’s comments before andafter]:[Note: Begin this lead article with a qualifier to the effect that we receivedso much mail on the lastissue - questions on the second and third degrees, how to contact RegionalAgents, how to get the mailingaddress - and costs - of regional newsletters, etc. You know, what you and Antondiscussed when you werehere.You will recall, the following is to be used almost verbatim, any changes makingit stronger ifanything:]* * *“Advancement to Witch or Warlock (II°) is attained by one of two means:appointment or application.One is appointed through recognition of prowess or contribution to the bestinterests of the Church of Satan.In this category are to be found persons recognized as authorities or leaders intheir fields. Their recognitionmust exceed self-evaluation and be evidenced by popular acclaim or public notice(via media) of theirachievements. In short, persons of note whose affiliation with the Church canexert a strong influence overothers, either publicly or among their peers. This prerequisite applies to theIII° as well.“Also eligible for advancement through appointment are those who have made atangible and viablecontribution to the expansion and development of the Church. This does not applyon a Grotto or regionallevel, for each member so involved is expected to share in the operation of anysocial faction within whichhe functions.“Despite inaccurate reports and misquotes, the Church of Satan not only acceptsmaterial contributions,but returns recognition for those acts commensurate with their magnitude. Tooperate in any other fashionwould be ungrateful, hypocritical, and just plain foolish. Thereforeprofessional services, funds, realestate, objects of value, etc., which contribute to the tangible, worldlysuccess of the Church of Satanare qualification for elevation to both II° and III°. The churches of the godlymay not have lived bybread alone, but they’ve grabbed more than their share of dough over the years.The frankly materialisticconcept of Satanism can always use a little bread or its equivalent.“It would be not only unSatanic but contradictory to the teachings of our leadernot to mention the actof ‘pleasing the boss’ as an opportunity for advancement to any higher degreewithin the Organization.Anton LaVey is notoriously Diabolical (to those who know him) in his response toand recognition of hismore pleasing advocates. Nuff said.“Elevation to the II° may be attained, as an alternative to the foregoing,through application andevaluation of a specially prepared test, designed to elicit a wide variety ofresponses. As in the past, theprocessing fee for the II° test is $20, though the entire format of the test hasbeen changed. The $20749 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Diane LaVey, May 16, X/1975.750 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 20, X/1975.- 409 -processing fee barely keeps the examiners in Beluga caviar and Stolichnaya vodkawhile they areprocessing.”* * *[We will leave it up to you to diplomatically tell them that they do notautomatically get put in touchwith their R.A. And of course info on regional newsletters would also come afterhaving them provethemselves worthy of further contacts. But something must be said in thisregard, because we are swampedwith letters asking for contacts.]751I read and reread the article. No matter how I tried to play it back to myself,it kept saying that thePriesthood of Mendes was for sale. That couldn’t be; the notion was ridiculous.I handed the draft article to Lilith to see how she might react to it. Shelooked at it casually, then moreintently, and then turned towards me with disbelief and tears in her eyes.I quickly reassured her. It was obviously a bad choice in wording, and I wouldredraft the article tocorrect it. I revised it (Appendix #127) and sent the camera copy of the newCloven Hoof issue to theLaVeys with the following cover letter, in which I thought I’d better includesomething as diplomaticallyas possible about the concern the LaVeys’ draft had evoked:Under separate cover cometh ye Hoofe. Instead of making the lead article alittle stronger, I went aheadand made it a whole lot stronger. Anyone who fails to get the message now can’tbe reached by anythingshort of a whack on the skull with a 2x4, which is impractical by mail.I also expanded and strengthened the case for contributions to the Church,wording the appeal towardsthose in a position to come up with good-sized hunks of money. Hence all theharping on taxes. Theinformation in the article conforms to general I.R.S. policy. The Church ofSatan’s I.R.S. standing is notgermane to the matter.Let’s take an example: If Satanist John Jones sends the Church of Satan a checkfor $1,000, he candeduct that as a contribution to his church. [I.R.S. forms, by the way, do noteven ask the name of thechurch.] If the Church of Satan is set up with the I.R.S. as a tax-exemptreligious organization, you wouldpay no income taxes on that $1,000. If the Church of Satan is not certified thatway with the I.R.S., youwould pay regular income taxes on the $1,000. But this does not affect Jones’tax reporting. 752There are many ways in which cash and assets may be donated to a church for taxbenefits and shelters.Your accountant should get cracking and work up a summary for you to providepersons who inquire aboutmaking contributions. The Hoof should also get the word around. A “charitableremainder trust” is one suchway. If your accountant doesn’t know what I’m talking about, see anotheraccountant!I’ve purposely left the Church of Satan’s form of gratitude for contributionsopen. This enables you tonegotiate and/or tailor responses as you deem appropriate.Since the Church of Satan has so many other ways to thank people forcontributions, let’s not “sell” ourdegrees. The symbolism and image of the degrees are sacred to those whopresently hold them, and a pricecould never be set upon them. To do so would be to lose the lifeblood of theChurch as an institutiondestined to revolutionize human history. We have the ignoble fate of Crowley’sorganizations as a case inpoint.I was very pleased and proud to hear of that sword’s final placement at 6114.Privately I had hoped thatit would wind up in the Main Chamber, because I had acquired it with thatatmosphere in mind. May youuse it to sacrifice many virgins [if you can still find any]. 753751 LaVey, Anton, enclosure to letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 20,X/1975.752 Actually this was ignorantly-incorrect advice on my part. Any donations tothe Church of Satan would have required the Church to haveIRS tax-exempt status in order to be deductible by the donor. While the Churchhad been created as a nonprofit corporation in 1971, it hadnever qualified for U.S. or California tax-exemption.753 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton & Diane LaVey, May 25, X/1975.- 410 -Thinking the matter done with, I sat back to await the printed Hoof in the mail.What I got instead wasthe returned camera copy, together with a surprisingly terse note from AntonLaVey:Dear Mike:Phooey on page one! Your two-by-four is made of balsa wood. Delete: Page one -second, third, fourth,fifth (continued on page two) paragraphs. Delete: “Backscratching” section (twoparas.).Following opening para., use original copy verbatim, beginning “Advancement tothe II° (Witch orWarlock) …” and ending with “Nuff said.” Final para for lead article is:Elevation to the Second Degree may be attained, as an alternative to theforegoing, through applicationand evaluation of a specially prepared test, designed to elicit a wide varietyof responses. As in the past, theprocessing fee for the II° test is $20, though the entire format of the test hasbeen changed. The $20processing fee barely keeps the examiners in Beluga caviar and Stolichnaya vodkawhile they areprocessing.I have good reason for what I’m doing.Anton754I could not believe it. What was going on in San Francisco? This couldn’t beAnton LaVey speaking.He must have been coaxed into this crazy policy decision by some currentcourtier or advisor who knewnothing and cared nothing for the Church of Satan. Fazzini? Wolfe? Who couldknow?The relationship between the LaVeys and myself had long since become one of“family”. They trustedme implicitly and I trusted them in kind; and our continuing dialogue concerningChurch matters hadalways been couched in a very deep and real affection between the three of us.Now, suddenly, I felt a cold, painful distance between us. Anton LaVey had takena position that Icould neither accept nor somehow rationalize away as I had Tony Fazzini’s bluemedallion. Desperately,with an unaccustomed formality, I wrote back to Anton:Dear Sir:I know that you have good reason for your decisions. Otherwise I would not havedevoted the last sixyears to the Church of Satan. Yet, if you told me to blow your head off with ashotgun, I wouldn’t do it. Andthat original Hoof article of yours would undermine the entire substance of theChurch. Any advisor ofyours who says that it will not is either a fool or a “yes-man” afraid to speakfrankly in your presence.The people who will establish the Church of Satan as a great and lastinginstitution are those whobelieve in it and in the philosophy behind it. They have understood for yearsthat the degrees all signifypersonal intelligence, dedication, and accomplishment. If you now state thatmaterial contributions “arequalification for elevation to both II° and III°”, they will feel betrayed.Those with a strong sense of self-respect could not retain their degrees or membership under such circumstances.Any persons who remainedwould be bootlickers who care nothing for the ideals of Satanism as long as theycan curry your personalfavor.It is a mistake to think that you will attract contributions by selling thedegrees of the Church. Peopledonate funds to organizations whose principles they admire. They won’t give acent to a church known topawn its priesthood and initiatory degrees.If the Church of Satan needs money, there are many ways we can go about itwithout prostitutingourselves. We might hold membership drives, increase membership and renewalfees, ask for contributionsvia the Hoof, hold raffles, sell a variety of decorative items, etc. I will behappy to work out some plansalong these lines and to follow through with them for you.If a big shot approaches the Church with a sizable contribution, we can take himto dinner, give him anhonor guard, present him with a cape & sword & plumed hat, and dub him a GrandKnight Commander ofthe Legion of Honor of the Infernal Empire, First Class. And he’ll be far moreimpressed than he wouldhave been had he received a black or white or blue Baphomet.754 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, May 27, X/1975.- 411 -As for the comment about “pleasing the boss”, our people believe that they aredoing precisely that byliving and promoting the philosophy you have authored and championed. It isslow, hard, and occasionallydangerous work. You live behind a protective fence in San Francisco, butannounced Satanic officialsaround the country can’t take such precautions. Yet even so they are pleased andproud if you gainadditional fame and fortune at least partly through their efforts. These effortsare forthcoming because youare respected as a man of principle who has taken a final stand againsthypocrisy.So if you show favoritism to courtiers and personality-cult fans, you will nothave a true Church ofSatan. Instead you will have an Anton LaVey Fan Club composed of the mostsuperficial sort of people.The people who will build the Church of Satan into a great institution willnever be found sitting at yourfeet. They will be too busy putting your ideas to work out in the world.I have already spent a good deal of time, quite possibly without success, tryingto defend your gift ofthe IV° to your family chauffeur to members of the Church who have heard aboutit. I like Tony personally,but that blue Baphomet has become a slap in the face to some of your mostdedicated field members andofficials. And not because they themselves don’t have it.It would have been very easy for me to say none of these things, put thatoriginal article in the Hoof,and make consoling noises while the Church of Satan blew itself to bits. But Ihave a higher regard for youthan that, and if that means being the only one to tell you things you don’twant to hear, I guess I have to doit. That doesn’t mean I enjoy it.Most respectfully,MichaelP.S.: To date the only other person who has seen that original text is Lilith. Ihanded it to her withoutcomment to test her reaction. At first she thought it a practical joke, and thenshe cried for a quarter of anhour. She calmed down only when I said that the text was misleading and intendedonly to convey thepoints which I subsequently included in the “Backscratching” article. I havetold her nothing further sincethat time. 755While I waited for Anton’s reply, I was consumed with doubts and indecision. HadI somehowmisinterpreted the LaVey article? Anton’s note? No, every time I read and rereadthem, they pointedinescapably in the same direction. Should I have tried to telephone, to drive toSan Francisco? Perhaps -but this was a key policy decision, not a casual whim which small talk couldsmooth over. I half-expecteda reply which would “magically” clear up the entire “misunderstanding” andlightheartedly poke fun at mefor not seeing something that I should have seen from the beginning. What Ireceived instead was theletter from Diane LaVey reproduced as Appendix #128.Diane’s letter arrived on the same day I had to drive to Los Angeles for anotherArmy Reservemeeting. I knew how I read it and how Lilith read it; now I wanted an outsideopinion. I called Dale Seagoin Santa Monica and asked him to select a restaurant for supper, saying nothingabout the Hoof exchange.We dined at one of Dale’s favorite oriental restaurants in Santa Monica, and asthe waiter cleared thetable I put the exchange of letters and articles before Dale and said, “Tell mewhat you think.” He readslowly through the papers, then looked up at me in shock. “Dr. LaVey has soldout,” he said.By the time I returned to Santa Barbara, pain and bewilderment had given way toan entirely newemotion - one which I had never before felt towards Anton and Diane - cold fury.I was bitterly, blindlyangry. I had been betrayed; the Priesthood had been betrayed; the Church ofSatan had been betrayed; thePrince of Darkness himself had been betrayed. All the years of struggle, ofsacrifices, of dangers and risks- all for nothing. Something indescribable that had promised to lift the humanrace out of its eternalbestiality and slavery - gone, shattered, crushed into the dirt … and by thevery man who had brought itinto being.I had no idea what kind of future might now lie ahead. I knew only that I couldnot walk a single stepfurther with a Church of Satan that had become a mockery of its name. Even ifmankind were now to slip755 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Anton LaVey, May 31, X/1975.- 412 -back into its natural, bestial state, and if Satan were to abandon his Church asa failed, prematureexperiment, still I would have to make a final statement on his behalf, for hishonor. I accordingly wrotethe letter reproduced as Appendix #129, copies of which I also sent to theentire Priesthood, as well as tothe few Regional Agents who had managed to continue functioning despite theconstraints of the newPhase.No reply was forthcoming from the LaVeys, nor did I expect one, nor was I in themood to listen toone. What did begin to pour into my mailbox were scores of copies of letters ofresignation from theChurch of Satan, a sampling of which is reproduced in Appendices #132-141.Within days the Church of Satan was dead. Every individual who had given itlife, authenticity, andreality beyond a name and a reflection of Anton LaVey had refuted it.What must have been the atmosphere at 6114 California Street as day after daybrought condemnationand rejection? To the old Anton LaVey I had known, admired, and loved it wouldhave been a mortalblow. But to this strange new Anton LaVey who could prostitute the very SatanicPriesthood itself? He hadalready turned away from the Church and its members, and their reproaches wouldmean nothing to him.And so it seemed from his eventual proclamation in answer to my resignation,which is reproduced asAppendix #142. [My response to it follows as Appendix #143.]I suddenly found myself being looked at expectantly by a large number ofSatanists, Witches,Warlocks, Priests, and Priestesses. Was this the end, or could we somehow try tocarry on? A “SecondChurch of Satan”? Perhaps so, strange though the idea seemed to us. I sent out abulletin:The machinery of the old Church of Satan, Inc. is no good to us. We don’t knowwhat the books looklike, nor is there any responsible financial or secretarial staff to which wemay turn. “Lana Green” and“J.M.K.” are merely front names. I don’t know what debts there may be or whatadministrative snarls mayexist. As for the Council of Nine, it has met only infrequently - and then onlyas a program advisory panel,not as a true board of directors in the corporate sense. We are going to changeall that.The first thing we do is to incorporate a nonprofit organization with a namesimilar to but distinct fromthe Church of Satan. This is in the process of being done right now. I will tellyou the exact name as soon asit has been legally protected [originally “Second Church of Satan”].All censorship and communications restriction ends. All members of thePriesthood will have access tothe full membership list. Addresses of local and regional newsletters will oncemore be released to all, andprior clearance or delay of all such newsletters will be a thing of the past.Each new member’s name will bemade known to all III°+ officials, and he himself will immediately receive thename and address of a Witchor Warlock capable of providing initial, personalized guidance and of referringhim to other Satanists if hisefforts merit it.Impersonal standards for all degrees will be established and maintained. Alldegrees will be conferredby the High Priest initially. Later IV° officials may be empowered to evaluatecandidates for the II°/III° intheir spheres of influence and authority. The High Priest will remain the soleauthority to confer the IV°, buteach new IV° will require approval by a majority of the Council of Nine.No more nonmember subscriptions or nonmember affiliations under any guise.Anyone who expects toget anything out of this organization will have to join it 100%. No morehonorary Priesthoods. NoMagisters or Priests who don’t do a damned thing.Each new member will be expected to produce appropriate evidence during hisinitial year ofmembership that he is practicing Satanism forthrightly and unashamedly.Otherwise he will not bepermitted to renew his membership, fee or no fee. The same holds true for eachSatanist of each degree foreach year. And the standards will get tougher as the degrees get higher. 756As promising as the situation might be beginning to seem from a purelyorganizational standpoint, Iwas far from satisfied with the cascade of events that had brought the crisisabout. My feelings at that timeare summarized in a letter which I sent out on June 23:756 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Church of Satan respondents, June 16, X/1975.- 413 -When it became evident to me that the Church of Satan was to be destroyed, Isought an explanation viaceremonial invocation. Since the 9th of June I had received a series ofindications that the overall situationand my own actions therein were not haphazard. Consultation of the Book of Thothon Friday, June 13th, forexample, yielded the following sequence: 2 of Cups, 7 of Disks, 9 of Disks, 2 ofWands, The Devil. But Ihad not received what I considered to be a conclusive answer to the meaning ofthese events.Because of the strength intrinsic in the Church of Satan, it seemed illogical tome that it could cease toexist so suddenly. The actions of Anton Szandor LaVey, a Magus V°, also seemedoddly out of character tothe point of complete inconsistency. And, during the ending of the Church ofSatan, there had been nomanifestation or action evident by the principal entity - the Prince of Darknesshimself.It is the right of a Magister Templi to evoke the Prince of Darkness if it ishis Will to do so. During thenight of June 21-22, X, therefore, I addressed such an evocation by means of thefirst Part of the Word of Set[as I had since come to understand as the original “Enochian Keys”]. Theevocation was effective, and ananswer was received. 757That answer was the Book of Coming Forth by Night, through which the Prince ofDarknesstransferred his sanction from the Church of Satan to what would now be calledthe Temple of Set. Ananalysis of the Book of Coming Forth by Night is beyond the scope of thishistory and will be found in mycompanion volume The Temple of Set.The Temple of Set was founded in accordance with the Book of Coming Forth byNight and hascontinued to uphold the principles proclaimed in that document.The passage of time since the 1975 crisis did not serve to soften Anton’sbitterness towards the Templeof Set and myself - a mixture of hatred and envy not unlike that which Mr. Hydepresumably felt for Dr.Jekyll. Ironically the Temple of Set preserved, and has gone on to strengthenthe very things about theChurch of Satan which had most inspired Anton himself. Similarly the Temple hasrejected theSchadenfreude characteristic of the Magic Circle, and which loomed again afterthe disasters of the early1970s. It acknowledges the Prince of Darkness without qualification, and affirmsthe Black Arts as themeans to mankind’s triumph - not as an excuse for failure.If the Temple of Set became an agonizing wound in the side of Anton LaVey, itwas thus one which,like that of Parsifal’s Grail King, could never heal. It is the Grail of theChurch of Satan, the promise ofall that the Church worked so hard to attain during those memorable years1966-1975.757 Letter, M.A. Aquino, accompanying original 30 copies of the Book of ComingForth by Night, June 22, X/1975.- 414 -And among the worthy people who have so kindly received us, I revise my recordofthese adventures once more.

What I nowaffirm isthat I have a right to speak of these seas, under which in less than ten monthsI have crossed20,000 leagues in that submarine tour of the world which has revealed so manywonders.But what has become of the Nautilus? Did it resist the pressure of the mælstrom?DoesCaptain Nemo still live? And does he still follow under the ocean thosefrightfulretaliations? Or did he stop after that last hecatomb?Will the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the history ofhis life?Shall I ever know the name of this man? Will the missing vessel tell us by itsnationalitythat of Captain Nemo?I hope so. And I also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the sea at itsmostterrible gulf, and that the Nautilus has survived where so many other vesselshave beenlost!If it be so - if Captain Nemo still inhabits the ocean, his adopted country, mayhatred beappeased in that savage heart! May the contemplation of so many wondersextinguishforever the spirit of vengeance! May the judge disappear, and the philosophercontinue thepeaceful exploration of the sea!If his destiny be strange, it is also sublime.

And so Ithought to honor himbeyond other men.

I would cease to be One, for I should become All.To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to break his Self-reference to the boundsin which hissemblance must exist.I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore to AntonSzandor LaVey hishuman aspect and his degree of Magus in my Order.

And now I heard his voice, rising, swelling,thundering through theflaring light, and as I fell, the radiance increasing, increasing, poured overme in waves of flame. Then Isank into the depths, and I heard the King in Yellow whispering to my soul: “Itis a fearful thing to fallinto the hands of the living God!”Robert W. ChambersThe King in Yellow, 1895- 418 -[index-419_1.jpg]- 419 -Quos Deus Vult Perdere Prius Dementat.- Ancient Roman proverbThe First (1978) and Second (1983) Editions of The Church of Satan ended withthe events of Chapter35. There were three reasons for this:First, in the greater sense, the history of the Church of Satan came to an endwith the crisis of X/1975,the disintegration of the Church as an institution, and the creation of theTemple of Set. Thereafter, whileAnton - and for a time Diane and Zeena - LaVey sought to maintain the fiction ofa functioningorganization on the strength of the Church’s pre-1975 reputation, nothing of theoriginal Church existedbehind the facade.Second, as one hesitates to view the decomposing corpse of a person whom oneremembers as aliving, vital being, I could not bring myself to write about the ugly zombie thepost-1975 “Church” hadbecome. I wanted to think of it always as I had known it in its days ofstrength, majesty, and above allauthenticity. I had the warning of Conchis from John Fowles’ The Magus:Sometimes to return is a vulgarity … Perhaps one day, Nicholas, you will have anexperience thatmeans a great deal to you. You will then realize what I mean when I say thatsome experiences so possessyou that the one thing you cannot tolerate is the thought of their not being insome way forever present.Seidevarre is a place I do not want time to touch. So I am not interested inwhat it is now. Or what itsinhabitants are now. If they still are.758Third, my estrangement from Anton LaVey caused me intense personal pain. For sixyears I hadregarded him as a friend, mentor, and ultimately “Devil-father” - a bond ofaffection and respect clearly asprofound and meaningful to him as to me. That an impasse of principles shouldhave brought about thedestruction of this bond, replacing it with an almost pathological hatred on hispart and an impatientexasperation on mine, seemed the harshest of ironies.Over the subsequent years I would constantly be approached by a wide assortmentof Anton LaVey-detractors, expecting me to confirm their judgments of him as a crank, fraud,con-artist, or even quasi-criminal. With relish they would quote Anton’s periodic public denunciations andprivately-expressedpathological hatred of the Temple of Set or myself. Much to their surprise, Irefused to do more than saythat I considered his post-75 statements unreliable and emotionally-motivated.My overriding reaction wasone of irritation, that I should be placed in the position of defending thelegacy of someone who seemed758 Fowles, John, The Magus, page #310.- 420 -determined to wreck it - and whose personal bête noire happened to be, as itwere, the very Repairer of hisReputation. 759But even as Saruman passed close to Frodo, a knife flashed in his hand, and hestabbed swiftly. Theblade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. A dozen hobbits, led by Sam,leaped forward with a cryand flung the villain to the ground. Sam drew his sword.“No, Sam!” said Frodo. “Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt me. And inany case I do notwish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was great once, of a noble kind thatwe should not dare to raiseour hands against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would stillspare him in the hope that hemay find it.”Saruman rose to his feet and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look in hiseyes of mingled wonderand respect and hatred. “You have grown, Halfling,” he said. “Yes, you havegrown very much. You arewise, and cruel. You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must gohence in bitterness, in debtto your mercy. I hate it and you!” 760For the Third (1992) and subsequent Editions, I changed my mind. Anton’sstatements and actionsafter 1975 require inclusion and analysis if the entire story to date is to betold; therefore Chapter 36 andthis one. They do not make pleasant reading, nor was it pleasant to write them.So dramatic is the changeof tone from the pre-1975 history that the reader may wonder if I am talkingabout the same person. Inanswer I refer that reader to the implications of Chapter 36.* * * * *In June 1975 a curtain of utter secrecy, mistrust, and deception descended over6114 California Street.Thereafter Anton LaVey issued no organizational information to either the publicor to the remnants ofsuch Church of Satan membership as had decided to remain. Information concerningthe Church, or theLaVeys personally, henceforth appeared only in the form of propagandistic ClovenHoof issues and stage-managed books and magazine articles.A touch of the real Anton LaVey surfaced for a brief moment in a 1978 interviewgranted to a San Josenewspaper (Appendix #144). A photograph of Anton accompanying the articlerevealed a gaunt, haggardface from which the eyes stared painfully [Plate #35].The design and contents of the Hoof issues are quite revealing. A flurry ofpromotions - some real,some fictitious - followed the exodus of the operational Priesthood in 1975:“John M. Kincaid” suddenlybecame a real person again and in 1976 was promoted to Magister. Within a yearof the 1975 crisisSatanists I° Maarten Lamers and Randall Alfred were promoted to Priest andMagister respectively;nonmembers Irma Serrano, George Natanson, Jim Osborne were created Priests; andnonmember AnthonyVincent was created Magister. The keying of Baphomet medallion colors to thedegree-system waseliminated. An article announced, fictitiously, that 6114 California Street hadbeen closed and the Churchof Satan moved to “new offices downtown” in San Francisco.A few of the faithful were initially marshaled to write articles for the Hoof,but by 1977 even the useof pseudonyms could not conceal that the entire issues were now being written byAnton and Diane LaVeyalone.In 1981 the newsletter shrank from four pages to one page. At the end of 1984,when Diane departed,the Hoof went from bimonthly to quarterly and, except for reprints of old AntonLaVey essays, was nowwritten by Anton’s new live-in girl Sharon Densley (whom Anton renamed “BlancheBarton”). In this759 Chapter 1, The King in Yellow.760 Tolkien, J.R.R., The Lord of the Rings. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, SecondEdition, 1967, page #III-299.- 421 -format it stumbled irregularly on for another three years, finally shutting downentirely “due to the rapidexpansion of the Church of Satan” (!) in 1988.As a rostrum for Anton LaVey as social critic and counterculture eccentric, thepost-75 Hoof was not atall dull. He was a colorful writer, and he had a lot of scorn to heap on popularpastimes, trends, andculture. Alternating with his social satire were litanies to his own tastes,from staying up all night &sleeping during the day a la Dracula, collecting of kitsch & schlockbric-a-brac, 1940s films, music, &clothes, the appeal of fat women, the repulsiveness of exercise, and howabsolutely everyone wascontinuing to steal his ideas.Suddenly the Sigil of Baphomet became very important. In 1985 Anton beganclaiming that it was“copyrighted” to the Church of Satan [I supposed he meant “trademarked”], anddutifully its subsequentappearance on the Hoof was graced with an attached ® - which to my way ofthinking rather detractedfrom its esoteric impact.761 The price of the remaining Wolf-Brown Baphometmedallions - advertised ona flyer as “the Rolls-Royce of occult jewelry” - rose from the pre-1975 $20 to$50: quite a markupconsidering the manufacturing cost of $3!Not surprisingly the Temple of Set came in for special LaVey venom: It wascalled everything from“Christian Satanism” to a “Greek philosophical stoa” to “Laurel & Hardy’s Sonsof the Desert”. In the1988 final issue of the Hoof, in an article on Geraldo Rivera’s Halloween“Satanism” television special, itreceived a final caustic snarl:Zeena LaVey was seated next to the charismatic leader of the “Temple of Set”,which has beendescribed as New Age or Christian Satanism. Since its formation in the mid-70s,we have periodicallyreceived inquiries asking about any affiliation the Temple of Set has with theChurch of Satan. There isnone. It is simply a rip-off group that has been riding on our coattails foryears. Such is the price of success.What was also remarkable about the post-75 Hoof was not just what was in it butwhat was missingfrom it. It was absolutely devoid of mention of any Church activities orcontacts whatever, of course, andnot one of the “Priests” or “Magisters” ever represented the Church in any way -with the possibleexception of Maarten Lamers, who ran an “Amsterdam Grotto” in the Netherlands asa sex-club for ashort time until the Dutch police closed it down with a raid.Also missing from the new Hoof was Satan. And anything else dæmonic. Andanything even remotelyconnected with the ceremonial Black Magic of the Satanic Bible and SatanicRituals. The name ofAnton’s enterprise accordingly became something nonsensical: It was no longer a“church”, it could notbe called a “religion”, and it had nothing whatever to do with “Satan”. Onewonders exactly what theassorted new priests, if indeed they actually existed as real people, fanciedthemselves to be priests of.By 1984 Diane LaVey had apparently had enough. Said the Sacramento Bee:If Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, then Diane Hegarty is about to fightlike the Devil. Hegarty,the self-proclaimed Princess of Darkness, is suing her former companion of 22years, Anton SzandorLaVey, the millionaire-founder of the San Francisco-based Church of Satan. In apalimony case to be heardFriday, Hegarty wants LaVey to sell all of the couple’s possessions and splitthe earnings with her.Among the contested items: a bed of nails, a wooden coffin, medieval torturedevices, seven daggers, atombstone coffee-table, a shrunken head, an antique Egyptian skull, a stuffedjaguar, a crystal ball, and a761 The Baphomet emblem as used by the Church of Satan was not original to itnor created by Anton LaVey, hence cannot be trademarked.The original Baphomet dates at least as far back as the medieval KnightsTemplar. The artwork for the current emblem’s goat/pentagram firstappears in Oswald Wirth, La fran-maconnerie rendue intelligible à ces adeptes -II, “Le compagnon” , Paris: Derry-Livres, 1931, page #60.The complete emblem with the added circles and “LVYThN” Hebrew letters appearson the cover of Maurice Bessy, A Pictorial History ofMagic and the Supernatural, London: Spring Books, 1964 - two years before thecreation of the Church of Satan. [The original edition of thiswork - Histoire en 1000 images de la magie - was published in 1961 by Editionsdu Pont Royal.] Early photos of Church activities often showAnton or his disciples using the Bessy book as a photo-prop because of the largecover-emblem, and he included it in his Compleat Witchbibliography [see Appendix #24]. The Baphomet is clearly in the public domain.- 422 -reproduction of King Tutankhamen’s sarcophagus. The list numbers about 100possessions she wants soldto redeem her share.All Hell broke loose between the couple in 1984, when Hegarty moved out of thecouple’s CaliforniaStreet mansion, claiming LaVey had beaten her. Hegarty alleged in her lawsuitthat LaVey applied ahammerlock to her neck, lifted her off the ground, and rendered her unconscious.The couple subsequently signed a 12-page legal agreement that gave Hegartypossession of the couple’s1967 Jaguar and LaVey possession of the 1936 Cord, 1972 Datsun 280, and 1976Cadillac limousine. Theagreement also allowed Hegarty to receive royalties from LaVey’s best-sellingcult classics the SatanicBible, Satanic Rituals, Compleat Witch, and Devil’s Notebook. But the agreementforbade LaVey fromselling or disposing of any of the couple’s community property. Now Hegartywants that changed.According to court documents, Hegarty and LaVey, who was the beneficiary offamily wealth, started livingtogether in 1962. A year later Hegarty gave birth to the couple’s only child,named Zeena.In 1966 Hegarty and LaVey formally began the Church of Satan. LaVey became theHigh Priest of theChurch and Hegarty the office manager. Although never married to LaVey, Hegartyused the name “DianeLaVey”.But the relationship started to sour after two decades. In 1985 LaVey agreed tohave separate entrancesand facilities built into the couple’s rambling estate - a LaVey family bequest- so he and Hegarty wouldn’thave to see each other. Hegarty charged that those modifications were neveradded to the house, andconsequently she never returned.In the palimony suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court May 11, 1988,Hegarty alleges she isentitled to half of LaVey’s worth since all possessions the couple owned consistof community property.Though she has a half-interest in the mansion, it is apparently not an issue inthe suit.While not formally married, the suit contends, Hegarty and LaVey acted ashusband and wife for overtwo decades. But LaVey’s attorney, Owen Mayer, said his client “has alreadycomplied with all the items ofthe agreement he made with the plaintiff. Diane really has no grounds for herbeef with Anton.”Hegarty’s suit “seeks rights that would be the envy of everyone without theinstitution of marriage,”Mayer said, adding that Hegarty is just trying to “jump on the bandwagon ofAnton’s success”.The Church of Satan boasts worldwide membership and holds regular meetings atits San Franciscoheadquarters. Officials, though, refuse to disclose how many followers theChurch has.762In a 1986 issue of the Washington Post Magazine (Appendix #145) we meet the“new” Anton LaVeyto the complete eclipse of the old. Gone is the High Priest of Satan, gone theflamboyant, MephistophelianDr. Phibes. In their place the reporter sees an old carny artist, a “junkyardintellectual”, a museum curatorin Arkham growing gradually indistinguishable from the exhibits he tends: theGeek from NightmareAlley.The grandiose claims of Anton’s “millionaire” wealth and 6114 CaliforniaStreet’s “rambling mansion/estate” status were echoed by the 1988 publication of Arthur Lyons’ Satan WantsYou: The Cult of DevilWorship in America.763Lyons concealed his Church of Satan membership [hence LaVey-orchestration of thebook] until hewas confronted with it by Larry Kahaner764 during a July 1988 episode of theLarry King Live televisioninterview show. Rather than defending it proudly, Lyons awkwardly tried to brushoff Kahaner’sinconvenient revelation as “an in-and-out affiliation for research purposes” -rather at odds with hiscontinuous membership from 1968 through 1975 [as verified by the Church recordsin my possessionthrough 1975] and presumably thereafter.762 Bloom, Stephen G., “Devil of a Palimony Dispute”, Sacramento Bee, September22, 1988.763 My review of Satan Wants You for the Scroll of Set appears as Appendix #146.764 Kahaner is the author of Cults That Kill (New York: Warner Books, 1988), a“Satanism exposé” book. My review of it for the Scroll of Set appears asAppendix #147.- 423 -Thus did Lyons finally join the parade of parasites - Truzzi, Alfred, and Moody- who, when in aposition to stand up publicly for Satanism and the Church of Satan, denied thesincerity of theirassociation with the Church - or such association altogether.After Diane’s departure, Sharon Densley supplanted her as “Secretary of theChurch of Satan” andmouthpiece for the continuing post-1975 con game. In 1990 “Blanche Barton”appeared as “author” of abook entitled The Secret Life of a Satanist: The Authorized Biography of AntonLaVey.765 Those looking inthis book for post-1975 progress of that “secret life” will search in vain; theaccomplishments showcasedall date to the pre-1975 Church, as do the celebrity personalities included inthe photo section. There isone post-1975 event cited, to be sure:On the afternoon of July 18th, 1984 LaVey is summoned into court to be formallycriminalized for thefirst time in his life. A restraining order is invoked against him by Diane, thewoman he had lived with for24 years. Anton sends a letter to Karla in Amsterdam before the hearing sayinghe wasn’t going to stand forit; that he had performed his magic, that he was going to “ride on the hotSantana winds” and that “all Hellwill break loose”. LaVey cautions Karla to keep the letter in a safe place.On the appointed afternoon, at the exact hour LaVey would have been standing infront of the judge - hedidn’t attend to contest the action - James Huberty walks into a McDonald’s inSan Ysidro, California on aday cursed by blistering Santa Ana winds … Huberty sprays the restaurant withbullets, shooting anythingthat moves … It is the worst massacre of its kind in history. Diane’s father’sname is James Hegarty. 766It is illustrative of the “Barton”-era vulgarity of 6114 California Street thatthis restaurant tragedywould be exploited in such a tasteless fashion. Even if Anton’s claim were to bebelieved, it wouldscarcely do him credit: Are we to admire someone who would slay arestaurant-full of innocent peoplesimply because he was sulking over a court-order to keep him from threatening orharming his wife?On October 25, 1988 the tabloid-television personality Geraldo Rivera aired aspecial, riding the crestof the then-raging “Satanic crime” scam, purporting to hold Satanism responsiblefor various crimescommitted by individuals having no connection to the organized Satanic religionwhatever. Rivera invitedme to appear and defend the legitimate religion. I agreed with misgivings,knowing Rivera’s agenda butfeeling that my absence would “abandon the field to the enemy”. Prior to thebroadcast I had criticizedRivera for his talk-show defamation of “Satanism” [Appendix #149].Anton LaVey was also invited to appear. Despite the fact that he and his SatanicBible were beingdenounced by scam-promoters nationwide as the inspiration for many adolescent“Satanic criminals”, heremained in hiding at 6114, sending his daughter Zeena to defend him. After hermother’s departure in1984, Anton had named Zeena to her office of High Priestess.Zeena and I met at the studio prior to the broadcast, and then sat in adjoiningstage seats during it. Shedefended her father and his work courageously, but Rivera’s attack would havebeen more effectivelyblunted if the author of the Satanic Bible had been there in person. Both off-and on-camera Zeena wasgracious and polite to both Lilith and myself. I reviewed the Rivera special forthe December XXIII/1988Scroll of Set:As most Setians know by now, I did in fact appear as a panelist on this 10/25NBC broadcast. The dayafter the last Scroll supplement [Appendix #149] went in the mail, the executiveproducer telephoned meand indicated that Paul Valentine would not appear as a spokesman for legitimateSatanism if I wouldparticipate.The show was of course a smear job on Satanism, with Rivera using the term in analarmist sense to"},{"pageContent":"characterize any and every sort of extreme criminal activity, ritual/non-ritualand real/imaginary. I expected765 My review of SLOAS for the Scroll of Set appears as Appendix #148.766 “Barton, Blanche”, Secret Life of a Satanist, page #198.- 424 -this beforehand, but felt that whatever objections and clarifications I couldmake would be better than noneat all.As it turned out, there was almost no time for any of the panelists or invitedguests in the audience,including Lilith, to talk, as Rivera filled most of the two hours withfilm-clips. But such comments as I wasable to make were well-received, and Rivera himself was courteous and respectfulboth on- and off-camera.Although the producers had also invited Anton LaVey to attend, he refused tocome - but did send hisdaughter Zeena in his stead. Under the circumstances she rose to the challengeand handled herself well.Readers of this past year’s Scrolls know enough about the “Satanic crime” scamto explode the variousstories that Rivera tried to blame on the Devil, so I see no need to go overthem here. Rather I mightconclude by quoting from a letter of mine in answer to a correspondent who askedmy impressions of thebroadcast:“It is an accepted principle in Western society that legitimate churches havethe right to define thereligion they represent. Opponents of the religion or cranks do not have thatright.“The first thing that I said to Rivera is thus the essence of the matter. Thecriminals, psychos, andassorted cranks that were shown in the film-clips were not and are notSatanists, but rather the failures andwreckage of the other moral and religious systems in which they were raised andeducated.“Rivera’s use of the term ‘Satanism’ as a theme for this special merely harksback to Nazi Germany,when it was fashionable to label all crime as ‘Jewish’. For awhile the Naziswent through the motions ofdistinguishing ‘good Jews’ and ‘bad Jews’ - the implication being that somepeople could have redeemingqualities despite the general contamination of their religion. The most that Ican say for Rivera is that hesingled out the Temple of Set and Church of Satan as ‘good Jews’.”In December 1990 Zeena sent me a letter [Appendix #150] expressing herdisillusionment with thepost-75 Church of Satan and her father’s conduct of it. She disassociatedherself from both the institutionand his name.Shortly thereafter an investigative reporter from Texas, Lawrence Wright, becameintrigued with the“LaVey legend” and set out to look into it meticulously. The result was anexplosive exposé whichappeared in a September 1991 issue of the magazine Rolling Stone [Appendix#151].767Meanwhile Diane Hegarty’s lawsuit against Anton LaVey continued. In papers filedwith the officialrecord of the San Francisco Superior Court, the first clear picture of life atpost-1975 6114 CaliforniaStreet began to emerge.In 1985 Anton and Diane signed an agreement to partition 6114 California Streetand identify jointly-owned personal articles at the building [Appendix #152].The agreement didn’t work out. Diane left the house in 1984 and in 1988 filedher lawsuit againstAnton, alleging a history of “violent and abusive behavior” on his part whichhad finally driven her fromthe residence “in fear for her life”. “She sought and obtained in 1984, 1985,and 1986 restraining ordersprohibiting defendant LaVey from harassing or molesting her. Despite [these]orders, defendant LaVeycontinued to contact plaintiff with threats of violence, both written &telephonic, until January 1988.” 768From 1965 to 1984, Diane continued, she had participated as a “partner” ofAnton’s in the operation ofthe Church of Satan, and for another 2 years indirectly as a bookkeeper &correspondent.On or about 4/16/86 defendant took exclusive possession & control of thebusiness, and has since hadfor his individual use & benefit large sums of money from the receipts of thepartnership businessexceeding his rightful share, and has refused to account to plaintiff for same.Plaintiff is informed andbelieves, and on such information & belief alleges that the sum wrongfully takenby defendant, and theamount due the partnership, is at least $300,000 … It is necessary that areceiver be appointed to take767 This article was later reprinted in Lawrence Wright, Saints and Sinners. NewYork: Knopf (ISBN 0-394-57924-0), 1993.768 First Amended Complaint, Hegarty v LaVey, Case #891863, December 7, 1988[Appendix #153].- 425 -possession of all property & accounts of the partnership to receive accountspayable, pay current debts, andwind up the business of the partnership. 769In his June 1989 answer [Appendix #154] Anton LaVey denied most of Diane’sclaims and allegations- for instance that he had ever been violent or abusive to her, that she hadleft 6114 in fear for her life, thathis father gave 6114 to the two of them, and that she was “the co-owner withdefendant of any real andpersonal property”.Concerning the Church of Satan, he denied that he and Diane had ever formed sucha “partnership”, orthat she had ever “participated equally in promoting & operating said business”.Anton then filed a cross-complaint against Diane alleging that she had defrauded him because, aftersigning the 1984 agreement,she “never intended to reside at 6114 California Street”.Sharon “Blanche Barton” Densley appeared on the stage in June 1990, when shesent a letter toDiane’s attorney waxing indignant about Anton’s “weakened medical condition”:Therefore Mr. LaVey’s daughter Karla and I have devised a plan by which Ms.Hegarty can receive themoney she feels is due her, and perhaps Mr. LaVey can be allowed some respitefrom this stress so that hisovertaxed body can heal.We propose that together she and I establish a nonprofit corporation for theexpress purpose of solicitingfunds from the membership of the Church of Satan to pay off Ms. Hegarty, savingwhat we hold as a sacredbuilding (also Miss LaVey’s family home) from a forced sale, and now to alsosave our founder and leaderAnton LaVey. This will necessitate informing the membership at large of thefacts of the case through ourinternational newsletter and through more direct means. Ms. Hegarty and yourselfwill have to be referredto by name as initiating the case against Mr. LaVey, and we would provide yourbusiness address and phonenumber, Ms. Benford, so that our members could indeed check on the gravity ofthe situation if they sodesired.You must understand that one of the precepts of the Church of Satan has alwaysbeen that we do notsolicit anything from our members, either money or time. But, again, recentdevelopments have forced us toconsider all possible avenues to achieve a speedy resolution to this case. Andif the membership of theChurch of Satan understood fully what is being attacked and what is in jeopardy,I have no doubt that theywould be stirred to immediate action. Whether you realize it or not, to a lot ofpeople the house you areattacking is Mecca, the spot where our religion was born, and Mr. LaVey is ourreligious leader. I’m notsure you understand how blindly zealous some people can be about such things.Wars are fought, people dieover such causes. And in that light the ACLU may have an interest in this caseif it is pursued much further,as well.I myself have been committed to Mr. LaVey and his organization for 14 years now,and am appalled andenraged by Ms. Hegarty’s heartless tactics over the last 6 years. Thepublication of my first book isimminent, however, and I would be willing to donate half my earnings from it toMs. Hegarty if it wouldhelp preserve the Black House and its contents - even though I would stillconsider these actions no lessthan extortion. And I am only representative of thousands around the world. 770In the latter part of the 1980s the “antisocial Satanism” of Anton LaVey hadattracted some interestfrom an extremely alienated subculture, that of “skinheads” and neo-Nazis.I use these terms imprecisely, because both embrace not tightly-cohesive groupsbut rather a widespectrum of individualistic rebels. Some neo-Nazi groups, for example, arerabidly fundamentalistChristian to the point of advocating the extermination of anyone who isn’t. Noris the “neo-Nazi” labeltechnically accurate. Most “neo-Nazis” revere Adolf Hitler primarily for theshock value of doing so; theyknow little if anything of the German political and social situation whichbrought him to power, nor of theconservative, tradition-intensive philosophy he espoused. [Indeed, in NaziGerman concentration camps, a769 Ibid., Sixth Cause of Action.770 Letter, “Blanche Barton” to Elizabeth Benford, June 6, 1990.- 426 -special category was reserved for “antisocial elements”, embracing rebelliousspirits who refused tocooperate with the strict community conformist programs of the regime.]Arriving on the 6114 scene during the later 1980s, in any event, was NikolasSchreck, a stark,enigmatic writer and musician who had gained notoriety through the sometimesvolatile performances ofRadio Werewolf, his book The Manson File, and companion video Charles MansonSuperstar. 771 In 1984Schreck established a medium to symbolize and promote his ideas, Radio Werewolf,which he defined as“the sonic propaganda unit of the Werewolf Order, an international society ofblack magicians dedicatedto the creation of a psychic dictatorship destined to hold sway over the last 13years of the 20th centuryand serve as a vanguard for the coming occult world order”.772 As laterelaborated by Schreck and Zeena:The WO is not an organization, as that word is commonly understood, nor achurch. We should not bedefined as a political party or an occultists’ lodge. The WO cannot be joined inthe mundane sense. It is aprocess which begins in dreams: a sorcerous circle of thought, a state of mind,accessible only by aninherent rapport with the mysterious and unnamable multiplicity of forces thatform the nexus of thismovement. It is a direct means of ingress to that realm of which only symbol andarchetype can hope todelineate to the conscious mind. We reject the ignorant categories of Left andRight, good and evil, as wellas all other semantic simplifications ... 773Presumably Schreck initially assumed Anton LaVey to be an example of this kindof enlightenedanarchism. He accepted an honorary membership in the Church of Satan and wasnamed by Anton as itspublic representative. By 1990, however, he had become disillusioned, and he andZeena departed forAustria to further research the Werewolf Order’s interests and experiment withsome recording ventures.During the Hegarty/LaVey court case, Schreck was asked to provide a statement,and he complied:From February 1988 to April 1990 I worked as an associate of and frequentcollaborator with AntonLaVey.During the duration of my relationship with Mr. LaVey, I became increasinglyaware of his tendency touse a litany of alleged illnesses and sicknesses as a convenient excuse to avoidany unpleasant situation, orindeed to avoid any decision-making or responsibility for his own actions. Iwitnessed that Mr. LaVeyfrequently attempted to forestall, postpone, or evade any situation in his lifewhich may have provenconfrontational, challenging, or even minutely stressful to him through suchmedically-oriented excuses.Many times during my attempts to work with Mr. LaVey on various projects(interviews for books,recording of his music, etc.), he and his secretary Blanche Barton wouldprocrastinate, cancel at the lastminute, or completely alter their previous plans due to what both of themclaimed to be his “healthproblems”. It became clear to me that in his dealings with me and others it wasa long-standing habit of Mr.LaVey’s to blame any irresponsibility, inconsistency, or unreliability on whathe consistently represented ashis poor state of health …I trust that in light of Mr. LaVey’s track record of utilizing medical problemsto escape fromresponsibility and his unwavering contempt for the due process of law, the courtwill not allow him tocontinue to avoid justice with such flimsy prevarications.I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 774To this Zeena added:771 Schreck, Nikolas (Ed.), The Manson File.

Case #891863, August 27, 1991.- 427 -In 1974 my mother explained to me that my father had a heart murmur in additionto the hypertensionwe already knew about. For several years my mother, my sister Karla, and I hadall made ourselvesavailable to monitor his blood pressure, using a standard cuff and meter.Sometimes defendant had meperform this task 3-5 times in a half-hour period. Defendant would then take thehighest reading as proof hecould not participate in any deadline or family responsibility.Defendant LaVey often developed other sudden illnesses, such as headaches, flu,or dizziness. Thesesymptoms usually occurred shortly before a long-planned appointment orcommitment, causing him tocancel his participation. If I mentioned having a cold, he always had worsesymptoms than mine.Since my mother filed this action, I have frequently heard defendant LaVeyexpress his utter contemptfor all aspects of the case. He consistently refused to get a lawyer, expressingthe belief that if he refused toparticipate, “the idiots would get tired of their little game and just give up”.Defendant LaVey has left me in no doubt that he did not intend to participate inthe lawsuit, although hewas aware at all times what was being asked of him. His health was not the issueexcept when it was useful.He simply wanted to punish my mother for leaving him by depriving her ofeverything she had worked toobtain during the time they lived together.I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 775This picture of Anton LaVey as a reclusive, hypochondriac coward, hiding behindthe skirts of hiswife, his daughters, and Densley whenever confronted with anything disturbing,was further supported byDiane herself:During the 23 years I lived with defendant LaVey, his health was always apivotal issue. Though herefused to attend to his teeth or his personal hygiene - never bathing or seeinga dentist - he worriedconstantly about his hypertension and his heart murmur, diagnosed by Dr. IrvingWarner in 1970.Dr. Warner and several other doctors recommended regular cardiac monitoring andmoderate exerciseto defendant. He chose to ignore most of their advice, particularly thatpertaining to treatment. He wouldkeep his regularly-scheduled doctor’s appointments but refused to participate incardiac testing, cardiacmonitoring, or exercise. Instead he would insist that his daughters and Imeasure his blood pressure, using adevice we had purchased for the purpose. We sometimes performed this service forhim as many as 15times a day. Often, if the reading was high, he would accuse me of saying ordoing something to elevate hisblood pressure. He would then use the elevated blood reading as an excuse tocancel participation inwhatever activity we had planned. Many of our friends and associates observedthese episodes.I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 776In August 1991 Superior Court Judge Ollie-Marie Victoire found for Diane bydefault, “as a result ofdefendant’s failure to participate in reasonable discovery”.777 Victoire singledout Barton’s letter forspecial mention: “This letter also threatens plaintiff with action by ‘blindzealots’ of defendant’s churchshould she persist with her lawsuit.” Victoire concluded:This court specifically finds that defendant’s conduct has been calculated anddesigned to preventplaintiff from obtaining her rights to the jointly-owned real and personalproperty. He has disobeyed a courtorder and has suffered the consequences. He now seeks relief from the very courtfor which he has showncontempt in the past. The August 5, 1991 judgment has caused him to change hismind about the courtsystem, but it does not appear that the law requires this court to help him athis late awakening. 778775 Zeena, Declaration of Zeena LaVey in opposition to defendant’s motion to setaside default and stay of judgment pending determination,Case #891863, August 27, 1991.776 Hegarty, Diane, Declaration of Diane Hegarty in opposition to defendant’smotion to set aside default, Case #891863, September 3, 1991.777 Marie-Victoire, Ollie, Order denying defendant’s motions to set asidedefault and for new trial, and explanation of decision, Case #891863,September 27, 1991 [Appendix #155].778 Ibid.- 428 -Of special relevance to this history is another provision of Victoire’s ruling:A receiver will be appointed by the court, at defendant’s expense, to prepare anaccounting andinventory of all partnership assets, and upon completion of such accounting adissolution of the partnershipwill occur and all partnership assets will be divided 50-50 between the parties.779That “partnership”, of course, was/is the Church of Satan. Victoire interpretedthe Church as a“business partnership” belonging jointly to Anton and Diane, and ordered itdissolved and its assetsdivided accordingly. 780Conspicuous throughout the entire lawsuit is the complete absence of anyreligious influence in thestatements of either party [unless one cares to interpret Densley’s threat of“actions by blind zealots” as anappeal to religious values]. It is in clear contrast to the Anton/Diane LaVeydialogue during the years I-Xas quoted so extensively in this history, and evidences their fundamental changein attitude subsequent tothe 1975 crisis.Diane received a total monetary judgment of $536,500. Anton was given until theend of December1991 to either pay her or sell 6114 and pay her from the proceeds.781On October 18, 1991, however, Anton filed for Chapter 11 (reorganization)bankruptcy, thus freezingexecution of Judge Victoire’s order and allowing Densley and himself to continueliving at 6114 past thedeadline. On December 10 he appeared before the U.S. Trustee to answer questionsconcerning hispetition. Here, amidst the stark surroundings of a federal court and sworn underpenalty of perjury, Antonoffered a somewhat more humble picture of himself than that fed to tabloidjournalists and readers ofSLOAS. A transcript of the session appears as Appendix #157.On December 29 Diane filed a motion with the bankruptcy court alleging that“this bankruptcy wasfiled in bad faith for the sole purpose of thwarting the state court ordersand/or judgments in the state courtcase”. 782 In February 1992 her attorneys filed a statement with the courtconcerning 6114 CaliforniaStreet:On 2/18/92 we viewed the subject property for the first time. The house reflectsthe last 20 years as theChurch of Satan. All maintenance has been deferred, and the property is infilthy and deterioratingcondition. There is substantial doubt whether the building in its presentcondition could pass building, fire,and/or safety codes. Further the entire property is filled with books, icons,artifacts, and memorabiliaconnected with the Church of Satan, including a crystal skull and shrunken head.The lighting isdeliberately subdued, the walls are painted black or red, the odor isoppressive, and cobwebs & dustabound.Our impression of the property after inspection was verified by our real estateconsultant, who indicatedto us that in its present state the property had no rental value whatever sinceit is not in habitable condition.The kitchen and baths are unusable, there is substantial structural andrenovation work which needs to bedone in addition to interior and exterior painting, the windows need to beuncovered to allow light in, and779 Marie-Victoire, Ollie, Supplemental order after trial, Case #891863, October28, 1991.780 In 1971 the LaVeys had finally taken the steps to incorporate the Church ofSatan - an event to which the Church membership, includingmyself, paid little attention at the time on the assumption that it was littlemore than a formality for legal purposes. The Articles surfacedduring the lawsuit, of course, and appear here as Appendix #156. Although Antonlater made a habit of stating that the Church deliberatelyrefused tax-exempt status as a gesture of protest against religioustax-exemption, this was simply an excuse for the Church of Satan’s failureto qualify for exemption. On September 16, 1971 a California tax-exemption wasissued for the Church, conditional upon a federalexemption. When this was not granted, the California exemption was revoked in1973. It was reapplied for in 1975, then revoked again in1985. As of 1992 - the last time I checked - neither the California AttorneyGeneral nor the Federal Internal Revenue Service listed theChurch of Satan as an exempt organization.781 Marie-Victoire, Ollie, Supplemental order after trial, Case #891863, October28, 1991.782 Hegarty, Diane, Notice for motion and motion for relief from automatic stay,Chapter 11 Case #91-34251, December 29, 1991.- 429 -there is no heat. Further the property cannot be shown in its present stateuntil the debtor vacates and takeshis personal property with him. 783Concerning the current income from the “Church of Satan business” there was alsosome controversy.Anton himself told the court:My total income for the year 1989, after deduction of business-related expenses,was $8,091. My totalincome for the year 1990, after deduction of business-related expenses, was$14,146. My total income forthe year 1991, after deduction of business-related expenses, was $8,981.My income derives from my operation as a sole proprietor known as the Church ofSatan and fromroyalties from the sales of my books. My gross revenues for the year 1989 were$24, 503 with deductibleexpenses of $16,412. My gross income for the year 1990 was $21,565 withdeductible expenses of $7,496.My gross income for the year 1991 was $26,613 with deductible expenses of$17,360.I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 784How much of this income came from the Church of Satan, with its reputed millionsof dues-payingmembers worldwide? Said Anton to the court:I am the High Priest and controlling member of the nonprofit religiousorganization known as theChurch of Satan. No compensation is received by me for this, and no revenues aregenerated by or throughthe Church of Satan. 785Diane’s attorneys, however, were not so certain about this:The debtor’s petition indicates that no income is forthcoming from the Church ofSatan when this is thevery entity which seeks bankruptcy protection. The debtor’s income is generatedfrom royalties on thepublications authored by both the debtor and the creditor and indicated in thepetition. I am informed andbelieve that debtor has failed to report income which is derived from hisbusiness as the Church of Satan.A recent issue of The Black Flame, the “International Forum of the Church ofSatan”, indicates thatmemberships are sold for $100, franchises are available for $150,000, and thatposters, mugs, jewelry, andother memorabilia are also available for sale. It does not appear that theproceeds from any of these articleswere included in debtor’s petition. 786The Black Flame was a Church of Satan-sycophant newsletter started by PeterGilmore of New YorkCity after his 1988 attempt to court the favor of both Anton LaVey and theTemple of Set behind eachother’s back. Discovering this duplicity, the Temple cut contact with Gilmore,whereupon he created hisnewsletter - named, ironically, from the Diabolicon! - to sing the praises ofAnton and denounce theTemple.Included in the newsletter were a hoard of Baphomet trinkets for sale. To thecourt, under penalty ofperjury, Anton declared that he derived no income from any of the BF-advertiseditems.787 However inthat same BF issue containing the ads “Blanche Barton” proclaims:783 Grieco, Jane & Benford, Elizabeth, Supplemental declaration in support ofrenewal of motion for relief from automatic stay, Chapter 11Case #91-34251, February 24, 1992.784 LaVey, Anton, Declaration, Chapter 11 Case #91-34251, April 22, 1992.785 LaVey, Anton, Chapter 11 disclosure statement, Chapter 11 Case #91-34251,January 31, 1992.786 Grieco, Jane, Declaration in support of renewal of motion for relief fromautomatic stay, Chapter 11 Case #91-34251, April 29, 1992.787 LaVey, Anton, Declaration in opposition to plaintiff’s motion for relieffrom stay, Chapter 11 Case #91-34251, May 5, 1992.- 430 -Getting money by representing yourself as a Church of Satan outlet or franchiseis unethical andunlawful. If you want to use the symbols, title, philosophy, and reputation, youcan buy a C/S franchise for$150,000. Those using our symbols otherwise will be prosecuted. 788Notwithstanding the fact that the Baphomet cannot be trademarked [see footnote,this chapter], thisstatement by Densley would seem to suggest that either several unreported$150,000 franchises have goneinto the 6114 kitty or that lots of Baphomet-merchants advertised in the BF,including editor PeterGilmore, were later in the process of being sued by Anton for their “unethicaland unlawful” practices.What U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Thomas Carlson thought of all of this is notrecorded. On May 7,1992, however, he ordered the case to be converted from Chapter 11(reorganization) to Chapter 7(liquidation).An impasse of sorts had been reached. Diane’s attorneys insisted that 6114California Street could notbe shown or sold until Anton was evicted and the house cleaned and madepresentable. Judge Carlson,however, refused to evict him. Attorney costs continued to accrue, and in themeantime Diane had notreceived a cent of the proceeds authorized her by the Superior Court.On May 8, 1992 an out-of-court settlement was agreed upon. Donald Werby, an oldfriend of Anton’s,had offered to purchase 6114 for the rock-bottom price of $240,000(substantially less than the $420,000which Diane had had the house appraised at in 1991). 789 From this Karla LaVey,acting as a real estateagent, would receive $7,200 and Anton’s attorneys $10,000.By the agreement Diane would also receive 10% of future royalties only on theSatanic Bible,Compleat/Satanic Witch, and the Devil’s Notebook. She would receive nothing atall from the pastroyalties generated when the books were new and all in print and generating thebulk of their income, orfrom the time of her 1985 agreement with Anton guaranteeing her 10% royaltiesfrom that date to thepresent. A shabby, disgraceful situation indeed.Initially the deal fell through. On July 24, 1992 Karla LaVey and Werby calledDiane’s attorney JaneGrieco to ask for additional time to obtain financing.790 When Grieco demurred,Werby withdrew.Meanwhile Anton had fallen into contempt of court by ceasing to make the$500/month payments toDiane as ordered by the judge. 791 On August 27 Judge Thomas Carlson deniedAnton’s motion to dismissthe bankruptcy, and the danse macabre of the liquidation proceedings crawledonward for another sixmonths.792In March 1993 the sale of 6114 to Werby was resurrected (Appendix #158)793 , andthe followingmonth the bankruptcy was completed. Ironically Anton signed the final closuredocument on April 29,1993 - twenty-seven years exactly from the date of the founding of the Church ofSatan - according to his“Unknown Known” prescription in the Satanic Rituals the “zenith of intensity” ofthe Workingcommenced in 1984 with Diane’s departure from 6114 and decision to commencelegal action againsthim.This final closure document and its supplement (Appendices #159-160), however,gave Diane littlesatisfaction for the nine long years of exhaustive lawsuit. Anton hadsuccessfully prevented 6114 from788 “Barton, Blanche”, “Secretary of the Church of Satan”, “Representation vs.Misrepresentation”, The Black Flame #5, Fall/Winter XXVI/1991.789 Declaration of Jane Grieco in Support of Renewal of Motion for Relief fromAutomatic Stay and Automatic Protection, Chapter 7 Case#91-34251, March 27, 1992.790 Grieco, Jane, Declaration in opposition to debtor’s request for dismissal,Chapter 7 Case #91-34251, August 17, 1992.791 Benford, Elizabeth, Creditor’s opposition to debtor’s request for dismissal,Chapter 7 Case #91-34251, August 17, 1992.792 Carlson, Judge Thomas E., Order denying debtor’s motion for dismissal andcontinuing proceedings in Chapter 7, Chapter 7 Case#91-34251, August 27, 1992.793 Werby allowed Anton LaVey to continue to live in the house for the rest ofhis life.- 431 -being placed on the open market for sale, by his resistance to vacating thepremises or presenting thehouse in an attractive condition. In addition to the repulsive interiorcondition of the house as noted byDiane’s attorneys above, its exterior was allowed to deteriorate as well, withlarge areas of paint peelingoff the front facade.Therefore, when Werby renewed his offer of $240,000, Diane was virtually forcedto accept - and inreturn for Anton’s agreeing to waive his claim of a $50,000 “homestead”exemption [which, if furthercontested by Diane, would merely have dragged out the asset-draining bankruptcythat much longer]agreed to allow him to keep all of “his personal property” - which presumablymeant everything on the1985 LaVey/Hegarty agreement which was their joint property [and the SuperiorCourt had ordereddivided as such].Diane probably agreed to this settlement because of the looming danger thatcontinued contest in thebankruptcy court would ultimately result in all of the remaining assetsdwindling away.Even with this settlement, the $240,000 was immediately trimmed to $196,950 bybankruptcy courtand court attorney costs, to which would still be added estate tax accountant &attorney costs, Diane’sown legal costs ($30,000 at the conclusion of the Superior Court case - notcounting the subsequentbankruptcy actions), and the $300 Superior Court costs.By his bankruptcy maneuver Anton had succeeded in almost destroying the assetsthat the SuperiorCourt had said that Diane rightfully deserved for her long years of love andsupport, and selflessdedication to him. Through the arrangement of a rock-bottom sale price of 6114California Street toWerby, he had also managed to continue to live in that house rent-free.The Devil’s Notebook was finally published as a slim paperback in 1992 - aselection of Anton’s essaysfrom the old Cloven Hoof - and is reviewed in Appendix #161. It received neithertrade reviews norexposure in major bookstores, nor attention from the public.In 1994 shock-rock musician Marilyn Manson was asked by Anton to visit 6114.“Near the end of ourvisit,” recounted Manson, “he said ‘I want to make you a reverend’ and gave me acrimson card certifyingme as a minister in the Church of Satan. It seemed then - and it still does -that my ordainment (sic) wassimply a gesture of respect. It was like an honorary degree from a university.”794The Church of Satan’s final splash in San Francisco before Anton LaVey’s deathtook place on May 7,1997, when another of his latter-day “priests” made an appearance at a localparty for the 49ers footballteam:“Rev. Stephen Leyba calls his self-styled ritual the ‘Apache Whiskey Rite’,”said the San FranciscoChronicle. “It includes having a Satanic pentagram carved in his back, and beingurinated upon by othermembers of his troupe.” 795 “I took off the headdress,” added Leyba for theChannel 7 television news thefollowing day, “and then I was urinated on my back into a blood bowl, and then Idrank the urine and theblood.” 796 San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who hastily left the party at thatpoint, was heard to mutteron his way out the door, “What a fucked-up city!” 797Too ill and weak to negotiate the stairs, Anton spent his last months sleepingon the couch in thePurple Room. He died October 29, 1997 at St. Mary’s Hospital in San Francisco ofpulmonary edema (aform of heart disease resulting from high blood pressure, in which the lungsfill with fluid). A falsified“October 31” death certificate was issued, which, when she discovered the cheapstunt, Zeena angrily [andsuccessfully] ordered corrected. 798794 Manson, Marilyn, “Running with the Devil” in Spin magazine, February 1998.795 San Francisco Chronicle, May 8, 1997, page #A19.796 Channel 7 Evening News, San Francisco, May 9, 1997.797 San Francisco Chronicle, May 8, 1997, page #A2.798 Certificate of Death #380270667, City & County of San Francisco, November26, 1997; Affidavit to Amend a Record, Zeena & NikolasSchreck.- 432 -Sharon Densley managed to keep Anton’s terminal illness and death secret untilNovember 6, when aSan Francisco television station learned of it and mentioned it in their eveningnews - which was the firstDiane and Zeena had heard about it.

Complained that he never got any local ink. Didn’tbelieve in the Devil, asit turned out. It was all an act for a marketing niche. “It’s a living,” as heput it.

The role stuck: LaVey kept apet tarantula and roamedthe streets in a black cape. 800At the time of Anton’s death, both Densley and Karla LaVey cooperatively claimedto be joint “HighPriestesses” of the Church of Satan. A year later each was adamantly denying theother’s legitimacy beforethe “empty theater” of a disinterested public. 801On June 17-23, 1998 the S.F. Weekly newspaper published an article by JackBoulware, a longtimeAnton LaVey fan, entitled “Has the Church of Satan Gone to Hell?”, whichchronicled the rise and fall ofthat institution and its founder. Quick to distance herself - and her husband,through whose financialgenerosity Anton had been able to live on at 6114 past his bankruptcy - wasWillie Werby, whoindignantly wrote the Editor:My husband Don and I became friends of Anton LaVey in 1958, years before he - orhis PR man -thought up the Church of Satan. At the time we were involved with Camera ObscuraFilm Society andshared his interest in movies. We were never involved with the Church of Satanin any way. Never joined.Never attended a mass or ceremony. And we emphatically did not dine on a humanleg (yuck!).I never even heard of a “Magic Circle”, nor Forrest Ackerman, nor a “dildomanufacturer”. Mr.Boulware, who showed such intelligent skepticism about the famous LaVeybackground, accepted thesedetails with utter credulity. The book in question - I forget the title - waswritten by someone named BurtonWolfe, who got all his “facts” directly from Anton, without checking them.The closest we came was attending Anton’s Halloween parties - until a group ofguys showed up inNazi uniforms, which made us uncomfortable - and we ended the practice. 802799 Carroll, Jerry, “Devil of a Time”, San Francisco Chronicle, November 7,1997, page #C2.800 “Milestones”, Time magazine, November 17, 1997, page #37.801 “Barton, Blanche”, Internet message, October 31, 1998; LaVey, Karla,Internet web page letter, October 29, 1998.802 Werby, Willy, letter to the Editor, S.F. Weekly, July 1-7. 1998.- 433 -Nor, now that Anton was dead, did it seem that Burton Wolfe was anxious to beassociated with himany longer. On July 9th, Adam Parfrey of Feral House (which published Anton’slast few books)commented on the Internet:I just received from Burton Wolfe, author of the first Anton LaVey biography,The Devil’s Avenger, a20-page missive regarding his threatened lawsuit against the S.F. Weekly. Itseems that the flurry of anti-LaVey misconceptions are really hurting this gentleman, not as a member of theChurch of Satan (he neverwas), or as a LaVey supporter (he disagreed with much of what Anton thought andsaid), but as a journalist!Wolfe doesn’t want to be libeled as an individual who invented lies for AntonLaVey!803That same year Parfrey published a final collection of Anton’s essays, entitledSatan Speaks.“Fortunately for me and for all of us,” said Marilyn Manson in his Introduction,“Anton LaVey shared hismagic, and I think it has made this wretched, fucking planet a better place.”804The Satan Speaks essays were, in a word, embarrassing - being simply one aimlessrant after another,including several going into graphic detail about Anton’s ultimate passion:... the act of urinating in one’s panties. A well-planned, well-executed publicspectacle is a goal of the mostdedicated panty pissers. Panty pissing is a fetish which gives pleasure to theviewer but, more importantly,to the perpetrator. It need not serve as a prelude to sexual intercourse butrather as an exciting and gratifyingact in and of itself.805A year after Anton LaVey’s death, Densley and her relatives were evicted from6114 California Street,despite her appeals to LaVey followers to buy the house for her.806 When Zeenaand Nikolas Schreck wentto the house a few days later to supervise removal and storage of any remainingmementos, they found itunbelievably filthy, with mold infesting the refrigerator and a half-inch ofgrease built up along thecountertops. Even Werby’s own company advised me that the building haddegenerated far past the pointof any restoration; it was suitable only for demolition.For four years the empty house sat silently between the modern apartmentbuildings on either side ofit, its paint peeling, shutters falling off, and front yard filled with refuse:just another derelict prop fromthe ghost town of The Devil’s Rain. Yet, eerily, it seemed that no one dared totouch it. One recalls, fromThea von Harbou’s original Metropolis:There was a house in the great Metropolis which was older than the town. Manysaid that it was older,even, than the cathedral, and, before the Archangel Michael raised his voice asadvocate in the conflict forGod, the house stood there in its evil gloom, defying the cathedral from out itsdull eyes.It had lived through the time of smoke and soot. Every year which passed overthe city seemed to creep,when dying, into this house, so that, at last it was a cemetery - a coffin,filled with dead tens of years.Set into the black wood of the door stood, copper-red, mysterious, the seal ofSolomon, the pentagram.It was said that a magician, who came from the East (and in the track of whomthe plague wandered),had built the house in seven nights. But the masons and carpenters of the towndid not know who hadmortared the bricks, nor who had erected the roof. No foreman's speech and noribboned nosegay hadhallowed the Builder's Feast after the pious custom. The chronicles of the townheld no record of when themagician died, nor of how he died. One day it occurred to the citizens as oddthat the red shoes of themagician had so long shunned the abominable plaster of the town. Entrance wasforced into the house and803 Parfrey, Adam, alt.satanism Usenet Internet newsgroup, July 9, 1998.804 Manson, Marilyn, Foreword to LaVey, Anton, Satan Speaks. Venice, California:Feral House, 1998.805 LaVey, Anton, “Panty Pissers”, Ibid. page 74.806 “Barton, Blanche”, Internet letter on “Satannet” web page, June 15, 1998.- 434 -not a living soul was found inside. But the rooms, which received, neither byday nor by night, a ray fromthe great lights of the sky, seemed to be waiting for their master, sunken insleep. Parchments and folios layabout, open, under a covering of dust, like silver-grey velvet.Set in all the doors stood, copper-red, mysterious, the seal of Solomon, thepentagram.Then came a time which pulled down antiquities. Then the words were spoken: Thehouse must die.But the house was stronger than the words, as it was stronger than thecenturies. With suddenly-fallingstones it slew those who laid hands on its walls. It opened the floor undertheir feet, dragging them downinto a shaft, of which no man had previously had any knowledge. It was as thoughthe plague, which hadformerly wandered in the wake of the red shoes of the magician, still crouchedin the corners of the narrowhouse, springing out at men from behind, to seize them by the neck. They died,and no doctor knew theillness. The house resisted its destruction with so great a force that word ofits malignity went out over theborders of the city, spreading far over the land, that, at last, there was nohonest man to be found who wouldhave ventured to make war against it. Yes, even the thieves and the rogues, whowere promised remission oftheir sentence provided that they declared themselves ready to pull down themagician's house, preferred togo to the pillory, or even to the scaffold, rather than to enter within thesespiteful walls, these latchlessdoors, which were sealed with Solomon's seal ...6114 California Street decided that it would leave this world on October 16,2001 (curiously, mybirthday). In a single day it was destroyed, and the wreckers instantly removedthe rubble so thoroughlythat only a level plot of earth remained.In 2008 a new three-unit condominium (6112, 6114, 6118) was built on the lot.6118 occupied theentire second floor, where the fabulous rooms of the old 6114 would have been.Purely coincidentally afake fireplace exists in approximately the same location as the massive one inthe old main ritual chamber,and a circular iron stairway retraces the old route from the Den of Iniquity tothe fireplace-door in thePurple Room. Replacing the Den on the ground floor is a recreation room, andabove it a modern kitchenwith countertop is where the Purple Room used to be.* * * * *As was the case with Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, one watches Anton LaVey’signominious self-destruction with mixed feelings. That he made his own Procrustean bed is beyonddoubt. But, likeSaruman, he was once a true artist, a profound philosopher, and above all anauthentic magician.To the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of Saruman a grey mistgathered, and rising slowlyto a great height like smoke from a fire, as a pale shrouded figure it loomedover the hill. For a moment itwavered, looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bentaway, and with a sighdissolved into nothing.Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemedthat long years of deathwere suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the shriveled face became ragsof skin upon a hideous skull.Lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered itover, and turned away. 807Called again to mind is Abraham Merritt’s Seven Footprints to Satan, in whichthe Kheft-dispensing“Satan”, in a reflective mood, responds to his current guest/victim’s questionconcerning the motivesunderlying his brilliant and fantastic, yet wanton and cruel lifestyle:Call it - amusement. It is for amusement that I exist. It is for that alone thatI remain upon a world inwhich, when all is said and done, amusement in some form or guise is the onegreat aim of all, the onlything that makes life upon it tolerable. My aim is, therefore, you perceive, asimple one. But what is it thatamuses me?807 Tolkien, op. cit. , page #III-300.- 435 -Three things. I am a great playwright, the greatest that has ever lived, sincemy plays are real. I set thescenes for my little single acts, my farces and comedies, dramas and tragedies,my epics. I direct the actors.I am the sole audience that can see every action, hear every line of my playsfrom beginning to end.Sometimes what began as a farce turns into high tragedy, tragedies becomefarces, a one-act diversiondevelops into an epic, governments fall, the mighty topple from their pedestals,the lowly are exalted. Somepeople live their lives for chess. I play my chess with living chessmen, and Iplay a score of games at oncein all corners of the world. All this amuses me. Furthermore, in my character asPrince of Darkness, which Iperceive that you do not wholly admit, my art puts me on a par with that othersuper-dramatist, my ancientand Celestial adversary known according to the dominant local creed as Jehovah.Nay, it places me higher -since I rewrite his script. This also amuses me.The second? I am a lover of beauty. It is, indeed, the one thing that can arousein me what may be called- emotion. It happens now and then that man with his mind and eyes and heart andhands makes visible andmanifest some thing which bears that stamp of creative perfection the monopolyof which tradition ascribesto the same Celestial adversary I have named. It may be a painting, a statue, acarved bit of wood, a crystal,a vase, a fabric - any one of ten thousand things. But in it is that essence ofbeauty humanity calls divineand for which, in its blundering way, it is always seeking - as it is amusement.The best of these things Imake from time to time my own. But - I will not have them come to me except bymy own way. Here entersthe third element - the gamble, the game.Collector of souls and beauty I am. Gambler am I, too, and as supreme in that asin my collecting. It isthe unknown quantity, the risk, that sharpens the edge of my enjoyment of myplays. It is what gives thefinal zest to my - acquirements. And I am a generous opponent. The stakes thosewho play with me may winare immeasurably greater than any I could win from them. But play with me - theymust!808The tragedy of Merritt’s “Satan”, like that of Anton LaVey, is that he cheatedwhen he didn’t have to,falsified his own character when the authentic one was uniquely admirable,deceived disciples whoadmired and respected his wisdom, devastated the woman who devoted her life tohim, and betrayed thePrince of Darkness whose name he had taken as a part of himself. At theconclusion of Seven Footprintsthe horrified protagonist sees “Satan” for one last time:For Satan, stumbling towards us, was blind!His eyes were no longer blue, jewel-hard, and jewel-bright. They were dull andgray, like unpolishedagates. They were dead. It was as though a flame had seared them.One arm hung limp. The other clasped to his breast a little statue of ivory, anEros. Of all those things ofbeauty which he had schemed and robbed and slain to possess, that statue was, Ithink, the thing he lovedthe best; the thing in which he found the purest, perfect form of that spirit ofbeauty which, evil as Satanwas, he knew and worshipped.He stumbled on, rolling his great head from side to side like a blinded beast.And as he came, tears fellsteadily from the sightless eyes and glistened on the heavy cheeks. 809One cannot despise such a person, nor even feel pity at such a spectacle. LikeFrodo, one feels rather acertain dismay, an embarrassment at merely witnessing it.For a 1986 Washington Post Magazine Anton was photographed standing against anold stone wall athis beloved Land’s End in San Francisco, the Sun setting over the Pacific Oceanbehind him. Though cladinevitably in black hat and trench coat, he holds in one massive hand a delicatered rosebud. Perhaps thereis no more fitting way to remember him than thus: a creature of the setting Sun,enveloped in darkness,torn between genius at once creative and self-destructive, yet drawn always tothe beautiful, the mystical,and the magical.808 Merritt, Abraham, Seven Footprints to Satan. Boni & Liveright, 1928.809 Ibid.- 436 -This history, then, is finally a protest against the pitiless erosion of timewhich otherwise would causethe story of Anton Szandor LaVey and the Church of Satan to fade and beforgotten - or, worse, to betwisted into propagandistic fiction both pro and con by exploitive extremists.The Church of Satan is too significant to humanity to be unknown andunremembered. It grappledwith intense questions of mankind’s nature, capabilities, and consequence with aboldness and a tenacitynever previously approached. It ultimately reached a point beyond which it couldnot go, but its final crisisbrought about the creation of a successor to envision and realize new horizons:the Temple of Set.[index-437_1.jpg]- 437 -In The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) L. Frank Baum had his imperiled hero Tip (thefuture PrincessOzma) tie together two sofas, palm branches (for wings), a broom (for a tail)and the stuffed head of agump (in Oz an elk-like creature) with rope and clothesline, sprinkle it withmagic powder to bring it tolife, and then use it to fly away to safety. 810 Nevertheless, as evident fromthe improvised haste of itsassembly, the gump was sorely wanting in ærodynamics, and only barely broughtits passengers to alanding before falling apart. Tip granted its wish to be disassembled, thoughthe stuffed head remainedalive and continued to startle bypassers with comments throughout, presumably,the rest of the thirteenoriginal Oz books.The Church of Satan, founded in 1966, was a bit like Baum’s gump. It was alsothrown together inimprovised haste from a variety of vaguely- or un-related concepts and then usedto transport its riders onan unpredictably soaring, plunging, and haphazard journey throughout the nextnine years until its owncatastrophic crash in 1975. Like the gump, it did complete the journey; alsolike the gump, it is somethingof an amazement that it got off the ground at all, much less flew as long and asfar as it did.811 “If I hadn’tlived through it myself,” more than one old Satanist has remarked to me uponreading The Church ofSatan, “I would have found it almost too bizarre to believe.”So how should we judge our gump? Was it a success or a failure? Was Anton LaVeya genius or amadman? Were the members of the Church pioneers or fools? Ultimately was thisentire episoder aphenomenon of importance and consequence in human history, or merely a bizarrediversion: a decade-long Halloween party?Let’s begin by examining the mainstream religious environment of Westerncivilization in the 1960s:Judaism and its various Christianity “sequels”. From a conceptual standpoint,Judæo/Christianity is, in aword, absurd: a Brothers Grimm-like rag-bag of borrowed and crudely-concoctedsadomasochistic myths.Institutionally J/C is a 2,000-year-continuous train wreck of war, persecution,schism, genocide,exploitation, and subjugation. It is a mind-drug which thrives on human poverty,misery, and stupidity. [Inthe East, this terrible legacy is equalled, if not surpassed by Judaism’s otherbastard child, Islam.]If this is so, why has this hydra survived and indeed prospered for so long? Whyhasn’t it been thrownonto the trash-heap of failed experiments? Why do so many people - includingintelligent, educated ones -cling to it? The answer is that it promises an answer to and escape from themystery of death, and itssolution is the simple one of mere “blind faith”. That such faith has no moresubstance than that in theEaster Bunny or Tooth Fairy is irrelevant. “If no one will write new detectivestories,” observed JohnFowles in his Aristos, “then people will still read the old ones.”810 The gump was included in Walt Disney’s 1985 film Return to Oz, being acomposite of Baum’s Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. Inthis film Dorothy Gale was substituted for Tip as the gump’s creator & rider.811 Arguably its stuffed head - an Anton LaVey fan club using the Church’s name- has also remained “alive and commenting” since theauthentic Church’s 1975 disintegration.- 438 -With the Enlightenment, literal Judæo/Christianity lost its credibility at leastamong the intellectualelites; thereafter it became essentially a propaganda tool for control of themasses. Its professed piety andmorality, never that exemplary to begin with, became the stuff of socialridicule; “religion” and“hypocrisy” were so synonymous as to be, by the mid-20th century, unremarkable.As developed in this history, Anton LaVey saw an opportunity to make a dramaticestatement rejectingthis hypocrisy, and it seemed reasonable that the standard-bearer of thisrejection should be none otherthan the J/C Devil. Suddenly, ironically, the most authentically moral people onthe block were theSatanists, if only because they openly acknowledged and embraced theirimperfections. As in Sundog’sreview of Satanis in Chapter 6:“Yeah, before I joined the Satanic Church I masturbated once a day and was veryunhappy about it.Now I masturbate three or four times a day and really dig it.”The second thing that first Anton, then other Satanists did was to “write abetter detective story”. Theelectrifying message of Rosemary’s Baby was that Satanists could tap intoknowledge and powers ofwhich Jews and Christians are utterly ignorant. Why live life as a slave whenyou could do it as a god?And last but hardly least, Satanism was fun. Why would you want to sit in asynagogue or church pewand be bored by tired, turgid tedium when you could stand amidst blazing torchesbefore an altar drapedwith a living Playboy centerfold, howling your most delectable desires to dæmonsand monsters?So the Church of Satan didn’t start out as a metaphysical philosophy, but as asocial statementaccented with mystery and fun. To that end Anton LaVey was superbly suited to beits spokesman andsymbol.What happened next, however, was something no one - including Anton -anticipated or was preparedto deal with: The Church of Satan started to take itself seriously. It began toconstruct an organizationalpresence beyond Friday night spook parties at Anton’s place, and to develop botha philosophical and ametaphysical explanation for itself and its adherents. Razzing J/C was no longerenough; the new agendawas to expose, destroy, and supplant it. “I foresee a day,” said Anton to ArtLyons in 197o, “whencommunities will be alive with churches bearing tridents and pentagrams on theirsteeples.” These to becomplemented by ornately-decadent Pleasure Domes for sybaritic Bacchanalia, likean endlessly-loopedKenneth Anger film.As things turned out, unfortunately, there were five problems with this utopianvision:The first was that Satan and his Dæmons were concepts within the mythology andiconography of J/C.God could not be destroyed without taking Satan down along with him, as thelatter realized in AnatoleFrance’s Revolt of the Angels. 812 What the Church of Satan tried to do,consequently, was to construct anew identity and persona for Satan, and a new rationale for the Powers ofDarkness, independent of J/C.Satanists were receptive to this, obviously, but outside the cocoon of theChurch of Satan, the much largerpopulation of Jews, Christians, and others entrained by if not personallyprofessing J/C culture, went righton thinking of the Devil the way they always had: as the person, symbol, orforce of evil. Over and overagain in its interactions with the public, the Church of Satan ran into thisstone wall, and no amount ofargument, no matter how emphatic or articulate, dented it. A completelydisproportionate amount ofSatanists’ public-relations time and energy was consumed by this futile effort.Second, no one actually set out to construct the Church of Satan as afunctioning organization. Antonand Diane LaVey kept all decision-making power to themselves, didn’t get aroundto formalizing theChurch as a nonprofit religious corporation until 1971, and then promptlyignored the federal/staterecognition requirements of that action. By the time of their “palimony” lawsuitin the 1980s, neither oneof them even thought of the Church as anything other than a “personal business”.812 Excerpted in Chapter 5.- 439 -Beyond the front door of 6114, the Church of Satan had begun to organize itselfduring the 1970-75period. I wrote a handbook to establish basic procedures for Grottos, and aninstitutional identity began toshow signs of emerging through regional conclaves and exchanged newsletters.There was no sense ofurgency to this evolution, however, and the LaVeys went from being initiallyenthusiastic about it todeliberately obstructionist. Hence until its collapse in 1975 the Churchremained a very amateur operation.The best that can be said about this is that none of us felt that there was anyneed for hurry: “Tomorrowbelonged to us”, and we had plenty of time to work out such details.Third, Anton LaVey was not cut out to be a CEO. He was an artist, an egoist, anda 19th centuryRomantic decadent. He enjoyed the Church of Satan as a personal expression andentourage in the 1960s,and as an equally-personal nostalgic fantasy after 1975. What he neitherexpected or enjoyed was therealization in the early 1970s that he had set in motion something much biggerand more complex thanhimself, and in whose development he would be simply one of many cogs [despitebeing the first and mostimportant one].For her part Diane LaVey obviously did a valiant and tireless job of trying tointegrate and reconcileher husband and his Church. This despite the fact that she too had no formaltraining in businessadministration or organizational management. Like Indiana Jones, she simply“figured it out as she went”,and most of the “figuring” was personal: 6114 volunteers dropped in and droppedout, and others likemyself were too distant from San Francisco for hands-on administration. By 1974it was becoming clearthat Anton and Diane were both about to reach the ends of their respectiveropes. What was not so clearwas what might happen when they did.Fourth, the Church of Satan Grottos and members-at-large, both within andwithout San Francisco,proved far more mercurial and problematic than anyone expected. As documentedherein, Anton soughthigh intelligence, morality, and dignity in Church applicants - especially sofor the Priesthood. He did getsome of this calibre, but unfortunately they were both outnumbered andout-squeakywheeled by “problemchildren”: quirkoids who assumed that the Church of Satan would welcome themwhen no other religioncould stand them. There were sexual deviants of the sort highlighted in TheDevil’s Avenger. There werereligious fanatics with a burning hatred of J/C. There were those who weresimply Anton LaVey fans.There were dilettantes who were seeking the ultimate in shock-stimulation. Whenthese “maxed out theirred charge cards”, they caused trouble. Since the LaVeys reserved expulsiondecisions to themselves, thislanded the trouble on their doorstep, and finally they got fed up with it.813First they halted all activities attheir home. Next they became much more reluctant to charter Grottos or elevateanyone to the Priesthood.Finally they decided to strangle the organized Church into nonexistence, so thata mythical “Church” andan even greater mythical “Movement” could take its place. Actual Churchaffiliation would have nogreater meaning than a fan club. Absent any official or organizationalentanglements, “problem children”could then be expelled with a finger-snap.Fifth, the Church of Satan was Anton LaVey’s “profession”, but it was not amoney-maker. At $13 tojoin and $10/year to renew, it [with at most a membership of about 250] broughtin [assuming 50%turnover] perhaps $3,000/year. The only thing the Church sold 1970-75 weremember-only Baphometmedallions, which cost $3.50 and sold for $7, and moved only with infrequentdegree-changes. For everycopy of the Satanic Bible sold, Anton told me that he received a 10¢ royalty,presumably the same for theSatanic Rituals and shorter-lived Compleat Witch. Doubtless Anton made somemoney from consultationsand public appearances, but these would not have been frequent or substantial.Not to mention that part ofAnton’s carefully-crafted public image was that of the Black Pope of aworldwide, 25,ooo+memberChurch, with several lavish estates, exotic cars, and even a fleet of ships[thus going Scientology founderL. Ron Hubbard’s “Sea Org” one better]. The picture which would later emergefrom Anton & Diane’s813 Also on their doorstep, literally, were regular drive-by visits from paint-or rock-throwing [or occasionally gun-firing] vandals. Oneevening while I was visiting 6114, a man wearing nothing but a leopardskin rangthe doorbell and announced that he had arrived from Africato confer with “his brother Anton”.- 440 -legal cases suggests a far more precarious reality; and one consequence ofAnton’s public fame was that,unlike less-conspicuous Church members, he could hardly get a “day job” as anordinary private-sectoremployee. The reality of his 1975 decision to sell the Church’s degrees,including the Priesthood, may boildown to simple financial desperation, coupled with the assumption that theglamor and prestige which thenational Priesthood had earned over the years had made it quick-cash-marketable.[My offer at the time topursue alternate fund-raising efforts may have seemed too slow and uncertain bycomparison.]The cumulative effect of these five essential defects of the Church of Satan wasto invoke Brien’s FirstLaw: that “eventually an organization’s ability to succeed in spite of itselfruns out”. What energized theChurch for ten years was anti-hypocrisy, mystery, and fun. What disintegrated itwas an inherently-falsemythology, nonorganization, an inspirational leader unsuited to an executiverole, persisting membershipdisfunctionality, and constricting finances.As this history recounts and documents, this situation was not nearly so evidentduring those ten yearsof ostensible success. Indeed there were trends and directions within the Churchthat, with time and luck,might have changed the outcome:(1) By 1970 the Church had begun to move away from its initial, simple anti-J/Crhetoric towards firstthe multiculturalism of the Satanic Rituals and the Cloven Hoof, and then agradual reconceptualization ofSatan and Satanism as ideas unique and positive in their own right.(2) By 1972 the Manual for Grotto Administration and Anton LaVey’sincreasingly-rigorous standardsfor the Priesthood indicated that at least initial steps towards a formalorganizational structure wereunderway.(3) Although the nationwide explosion of interest, affiliation, and local groupsof the Church of Satancaught Anton LaVey by surprise, he clearly made several years’ effort to adaptto executiveresponsibilities. So, simultaneously, did Diane [more successfully, since shedid not have Anton’s id-monster to contend with].814(4) As time passed, the initial social freak/outcast membership of the Church ofSatan began to giveway to more mature, principled applicants, reflecting increasingly selectiveadmission standards. By 1975there were still some “problem children” around, but the trend was definitelyaway from them.(5) By 1971 the Church of Satan was formalized by Anton LaVey as a nonprofitreligious corporation.Had that been adhered to, he would not have “quit his day job” [as an author,lecturer, artist, consultant] tobecome financially dependant upon it. Had the Church’s initial organizationalefforts continued,eventually they would have had to harmonize with this nonprofit corporatestructure. As High Priest/corporate president, Anton legitimately could have been paid salary andexpenses, though he could notconfiscate dues, fees, or gifts to the Church.None of these positive trends happened quickly or sufficiently enough tocounteract the correspondingnegative pressures. Hence the crisis of 1975, which produced a Dr. Jekyll/Mr.Hyde result:Jekyll: The founders of the Temple of Set created a successor organization whichfrom the moment ofits inception avoided all of the five crippling problems. (a) It disassociateditself absolutely and completelyfrom J/C. (b) It immediately incorporated itself as a nonprofit church, obtainedfederal and stateexemption as such, and established By-Laws to codify its administrativefunctions and comply withcorporate requirements. (c) The High Priesthood of Set was designated the CEO,but a corporate board ofdirectors (Council of Nine) was established to oversee it, and an ExecutiveDirectorship created toseparate administrative from religious functions. (d) Admission and expulsionauthority was decentralizedto the Priesthood, and all initiatory degrees were subject toappropriately-progressive nomination, review,and confirmation procedures. (e) The Temple was configured to support onlyitself financially, in keepingwith its nonprofit incorporation.814 In the 1956 movie Forbidden Planet, the human Dr. Morbius had hisconsciousness artificially boosted by alien technology. Unfortunatelyalong with his rational intellect, the machine boosted his subconscious, primalid into a monster of raw, animal emotion. Only Morbius’suicide halted his id’s destructive rampage.[index-441_1.jpg]- 441 -Hyde: Anton LaVey [with Diane standing by him for several more years] snappedback to being asolitary artist and egoist. His subsequent life and lifestyle revolvedabsolutely and unreservedly around hisdesires, dreams, dislikes, and fetishes. The “Church of Satan” became a fantasyto be pretended as desiredto the public. Those joining it (now for $100) joined nothing more than a fanclub, as has continued to bethe case since Anton’s 1997 death.“Satanism”, curiously enough, has evolved independently. Jettisoned by theTemple of Set and used byAnton simply as a personal adjective, the concept began to be reenvisioned byindividuals attracted by itsspooky glamor. This interpretation became increasingly synonymous with a kind ofarrogant, symbolicatheism, for which there is no doctrinal consensus or organization. Likeexistentialism and anarchism, thisnew “satanatheism” has become something descriptive, not prescriptive, bringingagain to mind MilesDavis’ “I’ll play it first and tell you what it is later.” The Achilles’ heel ofthis whimsical affectation issimply that outside its eclectic circle the same old world of ordinary Jews,Christians, Muslims, and thosesocialized by them still consider “Satan” and “Satanism” synonymous with pureevil. For the narcissisticthrill of calling themselves “Satanists”, satanatheists have merely madethemselves conspicuous andvulnerable targets for mainstream prejudice.When I am asked whether the ten-year flight of the Church of Satan’s gump was“worth it”, myresponse is an unhesitating and unqualifed “yes”. Without that crucible, thatconfrontation with existingsociety and its smothering dullness, those of us who would later found theTemple of Set might never haveexperienced the requisite awakening to that much larger philosophical andmetaphysical universe. If allthe Church of Satan accomplished was that, it justified itself no less thanColumbus did when hemistakenly landed in the Bahamas and called the local residents “Indians”.As for Anton LaVey, the simple fact is that there would not have been thatChurch of Satan withouthim. Something that outrageous required an equally outrageous genius or maniac(take your choice) toimagine and create it. The gump required Tip to think it up, lash it together,and bring it to life. It was ahorrifying hodge-podge, but it flew for as long as necessary to save the day.- 442 -- 443 -Table of Plates1.Anton LaVey, 1970 - In my opinion the best studio photograph ever taken of him.2.Anton and Diane LaVey on the front steps of their home at 6114 CaliforniaStreet, San Francisco,1973.3.Immediately behind the front door of 6114 was this entrance hall, leading northto the Purple Room(the living/sitting/social/interview room). Halfway along the hall to the leftwas the principal door tothe main ritual chamber (seen in the documentary film Satanis as well asnumerous publicityphotos). This photograph is taken from the Purple Room looking south to thefront door.4.On the walls of the Purple Room were four large and one small oil paintings byAnton LaVey,painted, I believe, prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. This is one ofthe large ones.5.Anton’s small oil painting in the Purple Room.6.Another of Anton’s large oil paintings in the Purple Room.7.Another of Anton’s large oil paintings in the Purple Room.8.The northwest wall of the Purple Room, from the entrance hall. In the alcove atthe left can beglimpsed the top of a barber chair. At the far left is a bookcase which could beswung open to revealthe doorway west into the Red Room. Peering at visitors from atop the bookcasewas a stuffed rat.The [fake] fireplace at the right could be swung open to reveal a ladder to thebasement (Den ofIniquity). [Since the Purple Room was the “visitors’ room” of 6114, Anton'sfavorite entrance was,not inappropriately, through the fireplace!] At the upper right is another ofAnton’s large oil paintingswith a giant fly-like creature departing from a flaming tower. At the bottomright of the fireplacebookshelf is a framed photograph of Diane petting Togare as a tiny cub, lying onhis back.9.Through a door at the north of the Purple Room was the kitchen and dining room,paintedcompletely black with striking wall murals. I do not know whether these muralswere painted byAnton personally or by friends of his. This “Night on Bald Mountain” mural wasagainst the westwall, behind which was the bathroom containing an old claw-footed bathtub with alarge octopuspainted on its side. Another door on the southwest side of the kitchen led southto the Red Room(Anton & Diane’s bedroom and his office).10. The north wall of the kitchen. The door led to the back porch, and downstairs to the back yard. Theyard was generally in an overgrown, wild state. The back porch contained Togarethe lion’s cagewhen he lived at 6114.11. The Red Room (Anton and Diane LaVey’s bedroom. This photo is taken towardsthe northeastcorner. To the north was a door to the kitchen, to the east a door through theswinging bookcase tothe Purple Room. To the south was a door leading first to a small roomcontaining a trapdoor andladder down to the Den of Iniquity and then through the King Tut door into themain ritual chamber.Within the Red Room was Anton & Diane’e elevated double bed, and underneath thebed hispersonal office. Diane’s office, and the Church of Satan’s administrative files,were on the building’ssecond story, behind the small window visible on front external photographs ofthe building. Alsoupstairs were the private rooms of the LaVey children. The walls of the Red Roomwere decorated- 444 -with Anton’s collection of medieval torture implements and weapons, including aThompsonsubmachine gun.12. Situated below the kitchen was the main basement room, a lounge with wetbarcalled the Den ofIniquity. It was populated by mannequins created and modified by Anton, andwhich changed overthe years. In this 1973 photo the bartender mannequin wears a rubber Devil-maskmodeled afterAnton’s face. At the far left is a Rock-Ola juke box, at the base of whichsprawls the mannequin of ayoung child (apparently drunk). The original plastic inside-thighs of thegirl-mannequin at centerwere replaced with foam rubber to make them more natural to the touch. The moreelegantly-dressedgirl mannequin at the far right wears an expression of agony and hopelessness onher face; her dressis hiked to her thighs, exposing them to the gaze of the sexually-aroused sailormannequin. She facesthe door north to the mirrored Blue Room (by 1973 remodeled into a “fleabaghotel room”). To theeast of the Den was a second small private office of Anton’s, also containingthe ladder up throughthe Purple Room’s fireplace. Also in this small room was a floor-trapdoor whichAnton told me leddown to cavernous sewers and storm drains all the way to the Land’s End cliffs.No suchLovecraftian catacombs were unearthed when 6114 was torn down, but it made agood spooky story!To the south of the Den (under the main ritual chamber) was the garage,originally housing Anton’sCord and later his blue 3.8 Jaguar sedan. His “daily” car - first a blackOldsmobile Toronado andlater a black Buick sedan (chauffeured by Tony Fazzini) were parked on thestreet out front. Througha southwest door from the Den, in a room beneath the entrance hallway and to theeast of the garage,was the most exclusive and private ritual chamber, the Council Chamber, alsoused for meetings ofthe Council of Nine. Its altar (Plate #15) was against the north wall.13. The fireplace/altar in 6114’s main ritual chamber, constructed, said Anton,from cobblestones brokenup in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The fireplace is nonfunctional, butcontains a small electricmock-fire. Atop the mantel is the Toledo-steel sword whose duplicate wasoriginally held by the waxfigure in the Fisherman’s Wharf Church of Satan exhibit. Behind it are a humanskull, a bell, aflame-brazier, a ram-headed chalice, and an Egyptian canopic jar which Antonclaimed containedsome of the ashes of Dracula author Bram Stoker.14. Looking towards the north of the main ritual chamber. Behind Anton’s Yamahaorgan is the doorwayleading to the Red Room, this one covered with a reproduction of Tutankhamen’smummy-case. Theeyes of the mummy are cut out, so that someone standing behind it can peerthrough. Immediatelybehind the mummy-door are the trap door and ladder leading to the Den ofIniquity in the basement.15. The altar in the basement Council Chamber.16. Poster from the Tyrone Power film Nightmare Alley in the kitchen.17. To the west of the kitchen was the bathroom containing the sink and bathtub,and at the north end ofthe bathroom was a separate small room for the toilet. Painted completely black,this room containedamenities such as a World War I surplus gas mask and a vase with roses. Whenseated and with thedoor closed, an occupant stared at one of the famous “Satan Wants You” posters.18. Howard Levy’s Cub Scout membership card. I guess it didn’t take!19.

While Diane looks on, Anton dusts things off during one of his “Witches’Workshops”, 1967.30. Evidently the witches decided that they shouldn’t have to be the only onesin the buff for thephotographer!31. A rare photograph of the actual John M. Kincaid, whose name was used after1970 as a generalcover-signature for communiqués in the name of the Church of Satan. Kincaid isshown here withAnton in the Purple Room, 1973. Behind Anton's head can be seen an “infinitymirror” (withendlessly-reflecting double mirrors and a self-contained red neon light).32. 6114 (now “6118”) California Street in 2008, after demolition of the “BlackHouse”. The newbuilding is a three-unit condominium, of which the most interesting“coincidences” are on thesecond floor.33. “6118”: This kitchenette is roughly where the Purple Room once was, and toits southwest (behindthe street windows) is the living room where the main ritual chamber used to be.The new livingroom contains a modern artificial fireplace, and to the west of the kitchenetteis a circular metalstaircase descending into a recreation room on the ground floor exactly wherethe Den of Iniquityused to be.34.

First Lieutenant Michael Aquino, South Vietnam, 1969.- 446 -36. Janet Forbes and I first met as toddlers in San Francisco. We were marriedin 1969, with Antonattending our reception [to the horror of the officiating Christian minister].We joined the Church ofSatan later that year, and Janet was ordained to the Priesthood on March 21,1971. After our 1973divorce she remarried a Mormon pro forma within that church. In 1989 shesuccumbed to cancer.Her body was interred in her parents’ cemetery in Wyoming, and her ka now flieseternally free withthe neteru.37.

In the centerof the photo are Priestess Janet Aquino and Priest Michael Aquino.39. For the first meeting upon Nineveh Grotto’s receiving its charter in 1970,Stephen Foster broughtthis cake, whose icing-Baphomet was surrounded with “Happy Birthday Nineveh -Rege Satanas!”.40. The altar of the Nineveh Grotto, Louisville, Kentucky. Atop the altar are mytwo 17th-centuryFrench demon candleholders, Huntley and Brinkley [who were later joined by twogriffins namedHaldeman and Erlichman]. The crystal goblet is from the famous Devil-crownedNepenthe inCalifornia’s Big Sur, while the smaller silver one at right came from theoriginal Green BeretBookstore on Smoke Bomb Hill at the U.S. Army’s Fort Bragg, North Carolina,1968. Resting on thealtar is a silver Italian sword with nude-female hilt, consecrated by AntonLaVey. If the Baphometlooks unusual, it is because I attempted a variation on the Bessy design. Havingno goat to look at, Imodeled the face from Brandy, my Irish Setter, who routinely mingled with ourguests at Grottomeetings and snoozed under the altar during rituals.41. Janet Aquino II° and Michael Aquino III° (wearing the Council of Ninemedallion) at the NinevehGrotto, Louisville, Kentucky, 1971. The mask (from Vietnam) was named “HugoZorilla” after oneof Anton LaVey’s whimsical aliases. The modest Hammon chord organ (not nearly asformidable asAnton’s Yamaha) was situated in our living room but played through remotespeakers into Nineveh’sritual chamber downstairs.42.

As ownerof a pet store, Ethel was able to indulge his desire for a variety of exoticpets, including a cockatoo, atarantula, and a variety of snakes. At the rear is a suit of Roman armor. While6114's Purple Roomsported a tombstone coffee-table, Ethel used a coffin for the same purpose.Within it he kept a fully-stocked bar.54.

The Church of Satan exhibit at the Fisherman’s Wharf Wax Museum, SanFrancisco. This 1973photograph shows the original exhibit. Within a few years the Baphomet medallionaround Anton’sneck had been stolen, the finely-wrought Toledo sword (duplicate of the one in6114’s ritualchamber) had been replaced by a cheap one, the altar-girl’s breast was covered,and the gilt-edgedtapestry of the altar replaced with ordinary black cloth. The only decoration inthe exhibit with anyactual significance is the Baphomet wall-emblem behind the altar.57.
