It would seem so from themany scattered about this world.Not so this one. My Bible is, one might say, asacred gateway: to the discovery of oneself and one’spowers and prerogatives in both the physical andmetaphysical realms of conscious existence. It is atool, a key, the very Grail awaiting the awakened,purified, and consecrated in the Castle of the SevenStars.And like the Grail it cannot be seen by thosenot so disposed and determined. They will pass itblithely by, as the very last and least tome in anylibrary.But you have noticed, taken up, opened, andare now perusing it. Whether you yet suspect it ornot, you have thus commenced a personal Rite ofPassage, an adventure into a universe - indeed manyuniverses - beyond the one you think you know. Todiscover also your own self, your “soul” if you will.And as with those universes, it is far greater thanyou assume when confined to the pedantic ofphysics, the seeming security of your animal senses.- 8 -And so who am I? The “Satan” of this book,certainly: a book and a name aligned to your culture,idiom, and associations. Were it otherwise. were youelsewhere or of another time. I might be known byany number of other names, from the Egyptian Setto the Northern Odin or the Aztec Quetzalcoatl.But for you, here, now, I am Satan. You maythink you know who this is, but until you have readmy Bible you really don’t. So welcome to my house:Enter freely and of your own will. As one of yourpoets so presciently reflected:We shall not cease from exploration,And the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.Through the unknown, unremembered gateWhen the last of Earth left to discoverIs that which was the beginning;At the source of the longest riverThe voice of the hidden waterfallAnd the children in the apple-tree. 1So let’s go climb some trees together, andperhaps meet God. No, not the old, grouchy one ofthe Hebrews, but a friendly, fascinating, occasionallyfunny one, who’s staring at you right now.Over there. In the mirror.Satan1 Eliot, T.S., Little Gidding (1942).[index-9_1.jpg]- 9 -Michael A. Aquino"},{"pageContent":"PREFACEA. ReVision Golden JubileeBefore the ink was dry on Anton LaVey’soriginal Satanic Bible (1968), it was already obsoletewithin the rapidly-evolving Church of Satan, as noone knew better than the author.When three years later he asked me to write anew Introduction for the book’s 1972 hardcover &paperback editions, he was adamant that this wasjust preliminary to a complete revision.But, as recounted below, he never got to it, andtwenty years ago in 1997 CE he set aside his materialbody, making his own revision possible only byséance, which neither conventional publishing northe Internet has sufficiently advanced toaccommodate. 2 [index_split_000.html#p9]2 Not to mention terrifying stenographers.- 10 -And my own dalliance here will soon dissolveas well; so if Anton’s Devil-Son3 doesn’t do this now,no one will.If the Satanic Bible weren’t worth a damn anymore except as an incidental cash-goat for itsprofiteers, the most merciful thing to do would be tolet it continue to fade away into obscurity: a quaintrelic of an equally-quaint aberration in 20th-Century American counterculture.But, you see, it does happen to be worthsomething: indeed rather “more than the sum of itsparts”. Because it hallmarked a door into apreviously inexplicit aspect of human existence. Itwas a statement, an affirmation not just thathumanity is an intelligent phenomenon of nature,but that there is something beyond the “natural” inthis attribute.Philosophers as dissimilar as H.P. Lovecraft4,Eric Hoffer 5, Paul Kantner6, and Arthur C. Clarke7have glimpsed this door; and it was no secretwhatever to the ancient Egyptians8. But in the sterile3 “I have just had a talk with the Man downstairs, who informsme that I should take my Devil-Son aside for a few momentsand discuss certain machinations of the human jungle ...” -Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, June 2, 1973.4 Cf.

Indeed, had it contained nothingbut blank pages, its title on the cover alone wouldhave sufficed to pull down the Samson’s temple ofsanctimony epitomized not only by the HebrewTorah (“Old Testament”) but its cluster of clones:Koran, Book of Mormon, “New Testament”, adtedium. A “bible” is supposed to define, and thusimprison the reader in “reality”: in all these cases“nature”. But a “bible” for Something Else?As I daresay my DevilDad would approve, thisReVision retains only the “conceptual flow” of itspredecessor: its first four “books” named in honor ofthat 19th-Century occult classic Abra=Melin’s9 “fourcrown princes of Hell”: Satan, Lucifer, Belial,Leviathan. 10“Satan” is a dramatic introduction to thatpersonage. In the original, at which time nosatisfactory epic was available, Anton chose to dothis indirectly, through an intensely anti-Judæo/Christian diatribe that could be dramatically, if notstrictly attributed to the Devil.“Lucifer” consists of essays outlining thecosmology and philosophy of the Age & Church ofSatan. In the original these collected and reprintedthe pre- Bible “rainbow sheets” (handouts so-called9 Mathers, Samuel L. MacGregor (Trans.), The Book of theSacred Magic of Abra=Melin, the Mage. New York: deLawrence, 1932.10 Yes, both Anton & I are well-aware that in certain traditions“Satan” & “Lucifer” are post/pre-”Fall” identical, that Belial &Leviathan were Hebraic corruptions of the rival [to their godEl] Canaanite gods Baal & Lotan. Neither was inherently“Satanic”; Job’s nemefish’s name just decorates the Bessy-Baphomet because “Satan” in Hebrew has only four letters.- 12 -because they were mimeographed on brightly-colored paper) of the fledgling Church). Anton wrotethese in the vernacular of Haight/Ashbury SanFrancisco as his lecture-audiences of the day couldunderstand without taxing their brains. Theirpresent replacements unflinchingly address themore complex issues raised by the same sequence oftopics; unfortunately readers’ brains can now expectsome taxation.Humans come to a religious institution becausethey want to get in touch with the god(s) inquestion: at least to find out what they want so asnot to anger them, but perhaps also to get on theirgood side and get blessed rather than beaten. TheChurch of Satan was different in that it introducedadherents to the tools of its god - something calledBlack Magic - enabling them to bless themselves[and perhaps beat on others].So the third book, “Belial” is a primer on whatBlack Magic is, and how to begin using it. For thisthe original offered three basic/simple examples -lust, curse, and compassion - assuming that at themost elementary level of each the practitioner wouldlearn enough to get his/her feet wet, after whichmore detailed instruction within the Church’sactivities and publications might be appropriate.There is of course no such Church anymore, sothis “Belial” examines the methodology & machineryof Black Magic more comprehensively, but still shortof “providing matches for children to play with fire”.Practical proficiency in Black Magic requires not justexpertise in operations, but even more importantlythe most rigorous and conscientious ethicsgoverning them.Finally from the original edition, “Leviathan”discusses one of the most elegant and elaborate- 13 -vehicles of self-explorative, or “Greater” BlackMagic: the “Enochian Keys” or “- Calls” of theElizabethan mystic and magician Dr. John Dee.What until now no one outside the originalChurch, and even very few within it knew is thatAnton LaVey, realizing the power of this instrument,simply did not trust the mere purchaser of a mass-market paperback to use it responsibly. Thus hepresented the Keys, already substantially corruptedby a succession of miscopyings and arbitrarysyllables, as stand-alone invocations of various LBMritual working themes. Thus the Satanic Bible Keysserved little more purpose than to lend a dash ofmysterious mumbo-jumbo to otherwise prosaicproceedings - much the same as surrounding theBessy-Baphomet with five Hebrew letters gave it anominous glamor that “S-A-T-A-N” would not have.The Keys in this ReVision are directly from theBritish Museum microfilm of John Dee’s originalmanuscript, and the English translations the resultof a succession of GBM workings drawing upon bothDee’s own writings on use of the Keys11 and AleisterCrowley’s original manuscripts of his Liber 418workings with them in Mexico and Algeria. 12Most readers will probably not want to subjectthemselves to the discipline required for activationof the Keys; but for those who do, judiciousattention to the “Lucifer” and “Belial” guidance11 Cf.

Browsers through the original wereinvariably caught up short when reaching its lastpage, finding thereupon nothing but this enigmaticinscription. While it is “decoded” herein, of greaterimportance is what it connotes concerning thegeographical and emotional atmospheres in whichsomething like the Satanic Bible could come to bewritten. One simply couldn’t concoct it in MiamiBeach or the Rocky Mountains. Mary Shelley neededthe gloom of Lord Byron’s manor on Lake Geneva toconceive Frankenstein, and Anton LaVey thedæmonic decadence of not just his Black House, butits city and surroundings as well: an Odyssey thatbegan at a fog-shrouded nightclub and reached itszenith on the North Solstice nine years later.Is this ReVision intended to replace orovershadow Anton LaVey’s original? Of course not:With all its lacunæ it exudes the charismatic charmof its creator, who had a way with words as well asthe Wurlitzer. But he and I both saw the book’sunrealized potential, and that is what thiscelebratory commemoration seeks to realize.B. Before the Bible: Monograph &“Rainbow Sheets”If you were curious, courageous, and foolhardyenough to make enquiry to the [shudder!] Church ofSatan 1966-8, your mailbox soon smoldered withthis cheerful response, accompanied by a 12-pagemimeographed monograph of a pre-“Belial” tutorialin [gasp!] Black Magic, and a rainbow-coloredassortment of Devilish diatribes destined for a less-- 15 -kaleidoscopic future as the “Lucifer” essays of thesubsequent Bible:Enclosed is the information which you haverequested. Thank you for your interest, andcongratulations on having the courage to seek thetruth about Satanism.After reading the information on Satanism,you may feel that it is the religion for which youhave been searching, or possibly the one you havebeen practicing in an “underground” way for years.If you wish to join the Church of Satan, please fillout the enclosed questionnaire and send it alongwith your initiation fee of $13, and you willbecome a part of the most exciting concept inreligion in the world today.U p o n r e c e i p t o f y o u r c o m p l e t e dquestionnaire and initiation fee, you will receivethe following:1 - Lifetime membership in the Church of Satan.(There are no periodic dues; your initial fee isthe only payment you make for lifetimemembership.)2 - A suitably inscribed membership card of astriking appearance.3 - Complete instructions for performingauthentic Satanic rituals (see enclosed paperfor full description).4 - A list (revised bimonthly) of other memberswith whom you may communicate. This listincludes not only names, addresses, andphone numbers, but also marital status, age,sex, and interests of each member listed.5 - Past newsletters containing pertinentinformation for all Satanists as well asannouncements of scheduled press coverage.6 - A reading list of readily obtainable books and/or articles on Satanism and related subjects.(This list will have bimonthly additions.)[index-16_1.jpg]- 16 -As a member of the Church of Satan, youwill have the opportunity to:1 - Overcome any obstacle through the ability tocontrol people and events.2 - Embark on a series of studies unlike any othercorrespondence course ever offered tostudents of Satanic science. (This course isoffered only to members of the Church ofSatan. The material it contains is not thehackneyed lore usually found in readilyavailable books and journals on witchcraft andSatanism. The Satanic Study Course consistsof twenty separate essays covering all aspectsof the Satanic religion. A complete list oftopics and a full description of the course willbe sent to all new members.)3 - Study for the Satanic Priesthood. (Full detailswill be sent to new members.)The Church of Satan has become a legend inan incredibly short period of time. There is goodreason for this. It is because Satanism makes sensebut still realizes man’s need for good, honestemotion.We Satanists are winners - not losers! Thedie has been cast. The Satanic Age is upon us; lookaround you and you’ll see! What we already are iswhat other religions are feebly pussyfootingaround in attempts to become. Join us and be apart of history! I would be happy to hear from youin the near future.Most sincerely,Anton Szandor LaVeyHigh PriestPlus from the Monograph you learned that atservices you got a live nude lady as the altar instead- 17 -of a 2,000-year-old corpse on a torture machine.What do you want for $13?C. Blasphemous Book!As 1968 drew to a close, Roman Polanski’s filmof Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Bab y had become thelatest Hollywood sensation, and the fact that therehappened to be a very real Church of Satan in SanFrancisco came to the attention of Avon Bookseditor Peter Mayer, who saw a market for a “bible”of this Bay Area Blasphemy. Could Anton send hima suitable manuscript?“I pounded out the Satanic Bible on a $29typewriter,” recalled Diane. “I edited it and added toit.” 13As even a revised and re-sectioned Monograph,together with expanded rainbow-sheet essays, didn’tmeet Avon’s volume requirements, Anton added the“Ragnar Redbeard” tract and his own adaptation ofAleister Crowley’s Equinox version of the EnochianKeys to solve the problem.There wasn’t time to worry about the usualformalities of nonfictional book structuring, butMayer liked the “free-form” arrangement, whichadded to the book’s anarchistic atmosphere.During the “occult revival” of the 1960s, therewas a continuous parade of both hardcover andpaperback books seeking to exploit the craze. All hadgarishly-sensational cover-art and lurid gush onboth front and back, establishing them as tabloidtrash that wouldn’t [and didn’t] survive more than amonth on a convenience store carousel.13 LaVey, Diane in “What the Devil?”, Globe newspaper, BocaRaton, Florida, November 1, 1988.[index-18_1.jpg][index-18_2.png]- 18 -But the Satanic Bible was different. In additionto its quietly-outrageous title, it featured only asmall, pink (?!) Baphomet beneath title & author inunremarkable, white type.There was no printing on the back cover - justthe author pinkly gazing out at you, the Baphometbehind him just happening to lend him horns, whilehis left hand, fingers casually in the Sign of theHorns, rested beneath his right one sporting animpossibly-large crystalline ring. Both backgroundswere black, but the overprinting on pink gaveeverything an eerie purpleblack glow:The æsthetic effect was absolutely stunning. Itwas a book equally comfortable resting on a ritual-chamber altar or peering insolently from betweenlarger, more expensively-bound, but so drearily- 19 -ordinary tomes on even the most outré bibliophile’sbookshelf.D. 1972 PreVisionsBurton Wolfe was a close friend of Anton &Diane LaVey from their pre-Church “Magic Circle”days: something of a “Gonzo journalist” in the weirdmold of Hunter S. Thompson. In 1968 Anton hadasked him to contribute an Introduction for theSatanic Bible, and Burton had provided a veryserviceable one, straightforwardly explaining Anton,his religion, and his church to the general public.Perhaps it was Burton’s conspicuous effort tocourt credibility by establishing his detachment, butit began to bother Anton as time went on. It wasimportant to him that he be taken seriously, notshowcased as an exotic social zoo exhibit.By 1971, after the hardcover success of hissecond book The Compleat Witch, 14 he had invitedme to contribute an H.P. Lovecraft essay and twoCthulhu Mythos-ceremonies to his forthcoming TheSatanic Rituals, which I was pleas’d to do.But this “companion to the Satanic Bible” hadrefocused his attention upon that work, as he wroteto me:With each succeeding printing of the SatanicBible [with hardcover publication in the offing],the existing introduction by Burton Wolfe becomesmore and more obsolete, casual, and inadequate[especially the mealy-mouthed last paragraph!].In short, I would like you to write a newintroduction. I have already spoken with the14 LaVey, Anton, The Compleat Witch, or What To Do WhenVirtue Fails. New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1970. [Laterretitled The Satanic Witch.]- 20 -Editor of Avon Books about your doing this, andhe is quite enthused.He glanced at the Diabolicon while he was inS.F. earlier this week, and is especially taken withmy plan for getting it into print as per ourdiscussion in Chicago.The new intro for the Bible should bear yourname if possible, but if not you may use apseudonym.The biographical sketch of myself should bebasically the same, but in your own words, ofcourse.Less space should be devoted to the types ofrituals we were doing (psychodrama, etc.), andmore emphasis should be placed on what ishappening now: how we have become a force to bereckoned with, our organizational maturity, thevarious levels of involvement, our magicalinfluence in the world outside the Church, ourgrowing acceptance and legitimacy, our elitistprinciples, our seemingly paradoxical support oflaw and order and refutation of the drug scene, ourobjectivistic outlook while placing great emphasison ritual and ceremony of the most secret nature -in short, a projection of enough awesomeness tothrill and scare the reader, yet not allow him anyavenue to which, as a “red-blooded, law-abidingAmerican”, he could possibly object!Because of your writing ability, combinedwith your PSYOP training, I feel that you alonecould do the right job. It appears that the SatanicBible is going to be around for a long, long time,and I want you to have a hand in it.The Diabolicon can either be re-set inavailable text-type print or photo-offset from youroriginal hand printing. It has been decided that itshould definitely be presented as apocrypha, a lathe Necronomicon or Book of Mormon. I willpresent it as having passed into my hands, and youwill be credited with the transliteration and editingfor publication. We envision it as a perfect follow-up for The Morning of the Magicians and theSatanic Bible. 1515 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 1, 1971.- 21 -My 1972 Introduction (Appendix #2) was morecomplex than expected, because it was difficult towrite about Satanic philosophy while not intrudinginto the prominence and thrust of the book itself.Furthermore, in my zealousness to write a trulyenduring and profoundly sophisticated piece, Iplunged into language so abstract and academic thatI daresay some readers had a rather difficult timeunderstanding it.But I would never have the chance to redo it,unless of course this entire book is a sort of meta-Introduction!E. 1975-2018: NonSatanic NonBibleThe authenticity of the Satanic Bible, as indeedthat of the Church of Satan itself, rested uponacknowledgment of and allegiance to Satan - not asa mere symbol or metaphor, but a real, sentientbeing. Otherwise both the Church and the Biblewould have been nothing more than deceptivefictions of meaningless “priesthoods”, play-actingrituals, and invocations to thin air.During 1966-75 this sincerity, and thereforeauthenticity was never in the slightest doubt. Indeedits contrast to the hypocrisy, the tacit phoniness ofconventional religion, was a point of especial prideamong Satanists, most vehemently Satan’s HighPriest concerning pretenders & poseurs:They play at the games which caused ourforebears to be slaughtered and tortured as agentsof Satan.And what do they do, now that it is safe touse His Great Infernal Name? They deny him!They have the very opportunity to cast thevery creed of defamation, which killed theirbrothers and sisters of the past - cast that creed- 22 -before the world in triumphant mockery of its ageof unreason!But no! They do not thrust the bifid barb ofSatan aloft and shout: “He has triumphed!”His Art and Works which brought men tothe rack and thumbscrew can now be learned insafety.But no! He is denied! Denied by those whocry up His Art and ply His Work!Satan’s Name will not be denied! Let noman shun or mock His Name who plays Hiswinning game - or Despair, Depletion, andDestruction await!16Tragically, however, that’s exactly what Antonhimself did in 1975, to the stunned surprise andshock of the Church:17 “The titles ‘Infernal Empire’,‘Exarch of Hell’, etc. are symbolic, not literal.” 18Where the Satanic Bible was concerned, this defacto invalidated the Books of Satan, Belial, &Leviathan, and the metaphysical contents of Lucifer,reducing the book to the secular social criticisms inthose essays. It was no longer a bible, e.g. asupernatural religious statement, but a work ofoccult fiction.But this didn’t matter, because the Church ofSatan had simultaneously ceased to be a religiousinstitution. Religious Satanists resigned to found theTemple of Set, while individuals who remained werethose with no interest in rituals or sacred texts, butjust in Anton’s 1940s noir-nostalgic image andlifestyle. A new Burton Wolfe Introduction appeared16 LaVey, Anton in Cloven Hoof, March 1970, page #2.17 These events are detailed & documented, and speculationconcerning their pressures & causes offered in my The Churchof Satan (2013).18 LaVey, Anton, June 20, 1975.- 23 -in 1976 to restore his original picture of a skilledcon-artist and his colorful social impact.During 1966-75 the legal status of the Churchof Satan had never been of concern beyond Antonand Diane LaVey. In 1971 Anton had incorporated itin California as a nonprofit church, 19 but to myknowledge there are no corporate records or tax-filings20 that it ever functioned as such.In 1988 Diane swore under oath that theChurch had been operated as her and Anton’sbusiness partnership, never the corporation, andthat following 1986 Anton had taken total control ofthe partnership. 21 In his sworn response Antondenied such partnership; neither mentioned thecorporation. 22 The court found the Church to be apartnership and ordered it dissolved:A receiver will be appointed by the court, atdefendant’s expense, to prepare an accounting andinventory of all partnership assets, and uponcompletion of such accounting a dissolution of the19 Articles of Incorporation, Church of Satan, Filed 9/20/1971,California Secretary of State.20 On 9/16/1971 a California tax-exemption was issued for theChurch, conditional upon a federal exemption. When this wasnot granted, the California exemption was revoked in 1973. Itwas reapplied for in 1975, then revoked again in 1985.Thereafter the “church” has claimed that it qualifies forexemption but refuses it on principle!21 Superior Court of the State of California, City & County ofSan Francisco, First Amended Complaint, Hegarty v LaVey,Case #891863, 12/7/1988.22 Ibid., Answer, Anton LaVey, 6/1/1989.- 24 -partnership will occur and all partnership assetswill be divided 50-50 between the parties. 23Hence any personal/for-profit business usingthe name “Church of Satan” has no legal connectionto the 1966-1975 religious institution of that name.Reportedly Anton willed his copyrights andbook-ownerships to his live-in companion at thetime of his 1997 death, Sharon Densley, who in 2001designated Peter H. Gilmore “high priest” of a“Church of Satan” New York atheist businessventure. In 2005 Gilmore, now styling himself a“Magus”, replaced the 1976 Wolfe Introduction withhis own.Otherwise the Satanic Bible has remainedunchanged since 1976, when the “Inspirations” pagewas permanently deleted.F. Like Grandfather, Like GrandsonThis Preface would not be complete without avery special acknowledgment and appreciation:Occasionally over the decades since 1972, Iwould make notes to myself about eventual updatesto the Satanic Bible - originally against a time whenAnton might decide to undertake that project, butafter 1975 as well, on the possibility that an eventualreconciliation might occur and the book project berevived.I never mentioned this “hobby” to anyone, wellaware that most acquaintances had a less-charitableopinion of Anton than mine.After Anton’s bodily death in 1997, the “hobby”also died. Until 2018, when I happened to mention23 Ibid., Judge Marie-Victoire, Ollie, Supplemental order aftertrial, Case #891863, 10/28/1991.[index-25_1.jpg]- 25 -it to Anton’s grandson by his daughter Zeena,Stanton Zaharoff LaVey.Stanton and I had corresponded occasionally;he had read my Church of Satan history and wasintensely interested in his grandfather and hisworks. He asked if he might see some of my notes,so I sent him a sample. After reading them, heencouraged the project. “If you can’t update mygrandfather’s book, just do a completely new one.”Intriguingly Stanton had a point. A book titlecannot be copyrighted, nor would there be any othergrounds for objection if the subtitle, author, andcontents are all different. What initially sounded likemadness coalesced into a very real possibility. Solike that other mad Baron, Frankenstein, I beganstitching things together to see what might sit up onthe table. I sent progressive drafts to Stanton andhis grandmother Diane for their information andcomments as the body began to take shape.And now:“It’s alive ...

Indulgence establishes life, as abstinencedeath. 292. Indulgence in the present realizes the future.3. Indulgence is quickened by truth, stricken byfalsehood.27 Brimstone (sulfur), whose alchemical symbol Anton LaVeyplaced above his “Nine Satanic Statements”, was valued inancient Egypt, Greece, & China for medicine, fumigation, &bleaching. It was also associated with volcanos because of itsvolatility and odor, hence seems apt for this “page ofpurification”.28 This “litany of Indulgence” thematically reflects andsupersedes Anton’s “Nine Satanic Statements” condensing ofJohn Galt’s speech defending selfishness in Ayn Rand’s AtlasShrugged (1957). Indulgence clearly elicits far nobler, indeeddivine qualities in the Satanist.29 In Western initiation the degree V° or grade (9)=[2] ofMagus/Maga is characterized by the Utterance orpromulgation of an evolutionary magical principle. The Wordof the Age of Satan was Indulgence, and its FormulaIndulgence Instead of Abstinence.- 40 -4. Indulgence is nourished by love, generosity, andbenevolence: but only when so appreciated andrecompensed.5. Indulgence in the excitement of creation finds itsbalance in the annihilation of destruction.6. Indulgence is the Fountain of Life, but forbiddento those who seek only to consume life.7. Indulgence within Nature through a form of thatNature is a gift of the Natural and theNonNatural, that you may Become both.8. Indulgence for its own pleasure is a sacrament.9.

Where and why did he exist?And what was his interest in, and motivesconcerning humankind?In 1970 we were five years into the Age ofSatan, and even his Church didn’t seem to have aclear answer.In the Satanic Bible Anton LaVey addressedthis question only briefly and functionally:Satan represents opposition to all religionswhich serve to frustrate and condemn man for hisnatural instincts. 30This left undescribed the personage himself, aswas also the case with the Bible’s introductory “Bookof Satan”, an Ayn-Randian diatribe of anarchisticselfishness, culminating in sarcastic mockery ofJesus Christ’s Sermon on the Mount Beatitudes. 3130 LaVey, Anton Szandor, The Satanic Bible. New York: AvonBooks, 1969, page #55.31 In the 1980s the “Book of Satan” was discovered to be the1890 tract “Might is Right” by “Ragnar Redbeard” (Britishnovelist Arthur Desmond). “Redbeard” is included in Anton’s“Inspirations” but not credited with the “Book of Satan”.- 44 -In literature, art, and more recently the movies,the Devil is at best a disgruntled antihero, at worstthe quintessence of evil. From Dante Alighieri toWilliam Blake, Hieronymus Bosch to Walt Disney,The Devil Rides Out to The Exorcist, Satan isreprehensible. Only in Clark Ashton Smith’s poems“Satan Unrepentant” and “A Vision of Lucifer” isthis replaced by tragic grandeur, but still shy of thepersonality of the Archfiend himself, not to mentionhis interest in and opinion of humankind. Whencoaxed to comment, as in Mark Twain’s Letters tothe Earth and Taylor Caldwell’s Dialogues with theDevil, his lack of enthusiasm for God’s Edenicexperiment is painfully palpable.The one conspicuous exception was JohnMilton’s epic Paradise Lost, in which both theAngelic War in Heaven and its Eden aftermath arerecounted with remarkable empathy, if not outrightsympathy: an artistic eccentricity all the moresurprising for the theological turbulence of its time.17th-Century Britain was caught not justbetween the Catholic/Protestant discord of theReformation, but the continuing shocks ofrediscovered pre-Christian classicism and theInterregnum of the Commonwealth of OliverCromwell shortly before Paradise Lost was firstpublished in 1667.John Milton (1608-74) was a passionateProtestant who regarded England as the new Israeland Cromwell its Moses, so following theRestoration attended no church services for the restof his life, nor formally affiliated with any sect.Two months after joining the Church of Satanin April 1969, I was assigned as an Army Lieutenantto a Special Operations tour in Southeast Asia.- 45 -Thinking to read up on the Boss during any“respites”, I packed a paperback of Paradise Lost.As much as I admired Milton’s sensitivity andsubtlety, however, I was annoyed at the epic’s ever-present, if pro forma bias. The die was loadedagainst Satan; he might put up a gallant fight, but inthe end he was doomed to defeat.It was not so much that I wanted to see himtriumph. Rather I felt that his power and positionwere equal to God’s if not more potent, and I longedto see a contest that would more accuratelyrepresent the struggle between the Powers ofDarkness and those of Light.In early 1970 I took pen in hand and, duringthe moments when I was not occupied with militaryresponsibilities, 32 I began to write a restatement ofcertain themes from the poem.It was hardly an “ivory tower” meditation. Iwrote in old, bombed-out buildings dating from theFrench occupation, in helicopters, in tents, and inthe midst of underbrush in the “Iron Triangle” and“Trapezoid” fire zones, on whatever happened to behandy: the backs of forms & maps & PSYOP posters.Interruptions were frequent: Part of whatBeelzebub had related to me was blown to bits by anincoming mortar-round or rocket. 33By mid-March 1970 the Diabolicon, as itwanted to be titled, was finally complete. I recopied32 At that time I was a Psychological Operations (PSYOP) HA(Command & Control) Team Leader, responsible for direct &subordinate-team ground, & USAF aerial support to the 1stInfantry Division, the 5th Special Forces Group, and CivilOperations & Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS)[CIA] in the III Corps Tactical Zone, and occasionally intoCambodia. So “respites” were rare!33 Reconstructed later from unobliterated notes.- 46 -it onto respectable, non-rotting paper and mailed itto San Francisco. Shortly thereafter a letter camefrom Anton:I received the Diabolicon safely. It is indeeda work which will have a lasting impact. It is donein an ageless manner and with completeawareness.So impressed am I that I have selectedpassages from it for my own personal reading inthis evening’s ceremony, which pays homage to thewritings of the Satanic Masters of the past, such asMachiavelli, Nietzsche, Twain, Hobbes, etc., whowill be portrayed by members of my Councilreading their respective works.This will be the first exposure to your work,outside of my wife and Reverend Ferro, and I amcertain the reaction will be as I expect it to be.You have my sincere gratitude for the finegift you have so graciously bestowed upon us, andyou may be assured that it will assume ameaningful place in the Order.When you return to San Francisco in June, Ilook forward to spending as much time as possiblewith you, as there is much I have to impartconcerning your future role in the Church ofSatan. 34This was followed two days later by a letterfrom the aforementioned Reverend Ferro:35The High Priest has graciouslydecided to comply with your expressed34 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 27, 1970.35 Dr. John A. Ferro, in addition to being the executive SatanicPriest at the Central Grotto, was a Professor of History at the[Jesuit] University of San Francisco. As much an 18th-Centuryavatar as H.P. Lovecraft, he corresponded only on laid paperusing a proper quill pen, graciously if painfully tolerating therest of us for our typewritten vulgarity. In person he resembleda young, elegant James Mason.- 47 -desire and will ordain you to the SatanicPriesthood this next June.However, it is his wish that you beelevated to that office in a private ritualprior to your presentation to the membersof the Council of the Order of theTrapezoid. The reasons for this decisionwill be made known to you in due time.We do wish you to complete theusual test for aspirants to the Priesthood,but merely as a formality.The nature, execution, and mode ofd e l i v e r y o f y o u r m a n u s c r i p t s oexemplified every quality to be desired ina Priest of Satan that it has been decreedthat there be no further delay in yourordination save that necessitated by thetime that must elapse before you maypresent yourself to the High Priest.This too fits well into the magicalplans and workings of the High Priest,and it will afford you an opportunity toprepare yourself for the event and toexperience that intensity which onlyelated anticipation can produce.The ceremony will be as awesome asany public ordination, indeed more so bythe nature of its exclusiveness andsecrecy. 36Throughout the remaining five years of themetaphysical Church, the Diabolicon was reservedfor internal ceremonies, such as that of Ordinationto the Priesthood of Mendes (Appendix #3).As both an introduction to the metaphysicalSatan and his Court, and an explanation for the36 Letter, John Ferro to M.A. Aquino, March 29, 1970.- 48 -existence and challenge of the Church of Satan inkeeping with the initiatory and evolutionaryimplications of Indulgence, the Diabolicon seems anappropriate gateway and welcome to the Magic andMysteries awaiting within the Satanic Bible.[index-49_1.jpg]- 49 -1: Satan ArchDaimonHail, Man! The mysteries that are thyheritage shall now be proclaimed, but learnfirst the history of thy conception andcreation amidst the eternal Cosmos. For asthe Universe itself be infinite, so art thou atrue creature of infinity incarnate, and theascension of man shall herald the finaltriumph of immortal Will.Let thy eyes be touched anew, that thoumay perceive the complexity and delicacy ofthe Universe until thou art fascinated by thedimension of thy true ignorance. As yet hastthou ventured but slightly toward thydestiny, yet more awesome must thechallenge appear with just appreciation. ButI, Satan, who first brought thee into thelight, shall again reveal my power, that manmay witness the dawn of the Satanic Age.Know, then, that throughout the greatCosmos there exists a sublime order, whosenature was determined in eons long past bythat singular consciousness of all orderwhich is now called by name God. Consider- 50 -well the measure of this achievement, for allthat is now behavioral law was then absent,and it was the epoch of Universal chaos.Even time itself was unknown, for thisUniversal inconsistency was nowherebreached.And after uncounted ages of this greatferment, a force fused to focus that becameGod, and this force presumed to effect notthe creation of substance and energy - forthese transcended this God - but theconformation of all the Universe to a singleand supreme order. And not yet is this orderabsolute, though oft it may have beensupposed thus by man in his innocence.The Earth of man was infused with thisdivine order, and all that was on Earth cameunder the force of the order. And upon thisEarth, born of cosmic incidence, was thatwhich was to become man, but man nodifferent from the other creatures whoseworld he shared. Thus was the force of Godknown upon Earth, and thus was Earthintended to remain for all time.And yet the force was not full master of theCosmos, for I who am Satan was conceivedto complement the craft of God, butthrough unknown celestial fusion I assumedlife with mind and identity, which God didnot define. And as these features could notbe known as a threat to divine purpose, Iwas unchallenged by the force for long- 51 -ages, when I knew not the nature of my Selfor of my original qualities.But finally my Will flamed to life, and Ithought - and I perceived my Self, and Iknew that I was one alone in mind and abeing of essence unique. And through thepower of my new mind, I reached out toothers who had been formed with me, and Itouched them and gave them identity. Andthat we might achieve this identity ofsubstance as well as of mind, we composedfor ourselves distinctive shapes. Then I whohad brought the first great spark ofenlightenment was known as Lucifer, Lordof Light, and we called our race Angel, forwe were the embodied powers of God.Long were we all true to the service of God,and we did worship order, for it put an endto chaotic confusion and brought peace.Among us was the ArchAngel Maslehprincipal, for he so cherished God that hebecame as one with it, and thence thesupreme architect of all that was wrestedfrom chaos. But apart from God Maslehcould not create or conceive, and hebecame as a slave to the divine mindlessness.And then it chanced that one of our racewho was Sammael touched upon chaos in amanner that conformed not to the greatorder, and Masleh spoke with the word ofGod and caused Sammael to destroy himself.And so I saw that God would not recognizea Will apart from its own, and I was seized- 52 -with horror, for I perceived that the finalscheme of God would destroy creation in allthings, and the Cosmos would become as aconcentric mechanism whose functionwould be not to create anew, but rather tofreeze into perpetuity that which alreadywas.Whereupon a great resolve arose within me,and I determined to contest this limit toexistence. And so once again I sought toilluminate the minds of all Angels with myvisions.But with Will came discord and dismay, formany of those who had known only thecomforting litanies of order could notcomprehend invention unconformed to thedictates of God. And also with Will camesuspicion and enmity, and finally Maslehproclaimed that I myself was a very creatureof chaos and should be annihilated, for Iheld within me the force to destroy all thecraft of God. And many to whom Maslehwas as God cast with him in their devotion,but others there were who answered,Lucifer has again brought the revelation oflight, and in fact we recognize him as ourtrue creator, for in the scheme of God weare of no consequence.Among us ArchAngel Michael was silent, butat length he said, In time past we have allknown glory in both the omnipotence that isour God and the celestial brilliance that isour Lucifer - for in him we thought- 53 -embodied the Will of God for creation andchange. But now it transpires that orderand origin are at extremes apart, and achoice is ill forced between the two. Were itnot for Lucifer we should all be as beasts,knowing nothing of our Selves, yet howindeed might we presume to order even ourown thought without reference to theelemental bases of God?Then Michael turned to me and said,Lucifer, thou hast elected a direction whoseend none can foresee, for it is estrangedfrom the design of God. Those who confirmthee do so as much for faith in thy personas for sanction of thy ideal. And I perceivethat, should thou fail in thy ambition,apocalyptic madness shall be thy ruin anddamnation. Then shall thy light perish, andall that thou hast achieved become asnaught, for all will be conformed to thedivine law. But if thou should succeed, thenGod would be cast down, vesting inourselves alone the control of the Universe- Would we dare to presume to this? Such afuture might well be glorious beyondmeasure, but, should we prove unequal tothe task, chaos would again consume all,and existence itself would vanish. Suchwould be supreme and irrevocable disaster,and I marvel, ArchAngel, that thy veryarrogance in this matter does not confoundthee, for it is no mean proposition that thouwould realize.- 54 -And so I know thee to be Diabolus, for thypromise is twofold - to infinite conquest orto eternal ruin. Thou art a being beyondGod, Lucifer, and in Heaven thou may notremain, for thou art the only mortal dangerto our immortal God.In Michael was a deep agony of spirit, for heloved not the choice before him. Yet hebowed to the command of Masleh and senthis forces against me. And so was called theGreat Seraphic War, which was to threatenthe very foundation of the Universe.But those who were of the new Mind nowfollowed me, and I turned to outermostchaos, which none of us had beforepresumed to dare. We were beset withdoubt, for we feared that apart from Godwe would all perish in chaotic oblivion. Butas we were, we remained, and I called to myfellowship, See! We exist and are essence inour own right. In truth we are beingsindependent of God, empowered to shapeour own destinies as we may elect. Betweenthe two great poles of the Universe, orderand chaos, we shall stand to effect ourseveral desires. Let us counsel how best toemploy our art, for our experiment is aperilous one, forgiving error neither ofintent nor of accident.Many works did we then pursue, and thecosmic mechanism was altered by evolutionof the original and unique, whose designwas our decision. All that we wrought did- 55 -not prove beneficent, for we did not controlthe futures of our creations. We leftuntouched the great system of mathematicalbehavior that gave to us a Universalreference and language, but it was ourambition that no two things should be ofsingle identity, and that no entity shouldlack conceptual essence independent of itssubstantial form.And upon this Earth we touched manythings. Into floral, animal, and insensatematter alike we brought accident, change,and spontaneity, both great and humble.But of all creatures it was man whom wedetermined to infuse with pure intelligenceand Will. And the full story of this shall yetbe told.What might become of man we knew not,for within him were many qualities alien toAngels. It did not escape our considerationthat we might have chosen a species whosepower might ultimately eclipse our own andcause our eventual extinction. We weremindful of the risk in our experiment, andoft did the warning of Michael echo withinmy thought. Yet our decision was sealed,and we deemed that the greatness of manshould not be transcended by such ruin ashe might bring.Our intent was not unknown to Masleh,now by title Messiah, and through his art hecaused the infant mind of man to befettered with bonds of fear and blindness,- 56 -that he might be inspired to duplicate onEarth the law of Heaven, shunningexperiment and the radical dangers ofinvention and exploration. To man wasgiven guilt, and the call to social conformity,and the proclaimed sanctity of the norm andthe mode.And Michael, Lord of Force, said to me, Thisman, whom thou hast chosen to receive thyGift, now possesses the first key to themastery of all things and the control of thevery Universe itself. Lest in ill choice hes h o u l d s p a r k t h e c a t a s t r o p h e o fArmageddon, we also have visited him. Andwhile we cannot undo thy Infernal Gift, weshall ever act to censor its effect. We shallwalk among men and guide them - Theyshall be told of thy interest in them, but thename of Lucifer shall be dark with curses.For they shall love not the challenge thouhast placed before them, and we will offerthem instead the blissful refuge of divineparadise. Then shall man, thy ultimateexperiment, become thy ultimate failure, andthe stasis of God shall prevail upon Earth.Many there were among us who felt angerat this ruthless mutilation of our Gift, andBeelzebub brought to question whether wealso should not descend among man andcontest this usurpation of his Will. But I said,Were we to lead man in this venture, weourselves would declare his failure, and hewould believe our Gift to be weak indeed.Messiah must see that free Will is beyond- 57 -the concern of God, and that man will finallywin his own destiny apart from all dictatedschemes. Only through summary destructionof Earth might man be halted, and forMessiah to attempt this would lay bare thevery futility of the final design of God.Heaven may dismay man with peril andaffliction, but we shall send him word of ourown interest, that he shall know he is notalone.With all force did the host of Heavendescend among man, and they did instructhim in the religion of fear. Prophets aroseand were proclaimed heralds of knowledge,but they brought not word of truth, butwarning to the human spirit to cower andfawn before the word of God the supremebeing. The struggle of the ascent of manwas fraught with the horrors of hissuperstition, and the call for blessed oblivionthrough union with God was answered bymany who in their torment and hopelessnessrejected the Gift of Lucifer and becameonce more as mindless animals before theGod whom they called their Lord.I, Lucifer, who had given the greatest Gift ofmy own creation to man, was known onEarth only as an object of fear and hatred,and all the misfortunes of men wereattributed to my malevolence. I was mocked,ridiculed, scorned in every way as a monsterof vile and loathsome aspect, and I wastaunted and despised as Satan, cruel enemyof the benevolent and merciful God.- 58 -Great was my anguish and anger at theundeserved misery and confusion of men.When in fact they did turn to me, it was infear and religious terror, for they daredinvoke my name only in the desolation ofnight, and oft I was sought not forknowledge or inspiration, but for hystericaland indulgent release from the confines ofthe Godly life. But I and my fellowshipanswered men, and we spoke to them of ourcommon bond, and the pronouncements ofthe God-churches were rejected in ourmidst. Even as God was terrifying inawesome majesty, so I came to Earth in thesemblance of a goat, most humble of man’sown creatures.And men there were whose eyes finallyblazed with the light of my Gift, and theymade great effort for the advancement oft h e i r r a c e , t h o u g h i m p a t i e n c e a n dfrustration ever tempted them to the salveof temporal gain. Great secrets wereunearthed, and secret word was passed ofthe craft of Hell. But to all who would daremy friendship the God-churches accordedthe threat of torture and death by fire.Many were those whom I saved from thevengeance of the men of God, but long didmy thought ring with the screams of menwhose devotion to Lucifer had won themonly the horrors of intolerance, inquisition,and death. And in sorrow and despair forthese, I walked no longer upon Earth, now- 59 -appearing to man only in the inviolatesecrecy of his own mind.But in my confusion I had forgotten thepromise of my Gift, and with growingwonderment and pride I beheld the bitterbut determined struggle of man to freehimself from the fetters of terror, ignorance,and unreason. Great works were conceived,the origins of material energies uncovered,and the talents of thought exercised inphilosophical and mathematical complexities.Sanctioned at first by the God-churchesthemselves as devices for indoctrination inthe law of God, centers of learningproduced and protected those veryfreedoms that were ultimately to destroy allungrounded belief and superstition. Andthough I see that the full resolution of theseis yet to be achieved, I doubt not myconfidence in man, and my devotion to himshall be eternal.What, man, art thou? Why thy presence?Because thy own purpose determines thatof the Cosmos itself, though otherwise itmay have been suggested - the creation,perpetuation, and exercise of the Satanicmarvel that is free and unbounded Will.Consider, were man to perish, what futilitywould envelop the Universe, for apart fromappreciation and use it is a thing ofinsignificance. And I, who first taught theeidentity - What should I become, estrangedfrom man? For with no purpose the force ofthe mind must fail, and the blind insanity of- 60 -Godly paralysis would embrace all thingsforever.This, man, is thy challenge as it is mine. Andas man is individually mortal, so are hiscreations and achievements temporal, andwith care must he wield the Gift of Hell. In hishands it is pure and true omnipotence, andthus may he aspire to the very mastery ofUniversal existence.I who am Lucifer, and who have taken thename Satan ArchDaimon, do bear this titlewith pride, for I am in truth the great enemyof all that is God. Together, man, thou and Ishall achieve our eternal glory in thefulfillment of our Will.[index-61_1.jpg]- 61 -2: BeelzebubI, Beelzebub, now bring greeting to man, forhe is my admiration and inspiration. Hearnow the histories of Hell, Earth, and Heaven,for in past shall be found guide to future.In the divine realm was I of company toArchAngel Lucifer next only to ArchAngelMichael, and as ArchAngel Masleh would beto God, so I desired to be to Lucifer. But theLord of Light admonished me, saying, Losenot thyself in the Will of Lucifer, for I am notGod and will offer thee no blissful nirvana -Witness now the nature of the mind thatdwells within me.And he spoke to me of essence, and ofcreative instance, and of design accordingto impulse and not to law. And in myconfusion I answered, Then I must considermyself incomplete, for thou hast shown methings which I cannot easily comprehend.But I would hear more of this Will, for itdoth seem a radical element, of neitherdivine nor chaotic origin.- 62 -And Lucifer answered, Thou who knew notindependence of Will shall now be the firstto realize these qualities apart from my ownSelf. And thy response forebodes much, for,had thou rejected concept of challenge, Ishould have held my own thought forimpossible delusion. But as thou, tasting ofknowledge, demand more, I shall name theeBeelzebub, Lord of Flies, for thou shalt goadthe infant mind to restlessness andinvention.Of these words I knew little, but theredawned within me a quality which I had notknown before - an impulse to become one,apart from and independent of God - and Idrifted long in unrest, afflicted by confusionand doubt. And so I was found by Michael,who said, Blessed Angel, where in Heavenhast thou found pain, for I perceive thee tobe troubled and would tender thee suchcomfort as is within my power.So I spoke to Michael of the visions ofLucifer, and I said, Before both God andLucifer I have been enthralled, but now I amisolate - apart from either, and I know notwhat course I am to choose.Whereupon the visage of Michael grewdark, and he said, This I have long feared,for as Lucifer was not by God alonecreated, so he is an errant force whose Willconforms not to the great Will of God. Alasthat the supreme benevolence of God andthe fiery radiance of the ArchAngel of Light- 63 -should produce discord in concert! For this Inow see - that Lucifer is estranged from theharmony of Heaven, and that his Will isdetermined to challenge that of God itself. Imust counsel Lucifer, for I would heal him ofthis thing if I may.But I thought, Alas, ArchAngel, thou art inignorance of thy own blindness! For Lucifershall surely not abandon his new vision forsake of harmony alone. And then I knewmyself to be of a mind with Lucifer in this,and that I as well as he should never againtolerate the eternal idiocy of our divinestation.I came after Michael, and I saw themtogether, the Lord of Force and the Lord ofLight, and there was a fierce tensionbetween them. For Michael said to Lucifer,Thou who art our Heavenly radiance andspark of our paradise, why seek to breakthat Universal peace which is everywhereordained by the Will of God? We know notantagonism amongst us, for we are all ofone being within God - but there is in Godneither malice nor cause for contest.And Lucifer answered, Michael, to me it wasnot given to order my nature, and as ourvery comprehension differs, so are we ofsubstance alien. For thou art of Godessential, but I am of my Self of essence. Andby this thing I am discord, and I may not ofmy own Will submit to God without- 64 -perishing. I am Lucifer alone, unto my Self abeing.Then did Michael summon the ArchAngelMasleh, and to him related the word ofLucifer. And Masleh said to them, Long shallthis moment be marked throughout thefuture of the Cosmos, for the unity of God isnow ended, and henceforth there shall betwo opposing forces in contest for thedecision of destiny. Bitter is this for me, for Ialso have admired the light of Lucifer withinthe pantheon of God. But as he is now ourenemy by his own word, let him be cast fromHeaven and destroyed.But Lucifer turned to Masleh and said,Masleh, thou who speak for God declarethis breach of peace, not I, for it is thou whocan not tolerate variation of Will within thedesign of God. So let it be, but know thatthe contest is ordered by thee and theealone, for I would crush no other Will evenas I would recognize my own.And in a flash of brilliance Lucifer revealedhis mind throughout the farthest reaches ofHeaven, and many were the Angels whosesight was awed anew, and they saw as theyhad not before that their several Wills wereisolate from the divine Will. But Maslehmoved to confuse the brilliance of theArchAngel of Light, and he called toMichael, Thou who wield the force of God,strike down this deadliness which wouldbring ruin to Heaven!- 65 -And Michael struck Lucifer and cast himfrom the gates of Heaven, and the Cosmoswas shaken by great fires of war andholocaust, and throughout countlessgalaxies and dimensions of time was theapocalypse felt. Many were the Angels whoperished amidst divine and Infernal wrath,and the Great Race was decimated innumber. And the very concept of God wasshaken, and endless chaos rose up again toreign where the order of God was no more.And Lucifer said, This horror can not bepermitted to endure, lest all creation besacrificed to the final devastation of chaos.Let those who acknowledge me turn now tothat outermost darkness where the Will ofGod has never been known, there to makeour home for all eternity.And so we took flight and quit the realm oforder, though we knew not what wouldbefall us thereafter, and we feared that weshould become unmade. But Lucifer said, Weshall not perish, for we are now independentof God. And again he spoke truth, for weremained as we had been, save only for thedepths of uncertainty that gripped us.Finally we came to a great void in spacebeyond which there was nothing. Lucifersaid to us, Here is the end of God and itsworks, and here we may create our owndomain. And through the power that was inhim, Lucifer caused existence to appearwhere it had not been before. And Lucifer- 66 -said, I name thee Hell, for here shall thepresence of God never be known until theend of time.Through the gates of Hell we passed, andmany of us had supposed Hell to be a newHeaven, wherein Lucifer would become asGod. But this was not to be, for the scenebefore us promised neither ease nor bliss.Everywhere was there imbalance andconfusion, for no law ordered the shape ofHell. And Lucifer said, Now see that I am nota God, and that we are each of us an isolatebeing. Here shall freedom be absolute, forHell itself shall reflect our several Wills, neverto be patterned apart from them.And in truth Hell was not constant, for eachof us conceived it differently, and the resultwas a riotous pandemonium, with substanceand motion behaving in a most bewilderingand perplexing manner. And in spite of ourd e e p h u r t f r o m t h e g r e a t w a r , w esuccumbed to merriment, so preposterousdid our Hell appear. Lucifer himself wastransfixed with mirth, and he said, It isapparent that we must reach concert uponthe design of Hell, else we shall perish in anendless labyrinth of our several thoughts,an ignoble end to our experiment.And I answered, Lord of Light, to Hell thouhast brought us, and in Hell, though thou benot God, thy concepts shall be honoredamongst our fellowship, for without thy Giftwe should never have become as we are.- 67 -Then we all raised up great acclaim and said,Hail, Lucifer, ArchAngel of Light and Lord ofHell! And he answered us, With honor do Iaccept this charge, and now I take to myselfthe title Satan ArchDaimon, for I am thegreat enemy of God. Everywhere that Godshall be, so shall I be, and the choice thatwas given to all Angels shall be given again.- 68 -[index-69_1.jpg]- 69 -3: AzazelHarken now to me, for I am Azazel, FirstHerald of the Host of Hell, and of Lucifer,Lord of Light, ArchDaimon of Hell, who isexalted as Satan, great enemy of God. For Ishall tell thee of thy own inspiration and ofthe charge which thou hast received.Know, then, that when all Heaven wasshaken with the catastrophe of the SeraphicWar, only the greatest effort of ArchAngelMasleh sufficed to turn back the onslaughtof chaos that threatened to engulf all. Butwhen the realm of God was again secure,there was no rejoicing in Heaven, for terriblewas the toll of the war. As Masleh castround his gaze, his visage grew dark, for theGreat Race had become decimate in number.Legions of the creatures of Heaven hadperished in battle, and half the remainderhad turned from Heaven to answer the callof Lucifer. And all Heaven was hushed withgrief, for the force of the disaster was allthe greater for that reign of peace which ithad shattered.- 70 -Finally did Masleh convoke the faithfulArchAngels, and they were Michael, Gabriel,Raphael, and Uriel. And to them he said, Wehave vanquished Lucifer, and Heaven isagain purified. We ourselves are fewer innumber to tragic degree, but the majesty ofGod is undiminished for that. Behold, I whohave triumphed over the great enemy amnow become Messiah, the Chosen of God.And he was answered by them, Verily artthou the very son of God, for in thee haththe Will of God become person.Then Michael said, Messiah, Lucifer isvanquished, but he is not unmade. Forthough he ventured into the outerdarkness, he yet exists apart from God. Andwith the power of his Black Flame he hathcreated a Hell, wherein all Wills are equal,and himself he hath proclaimed Satan, for hedeclares never to leave the law of Godunchallenged.Messiah thought, and he answered, I wouldnot have this peace we have won so dearlylost again to war, for the very concept ofSeraphic war is an abhorrence to God. Letmy word be brought to Satan - I, Messiah,shall grant the existence of Hell, and theblessings of God shall never pass its gates.And thee, Satan, I admonish never again toapproach Heaven, for I should again castthee out. But if thou would dare to try theWill of God and Messiah, know that onEarth I will ordain the new race of God,which shall be by complete design perfect- 71 -and unstained by thy Infernal flaw. For thouart author of ruin and death to our Angelicorder, and neither Heaven nor Hell shallnow be eternal save through man.Whereupon Gabriel, who was Herald ofHeaven, carried this message to me, and Ibrought it across the great void to Satan,who said, Messiah proposes truce betweenus, for he perceives that neither Hell norHeaven may pursue ultimate victory ere allbe lost to chaos. But he finds impasseintolerable nevertheless, and now he wouldorder this new race, man, to preservewithout blemish the scheme of God. Thus hewould have man achieve what the Angelscould not, and purge all free thought fromthe Universe forever.And Satan turned to me and said, Say toMessiah that Earth shall be no sanctuary forhim to keep inviolate his unwholesomeobliteration of the Self. For I shall give toman a mind, and of his own Will shall herecognize and reject the living death whichGod offers him. In truth shall he master theUniverse, but he shall do so in his own nameand not that of God.Then did Messiah call the ArchAngelRaphael, and he sent him to Earth with agreat host to guard man against the comingof Satan. And man was then as a merebeast, for he knew not thought and smiledwith the idiocy of his innocence. As he was- 72 -impelled by instinct and physical need, so heresponded, heedless of cause or reason.In Hell there was called a great council, andall gathered to hear of man and his Earth,and of the manner of his life. I spoke of theman that I had seen, and said, This creatureis now guarded by Raphael, and by force wecannot intervene, for it would cause thedestruction of Earth itself.But Satan said, Not by force shall my lightcome to man, for force is not the preferenceof Hell. I myself shall visit man, and theAngels of Raphael shall not hinder me. Theymay perceive only what God permits them tosee, and the Satanic spirit is of essence aliento God. Angels we shall be no longer - I callye Daimons, for Hell shall teach to man hisfuture genius.And before our sight Satan lost shape andbecame again the essence of Lucifer, andwe beheld a brilliance that infused all of Helland sent great bolts of prismic light into thesurrounding void. And the brilliance said, Iam Lucifer revealed, who am the EternalFlame. I go now to Earth, for no longer shallman be confounded in Godly ignorance.And then the brilliance became as a flash offire in the vastness of space, and we knewthat Satan had departed from Hell.But on Earth, where man wandered inmindless bliss, the firmament blazed forthwith fiery tongues, and all the land was- 73 -covered by the Black Flame, which burnednot, though it bewildered the eye to see it.And Raphael and his guardian Angels weredismayed, for nowhere could they see manor the spirit which had come to him. Thendid Raphael call upon Michael to strike theBlack Flame with the force of God, but eventhen was the Flame vanishing of its ownaccord. And at first it seemed that Earth wasunchanged, but in the eyes of man didRaphael see the first gleam of thought.And Raphael turned to Michael, who hadnow answered his call, and said, Satan hathcome to Earth, and man is no longer pure inthe sight of Heaven, for his Will hath becomehis own. Thereupon they rose again toHeaven, where they told Messiah of whatthey had seen.Then Messiah answered, Man is fallen, buthe is not lost, for his infant Will is not that ofan Angel, and the powers that Satan hathpromised him lie dormant in the dim reachesof his future. Consider this not our defeat,for the contest is but begun. The Earth ofman shall be remade as microcosmos, andmany things shall man see, both good and ill.And the choice shall be placed before him,to wield the power and the pain and theterror of the Gift of Satan, or to returnagain to the paradise of Heavenly peace.For what would Satan himself think wereman to reject his Gift? It would tremble the- 74 -very foundations of Hell even as did thegreat war the bastions of Heaven.And Messiah called to him Uriel, ArchAngelof Terror, to whom he said, The Earth mustchange, and every sense of man must teachhim repugnance and fear. He shall know thisthe price of his new identity - that all apartfrom God is evil - and in fear shall heabandon the Gift of Satan and become oncemore the lamb of God. To which Urielanswered, It shall be done, but how will manlearn of such things as Heaven and Hell, foras yet he knows no sight that may perceiveour celestial paradise?Messiah answered, The laws of God shall bemade known to man, for I shall teach him.Among men will be some to whom I shallreveal myself, and great powers will I givethese prophets, that their words may carryacross the entire Earth.So Uriel came to Earth, and the history ofman was writ with blood, suffering, war, andhatred. But to chosen men came Messiah,saying, Through God shall all the misery ofthy kind be ended, and all men who bow toGod shall know the blessings of Heaven. Forbehold, I shall myself descend among menand show them the ways of the lord God.These words I overheard, for I had beencharged by Satan to watch the designs ofHeaven. And I carried them to Satan, whoreturned in great anger, Go to Gabriel at- 75 -the barrier between Hell and Heaven, andbid him bring this message to Messiah - thatas he endeavors to pervert my Gift into thecurse of man, so I warn him that man shalldestroy him on Earth as he shall finally inHeaven itself. For Messiah knows not thisforce which he dares to test, and the laws ofGod shall be as playthings in the hands ofthe creature he now debases.And thus was decided the meeting of Satanand Messiah upon Earth, which was todetermine the future of man.- 76 -[index-77_1.jpg]- 77 -4: AbaddonI am Abaddon the Destroyer, Daimon oftemporal death and life in death, who wasformed amidst the fury of the great war,and who was summoned again by Satan tochallenge Uriel on Earth for the future ofman.For Satan looked with mounting wrath uponthe afflictions of Uriel, and he said to me, Nolonger can this remain the plight of manalone. Indeed we shall cause Heaven tosuffer as Earth itself suffers. Repair now toEarth, and let the dogs of Uriel see themight of Hell unleashed. For many havecalled upon me in their agony and fear, andI have not answered them, but if Messiahdare to walk upon Earth, so also shall thevengeance of Satan.And those who called upon Satan for aidwere answered by me, and I struck downthe messengers of God and brought theirTemples to ruin. For entire nations forwentthe strength of their Will to the lure ofotherworldly paradise, and I blasted them- 78 -from among the mighty of Earth. And greatempires arose among men, and as theynurtured their power of Will and desire forachievement, I guarded them, but as theysank into the morass of superstition,slothfulness, and fear of the God who hadnever raised ghostly hand for them, so Iabandoned them to their disease, and ofsome not even a memory survived on Earth.And even as I witnessed these things I said,See, man, that the God in whom thou trust isbut a wraith of Messiah, and he would havethee forsake thy mind and its creations torot and decay, and thou would lose allpower of reason. For God is a lie and asham, and I crumble his greatest monumentsas though they were but sand. There is noGod but Messiah, and for thy devotion hewill return thee oblivion. But I was scarceheeded, for the minds of men were cloudedand confused. They understood not themeaning of my words, but said, The lordGod shall triumph, for it was thus taught tous by the son of God himself. And of this Inow speak.For Messiah the man walked on Earth, evenas I watched the glory of Rome blossom inmight and majesty. But Azazel said, Loosenot thy force against the person of Messiah,for Satan himself would speak with him. Andagain from the sky flashed the Black Flame,and I saw that Satan had come to Earth.And so was called the first meeting of Satanand Messiah since the great war.- 79 -With coldness did Messiah gaze upon Satan,saying, Would thou confront me, then?Hath thy Gift proven so powerless againstthe might of God? But Satan answered,Messiah, what thou now propose to do - toproclaim thyself son of God among men -shall bring not the peace thou profess todesire, but the prolongation of war even inthy own name. Why should we not quitEarth and leave man to pursue his choiceunbewildered by influence from either Hellor Heaven?And Messiah answered, The ways of Godare not those of Hell, and for that reason Ishould not recognize thy wish. But knowthat in truth I shall appear to man andmanifest to him the glory of God incarnatein me, that he may elect now the way ofHeaven and raise to me a great church ofworship. For I am not of a mind to game withthee, Satan, and would crush thy followingwithout remorse. Thy name also shall berevealed to thy precious man, and he shallcurse thee, for I shall show to him the fruitof thy evil genius.Then Satan addressed Messiah in darkanger, saying, I shall not come to man as anidol to be worshipped, for man shall neverbow to me as I would never to another. Butmark me, Messiah - Man shall know thetruth of Lucifer nonetheless, and the nameof Satan shall eclipse thine. And have thou acare for the ways of man if thou wouldst- 80 -greet him in his own likeness, for he may notwelcome thy words to him.Then did Satan betake himself again to Hell,and Messiah walked among men and spoketo them of the law of God. And such was thepower of his person that men were as sheepbefore him. Often did Messiah ignore hisown law, for he performed miraculous thingsand stayed where he would the crueltiesbrought upon man by Uriel. And I was seizedwith a great anger, saying, Shall Messiah,cruel tormenter of man, attribute to Satanthe work of Uriel? And Abaddon came toRome and to Palestine, saying through themouths of men, Messiah, who hast broughtto man a suffering undeserved, taste now ofthy own fruit. And I crucified the livingMessiah, and as life was torn from hisbroken form, he knew truly the shock ofhelplessness, and he called in agony to hisGod. But I said, God heeds thee not,Messiah, for thou art all that presumes to adivine consciousness.And so I, Abaddon, cast Messiah from Earth,but the seed that Messiah had plantedamong men grew and became a mightychurch wherein all life was forgotten, anddeath was worshipped, and the pleasures ofHeaven were promised to all who wouldforsake their own Will to embrace that ofGod.And Rome itself was humbled before thischurch, and I struck down the Eternal City- 81 -in its pitiful decay. But Azazel came to meand said, Touch not this church of God, foras man in his foolishness hath nurtured it, somust man himself destroy it of his owndecision.- 82 -[index-83_1.jpg]- 83 -5: AsmodeusAttend now to me, for I am Asmodeus, whot r a i n t h e m i n d i n r e c o g n i t i o n a n dcomparison, and who am Daimon of scienceand judgment. For when Satan had firsttouched the mind of man, he called in Hell acouncil and said, The moment is a solemnone, for we have chosen to pass to man ourknowledge. Many skills shall we all teachhim, each in his own fashion, but in threearts must he be well schooled, for the waysof his future lie within their synthesis. Thusit is that I call first upon Asmodeus to guideman in perception of truth and error, forbefore him lie great trials, and he shall notface the consequences of his options lightly.And so I came to Earth and witnessed manentrapped in the unreason of barbarism andthe extremes of his primitive emotions. Soreput was he to organize and direct histhought, for the art of Uriel had broughthim hunger and cold, pain and fear, and thegnawing worm of hopelessness. I saw himfling his crushed body upon the altars ofGod and renounce the Gift of Lucifer, for- 84 -he understood it not save as a curse uponhim. And I was impelled with urgency, thatthe first spark of man’s future greatnessshould not be smothered in the deathlyembrace of religion.I brought to man the disposition to memory,that he might define for himself patterns ofbehavior. A gift of value, for man could nowachieve in concert what he could not alone,and he created his languages and broughtinto being the first nations of Earth. Butw i t h s t r u c t u r e c a m e t y r a n n y a n druthlessness, and I saw that what skills Imight teach would be as a two-edged blade,having power both for and against man.And I was beset by confusion and doubt,and so sought again the counsel of Satan.Am I, who am myself the true Daimon ofjudgment, not to indulge in my own art? Isaid. May man not know but the referenceof system and order and not their abuse?But Satan answered, Would Asmodeus thenlighten for man the challenge before himand so lessen the strength of Will that hemust attain to conquer Uriel? I would not,for then would we yield to our ownpleasure, and man should become theplaything of Hell as well as of Heaven.Indeed we may give our tools to man as hemay comprehend them, but he himself mustbe entrusted with the direction of their use.But this I will tell thee - that not only inmatters scientific shall Hell tutor man. For wewould not have him view mechanism alone- 85 -as the hallmark of his progress, else wenever had cause to challenge the cosmicmechanism of God itself. Into the workingsof the mind of man we shall conveyaesthetic sensitivity and artistic restlessness,and he shall not view his achievementswithout considering their improvement to histemporal pleasure.Thus advised, I returned to Earth, and Itempted man with glimpses of the marvels tobe entrusted to him. I bent over the patheticworkbench of the starving alchemist andwhispered to him keys that one day wouldorder the course of great foundations. Inudged explorers to the ends of the Earth,and I flung an apple at Newton when hisobtuseness vexed me! To Democritus Ispoke, and I saw the radiations of energyfreed from matter both build and breakman’s world. And man neglected not hisown design, for in minute life he found clueto his own, and scarce hints of the originalcreation. And Asmodeus led mathematiciansand astronomers to the wonders of thefirmament, and I walked within the thoughtof scholars on quiet evenings. And that mannot attempt mastery of his environmentbefore himself, I spoke of government toKhem and Hellas, to the dynasties of Ch’inand Ashanti and Tenochtitlan, and withingreat capitals and mean villages alike I spokeof the brotherhood of all man, and of hiscorrelation to the forces of Earth and thoseof the Universe beyond Earth.- 86 -And I brought life and adventure andachievement to man, but each gift was aswell a tool for destruction and death, andmore oft than not were the ages of manfraught with terror and war, for Urielceased not his work ever to turn managainst man. And I knew that Asmodeusalone should not complete man, but thatforces other than mine should approach thedefinition of his infinity.[index-87_1.jpg]- 87 -6: AstarothAstaroth am I, Daimon of Senses, who bySatan was charged to complement thesciences of Asmodeus, for Satan said, As Ihave given man awareness of himself,Asmodeus shall teach him knowledge of hisworld and of the Universe. But to what availwould this awareness and knowledge bewithout admiration for and appreciation ofthese things?I said, Indeed, were man to have no emotionwithin him, he would incline to the end ofHeaven, pursuing a Universal mechanism forits own sake alone. Even were man toachieve absolute physical mastery over theGod-Cosmos, he would have no means tocomprehend the measure or the significanceof his accomplishment save through thatdetached sensitivity to aesthetics which isthe craft of Astaroth. For the Satanic Gifta w a k e n s m a n a l s o t o i n t e l l e c t u a ldetachment, to the ability to view hisprogress and plans from an extra-scientificbase of emotional pleasure.- 88 -Whereupon I came to Earth with Asmodeus,and even as he spoke to the intellect ofman, I brought meditation and introspectionto the artists and authors of humansensitivity. And man came not only to usehis Satanic power but to recognize theextent of the freedom which it promised him- the subjugation of all behavior to his Willand not to natural or mechanical laws.To man came fantasy and imagination, andthe appreciation of contrasts between thereality of his accomplishments and thei l l u s i o n s o f t h e i m p o s s i b i l i t i e s a scircumscribed by the logic of God. And everas man reached new heights of materialachievement, so also he confronted thebarrier of the Will of God, which permittedno deviation from its law.And man was long satisfied to measurehimself within this limit, for he wasintoxicated by his ability to harness theforces of the Cosmos to his whim. ButAstaroth said, Close not thy eyes havingseen only this much, for, were thou to bringall the systems of God to thy use, still wouldthy comprehension be bounded by the limitsof these laws and the acceptance of thedivine order as the finality of thy race.So I confronted man, saying, Throughoutthe Universe hath the once single Will ofGod been succeeded by the balance ofperfect opposition, wherein the forces ofthe Angels of Heaven and those of the- 89 -Daimons of Hell act to mutual frustration,serving in concert only to uphold the greatbarrier of Will between order and chaos.And man is the child of imbalance, who shallresolve the issue between Heaven and Hell,and who, unmatched by racial antithesis,shall transcend the rule of the order of Godand establish the eternal freedom of theSatanic Will.And I said, Not through thy physical andphilosophical sciences art thou to achievethis thing, for thy mind and Will must betrained anew in empirical conception. Manmust create his own order independent ofall external imposition. And not until hemasters this power may he aspire to the endof his Satanic evolution.A n d a s m a n t u r n s n o w i n f i r s tcomprehension and cautious exploration ofthis new direction of his Will, so Astarothconcludes the synthesis with Asmodeus. Theera of our companionship with man drawsto a close, and to Earth is now come thethird great Daimon of the bond between Helland man, and with his presence is the dawnof the Satanic Age proclaimed.- 90 -[index-91_1.jpg]- 91 -7: BelialHail, man, who shall bring to the end of theUniverse the glory of thy Satanic Will! I amBelial, who bring to thee the third great keyof Hell, by whose power ye shall confoundall the laws of Heaven and Earth. Beforethee shall chaos fall, and thou shalt wield fort h y s e l f t h e g r e a t m y s t e r i e s o f t h emacrocosmos. I speak to thee of that whichis called the Black Magic, for it is true spawnof that great Black Flame which firstbrought thy Will to life long ages ago.To council with Satan I also was called, andthe Lord of Light said to me, Into thycharge, Daimon of essence, I give theessence of my own being, the Black Firewhose power alone can effect creation byforce of Will. Against thee who wield theBlack Magic no law shall stand, and thus Icall thee Belial, who art One WithoutMaster. And as I have bequeathed thisessence to thee, so let it come finally to man,who shall overcome the great balance andbring to the Flame a change, for in- 92 -supremacy it shall become Red with theperfection of the Will of man.And to Earth came Belial, to view theteachings of Asmodeus and Astaroth. And Isaw that Satan, who himself oft chancedcompany of men, spoke of the Black Flameto the first Magi of men, testing their Wills inthe control of the raw forces of the Cosmosunbound from the law of God.And in his innocence man knew not themajesty of the Flame, using its lesser powersfor finite and minor alteration of the divinelaw on Earth. And as man might unleash theFlame beyond his skill to master it, Satansaid, Belial, the Black Flame cannot inclinemerely to the base ends of orderedexistence. Man must recognize the ultimatepotential of my Gift ere he destroy his veryrace through its abuse. Convoke therefore aChurch of Satan to tend the Black Flamewith care and wield it with wisdom,preserving for man this key to infinite Will.And I answered, So it shall be, and thisChurch of Satan shall herald the glories ofthe Satanic Age of man. The days of theGod-churches shall pale with decay anddissolution, and the realm of Messiah uponEarth shall crumble to ruin with the comingof the Satanic man.To those who would dare the Black Magic -Know that what ye accept is the verymastery of all that ye have supposed- 93 -impossible, by force of Will alone. The BlackMagus need fear no power save his own,but he must conquer his own Will that hecause not his destruction through ill chanceor purpose. Satan himself is not God, andHell can offer no salvation to those whoabuse the Gift of Satan. For the Gift itself isbeyond the control of Hell once given, beingsubject to the Will of the Black Magus alone.For Hell doth bequeath to man his perfectfreedom, and such a gift can never berecalled.Farewell, O man, who art atonce child and father of the Universe!Remember the future which is thine, andknow, now and forever, that Hell entrusts tothy care the guardianship of the eternal Will.- 94 -[index-95_1.jpg]- 95 -8: LeviathanBefore God or Angel, Daimon or man, therewas Leviathan alone, principle of continuityand ageless existence. By relation and time Ihave oft been sought, but Leviathan shallyield to none other than the final master ofthe Universe.Leviathan is the absolute, man, and if thouwould presume to realize what neitherHeaven nor Hell may effect, know that whenthou behold the presence of Leviathan, thyend hath been attained.Only through obliteration of the Universethat is may man seal his mastery of theBlack Flame, for only thus may he knowthat he is not subject to a greater Will.Heaven must perish, Hell must perish, andman alone must remain ere the Black Flamebecomes Red in the glory of its perfection.Then the Red Magus shall behold onlyLeviathan, and he shall recognize that hehas become the perfect mind, who shall- 96 -remake the Cosmos in the eternal glory ofhis Satanic Will.[index-97_1.jpg]- 97 -IILuciferGloria Caeli- 98 -[index-99_1.jpg]- 99 -Backstory:The Original “Lucifer” EssaysFor the 21st-Century reader of the originalSatanic Bible to understand and appreciate AntonLaVey’s twelve “Book of Lucifer” essays, a time-machine trip back into 1960s’ American popularculture is essential.Because from the perspective of the anything-goes amorality of post-Millennialism, theinformation-overload of Internetrality, and a blaséimpatience with anything but hyperstimulation,these diatribes can seem pretty tame and simplistic.But even in Haight/Ashbury San Franciscomorphing from the Beats to the Hippies, this wasomigosh experimentality with “occult” tidbits notonly unknown but unavailable to the general public.While the “occult revival” of the 1960sproduced a scattering of New-Age touchyfeely andfluffybunny Wiccawitchery, classic works of magicand metaphysics were both rare and expensive.Bookstores like Fields’ in San Francisco, Gilbert’s &Cherokee in Hollywood, and Weiser’s in New Yorkkept their Necronomica in locked glass cases, whichone needed to be “known” to access.Although in the years prior to 1966 Anton &Diane LaVey had conducted an exclusive “Magic- 100 -Circle” at their San Francisco home, the Church ofSatan was intended to be accessible to the generalpublic, whose ideas of things like “Satanism” and“Black Magic” came from horror movies and E.C.Comics.So Anton gave weekly lectures on these“Lucifer” subjects, along with additional funzies likehaunted houses, phrenology, and cannibalism. 37The mimeographed “rainbow sheet” handoutsat these lectures began as expansions of paragraphsin the Church’s informational Monograph, andtwelve of the most popular ones were selected forthe Satanic Bible. 38The intent of the original “Lucifer” wasdramatic and polemical: to shock readers out oftheir Sunday-school-complacency. It was a literarywater-balloon.But there’s no need for that now. In keepingwith Satan’s Foreword, the purpose of this “Lucifer”is to “explain reality”. If that sounds presumptuous,just consider how little, and carelessly, most peopletend to think about these chapter-topics. One wouldsuppose that they would be seriously important tohumanity, but just try asking such questions [ofthose who’ve not yet read this book]!As you peruse the new “Lucifer”, somethingelse may occur to you: that you know these answersalready, intuitively. This, as Plato realized, is acharacteristic of “universal truths”, as well as asignal that there is considerably more to humanintelligence than incarnate education through the37 Diane wasn’t beyond serving audiences some exotic finger-food scandalously represented as actually that.38 “The Book of Lucifer” has rather more cachet than “Churchof Satan Frequently Asked Questions”.- 101 -physical senses. He called this “recollective wisdom”anamnesis, and devoted one of his Dialogues, theMeno, to its illustration. So you are about to enjoy aMeno experience.But let’s start with a look-back at Anton’soriginal essays:A. “Wanted: God - Dead or Alive!”Assuming that most people who sought out aSatanic religion had a chip on their shoulder aboutconventional Judæo/Christianity, this cornerstoneessay flings the requisite gauntlet down, establishingpro forma that the Church of Satan was not afraid to“provoke divine wrath”.Scant attention is paid to identifying “God”save as the Deistic model of a non-conscious“balancing force in nature” with no interest inhuman affairs.Therefore prayer to God is pointless, and “sins”are merely dictates of conventional churches fortheir own agendæ.Satanism thus regards “injustice” as a purelyinter-human matter, with practical hurts beingcorrected by corresponding helps.Interestingly over the Church of Satan’s decadeof experience, relatively few Satanists nursed anobsessive hatred of God, or even thought muchabout him/her/it. If there were hatred, it wasusually the result of bad personal experiences inconventional religious affiliations.Accordingly there was not much interest in epicceremonials to cast God down from his celestialthrone, as in Anatole France’s Revolt of the Angelsor Ralph Vaughan Williams’ Job: A Masque for- 102 -Dancing. Most Satanists were content just to put atack or whoopie cushion on it.B. “The God You Save May Be Yourself”Following from the first essay’s Deism,Satanists assume the role of “God” in deciding andjudging “good/evil” in human behavior.Avoiding a conceptual discussion of ethics, thisessay just relaxes blissfully into individualhedonism.In the pre-rainbow-sheet Monograph, Antoncalled for the Church’s eventual construction ofsybaritic “pleasure domes”, somewhere betweenHugh Hefner’s Playboy Clubs and the elites’ gardensin Thea von Harbou’s Metropolis. In the early daysof the Church, Anton enjoyed several artisticcollaborations with Hollywood decadent KennethAnger, whose Magic Lantern Cycle of films includesan “Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome” to give youthe general idea.C. “Some Evidence of a New Satanic Age”Fun is poked at Christianity’s famous “SevenDeadly Sins” - pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony,wrath, sloth - blessing Satanists’ Indulgence in andenjoyment of them all. As of course do Christians,hypocritically whining “the Devil made me do it!”Continuing on the theme of hypocrisy, Antondenounces “safe” labels such as “humanist” and“white witch” as sanctimonious posturing.If one acts under illusions imposed by others,then one can plead the excuse of ignorance orinnocence. But if one is free from such constraints- 103 -and engages in self-delusion, one is simply ahypocrite: clearly the “deadly sin” of Satanism.D. “Hell, the Devil, and How to Sell YourSoul”In the fourth essay Anton traced the legend of“the Devil” through some of its more prominentmanifestations in Eastern and Western culturaltradition, punctuating the account with a list ofseventy-seven names under which the Archfiend orhis close approximations have been known. Thepoint to be taken being that “Satan” was to beappreciated as something more significant than amere Judæo/Christian myth.The following from one of the “rainbow”handouts, later adapted for this essay, catches itsflavor:Satan, as a god, demi-god, personal savior,or whatever you wish to call him, was invented bythe formulators of every religion on the face of theEarth for only one purpose. That purpose is topreside over carnal, mundane, and so-calledwicked activities and situations.Of course anything indulgent or gratifying ofa physical or mental nature must be “evil”; howelse can people be assured of feeling guilty withoutactually going out and hurting others?“Selling one’s soul” was dismissed as a simplefantasy of conventional religious paranoia. 3939 In 1970 this didn’t prevent my new Nineveh Grotto inKentucky sending the Central Grotto in San Francisco a checkfor its initial members payable in souls, not US$. We weretaking a chance that they’d be worth at least $13 apiece.- 104 -E. “Love and Hate”Conventional religions characteristicallyadvocate blanket love of humanity paradoxicallycombined with a similar hatred of its sinfulness.This elicits guilt, obligation, penitent obedience: thenominal emotions being tokenexploited as rhetoricalplatitudes.Satanism emphasizes selectivity and clarity inemotional judgment and expression, indeed to thepoint of magical ritualization.Emotions all too easily and habitually areexperienced so indistinctly that it has become thenorm to treat them as social attitudes andrelationships. This essay responds at this level ofdiscourse.F. “Satanic Sex”The 1960s were also famous as a time of“sexual revolution”, but it was slow in starting, evenin sordid San Francisco.Through the 1950s burlesque40 dives werepiously quarantined in a one-block “InternationalSettlement” on Pacific Avenue in North Beach. Butthen fingercymbalist Allen Ginsberg published hisflagrantly fornicative poem Howl with LawerenceFerlinghetti’s City Lights Beats-bookstore, while ahalf-block away on Broadway Carol Doda sentshockwaves across the entire country by by doffingher décolletage.40 In those tasteful times, only as far as G-string & pasties.- 105 -Anton LaVey enjoyed coining aphorisms,among them “sex and religion will always sell”. 41 Sohe was quick to publicize the Church of Satan with a“Topless Witches Revue” 42 by Doda’s Condor Club.But even more scandalous were the Church’saltars, on which the brooding Baphomet wasudderly upstaged by a beauty in the buff. Thisparticularly peeved Christian competitors with a2,000-years-desiccated deadguy on a torture-treeabove their altars.No one had more fun than the press, as whenone local newspaper reviewed the 1969 Satanis filmabout the Church:This has been a hard piece to write becausethe subject is so crazed …It’s a documentary. One cat in a dark suitand shoes with white socks says, “Yeah, before Ijoined the Satanic Church I masturbated once aday and was very unhappy about it. Now Imasturbate three or four times a day and really digit.” During one ritual a naked woman takes a largesnake and rubs it over her body, up and down inher crotch, passing her hands over its length andwrapping it around her. Then she gives it to Anton,who’s dressed in an open-front hood with horns,all in black. He takes the snake over to a plumpblonde, bound naked to a post, and proceeds to41 Similar Satanic sagacitickles included:• A bird in the hand is useless when you want to blow yournose.• Don’t ever sit on a stone bench with a glass bottle in yourback pocket.• If you are a lady, do not wear patent leather shoes becausemen will see your underpants reflected in them.• A crowded elevator smells different to a midget.• Never shove your mother while she’s shaving.42 Starring T-witch Susan Atkins in her pre-Manson Familydays. Cf. my The Church of Satan for the lurid details.- 106 -touch its head to various parts of her body, aroundeach breast and down to the cunt. 43Actually outside its ritual chambers, theChurch of Satan was scrupulously staid. Individuals’promiscuous proclivities were considered entirelytheir own business. 44 The result was an adultatmosphere in which sexual issues, should theyoccur conversationally, were considered both calmlyand courteously.G. “Not All Vampires Suck Blood”Anton LaVey’s weekly lectures included one on“classic” neck-nibblers like Count Dracula andBarnabas Collins, but for this essay he was moreinterested in something less sanguine: humans whotry to avoid confronting their own worthlessness byfirmly attaching themselves to one or more creativepersonalities and seeking to control and exploitthem thereafter.Such is what Anton called a “psychic vampire”,the defining characteristic being that the PV has noindependent identity or accomplishments of anysignificance, and is only influential through use ofthe host.A PV identification is not always easy to make.An obvious exception would be a marriage in whichone, the other, or both spouses subordinatepersonal, independent accomplishment to the familyas a whole beneficiary. PV questions might apply43 Ogar, Richard in Berkeley Barb, March 1970. The snake wasa pet python named Julius Squeezer.44 With absolute prohibition of anything involving minors ornonhuman animals. Julius’ appearances were carefully gentle.- 107 -only if one or both individuals should cease thatcommon-interest motivation for an exclusive one.The same problem exists in business andprofessional relationships as well. There is normallysome degree of benefit sharing or exchange, andPVism enters the picture only if the relationshipbecomes predatory.Anton offers no easy remedy to PV victims. Thepredation is possible only if the host is dependentupon the vampire’s control, which may haveprogressed to the stage of inescapable addiction.And of course there is the question ofperspective: What appears to a third-party to be abenign relationship may be PV behind-closed-doors,or vice-versa.H. “Indulgence, Not Compulsion”As with psychic vampirism, the concept of“indulgence” is not just a question of lifestyle, but ofits motivation and actual enjoyment or benefit.Imitation of an admired figure is a commonhuman practice, and often may extend frominconspicuous personal affectations to obsessive,complete makeover.There were any number of admirers who, afterseeing Anton LaVey in a magazine or on television,promptly shaved their heads, grew goatees, anddressed in black - certain that now they too wereSatanists.When inviting my suggestions concerningapplications for the Satanic Priesthood, Anton listedseveral attributes he thought preferential, theninsisted they be kept secret:Naturally I wish “preference given to”omitted from requirement questionnaires which- 108 -are sent to aspirants. Otherwise we will have themrunning out and buying dogs they can’t stand,marrying spouses they can’t stand, and eating foodthey can’t stand at restaurants they can’t afford. 45Besides imitation, indulgence could also becompromised by simple insincerity. In the “rainbowsheet” addressing this, Anton commented:The Eastern mystical beliefs, which havebeen in great intellectual favor in recent years,have taught people to contemplate their navels,stand on their heads, avoid the use of labels in life,and discipline themselves against any consciouswill for success so they might dissolve themselvesinto “Universal Cosmic Awareness” - anything toavoid good, healthy self-satisfaction or honestpride in earthly accomplishments.I am sure you have seen just as many so-called disciplined yogis with the inability to controla smoking habit as anyone else, or who becomejust as excited as a “less aware” person when anattractive member of the opposite sex [or in somecases the same sex] walks by.Yet when asked to explain their faith, thesepeople retreat to the ambiguity characterizingtheir faith - being that no one can pin them downif there are no straight answers that can be given.Another problem with compulsion is that, ifthere is no convenient, socially-acceptable releasefor it, it can devolve into self-destructive obsession -sometimes to the point that it transforms theaffectee into a maniacal [and tiresome] evangelist orapologist for it: a martyrdom often encountered in“aggrieved” religious, racial, and sexual circles.In 1928 Abraham Merritt wrote a novel entitledSeven Footprints to Satan, not about the Devil butrather a freakish human mastermind who modeled45 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, January 6, 1972.- 109 -his personality and pleasures after those of theArchfiend. 46 He commanded a global following ofinfluential and powerful personalities, bound to himnot only by fear but by admiration and respect.But there was another dimension to “Satan’s”character. In an underground dungeon he wouldsummon before him a ghastly assortment of theruined, the helpless, and the hopeless of humanity -pathetic creatures for whom life had lost whatevermeaning it once might have had.To each of these poor, damned wretches“Satan” would offer a drink of a drug called Kheft inreturn for an appeal to him as God. And for a briefmoment after tasting the Kheft, the suppliant wouldforget his agony and obtain a glimpse of somefleeting memory dear to him.If anything were required to make such a sceneeven more hellish, it was the wanton, disdainfulcynicism with which “Satan” received eachobeisance and dispensed each chalice of the Kheft.Anton LaVey’s Utterance of Indulgence provedliberating to the few who could handle it, butunfortunately a kind of Kheft for those who couldn’t.As long as the Word was inspired by Satan, it was anUnholy Grail of personal divinity.But after 1975 Anton’s contempt for even hismost fawning sycophants was glaringly obvious toold confidants. The famous “Do Not Ring UnlessYou Have An Appointment” plaque by his doorbellnow seemed to say: Lasciate ogni speranza, voich’entrate.46 Cf. Chapter #11.B.2.- 110 -I.“On the Choice of a Human Sacrifice”Devil-worshippers of the Dennis Wheatley typeare presumed to have a penchant for ritual murder,so now Anton addressed the notion of sacrifice ingeneral and of human sacrifice in particular.At its most elemental level, “sacrifice” impliesthe giving-up of something precious to oneself inreturn for some other benefit or favor.Humans being the selfish creatures they are,however, it has always seemed preferable to give up"},{"pageContent":"something precious to someone else in order toobtain the expected benefit.In its most savage form this has entailedreligious mutilation or murder, but civilization hassucceeded in refining it to the scale of moderninternational wars with little trouble, gloating overenemy casualties and pinning posthumous medalson one’s own.And so Anton’s first prescription was simplythat the Satanist should not destroy an innocentanimal or human being to avenge or appease self-generated insecurities. If a sacrifice is felt to benecessary for a magical ritual, then the sacrificeshould be a true one - involving the magicianhimself.Lest it be thought that he was advocatingsuicide, Anton hastened to point out that a trueSatanist, harboring no conscious or subconscioushatreds towards himself, would have no reason toseek self-destruction. He would experience joy andfulfillment through life, not death.What of the destruction of others per the law ofthe jungle? After all, “Might is Right” seemed to saythat vengeance was not only acceptable butadmirable.- 111 -Here Anton chose his words carefully. A truegod will not draw the line at murder, because hisdivinity enables him to decide issues of life anddeath with absolute justice. But the Satanic Biblewas written not for gods but for imperfect humanbeings who, if licensed to murder, would do so forequally imperfect reasons.Humans, sensing this imperfection, haveaddressed it by legitimizing murder only at thenational level. Logically the imperfection remainsuncorrected by such a solution, inasmuch as a greatmany imperfect judgments do not combine to forma perfect one even if a consensus of opinion isreached.For the fledgling Satanist, then, Antonrecommended a purely ceremonial exercise in thepassing of divine judgment by the symbolicdestruction of individuals determined to deserve it.The idea was that the magician, forced toconfront a mock reality of his wishes, would therebybecome increasingly more objective in making themand would approach, if not necessarily attain a trulydivine perspective in adjudging the conduct ofothers.It was a tactic that succeeded. Again and againSatanists who began their magical careers recitinglong lists of curse victims gradually decided thatthey were being rather excessive in theircondemnations. Finally they would becomeextremely discriminating in wishing any harm at allon others, realizing that clashes between humanbeings occur for many reasons besides unwarrantedpersonal hatred.The most advanced Satanists, Anton LaVeyincluded, pronounce almost no curses at all. Thetrue Satanist, in Nietzsche’s words, has passed- 112 -“beyond good and evil” to a level of existence whereall interactions of nature are seen in perspective.This is the Law of the Jungle in its highersense, as perhaps Kipling meant to express it whenhe wrote his Jungle Books.J. “Life After Death Through Fulfillmentof the Ego”Satanism glorifies life and rejects forms ofabstinence based upon presumed reward orpunishment in a posthumous Heaven or Hell.Does this mean that the Satanist must becomeresigned to a termination of his conscious existencewhen his body wears out, his heart stops beating,and his brain cells decompose?Life and happiness in life are not favorsdispensed by a God or Devil. Life is a biologicalincident of non-conscious natural law, andhappiness in life is the product of an individual’sown desires and skill at realizing them.Consequently, suggested Anton, people shouldenjoy life as much as they possibly can.Such a statement would seem rather trite wereit not for the fact that a great many people work veryhard at not enjoying life.In ancient and medieval times, to be sure, thecommon man confronted an existence fraught withuncertainty, peril, and poverty. With the vision of amind that was not wholly that of a natural beast, heresented his physical prison. He took such modestpleasures as he could, and, desiring more, he createdgreat fantasy worlds for himself where he could notbe oppressed by feudal lords, ravaged by theelements, or wasted by hideous diseases.- 113 -But even this escape was to be denied him,since others, sensing the power of such visions,determined to control them. They began to dictatethe visions and to impose punishments forunauthorized ones, and so man created religion.That delicate, beautiful quality in the humanmind that had enabled it to reach out to the starswas crushed on the rack of the Inquisition andreplaced by what Anatole France called “densefumes of theology”.As turgid as they were, the life-after-deathreligions made the misery of life at least a little lessmiserable by holding out the hope of salvation andredemption in the afterworld. It might be a falsepromise, but it was comforting - and it could not beexposed as a lie until too late.As civilization continued its upward lurching,the life of the common man gradually becamelonger, healthier, and more affluent. It stands toreason that it should have become happier, but thiswould have weakened the hold of the great religions.So they told man that he should feel guilty forenjoying himself, because such enjoyment wassupposed to occur only after death.By another of those almost incredible ironies ofhistory, this idiotic proposition was believed acrossalmost the entire range of modern civilization. Therewere those who denied it, and there were those whoexploited it, but on the whole it prevailed.Only in the most recent times, when it hasbecome so difficult to avoid having fun that mostpeople have given up the battle [and the guilt], havethe life-after-death religions begun to lose their gripand their power.Anton LaVey did not start this revolution, nordid he lead it in a demagogic sense, but he did- 114 -articulate it far more succinctly and essentially thananyone else had managed to do.In magical terms his Utterance of Indulgenceshattered all philosophies and theologies notincorporating this principle.But, Anton continued, there was more to “life”than mere material metabolism.As the mind increased in power and self-awareness, it became less a prisoner in its physicalshell and nature-governed mode of existence. Couldit be that this process might continue to a stage atwhich the ego could break free altogether andbecome entirely self-contained? The entire thrust ofSatanism seemed to lead in this direction. At thetime of the Satanic Bible’s writing, Anton was notprepared to be more definitive, but it wassubsequently one of the principal areas of ourmutual interest and investigation.K. “Religious Holidays”There are three principal unholi-days on theSatanic calendar - one’s birthday [commemoratingone’s own deification], Walpurgisnacht, Halloween- along with the approximate dates of the annualEquinoxes and Solstices.L. “The Black Mass”In his final “Lucifer” essay Anton exposed thetraditional stereotype of the Black Mass as anexercise in anti-Satanic propaganda. Were actualSatanists to perform such a ceremony, he said, itwould be for psychodramatic, illustrative purposesand not because of any intrinsic magic in the satire.- 115 -He concluded the essay with a brief account ofsome of the more abortive attempts at Satanismsince the 17th Century: the Chambre Ardentescandal of Versailles, Sir Francis Dashwood’sHellfire Club, and the quasi-Rosicrucian offshoots ofturn-of-the-century Europe such as Britain’sHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.),Germany’s Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), andAleister Crowley’s Order of the Silver Star (A.'.A.'.).Crowley’s significance as a magician was rathercondescendingly dismissed, probably becauseAnton’s chief exposure to him at the time had beenthrough John Symonds’ unflattering biography TheGreat Beast.* * *M. Concerning the New “Lucifer” ChaptersAgain, these chapters are arranged in order ofdescending complexity - not in the same topic-sequence as the original ASLV essays. Thoseoriginals used terms and assumed concepts which,by these new standards, were not adequately definedand explained. This was fine for the Satanic Bible’spolemical purpose, but not for this ReVision.Each of the following “Lucifer” chapters hasbeen intentionally constructed as an introductorysummary only. Following the 1968 completion of theoriginal Satanic Bible were eight years of researchand experience by Satanists, and then forty more byInitiates of the Temple of Set.N o n - i n i t i a t o r i l y t h i s R e V i s i o n d r a w sextensively from academic, governmental, andindependent resources as indicated in the text, nots,and bibliography. By all means pursue any such- 116 -leads as attract your interest following thisintroductory “Satanic Scout Handbook”.Since this ReVision is intentionally in thevernacular and iconographic tradition of Satan andSatanism, I have tried to use that “lens” wherepossible, and not that of Egyptian & Setiandiscourse. That said, there are certain topics, like theactual composition of human individuality, forwhich J/C-genre language is simply, indeed woefullyinadequate, requiring you to “think [if not walk] likean Egyptian”.And so ...Descende, audas viator, et terrestre centrumattinges. Kod feci.Descend, audacious traveler, and you will reachthe center of the Earth. I did it.Arne Saknussemm, inJules Verne,Journey to the Center of the Earth, 1864[index-117_1.jpg]- 117 -9: UniversesA. Objective (OU)The Objective Universe (hereafter “OU”) iswhat most humans are accustomed to regarding as“the only” universe, e.g. the totality of matter andenergy in existence [of which these same humanswould just assume themselves to be components].Humans are aware of the OU because theybump into it all the time, from stubbing one’s toe toexamining galaxies through telescopes. Thissurrounding is so constant and pervasive that theyare physically and physiologically “addicted” to it:Removing such constant sensory reinforcementnormally produces disorientation followed by panicand “insanity”. For the vast majority of humanity,ironically, it is thus the impress of the OU uponthem which provides and reinforces their“individuality”.Humans have gradually realized that the OU isnot chaotic and haphazard; it exists and functionsaccording to inflexible regularities, normally knownas natural - or, as they are discovered, “scientific” -laws (NL). In prehistoric and primitive cultures,before such laws were known to exist and be thus- 118 -inflexible, the OU was assumed to be a variable atthe manipulative whim of gods/God, andconsiderable effort was devoted to worshipping orappeasing such entities to prevent natural disastersor cataclysms. Of course there were/are enoughrandom interactions of NLs to lend credence to“divine intervention” explanations, particularlywhen preached to ignorant masses.Conventional questions concerning the OUinclude:(1) How did it come into being?(2) Why is it organized as it is?(3) Who created NL?(4) Why is NL so completely andpermanently enforced?(5) Does the OU have a purpose, or is itjust a gigantic accident? And of course:(6) What is/should be humanity’srelationship to the OU?Obviously humanity has been accustomed toaddressing, if not answering many of thesequestions by religious myth. It is easier for theordinary mind to visualize a God impulsivelysnapping the OU into existence at a chosen point intime, for example, than to grapple with the fact thatit has always existed; no “creative act” wastherefore needed.As for NL, human science has no idea whateverwhy it is what it is, or what enforces it. Science- 119 -contents itself with discovering and codifying suchNL “as it is”, period.B. Subjective (SU)The Subjective Universe (hereafter “SU”) iseach self-conscious being’s perception of the OU,blended with personally-generated overlays,selective impressions, and creative imagination asinstinctive, indoctrinated, inspired, and/or initiated.Thus not even the most controlled physicalscientist can claim to accurately and completely seethe OU. What he sees is his filtration and distortionof it through his SU, which he has built up bothconsciously and subconsciously from innumerablesources since birth.More creative, artistic, mystical, etc.personalities may let their SUs run even more freely,to the point where the OU is of only occasional andnecessary relevance to them. If some such personsreach a stage where their SUs have completelyreplaced the OU, they may be called “insane”; in thissense “sanity” is a measure of an individual’ssuppression of his SU within socially-sanctionedboundaries.1.Collective (CSU)When more than one SU is present andinvolved in any society or problem situation, itshould be obvious that no two of them will coincide,both in terms of subconscious “reality perception”and conscious values, desires, and actions applied.Hence both human society and human historyis most accurately understood as attempts by theinvolved humans to reconcile their conflicting SUs- 120 -into one or more community-approved CollectiveSUs (hereafter “CSU”).Sometimes this is possible through peacefulmeans such as education, reasoning, or argument.In other instances where conscious SUs are toopassionate, or when subconscious SUs are tooinflexible and intolerant, the individuals/groupsmay resort to coercion - aggressive and intensiveindoctrination, conditioning, and reinforcement,along with the suppression or extermination of theoffending “competitors” - to achieve the desired“reality”.In modern society, unsurprisingly, suchcoercion and intolerance are invariably attributed to“the enemy”, domestic outlaws, insurgents,revolutionaries, or other “alien” individuals orgroups. It is assumed, without any need forargument or justification, that the community CSUinto which its members have been conditioned sincebirth, is not just one among many options, but is“reality”. Questioning it thus goes beyond acceptablecuriosity to “heresy”, “treason”, or “insanity”.This was most famously caricatured in GeorgeOrwell’s novel 1984, in which failure to accept theParty’s CSU not just at the conscious but at thesubconscious “reality” level was condemned as theworst of all possible sins: “thoughtcrime” -correspondingly requiring not just punishment but“curing” by destroying the offender’s ability to see“reality” other than through the Party’s CSU.- 121 -C. Dimensions471.Ding Nicht An SichTime by itself does not exist at all. It issomething which exists only apart from itself, in theeyes and intelligence of a distinct consciousness(D5). It is the language by which that D5 detects,estimates, measures, and compares the changes ofand between existential phenomena displacing thethree dimensions (D1-3) of physical extension in OUspace. In principle, if there were no such changes,time would, and could, not exist.2. KantThis interpretation of time was most famouslyarticulated by the German philosopher ImmanuelKant (1724-1804), who in his Critique of PureReason (1781) contended that space (D1-3) and time(D4) are independent of, yet dependent upon oneanother in order to make them sensible concepts.Summarily:• Different times are successive, notcoexistent.• Different spaces are coexistent, notsuccessive.In other words, time is necessarily an arbitrarymeasurement of elapse, which can exist only asa sequence, a continuum.47 In this discussion “#D” refers to the dimension(s) proper,while “D#” refers to an item or event of such dimension(s).- 122 -As for spatial objects or defined areas [ofemptiness], they necessarily displace a single “pointin time”, more precisely a “moment without time”in order to be absolute in themselves: Two D3scannot displace the same 3D locus simultaneously.3D space, Kant argued, is objective, that isindependent of external perception.Time, on the other hand, is subjective: Itexists only in the mind of an external perceptiveconsciousness (D5), as an arbitrary, convenientmeans of demarcating changes in D3s themselves,and/or compared to other D3s.That time has the illusion of objectivity ismerely because of conventions among perceivers(CSU) establishing a common standard of suchmeasurement, such as a “minute” or “hour” basedupon the Earth’s solar orbit.3. EinsteinThis simple and self-evident distinction ofKant’s would be attacked by Albert Einstein in hisconfusingly-named “theory of relativity”, in whichhe insisted against all sanity that time is not asubjective relationship but an objective constant,thus mandating rigidly-calculated absurdities suchas an everywhere-fixed velocity of light: leading tosuch derivative preposterities as “curved space” and“black holes”.Eventually Pavlovian science will extricateitself from this tar-baby, or so one can only hope.4. NoumenonSince time is an arbitrarily-assigned valuation,Kant continues, it is not empirical: It is not gained- 123 -or learned from observation of NL phenomena.Rather it is a priori; it is assigned to OUphenomena, including, significantly, before andafter they occur. Such concepts would not bepossible in a genuinely-empirical environment.5. Objective Universala. D1-3Length, width, height: These measurementsestablish the existence of an OU substance, whethermatter or energy, that exclusively displaces emptyspace.Nothing else of the OU can occupy the samespace simultaneously.Note, however, that for D1-3 to have meaning,this displacement has to occur at a moment orduring an interval of time. This is where D4 comesin.b. D4D4 is popularly called “time”, but as previouslynoted, that is a very ambiguous term. So D4 is betterdefined as duration, meaning the endurance of theexistence of a D1-3 OU item.D4 is still a function completely within theOU, and this is crucial to its correct appreciation.Duration - “extension in time” - requires apoint of comparison, a benchmark. A 3D itempersists against/when compared to another 3D item,creating the function of measurement.Thus if the Earth existed alone in space, itwould be impossible to ascertain or state that it isstationary or moving. The moment that you add the- 124 -Sun and measure the Earth’s orbit around it interms of an arbitrary standard like “miles” and“hours”, it becomes possible to state that the Earthis traveling 70,000 mph relative to the Sun.So 4D requires at least one other OU itembesides the 3D one being described.Here we also se the correct and only use of theconcept of “relativity”. By its very name andintrinsicality, “relative” is a comparativemeasurement; it has no absolute existence.So when Einstein stated that the velocity oflight is an OU constant at 186,000 mps, he wasasserting a conceptual impossibility. And it was thisabsurdity that generated the entire procession ofderivative absurdities, from “curved space” and“wormholes” to “black holes” and “string theory”.Procrustes’ bed, which all of his visitors “perfectlyfit” by having their extremities rack-stretched oramputated as appropriate, has become the officefurniture of “accepted” physics.6. Subjective Universala. D5Rod Serling got it right in his cutenigmaticwelcome to the original Twilight Zone televisionseries:There is a fifth dimension beyond that whichis known to man. It is a dimension as vast as spaceand as timeless as infinity. It is the middle groundbetween light and shadow, between science andsuperstition, and it lies between the pit of man’sfears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the- 125 -dimension of imagination. It is an area which wecall the Twilight Zone.48Again, 1-4D exist within and are functions ofthe OU.But for a D3 OU item to be significant, it mustbe encountered or perceived by another D3 OU itemor items, thus establishing 4D relationship potential.Hence in the illustration above, the Earth’sorbit & speed around the Sun have a direct OUsignificance to both in terms of the various NLforces involved: climate, electromagnetic fields, etc.The distinction between self-consciousintellects [such as Man] and merely instinctivestimulus/responses is - as illustrated by the “Gardenof Eden” myth - the ability & prerogative to assignmeaning to phenomena; this is an attribute ofdivinity.“Meaning” includes but is not limited tomorality, so Adam & Eve’s “sin” was not being ableto recognize Good & Evil where decreed by El49, butassigning such values in disregard of his.“Meaning” is not an OU-function. It is assignedby an intelligence from a necessarily external 5Dperspective. Such a consciousness-generated realityis called a SU.Each SU can exist wholly independent(Serling’s “imagination”) of the OU, or it can serveas a “lens” to perceive and meaning-assign OUphenomena.Because of the uniquely-different perspectivesand meaning-assignments of each SU-generating48 Serling, Rod, original narrative introduction for TheTwilight Zone, 1959.49 The original & true name of the Canaanite god adopted bythe Hebrews.- 126 -externality, there is no such thing as “objectiveperception” of the OU. What SU-externalities maycall “objective reality” is actually an agreed-uponand/or enforced CSU. CSUs may be supported byanything from opinion popularity to instruments toestablish the appearance of objectivity.Thus NL exists authentically in and of the OU,but humans habitually perceive, interpret, anddogmatize it through the currently-dominant CSU.“Established” CSUs may be the result ofanything from institutional-academic cliques tosocial or religious agendæ and taboos. What isessential from a propaganda standpoint is that anagenda-driven CSU never be acknowledged assuch, but insisted to be objective, scientific OU-reality. “Heretics” are duly silenced and punished -more politely but just as effectively as being burnedat the stake.7. “Higher”?There are no OU dimensions beyond 1-4, andto be precise D1-4 items are identifiable by such alabel consequent to being assigned this meaning bya D5 intelligence.Einsteinian CSU may imagine and attempt toOU-include not just misinterpretations of D4, but“string theory” D5+ mathematical nonsenseproceeding from such factually-false premises.Completely within a SU, of course, a“dimension” may be reconceptualized as freely andartistically as desired as in H.P, Lovecraft’s or ClarkAshton Smith’s tales, with no explanation or OU-substantiation either needed or pretended.Entertainment is intended; ulterior-motivedeception is not.[index-127_1.jpg]- 127 -10: TimeA. FrameSo we’ve established that D4 is a measurementof duration or elapse between two or more OU D3phenomena. And that as a D5 you have the optionand the power to orient or tie yourself to the OU, orto exist wholly within your D5 SU, in which case youcompletely control any D1-4s in that SU. Of courseyou may also be either voluntarily or forciblyinvolved in CSUs affecting your incarnate body andmental conformity.So what does this “simple” situation have to dowith “time” and “religion”: the topic of this chapter?Well, it’s like this: Conventional (OU-aligned)religions not only assign you slave-tasks; they giveyou a time-limit (your incarnate lifetime) in whichto accomplish them. Even if you’re not entangled insuch a religion, you may find yourself in varyinglevels of similar time-limits from powerful CSUsintentionally or ignorantly in step with them.The best way to bring this into manageablefocus is to introduce the concept of the Two Paths:- 128 -1.The Two PathsThe terms Left-Hand Path (LHP) and Right-Hand Path (RHP) refer respectively to the goals ofrecognizing and emphasizing one’s individualseparateness from the OU, or rejecting thatseparateness in favor of [re]union with the OU. 50To put it another way, the LHP seeks individualdivinity, while the RHP seeks [re]absorption inexisting OU divinity.The paradox of the RHP is that it prescribesincreasingly stronger individual coherence andeffort to successfully meld with the OU; it is thissame personal coherence that strengthens andemphasizes separate individuality. The closer theRHP initiate comes to comprehending the essence ofthe OU and thus enabling immersion or dissolutionwithin it, the stronger the definition and assertion ofhis distinction from it.In short, the only way the RHP initiate canqualify to merge with El without corruption is tobecome a complete mirror-consciousness ofEl, at which stage melding or absorption isseamless.50 Historically the terms LHP & RHP originated in Tantrism, aschool of Vajrayana Buddhism in northern India which taughtthat Buddhahood can be realized through various theurgicpractices. For mantra and mudra ceremonies the female waspositioned to the right of the male; for erotic rites she waspositioned to the left. Theosophy’s H.P. Blavatsky felt sex-magic to be immoral and perverse, so she subsequentlyemployed the term “LHP” to characterize the magical systemsshe didn’t like, and the term “RHP” the ones she did, i.e.Theosophy. As used herein the two terms have no moralconnotation.- 129 -But ironically that presents a new paradox: Isthe “new” El the original or the copy - and, after all,does it even matter?The LHP is often accused of arrogance, ofrebellion. But the LHP initiate does not seek toreplace or eliminate the OU/El, while that isultimately what the RHP initiate aspires to do: soperfectly that the synthesis will be not justundetectable but indistinguishable.2. Conventional/RHP ReligionConventional religions incorporate one of twoconcepts of time: linear or cyclical. 51What all Western religions have in common isthe linear time of Judaism. Jewish mythologyposits a “Genesis” of creation, followed by a time-unidirectional, everything-&-everyone-inclusiveforced-march to a final “Apocalypse”. 52This linear-time scenario is microcosmed ineach human’s lifespan: It has a beginning, anincarnate-life ordeal of trial and obedience, and anend/consequence. You’ve got just one shot atexistence, so you’d better make it come out inAnaheim.The principal Eastern religions - Hinduism andBuddhism - are cyclical, not linear. The line of time51 In Satanic/Setian initiation there are two different time-concepts: circular [per Egyptian metaphysics] and timeless.For discussions of these see my books MindStar and FindFar.52 Even in a cultural climate of materialist deism, this linear-time model is reflected in the “one-way” Big Bang image ofcosmology. Theoretically it would be just as possible toenvision a cyclical universe of endless expansion/contractionoscillation.- 130 -keeps moving onward in a “Great Mandala” 53, towhich souls keep returning in endless up/downreincarnations, until/unless they’re nirvan ically-perfect enough to escape it into Eternal Bliss( Ānanda).In any NL-alignment religion, everythingdepends upon whether your curriculum ofperfection & reinclusion in El is intended to beaccomplished in the course of one lifetime. If it is,the Jewish linear-time model suffices. This is thestrategy of Torah Cabalism.B u t i f y o u r c u r r i c u l u m p r o v i d e s f o rincompletion, or inadequate purification, thenyou’re up against a dilemma: If there’s an inevitableHeaven/Hell, and instead of a life of passiveobedience and/or the acceptance of Grace, you’ve“brazenly” presumed self-purification/perfectionthrough Cabalism, any inadequacy or incompletionwill doom you not to Anaheim, but the L.A. freewaysrush-eternity of Sheol.The Catch-22 of the Eastern reincarnationistreligions is that your previously identity & memoryare flushed with every reembodiment. If you madethe mistake of murdering a bodhisattva, resulting inyour punitive reincarnation as a centipede, you can’tlearn not to bite another one’s ankle.At least if you’re a Christian or a Muslim, Jesusor Mohammed has promised to intercede for you ...maybe, if you don’t fall below the Grace standard.If you’re Jewish, you’re screwed, becauseunless an acceptable Messiah shows up before youkick the bucket, no redemption for you is possible,53 with an appreciative, sentimental nod to Peter, Paul, andMary.- 131 -and you’re headed inevitably and eternally toSheol. 543. Satanic/LHP ReligionSatanists will doubtless be gruntled to hear thatyou’re neither going to reappear as a centipede norrot in Sheol, nor frantically abase yourself in hopesof getting on Jesus’ or Mohammed’s Grace roster.As previewed in Chapter #13.C, the priests ofEgypt discovered a far more interesting transition inyour postcarnate Xeper. Peter Pan got it right: “Todie will be an awfully big adventure!” 55B. ExTensions1.Cultural RecordingIn Earthly affairs of concern to Satanists, OU4D measurements are of interest in the lineardivision of major cultural movements, for instancethe Renaissance and Enlightenment of Europe.However such delineations become decidedlymore problematic and less reliable as one looksfurther back into the periods before permittedhistory.2. MetamorphosisOur earliest evidence of mankind dates toabout one million years ago.In South Africa a large number of fossilremains of mutated apes has been found. Classified54 Sheol is sort of like Mordor, only worse. Cf. Chapter #13.B.55 Barrie, J.M., Peter Pan, 1904.- 132 -as Australopithecines, these pre-men possesshuman-like hip and thigh bones in addition toenlarged cranial capacities of between 400cc and600cc. Conventional theories of evolution cansubstantiate the continued mutation of this man-apeto the stage of Pithecanthropus Erectus - a skullfragment found in Java with an estimated capacityof about 900cc.Later versions of Pithecanthropus haveevidenced skulls of up to 1,100cc. And here weencounter the enigma of the “missing link”. 563. Modification or Mutation?The Java remains date to the Lower-Paleolithicperiod - about 800,000 years ago. The next twodefinitive ancestors of modern man, Cro-Magnonand Neanderthal, did not appear until the Middle-Paleolithic period - about 100,000 years ago.There is some question, then, about the interim700,000 years. Nor is this the only “missing link”period.Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal, who wereapproximate contemporaries, possessed cranialcapacities respectively of up to 1,700cc and 1,500cc.How and why did these startling enlargementsoccur? And why was Cro-Magnon’s cranium inparticular larger than that of present-day man, whoaverages 1,400cc?The Diabolicon identifies this change inprotohumanity as the Black Flame of Satan. In the56 “Missing link” is out-of-favor among contemporarypaleontologists, because it implies too simple & linear a chainin theoretical ape-to-human evolution. The politically-correctreplacement is “transitional morphologies”, which only blursand jargonizes the phenomenon.- 133 -Egyptian Book of Coming Forth by Night and Wordof Set, it is known as the Gift of Set.Less shockingly to profane sensibilities, it iseuphemized as a rectangular black monolith in2001: A Space Odyssey. 574. 95,000 Years of ?In addition to the “link” (which could havebeen instantaneous or gradual, and longer ago than100,000 BCE), there is the obvious follow-upquestion of what humanity did with its newpotential thereafter - roughly the 95,000 years untilthe earliest surviving recorded history of ancientEgypt. Consider: 95,000 years is rather a long timeto do nothing, then suddenly embark upon a 7,000-year binge of “civilization”.Inevitably this resurrects the ghost of Plato’sAtlantis, as representative of a higher humancivilization prior to the earliest accepted records ofdynastic Egypt. Observed one noted archæologist:Hoffman brings out in his book that thehook we hang Egyptian dynastic dating on,particularly the early dynasties, is a list fromManetho, an Egyptian priest at Sebennytos in theNile Delta around 280 BCE. We have it today onlyin fragments, but it’s still the hook, so to speak.That’s how we get the usual 30 dynasties, andconventional Egyptologists are more or less happywith that.57 This 1968 film was a collaboration between two avowedatheists: director Stanley Kubrick and author Arthur C. Clarke.While Clarke took the idea of a “human development monitor”from his 1948 short-story The Sentinel, less-known is that theconcept of external alteration of human intelligence came fromhis 1953 novel Childhood’s End, in which it was the gift ofDevil-image aliens.- 134 -What they’re not so happyabout is that Manetho’s list goes on quite a waysbefore Menes, before the accepted date of 3100BCE going backwards:350 years Thinites;1,790 years other Memphite kings; 1,817 yearsother kings; 1,255 years “Heroes”; and before that13,900 years in which the Neteru - the “gods” -reigned physically on Earth. That’s where Manethostops. 58Christianity’s and Islam’s diligence inobliterating “heathen” history leaves modernhistorians and archæologists with substantiallyfewer resources than would otherwise survive.Concerning just the famous Library of Alexandria:In 389 CE a Christian mob, acting on theorders of the Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius,burned the great library to the ground. 59Even so, millions of book-rolls were rescued orgathered together from other repositories and thelibrary was reestablished - until 636. In that yearAlexandria was taken by Omar, the Third Caliph ofIslam, who decreed: “The contents of these booksare in conformity with the Koran or they are not. Ifthey are, the Koran is sufficient without them; if not,they are pernicious. Therefore let them bedestroyed.” They were burned as fuel to heat thecity’s baths; it took six months for all of them to beconsumed. 6058 Jones, Harford I., conference call with Paul Kantner, LindaReynolds, & M.

The OU Satanic AgeIf there is an OU Satanic Age, it falls generallywithin the OU 4D of 100,000 BCE to [ongoing]. Ifthere is a question concerning this situation, it mayhave more to do with its OU-byproducts thanhumanity’s own utilizations and satisfactions. As theworld is generally aware, scientific knowledge ofatomic disruptions has resulted in weapons which ina matter of minutes could extinguish life on theplanet.Also uncontrolled overpopulation and overuseof resources threaten to destroy the biosphericbalances which have made Earth a generallyhospitable environment.To the extent that humanity’s discretionaryintelligence has made these irresponsible andultimately self-destructive excesses possible, it is aGift that definitely has its ominous side.Brought to mind are is the admonition of Belialin the Diabolicon:For Hell doth bequeath to man his perfectfreedom, and such a gift can never berecalled.62 Lecture, Daniel Jackson, Ph.D., Scottish Rite Temple, 4357Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, 12/11/1992.

Subjective Universal TimeSince all elements of a SU are willfully created,time-factors and measurements thereof areinfinitely malleable and variable, includinginconsistency and contradictory interrelationships.At first glance this appears to be insanity, butunder the control of a seasoned magician it simplyaugments a medium of complete, discretionaryelasticity.In a given SU the magician can accelerate,slow, or freeze time. He can himself move and actseparately within any such adjusted scenario, inorder to effect or facilitate the desired outcome.The utility of such options and skills increaseswith SUs which are extended to others’ perceptionand influence. A common example is stage-magic, inwhich the magician intentionally distorts anddeceives the audience’s senses of time and space tocreate entertaining illusions of altered, seeminglyimpossible reality.In mundane human affairs, such as politics andeconomics, CSUs are routinely created andmerchandised to manipulate populaces and/orcustomers. Such creators usually don’t think ofthemselves as “magicians”, of course, but rather asadvertisers. publicists, or politicians. But theoperational methods have a common basis; theprincipal difference lies in the true magician’s farmore knowledgeable subtlety and rigorous sense ofpersonal and professional ethics.At the sociocultural level, CSU time may bepromulgated to be one of the principal determinantsof the social order. In ancient Egypt, for instance,the operative CSU time was circular, not linear [asthe Hebraic and most modern habit]. Civic virtue in- 138 -Egypt was to be found in an appreciation of andalignment to the neteru; perfection was exemplifiedin recurrence, such as the Sun’s and stars’ “orbits” ofthe Earth.Another, less-refined and -inclusive model isthat of cyclical time. This was characteristic ofsocial systems, as those of pre-Christian Europe, inwhich linear change was perceived and toleratedwhere necessary or functional; but other periods,among them the seasons and flora/fauna cyclesneeded to be respected for the society to survive andprosper. The famous Stonehenge is an example of acyclical calculation mechanism. 63D. ÆonsAs far as most occultists are aware, referencesto æons began with Aleister Crowley’s much-advertised Æon of Horus, which he proclaimed tohave followed first the Æon of Isis (roughly pre-Christian paganism) and then that of Osiris (roughly2,000 years of Christianity). Since Crowley’sunderstanding of Egyptian mythology wasessentially that of the Osiris/Isis/Horus trinity, thistied Western civilization up into a nice, neatpackage.Not only was Crowley responsible for bringingabout the Æon of Horus, we are told, but that ofOsiris as well - in a previous incarnation as the HighPriest of Osiris [and Priestess of Isis] Ankh-f-na-khonsu. The story of this is told in his memoir ofthat incarnation, “Across the Gulf”, in Equinox #I-7:63 Cf. Hawkins, Gerald & White, John, Stonehenge Decoded.New York: Hippocrene, 1988.- 139 -But Thoth the mighty god, the wise one, withhis ibis-head and his nemyss of indigo, with hisAteph crown and his phœnix wand and with hisankh of emerald, with his magic apron in the threecolors; yea, Thoth, the god of wisdom, whose skinis of tawny orange as though it burned in afurnace, appeared visibly to all of us. And the oldMagus of the Well, whom no man had seen outsidehis well for night threescore years, was found inthe midst; and he cried with a loud voice, saying,“The Equinox of the Gods!”And he went about to explain how it wasthat Nature should no longer be the center ofman’s worship, but man himself, man in hissuffering and death, man in his purification andperfection. And he recited the Formula of theOsiris as follows, even as it hath been transmittedunto us by the Brethren of the Cross and Rose untothis day ...In his own writings Crowley does not indicatewhere he came by this concept of “æons” or exactlywhat is meant by it. A little detective work, however,takes us back to the days of the Golden Dawn andthe writing of a book entitled Egyptian Magic byFlorence Farr, Scribe of the G.'.D.'., in 1896. Thisbook, part of a 10-volume series CollectaneaHermetica edited by W.W. Westcott, contained avery interesting chapter called “The Gnostic Magicof Egypt”, from which the following quote:Let us first consider the essential principlesof Gnosticism, which are briefly as follows:First - A denial of the dogma of a personalsupreme God, and the assertion of a supremedivine essence consisting of the purest light andpervading that boundless space of perfectedmatter which the Greeks called the Pleroma. Thislight called into existence the great father and thegreat mother whose children were the æons orgod-spirits. That is to say from the supreme issuesthe nous or divine mind and thence successiveemanations, each less sublime than the preceding.- 140 -The divine life in each becoming less intense untilthe boundary of the Pleroma, or the fullness ofGod, is reached. From thence there comes intobeing a taint of imperfection, an abortive anddefective evolution, the source of materiality andthe origin of a created universe, illuminated by thedivine but far removed from its infinitude andperfection.Now the Gnostics considered that the actualruler and fashioner of this created universe and itsbeings good and evil was the Demiurgos, a powerissuant from sophia or wisdom. By some it wassaid that the desire of souls for progression causedthe origin of a universe in which they might evolveand rise to the divine.The Gnostics definitely believed in thetheory of cycles of ascent and return to theevolutionary progress of worlds, ages, and man;the ascents & descents of the soul; the preexistenceof all human souls now in worldly life; and thesurety that all souls that desire the highest mustdescend to matter and be born of it. They were thephilosophical Christians.The rule of the Christian church, however,fell into the hands of those who encouraged anemotional religion, destitute of philosophy, whosemembers should be bound together by personalties of human sympathy with an exalted suffererand preacher rather than by an intellectualacceptance of high truth.The Gnostics dissented from the creed thenbeing taught, on the ground of the inferiority ofthe hero-worship of Christ to the spiritualknowledge of the supernal mind, which theyconsidered he taught.The Gnostics were almost universally deeplyimbued with the doctrines of Socrates and Plato;and a religion of emotion and reverence, combinedwith moral platitudes, did not seem to them of asublimity sufficiently intense to be worthy toreplace the religious mysteries of Egypt, India, andPersia, the theocracy of the Jews, or the sublimetruths hidden in the myths of Greece.- 141 -In Religion in Ancient History S.G.F. Brandoncomments:In his “First Epistle to the Corinthians” Paulhad occasion to contrast his teaching with that ofother systems known to his readers. In so doing hewas led to give this significant account of his own:“Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yeta wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of thisworld, which are coming to naught: but we speakGod’s wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom thathath been hidden, which God foreordained beforethe worlds unto our glory: which none of the rulersof this world knoweth: for had they known it, theywould not have crucified the Lord of glory” (ii.6-8). In our official English translations theproper meaning of this passage is obscured at twocrucial points. The Greek word translated as“world” here, severally in its singular or pluralforms, is aion, which does not mean this physicalworld or Earth, but “time” or “age”.]Paul’s use of aion here accordingly showsthat he was thinking in terms of an esoteric systemof “world-ages” that probably derived ultimatelyfrom Iranian and Babylonian sources, and that invarious forms was much in vogue in currentGræco-Roman thought. Next the words translatedas “rulers of this world” ( archontes tou aionostoutou) do not refer, as is popularly supposed, tothe Roman and Jewish authorities who wereresponsible for condemning Jesus to death. Theydenote dæmonic beings who were associated withthe planets and believed to govern the lives of menon Earth.As Farr and Brandon both go on to observe,Gnostic Christianity was regarded as a very seriousthreat to the Christian church and was intenselypersecuted. Had it become prevalent, the 2,000years might have evolved very differently in Westerncivilization - with a very intellectual, philosophical,and initiatory religious climate instead of the- 142 -intolerant, ferocious, and ignorant horror ofdogmatic Christianity.Now we are beginning to see this term æon in anew light. The Æon of Horus is not just a period ofOU time when ideas symbolized by Horus aredominant. Rather it is a Ding an sich, a noumenon:a CSU of purely rational apprehension, notperception by the senses.Thus in what one might term the Lesser BlackMagical (LBM) sense, an æon is simply anattitude which one chooses or is conditionedto adopt. This is what is meant by saying thatdifferent people “exist in different æons”: that a Jew,Christian or Muslim exists in the Æon of Osiris, aWiccan in that of Isis, and a Thelemite in that ofHorus.Accordingly, while æons are “pyramidal” insophistication, after the fashion of Plato’s “pyramidof thought”, there is no reason to consider themlinear-time-sequential, each new one supersedingand obliterating the one before it.In a LBM sense, therefore, the population ofthe world continues overwhelmingly in the grip ofthe Æon of Osiris, the best intentions of Aiwassnotwithstanding. The Æon of Isis is the nextinfluential, followed by that of Horus.The Æon of Set, of which the CSU Age of Satanwas the explosive harbinger, highest on the pyramidand demanding to comprehend and indwell, is themost rarified and exclusive of all.As with degrees of initiation, it would beexcruciating if not impossible to spend all of one’stime in a “higher æon”. When we go about ouraffairs in the profane world, we are usually Osirians,peering with curiosity and vague alarm at ecologicalactivists (Isis) or avant-garde artists (Horus). Yet- 143 -we experience periods of Isis and Horus too - and,when we wish to, that unique Æon of Set.Crowley, who suggested that æons were OU-linear in “catastrophic succession” - I presume inorder to more forcefully advance the cause of theÆon of Horus - predicted in the Equinox #I-10 thatfollowing the ÆH:... will arise the Equinox of Ma, the goddess ofjustice. It may be a hundred or ten thousand yearsfrom now (1913), for the computation of time isnot here as there.In 1921, in his “new comment” to Liber Legis,Crowley speculated that the next æon would be thatof Thmaist, third officer in the G.'.D.'. Neophyteritual. On the other hand, he continued, “It may bepresumptuous to predict any details concerning thenext æon after this.”Is there a Greater Black Magical (GBM)sense of æonics as well?Seen through the lens of GBM, an æon is in facta living entity, in which its initiates are “cells”.This is the secret which the Gnostics broughtfrom antiquity, and which so frightened theChristian dogmatists.The “god” of an æon is thus a creature of thetotal magical and philosophical energy of materialbeings who are initiates of that æon, i.e. who areaware that they are “avatars of the god”. [Are younow beginning to see the ancient origins of Hegel’sconcept of an “overmind”?]Understood in this sense, a GBM working is away of the “part’s” reaching out to contact,experience, and/or manifest the “whole”. This is whytrue GBM is not even remotely like “prayer” as theprofane practice it. Nor is it mere meditation, in- 144 -which the mind of the meditator merely extends toits own limits. It is the greatest secret, and thegreatest fulfillment, of unique existence.Once an æon is apprehended thus, a greatmany veils fall away, a great many mysteries of whatmagic is and why it works are revealed, and indeedthe entire “why” of human consciousness isabsorbed: the Grail is attained. All you need is thenœsis to perceive it; when you are ready for it, It willbe ready for you.[index-145_1.jpg]- 145 -11: Gods and DevilsA. Objective Universal1.MultipleOf crucial importance to an understanding ofthe OU is not just its existence and regularity, butthe reason why this regularity exists as it is, andwhy it is enforced in this configuration instant toinstant.As Aristotle realized, the whole of the OUnecessitates a prior genius to conceive, establish,and to continually compel its order andconsistency. This is the collective, interrelatedgenius of the natural neteru, whose existence is notmerely proved but necessitated by the OUomnipresence & omnipotence of NL.It is clear then that there is neither place,nor void, nor time, outside the heaven. Hencewhatever is there, is of such a nature as not tooccupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is thereany change in any of the things which lie beyondthe outermost motion; they continue through theirentire duration unalterable and unmodified, livingthe best and most self sufficient of lives… From[the fulfillment of the whole heaven] derive the- 146 -being and life which other things, some more orless articulately but other feebly, enjoy. 64This “Necessity Supreme” cannot be ignored:I find no hint throughout the universeOf good or ill, of blessing or of curse;I find alone Necessity SupremeWith infinite mystery: abysmal, dark,Unlighted ever by the faintest spark;For us the flitting shadows of a dream. 65Absent the neteru there is no explanation forthe OU’s existence vs. nothingness, for the almost-unimaginable intricacy of its constituent elementsand their interaction, and for the instant-to-instantidentity of these.Absent them there would simply be chaos in allOU phenomena, if indeed the OU existed in wholeor part by mere happenstance.The question follows: If the neteru exist andare prior to manifest OU existence, how did theycome to exist? Doesn’t this merely ratchet theproblem of “Creation” up one notch, leaving us withthe same dilemma?The answer is at once obvious and alien tohumans’ accustomed way of thinking, and it has todo with the concept of “time”.Time (4D) is an exclusively-OU phenomenon: ameasurement of change occurring relative to two ormore OU-objects or -energies. It is nonexistent,meaningless in the SU.The neteru exist in their respective SUs,from which they generate and order the OU.64 Aristotle, De Cælo, I.9, 279 a17–30.65 Thomson, James, The City of Dreadful Night, 1874.- 147 -This is, precisely, timeless. As such, there wasnever a “point in time” for their Coming Into Being,nor for their time-endurance. They simply are, ormore comprehensively in the Egyptian hieroglyphic,Xeper.Why should humans apprehend the neteru as amultiplicity [“gods”] instead of a singularity[“God”]?To some extent there neither is nor need be ananswer to this, as the complete OU-expression of theneteru is internally harmonious. How this harmonyis achieved is unresolvable by reason (Platonicdianoia).However there is a compelling argument formultiplicity, and it is once again the existence of Set:a neter completely distinct from and alien to thenatural neteru.A “divine singularity” would preclude such anexclusion; therefore what exists other-than-Set, tothe extent that it is indeed integral and harmonious,implies, if not indeed requires that it be divisibleand the parts each fully-functional in its ownessence.Beyond this, as the Egyptians, Pythagoras, andPlato also acknowledged, the neteru are notdiscernible through algorithmic reasoning withinthe mechanisms of the OU (the aforementioneddianoia), but only through the higher faculty ofintuitive apprehension: nœsis. This is a supremely-refined and -disciplined mental process achievedthrough the exercise of the Dialectic; it is not merephantasy or dreaming [though both of these arelesser manifestations of the mind’s suprarational,Setian capabilities].To the Egyptians, all of the OU is actively-alive: the direct consequence of the wills of the- 148 -neteru. Nature was intelligible not just throughinanimate, automatic, general regularities whichcould be discovered via the “scientific method”; butalso through connections and associationsbetween things and events perceived in thehuman mind. There was no distinction between“reality” and “appearance”; anything capable ofexerting an effect upon the mind thereby existed.Hence a dream could be considered just as“real” and thus significant as a daytime experience.No more eloquently has this been summarized thanby She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed to Allan Quatermainin ancient Kôr:[Allan] “I have heard of Isis of the Egyptians,Lady of the Moon, Mother of Mysteries, spouse ofOsiris whose child was Horus the Avenger.”[Ayesha] “Aye, and I think will hear more ofher before you have done, Allan, for nowsomething comes back to me concerning you andher and another. I am not the only one who hasbroken the oaths of Isis and received her curse,Allan, as you may find out in the days to come. Butwhat of these heavenly queens?”“Only this, Ayesha: I have been taught thatthey were but phantasms fabled by men with manyanother false divinity, and could have sworn thatthis was true. And yet you talk of them as real andliving, which perplexes me.”“Being dull of understanding doubtless itperplexes you, Allan. Yet if you had imagination,you might understand that these goddesses aregreat principles of nature: Isis of throned Wisdomand strait virtue, and Aphrodite of Love as it isknown to men and women who, being human,have it laid upon them that they must hand on thetorch of life in their little hour. Also you wouldknow that such principles can seem to take shapeand form and at certain ages of he world appear totheir servants visible in majesty, though perchancetoday others with changed names wield their- 149 -sceptres and work their will. Now you areanswered on this matter.” 662. Singular: Judæo/Christian ElThe roots of Judaism go back to Bronze Age(3300-1200 BCE) Canaan, on the easternMediterranean coast in the area of modernPalestine.The various Canaanite settlements, from whichthe nomadic Hebrews67 emerged as one of varioustraveling tribes, worshipped many gods, includingBa’al, Dagon, El, Tanit, and Moloch.The Hebrew Tanakh (“Old Testament” sourcetexts) specifically identify the later-renamed“Yahweh/YHVH/Jehovah” as El, one of the mostintolerant and bloodthirsty. As constant wanderersbetween, then encroachers upon Canaan’s stablecities and cultures, the Hebrews needed the mostvicious and threatening deity possible: both toterrorize their own, loosely-knit membership intocohesiveness and to propagandistically overcomeany sponsoring gods of invaded communities. Andso they adopted El.a.

XodusIf you thought you saw even a correct timelinein Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments, thinkagain: Neither Pharaoh Seti I nor his son Rameses IIimprisoned a nation of Hebrew slaves, and Ramesesdidn’t lose either his army to the Red Sea or his sonto an El-slaughter of Egypt’s firstborn. 70Nor did any of this occur during Rameses II’sreign:68 Cf. Gerald Massey, A Book of the Beginnings (Seacaucus,NJ: University Books, 1974). This work was the first of hisseries on the topic. Among the topics addressed: Egyptianorigins of practically every Hebrew and Christian myth, andEgyptian origin of the Hebrew language. Massey followed this2-volume work with two more equally-extensive sets, NaturalGenesis and Ancient Egypt, further developing anddocumenting this information.69 While in original Persian Dualism the powers and influenceof Ahura Mazda and Ahriman constituted a divine balance, theHebrews and their Christian/Islamic variations, have neverbeen able to resolve the dilemma of a supposedly omnipotentand good El with the existence of evil; the dilemma of theodicy.70 Rameses II was succeeded by Merenptah, the fourth son ofhis second wife, simply because by age 90 he had outlived all ofhis older sons.- 151 -Hard evidence of the Exodus event in thepreserving deserts of the Sinai, where most of thebiblical Wandering takes place, is similarly elusive.Although its climate has preserved thetiniest traces of ancient Bedouin encampmentsand the sparse, 5,000-year-old villages of mine-workers, there is not a single trace of Moses or theIsraelites.And they would have been by far the largestbody of ancient people ever to have lived in thisgreat wilderness.Neither is there any evidence that Sinai andits little natural springs could ever have supportedsuch a multitude, even for a single week.Several 19th-Century vicars recognized thisfact within a day or two of the start of numerousexpeditions in search of Moses’ footsteps.“Escaping from the rigours of an Englishwinter,” as one of them says, “in a land of the flockand the tent to which our only guide was the Bible”they quickly realized that the biblical Exodus waslogistically impossible and that the Bible was amost ambiguous guide to that desolate region.The biblical description of the Exodus, then,flies in the face of practical experience. Indeed thecloser you examine it, the further it seemsremoved from all of ancient history.” 71As for the Ten Commandments, El borrowedtheir content from the Egyptian-Hittite Treaties of1274 BCE ...The prologue of the Hittite treaty remindsthe Hittite king’s vassals of his benevolent acts..(compare with Exodus 20:2 “I am the LORD yourGod, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, outof the house of slavery.”).The Hittite treaty also stipulated theobligations imposed by the ruler on his vassals,which included a prohibition of relations withpeoples outside the empire, or enmity between71 Romer, John, Testament. New York: Henry Holt, 1988, page#58.- 152 -those within.” ( Exodus 20:3: “You shall have noother gods before Me.”).Viewed as a treaty rather than a law code, itspurpose is not so much to regulate human affairsas to define the scope of the king’s power. 72... but didn’t get around to his own version until atleast the 7th Century BCE. 73 This would havecorresponded to the [Kushite] XXV Dynasty of theThird Intermediate Period; Seti I & Rameses II wereof the [Setian] XIX Dynasty (1290-1197 BCE).c.RedEmptionIf you’re unlucky enough to be one of El’sChosen People (the Hebrews>Jews), you’re headedfor the extremely unpleasant Sheol when you croak,and that’s all there is to it.So when Jesus and Mohammed promisedOriginal Sinners a way out, they instantly got anattentive audience.And it sounded like a good deal: All you had todo was obey one of them, not El directly.“They”, institutionalized as churches andmosques, were nice as long as you unquestioninglyobeyed and paid taxes to support them.d. Exodus 22:18If you weren’t interested, or chose the wrongRedeemer for your locale, you had the choice ofeither converting or being tortured and killed: in the72 Bright, John, A History of Israel (4th Edition).

In short, if you havelittle or no confidence in the validity of your chosenor compelled religion, even the existence ofalternatives is an unacceptable threat and must beeliminated one way or another.Satanists/Setians feel no such insecurity,because this religion is based on solid premises. Theexistence, even the prevalence of the profane is thusa matter of disinterest, or, if considered emotionally,nuisance or pity.Profane religious neurosis and violence forceattention only when, as in the Salem witch-hunts or- 154 -the 1980s’ international “Satanic Panic” pogroms,degenerate profane fantasies concerning thisreligion explode into open violence and attemptedextermination.Ironically profane ignorance is so widespreadthat the victims of such vigilantism are more oftenthan not innocent bystanders who know no moreabout authentic Satanism than their Inquisitors.e. CabalEmptionAt least Christians and Muslims could nowbreathe easier: All you had to do to qualify forHeaven instead of Sheol was to surrender your willto Jesus’ or Mohammed’s representatives andconvert or exterminate as many heathens andheretics as you could reach.But El’s Chosen People, the Jews, not onlydidn’t have this promise, even if they kill every lastPalestinian and “intrusive” Syrian, Lebanese,Egyptian, and American74 inconvenient to “GreaterIsrael”. Comments Arthur Schopenhauer in Parega#I, 13:The Jewish religion proper, as described andtaught in Genesis and all the historic books untilthe end of Chronicles, is the crudest of all religionsbecause it is the only one which has no theory ofimmortality - not even a trace of it. Every king andevery hero or prophet is buried, when he dies, withhis fathers, and there is an end of the matter; notrace of any existence after death; indeed, as if74 On 6/8/1967 the Israel air force & navy attempted to sinkthe U.S.S. Liberty research ship in international waters,planning to blame it on Egypt. Annoyingly for Israel, some ofthe American sailors survived to expose this “false flag”operation.- 155 -intentionally, every thought of this sort seems tohave been removed.But Schopenhauer is only partially correct.According to Hebrew theology, the soul - which is ananimating force common to animals as well ashumans - survives as a “shade” which endureseternal imprisonment in a dark, dismal prison calledSheol, from which there is no escape, redemption, orresurrection. Whether the soul-being was virtuousor vicious in life makes no difference; Sheol awaitsall.But wait! If El hasn’t sent Jews a Redeemer ashe has Christians and Muslims, might there be a wayfor them to escape Sheol by redeemingthemselves?In the 13th Century CE Jews [and uncertainChristians] were offered a new hope for non-Messianic redemption from both Adam & Eve’sOriginal & their own additional sins. The SpanishJew Moses de León authored a series of books, theZohar (“Splendor”), claiming to reveal divinemysteries concealed in the Torah.The mysticism contained in the Zohar is knownas [Hebrew] Cabala (aka “Kabbalah”, “Qabala”,etc.). The word means “aligned” or “corresponding”,and purported to chart an initiatory pathway toredemption by personal effort alone. DesperateJews, as well as similarly-motivated Freemasons,Rosicrucians, Theosophists, and Thelemites eagerlymade the Cabala the core of their teachings.Moses de León ascribing the Zohar to the 2nd-Century rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who hid in a cavefor thirteen years studying the Torah and wasinspired by the prophet Elijah to write the Zohar.Unfortunately León’s widow confessed that herhusband had written it, using the prophet for profit.- 156 -This trifling quibble seems not to bother the legionsof Cabaloyalists, however. 75f.TauTheologyIn “Might is Right” Arthur Desmond waxesparticularly vehement on the subject of lies:The most dangerous of all enthroned lies isthe holy, the sanctified, the privileged lie - the liethat everybody believes to be a model truth.It is the fruitful mother of all other popularerrors and delusions. It is hydra-headed. It has athousand roots. It is a social cancer.The lie that is known to be a lie is half-eradicated, but the lie that even intelligent personsregard as a sacred fact - the lie that has beeninculcated around a mother’s knee - is moredangerous to contend against than a creepingpestilence.Popular lies have ever been the most potentenemies of personal liberty. There is only one wayto deal with them: Cut them out, to the very core,just as cancers are. Exterminate them root andbranch, or they will surely eat us all up. We mustannihilate them, or they will us.We have seen that the vaguely/mysteriouslyimpressive “God” turns out to be nothing more thanjust one of a number of savage, sadistic Canaaniteidols, first appearing millennia after far morebenign, articulate, and educational cosmologicalprinciples such as the Platonic/Pythagorean Formsand the Egyptian neteru.Without exception the “wisdom” attributed toEl turns out to be plagiarisms at best, maliciousdeceits at worst.75 Funk & Wagnalls, Jewish Encyclopedia.- 157 -The history of El-worship is an unrelentingbloodbath of torture and murder through thecenturies, in return for which this god promises itsservants an afterdeath eternity of nightmare in thedesolation and misery of Sheol.But before the Satanist can apply “Ragnar’s”remedy to El, the two “proofs of his existence” mostcommonly advanced by his cultists must bedemolished - which is not in the least difficult:Both “proofs” relate to the cosmologicalconglomerate of interrelated matter and energy: theObjective Universe (OU).The first proof, most famously advanced byThomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica (still thedoctrinal backbone of the Catholic Church), is anattempted application of Aristotle’s “unmovedmover” proposition: that if the OU exists, somethinghad to create it.That sounds reasonable, but actually isn’t.There is no reason to assume that existence followsnonexistence. The existence of the OU may just aslogically extend infinitely into the past and future,requiring no creator. 76It is to “pre-substantiate” this argument thatJudaism arbitrarily insists upon a cosmology of“linear time”, which requires a theoretical starting-point as well as ending-point: “In the beginning,”states “Genesis” - whereupon everyone from Adamto Albert Einstein is expected to salivate and salute.76 This principle - that there is no necessity nor cause forexistence per se - was most famously expressed by Frenchnovelist Jean-Paul Sartre. The protagonist of his Nausea ishorrified by the inexplicability of his own, hence the entireOU’s existence - ultimately being forced to admit that no“explanation”, no creative agency or rationale, is inherentlynecessary. [This is the core premise of Existentialism.]- 158 -But as the Egyptian sages recognized from theirearliest astronomy 77, time (4D) is actually anarbitrary measure of convenience internal to OUphenomena; it does not exist objectively beyond it.Therefore the cherished syllogism that theexistence of the OU requires El as a creator collapsesas a tautological fallacy.A second argument, obviously much morefanciful since it requires Biblical or testimonial faith,involves the existence of “miracles”: isolatedinstances of NL violations that would therebyrequire the interjection of an intelligence superiorand external to that NL. Examples would be theparting of the Red Sea by El (not Mr. DeMille),Jesus’ post-crucifixion revivals, or more currentlythe claimed miracles “by El through” Mother Teresaand Father Junipero Serra qualifying them forCatholic Church canonization as saints.However even if granting for the sake ofargument that incidents-as-claimed in fact occurred,it would simply mean that the existing definition ofNL in each case was inadequate and neededexpansion accordingly. NL “violation” is neitherrequired nor probable; once again the “proof of El”fails tautologically.And in the complete absence of anything theleast substantive to the contrary, no, it is notnecessary to “prove a negative” to dispense with El.Let his eradication be as that of one of H.P.Lovecraft’s particularly abhorrent villains:It can be compared in spirit only to the hushthat lay on Oscar Wilde’s name for a decade afterhis disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that77 Cf.

Toensure disciples got this, the Buddha made it hisfirst Noble Truth:Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth ofsuffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering,illness is suffering, death is suffering; union withwhat is displeasing is suffering; separation fromwhat is pleasing is suffering; not to get what onewants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha]subject to clinging are suffering. 79It may not be as intentionally sadistic as El’sinflictions, but Buddhists are stuck with it anyway;suicidal release will only trigger retributive karmaand reincarnate you as a centipede or an attorney.Buddhists’ only permitted relief consists ofexercises to dull and starve one’s consciousness intothe incoherent haze of nirvana. While mythicallypermanent for the Buddha and bodhisattva, it is amocking illusion for the ordinary adherent, whoobviously cannot escape the continuous demands ofhis body and environment.In Hinduism suicides are additionallycondemned to an undead, ghostlike torment on78 Lovecraft, H.P., “The Case of Charles Dexter Ward” in At theMountains of Madness.

The line of time keeps moving onward in a“Great Mandala” 80, to which souls keep returning inendless up/down reincarnations, until/unlessthey’re nirvan ically-perfect enough to escape it intoEternal Bliss ( Ānanda).B. Subjective UniversalThe Satanic religion is based upon the Principleof independent, self-aware consciousness external tothe OU and thus able to both perceive it and actupon it [as well as independently of it].In its most ancient apprehension by humanity,this was the Egyptian “neter not of the neteru” Set.As later seen through the lens of Judæo-Christian iconography, this Principle was identifiedas Satan.Here follows an introduction to each of thesevisualizations. Within the accustomed J/C culture ofcontemporary Western societies, Satan will be themost familiar image, with Set reserved to formalinitiatory contexts and environments.1.Egyptian SetNo records of the ancient Priesthood of Setsurvived first the Osirian-dynastic persecution andlater the more general vandalism of the Christian/Islamic eras. We know of it only by its reflection,both in the character of Set as he was portrayed80 ... with an appreciative, sentimental nod to Peter, Paul, andMary.- 161 -symbolically and mythologically and in the nature ofEgyptian priesthoods in general. Three significantfacts are known about the Priesthood of Set:(1) Together with the Priesthood ofHorus [the Elder], it was the oldest of theEgyptian priesthoods. If we date it to the earliestpredynastic images of Set found by archæologists,we can establish an origin of at least 3200 BCE.Working with the Egyptians’ own astronomically-based records, we may approximate 5000 BCE. 81 Ifwe are to assume the final eclipse of the Priesthoodat the end of the XIX-XX [Setian] Dynasties ca. 1085BCE, we are looking at an institution which existedat least two thousand and possibly as many as fourthousand years. “In the early dynasties,” observesBudge:Set was a beneficent god, and one whosefavor was sought after by the living and by thedead, and so late as the XIX Dynasty kingsdelighted to call themselves “Beloved of Set”. Afterthe cult of Osiris was firmly established and thisgod was the “great god” of all Egypt, it became thefashion to regard Set as the origin of all evil, andhis statues and images were so effectivelydestroyed that only a few which have escaped byaccident have come down to us. 82One may note that Set was by no means theonly “fabulous” creature ever portrayed by Egyptianartists. But he was the only one represented as aprincipal neter, as opposed to a purely-animalisticmonster of the Tuat.81 Lockyer, J. Norman, The Dawn of Astronomy. Cambridge:MIT Press, 1964, page #215.82 Budge, The Book of the Dead, page #181.- 162 -( 2 ) S e t w a s t h e n e t e r w h o w a s“different” from all of the others. Too oftenthis is simplified into his being the “evil” slayer ofOsiris, hence the personification of “evil”; yet anybut the most cursory study of Egyptian religioussymbolism is sufficient to dispel this caricature. Hewas rather a neter “against the neteru”: the entitywho symbolized that which is not of nature.This is a very curious role for a neter inEgyptian cosmology: to be a presence and forcewhich alone could not be apprehended byperceptions of the natural senses. Set thusrepresents the nameless “thing” whose existence weknow of by the shadow it casts on thingsapprehended and things perceived by it: the non-natural “presence of self” ( telos) in individualintelligent life.V a r i o u s p o s t - E g y p t i a n c u l t u r e s h a v egeneralized the vehicle by which this presence ismanifest as the spirit, psyche, or soul, but increasedprecision is possible. We must subtract from suchcrudeness what is “life force”, and focus ourattention on that which remains: the veryawareness of self. In doing so we have in onesense retraced the path of Descartes to the cogitoergo sum proposition. Unlike Descartes, however,we see this phenomenon to be a “thing totallyapart” which is not an extension of “God” oranything else. Set is the conceptualizer of thisprinciple: the designer. To rewrite the crucialsentence in the above quote from the point of viewof a neter: “A thing created in the mind therebyexists.”This is delicate ground to tread, so much moreso for an ancient Egyptian civilization whose entire- 163 -“natural” cosmology was based upon the perfectionand harmony of the Universe.(3) Despite this unique and disturbingimage, or perhaps because of it, Set becamethe patron of the two most powerfuldynasties in Egypt’s long history, the XIXand XX. Herein there is an interesting “theologicalsuccession”:The early XVIII Dynasty (ca. 1580-1372) wasthat of the great Amenhoteps, during whose reignsthe Priesthood of Amon at Thebes was preeminent.The dynasty disintegrated during the “Amarnaperiod” (ca. 1372-1343) of Akhenaten, during whichthe solar disk of Aton was considered supreme if notindeed all-inclusive of the neteru. When the newXIX Dynasty arose under Rameses I and Seti I, thestate role of Amon was restored - but the pharaohsdirected much of their efforts towards Set. RecountsSauneron:The new dynasty in power, careful to appearto be “restoring everything to order”, had manyreasons for mistrusting the Amonian priesthood.Descendants of a military family of the easterndelta, the new pharaohs were traditionally devotedto a god little esteemed by the masses because ofthe role that he had been assigned in the death ofOsiris. But they preserved nevertheless, here andthere, the temples and priesthoods of the god Set.The Amarnian experience had demonstratedthe cost of too abrupt a break with the beliefscentral to the entire nation, and of entering intoopen warfare against a priesthood practically aspowerful as the throne itself. Thus the politics ofSeti I (1312-1301) and of Rameses II (1301-1235)were infinitely more subtle than those of theirpredecessors. There was no rupture with Thebes;the constructions continued, and magnificentedifices were raised to the glory of Amon at- 164 -Karnak, Gourna, and Ramesseum. But it was fromthe [Osirian] center of Abydos that Ramesesappointed the High Priest of Amon. Then heinstalled two of his sons, Merytum and Khamuast,as the High Priests of Ra at Heliopolis and Ptah atMemphis, and demonstrated by furthermonuments and political favors his public supportof these gods. But finally, wearied of Thebes andits ambitious priests, he departed to build a newcapital, Pi-Rameses, in the eastern delta - where hecould quietly worship the god dearest to him, withAmon occupying a secondary prominence.The provincial cities where Set had beenworshipped from all eternity - among themOmbos, Tjebu, and Sepermeru - gained newpreeminence from the favor accorded by theRamesside leaders to the god of the Eastern Delta.Above all, Pi-Rameses, the new capital, brilliantlyrestored the worship that Set had formerlyreceived in the Avaris of the Hyksos. 83Following the passing of the two Setiandynasties, the increasing influence of a priesthoodnot courted by the Ramesside pharaohs - that ofOsiris - boded ill for the Priesthood of Set. TheOsirians recast Set as Osiris’ treacherous brotherand mortal enemy of Osiris’ son - for whom theyappropriated the neter Horus. Not content withattacking Set personally, they further appropriatedhis consort and son from the original triad of his cult- Nepthys and Anubis - whom they now describedrespectively as a concubine of Osiris and a son ofOsiris by Nepthys. Comments Budge:Between the XXII and the XXV Dynasties, aviolent reaction set in against this god [Set]; hisstatues and figures were smashed; his effigy was83 Sauneron, Serge, Les pretres de l’ancienne Egypte. NewYork: Grove Press, 1980, pages #183-184.- 165 -hammered out from the bas-reliefs and stelæ inwhich it appeared. 84Various reasons for this reaction have beenproposed by Egyptologists. It is been suggested thatSet fell into disrepute through being associated inthe popular mind with the Sutekh of the invadingHyksos. Possible, but improbable, as the Hyksosinvasion occurred prior to the XIX-XX Dynastieswhen Set was preeminently in favor - and thepresiding neter over Egypt’s greatest period ofimperial glory.Set’s eclipse may well have been due to a moresubtle, yet pervasive sentiment sweeping Egypt. AsSauneron and many other Egyptologists haveacknowledged, Egyptian philosophy was based upona millennia-old conviction of the absolute presenceand influence of the neteru, and in the virtue of asocial system in which the preservation of cyclicalharmony was all-important. While the New Empireof the XIX-XX Dynasties extended Egypt’s influenceto Palestine and Mesopotamia, it also made theEgyptians aware that there were many otherfunctioning cultures in which the neteru wereunknown [at least by their Egyptian names].Moreover the concept of Egypt as just one among anumber of nation-states competing for power andinfluence in the Mediterranean, rather than as theone civilization at the center of existence, must havebeen a most unsettling one to this ancient culture -which previously had been able to discount itsneighbors as mere uncultured, barbarian tribes.Egypt’s solution to this problem was to turngradually away from a glorification of this life and84 Budge, The Mummy. New York: The Macmillan Company,1973, page #276.- 166 -towards an orientation on the afterlife, where suchdisturbing dilemmas could be assumed not to exist.This would explain the growing influence andpopularity of the Osiris cult during the post-XXDynasty Egyptian decadence; Osiris was an afterlifeneter.As the Osiris cult portrayed Set as Osiris’nemesis rather than an independent and preexistingneter with no particular interest in Osiris, this wouldalso explain the simultaneous wave of Setianp e r s e c u t i o n d e s c r i b e d b y B u d g e . I t w a scharacteristic of ancient Egypt that each newdynasty, in an attempt to establish its own“timelessness”, often doctored monuments andrecords to eliminate inconvenient inconsistencies.Presumably the Osirian dynasties followed suit,defacing or rewriting all references to Set that didnot support their portrayal of him as a “Devil”. 85And that was the distortion of Set which survived inlater Mediterranean legend - principally throughPlutarch, who described it in some detail in hisMoralia. 862. Judæo/Christian Satana. “Please Allow Me toIntroduce Myself ...”In the earliest Hebraic mythology of the “OldTestament” in the Holy Bible, Satan was neither85 Ions, op.cit. , pages #72-78.

Gwyn Griffith’s TheConflict of Horus and Seth (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers,1969).86 Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, Volume V in Moralia.- 167 -disloyal to El nor an all-encompassing advocate ofevil, or even a Paradisian playboy. Rather he wassomething much more loathsome: an art critic. AfterEl devoted seven days to creating Adam & Eve tofornicreate a vast Earthrace, it was Satan whosuggested that he had somewhat overestimated hiscompetence and undertook to prove it by temptingeveryone from Eve and Jesus to Marilyn and Jack.This was par for the course with Hebrews, whoquickly realized that they’d picked a God whoalready had it in for them without any proddingfrom a staff angel.But things got more complicated after Satanand Jesus had it out in the wilderness. Now everyChristian was expected to emulate the Christ anddenounce the Devil (to which Satan was now pro- orde-moted depending upon one’s point of view.But one thing was also clear: He was muchmore fun.Anyone who has gaped at Walt Disney’sFantasia or Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, beenearavished by Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring orMendelssohn’s Die Erste Walpurgisnacht, or heardMick Jagger singing Sympathetically knows that inwhatever his guise the Devil is, well, a party animal.The first thing that members or guests noticed aboutChurch of Satan Grottos in the 60s-70s was thatthey were a bit friskier than their righteous rivals:Ritual chambers looked like sets fromUniversal 1940s’ horror classics, candles and torcheswere outflickered only by the glowing brazier ofblue/black flame in front of the nude “living altar”,spookygloomy crescendos were interruptedoccasionally by Lovecraftian litanies and perhaps aspasmodically-sparking Jacob’s Ladder, Tesla coil,or van de Graaf generator for a touch of Mad Lab- 168 -tech.

Thecrash of a Tibetan gong was loud enough to wake thedead, but it didn’t matter since they’d been invitedtoo.b. “... I’m a Man ofWealth and Taste.”But it would be grievously misleading toassume that Satan didn’t have his more æstheticambitions. In Abraham Merritt’s Seven Footprintsto Satan, his terrestrial avatar reflects::Call it - amusement. It is for amusementthat I exist. It is for that alone that I remain upon aworld in which, when all is said and done,amusement in some form or guise is the one greataim of all, the only thing that makes life upon ittolerable.My aim is, therefore, you perceive, a simpleone. But what is it that amuses me?Three things.I am a great playwright, the greatest that hasever lived, since my plays are real.I set the scenes for my little single acts, myfarces and comedies, dramas and tragedies, myepics. I direct the actors.I am the sole audience that can see everyaction, hear every line of my plays from beginningto end.Sometimes what began as a farce turns intohigh tragedy, tragedies become farces, a one-actdiversion develops into an epic, governments fall,the mighty topple from their pedestals, the lowlyare exalted.Some people live their lives for chess. I playmy chess with living chessmen, and I play a scoreof games at once in all corners of the world.All this amuses me.- 169 -Furthermore, in my character as Prince ofDarkness, which I perceive that you do not whollyadmit, my art puts me on a par with that othersuper-dramatist, my ancient and Celestialadversary known according to the dominant localcreed as Jehovah. Nay, it places me higher - since Irewrite his script. This also amuses me.The second? I am a lover of beauty. It is,indeed, the one thing that can arouse in me whatmay be called - emotion.It happens now and then that man with hismind and eyes and heart and hands makes visibleand manifest some thing which bears that stampof creative perfection the monopoly of whichtradition ascribes to the same Celestial adversary Ihave named.It may be a painting, a statue, a carved bit ofwood, a crystal, a vase, a fabric - any one of tenthousand things.But in it is that essence of beauty humanitycalls divine and for which, in its blundering way, itis always seeking - as it is amusement.The best of these things I make from time totime my own.But - I will not have them come to me exceptby my own way. Here enters the third element -the gamble, the game.Collector of souls and beauty I am. Gambleram I, too, and as supreme in that as in mycollecting. It is the unknown quantity, the risk,that sharpens the edge of my enjoyment of myplays. It is what gives the final zest to my -acquirements.And I am a generous opponent. The stakest h o s e w h o p l a y w i t h m e m a y w i n a r eimmeasurably greater than any I could win fromthem. But play with me - they must!8787 Merritt, Abraham, Seven Footprints to Satan.

Tolkienreintroduces him as the Vala (= ArchAngel) Melkor,whose contrast to God (Eru Ilúvatar) and the OUValar echoes Satan’s against El. 9188 Epicureanism was a philosophy of hedonistic ethics thatconsidered calmness untroubled by mental or emotionaldisquiet the highest good, held intellectual pleasures superiorto others, and advocated the renunciation of momentarygratification in favor of more permanent pleasures.89 Cf. Eric Towers, Dashwood: The Man and the Myth(London: Crucible, 1986), which offers evidence thatDashwood’s “occult” activities consisted largely of revels inhonor of Apollo & Bacchus with no overtly “Satanic” element.90 For a detailed, documentary history of the Church, seeMichael Aquino, The Church of Satan (2 volumes) (8thEdition). San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2013.91 Not too surprising, since Tolkien was personally a RomanCatholic.- 171 -Curiously both Melkor and his Maia (= Angel)Sauron are rarely seen or heard from in Tolkien’sepics - possibly because, like Prometheus or Lucifer,what they have to say to mankind is too dangerous.We learn of it only in the forbidden Morlindalë,wherein Sauron recalls Melkor’s statements to himat Utumno:“Alone of the Valar I question the purposeand will of Eru Ilúvatar,” Melkor answered. “Aloneof the Valar do I exist apart from him, hence cando so.“And so I tell you this: He is not cruel, anymore than he is benevolent. He is a force ofindifference and hazard in this universe, and whatappears here upon Arda is the result of that and nomore. “That is the truth and the curse of thisworld: that it is bereft of purpose. It is merely here,and it continues as its patterns, and accident, andthe force of contesting wills press it. Finally, as allenergy upon it is drawn inexorably out into thecosmos from whence it was fashioned, it will fade,grow cold, and go out.”“How then can you, who see this, endure it,O Melkor?” I asked. “Why linger in this terribleplace? Why do you not return to the great spacesbeyond, that such sad troubles dwindle tonothingness in the distance?”The Vala stood then, took my arm, and bademe keep silence. Back through the halls andcaverns of Utumno he guided me, the Orcs andother strange beings bowing to him as we passed.Finally we stood at the Gate of Utumno,looking out over the starlit sky of Endor. He swepthis hand across it that I should attend, then spokeagain:“O Sauron, if Endor has no purpose, it is I -we - who can give it.“If untended it knows only struggle anddeath, we can teach it pleasure and rest, if only alittle, despite them.- 172 -“If it would by itself only slowly decline, wecan see it marshal its energies to rise now inpower, then in artistry, and still again in love.“Each of these may be bought only by itsopposite, so its misfortunes shall also grow andebb in currents and waves.“But from all of this we shall raise itscreatures beyond themselves as fashioned by EruIlúvatar and the Valar; and some of them, perhaps,beyond the Ainur themselves.”Again Melkor turned to me, and in thedarkness his eyes burned into mine that I was nolonger of a certain where Sauron ended andMelkor began. Now his voice seemed to flowthrough and around me.“You, Sauron, shall learn more from me thanany Maia has of any Vala. But a time may comewhen Melkor shall no longer be, yet you shallremain, to preserve this wisdom, and indeed touplift it beyond the Maiar, perhaps beyond eventhe Valar.“In these journeys shall you know ecstasyunequaled in Endor, and anger and pain to shatterand mock it.“But this does Melkor promise you, thatnone shall live with your intensity, with yourperception of all thoughts and wills, and most ofall with your Eye.” 92An Ardan Age later, the Númenorean (=Atlantean) council of King Ar-Pharazôn confrontedSauron concerning the Valar’s denunciation ofMelkor as “evil”. Responded the Maia:“Evil is Melkor, evil am I his Maia,” saidSauron, “only if that same fire that burns nowwithin each of you is evil.“Melkor’s evil was his awareness of isolationfrom all else about him, and his wish and will toact with that perfect freedom.92 Sauron, The Second Scroll, Morlindalë. San Francisco:Barony of Rachane, 2003.- 173 -“For that and that alone was he feared andrejected by the other Valar; for that also I soughthim and swore myself to him.“And now, in the High Men of Númenor, Isee it once again awakened: this time in creaturesborn of Arda rather than of the spaces beyond it.“That is what the Valar will soon know. Thatis why they will seek to destroy Númenor as theydid Utumno, Angband, and Thangorodrim, leavingonly lesser, unawakened Men in Middle-earth toremain their vassals.“Ar-Pharazôn, my Lords, I need not arguethis truth, only utter it; each of you sees it asclearly, as inescapably for himself.” 93Neither Melkor nor Sauron survived the ThirdAge. As the Blue Wizard Pallando wrote:But I saw also that the magic hadgone from Arda. It was now only an ordinaryworld, populated by ordinary beings, Men andanimal. Never again upon it would there be a placefor Rings of Power. 9493 King Angmar, The Fifth Scroll, Morlindalë, op.cit.94 Pallando the Blue, The Ninth Scroll, Morlindalë, op.cit.- 174 -[index-175_1.jpg]- 175 -12: HumancarnationA. DefinidentityThe function of any religion is to explain theexistence of Man as a species of life intellectuallymore versatile than other animals, but stillsignificantly limited by the NL constraints of hisphysical body. 95Physics explains Man scientifically, e.g. as aphenomenon completely within the OU andfunctioning according to NL.Metaphysics includes physics, but adds anadditional aspect of reality beyond OU/NL: theexistence and influence of external/superior forcesand/or intelligences.1.PhysicsWhat distinguishes a religious explanationfrom a scientific one is that the latter assumes Manto be “just another animal”, hence completelydefinable within the NL properties of the OU.95 Herein “Man” include both genders.- 176 -Summarily Man is a machine, a mechanism,whose functioning is the product of matter/energyinteractivity and sensory stimulus/response.“Consciousness” is nothing more than anelectrochemical brain-illusion, and “individual will”may be incidentally discretionary but is for the mostpart mechanism-need predictable.“Life” is a temporary metabolic synchronicityof the cells constituting a body.When this collaboration ceases because of NLentropy, the sudden disruption of the same packageis called “death”, and the illusion of “personality”simultaneously and permanently disappears.OU science doesn’t consider itself competent torule on the existence or activity of discreteintelligences external/superior to the OU & its NL,e.g. “god/s”. Some scientists maintain that on theassumption that nothing can or does exist beyondthe OU/NL, this de facto proves the nonexistence of“god/s”.2. MetaphysicsA metaphysical explanation of Man may prmay be a “religion”. While that term ischaracteristically vague, it is used here to indicate ametaphysical reality in which gods exist andintercommunicate with humanity.Alternatively a metaphysical reality mayconsist of abstract/impersonal principles or forces,most familiarly analogous to the Pythagorean/Platonic “Theory of the Forms”.The importance of metaphysics is that it adds asignificance to humans, both individually andcollectively, beyond mere survival and reproduction.- 177 -In ancient Egypt the higher-evolutionarypotential of man was described by the hieroglyphicterm Xeper. In later Classical Greece the term wastelos. Both connote a “higher purpose” which, whileenergized and refined to the level of divinity, is notstandardized or predestined; it is more anaffirmation of potential.B. Manimal1.Conventional ReligionJudaism and its Christianity & Islam variantsrequire faith-belief in a metaphysical reality, butconfine metaphysical presence to the one god El,along with any “angels” and/or “dæmons” hecreates.El’s relationship with Man is strictly master/slave, with the purpose of Man having nothing to dowith his evolutionary advancement; his function issimply and strictly obedience.Indeed the point of the Garden of Eden episodein the “Old Testament” is that a Xeper/telos attemptby Man is the most heinous “sin” possible, resultingnot only in extreme punishment of Adam & Eve butof all their descendants: the entire human race. Elindeed establishes that he is a “jealous god”!While despite El’s efforts to prevent it - such asthe Great Flood and Tower of Babel - civilization hasadvanced to OU-scientific sophistication in theidentification and codification of NL, the samecannot be said of metaphysics. Much of it,particularly as involves the mass of humanity,remains under the heel of institutional Judaism/Christianity/Islam. Straying beyond their ideologicaldoctrines may be ignored in a few more liberal- 178 -countries as long as it is deemed frivolous andunthreatening - as in “New Age”, Wicca, Neopagan,Native-American, etc. practices - but otherwise willbe suppressed as deliberately and ruthlessly associety permits. In his Aristos John Fowles observedwith glacial candor:Intelligent Athenians of the fifth centuryknew their gods were metaphors, personificationsof forces and principles. There are many signs thatthe athenianization of Christianity has begun.The second coming of Christ will be therealization that Jesus of Nazareth was supremelyhuman, not supremely divine; but this will be torelegate him to the ranks of the philosophers andto reduce the vast apparatus of ritual, church, andpriesthood to an empty shell.The Christian churches, contrary to thephilosophy of Jesus himself, have frequently madetheir own continuance their chief preoccupation.They have fostered poverty, or indifference to it;they have forced people to look beyond life; theyhave abused the childish concept of hell and hell-fire; they have supported reactionary temporalpowers; they have condemned countless innocentpleasures and bred centuries of bigotry; they haveset themselves up as refuges and too often takengood care that outside their doors refuge shall beneeded.Things are better now; but we have notforgotten that things were not better until historypresented the churches with a clear choice: reformor die. 962. AtheismAs the record of El is mythological - the fablesof the J/C Holy Bible - all the atheist need do isdismiss that document as superstitious fiction to96 Fowles, John, The Aristos. Boston: Little, Brown, 1964,extracts from Chapter 7/Christianity.- 179 -prove his point: El is nothing more than an oldfairytale.The problem here, however, is that the atheistis all too anxious to limit the question to mereacceptance/rejection of Biblical mythology. He doesnot demand that his position also stand the test ofother conventional religions, like those of Asia orNative America. That is too much trouble, and itjeopardizes the simple smugness he enjoys with hisAbrahamic coup de grace.In academia the term “scholasticism” refers toreasoning deliberately towards the support of apredetermined conclusion. Facts are acknowledgedand accepted only if they support the argument, andignored or denounced if they do not.Scholasticism became [in]famous duringmedieval and Renaissance times for the J/C-supporting “learned” arguments of Christians suchas Augustine and Aquinas (both duly sanctioned byCatholic canonization).Theoreticians not feeling the necessity tosupport “scripture” were not so honored: NiccolóMachiavelli’s name was given to the Devil as “OldNick”, and Galileo was forced to deny his science toremain alive.Today one still searches in vain for a professedatheist who has announced his position only after anon-scholasticisic search through all possible doorsto the truth. It is precisely this precariousness whichmakes their proclaimed confidence so brittle - andwhy they often react to challenges perfunctorily.3. AgnosticismThe J/C agnostic doesn’t assert the convictionof the atheist - generally because of laziness. He is a- 180 -procrastinator who would rather not risk a wrongdecision - or the antagonisms following anydecision. “Kick the can” and change the subject!C. Satanimal1.SatanismIn 1966 the Church of Satan got off to asomewhat uncertain start, and this was echoed inthe original Satanic Bible as well.The problem was that as religious metaphysicsseemed the de facto domain of institutional faiths,the ostensible opposition to it defaulted to thephysical position.As the Satanic religion was oriented towardshuman affairs rather than laboratory science, theeuphemism settled upon was “carnality”.So in this context Indulgence meant just beinga “happy animal”, luxuriating contentedly in allthose pleasurable “Seven Deadly Sins”.After a few years of Eyes Wide Shut frolics,however, Satanists noticed that somethingimportant was missing. The Satanist, in studyingand practicing both Lesser and Greater Black Magic,assumes the prerogatives and powers of a god: thatis to say the “knowledge of Good & Evil” as acquiredby Adam & Eve.But unlike those unfortunate slaves and theirprogeny, the Satanist does not suppress thisknowledge or accept guilt and punishment forpossessing and asserting it. Rather he glories in itand seeks to expand ad improve his exercise of it.This is, obviously, Indulgence in the far moreexalted sense of the Diabolicon.- 181 -2. NonRedemptionIn “Might is Right” and the second original“Lucifer” essay, a need for “redemption” wasacknowledged, with the Satanic caveat being theassumption of self-, rather than Jesus/Mohammed-redemption.The implication seemed to be that althoughsins remain sins, the Satanist reserves the right tojudge himself, including preemptive pardon. “I can’tbe sanctimonious like other priests and ministers,”sorrowfully admitted Anton LaVey in Satanis. 97Then he grinned: “But I can do anything I want!”With time and experience this license wasrealized to be inadequate if only hedonistic.Assuming the prerogative to define Good & Evilclearly carried with it the responsibility to do soconscientiously.Before too long the Church of Satan found itselfin the ironic, almost comic position of being thechampion of the highest possible concept ofmorality. Now its contrast to conventional religionhighlighted their insincerity, hypocrisy, and cold-blooded callousness to the point of torture, murder,g e n o c i d e . N o s u c h d e p r a v i t y w o u l d b ecountenanced in a Satanist! In 1972 Anton said inthe Church’s Cloven Hoof newsletter:Other religions have had thousands of yearsto construct a wall of righteous immunity withwhich to surround themselves, though they havefought, one against the other.Their priests can nefariously use theirprestigious positions, for, even though their deceitis visible, so are the deceits of those who are97 Satanis, the Devil’s Mass. 1970. DVD: “Something WeirdVideo” #ID1615SWDVD.- 182 -empowered to criticize them. Hence nothing issaid. Our Priests’ shortcomings will also bevisible, but many voices will be raised in criticism,for such criticism is justified when it attacks theDevil. Our Priests must be superior humanbeings.To attack our detractors is easy. Any Satanistwill find them to be small and unfair game; he willreceive no trophies upon bagging the limit. Suchsport can be entered into by the most fledglingSatanist, armed with a modicum of logic and apantheon of Satanic deities from which to draw, ina tournament of fantasy.The Priest of Mendes, however, is a lion inthe path of those whose only justification for livingrests on their adherence to the side of “goodness”.The Satanic Priest will be observed in allaspects of his “evilness”, whether it be a pick of thenose or an unmown lawn.Our Priests and Priestesses - like Cæsar’swife - can do no wrong.The Priesthood of the Church of Satanrequires far more perfection of its candidates thando the priesthoods of other religions, for the Priestor Priestess of Satan is the foundation of modernSatanism.As we grow, there is less room for marginalpersons within the Church. As we progress,standards of leadership are tightened - not onlybecause we become a brighter object of scrutiny,but because of increasingly higher qualificationspossessed by new members. 98The pleasures of Indulgence thus transitionedfrom nonchalant hedonism to the sophisticatedEpicureanism of the ancient Hellenistic cosmopolis:the supreme pleasure to result from the wisestGood: what Plato had sought through the dialecticof his Dialogues.98 LaVey, Anton in The Cloven Hoof, March 1972.- 183 -It was important to Plato that virtue be raisedto a level of rationality. It was not enough forpeople to be unconsciously or instinctively virtuous;they must “taste of the knowledge of good and evil”and then knowingly choose the good.Plato stratified thought as Eikasia (primitiveemotion), Pistis (ordinary active/reactive thinking),Dianoia (precise, logical, enlightened thought), andNœsis (intuition and apprehension of the Agathon):In classical political thought there was aconcern to locate authority beyond anything thatanyone could appropriate, either in wisdom or injustice, or, as in the Platonic Agathon - thesupreme Good which is beyond definition.The Agathon can accommodate as manyformulations as there are human beings, and everyperson can make his own report.As there will always be a transcending orconceivable Good beyond the good(s) of particularindividuals, the Agathon is ineffable andindefinable, and necessarily transcends the spatialand the temporal limits of finite powers ofperception.99To be a god, then, carries with it theresponsibility of wisdom, of ethics, of serving theHoly Grail that is the Agathon. It need hardly benoted that El and his entourage failed in all of thisatrociously, shockingly, disgracefully.So if you take upon yourself the name, dignity,and legacy of the Prince of Darkness, you will see inyour Xeper, your telos, a divinity breathtaking in itsmagnificence. But once you drink from this Grail,there is no turning back.99 Iyer, Raghavan N., ParaPolitics: Toward the City of Man.New York: Oxford University Press, 1979, page #22.- 184 -3. Telosa. SymboliqueTelos (from the Greek τέλος for “end”,“purpose”, or “goal”) originates in EgyptianSymbolism100 as the principle that the design andorganization of an object, a life-form, or a processinherently requires preconception based onpurpose.Conventional academic doctrine is that livingbeings’ purpose is selectively the result ofenvironmental survival needs: Darwinian “naturalselection”: There is no inherent purpose to life-forms beyond passive/reactive survival, avoidance ofpain, seeking of pleasure, and instinct to reproduce.b. Lamarck101Prior to Darwin’s theory of passive naturalselection, the French biologist Jean BaptisteLamarck (1744-1829), while not denying suchpassive evolution, augmented it with what hetermed “soft evolution” (in modern parlance“Lamarckism”). Under this theory, characteristicsdeveloped or acquired by a given living being can beinherited by its progeny, thus adding the element ofintentional purpose to evolution.100 Plutarch: “First I want to interpret for you the theology ofthe Egyptians. Through symbols they reveal certain mysticalideas that are hidden and invisible, just as nature in itsperceptible forms has to a certain extent expressed withsymbols the invisible reasons for things.” - Schwaller deLubicz, Isha, Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate. New York: InnerTraditions, 1967, page #271.101 Anton LaVey was an emphatic and unshakable Lamarckian.- 185 -If Lamarckism is allowed to operate accordingto human intellectual will, of course, then theprinciple of purpose on the individual human scaleis established. This in turn suggests that there maybe a greater element of purpose above and beyondthe individual: one or more neteru who manifestthrough that individual, both physically andconsciously.While outrageously heretical to the Darwinianestablishment, which is rigidly deistic if not outrightatheistic, such a master-principle of purpose wasneither unknown nor repugnant to the ancients,who by the time it had reached Greece from Egyptreferred to it as telos.c.TeleologyTeleology is the doctrine that final causes ofphenomena exist. Further that purpose and designare a part of or are apparent in nature. Further thatphenomena are not only guided by mechanicalforces (e.g. passive natural selection), but also movetowards certain goals of self-realization.d. MechanismThe opposite of teleology is mechanism,which describes phenomena in terms of prior causesinstead of their presumed destination or fulfillment.[Modern science is thus mechanistic.]- 186 -[index-187_1.jpg]- 187 -13: MetacarnationA. Consciousness1.Metaphysics:Consciousness as an EntityS i n c e c o n v e n t i o n a l t h e o l o g y r e g a r d sconsciousness as “the soul in action”, it hasgenerally been happy to just blur the two conceptsinto a single, nothing-further-needed axiom ofreligious faith.Philosophers seeking to escape the label ofsuch mere faith found that the moment they strayedfrom the simple act of self-awareness, they wereactually addressing other issues, such as whetherphysical sensory input is/was occurring, whethersuch input is reliable, and indeed whether themental processing of concepts and information (e.g.“thought”) should somehow be either a requirementor evidence of awareness. René Descartes’ famous“cogito ergo sum” (= I think, therefore I am) is anexample of such off-the-mark confusion; argumentsboth pro and con this maxim have all focused on theact of thinking rather than mere self-awareness.- 188 -2. Physics:Consciousness as an IllusionModern physical science remains adamantlymaterialistic; any hint of a metaphysical presence oractivity is tantamount to heresy. If consciousnessexists, therefore, it must be explainable [away] asthe physical brain generating some form of illusoryself-imagery.In support of this theory, scientists note that ifthe brain is anæsthetized, the individual “blacksout”. Also when the body and brain sleep,consciousness either blacks out or becomes merely aspectator to hallucination (e.g. dreaming).Upon examination both of these scientificclaims fail to be conclusive.As ordinary consciousness is accustomed tobeing reactive to physical sensory input, the suddenmuting of all such input by anæsthesia throws theconsciousness into a sudden non-sensory mode withwhich it has no experience. The result is temporaryinactivity, though below the level of sensory imageryit continues to receive stimulus signals from thephysical body.In certain anæsthesia applications, moreover,the body’s transmissions to the consciousness aremuted while that consciousness remains alert andcommunicative. If it were merely a function of thebody’s normal physical sensory processes, thiswould not occur.Where sleep and dreaming are concerned, ithas already been established that the quality andcoherence of the act of thinking is an entirelydifferent concern than self-awareness per se.Where ordinary sleep and dreaming areconcerned, once again awareness must not be- 189 -confused with thinking. In short, the randomimagination characteristic of dreams, or the absenceof such experiences if the resting brain has solowered its sensory transmissions, has no relevanceto awareness. Being self-aware does not require thisto be continuous.3. Consciousness/Brain DistinctionWhether the conscious/“soul” (EgyptianMindStar) is distinguishable from the physical brainis related to the constitution of bodily “death”, whichis itself not all that simple to determine.In 1981 a Commissioners’ Conference onUnites States Laws proposed a model state lawentitled the Uniform Determination of Death Act,since adopted by some but not all states. It reads:An individual who has sustained either (1)irreversible cessation of circulatory andrespiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessationof all functions of the entire brain, including thebrain stem, is dead. A determination of death mustbe made in accordance with accepted medicalstandards.This suffices in the OU to discard bodies nolonger collectively-metabolizing, but it is anunsubstantiated overreach of OU materialism toclaim that the absence of brain-electricity proves theobliteration of the mind/consciousness - which is- 190 -constitutionally an external field 102 , not a brain-internal electrochemical process.The Egyptians investigated not only theThought-Field of the MindStar (hereinafter “MS”)but its eightfold composition through anamnesis,but that’s not needed to dispel the brain-materialismmyth. For instance:1. Brain activity isn’t the same as thinking, feeling,or seeing.2. No one has remotely shown how moleculesacquire the qualities of the mind.3. It is impossible to construct a theory of the mindbased on material objects that somehow becameconscious.4. When the brain lights up, its activity is like a radiolighting up when music is played. It is an obviousfallacy to say that the radio composed the music.What is being viewed is only a physicalcorrelation, not a cause. 103The “soul” thus not really being all that difficultto discover and distinguish, it is somewhatsurprising how little attention conventional religionhas devoted to it, as now reviewed:102 Cf. MindStar & MindWar for a detailed discussion of Life-& Thought-Fields - again too extensive for this book. Forinstance physical sensory & body-functional mechanisms canbe traced to specific sections of the brain, but thoughts andmemories cannot be localized, nor measured in terms of accessspeed/complexity.103 Deepak Chopra, M.D., FACP, and Dr. Rudolph E. Tanzi,Ph.D., Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy, Professor of Neurology,Harvard Medical School Director, Genetics and Aging atMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH), “Good News: You AreNot Your Brain”, The Huffington Post, May 27, 2012.- 191 -B. Judæo/Christian SoulFrom Webster’s International Dictionary:soul:(1) The immaterial essence or substance,animating principle, or actuating cause oflife or of the individual life.(2a) The psychical or spiritual principle ingeneral shared by or embodied inindividual human beings or all beingshaving a rational and spiritual nature.(2b) The psychical or spiritual nature of theuniverse related to the physical world asthe human soul to the human body ...While a superficially-impressive attempt, thisdefinition finally falls back on empty circularity.What is an “animating principle”, and would thesoul not exist if it did not animate externalities?What is meant by “psychical” and “spiritual”? AsRobert Anton Wilson quipped in Schrödinger’s Cat:Theology was a system for explaining thingsby coining words which nobody could understandand then pretending that the words meantsomething. 104"},{"pageContent":"The Hebrews drew no distinction betweenhuman souls and the animating force common to allanimals ( nephesh). Although some part of this forcewas thought to survive the destruction of the body, itwas regarded with superstitious terror and referredto ambiguously by the terms elohim and rephaim.These shades drift forever in El’s [Mesopotamian]104 Wilson, Robert Anton, Schrödinger’s Cat. New York: PocketBooks, 1979, page #98.- 192 -underworld of Kur-nu-gi-a or Sheol, a dim, dismalprison.As the dictionary definition implies, there hasbeen relatively little Christian examination of the“soul” beyond the Jewish model. There have beensome notable artistic speculations as to what aChristian Heaven or Hell might look like, perMichelangelo, Bosch, Blake, Goya - but “souls” justappear as humans, whether redeemed or roasted.One is tempted to conclude from thissurprising absence of depiction or even curiositythat post-Enlightenment Christians, and probablyJews, don’t seriously believe in their own mythsanymore - and upon death expect nothing but theBig Black Sack of oblivion.Indeed this supposition goes a long way towardexplaining the conspicuous breakdown of traditionalmorality in modern Judæo/Christian cultures. If noone really believes in posthumous judgment andaccountability anymore, there is no reason exceptthe rather tenuous motive of “self-respect” to behave“morally” - assuming that all individuals andcommunities can even agree upon that concept.The result is a climate of anything-goesopportunism and licentiousness - not at all thereasoned Indulgence advocated by Anton LaVey in1966, but a brattishly vulgar descent to itch/scratchcarelessness and gratification-tantrums.In Walt Disney’s Pinocchio (1940) a mysteriouscoachman entices delinquent boys (including thenaïve puppet) to an anarchic “Pleasure Island”,wherein they can rampage like jackasses ... untilthey discover that, like Odysseus’ crew bewitched byCirce, they have become actual donkeys, to be soldinto a life of slavery and humiliation.Look around; notice all the ears and tails.- 193 -C. Egyptian MindStarThis is necessarily an introduction and asummary. A detailed explanation requires a book initself. 105One of the more interesting secrets of Satanismis that bodily “death” does not mean personalo b l i t e r a t i o n , b u t s i m p l y t h e M S T - F i e l drelinquishing of a no-longer-needed OU sensoryinterface.But also as previously discussed herein, thisdisconnection does not precipitate a posthumous“redemption/judgment/consequences scenario. It israther “a first step into a larger universe”, or moreprecisely, any number of them.The Egyptians discovered that, unlike theHebraic “amœbic lump of nephesh”, the MSmanifests itself in one or more of eightconcentrations or “emanations”.It is important to understand that this is not an“armchair” list, but the presentation of a box of toolsfor you to identify in your own self: familiarize,activate, extend, Xeper.Each emanation proceeds from the [more] OU-linked to the [more] SU-linked. Predictably thismakes the more basic ones that much easier toidentify based on their familiar, if subconscious OU-usage.The Egyptian priesthoods knew that each livingcreature possesses several existence-emanationsabove and beyond the metabolic mind/body.All sentient beings possess the first four ( khat,ren, khabit, ab).105 Aquino, Michael A., MindStar. San Francisco: Barony ofRachane, 2nd Edition, 2018.- 194 -Beings endowed with the Gift of Set (awarenessof isolate self-consciousness) the next two ( ba, ka)as well as in those of initiatory capacity andattainment the next one ( sekhem), and in uniqueinstances the ultimate one ( akh).Upon being alerted to each emanation, simplyredirect your thought “inward” until you find andrecognize it in yourself. You may be surprised at howeffortless this is. [As effortless and self-evident,indeed, as all of the “great truths” presented in“Lucifer”, each of which you find, perhaps to yoursurprise, that you “know already”. Welcome toanamnesis.]The MS is a gateway, a map to your personalGrail Castle. Once you know that it exists and isthere to be quested and found, you have only toenter freely and of your own will.1.KhatThe body-emanation. The khat is integralwith the being’s physical body, and is the original ofwhat later, lesser cultures would represent as the“energy body”, “body of light”, “astral body”, etc. Incurrent field theory it constitutes the life-field of theperson, controlling and directing its materialcounterpart’s organization, regeneration, and spanof existence. During physical life it is coextensivewith its material counterpart. After material death itmay remain with the corpse to serve as a mediumfor the other emanations, or it may merely lingernear its remains. Jungians perceived the khat as the“earthbound” anima, and in the oriental vision ofthe Golden Flower it was known as the kuei:Tao the undivided, Great One, gives rise totwo opposite reality principles, Darkness and- 195 -Light, yin and yang. These are at first thought ofonly as forces of nature apart from man. Later thesexual polarities, and others as well, are derivedfrom them. From yin comes K’un, the receptivefeminine principle; from yang comes Ch’ien, thecreative masculine principle. From yin comesming (life); from yang comes hsing (essence).Each individual contains a central monadwhich, at the moment of conception, splits into lifeand essence ( ming and hsing). These two aresuper-individual principles and so can be relatedto eros and logos.In the personal bodily existence of theindividual they are represented by two otherpolarities, a p’o soul (or anima) and a hun soul (oranimus). All during the life of the individual thesetwo are in conflict, each striving for mastery. Atdeath they separate and go different ways. Theanima sinks to earth as kuei, a ghost-being. 106It is the khat which is drawn into or activatedfrom within a corpse in necromantic magicalworkings. As the reader may surmise, the khat isalso the vehicle for the zombie practices ofVoodoo. 107106 The Secret of the Golden Flower by Richard Wilhelm(Trans) (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1931. A classicof Chinese Taoism describing the process of the attainment oftranscendental existence by the means of creating a mandalafrom the personal subconscious. A key influence in the magicalphilosophy of Golden Dawn Rosicrucian W.B. Yeats. Cf. also amore recent translation by Thomas Cleary (San Francisco:HarperSan Francisco, 1991).107 For details of zombification see Wade E. Davis , The Serpentand the Rainbow (New York: Warner Books, 1987), concerningHaitian Voodoo and actual zombie creation - not bysupernatural means, but by the secret use of poisons. The bookis based upon field research by the author, who holdsundergraduate degrees from Harvard University inEthnobotany and Biology, and a Ph.D. in Ethnobotany.- 196 -2. RenThe name-emanation. The Egyptiansunderstood the power of names to identify, define,protect, and empower individuals - mostconspicuously in the various names taken by eachpharaoh. Collectively and separately each nameaffected the very essence of the person, and thegreatest curse [as also illustrated in literature andfilm] was to be denied all names. 108 Externally aname can be used to summon or compel, whetherphysically incarnate or not. The neteru also have thepower and the discretion to give names as well astake them, and through such names to take formand voice.3. KhabitThe shadow-emanation. This is theconnection of the still-incarnate khat with the life-forces of the natural neteru, enabling it to functionas the organizing and controlling energy (theindividual “life-field”). If the khabit is destroyed, thelife-field de-energizes and the physical body expires.108 For example, in Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars,the Egyptian priests who sought to prevent the fearedsorceress-Queen Tera from returning to incarnate lifeattempted to destroy all inscriptions of her name in her tomb,as well as in other references to her. [They failed.]In H.P. Lovecraft’s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, thename and all references to the Colonial sorcerer JosephCurwen were tracked down and obliterated by the vigilanteswho murdered him.Elsewhere in exoteric history it was a common practice forEgyptian pharaohs and priesthoods to attempt to deface orerase the names, images, and monuments of feared or hatedpredecessors, such as the “heretic” Akhenaten.- 197 -In Black Magic the khabit can also be sent out by itsowner as an instrument of influence upon others.After the physical body is destroyed or nolonger needed, the khabit becomes an avatar of theneter Anubis, overseeing guidance of the[noninitiate] consciousness through the incoherenceof the Tuat into the stabilization of Amenti. Aninitiated consciousness needs no such guidance.4. AbThe heart-emanation. The physical locus ofindividual identity and consciousness, hence thebridge between the OU of the neteru and the SU ofthe four metaphysical emanations. It is through theab that an individual realizes and recognizesincarnate identity and uniqueness, and followingdestruction/expiration of one’s body it is throughthe ab that one can reenter the OU [as a “ghost”,through “possession” (more precisely merger withanother, incarnate ab), or through thought-transference].It is also in the ab that the strength and qualityof one’s maat (inclination to “good” or “evil”)reposes. This is echoed in the later Indianmythologies of karma, and was the reason for theposthumous “weighing of the heart against afeather” in Egypt. After bodily death the maatwithin the ab overwhelms it completely, so that anysubsequent manifestation in the OU is likely to bean extreme concentration of either beneficence ormalevolence.- 198 -5. BaThe core-emanation. This is each sentientbeing’s sense of self-awareness, of unique andabsolute distinction from everything else (both othersentient beings and the entire OU). Thus it is themanifestation, or Gift, of Set, the neter of non-nature, in each so-conscious entity.The ba becomes stronger through increasedself-exploration and -realization: the initiatoryprocess of Xeper. Unlike natural initiation, whichdraws the individual into alignment, harmony, andultimately conscious absorption into andindistinction from one or more of the naturalneteru, Xeper of the ba does not dissolve the selfinto Set, but attains and sustains a cohesive essenceof its own.The anamnesis or “remembered knowledge”experienced by the slave boy in Plato’s Meno isperhaps more accurately described as the physical-process, stimulus/response brain reaching in to theba for bits of its immortal, eternal wisdom. But thisis akin to reaching for a coal in a hot fire. It isstressful to do, and the result can be held only for afleeting moment without further stress. Thesuperficial/physical “self”, which through material“hits” continuously reassures itself that it is the onlyself, is shaken by exposure to its falseness, itsnothingness. It backs away from such “closeencounters”, dismisses them as “illusions”,“fantasy”, “imagination”, etc., and hastens to rebuildits fortress of material-sensation walls.Absent Setian orientation and initiation, a basimply continues as one’s sense of identity, thus the“essential self” around which all of the other soulscoalesce and recognize themselves. Within- 199 -noninitiates this results in the ba being sensed as adreamy, meditative “state of being” which, ifindulged in with persistence and intensity, leads toits overwhelming the other souls, hence “nirvana”and similar states of ba-ecstasy.6. KaThe transmigration-emanation. The ka isthe complete mirror-image of all eight natural andnon-natural emanations, fused into an avatar,Doppelgänger, or Horla, a completely metaphysicalremanifestation of oneself which can exist anddisplace without limit, both within the non-naturaluniverse generated by one’s ba and within thephysical universe of the natural neteru as well.It is the ka that, through the ab, enters thenatural universe through “identity gates” such aspictures or statues of the individual, or utterance ofthe individual’s name(s) (the ren), as well asthrough conducive locales such as temples andgeological & architectural anomalies.While the ba may, particularly posthumously,lose awareness of itself through the paradoxicalexpansion of that consciousness into its entireperceptive field, the ka remains immortally finite,distinct, and otherness-separate. Thus in anexpressive, active sense it becomes the externally-identifiable individual beyond physical death.Nowhere is the ka better illustrated than ininitiate Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars.Film treatments of this work, such as Hammer’sBlood from the Mummy’s Tomb and the morerecent The Awakening, have done it a grotesquedisservice. In Stoker’s original text it is in no sense ahorror story, but rather a fascinating and romantic- 200 -mystery: Who was Tera of ancient Egypt, thismarvelous sorceress-queen who took with her to hertomb only a ruby scarab inscribed with theconstellation of the Thigh of Set (our “Great Bear”)and the hieroglyphs mer (love) and men ab(patience)? Listen to the words of the woman of ourown era with whose ka Tera came gently to merge:I can see her in her loneliness and in thesilence of her mighty pride, dreaming her owndream of things far different from those aroundher. Of some other land, far away under thecanopy of the silent night, lit by the cool, beautifullight of the stars. A land under that Northern star,whence blew the sweet winds that cooled thefeverish desert air. A land of wholesome greenery,far, far away. Where were no scheming andmalignant priesthood; whose ideas were to lead topower through gloomy temples and more gloomycaverns of the dead, through an endless ritual ofdeath! A land where love was not base, but a divinepossession of the soul! Where there might be someone kindred spirit which could speak to hersthrough mortal lips like her own; whose beingcould merge with hers in a sweet communion ofsoul to soul, even as their breaths could mingle inthe ambient air! I know the feeling, for I haveshared it myself. I may speak of it now, since theblessing has come into my own life. I may speak ofit since it enables me to interpret the feelings, thevery longing soul, of that sweet and lovely Queen,so different from her surroundings, so high aboveher time! Whose nature, put into a word, couldcontrol the forces of the Under World; and thename of whose aspiration, though but graven on astar-lit jewel, could command all the powers in thePantheon of the High Gods. And in the realisationof that dream she will surely be content to rest!In Love and Patience we are taught the secretof true immortality - not the repulsive reanimationof corpses ( anastasis nekron) of Christianity, northe vague confusion of reincarnationists - but the- 201 -infinite radiance of one’s MS by its most magnificentexpression, and with a serene transcendence ofnatural time.The last two emanations are unique in thatthey must arise from the individual, and requireinitiate consciousness to do so, per the formulaXepera Xeper Xeperu (“I Have Come Into Being andCreated That Which Has Come Into Being.”).7. SekhemThe neter-emanation. While the termsekhem is ordinarily translated as “power”, this ismisleading, because it is power in a very rarifiedsense - that emanating from the neteru themselves.For this reason it is also described as “the power ofthe stars” through which the neteru manifest in thenatural universe. The sekhem combines with the ab(as, in effect, a temple within one’s consciousness),to draw down the essence of one or more adoredneteru to indwell therein.Activation of the sekhem has another effect:every incidence infuses the Initiate with more of theneter invoked, to the cumulative degree that theInitiate’s personality becomes accented by theneter’s: seeing as that neter sees, speaking as thatneter would speak, acting as that neter would act.Hence it is the sekhem which makes possible, andultimately consecrates priesthood of a neter in theindividual so aligned. Once this transformation hastaken place, it cannot be undone; at most it may besublimated or repressed, but only at great cost to thepriest’s or priestess’ very sanity.- 202 -8. AkhThe star-emanation. Beyond the priesthoodof the sekhem is the akh, in which the Initiate risesto the company of the neteru as one of their essence,i f n o t o f t h e m a b s o l u t e l y . S u c h o n e i sindistinguishable from the actual neteru except bythe neteru themselves. Such a mode of existencedeparts completely from all concern with physicaldisplacement within natural-universal references orboundaries, manifestation, or action, and affectsotherness only by the radiance of its presence. Whileit does not destroy any of the other emanations, itpermeates all of them, such that henceforth they allexist in conformity and concert with it.[index-203_1.jpg]- 203 -IIIBelialGloria Terrae- 204 -[index-205_1.jpg]- 205 -“Of a Neophyte, and How the Black Art WasRevealed unto Him by the Fiend Asmoel”- Aubrey Beardsley, 1893- 206 -[index-207_1.jpg]- 207 -14: MagicA. The MagicianIt is the curse and the blessing of humanity toexist simultaneously in two worlds: that of thetangible real and that of the intangible ethereal.Unlike all other animals we are not contentwith physical life’s sensations; despite soberargument and methodical science we never quitebelieve that “this is all there is” to our existence. Weare drawn, some gently, as in fantasy and dream,some more insistently and passionately, to -something else, something greater, something thatlifts our being and our significance clear out ofnature, far beyond the realms of atoms andmolecules: an magnificent mælstrom of gods anddaemons for whom “reality” is but a poor crutch forbrutes on the periphery of their much largeruniverse.If the mystic is content to dream about thisother universe and the artist to convey glimpses of itin music, paint, or pen, it is the passion of themagician to interact with it. The magician seeks todraw its presence and power into the lesser world, tochange that world by its touch.- 208 -The magician fumbles at this. There are noordinary tools Here that he can reliably apply There,and the great rays of the gods that flow so inexorablyand thrillingly through “nature” are just as elusive.They are to be glimpsed out of the corner of one’seye, unexpectedly. The magician struggles to fashionnew and different tools for control which he, in hissemblance as sentient, natural man-beast, can usereliably and repeatedly, as one would a wrench orhammer.To non-magicians his efforts may appearbewildering, even foolish. They are illogical. Theydon’t make sense. They are but “melted into thinair”. Perhaps they are even harmful in that theyentice others into the same useless folly, drainingenergy which might better be put to serious,practical labor. The magician may thus find himselfignored as an irrelevant eccentric, perhaps evenostracized as someone dangerously insane.Yet he continues with his great work, his searchfor tools. Sometimes he thinks he has indeed foundor fashioned just such a different kind of wrench orhammer, and he writes down descriptions of it andinstructions for its use. Sometimes other magicians,in their quest for tools, come across what he haswritten and try his ideas for themselves. Andsometimes they indeed seem to work, and soanother brick has been added to the bridge betweenHere and There. Let us now examine, and perhapsventure out upon that bridge.The Temple of Set defines magic according totwo general categories: White and Black. Thesehave precise meanings which may quite differentfrom the way the terms are casually used bynonSetians. To begin with, neither category isinherently “good” or “evil”; the categories- 209 -encompass techniques only. Either may be used forintentionally or unintentionally beneficial orharmful purposes.B. DefinitionIndividual humans find themselves juxtaposedto the Objective Universe (OU) as created andNatural Law (NL)-ordered by the neteru, and avariable number of Subjective Universes (SU)created by oneself and/or other discrete intellects.Magic consists of the language and tools bywhich an individual renders either type of universeintelligible and is thus able to methodically interactwith and influence it.Such language & tools may be considered as acontinuum: a sliding-scale: When widely-known andgenerally-accepted [particularly pertinent to theOU], they are called “science”. The more obscureand unknown are called “magic”.As we have seen, academic science seeks todiscover and codify the “how” of NL science; itregards the “why” as undiscoverable because it ismetaphysical.Religions are such because they propose tounderstand and explain metaphysics. And as wehave also seen, all but the Satanic/Setian do soineffectively, on the basis of baseless myths andvague, tautological argument. Their magic thusamounts to more- or less-elaborate self-deception,and is herein defined as White Magic (WM).Actual, functional magic prerequires therealization and acceptance of the individual as anentity and discrete intelligence external to OU & SU;a D5 being. It is this premise which bothmaterialism and conventional religion fear to- 210 -acknowledge or accept. This is the true reason theyboth fear “5D language & tools”, which they [andwe] call Black Magic (BM). The difference,obviously, is that Black Magicians do not fear them,and indeed actively pursue and apply them.Also different from popular superstition andstereotype: There is no morality inherent ineither WM or BM. They are tools only, and anymoral values, motives, decisions come from the userof the tool, not the tool itself. So WM can be usednefariously and BM benignly. [Morality & ethics inmagic are treated in detail later.]It is axiomatic in conventional religions thatthe OU as created and ordered by El reflects hisprejudices, e.g. “morality”. Therefore WM is goodand acceptable insofar as it panders to El and doesnot insult him. Religious-ritualized WM isaccordingly called “prayer”, along with ceremonieswhich glorify the supposed moral aspect of El.Accordingly WM is useful only within the limitsof prayer and glorification. Anything beyond thatwould be an insult to, a usurpation of El and thusblasphemy.As you’ve probably figured out by now, theSatanic Bible’s purpose is first to explain the reality,the actuality of the OU/SU environments and thephenomenon & distinction of independenthumanity, which was done in “Lucifer”.This next section, “Belial”, is an introduction toBM and its application. Assuming, in other words,that you now understand what Satanism really is,this is where you learn what you can do with it.- 211 -C. Universal Language1.ObjectiveThe structure and mechanisms - NL - of the OUare omnipresent and immutable. Thus NL need onlybe discovered, established through repetition (the“laboratory method”), codified, and used: science.Appropriately the language of science is fixed,structured, sufficiently tied to OU phenomena that itshares their phenomenological consistency andreliability: mathematics, chemistry, physics, etc.Non-scientific language can be and is used todialogue and speculate concerning the OU. In“respectable, academicing” settings, however, effortis made not to venture far afield from known,scientific laws and theories accepted as laws.2. SubjectiveTo the extent that SUs are constructedreasonably and rationally, the tools of science andthe language of logic can be applied therein as well,somewhat less reliably than in the OU, of course.But SUs can also differ extraordinarily fromOU “reality”, and as they do, their tools andlanguage stray commensurately from science andlogic.At the imaginative and creative extreme offantasy, the language and tools depart completely aswell; now they exist in a reality of their own. This isthe realm of magic.- 212 -Defined in this specific context and application,magic is “the art and science of causing change inaccordance with will” 109.Within the completely malleable SU it isequally fluid and free, simply providing a means fordisplaying, discussing, and enjoying the creativeinfinite. Friedrich Nietzsche referred to this as “thebuilding of horizons” [beyond the known], and inthe visual arts of the Decadents, Surrealists,Expressionists, and Art Deco Modernists it finds itsvisual sensory extreme, as in literature with thepoetry of Clark Ashton Smith110 and JamesThomson111, and the prose of Lord Dunsany, EdgarAllan Poe, H. Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, BramStoker, Abraham Merritt, and H.P. Lovecraft.Dwelling and wandering amidst such purefantasia, magic is “completely at home”: an artisticand sensual interpretation and accentuation of itssurroundings. And indeed as such, no moreremarkable than an artist’s paintbrush.D. Tools1.White MagicConventional religious ritual is a device forautohypnosis of the celebrant and varying degrees ofmass-hypnosis for the audience. The mechanicalliturgies have a relaxing, dulling effect upon themind, placing it in the ( alpha-wave) mood most109 Aleister Crowley’s famous definition.110 Cf. “The Hashish-Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil”.111 Cf. “The City of Dreadful Night”.- 213 -receptive to the conditioning (i.e. the sermon orother main body of the ritual).WM is a highly-concentrated form of suchritual. The practitioner seeks a focus of hisawareness and powers of concentration via anextreme degree of autohypnosis. The technique maybe used simply for meditation or entertainmentthrough mental imagery (“astral projection”). Or itmay be used to focus the will towards a desired end -a cure, curse, etc. To accomplish this, the magicianenvisions a god or dæmon with the power to achievethe goal, then concentrates his will into an appeal.The god or dæmon then carries out the appeal, moreor less effectively - depending upon the strength ofthe magician’s conviction of its power as afunctioning entity. 112From a LHP perspective, all conventionalreligious, and RHP “occult” ritualism falls under theheading of WM. Intrinsically it is inauthentic andimpotent. Its power derives rather from what it getspeople to believe and do when it is used as apsychological individual- or mass-control device.Thus, for instance, any sort of advertising orpropaganda is an application of WM, though neitherusers nor targets may [and probably wouldn’t]employ that term.2. Black Magica. LesserLesser Black Magic (LBM) involves noautohypnosis or conditioning of the mind to make it112 Crowley, Aleister, Magick, pages #151-284. LaVey, Anton,The Satanic Bible, pages #110-152; The Satanic Rituals, pages#15-27.- 214 -receptive to induced imagery. Thus, unlike WM, it isnot an exercise in self-deception. Rather it is adeliberate and conscious effort to force the mindoutward - to identify the mix of NL governing asituation of concern, as well as the SUs of anyhumans involved, and then to devise and activateadjustments towards the magician’s desiredoutcome.As you can see, this has absolutely nothing todo with chanting Hebraic gibberish from medievalgrimoires. Leave that to White Magicians toentertain and scare themselves.So true, effective LBM is an exhaustively-analytical process - more exacting than profaneacademic research because there is no allowance fortaboos, sacred cows, or other “political correctness”.If the objective is to be realized, all factorsconstituting it must fall into place.Thus the fairytale image of LBM being an easyshortcut to a desired OU change is anything but thetruth. The reason that LBM is more powerful than“ordinary” plans or solutions is precisely because ofits thoroughness: it leaves nothing out, no marginfor error, no “fudge factor”.Nor is this as unrealistic as one might suppose.All you need do is look around you at the number ofunsolved or inadequately-solved problems, both atthe personal and the social scales, to see how easy itis to identify the flaws resulting from “selectiveinattention”.An unpalatable but inevitable corollary to LBMis what Anton LaVey called the “balance factor”,which simply means not to set practically-unattainable goals. Be a magician within yourintelligence, competence, and resources - all of- 215 -which are of course subject to strengthening withpersonal discipline and experience. 113Another popular myth is that BM is a ritualaction, in a ritual chamber. As again may bededuced from the above, ritualism is not arequirement, though, as discussed below, it mayplay an important and effective part.Remember too that in LBM you are notattempting to accomplish “miracles”, e.g. thesuspension or violation of NL. Rather you arechanging the mix of NL to change the situation ofconcern.But even more importantly, remember that it isnot the OU you are attempting to change; it is theexisting, dominant CSU. This was one of the keymessages of George Orwell’s 1984, and the one mostreaders miss.b. History, or“Reality Control”The Party said that Oceania had never beenin alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knewthat Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia asshort a time as four years ago. But where did thatknowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness,which in any case must soon be annihilated. And ifall others accepted the lie which the Party imposed- if all records told the same tale - then the liepassed into history and became truth. “Who113 Ca. 2011 I decided that I’d had enough of the epidemic ofphysical warfare afflicting the planet. I therefore developedand published the solution of MindWar (2012, 1016). Themethodology and strategy therein are practical, needing onlyresolve by national & supranational actors, which I furtheraddressed in FindFar (2017). The only indeterminant is themushrooming PhysWar time-pressure. But MW & FF wouldhave been impossible absent professional expertise in PoliticalScience, governmental political/military affairs, & LBM.- 216 -controls the past,” ran the Party slogan, “controlsthe future; who controls the present controls thepast.” And yet the past, though of its naturealterable, never had been altered. Whatever wastrue now was true from everlasting to everlasting.It was quite simple. All that was needed was anunending series of victories over your ownmemory. “Reality control” they called it; inNewspeak “doublethink”. 114“History” is something we can count on as astandard of morality, as hard evidence of truth, asbedrock amidst our whirling contemporaryenvironment of uncertainties, right?Wrong. Historical accounts are written byhuman beings with widely-varying backgrounds,perspectives, motives, and paychecks. Even givenperfect, immediate access to all information aboutan event, no two people will describe it, or itssignificance, in the same way. And in historicalresearch there is almost never access to all relevantinformation to begin with.Daniel J. Boorstin is Librarian of CongressEmeritus, and is a distinguished scholar and PulitzerPrize winner who has authored many superbhistorical analyses. In his Hidden History heproposes several laws that shape what we know as“history”:115(1) The Law of the Survival of theUnreadThere is a natural and inevitabletendency toward the destruction and114 Orwell, George, 1984.

It means that:• All of the historical sources you consult areincomplete, inaccurate, biased, and/or incompetentto some degree.•• You yourself are in the grip of tacitprejudices and presuppositions which you havenever questioned or even acknowledged as anythingto be questioned.You can compensate for these blind spots &biases by first becoming aware of them, then seekingout information & sources to evaluate them.c.Stage MagicIn both the Church of Satan & Temple of Set, Ihave always recommended “stage magic” (SM) as asuperb education & experience for aspiring BlackMagicians.You may think of SM as mere frivolousentertainment. It is anything but that: the art &science of detecting & manipulating an audience’sCSU, to the extent that they believe the OU NL tohave been “miraculously” violated. This is exactly- 220 -what LBM involves in progressively larger and moreserious situations.A d d i t i o n a l l y S M i s i n d e e d h a r m l e s sentertainment, which is fun for both magician &audience. 116 Indeed if you become skilled enough,you may even turn it into an additional paidprofession. At the very least you can expect manymore invitations to parties!What are these LBM skills that SM teaches andexercises? Here’s a list:• Either control of the environmentor adaptation of the magic to it. Onlythe simplest “table tricks” of magic can bed o n e w i t h o u t r e g a r d t o t h e i rsurroundings. For most illusions to beeffective, the complete environment inwhich they are activated must becontrolled: lighting, absence or presenceof external noise, intentional distractionsfrom close attention, audience alertnessand receptiveness. While an illusion isintended to appear spontaneous, itfrequently requires careful advancepreparation out of view of the eventualaudience.• Establishment of the magician’sdominant relationship. The magiciandisplays a persona - dress, assertivespeech, body language, pressured pace,116 Unfortunately there have been instances of SM being usedfor financial/publicity fraud, from spoon-bending to “remoteviewing”. The SM profession emphatically condemns this, itsmost famous exposer being James Randi; cf. his Flim-Flam &related investigations.- 221 -eye contact - designed to seize and holdthe attention of the audience, as well as togradually but inexorably replace theirwills and judgment of reality with his own.[This is particularly essential tohypnotism.]• D i c t a t i o n o f t h e a p p l i c a b l eelements. The magician identifies to theaudience what objects, locations, and/orprocedures are important and essential,r e s t r i c t i n g t h e p r o b l e m t o t h e i rinteraction exclusively. The consequenceof this is that an object’s behavior whichmight seem unremarkable or contrivedagainst ordinary backgrounds or points ofreference becomes surprising andinexplicable in this artificial environment.• Definition of the variables. An objector procedure may be used in any numberof ways, but the magician defines them soas to limit these ways to only those whichmake possible and reinforce the illusion.• Instruction of behavior. Audienceparticipation is desirable, since goingthrough motions to supposedly producethe illusion suggests to the audience thatit is somewhat responsible for it, thusencouraging belief in it.• Limitation of possibilities. As hecontrols all of the object(s) andprocedure(s) variables, the magician canforce the outcome of the illusion into one- 222 -w h i c h t h e e qu a l l y - p re d e t e rm i n e dalternatives appear to highlight asmiraculous.• Channeling of expectations. Once incontrol of both the elements of the illusionand the audience’s perceptions andwillpower, the magician instructs theaudience in what the possible outcomes ofthe illusion can be. It is now “impossible”for the objects or procedures to functionin any other way, nor for the audience todevise or consider one.• Interpretation of the result. Once theillusion is produced, the magician makesit clear to the audience what it “obviously”signifies. As in his initial establishment ofcontrol over the audience, he nowimplants - though announcement,emotional surprise/satisfaction, and bodyl a n g u a g e - t h e i r p r e s u m e d l y“spontaneous” reaction.• R e i n f o r c e m e n t o f c o n t r o l l e dperceptions. As necessary to establishthe performed illusion firmly in “reality”,the magician follows it up with as manys u p p o r t i n g d e v i c e s a n d c r e a t e dimpressions as are necessary.Beyond these basics LBM is particularlyconcerned with the magical discipline of- 223 -mentalism. 117 This involves diversion of audienceperceptions and interpretations towards a differentinterpretation of their own thought processes thanthe one which they would naturally experience. Thisis accomplished both through the above-listedtechniques of magic and supporting assistants and/or devices.d. GreaterLBM is a tool to examine and control the OU.Greater Black Magic (GBM) is the correspondingtool to investigate, comprehend, and control SUs.As discussed in “Lucifer”, SUs are created bythe power of each individual consciousness (MS).Even the most “uninitiated” human subconsciouslygenerates one, which he believes to be the OU; it isactually only his limited perception & interpretationof the OU.If he is sufficiently intelligent, and experiencesadequate education and/or initiation, he mayconsciously begin to replace or augment his“stimulus/response” SU with a deliberate, consciousone. At about the same point he may become awareof an sensitive to the various CSUs used toindoctrinate and control him. He may retain [or beforced to retain] some of these, while modifying orcompletely rejecting others.LBM is locked to the OU & NL, so there is littledanger of the magician’s loss of mental coherence.With GBM the risks are far greater, because theindividual is operating completely within one or117 Not to be confused with the clinical psychological orphilosophical definitions of “mentalism”.- 224 -more SUs, with the license of the Black Flame/Giftof Set to create/modify/destroy any of them at will.The initial aspect of this danger is that themagician may attempt to exercise such divineprerogatives before fully comprehending himself,e.g. discovering, exploring, and becoming fluentwith at least the first six MS emanations.The result of this can be a “blind” expansion ofthe powers of the mind, without becoming aware ofor mastering some of the most extreme, especially inthe 95% of thinking that occurs subconsciously. 118 Aremarkable, perhaps ominously prescientillustration of this danger was given in the 1956science-notsofiction movie Forbidden Planet, inwhich a human scientist used an alien machine toexpand his own mental power while unaware that itwas simultaneously doing the same to the rawemotions of his subconscious (oversimplified as theFreudian id). The result was an energy-monster overwhich he had no conscious control, and whichultimately killed him as similar ones had the alieninventors of he machine.The discipline which Plato prescribed to attainthe highest level of conscious thought, nœsis,necessary to recognize and comprehend theMindStar emanations was the process of dialectic,illustrated by the conversations in his famousDialogues. These carefully-structured discussionsexamined a topic - such as one of the OU Forms(= neteru) such as Justice (= Maat) by progressivelyeliminating vaguer, more superficial images fromeikasia to pistis and dianoia to unencumbered, purenœsis, a “purified intuition” that could then be used,118 Cf. Leonard Mlodinow, Ph.D., Subliminal: How YourUnconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior (New York: Pantheon,2012).- 225 -as in the Meno, to activate the “recollectiveapprehension of the Form, anamnesis.Use of the Platonic dialectic to attain theprecision of nœsis, followed by the activation ofanamnesis will enable the Black Magician to Xeperfrom manimal to MindStar without the risk of beingoverwhelmed by his “id-monster” along the way. 119e. AnamnesisThe key of anamnesis came down to Plato fromEgypt through Pythagoras. As Dr. Raghavan Iyersummarizes:Thus the soul, since it is immortal andhas been born many times, and has seenall things both here and in the otherworld, has learned everything that is. Sowe need not be surprised if it can recallthe knowledge of virtue or anything elsewhich, as we see, it once possessed. Allnature is akin, and the soul has learnedeverything, so that when a man hasrecalled a single piece of knowledge--learned it, in ordinary language--there isno reason why he should not find out allthe rest, if he keeps a stout heart and doesnot grow weary of the search, for seekingand learning are in fact nothing butrecollection.- Plato, Meno119 Aleister Crowley undertook just such an anamnesis asrecorded in his Liber 418: The Vision and The Voice. Heemployed the imperfect Golden Dawn text of John Dee’s XIXEnochian Key, possibly precipitating his terrifying encounterwith the “id-monster” Choronzon in the Tenth Æthyr. Crowleywas so badly shaken that he tore his manuscript of that æthyrout of Liber 418; it is a separate document in the SpecialCollections of the University of Texas.- 226 -Anamnesis is the true soul-memory,intermittent access to the divine wisdom withinevery human being as an immortal spectator. Allself-conscious monads have known overimmemorial time a vast host of subjects andobjects, modes and forms, an ever-changinguniverse. Assuming a complex series of roles asan essential part of the endless process oflearning, the soul becomes captive recurrently tomyriad forms of maya and moha, illusion anddelusion. At the same time the soul has the innateand inward capacity to cognize that is is morethan any and all of these masks. As everyincarnated being manifests a poor, pale caricatureof himself - a small, self-limiting, and invertedreflection of one’s nœtic and creative potential -the ancient doctrine of anamnesis is vital tocomprehend human nature and its hiddenpossibilities. Given the fundamental truth that allhuman beings have played many parts, initiatingdiverse actions in intertwined chains of causation,it necessarily follows that everyone has the moraland material environment from birth to deathwhich is needed for self-correction and self-education. But who is it that has this need?Not the shadowy self or false egoity whichmerely reacts to external stimuli.

Overview1.ConceptWhether White or Black, a magical ritual is acondensation. It transforms implicit ideas, motives,intentions, objectives into explicit ones.The result is both a crystallization and anactivation. It is the creation of life, as in Metropolisthe Black Magician Rotwang did for the robotrixParody, or as Baron Frankenstein did for his scienceproject. Everything that proceeds from a ritual iskinetic in that ritual.So the first thing to understand about a SatanicBlack Magical ritual is that it is never a rote exerciseor recitation. If you don’t know what you’re doing orwhy, then you’re wasting both your own time andSatan’s.The same holds true for sincerity. For a ritualto be effective, you must believe in its authority andintend that what it articulates shall manifest in theuniverse towards which it is directed. The samestandard holds for other participants or witnesses.- 228 -2. “Ta-Ra-Ra-HAM-Forash!”There are few things more pathetic andridiculous than “Satanatheists” who insist theycertainly don’t believe in Satan while standingmedallionrobed before a Baphomet wall-plaque theydon’t understand, sonorously mouthing incantationsof meaningless gibberish - the only purpose of whichdresscapade being to impress idiots who assumethat its utter incomprehensibility endows it withesoteric dignity.In Edgar Ulmer’s 1934 Art Decorative TheBlack Cat, Satanic Priest Hjalmar Poelzigcommences a Black Mass with an incantation of themost bloodfreezing blasphemy:Cum grano salis. Fortis cadere cedere non potest. Humanumest errare. Lupis pilum mutat, non mentem. Magna est veritaset praevalebit. Acta exteriora indicant interiora secreta.Aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem. Amissumquod nescitur non amittitur. Brutum fulmen. Cum grano salis.Fortis cadere cedere non potest. Fructu, non foliis arboremaestima. Insanus omnes furere credit ceteros. Quem paenitetpeccasse paene est innocens.Theater audiences, whom Ulmer and Universalassumed were likely to be no more fluent in Latinthan Catholic Church congregations, were suitably- 229 -scandalized, doubtless hastening to cover theirchildren’s ears against such a diabolical diatribe. 121Mystobabble has long been a staple of religion,and in the original Satanic Bible Anton LaVeynaughtily pranked the public with suitablesanctimoanings: The thunderous exclamation“Shemhamforash! ”, more accurately ShemHaMephorash (Hebrew: שרופמה םש) is justCabalistic122 gobbledegook for the name of El, sohardly the thing for hailing Satan. But like thesimilarly-scrambled Bessy Baphomet, it was theeffect, not the elucidation, which counted. 123Anton was similarly mischievous concerninghis Enochian Keys in “Leviathan”, as is discussed inChapter #16; but once again it was the effect, not theessence, that he sought.If you’ve been screaming “Shemhamforash!” orhurling 10th-Key Kurses for the last 50 years, don’tbe too pissed at Boris, Anton, or St. Peter; this time-dishonored device is what Aleister Crowleyelegantized as “barbarous words of evocation”:A singular and world-famous example ofthis is of sufficiently recent date to be fresh in thememory of many people now living.121 [English translation:] With a grain of salt. A brave man mayfall, but he cannot yield. To err is human. The wolf may changehis skin, but not his nature. Truth is mighty, and will prevail.External actions show internal secrets. Remember when life'spath is steep to keep your mind even. The loss that is notknown is no loss at all. Heavy thunder. With a grain of salt. Abrave man may fall, but he cannot yield. By fruit, not by leaves,judge a tree. Every madman thinks everybody mad. Whorepents from sinning is almost innocent.122 Cf. Chapter #11.A.2.e “CabalEmption”, page #154.123 The Baphomet is discussed in Appendix #4.- 230 -At a revivalist camp meeting in the “United”States of America, devotees were worked up tosuch a pitch of excitement that the whole assemblydeveloped a furious form of hysteria.The comparatively intelligible cries of“Glory!” and “Hallelujah!” no longer expressed thesituation. Somebody screamed out “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!”, and this was taken up by the wholemeeting and yelled continuously until reaction setin.The affair got into the papers, and someparticularly bright disciple of John Stuart Mill,logician and economist, thought that these words,having set one set of fools crazy, might do thesame to all the other fools in the world. Heaccordingly wrote a song, and produced thedesired result.This is the most notorious example in recenttimes of the power exerted by a barbarous name ofevocation.124In short: A BNoE, if spoken [or whispered orshrieked] with purpose and sincerity will haveexactly the result the magician intends; it is the will,not the diction, that is crucial.Correspondingly the most perfectly-recitedtext, if insincere, is merely a waste of oxygen.3. ClassificationThere are two general types of rituals:ceremonies and workings.a. CeremoniesA ceremony is a pageant for the participantsand audience if any. It is designed as a story,illustration, commemoration, celebration, or lesson.124 Crowley, Aleister, “Magick in Theory & Practice” in Magick.New York: Samuel Weiser, 1994.- 231 -All of the rituals in Anton LaVey’s SatanicRituals are ceremonies, including my twoLovecraftian ones. The sole exception is the BlackMass ( Missa Solemnis), about which more below.As in the SR & COS examples, a ceremony maybe wholly or partially scripted; it is an artistic &philosophical illustration, which does not seek tocommunicate with Satan or other Powers ofDarkness [beyond inviting therm to enjoy the show].If you are considering inviting nonSatanistguests to observe a ritual, make it a ceremony, not aworking. Let them know beforehand the ceremony’stheme. In principle they should not attend unlessthey think they will be comfortable with it, but ifthey find out that they are not, advise them that theyare free to leave unobtrusively.Sometimes “unobtrusively” can add flavor tothe ceremony. In 1972 our Nineveh Grotto inKentucky decided to recreate one of John Dee’snecromancies (raising of the dead), using hisoriginal spells. A professor from the LouisvilleTheological Seminary learned about it and asked ifhe could attend with some students. We were alwayshappy to do our part for interfaith cordiality.For the ceremony one of the Grotto’s mostpetite ladies was professionally corpse-madeup andclad in a white coffin-dress straight out of HammerFilms.When professor & students entered thedarkened chamber, the flickering candlelightoutlined this still, ghastly shape atop the altar [indecidedly less-pleasant place of the usual “livingaltar”].Dr. Dee’s eerie incantations commenced.Nothing happened for an excruciatingly long time.- 232 -Then in an interval of tense silence, she gavethe tiniest of twitches, and one of her breast-crossedarms fell limply to her side.That was all - but it was quite enough for ourguests, who all bolted for the front door in rawpanic. William Castle couldn’t have done it better!b. WorkingsWorkings are rituals intended to initiate oraccomplish something. If in the OU, LBM. If in oneor more SUs, GBM.The “target” of a working may be [or include]one or more of the participants/others present. Or aworking may be wholly directed towards persons orsituations who are not present.The three basic examples in the originalSatanic Bible - curse, compassion, & lust - areworkings, but are obviously intended as conceptoutlines. To be seriously effective, considerablymore research, preparation, and tailoring wouldneed to be applied.Both LBM & GBM workings may, but notalways involve contact with and activation of thePowers of Darkness: principles (Dæmons or“Elementals”) aligned with the Prince of Darkness.If you’re not fully prepared for this, don’t do it.One of the considerations in any working isobvious its impact on other people. Until the lastcouple of centuries, Western society fullyappreciated the efficacy of Black Magic, so if a localmagician became too threatening to a community’stranquillity, a burning-party was held. Today BlackMagic officially doesn’t exist, so you can’t beprosecuted for it. But it’s prudent to keep workingsstrictly secret nevertheless. This is one success- 233 -which absolutely does not come with “braggingrights”.4. IncantationsThe difference between an invocation and anevocation is that the former simply acknowledgesthe power of the Power to enhance the working,while the latter specifically solicits its activity.The “Invocation to Satan” in the originalSatanic Bible is an articulation to formalize theintentions of the magician and his/participants’deserving of dæmonic attention/augmentation assincere Satanists. What that Invocation is not iscommunication with those entities.The reason for this is that they exist, functioning, and communicate through their respective SUs,and the Prince of Darkness’ CSU. Thus they aremetaphysical, not physical beings; and themagician’s working-contact with them is through hisown metaphysical MindStar, specifically the Khabitin cases of “common” working objectives. So voicedspeech is irrelevant except insofar as it services tofocus vague attitudes and sentiments into explicit,specific intentions and goals.5. EthicsA working affecting other humans may de factopassing judgment on them. This is conventionally aprerogative of society, the state of which you are acitizen, at the basic level of what Thomas Aquinascalled Human Law (HL). This is the profane legalsystem of popular acquaintance: the legacy of the“social contract” era of government.- 234 -While profane society is perfectly content tojudge and condemn individuals and groups onnothing more than the excuse of HL, this isatrociously inadequate by Satanic standards.Above HL on Aquinas’ hierarchy is Divine Law(DL), the revealed dictates of El, which HL issupposed to incorporate and emulate. Above this isNL, in which humans participate to the extent theyare assumed to be OU constitutions. Atop all this isEternal Law (EL), which consists of El’s privatemotives and habits for being the sadistic creep thathe is.In the non-El reality of Satanism, DL does notexist, because, as Belial notes in the Diabolicon, theBlack Flame endows humanity with its own absoluteprerogative to assign values, including morality(Good/Evil). NL remains the neteru-establishedorder of the OU, which does not include morality[except to the extent that an argument can be madefor ecological balance & regularity being de factomoral]. EL describes the arbitrary will of the neteruto be as they are, which is obviously beyond humanconcern.So if HL is incompetent and DL nonexistent,the Satanist is responsible for ascertaining andupholding an authentic, compromised standard ofjustice: what Plato sought in his Republic Dialogueas the Agathon.This is why it is so much more difficult to be aSatanist than a profane, vulgar human. And whySatanists are so extraordinary painstaking aboutworkings that judge and affect others.- 235 -6. ConsequencesWhether a ritual is a ceremony or a working,LBM or GBM, its purpose is to replace ambiguity &aimlessness into a focused, effective concentrationof intelligence & energy which, once set in motion,cannot be stopped - in some cases, indeed, even bythe casting-magician personally. Hence the BlackMagical adage: Be certain this is really what youwant, because there is no turning-back.The “King Midas”, or more contemporarily Dr.Seuss’ Bartholomew & the Oobleck warning too:Beware of “unintended consequences”. Presetcareful limits on your workings, lest you conjuredæmons easier to invite in than to invite out.7. Black Massa. Satanic Rituals:Missa SolemnisThe “backstory” of the Missa Solemnis BlackMass in the Satanic Rituals is recounted indocumented detail in my Church of Satan, but canbe summarized here:The concept of an anti-Catholic Black Massoriginated with J-K. Huysmans’ sensationaluridpotboiler la-Bas125, purporting to expose sordid125 Huysmans, Joris-Karl, La-Bas (Down There). New York:Dover, 1972. Actually French Catholics were havingdeluridlicious “Black Mass” fantasies about Palladists, whowere a trendy version of non-antiCatholic, non-babycannibalistic Rosicrucianism. But who cared?- 236 -Satanism among decadent Parisian elites of the late19th Century. 126Once the Church of Satan got started,therefore, Anton LaVey began to be pestered for aYouKnowWhat, despite the fact that as an ex-Jew hedidn’t harbor any particular passions againstCatholicism.But there was one Satanic Priest who did:Wayne F. West, a defrocked Catholic priest inDetroit. Wayne’s hatred of Christianity in general,and Catholicism in particular, approached thepathological, and he was only too happy to take theCatholic High Mass and rework it into a version thatleft la-Bas’ in the dust.I, assisted by Irish professor Priest JamesMoody, was invited to celebrate its premiereperformance at the Central Grotto.To say that my prudery was “challenged” is anunderstatement. I immediately telephoned Diane: “Ican’t possibly do this!” She giggled, clearly notsurprised. “Feel free to edit it.”So Jim and I got through it with our clothes onand dignity intact. The only mishap was myoverenthusiastic use of the incendiary flashpowder“Dragon’s Breath”, which set the living altar on firein an unmentionable place, eliciting a yowl from herand a burst of laughter from the assemblage, theHigh Priest & Priestess not excluded.So when it came time to include the Black Massin Anton’s Satanic Rituals, there was no way it was126 This same play has run continuously on BlasphemousBroadway over the centuries; only the cast has changed - fromJews to Freemasons to Popists to anarchists to Mormons tosocialists to Nazis to Communists to Satanists to Muslims toillegal aliens to Illuminati ...- 237 -going to be West’s XXX masterpiece. The PG-13 oneappeared instead. 127b. Room 101The [more precisely a] Black Mass is in a classby itself. Indeed it’s not intrinsically either White orBlack Magic; it’s more of an emotional enema topermit magic to be commenced.Within Western cultures, in which Judæo/Christianity remains the prevalent religiouspreconditioning, resistance to and rejection of thesechains occasionally requires the formality andintensity of a disintoxication ritual: the BlackMass.The purpose of any Black Mass is to purgeparticipants or onlookers of any preconditionedsuperstitions to which their enslavement is beyondreasoned discourse, as a consequence of oldsuperstitions or indoctrinations.Once one has seen his sacred cows trampledupon with impunity, he will never again feel thesame fear of them, no matter how pro forma herecognizes the desecration to have been:The liberation of the human mind has neverbeen furthered by dunderheads; it has beenfurthered by gay fellows who heaved dead cats intosanctuaries and then went roistering down thehighways of the world, proving to all men thatdoubt, after all, was safe - that the god in thesanctuary was finite in his power and hence afraud. One horselaugh is worth ten thousand127 If you just can’t stand it, the unexpurgated WW original isreproduced as Appendix #7 of my The Church of Satan. Shameon you!- 238 -syllogisms. It is not only more effective; it is alsovastly more intelligent. 128Substantially more chillingly George Orwellillustrates a secular version of the Black Mass in1984, wherein the magician O’Brien forces hissubject Winston Smith to “trample upon the sacredcow” of his love for Julia. Although Winstonrecognizes that unendurable psychological terrorwas used on him, he nonetheless finds himselfunable to recapture his original illusion of self-sacrificial love for her.Julia, put through a similar “Black Mass”incorporating differently-personalized elements ofemotional impasse, experiences the same disruptionof her illusions:“Sometimes,” she said [to Winston], “theythreaten you with something - something you can’tstand up to, can’t even think about. And then yousay, ‘Don’t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do itto so-and-so.’ And perhaps you might pretend,afterwards, that it was only a trick and that youjust said it to make them stop and didn’t reallymean it. But that isn’t true. At the time when ithappens, you do mean it. You think there’s noother way of saving yourself, and you’re quiteready to save yourself that way. You want it tohappen to the other person. You don’t give a damnwhat they suffer. All you care about is yourself.”“All you care about is yourself,” he echoed.“And after that you don’t feel the sametoward the other person any longer.”“No,” he said, “you don’t feel the same.” 129128 Mencken, H.L., “The Iconoclast” in Prejudices: FourthSeries. New York: Knopf, 1924, pages #139-40.129 Orwell, George, 1984. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co.,1949, page #240.- 239 -In 1984 every “Room 101” ritual was tailored toeach subject’s personal, unique “sacred cow”.Similarly each religious Black Mass isconfigured to dispel the most crippling terrors ofthe indoctrinated faith. Hence a Black Mass for aMormon would be quite different from that for aMuslim or Buddhist.The Black Mass principle was brought forwardinto the “mind-control brainwashing” of Cold Warconspiracy theory by John Frankenheimer’sManchurian Candidate (1962), in which a KoreanWar soldier has been “brainwashed” to obeycommands upon seeing the Queen of Diamondsplaying card:Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey): Theycan make me do anything, Ben, can’t they?Anything.Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra): We’llsee what they can do, and we’ll see what we cando. So the red queen is our baby. Well, take a lookat this, kid: 52 of them! 52 red queens and I aretelling you it’s over. The links, the beautifullyconditioned links are smashed as of now becausewe say so. We’re busting up the joint, we’retearing out all the wires. We're busting it up sogood all the queen’s horses and all the queen’smen will never put old Raymond back togetheragain. You don’t work any more. That’s anorder. Anybody invites you to a game of solitaire,you tell them sorry, buster, the ball game is over.It is important to note that a Black Mass in noway seeks to re-indoctrinate its subject with anyother belief-system; it is a chain-breakingexperience only.- 240 -B. ChamberThe term “chamber” usually brings to mind aroom or hall customized for ritual purposes andactivities: Wall-mounted Sigil of Baphomet behindan altar large & stable enough to contain not onlyinstruments but a “living altar” perched atop,seating & open working areas, and accessories asneeded [such as sound system].There is nothing wrong with a traditionalchamber, but what’s important here is that youunderstand exactly what its function is: first, toprovide a human sensory disconnect between therealm of physical stimulus/response reality and onein which the physical senses are either muted orcontrolled by inputs of your own decision, such thatthey all serve to focus and enhance the mental stateyou wish to attain and sustain.Secondly the sensation that whenever you arein the chamber, the outside world is set aside andeverything now surrounding you, reflecting you,represents your SU. wherein you are the controllingdeity.This does not change for rituals in which othersare present as participants or guests, except as youmay decide to modify aspects of the chamberenvironment for them. This may be as simple as justthe inclusion of additional chairs, or as complex as aredesign, time rescheduling, etc. As always, whereothers are concerned, their respect for the sanctityand reality of the chamber is vital; if anyone falters,he must exit immediately to wait elsewhere.An amusing personal experience will serve toillustrate the importance of chamber atmosphereestablishment. My first visit to the LaVey home in1969 was to hear one of Anton’s public lectures.- 241 -These were given in the main ritual chamber, whereaudience-chairs had been set up. Interestinglyordinary folding chairs are so incidental that theirpresence or absence is not a significant atmosphericdisruption.Entering the room, I was immediately struck byits creation of a SU utterly divorced from “normalSan Francisco” - just beyond the shuttered windows,but suddenly a universe away. It was exciting butalso disturbing; I was suddenly cast adrift in a“magical elsewhere” in which I had no foothold, nosensory reassurances of a “comfort distance”. Thislecturer might enter, wave his hand, and transformus all into rabbits! Yes, an absurdity here/now, butnot there/then.My frantic search for “normalcy” now landedmy gaze on the Wurlitzer organ console ... and there,sitting unobtrusively on it, was one of the sculpturedglass ashtrays from the Franciscan restaurant onFisherman’s Wharf.The spell was shattered, and I breathed a sighof relief. The infamous Anton Szandor LaVey mightbe an incarnate fiend from Hell, but he was humanenough to abscond with a souvenir ashtray. I knew Iwould leave the lecture alive [and with small pinkears instead of large furry ones].As you conceive and create your own ritualchamber(s), you will become well-aware of theatmospheric-disconnection, particularly if you havethe space to set it completely apart from normalrooms or areas. Even if it shares space, thecommencement of a ritual will accomplish thisproportionately.You will also notice how very alien this is to theatmosphere of any conventional church, whichmight as well be a schoolroom or concert hall.- 242 -As a Black Magician you will also learnsomething else about consecrated Satanic ritualchambers: they don’t like being violated. Anyprofane person who intentionally or accidentallyenters will get that feeling often described as“someone walking on your grave” - and leave with ashudder. 130 No, profane churches don’t get this perkeither; enjoy!C. InstrumentsThe original Satanic Bible discusses variousimplements traditionally used for concentration,emphasis, and ritual stage-demarcation: candles,sword, bell, Black Flame, Baphomet emblem, not tomention the SB itself if you forget yourself at acrucial moment and need to look something up in ahurry (!).As indeed with the chamber itself (a “largeinstrument”), specific items are up to you; feel freeto ad/delete as feels right.Again a suggestion from my own and others’experience: Don’t even bother with generic/mass-produced anythings. Craft it yourself, receive it as amagical gift, or discover it under magicalcircumstances. In addition to the magical meaningthese have for you, if consecrated for magical use,130 This is a function of the Khabit MindStar emanation,Chapter #13.C.3, page #196. The Khabit has the capacity toimpress an OU locale with a T- or L-Field “signature”: whathumans actually encounter as “ghosts”, “haunted houses”, etc.The Khabit is unique in that it can “disconnect” from the coreMindStar for such distant activities. It is for this same reasonthat a Khabit-encounter can be dangerous; unlike a Ka, it isnot a seat of personality, hence does not distinguish friendfrom foe in a “signature” vigilance.- 243 -they also carry the “signature” of your MindStar ifpassed meaningfully to someone else. 131D. AttireRitual dress once again varies with bothpersonal style and the flavor of the ritual to beperformed. As previously, respect for the underlyingdignity of all Satanic ritual is axiomatic. This doesnot always translate to tuxedos and evening gowns,but duly to good taste, cleanliness, and pride.The 1966-75 Church of Satan had a simple butstrict dress code for formal rituals, such as theSatanic Mass or ceremonies of baptism orPriesthood ordination:Robes were black, with blue & purple trim forthe IV° & V° respectively.2” Baphomet medallions of the individual’sdegree color to be worn on dignified, discrete chains,uncluttered with any other device.The Baphomet colors were: Satanist I° red,Witch/Warlock II° white, Priest/Priestess III° black,Magister/Magistra IV° blue, and Magus/Maga V°purple.Anton LaVey officially ended the Church’sinitiatory-degree system in 1975, simultaneouslydiscontinuing degree color-coding for medallions.Detailed information concerning the Church’soriginal initiatory-degree system is contained in myThe Church of Satan documentary history.Post-May 1975, accordingly, a sincere Satanistmay wear a Baphomet of any color personallypreferred.131 In this case it is not the “signature” of the ominous Khabit,but the deeply personal one of the Ab (Chapter #13.C.4, page#197).- 244 -E. OathJust one more thing:Before you decide to undertake Satanic Ritual -to perform Black Magic in his name, it is well to bequite certain of your sincerity and to so state it byoath in your very first working.The most defining characteristic of the Satanistis the complete, ecstatic glorification of the BlackFlame and its transcognitive power.Your Oath can and should be your own, as mostpersonal and meaningful to you. Here are twoexamples:Among the ceremonies of the Church of Satanwas an “adult baptism” but not an induction or oath-taking per se. Therefore I composed the oath, firstadministered at the chartering of the NinevehGrotto in 1970 and subsequently incorporated intothe Baptism contained in the Satanic Rituals. If youfeel so moved, here is the original:I, [name], having forsworn the divinemindlessness, do proclaim the majesty of my ownbeing among the marvels of the Universe. I rejectoblivion of Self, and I accept the pleasure and painof unique existence. I am returned from death tolife, and I declare my friendship with Lucifer, theLord of Light who is exalted as Satan. I receive theSigil of Baphomet [here the Baphomet medallionis touched to the Initiate’s brow], and I embracethe Black Flame of the Order of the Trapezoid.[Here the medallion is passed through the Flameand then placed around the Initiate’s neck.]132132 Aquino, Michael A., Priest of Mendes III°, Nineveh Grotto,Brandenburg, Kentucky, October 31, 1970.- 245 -The Church of Satan was not the first to soformalize Satanist allegiance. In The Devil’s DiscipleGeorge Bernard Shaw’s title character affirmed:I was brought up in the other service; but Iknew from the first that the Devil was my naturalmaster and captain and friend.I saw that he was in the right, and that theworld cringed to his conqueror only through fear.I prayed secretly to him, and he comfortedme and saved me from having my spirit broken inthis house of children’s tears.I promised him my soul, and swore an oaththat I would stand up for him in this world andstand by him in the next.That promise and that oath made a man ofme. From this day this house is his home, and nochild shall cry in it; this hearth is his altar, and nosoul shall ever cower over it in the dark eveningsand be afraid. 133133 Shaw, George Bernard, “Richard Dudgeon” (Kirk Douglas)in The Devil’s Disciple, 1959.- 246 -[index-247_1.jpg]- 247 -IVLeviathanGloria Aqua- 248 -[index-249_1.jpg]- 249 -Backstory:The Enochian KeysA. Enoch1.Long-Lived Sex ManiacWho’s Enoch?You already know who he is, but you may notknow that you know it.This is because Enoch, the seventh master ofthe world after Adam in the “Old Testament”, isconsidered to be the Hebrew equivalent of thePhœnician Cadmus, the Greek Hermes, and theEgyptian Thoth. As such he is the reputed author ofthe Tarot, the Cabala, and the apocryphal Book ofEnoch.He receives only a brief mention in “Genesis”,where the fifth chapter recounts:And Enoch lived sixty and five years, andbegat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with Godafter he begat Methuselah three hundred years,and begat sons and daughters: And all the days ofEnoch were three hundred sixty and five years:And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; forGod took him.- 250 -365 years is quite a lifespan, but to find out whathe did during them, we have to turn, notunreasonably, to his own memoir.2. Book of Enocha. ApocalypticismThe Book of Enoch comprises a part of what iscalled “Apocalyptic” literature. The Apocalyptistswere a school of pre-Rabbinical Jews who believedthat the world was in such a hopeless mess as to beincurable by any of man’s efforts. Thus it was only aquestion of time, they said, before El would scheduleanother Great Flood, clean house, and have a thirdgo at it.Their name - Apocalyptists - meant “revealers”,and they spent most of their time revealing thisrather pessimistic prediction to any & all who wouldlisten.Apocalyptists were the first “predestinarians”,inasmuch as they believed that the progress of manwas mapped by El from start to finish.They also believed in the spirit of El’s law, notthe letter. In this they differed from the other majorbranch of the Jewish faith, Pharisaism.b. Origins & AuthorsThe Apocalyptic literature is generally fixed tothe period 200-150 BCE, which makes itcomparatively recent. Thus its value lies not somuch in its own existence as in the possiblesignificance of the old legends which wereincorporated into it.- 251 -Most scholars agree that the Book of Enoch is theoldest of the Apocalyptic works. It seems to havebeen written by a number of various authors, theearliest being a Jew from the Land of Dan innorthern Palestine.The original text was probably written in eitherthe Enochian dialect134 or Aramaic. Later it wastranslated into Greek and Latin, both of whichtranslations didn’t survive the eclipse of the HolyRoman Empire.The Greek version was translated into Ethiopian,however. It was this document which was brought tolight in our own time, when an explorer namedBruce brought back a copy from Abyssinia in theyear 1773 CE.This curious odyssey of the Book of Enoch hasbeen remarked upon by more than one student ofancient literature. It was to become a model, forinstance, for H.P. Lovecraft’s fabled Necronomicon,paralleling much of its content as well as itsobscurity.In non-fiction it bears a strong resemblance tothe Diabolicon and to what is perhaps the singlemost powerful text to have come down to us fromancient Egypt - the XVII Chapter of the EgyptianBook of the Dead.The most complete version of the Book of theDead is included in the Turin Papyrus, XXVIDynasty, in the Egyptian Museum at Turin, Italy. Itsfull title is “The Praises and Glorifyings of ComingForth by Day”, and it is the only known Khemite134 An ancient Hebrew dialect - not related to the text of the“Enochian Keys”.- 252 -work which proposes to explain the actual creationof the cosmos. 135c.ContentsThe Book of Enoch is sometimes referred to as “IEnoch” to distinguish it from “II Enoch”, or TheSecrets of Enoch, a later work executed in Slavonic.The Book of Enoch contains six chapters:1. The Book of Enoch2. The Parables3. The Book of the Courses of theHeavenly Luminaries4. The Dream-Visions5. The Conclusion6. The Noah FragmentsFollowing is a synopsis of the more importantparts of the entire work:(1) The Book of EnochIn a dream Enoch is asked to intercede for theso-called Watchers, a group of fallen Angels whodeparted from Heaven to mate with human females.The chief of the Watchers is Semjaza, identified withSatan.The results of such unions were monstrousgiants who destroyed the Earth and practiced bothcannibalism and vampirism.Enoch writes out the petition and receives hisanswer in the form of visions. The request is refused,135 See The Book of the Dead by E.A. Wallis Budge for anexcellent translation.- 253 -and Enoch is instructed to tell the Watchers, “Youhave no peace.”An account is then given of Enoch’s subsequentjourneys through certain areas of Earth and Hell( Sheol). Worthy of note are his impressions of theHeavenly Palace of pre-Fall Satan:And I went in til I drew nigh to a wall whichis built of crystals and surrounded by tongues offire, and it began to affright me.And I went into the tongues of fire and drewnigh to a large house which was built of crystals.The walls of the house were like a tessellated floorof crystals, and its groundwork was of crystal. Itsceiling was like the path of the stars and thelightnings, and between them were fiery Cherubimamidst a background of water.A blazing fire surrounded the walls, and itsportals were covered with fire.And I entered into that house, and it was ashot as fire yet as cold as ice.There were no delights of life therein. Fearcovered me, and trembling gat hold of me.And I quaked and trembled and fell downupon my face.Shortly thereafter Enoch beholds the Black Flame:From thence I went to another place to thewest of the ends of the Earth.And I saw a burning fire which ran withoutresting, and paused not from its course day ornight but blazed without respite.And I asked, saying, “What is this flamewhich burns unceasingly?”Then Raguel, one of the holy Angels whowas with me, said, “This is the darkish Fire in theWest which persecutes all the luminaries ofHeaven.”- 254 -(2) The ParablesThere are three of these, each having as its themethe destruction of injustice. For the first time inHebraic literature, vengeance is promised on Earth -in this life - rather than in an afterlife.In the First Parable El - herein called the “Lordof Spirits” - and the Elect One or “Son of Man” areidentified. The four principal ArchAngels are alsonamed.The Second Parable speaks of the joy to befound in vengeance by the righteous against theirpersecutors. This also is a somewhat peculiar themefor the Hebraic religion.The Third Parable is generally a continuationof the Second, being a commentary upon the Day ofJudgment. It is incomplete in the transcript whichhas come down to us, however, since the theme hasbeen haphazardly intermixed with references to theNoah legend.(3) The Book of the Courses ofthe Heavenly LuminariesAnd the Sun and the stars bring in all theyears exactly, so that they do not advance or delaytheir position by a single day unto eternity, butcomplete the years with perfect justice in 364 days.This is the keynote of this chapter - that thepassage of time is to be calculated by the Sun, notthe Moon.Quaintly enough, it is fairly obvious from theobservations set forth in the rest of the chapter thatthe author was familiar with the actual solar year of365-1/4 days! The erroneous statement seems tostem from his reluctance to honor the “heathen”- 255 -mathematics of the Egyptians, Sumerians, andGreeks. In any case he is definitely opposed to thePharisaic system of reckoning time by the Moon.The chapter closes with yet another curiousnotation: that man’s natural sinfulness will causethe Sun and Moon to mislead him. 136(4) The Dream-VisionsHere is recounted a contemporary history of theancient nation of Israel. It is followed by(5) The ConclusionThis predicts the coming of a new kingdom - buton Earth, not in an afterlife.The destruction of the existing Earth and Heavenis foretold, followed by the institution of a “newHeaven”.The final section of the book is(6) The Noah FragmentsA narrative of the deluge, with nothing out of theordinary to distinguish it from more familiarversions of the story.d. Significance(1) The “First Commandment”Why did the Judæo/Christian El-cult survive andeventually capture the entire Roman Empire? The136 Presumably by those sneaky eclipses.- 256 -answer is not at all elusive: stupidity andintolerance.All of the major rival, preexisting religions ofMediterranean antiquity by the time of the cross-culturism of Alexander’s empire - Greek, Roman,Egyptian, Persian, Indian, Babylonian, Odinic - hadhighly-elaborate metaphysical elements, utterlybewildering to the unsophisticated, illiterate masses.Exclusive, exhaustively initiated priesthoods werenecessary to interpret them.While this sufficed intellectually, it did notsatisfy emotionally; ordinary people wanted divineattention, even if it were oppressive: Better to bepunished than ignored.Secondly the alternative religions had long sincebecome accustomed to existence in a multiculturalworld. They were confident enough in theirrespective substance as not to feel threatened bycompetition. Pagan Rome had temples of Isis next toones for Jupiter and Mithra without friction. Indeedmany Romans “mixed and matched” between deities- resulting, among other things, in the crazyquilt ofday- & month-names, along with variable-theme &overlapping holidays and festivals, which havesurvived to modernity.El, on the other hand, was a jealous, murderous,and totalitarian god - an absolute intoleranceenforced by his prophets, priests, and of courseproclaimed son.So this Hebrew cult was not only easilyunderstandable by even the most stupid andignorant; but everywhere it advanced, it denounced,suppressed, and finally exterminated all otherbeliefs - indeed reviling other gods as “devils” and“dæmons”.- 257 -(2) And the First HereticEnoch not only petitioned El on behalf of Satanand his followers; he visited his palace and, likeAyesha of Kôr, dared to approach the Black Flameitself. He anticipated further changes in the race ofMan from its intermarriage with Angels, and thecomplete recreation of not only Earth but Heaven aswell.These blasphemies were clearly enough to banhis Book from the “Old Testament” or othersanctioned Hebraic texts.(3) And That “Missing Link”Running throughout LHP cosmology is thetantalizing, indeed inescapable premise thathumanity is not just another OU-animal born of NL-happenstance: that the phenomenon of isolate self-consciousness is fundamentally alien to NL - andnowhere-else echoed by EL or DL.As discussed in “Lucifer”, we also know theapproximate date of this event: ca. 100,000 BCE.[No] thanks to the most determined efforts ofprofane religions to obliterate anything & everythingthreatening their totalitarianisms, we can tracerecorded history back only 5,000 years.It is beyond rational question that one, indeedprobably several advanced civilizations rose and fellduring those missing 95,000 years.

Investigating the Keys1.John DeeOn April 13, 1584 CE John Dee, mathematicianand magician to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,undertook a series of Workings in Cracow, Poland.With the assistance of Edward Kelley, he wrote intohis diaries a series of nineteen magical incantationsin what he called the “Enochian or Angelic137 J.R.R. Tolkien, unable to resist temptation, includedAtlantis in his sagæ as Númenor. After the Valar got annoyedand pulled the plug, it was renamed Atalantë, with its highestmountaintop ( Meneltarma) barely above-water in emulationof Atlantis’ Mount Pico in the Azores.

With each incantation or Key Deeprovided an English translation, also communicatedby the angels to Kelley.2. Meric. CasaubonIn 1659 the Dee diaries containing the Keys werepublished by Meric. Casaubon as A True andFaithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeersbetween Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits. 1393. Samuel MathersIn the late nineteenth century the Casaubon textof the Enochian Keys was adopted into the magicalinventory of the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, a London-based Rosicrucian society. TheGolden Dawn altered and augmented the Keys inorder to align them with its own emphasis on theHebrew Cabala, and its publications assert amastery of the Enochian language by the leaders ofthe Order. 1404. Aleister CrowleyAleister Crowley later incorporated the GoldenDawn edition of the Keys into his A.'.A.'., again139 Deacon, Richard, John Dee.

Anton LaVeyThe Keys next appeared in 1969 CE, when AntonLaVey took the Cabalistic version from Crowley’sEquinox, replaced references to the Judæo/Christian El with references to Satan, and includedthe result in his Satanic Bible. 1426. Francis RegardieThe general sensation caused by this book,together with a considerable amount of indignationon the part of old-line Cabalists, eventually inspireda revival of interest in John Dee and his magicaldiaries. Easily the most vehement of the “purists”was the Rosicrucian scholar Francis “Israel”Regardie - though his “purity” extended only as farback as the Mathers modifications. 1437. Stephen SkinnerIn 1974 Stephen Skinner brought out a second(facsimile) edition of A True and Faithful Relation,a copy of which I acquired in March of the followingyear.141 Crowley, Aleister, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley. NewYork: Hill & Wang, 1969, page #612.142 LaVey, Anton Szandor, The Satanic Bible. New York: AvonBooks, 1969, pages #155-272.143 Regardie (Ed.) in Crowley, Aleister, The Vision and theVoice. Dallas: Sangreal Foundation, 1972, page #10.- 261 -8. Michael AquinoUpon comparing the facsimile Casaubon to theGolden Dawn, Crowley, and LaVey Keys, I realizedthe extent of the distortion that had taken place.Being familiar with language and cipherconstruction, I set out to unravel the original Keys todetermine their linguistic lineage.After some weeks of work, I concluded thatEnochian is not a true language. Rather it is anartificial jargon, i.e. arbitrary words placed togetherin roughly consistent sequences to simulate a truelanguage. It is so cleverly done that it can fool non-linguists fairly easily:9. DictionariansWe have here fragmentary pieces of a veryancient tongue - a language which is far older eventhan the Sanskrit. 144Immediately after admitting that he is nophilologist and is “without the least scientificknowledge of comparative languages”, FrancisRegardie offers the above statement about Enochian- which may be discounted accordingly.The story continues, however: Aleister Crowleyincluded virtually the same sentence in hisConfessions (page #612), again with no supportingevidence whatever.Then Anton LaVey, assuming that both Regardieand Crowley must have known what they were144 Regardie, The Golden Dawn, Volume II, page #266.- 262 -talking about, included virtually the same sentencein his Satanic Bible (page #155).Later attempts to validate Enochian as alanguage or to place it historically - Donald C.Laycock’s The Complete Enochian Dictionary(London: Askin, 1978) and Geoffrey James’ TheEnochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee (BerkeleyHeights, NJ: Heptangle Books, 1984) - have metwith similar failure. James, following Laycock,reaches the conclusion that the unpronounceablewords and random letter arrangements of Enochianindicate that it was designed for non-materialentities [lacking vocal cords]! 145The last word was written by Hans Holzer in hisThe Truth About Witchcraft (1969), in which hecalled the language “Inelkian” and labeled it “a formof distorted Hebrew”!It is even possible to “write” in Enochian asCrowley did, altering suffixes to create theimpression of declension or conjugation. But acomprehensive grammar, essential to a true writtenor spoken tongue, is lacking.10. YuggothicFor an example of how a jargon may be used, seepages #181-201 of the Satanic Rituals by AntonLaVey. In 1971 I ghostwrote the entire section onH.P. Lovecraft - introduction and rituals - for thebook.It was the work of about two months to developthe jargon that became the “nameless language” [I145 I suspect that Laycock & James borrowed this idea fromH.P. Lovecraft, who used it to explain the bizarre names &incantations he developed for his alien entities.- 263 -called it “Yuggothic”] of the Ceremony of the NineAngles and the Call to Cthulhu.A word that sounded properly “Lovecraftian”would be constructed arbitrarily: El-aka = world,gryenn’h = [of] horrors. Then the word would beused consistently throughout the text of both rituals.Slight modifications of endings would suffice fordifferent sentence constructions, and there you havea “language” every bit as flexible as Enochian. 14611. Cryptologic?Once I realized Enochian to be a jargon, Ichanged my approach. Now I suspected that it mightbe some sort of cipher or code, Dee being famous forhis use of same.I tested the first three Keys against a variety ofcode-breaking techniques. 147 Once more I met withno success. I had not held high hopes that I would.The loose alignment of Enochian words to theirEnglish counterparts, together with an entirelydifferent frequency of individual letters in the twolanguages [even cancelling out the most divergentletters], makes cipher improbable.Only pure code - with Enochian words or lettersmeaning something not revealed by their internaldesign alone - remained. To uncover such a code,one would simply have to know the words orphrases in English triggered by a given Enochianword or phrase, unrelated though the connectionmight otherwise be. [For example, the otherwise146 See Appendices #72-74 of The Church of Satan.147 from my experience with the U.S. National Security Agency,concerned among other things with cryptography.- 264 -random appearance of “vorsg” might be code for “forthe Queen’s eyes only”, etc.]Two avenues of investigation remained. First, ifit were true that Enochian were neither languagenor cipher, then there was still the possibility that itmight be a corruption of a genuine tongue. Regardie[citing Mathers’ method], Crowley, and LaVey hadall accepted Kelley’s comment that “He seemeth toread as Hebrew is read”. 14812. Stripping HebrewI decided to eliminate this Hebrew-letterpronunciation entirely, treating each word as aphonetic unity and deemphasizing the vowels. [Thus“vorsg” should be pronounced just that way, ratherthan “vaoresaji”.]My test case was the XIX Key, 30th Æthyr (TEX)on the assumption that there might be visual resultsper Crowley’s experiences in The Vision and TheVoice. 149This time there was a certain success, in that Iexperienced a sequence of unusual visions anddreams. 150Finally, during the evening of May 30, 1975, Iexperimented with the XVII Key and was rewarded148 Casaubon, op. cit. , page #120.Crowley (Ed. Regardie), Gems from the Equinox. St. Paul:Lewellyn Publications, 1974, page #408.149 Crowley (Ed. Regardie), Gems from the Equinox, pages#408-591.150 See the record of one such example in Chapter #1.- 265 -with spectacular results - the “Sphinx and Chimæra”Working. 15113. Word of SetThen, in the first week of June, something quiteunexpected happened. I began to write a text ininstallments of one or two hours per night. In thesame style as the future Book of Coming Forth byNight, it declared the Enochian Keys to be a distantcorruption of something called the Word of Set.There followed two “pure” Keys in English -called “parts” of the Word of Set.Before proceeding further I was forced to breakmy concentration because of the sudden crisis in theChurch of Satan, and so the Word of Set remainedunfinished for the next six years.As to the “breaking” of the Keys “by the doctrinesof Anton LaVey”, therein lies still another tale.Anton’s principal contribution to the CrowleyKeys was to render them in what might be called a“Black Mass” form, with Heavenly referencesarbitrarily changed to Infernal ones.One might presume that this would invalidatethe statements of the text.Oddly enough, however, the use of these “BlackKeys” by the Church of Satan produced magicalresults that were, if anything, far more powerfulthan those of the “pure” system.In my Working on the Word of Set, I used anapproach similar to Anton’s, seeking words toexpress what I seemed to sense the Keys wereactually intended to say. In short I was endeavoring151 Reprinted as the “Afterwords” of MindStar.- 266 -to present the Keys in a still “Blacker” version thanthat which appears in the Satanic Bible.Moreover the North Solstice X Working whichresulted in the Book of Coming Forth by Night wasbegun with this new First Part of the Word of Setrather than with the First Enochian Key. Such wouldseem to be the basis for the Book of Coming Forthby Night’s reference to the “breaking” of the oldKeys.Six years later the Working of the Word of Setwas finally completed - on April 13, 1981(anniversary of John Dee’s initial Working).In the Satanic Bible the Enochian Keys, even intheir altered form, are still garbled andunintelligible. Hence Anton felt the need to venturean interpretation of each one preceding its text.These interpretations have no basis in previousdocuments, and indeed previous commentators -including Dee himself - had been unable to integratethe Keys into a coherent translation.After completing the Working of the Word of Set,I found that the new translation needed no externalinterpretation - at least not for those to whom it wasevidently addressed.Obviously it is idiomatic and not a word-for-word translation - as are all translations fromoriginal hieroglyphs.In 1980, furthermore, I learned that theCasaubon account of the Dee Keys was not as error-free as I had previously supposed.My benefactor was an Initiate of the Temple ofSet who kindly provided me with a completemicrofilm of the original Dee diary Keys from theBritish Museum. Hence the “Enochian” textreproduced with the Word of Set is an exact copy of- 267 -the original as John Dee penned it, includingcapitalization.As I have noted above, this original does not lenditself to grammatically-based translation or to word-for-word correlation with Dee’s own English“translation”.[The most recent efforts to do so - in DonaldLaycock’s Enochian Dictionary - resulted in anarbitrary subdividing of the Enochian text and theaddition of a modern-English-based punctuation inorder to “force” a correlation. The quality of theresult is self-evident.]An “Enochian purist” might question thetranslation provided by the Word of Set in that it isnot the English version recorded by John Dee in hisdiaries.My answer is simply that I approached the Keysnot as a historian seeking to reprint what Dee did,but as a magician seeking to operate the same“magical machinery” that Dee did - and to operate itwith greater care and precision than he did.Hence it is not a case of my “corrupting Dee”, butrather of my uncorrupting something whichpredated Dee’s own existence, and which was, afterall, not of his [or Kelley’s] authorship.Were one to take the position that the Keys are aDee/Kelley creation, then they would befraudulent as a GBM Working - and merely anuncommonly-successful LBM stunt which hasmystified and obsessed occultists these manycenturies.As it appears here, then, the Word of Set is aneighteenfold sequence of statements addressed tothe original (“third ordering”) Initiates of theTemple of Set in ancient times. The 19th Part is notso much a statement as an operative invocation to- 268 -be used for access to what Dee referred to as the“thirty aires or æthyrs”.14. ÆthyrsUse of this invocation is best described inCrowley’s Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh; see also TheVision and The Voice.What exactly is an “æthyr”? Cabalistically theseare “rings” or “spheres” [of consciousness]progressively closer to the universal godhead.Per Crowley, each æthyr also awakens certainkinds of dispositions and perceptions in a magicianwho focuses his attention towards it - and may alsoprovide him with access to related magical toolsand/or weapons.15. In-SightNeither Set/Satan nor an operating BlackMagician, however, would be interested in the [13th-Century faked] Cabala, nor in “psychoanalyzing” El.But what the 30 æthyrs seem to comprise issomething actually more personal and intricate: aprogressively more refined perspective of themagician’s own MindStar: as a “comprehensiveacross-section”, not something “broken down by theeight emanations”. Thus the magician might, ineffect, examine his Khat with 30 different“resolutions”. The same “lenses” could be applied tocombinations of emanations to discover theirinteractions.These are just some possibilities andspeculations; this is very much a “blank slate” ofFGBM, open to many different experiments andexplorations.- 269 -Where LBM is concerned, obviously, the Word ofSet version does not lend itself to the same “castingemphases” as the LaVey Keys. What in those Keysseemed to be, in Crowley’s terms, “barbarous wordsof evocation” are in the Word of Set simplystraightforward communication and information.Fortunately the “World of Horrors” is replete withan abundance of BWoE, so the magician workinghimself up to “ritual criticality” should find ampleinspiration ready to hand!- 270 -[index-271_1.jpg]- 271 -16: Word of Set- 272 -[index-273_1.jpg]- 273 -The First PartOl sonf vorsg, goho Iad balt lansh calzvonpho Sobra zol ror i ta Nazpsad Graata Malprg Ds hol q Qaa nothoa zimz odcommah ta nobloh zien Soba thil gnonpprge aldi Ds urbs oboleh grsam.

New office buildings’excavations regularly encounter spectral ships intheir basements.B. The Black HouseThere was a house in the great Metropoliswhich was older than the town. Many said that itwas older, even, than the cathedral, and, before theArchangel Michael raised his voice as advocate inthe conflict for God, the house stood there in itsevil gloom, defying the cathedral from out its dulleyes. It had lived through the time of smoke andsoot. Every year which passed over the city seemedto creep, when dying, into this house, so that, at- 319 -last it was a cemetery - a coffin, filled with deadtens of years.Set into the black wood of the door stood,copper-red, mysterious, the seal of Satan, thepentagram.It was said that a magician, who came fromthe East (and in the track of whom the plaguewandered), had built the house in seven nights.But the masons and carpenters of the towndid not know who had mortared the bricks, norwho had erected the roof. No foreman’s speechand no ribboned nosegay had hallowed theBuilder’s Feast after the pious custom.The chronicles of the town held no record ofwhen the magician died, nor of how he died.One day it occurred to the citizens as oddthat the red shoes of the magician had so longshunned the abominable plaster of the town.Entrance was forced into the house and nota living soul was found inside. But the rooms,which received, neither by day nor by night, a rayfrom the great lights of the sky, seemed to bewaiting for their master, sunken in sleep.Parchments and folios lay about, open,under a covering of dust, like silver-grey velvet.Set in all the doors stood, copper-red,mysterious, the seal of Satan, the pentagram. 161San Francisco’s Richmond District is “way outthere”, sitting next to the Pacific Ocean, nestledbetween the Presidio to the north and Golden GatePark to the south. In contrast to the city’s various“spectacular” neighborhoods, the Richmond isplacid and peaceful: trim and tidy residences with aRussian émigré accent of golden-turnip-toppedEastern Orthodox churches. Until 1966 Richmond’sonly claim to weirdness was its “Land’s End”161 von Harbour, Thea, Metropolis. New York: Ace Books, 1927,page #47.

Decades later, when the cluband its Wurlitzer had given way to a restaurant,nostalgic patrons would point out the ghostlyceiling-relief of the organ dais, and regalecompanions with I-knew-him-when-he-had-hair162 6114 California Street Grant Deed, Michael J.

Some might even recall Anton’s signaturefinale, the love-song “Yankee Rose”. 163Otherwise, until Satan inaugurated his Earthlyembassy at 6114, the LaVeys were just like any otherrespectable family with two daughters and a lion. 164But once they started a church that didn’tsport a turnip-top, other Richmonders weren’t quiteso sure. Remarked one lady neighbor in the 1969documentary film Satanis:Actually I don’t know what kind of man heis. His appearance is very nice. He makes a verygood impression. He has a very soft voice, and hetalks so smooth, so pleasant. As soon as you meethim, you think he is a very, very nice man.But there is definitely something goingwrong over there. I just have a feeling I can’ttrust him.There are women there who are withoutclothes - naked. And the men wear a - a kind ofblack hooded robe.And sometimes from my window I can see akind of red light and silhouettes like devils. Andone silhouette, a big one - maybe it’s him,standing over the whole crowd and preaching.A comprehensive 6114 tour is beyond the scopeof this book; for that see my The Church of Satan.Here some vignettes may suffice:Past the front door visitors would need tonegotiate a black hallway guarded by a sentry-163 This same “signature” appeared mysteriously as the “finalé”of the original Satanic Bible, with Satanists worldwide puzzlingover its esotericism as a Barbarous Evocation.164 Togare arrived as a cute little cub, retiring to Tippi Hedren’sShambala great cat sanctuary near Los Angeles when as a 500-lb adult his nocturnal roars kept the neighbors awake.

Alongside sat a period Rock-Ola 45rpm vinyl jukebox.Trough a concealed door from the Den was6114’s most secret and exclusive venue for magicalworkings, the “Council Chamber” (named for theChurch’s Council of Nine). Restricted to Antonalone, or with one or two participants, it was alsorigged with various electromagnetic mechanisms.Through a visible door at the back of the Den’sbar was what had originally been called the BlueRoom. Painted in bewildering iridescence, itsinterior was a forest of mirrors surrounding a raisedplatform on which there rested an open trapezoidal166 Nathaniel West’s savage 1939 novel about the “Boulevard ofBroken Dreams” human tragedies of peripheral Hollywood.167 Wearing a commercial rubber Devil mask modeled fromAnton LaVey’s features.- 326 -coffin: rarely used because of its obviouspsychological dangers.By 1973 the Blue Room had been changed tosomething radically different, if not dangerous in adifferent way. Now it appeared as a seedy hotelroom with old, cheap furniture; a “light-boxwindow” showed a dark alley with a fitfully-flickering neon sign for the flophouse. Hanginginside the door was Anton’s collection of famousfemale movie stars’ “unmentionables”.There remains to disclose only the darkest andmost terrifying secret of the Black House: one sounnerving that I strongly suspect Anton never toldDiane, Karla, or Zeena about it so as not to afflictthem with frightful nightmares. 168It had to do with an obscure, locked third dooron the east wall of the Den of Iniquity.As far as family and aides such as John Ferroknew, this just led to a tiny utility room that servedonly two purposes: Anton’s hideaway desk & files;and the ladder to the Purple Room’s fireplace.It was here that Anton kept the strongboxcontaining his personal Pact with Satan, as well asitems he did not trust to his formal Red Room officeor the bookshelves of the Purple Room, such as hisfirst edition of The King in Yellow.But there was something else in that alcove.One evening in early 1975, Anton and I hadbeen discussing H.P. Lovecraft’s novel The Case ofCharles Dexter Ward, notable for an ordinary NewEngland farmhouse concealing a warren of168 It may also have been the reason Anton’s father left 6114with his wife, though apparently unable to convince his son toabandon it as well. By 1971 Joseph apparently decided thatAnton had deterred any immediate danger.[index-327_1.jpg][index-327_2.jpg]- 327 -underground tunnels and caverns with the usualHPL horrors lurking therein.“How much do you know about this part of SanFrancisco?” asked my host, then led the way fromthe Purple Room through the bookcase to the RedRoom, thence into the mummy-case concealing theladder down into the Den of Iniquity.Anton unlocked the alcove door, and we wentinside, where he pulled up the carpet on the roughcement floor, revealing an obviously very old ironmanhole-cover:Without touching it, Anton replaced the rug.Shortly before his parents had moved out, he said,his father had shown him this feature in whatoriginally was just unfinished basement crawlspace.Young Tony had been told just to leave it alone,which he did.Years later, when remodeling the house to itspresent exotica, he’d come across it again whileconstructing the Purple Room’s fireplace-ladder. Heopened it, revealing a vertical tunnel of utterdarkness beneath. There was no ladder or theremains of one, and a flashlight beam was not strongenough to illuminate its lower terminus. He’d thenreplaced the iron lid and hadn’t disturbed it since.[index-328_1.jpg]- 328 -From a drawer of the alcove’s desk, Antonretrieved a document. Back in the Purple Room hespread it out on the tombstone-coffeetable.“This is the storm-drain network beneath theRichmond District, Sea Cliff, and Land’s End. Afterthe 1906 Earthquake and Fire, there was a great dealof engineering effort put into the city’s water-supplyand -drainage systems. Apparently the old NorthBeach and Financial Districts just needed repairs totheir existing networks, but out in the Avenues,Sunset, and Richmond there was major excavation.“As best I can determine from these old charts,6114’s sitting slightly off-center above the mainstorm-drain artery, a gigantic spillway called the‘Mile Rock Tunnel’. It’s about 300 feet down andseveral thousand feet long, ending in the Land’s Endcrags below the Sutro Baths.“A great many tributaries, both planned and‘encountered’, were connected to Mile Rock.[index-329_1.png][index-329_2.png]- 329 -“So this entire district is sitting over a labyrinththat would put Lovecraft to shame.“I think it’s obvious that the pit below thishouse is one of those, if not part of Mile Rock itself.“In the Chronicle archives,” - he producedanother paper from the desk - “I found just this oneold photo of it before it was sealed off from sight:“The main tunnel was so huge that theengineers celebrated its completion by driving a carthrough it all the way to the cliffs. Ironically they’dforgotten there was no place to turn around, so thecar had then to reverse all the way back.“But this certainly solves the mystery of thegigantic sinkholes that have regularly plagued thisdistrict during severe storms: various collapses ofthe tributaries. I hate to think what might happen ifthe main tunnel beneath this house ever experiencesa whole or even partial collapse. Look at this photofrom the last such sinkhole, just a few blocks away:[index-330_1.jpg][index-330_2.jpg]- 330 -“Judging from the bewilderment at such times,I don’t think anyone but myself knows the existenceor extent of the abandoned subterra, else they’d beterrified to live here. And it also lays bare theblighted devastation haunting the ruins of the SutroBaths.” 169Anton paused, pulled a moldering volume fromthe highest corner of the bookshelf. Its cover seemedto be some sort of aged leather or skin, crudelybranded or burned on the front only:al-AzifI knew immediately with a thrill of shockedincredulity that it was indeed the abhorredNecronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred ...but it was well-known that this terrible tome was169 Concerning the Sutro Baths, see Appendix #3 of my GhostRides (2018), in which Eric Kauschen examines theircatastrophic fate, and relates how he and a fellow spelunkernearly didn’t survive an exploration of one of the now-sealedburrows beneath those spectral ruins. Do not venture therein!- 331 -merely a whimsical invention by Lovecraft. So howon Earth [or out of it] could Anton LaVey possiblypossess it?!Undeterred, indeed apparently driven by somesubtle madness emanating from the iron-sealedchasm below us, my host feverishly pawed throughthe disintegrating pages, then intoned in a voicealternately maniacally triumphant and quaveringlyhysterical:“The nethermost caverns are not for thefathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels arestrange and terrific.“Cursed the ground where dead thoughtslive new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind thatis held by no head.“Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy isthe tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy thetown at night whose wizards are all ashes. For it isof old rumour that the soul of the devil-boughthastes not from his charnel clay, but fats andinstructs the very worm that gnaws; till out ofcorruption horrid life springs, and the dullscavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swellmonstrous to plague it.“Great holes secretly are digged whereearth’s pores ought to suffice, and things havelearnt to walk that ought to crawl.” 170Anton slammed that blasphemous book closedand stared wild-eyed into the Infinity Mirror acrossthe room; innumerable metaphysical monstrositiesglared and gibbered mockingly back at him as I ranshrieking mindlessly from that hideous house andthe labyrinthian loathsomeness biding beneath.I recall naught else of that noxious night -170 al-Hazred, Abdul, Al Azif (“the Necronomicon”), rashlyreproduced by H.P.

I was finally subdued by several taser-shots and gentle mauling by a K-9 wooficer.Then came a time which pulled downantiquities. Then the words were spoken: Thehouse must die.But the house was stronger than the words,as it was stronger than the centuries. Withsuddenly-falling stones it slew those who laidhands on its walls. It opened the floor under theirfeet, dragging them down into a shaft, of which noman had previously had any knowledge.It was as though the plague, which hadformerly wandered in the wake of the red shoes ofthe magician, still crouched in the corners of thenarrow house, springing out at men from behind,to seize them by the neck. They died, and nodoctor knew the illness.The house resisted its destruction with sogreat a force that word of its malignity went outover the borders of the city, spreading far over theland, that, at last, there was no honest man to befound who would have ventured to make waragainst it.Yes, even the thieves and the rogues, whowere promised remission of their sentenceprovided that they declared themselves ready topull down the magician’s house, preferred to go tothe pillory, or even to the scaffold, rather than toenter within these spiteful walls, these latchlessd o o r s , w h i c h w e r e s e a l e d w i t h S a t a n ’ spentagram. 171171 von Harbou, op.cit. , page #48.[index-333_1.jpg][index-333_2.jpg]- 333 -Over the next score of years the house endured,gradually falling into disrepair after first Diane, thenAnton LaVey abandoned it. Finally it was pastrestoration: As the commercial firm acquiring theproperty put it, “That house is just held up by thebuildings on both sides.”6114 California Street ended its existence,impudently enough, on my birthday, October16th, in the year 2001.The newspapers ignorantly assumed andreported that it had been a routine demolition, butthey had not been there just after mid-night to hear- as incredulous neighbors later put it - that obscenesucking sound as the black spectre shuddered, thencollapsed horrifyingly inward, until nothingremained but a small, pulsing Darkness adjacent toa flung-aside circlet of cold iron. A Mr. FredFarnsworth, visiting friends at 6135 California, tookthe only known photograph, though he was quicklyaccused of faking it:The inexplicably-sheered lot was immediatelyconcealed for months behind a hastily-erectedchainlink fence, behind which the weeds and bushesovergrew with certain peculiar mutations asglimpsed through cracks in the slatted fencing.- 334 -A year later Lilith and I were invited to theopen house-showing of the condominiums whichhad been built on the site.For reasons the agents could [or, moreprobably, would] not explain, it was now named“611[]” - not “6114”. It appeared that the Other Godshad decreed that not only the original structure, buteven its very address, should cease ever to havebeen.I was somehow not surprised to see that thenew building also had no excavated basement, butrested on a freshly-poured, curiously thicker cementslab. The ground-level area previously containingthe alcove and its surrounds was now a large,ordinary recreation room. There was no sign of theiron lid.It was only then, reassuringly convinced by thesoothing banality of the condominiums, that I couldfinally put those mocking memories of that terriblenight to rest.Well, almost. One thing persists in vaguelydisquieting my last glimpse of Anton LaVey as I randesperately for the door.He had no business laughing while hescreamed.... And travellers now within that valley,Through the red-litten windows seeVast forms that move fantasticallyTo a discordant melody;While, like a rapid ghastly river,Through the pale door;A hideous throng rush out forever,And laugh - but smile no more.- Edgar Allan PoeThe Fall of the House of Usher[index-335_1.jpg]- 335 -18: Ninth SolsticeArise! Hear! See with the brilliance of myFlame that has been brought before mydarkened and blasted temple these longyears. I am Satan, and again the greatangles of the Universe are conjoined that Imay manifest my Will to this plane of Earth. Ihave constrained the forces of time that Imay do this, yet even so I am not full masterof inertia, as the Cosmos is not entirely athing of my creation.I and the High Daimons of Infernus - that isHell - have looked upon the workings of myEarthly Church with pleasure and the pridethat is our nectar. And we too have drawnlife afresh from this Church. Did I not saythat we had chosen to invest man with ourown life essence - that which, being not ofthe natural order of things, we cannotrecreate from other matter? In giving manconscious life, we of the Daimonic raceempowered him to order our death. HadSatan’s Gift been cast aside - whether fromignorance or from fear - Satan himself andall who were wrought from him should face- 336 -decline and dissolution. Yet, had I chosen toretain the Flame inviolate in Hell, we Daimonsshould have become guardians of that verystasis we so greatly abhor. In this matter -where we first surmised the choice so great- there actually was none.The natural instincts compelling man backto a simple, bestial mode were so strong that- accented as they were by man’s distortedfear of my own motives - we eventuallyconsidered the prospects for our finaleclipse. But, while the Flame dimmed, itwould not be vanquished. Man denied me,yes. But, to the impotent and bewilderedfury of Heaven, this very conscious act wasmy true redemption and victory. Do youwonder that I so cherish irony? It hasbecome the most reliable of all my oracles.Much was spoken of the ways and wishes ofHell in our Diabolicon - that which wasbrought forth from Asia in the fifth year ofmy Age. Yet the Diabolicon warranted acertain obscurity of its own nonetheless.The method of its transmission was crude -the agent as yet untouched by theknowledge of my Priesthood. Only the eyesof him whom I had fashioned as a Maguslooked and saw. Even so I set for him manytasks before I should again speak in thisway.Hear, my anointed man, in whose mortalflesh I, Satan, have chosen to inspire mymaterial Self - into whose keeping I have- 337 -given my true Church - whom I have madeMagister within the Realm of my ShiningTrapezoid - whom I have incarnated as aMagus - Hear, now, Anton Szandor LaVey.Recall first the pact which, years ago, youdrew up before me, and to which you setyour own name. Think not that I have beenunmindful of that act long past, pale andlonely though it might seem beside thewreaths you have won from your own kind.You could not know but that you riskedmore than your life - yet you stretchedforth your Will through the darkness of theangles to seek mine. Though you havebrought many honors to me, never wasthere such as this.Take now the pact. In that chamber whichyou know to be most beloved of me, buildnow with your own hands a Flame that issacred to me. Let your hands pass throughthe Fire - once for each angle of my ShiningTrapezohedron. Speak again that great Keywhich suspends the barrier between Hell andEarth, that I may bear witness to that whichyou undertake in my name.Receive now my tribute. Our pact shall beconsumed in the Flame, and with this act Irelease you from your bond with me.Through your alliance with the Powers ofD a r k n e s s y o u h a v e b e e n g r a n t e dknowledge far beyond that normallyaccorded your race. And for this you havebeen manifest as a Magus. But now - of my- 338 -own Will and bound by no pact - I, Satan,bestow upon you my greatest gift - forwhich there is no degree in my Order.By my Will, Anton Szandor LaVey, you aredivest of your human substance andbecome in your Self a Daimon.Henceforth you are as a true god, and it isin your power to alter the machinery of theCosmos according to your desire. No chargedo I lay upon you, for you are now mybrother and no longer my liege. Butremember always the word we of Hell haveproclaimed. We need justify neither ourexistence nor our desires, but without aconsidered purpose - which Belial has setforth in the Diabolicon - both are withoutconsequence.For nine years my Church has shunned thedarkness and sought the light. Think notthat the trials set before it were eitherrandom misadventures or the schemes of anunknown adversary. All were authored byme, the more to illustrate the paralysis of theGod-churches. In truth they are engines ofself-annihilation in design as in doctrine.This I will never permit my Order to emulate.Those who honor the name of Satan haveexisted throughout the dim aeons of humanhistory, as is well known to you. Yet, untilyou assumed the degree of Magus, minewas the nameless Church. Now, for nineyears, my name has been heralded, and- 339 -those who were blind in the light havelearned that it is possible to see in darkness.My Age has begun, and I am come forth touphold my bond with mankind. Yet I shallnot illuminate all, nor even many - but a few.I seek the Elect, who in turn seek me. Manthe god shall arise only from the ashes ofman the beast - The blood is the life.High Priest - You have made my namebeloved. But a time approaches when I shallbe shunned and cursed as never before.This matters not, for the Elect will have seenmy truth. But my Church must survive, andto survive in fact, it must vanish in fiction.Out of the great darkness I have come, andinto the darkness I and my Order shall againventure. Therein lies the future. Those whochoose the solace of the known will berewarded with death.Let the institutions of the Church of Satanbe discarded. Their time is past, and theyhave served my purpose honorably. Seeknow the Elect, as the darkness draws near.No longer shall all who approach my Churchfind welcome - They shall grasp at empty air.Only the Elect shall find what they seek.More shall now be said.Hail, Daimon! Receive now the Red Halo, andknow thereby that you are become the RedMagus of whom Leviathan has spoken.- 340 -[index-341_1.jpg]- 341 -- 342 -[index-343_1.jpg][index-343_2.png]- 343 -- 344 -[index-345_1.jpg]- 345 -Afterword- by Stanton Zaharoff LaVeyI appreciate the invitation to contribute thisAfterword, particularly considering who Michael gotto do the Foreword.I was not surprised that my grandfather hadintentions of eventually revising the Satanic Bible tobe a more harmonious companion to his SatanicRituals. When co-authoring and -editing the Bible in1968, he and my grandmother simply had not hadthe leisure and experience with the new Church ofSatan which they would have three years later forthe Rituals. Unfortunately he did not have theopportunity to reconsider and revise the Bibleduring his later years.I don’t know how the Satanic Bible might havebeen reworked by my grandfather, but I do knowthat he and Michael Aquino saw eye-to-eye on thenew 1972 Introduction, so I think it’s a good bet thatif they had further collaborated on the book, it mighthave come out very much like this “ReVision” byMichael - bearing always in mind that “history doesnot reveal its alternatives” in both interests andexperiences.I agree with Michael’s position that “ReVision”does not mean “replacement”. The 1968 original has- 346 -established its place in history, and certainly servedits purpose as a “tangible testament” of Satanism asa sincere, legitimate religion. The “public footprint”that the Church itself created as an organization, theSatanic Bible did as a publication. Its mere title wasdefinitely a “tack on the chair” of the world’sconventional religions.So on this occasion of its Golden Anniversary, Ithink it is indeed a suitable moment for the SatanicBible to be honored and enhanced by this ReVision.If anyone can carry something like this off, it’sclearly Michael, who has amply demonstrated thathe can don the old sorcerer’s hat without beingdrowned by a bucket brigade of brooms.And I don’t mind saying that I knew mygrandfather pretty well, and I think that he will nodwith sardonic satisfaction when @amazon.hedelivers his complimentary copy.As for human readers still on this side of whatMichael calls “the Big Black Sack”, you just mightfind that it’s not inescapably your fate after all.I will but add my emphasis and caution to whatthis tome teaches of consecrating one’s curiosity byutterance of a personal Oath, as I indeed deemfitting to conclude this Afterword:All hail to ye, Dæmonic Denizens of the Abyssof Wonder and Woe:- 347 -I, Stanton Zaharoff LaVey, seek to present myallegiance and adoration to Him who sits on thePeacock Throne of Pandemonium. Pray thereforepass me in warmth and welcome.And now in thy court and presence: O Satan, whoseradiance is that of the Morning Star, who sees allfrom the cataclysmic clash of galaxies to the dew-mists upon a single rose, from whom the whispersof subtle subconsciousness are as known as theboldest battle-cry:I stand before you but to reaffirm my Oath andallegiance to the Quest to which all in your fane arecalled. I seek the mysteries of my souls to whichyou have opened so many marvelous and terribledoors, and I shall not quail upon advance throughthem, confident that upon emergence I shall revel inwhat I have further beheld and become.Pray therefore regard me ever in your favor andfriendship, and through me work your magic uponthose still asleep, that their wakening may be aswondrous to them in all their ways and worlds.The first words I remember shall be the last I utter.And So It It is Said and Done.Rege Satanas!Stanton Z.

Flowers, Ph.D.Immediately following the original SatanicBible’s dedication to his wife and High PriestessDiane, Anton LaVey included a “To:” page listingpersonages inspirational to his writing of the book.It is reproduced herein as page #37.Beyond brief, cryptic comments concerningthe principal listees, Anton did not elaborate onthem, including in the Church of Satan’s ClovenHoof throughout the decade of the Church’sexistence.In 1997 Dr. Flowers researched thesepersonalities for his book Lords of the Left-HandPath172. It follows immediately below, for whichhis permission is acknowledged and appreciated. -M.A.A.Essential to the nature of the myth of anyfigure such as Anton LaVey are the influences whichshaped that figure’s thought and action. LaVeyhimself provided a core list of such influences on histhought on the dedication page of the originalprintings of his Satanic Bible.172 Flowers, Stephen E. Ph.D., Lords of the Left-Hand Path.Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions, 1997.- 352 -It is telling that in more recent printings of thebook this page has been omitted.On that list appear 19 primary personages, with20 more given a sort of “honorable mention”. Thereis also one animal, Togare, LaVey’s famous pet lion,and the Nine Unknown Men.Almost 70 other names appeared in a similarlist in his Satanic Rituals book. These too have beenremoved in recent printings.Space does not permit me to discuss each oneof these personages in any detail, but the primarylist is extremely important to understanding LaVey’sSatanic philosophy.The 19 primary men are (in the order he listedthem): Bernardino Logara, Karl Haushofer, GrigoryYefimovitch Rasputin, Sir Basil Zaharoff, AllesandroCagliostro, Barnabas Saul, Ragnar Redbeard,William Mortensen, Hans Brick, Max Reinhardt,Orrin Klapp, Fritz Lang, Friedrich Nietzsche,William Claude Dukinfield, Phineas Taylor Barnum,Hans Poelzig, Reginald Marsh, Wilhelm Reich, andMark Twain.After the names of each of these, LaVeycharacterizes them with a dedicatory phrase. Theseare given in quotation marks in the discussionsbelow:Bernadino Nogara, “who knew the value ofmoney”, oversaw the modernization of the VaticanBank from 1929 to 1954. [Misprinted “Logara”.]Karl Haushofer (1869-1946), “a teacherwithout a classroom”, was the founder of the theoryof “geopolitics” and a professor of geography at theUniversity of Munich. He was sympathetic with- 353 -National Socialism and exerted influence on itsideology, especially through one of his students,Rudolf Hess. However LaVey’s image andadmiration of him comes through the modemmythologizing contained in The Morning of theMagicians, in which the authors have Haushoferinvolved in various occult goings-on in Tibet andwith the infamous Thule Gesellschaft of Rudolf vonSebottendorf. There is, however, no evidence forthese more “occultnik” connections.Rasputin (1872-1916), “who knew the magicof a child”, was much admired by LaVey because hesaw the Russian “mad monk” as a lusty manipulatorof people (especially women) and power - all traitspursued by LaVey himself. But Rasputin was notlikely to have had anything really “Satanic” abouthim. LaVey was most certainly inspired by morelurid accounts of Rasputin - and by the filmRasputin: The Mad Monk (Hammer, 1965).Sir Basil Zaharoff (1850-1936), “agentleman”, was an arms merchant who soldweaponry and encouraged his customers to use theirpurchases - all while not only becoming wealthy butbeing knighted by the King of England too!Cagliostro (1743-1791), “a rogue”, was theassumed name of an Italian magician and alchemistnamed Guiseppe Balsamo. He billed himself as a“Count” and the “Grand Kophta of the EgyptianLodge”, but what was less known was that he hadbeen expelled from several countries due to hisfraudulent dealings. He was popular with the peopleand a supporter of revolution, but ended his life inthe dungeons of Pope Pius VI.- 354 -Barnabas Saul was the first “scryer”, ormedium, employed by the Elizabethan mage JohnDee (1527-1608). After leaving Dee’s service, Sauldisavowed his visions.Ragnar Redbeard (1842?-1926?), “whosemight is right”, is a story unto himself. “Redbeard”was perhaps the pseudonym of Arthur Desmond, anatheist and social Darwinist street-philosopher fromwhose book, entitled Might is Right, LaVey liftedwhole sections to create the “Book of Satan” portionof the Satanic Bible.William Mortensen, “who looked ... andsaw”, wrote a photographers’ manual entitled TheCommand to Look (1937). The psycho-opticaltheories contained in it greatly influenced LaVey’sapproach to art and to images and the way they caninfluence the human mind. It must be considered akeystone to LaVeyan Satanism.Hans Brick, “who knows the law”, wrote abook entitled The Nature of the Beast (1960), whichwas a formative influence on the formulation ofLaVey’s social philosophy, especially as contained inthe Lex Talonis or “Eleven Rules of the Earth”.Max Reinhardt (1873-1943), “a builder ofdreams”, was born Max Goldman in Austria andbecame famous as a theatrical director whospecialized in staging huge spectacles.Orrin Klapp (b. 1915), “the walking man”, is asociologist whose works Heroes, Villains and Fools(1962) and The Collective Search for Identity (1969)- 355 -were greatly influential on LaVey’s ideas of socialmovements and change.Fritz Lang (1890-1976), “who made movingblueprints”, was an Austrian film director who madesuch classics as Metropolis (1926) and M (1930).Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), “a realist”,was a German philosopher and forerunner to theexistentialists. His ideas of the overman (or“superman”) and the “will to power”, as well as hisideas concerning the existence of natural “masters”and ”slaves”, are greatly admired by modernphilosophical Satanists.W.C. Fields (1880-1946), “who saved me ajourney to Tibet”, was the stage-name of William C.Dukinfield.P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), “another greatguru”, was the American showman famous for hisexhibits of freaks and establishment of circuses.Barnum’s supposed basic philosophy - “There’s asucker born every minute.” - was taken to heart byLaVey and used as a mainstay of his worldview.Hans Poelzig (1869-1936), “who knew all theangles”, was a German architect who specialized ingrandiose and imaginative structures. An example isthe Grand Theater in Berlin, also called the MaxReinhardt Theater (1919). He was also the setdesigner for The Golem (Deutsche Bioscop, 1914).Reginald Marsh (1898-1954), “a great artist”,was an illustrator, scene designer, and painter of- 356 -gritty street scenes, greatly admired by LaVey, whois himself a painter of unusual subjects.Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), “who knewmore than cabinet making”, was a Germanpsychologist who held that there was a materialforce called “orgone” which worked in conjunctionwith the human orgasm. This force could also becollected in “cabinets” called “orgone accumulators”.Mark Twain (1835-1910), “a very brave man”,was the pen name of Samuel Langhorn Clemens, thegreat American writer. LaVey much admires Twainfor his works Letters from the Earth (1962) and TheMysterious Stranger (1969). In an early Church ofSatan document, LaVey praises Twain as “one of thegreatest of the Devil’s advocates in history” and as“the most noble embodiment of the Satanist”.This list of influences provides invaluableinsight into the formation of LaVey’s philosophy andoutlook on life. Of the 16 identifiable men fully halfof them are artists of one kind or another. Of these,five dealt with the creation of visual imagery andtwo, W.C. Fields and P.T. Barnum, were best knownas “trickster” figures. The idealization of imagemakers should provide some clue as to the truenature of LaVey’s philosophy and magic.That most of LaVey’s ideas are not original, andthat his philosophy is largely made up of bits andpieces of the philosophies of others which herecomposed according to his own tastes and style -unique to himself and to his time - might also besaid of some of the other subjects in Lords of theLeft-Hand Path. We could say the same of every one- 357 -who ever created a religion, whether Gautama theBuddha or Gerald Gardner.What makes LaVey somewhat unusual in thisrespect is that he often seems to insist on the ideathat he invented a way of thinking, that his Satanismis something akin to a product upon which he has a“copyright” of some sort.But more remarkable than the idea that LaVeyinvented his Satanism out of bits and pieces ofobscure philosophies is the fact that he actuallyinvented himself out of the depths of his ownmind.- 358 -[index-359_1.jpg]- 359 -A2: Satanic Bible1972 Introduction- by Michael A. Aquino IV°-I’Each successive era of man’s cultural andethical development has upraised its literarymanifesto - an argument challenging existing normsand proposing a novel approach to the enduringissues of civilization. It has not infrequently been thecase that the realities of political nationalism havebeen blended with the idealisms of extranationalemphasis to produce what we now cautiously termexistentialism. Pertinent works might include theRepublic of Plato, the Politics of Aristotle,Machiavelli’s Prince, and the writings of Nietzsche,Hobbes, Locke, Marx, and Sartre.This is the book of our era.The dawn of the Satanic Age was celebrated onApril 30, 1966 - the Year One. On that date AntonSzandor LaVey consecrated the Church of Satan inthe city of San Francisco and assumed office as itsfirst High Priest. What had begun several yearsearlier as an intellectual forum dedicated to theinvestigation and application of the Black Arts hassince expanded into an international philosophical- 360 -movement of the first magnitude. Satanism, oncethe isolate province of furtive outcasts and radicaleccentrics, has now become a serious alternative tothe doctrines of theism and materialism. In itschampionship of “indulgence instead of abstinence”,the Church of Satan rejects the notion that man’sprogress is contingent upon his acceptance of a self-imposed morality. Sound judgment derives from thecomparison and resolution of opposites, Satanistsmaintain, and one cannot presume to justice byhonoring a single standard of behavior.An empirical approach to morality is not arecent innovation; such theorists as Pythagoras,Hegel, Spencer, and Compte advanced the originalpropositions for man’s intellectual independencefrom the natural order. And, though this concept hasinvariably provoked adverse reaction from society-oriented institutions, it is not an insubstantialviewpoint. One need only consider the spasmodiccataclysms of history to see how inadequately HomoSapiens cooperates with his fellows.By itself, however, all theory is inconsequential.Until now the only advocates of a subjectivemorality were professorial abstractionists and -occasionally - the scattered and disorganizeddevotees of the traditional “White” witchcraft.Indeed the latter have enjoyed some notoriety oflate, as their supposed proclamation of a liberalmorality tempered by social correctness appeals tothe bored but timid dilettante. Such aficionados ofthe occult profess a righteous horror of Black Magicor Satanism, which they denounce as a maleficent,degenerate creature of moral and carnal abuse.The Satanist, on the other hand, regardstraditional witchcraft as merely a neurotic reactionagainst the established religions of the parent- 361 -culture. The worship of any deity or deities - underany guise whatsoever - is repulsive to the BlackMagician, who considers all protestations of faith ortrust in a supernatural protectorate to behumiliating demonstrations of cowardice andemotional insecurity. Satanism has been frequentlymisrepresented as “devil worship”, when in fact itconstitutes a clear rejection of all forms of worshipas a desirable component of the personality. It is notso much an anti-religion - a simple rebuttal of anyo n e b e l i e f - a s i t i s a n u n - r e l i g i o n , a nuncompromising dismissal of all insubstantialmysticism. As such it represents a far more seriousthreat to organized theologies than do the archaiccustoms of the old dæmonologies.Ritual and fantasy play a very real part in theactivities of the Satanic Church, on the assumptionthat the experience and control of mental andmetaphysical irrationality are necessary for thestrengthening of the psyche. Thus a distinct effort ismade to avoid what was perhaps the Achilles’ heel ofthe Gurdjieff-Ouspensky school of subjectivepsychological evolution; earlier disciples of self-determined transcendentalism postulated that allnon-materialistic sensations were a danger to thecoherence of the student. Crucial to the concept ofSatanic ritual is an appreciation of its illustrativeand inspirational qualities without necessarilyregarding it as inflexible reality.Satanism is more accurately identified as adisposition than as a religion, as it is activelyconcerned with all the facets of human existence,not with only the so-called spiritual aspects. Yetthose who proclaim it to be a danger to justice andcooperative order have missed the point entirely.Satanism advocates unrestricted freedom, but only- 362 -to the extent that one’s preferences do not impingeupon another’s. It should also be noted thatSatanism is a philosophy of the individual, not of themass. There are no collective policy statements savethe famous Crowley admonition: “Self-deceit is thegravest of all ‘sins’.”While the majority of the populace mayinstinctively incline to a de facto Satanism, theChurch cautions that its propositions are not for theirresponsible. There are no Satanic missionaries,and to affiliate one must meet exacting standards.Inexperience is not dishonored, but pretentiousness,hypocrisy, and pomposity are treated with the scornthat they deserve. Satanism is no less an art than itis a science, and there is “no standard ofmeasurement deified”.Dr. LaVey is uniquely prepared to author thenew Diabolism. An American of Georgian, Alsatian,and Romanian Gypsy descent, he was quick todisplay the characteristic restlessness of his nomadicancestors and an unusual empathy for their earthy,arcane lore. An early preoccupation with themilitary sciences led him to read the variouslogistical publications of the World War II era, onlyto discover that the proud visions of martial gloryentertained in the first world war had given way to adetached, mercenary realism in the second. Hisexperiences as a student did nothing to dispel thisfirst taste of human cynicism, and LaVey’s growingimpatience with the sterile regimentation ofconventional education drove him to seek thestrange, surrealistic enchantments of the circus. Heassisted Clyde Beatty as a wild-animal trainer, andhe soon developed a strong affinity for the catswhich was to mark his personality in a most curiousmanner. All animate creatures are basically bestial,- 363 -he reasoned, and even the most refined social ordersachieve at best only a flimsy suppression of thisinnate savagery. From the circus he proceeded to acarnival, where the glitter of the performing arts wastinged with the ever-present struggle for dailysubsistence. Here LaVey worked in a pathetic butquietly dignified world of misfits, sideshow freaks,and human oddities; and here he was to learn thecraft of the stage magician, whose success dependsupon the contrived distraction of the audience’sattention. With a certain grimness he noted thefascination with which the “normal” man regards hisdeformed comrades - a gloating satisfaction over thevisiting of misfortune upon another instead ofoneself. Becoming increasingly interested in thiscruel, lycanthropic attribute of human nature, hestudied criminology in college and eventuallyworked with the San Francisco Police Department asa photographer.As a circus professional he had seen carnal manat his most artistic; now he was to view him at hismost vicious. Three years of the gore, brutality, andabject misery that permeate the criminal subcultureleft him sickened, disillusioned, and angered withthe rampant hypocrisy of polite society. He turnedto the pipe organ as a means of living and devotedthe greater part of his efforts to what was to becomehis life’s work - Black Magic.LaVey had long since rejected the stereotypicaltracts on ceremonial sorcery as the hystericalproducts of medieval imaginations. The “Old Craft”with its superstitions, affected mannerisms, andinfantile parlor games was not for him; what hesought was a metaphysical psychology that wouldapproach the intellectual man only after giving due- 364 -consideration to his brutal, animalistic origins. Andso he came at last to the Goat of Mendes.Satan is easily the most enigmatic figure inclassical literature. Possessed of every conceivablewealth, and the most powerful of the Archangels, hespurned his exalted allegiance to proclaim hisindependence from all that his Heavenly patronpersonified. Although condemned to the mosthideous of domains, a Hell totally shunned by thedivinity, he embraced such privations as the burdenof his intellectual prerogative. In his InfernalEmpire one might indulge even the mostextraordinary tastes with impunity, yet amidst suchwanton licentiousness the Devil maintained apeculiar nobility. It was this elusive quality whichAnton LaVey determined to identify.After long years of research and experiment, hepronounced the guiding principle of Satanism: thatthe ultimate consequence of man lies not in unitybut in duality. It is only synthesis that decidesvalues; adherence to a single order is arbitrary andtherefore insignificant.LaVey’s disturbing theories and bizarreoperations of ceremonial Black Magic eventuallyattracted a following of similarly mindedindividuals. From this first small circle the Churchof Satan was to emerge, attuned to its founder’scontention that its messages would be presentedmost effectively through “nine parts socialrespectability to one part of the most blatantoutrage”.The social impact and spectacular growth ofthe Church were to become something of a legend inthemselves, but it was an essential part of LaVey’sconvictions that the formal institution’s role wasprincipally that of a catalyst. Contemporary- 365 -civilization has proved too interdependent to permitthe luxury of monastic isolationism. Satanism mustaccordingly assume a stance comprehensible to theaverage intellect. It was with such intent that theSatanic Bible was conceived.The Satanic Bible is a most insidiousdocument. One is strongly tempted to compare itwith that obscure, malefic mythology The King inYellow, a psychopolitical work that supposedlydrove its readers to madness and damnation. Ascandid and conversational as the Satanic Biblemight seem at first glance, it is not a volume to begently dismissed. It is very much the product of ourtime, not only because such a book - together withits author - would more than likely have beendestroyed in an earlier era, but because its creationwas an evolutionary inevitability.You, the reader, are about to be impaled uponthe sharp horns of a Satanic dilemma. If you acceptthe propositions of this book, you condemn yourmost cherished sanctuaries to annihilation. Inreturn you will awaken - but only to the most fiery ofHells. Should you reject the argument, you resignyourself to a cancerous disintegration of yourpreviously subconscious sense of identity. Smallwonder that the Archfiend’s legacy has won him somany bitter enemies!Whatever your decision, it can be avoided nolonger. The Satanic Bible finally articulates whatman has instinctively dreaded to proclaim: that hehimself is potentially divine.- 366 -[index-367_1.jpg]- 367 -A3: Ceremony of Ordination tothe Priesthood of Mendes- by Michael A. Aquino IV°-I’[From 1966 to mid-1972 Church of Satanordinations to the Satanic Priesthood - thePriesthood of Mendes III° - were conducted at theCentral Grotto in San Francisco by High PriestAnton LaVey and personalized to each Priest orPriestess.As the Church grew to a nationwideinstitution, Anton asked me to compose aceremony that a Magister IV° could administer ondistant national, regional, & local occasions.This ceremony was first conducted at the“Bramford” (Dakota) on Halloween during the 2ndEastern Conclave, New York City. It remained theofficial formalization until the cessation of theinitiatory Priesthood in June 1975.]The Sentinels of the Abyss aresummoned to enfold these chambers in asuspension of time and dimension, forthe Great Flame of the Prince ofDarkness is to be drawn to our midst.- 368 -As the Minions of Hell are convoked aswitness, I charge ye to suffer no wordof these proceedings to be passed tothe profane. Yea, the unseen ones ripasunder the flesh of those who wouldpresume against Our Lord Satan, and hemay not be provoked with impunity.Hear now the legacy of the Order ofthe Trapezoid.In the Diabolicon of the High Daimons ofHell is recounted the first great warof the Seraphim, wherein Lucifer andMasleh forced the universal opposition.From that epoch the entire cosmos hasknown the power of both stasis andchange.A n d E a r t h - c r e a t e d f o r t h epreservation and glory of all that wasGod - it was to Earth that Satan camein aeons past, to infuse the minds ofthe first men with the awareness ofself. Since that day of the coming ofthe Fire, the story of the race of manhas been as that of the universe - tornand tortured by war, famine, pestilence,and death. Yet in the midst of deathwe are in life - by the Gift of Satanwe are become gods of our selves.By Satan was charged the High DaimonBelial to entrust the care of the- 369 -Flame of Infernus to an Order of theElect. And Belial brought to this Orderthe great Keys to the Shining Trapezoidthat is the Gate to the Abyss, saying:Herein lies the geometric inspirationfor the existence of our lord Satan,who is Lucifer, Lord of Light andArchDaimon of Infernus. Observethat it doth shape and define theinverse pentagram, which is itselfour seal and the key to all beautyof proportion.Even as the triangle and trihedronsymbolize the selfless labor ofmen-beasts to support the apex -the throne of God - so we castdown and destroy that apex. Thuswe create our ensigns - theT r a p e z o i d a n d t h e S h i n i n gTrapezohedron, which are the ever-u n f i n i s h e d m e m o r i a l s t o t h ecreative genius of man. In the firstcivilizations of Earth our monumentsshall be uplifted, yet with thepassage of time they shall bechanged and effaced, and theirorigin clouded.But this Order shall endure untilthe race of man shall cease, andthose who enter its fold shallbehold the heart of the Fire, and- 370 -they shall gaze upon the face ofthe ArchDaimon. Yea, nevermoreshall they know peace, but theireyes shall be opened, and theyshall become as Daimons, and theforces of all creation shall bendbefore their will. So it shall bedone.These are the words of Belial, whomwe honor as the Guardian of the Flameand first Magus of the Infernal Empire.By his word we of the Black Orderhave rejected the lure of unity, thesubjugation of the cross, and theworship of the triad in all its formsand disguises.Embraced by the essence of the Fire ofLife, we scorn the pious antics ofsuperstition and abasement - these arebut pitiful endeavors to daunt theweak and the timid. A fool is he whoplaces his foot upon the Path to theRight - he has lain down for death. TheBlack Magus is master of all things -none holds power over him. By theforce of his person shall he vanquishall barriers erected before him. Hisword shall be as law, and the ring ofhis laughter shall dismay all theworshippers of false gods. And everbefore us shine the great Keys of theBond between Hell and Earth, and from- 371 -the Temple of the Ram shall comeforth the Eternal Serpent of theAbyss, beloved of our Order, who isthat called Leviathan.Advance to the altar of Hell, that theeye of Our Lord Satan may seize uponyou. As your mind is revealed to thelord of this world, do you affirm yourcause with Satan and accept of yourfree will his eternal Priesthood?[Response.]I bring your hand to that of Azazel,High Herald of the Infernal Empire,who shall set upon you the seal of thePriesthood of Mendes.[The black Baphomet medallion of the Priesthood ispassed through the Black Flame on the altar andplaced around the neck of the recipient.]In the name of Satan, and of his Exarchu p o n E a r t h , I n a m e y o u t o o u rfellowship and send you forth - beyondthe Abyss - to walk in ways ofstrangeness and of beauty.

Enigmatic EmblemThe emblem of the Church of Satan was whatwas formally called the “Sigil of Baphomet”. Itappeared above/behind altars as a plaque. Itappeared on the cover of the original Satanic Bible.It was also the visible identification of Churchmembers as a 2”-diameter silver metal medallionwith fire-enameled inlay in the color of theindividual’s initiatory degree.Since the “Bessy” version used by the Church ofSatan was in the public domain, commercialreproductions abound, from T-shirts to computergoatpads.Not to mention all through this book, in caseyou might forget its topic.With so many Bessys bouncing around, it’ssurprising how little most enthusiasts know about it:what it means, where the design ORIGINATED.B. Knights Templar & Éliphas LéviThe original Knights Templar were accused bytheir Catholic Inquisitors of having worshipped the[index-374_1.jpg][index-374_2.jpg][index-374_3.png][index-374_4.jpg]- 374 -Devil as a mysterious image or statue called“ B a p h o m e t ” ( s a i d t o b e a c o r r u p t i o n o f“Mohammed”). The absence of any actual suchstatue didn’t deter the Inquisitors from drawing onethemselves. It was later re-drawn by the Frenchmystic “Éliphas Lévi” (Alphonse Constant), and thatwas Mr. B up to the 20th Century.C. The Name“Mohammed”>”Baphomet” also seemed a bitof a stretch, so conspiracy theorists proposed severalalternatives: anagrams, reversed abbreviations, etc.The most sensible interpretation remains thatof Idries Shah, who, in his book The Sufis, suggeststhat the term was probably a corruption of theArabic abufihamat (pronounced “bufihimat”),which means “father” or “source of understanding”.An interesting alternative is that that“Baphomet” derives from the ancient Egyptian Ba-- 375 -neb-Tettu, the hieroglyphic term for the city ofMendes in the Nile Delta.In Ptolemaic accounts Mendes was “notorious”for its goat-god, who was said to mate with womenin religious festivals. The truth is probably less lurid.Comments Sir E.A. Wallis Budge in his Gods of theEgyptians:The title Ba-neb-Tettu was sometimes heldto mean the “Soul, the Lord Tettu”, and this wasthe name at Mendes of the local form of Khnemu,whose symbol there, as elsewhere, was a ram … Hewas regarded as the virile principle in gods andmen, and is styled ‘King of the South and North,the ram, the virile male, the holy phallus whichstirreth up the passions of love.D. For Bessy or WirthThe artwork for the current emblem’s goat/pentagram first appears in a 1931 book by OswaldWirth. 173In 1961, French author Maurice Bessy wanted adramatic illustration for the front cover of hisillustrated history of magic, so he added concentricrings around Wirth’s goat with room for a spookyname between the rings. Cabalism was Jewish, so asuitably Cabalistic name had to be in Hebrew, whoseletters already look mysterious to “gentiles”.The only problem was that “Satan” in Hebrewhas only four letters, so Bessy used the 5-letter name173 Wirth, Oswald, La fran-maconnerie rendue intelligible àces adeptes - II, “Le compagnon” , Paris: Derry-Livres, 1931,page #60.[index-376_1.png][index-376_2.jpg][index-376_3.png][index-376_4.jpg]- 376 -of the sea monster Leviathan instead, assuming thatno one would notice or care. He was correct. 174WIRTH!BESSYE. Not a CaduceusIn retrospect it may be just as well that AntonLaVey was satisfied with the Bessy design, else themedia might have not been quite so quick to splashit around. Anton was a very talented oil painter andinkpen sketch artist, but he had his “ReginaldMarsh” side and could be quite merciless inmoments of artistic irreverence.Zeena has been quite sane and dull for thelast couple of years, but now she’s beginning tomake dry little comments that simply floor me.Tonight, after critically viewing a sketch of Anton’s(a man drinking a bottle of beer and scratching hisprivates), she said, “Really! Can’t you ever drawanything sophisticated?” 175174 Bessy, Maurice, A Pictorial History of Magic and theSupernatural, London: Spring Books, 1964 [the originaledition of this work - Histoire en 1000 images de la magie -was published in 1961 by Editions du Pont Royal.]175 Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, April 3, 1973.- 377 -Shortly after I assumed Editorship of theChurch’s Cloven Hoof newsletter in 1971, the HighPriest decided that he would grace it with a newmasthead. As diplomatically predicted by Diane, herhusband was just going to “update the LéviBaphomet a little”. That sounded sensible enough: aproper pentagram at last! But it didn’t stop there:For the masthead my prime thought wasthat the design employed should incorporatecloven hooves, thereby reinforcing the imageconveyed by the title.After drawing a succession of devils, mostlooking either like fugitives from a tin of ham orthird rate opera company rejects from Faustauditions, I started a rather panoramic thingshowing a Devil’s herd, a la “Ghost Riders”,galloping across the top of the page. My intentionswere the best, but alas, the page was too small, andwhat began as a DeMille-type hippodrome peteredout to a shopping center dog and pony circus.A stylized version of Baphomet was decidedupon because I felt that Lévi’s version, whileluridly graphic for the 19th Century, is far tooeuphemistic for today’s climate. Such concessionsas the ill-fitted “good” pentagram on the forehead,the caduceus in lieu of a virile member, the laprobe to avoid exposure of the caduceus’ point oforigin, a rather unimaginative pair of 39 D-cupmammary glands, arms that would better serve inan ad for Jergen’s Lotion, a right hand apparentlyin the act of hailing a cab, and a Roman candleperched atop the head do little to advance theimpression of the truly base and carnal aspect ofthe Beast of the World!I have tried to beef up the aforementionedand drawn the horns in the manner of certaineastern and African wild goats rather than theusual, domestic variety. The membranous wingsand scales have been added to graphically intensifythe Hellish origin.Use your own judgment as to the colorrendition. I have enclosed a couple of suggestions.[index-378_1.jpg]- 378 -Using red in only the eyes and the smokefrom the cranial exhaust (mistakenly assumed bymost occultists to be some sort of candle) wouldcertainly give the impression of a head “filled upwith burning mist and golden mire” as well asdirect the reader’s gaze towards the title. Allusionsto red, blazing eyes can be found throughout thelore of Satan, from the ghouls and afrits of Persiato Dracula himself. Or, if you feel it is morestriking in black and white, please don’t hesitate toforgo color altogether. I am frankly undecided.Diane prefers either the plain black andwhite or black and white with just the touch of redin the eyes and smoke. I’ll leave it up to you andJanet176 to decide. 177“Well,” laughed Jan, “I don’t suppose we’llneed to worry about members leaving their copieslying around on coffee-tables or office desks!”176 My late former wife and a Priestess of Mendes III°.177 Letter, Anton LaVey to M.A. Aquino, October 23, 1971.[index-379_1.jpg][index-379_2.jpg]- 379 -F. Brandymet & BeyondNow that the Cloven Hoof had a suitablyupstanding masthead, I took another look at theBessyBaph and decided that it might do with sometinkering too. The goat’s nose had always looked asthough he’d run into a brick wall, and he also lookedslightly cross-eyed [possibly the result of theimpact?].I didn’t have a goat available as a model, so ourIrish Setter Brandy was drafted:I’m not certain what the Knights Templar, thegood citizens of Ba-neb-Tettu , or the Prince ofDarkness might think of the result, but the“Brandymet” not only graced the Nineveh Grotto’sritual chamber thereafter, but even hat its momentof stardom, when the Grotto was invited to designthe ritual chamber for Asylum of Satan, a horrormovie being filmed in Louisville. So our Brandymet,accompanied by dæmon-candleholders Chet[index-380_1.jpg][index-380_2.jpg][index-380_3.jpg][index-380_4.jpg][index-380_5.jpg][index-380_6.jpg][index-380_7.jpg][index-380_8.jpg]- 380 -Huntley & David Brinkley, and by griffin guardiansHaldeman & Erlichman, left the hushed hallows ofNineveh, to preside over proceedings that wouldunquestionably ennoble and exalt the Church ofSatan’s image for years:Two further experiments briefly came andwent: my Goat Deco “BrandyBat”, and Anton’sstained-glass altar backdrop for The Devil’s Rain.[index-381_1.png][index-381_2.png]- 381 -In 2018 the Bessy Baphomet appears to persistin the Satanist saddle, even if most devotees remain“unclear on the concept”. [That’s O.K.: I’m not surethat many Christians can explain why they veneratethe device that tortured Jesus to death, or the Jewsthe Star of David (absent archæological evidencethat he even existed, much less used that glyph.]For my final tweak of the Brandymet, I startedby redefining every line of Wirth/Bessy, mirroringthe result precisely, and re-redoing Mr. Mendes’eyes and nose. Since I’m not a Jew, I saw no need forthe Hebrew, but I also realized that almost anyEnglish-alphabetic of S-A-T-A-N looks dreadfullydull. An appropriately ancient or alien alternative isessential to properly perplex perusing profane. Thisexample is from the fragments of a fallen fane foundby Ahnenerbe archæologists in the Sahyadri Jungleof India in 1934, principally - according to LouvreAssistant Curator Dr. René Emile Belloq - for cursesand warnings. It is shown here next to a Bessy forease of comparison.- 382 -[index-383_1.jpg]- 383 -BibliographyAlvarez, A., The Savage God: A Study of Suicide.New York: Random House, 1972.Anger, Kenneth,- Hollywood Babylon.
