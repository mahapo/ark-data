"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" PHILOSOPHY Ancient Egyptian Philosophy Inhabiting a land characterized by the regularity of the elements (behavior of the winds, the Nile, the climate, the Sun, and the skies), the Egyptians sought perfection in stability, harmony, symmetry, geometry, and a cyclical [as opposed to progressive or linear] concept of time. Egyptian achievements, correspondingly, were in areas such as as tronomy, mathematics, medicine, and architecture. Egyptian religion and art tend to be oversimplifie d in many modern treatme nts, due in part to the absence of verifiable data in later hi story until the decipheri ng of hieroglyphics by Champollion in 1822. Because of the destruction and despoliation of ancient Egyptian records and works of art by religious fana tics of later eras, it is estima ted that modern archaeologists have at their disposal less than 10% of that country's cu ltural creations from which to reconstruct its values.

To the Egyptians, all of \"nature\" (d erived from neter) wa s alive and the direct consequence of the wills of the neteru. Nature was intelligible not just through inanimate, automatic, general regularities which could be di scovered via the \"scientific method;\" but also through connections and associations between thin gs and events perceived in the human mind . There was no distinction between \"real ity\" and \"appearance;\" anything capable of exerting an effect upon the mind thereby existed. [Hence a dream could be considered just as \"real\" and thus significant as a daytime experience.] Egyptian art, literature, and science looked for b eauty and symmetry (felt to be indications of divine perfection), rather than for cause and effect relationships. He nce Egyptian thought is sometimes called \"geometric\" as opposed to the \"algebraic\" thought of Hellenic and later logicians. Since impressions and appearances substantia ted reality, the Egyptia n emphasis on portraits and statues of the neteru was not merely decorative, metaphorical, or symbolic. Rather an image was a medium whereby the neter in question could make an actual appearance in the material world. [Note: Contrast Egyptian statuary with Greek, Roman, or later European. The \"living presence\" in the former will be dramatically evident.] Similarly part of something could substitute for the whole as long as th e mind completed the connection. Mental imagery created by viewing the portrait of a dead relative, for example, brought that relative to true life. Egypt was divided into 42 nomes (provinces), each dominated by the priesthood of one or more divinities. A particular priesthood might also domina te more than one nome. The monarchy was closely controlled by the various orders of priesthood, with the Pharaoh acting as an Earthly deputy of and interpreter for the neteru . Governmental, judi cial, and political systems were responsible for their ethics to the neteru , not to the people. Justice was meted out by Viziers (internal roving ambassadors of the Pharaoh) and nome governors according to the neter of justice, Maat , on an individual case basis. Th ere was no concept of individual rights against the government, because government was viewed as a system ordered by the neteru . Similarly each Egyptian, whether high or lo wborn, participated in this system. Crime and corruption were of course possible, but in advisable because of the conviction that vice would be punished severely after Earthly death. Old Kingdom Egypt was largely insulated from foreign invasion or conflict, hence Egypt spent its early years as a peacef ul culture with no standing mil itary. Egypt is credited with invention of the alphabet, as well as the use of currency as a medium of exchange. It is noteworthy for having produced th e first national (as opposed to city-state) poli tical system, as well as the most enduring one in recorded history (more than 3,000 years). There was no caste, racial, or sexual discrimination; fore igners were consider ed \"less than human (=Egyptian)\", but could remedy this misfort une simply by moving to Egypt and adopting Egyptian culture. Egypt was ultimately destroyed by foreign conq uerors (Persia, Macedonia, Rome) and her inability to adapt to the continuing competition of foreign cultures. Her New Empire of the Setian (XIXXX) Dynasties was a prot ectionist backlash rather than an effort to \"civilize\" or create a permanent empire [as pe r Macedonia, Persia, or Rome]. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Mesopotamian Philosophy Mesopotamia is that area (the \"f ertile crescent\") in the ancient near east generally defined to include Sumer (beginning ca. 2500 BCE), Babylonia (b. 2000 BCE), and Assyria (b. 1300 BCE), and which shared cultural ties with Ca naan (b. 1400 BCE) and Israel (b. 1200 BCE). All of the Mesopotamian cultures were polytheisti c, with the exception of Israel in its later development. Humanity was considered to ha ve been created merely to serve the local divinity or divinities, the priesthood of whom tended to dominate the government and control most of the property [on behalf of the god(s) ]. Those gods were anthropomorphic, with essentially human motives and desires which were manifest through the forces of nature. The generally harsher and more unpred ictable elements in Mesopota mia may partially explain the generally harsher and more unpredictable person alities of the Mesopotamian gods in contrast to the Egyptian neteru . Like Egypt, the ancient near east shows a ble nding of the scientific and the emotional. Supernatural beings were thought to be inti mately involved with human fortunes on a daily basis. Hence the \"life experience\" of a Mesopotam ian was as much magical as it was rational. Whereas the Egyptian political system was str ongly centralized and monarchic, the earliest Mesopotamian cultures tended to be localized an d democratic, with kings or military leaders being selected by elders when emergencies ar ose. The transcultural \"binding force\" was religious tradition. Permanent monarchies are a ssumed to have arisen because of increasing external threats to lo cal tribes, coupled with ambition by would-be dynastic founders. In Mesopotamia the role of the city-state king was similar to that of the Egyptian Pharaoh, except that the king was responsible to the gods for the running of the kingdom, and himself was not considered one of them. [Fewer than 20 Mesopotamian kings between 2300 and 1500 BCE laid claim to personal divinity.] \"Subs titute kings\" were occasionally employed in Classification: V2 - 102 - 2 Author: Michael A.

In Egypt this never happened; the actual Pharaoh re mained completely accountable. Virtue in Mesopotamia was understood as obedien ce to the willful desires of the god(s), not harmony with their natural prin ciples. The \"wrath of the gods \" was feared by the state in Mesopotamia, as it was never in Egypt (whi ch was ruled by a god-king). The Mesopotamian king sought the \"right ruling\" of his community, in accordance w ith the Akkadian principle of Shulmu (later adopted by the Hebrews as Shalom ) ... a term meaning not just \"peace\" but the community well-being that engenders peace. Ea rly Sumerian law was based on the principles of Lex talionis (\"an eye for an eye\"), semi-private admi nistration of justice, inequality before the law (higher classes were more protected, but when found guilty were subject to more severe punishments), and the drawing of little distinction between deliberate and accidental crime. Sumerian science was comparable to E gyptian, but significantly inferior in medicine, geometry, and architecture. In the \"Old Testament\" of the Bible a distinction between reli gion and politics is drawn, with the former assuming the right to criticize the la tter. The Hebraic kingshi p is notable as being primarily secular in responsibility; interacti on with and representation of Yahweh was the responsibility of a separate priesthood. Ancient Hebrew re ligion progressed through four stages: (1) pre-Mosaic animism and magic, (2) national monolatry (one god but toleration of others), (3) monotheism, and (4) dualism [ada pted from Persian Zoroastrianism (after Zaratustra, ca. 600 BCE)]. Dualism involves a conflict between two oppos ing forces of the cosmos in Persia Ahura Mazda vs. Ahriman, and later in Israel Yahweh vs. Satan. The Hebraic Ten Commandments are now dated by most \"Old Testament\" scholars to ca. 600 BCE, some 700 years later than the Exodus. In the Hebraic system, Yahweh is not intelligib le through reason or logic, but rather through prophesy and the history of events, whether or not the events' outcomes seem appropriate (\"theodicy\"). Hence the Hebrews adopted a linear concept of time, as we ll as the notion of a \"covenant\" between mankind and Yahweh; manki nd is thus given a \"mission\" and/or a \"destiny.\" While the Egyptian concept of an afterlife was pleasant, Me sopotamians considered the underworld (Kur-nu-gi-a or Sheol ) as a dim, dismal place.

The Hellenic Greek cultures are most notable for exalting the intellect — for making the universe an intellig ible tool and/or puzzle for mankind to explore, understand, and use. They did not conceive mankind as having a \"m ission\" from the gods, though the gods could influence human fortunes for good or ill. To th e extent that the Greeks put humanity at the \"center\" of importance, they worshipped its body (as in athletics and the Olympic Games) and its mind (as in the sophistic and ph ilosophical schools of Athens). The Cretan (Minoan) political system, a bur eaucratic monarchy most significant for its peacefulness, included no evident slavery, stan ding military, or marked class distinctions. Women appear to have been politically equal with men. Th e Minoan culture was destroyed ca. 1400 BCE by an invasion from Mycenæ. The Mycenæn culture, which faded into the Greek \"dark ages\" within another three centuries, denied women equality and did have slavery. The \"dark ages\" lasted from 1100 to 800 BCE and came to an end with the founding of the first Greek city-states. The first Greek writing appears in about the 8th century BCE, with the first dated writing in 600 BCE. The later Hellenic era (600-300 BCE) — based as it was on empirica l investigation and inductive reasoning — was a challenge to the ol der, tribal way of doing things. Previously custom ( nomos ) was the rule for behavior, and to follow custom was dike , the path of justice. Disregard of custom was hybris , and was unacceptable and even dangerous beyond its immediate implications. As it became increasingly evident that social prob lems, such as the reform of Athenian laws by Draco and then Solon, could be solv ed by either an appeal to either relative practicality or absolute standards , a growing controversy aros e concerning the relation of nomos to physis (nature or the divine order). Foremost of the absolutists was Pythagoras, who sought in number the beginning or arche of things -- the ordering princi ple or \"one behind the many\". The teachers of relativism were known as sophists . There were a great many of them in Periclean Athens, and they gave advice ranging from the practical to the quasi-legal [there were no lawyers per se ]. They performed an important f unction in the socialization of the community, but absolutist philosophers suspec ted the commercial motives behind their teaching, as well as their subordi nation of ideals to effectivene ss. The most famous of the sophists was Protagoras (ca. 481-410 BCE), associated with the aphorism: \"Man is the measure of all things.\" Protagoras was a materia list, holding that the e xplanation of all things lay in matter, but he further argued that each person perceives and interprets matter according Classification: V2 - 102 - 3 Author: Michael A.

Institut ions are not a ma nifestation of physis ; they are conventions of human experience. In dark ages Greece the universe was an unknow n quantity, superior to all gods, who are \"humans writ large\" within it and who govern the fortunes and the passio ns of mankind. [Consider the active involv ement of the gods in the Iliad and Odyssey .] In the \"golden age\" of Athenian culture, the universe was thought not to be a function of any supernatural, conscious will. Rather it was conceived as a highly comp lex, logically intelligible machine which may be understood through reason. Basic divi sions in this reason were the materialism of such individuals as Anaximander and Democritus (\"atoms\"), and the panpsychism of Thales (ca. 640-546) of the Ægean island of Miletus, who had been schooled in Egypt. Panpsychism teaches that every living substance has an immortal psyche or soul, which transmigrates into other life forms. In later Greek Hellenic thought, materialism was to lead into the sophism of Protagoras, while panpsychism was to conti nue into Pythagoreanism and then into the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. [Panpsychism was a crucial component of Orphism, the cult of Dionysus, which emphasized the division of the human being into psychic and material components.] Pythagoras (569-470 BCE) was born and lived hi s early years on Samos, which was exposed to the \"barbaric\" east as well as to the Greek west. Initiated into the Egyptian priesthood of Hathor, he remained in Egypt over ten year s, learned hieroglyphics , and was exposed to astronomy, geometry, and the Egyptian concepts of panpsychism. Sent to Babylon, he was there exposed to Persian dualism. He saw the psyche as \"good\" and the matter into which it entered as \"evil\", but accepted their merger as something at least temporarily fulfilling to both. Goal for the psyche was its escape from reincarnation into an eternal existence of pure spirit — the \"music of the spheres\". From his academy at Crotona, Magna Græciacia, Pythagoras advised students (both male and female) and political clients to strive to eliminate sources of friction and cultivate homonoia (\"good relations among the citizenry\"). He s uggested that mankind was subject to hybris (diverse and chaotic animal emotions). Accep tance of a master principle or \"threatening eminence\" called epanastasis is necessary to ensure homonoia in human relations. This master principle was an intuitive apprehension of the divinity of th e cosmos: the \"gods\" whom Pythagoras saw as abstract principles or \"pure numbers\". The monad (1) is the symbol of finity, existe nce, and permanence in the cosmos. The dyad (2) counters the monad as an evil spirit ( kakos daimon ), by \"breaking away\" from the monad. \"3\" shows the action of the monad and the dyad in the creation of existence [as a plane is formed]. \"4\" extends creation to three dimensions, a nd was seen to conceal the sacred decad (1+2+3+4=10). \"5\" symbolizes the five at omic shapes: the pyramid, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron (fur ther representing fire, earth, ai r, water, and ether). \"6\" is the first perfect number (its products adding to 6) , and like \"5\" is circular in that its powers always produce numbers ending in itself. \"7\" is the only prime number in the decad which cannot generate another number in the decad. \"8\" symbolizes the cube, and \"9\" is important as the highest number before the series is repeated. Most of Plato's comments concerning panpsychi sm, numbers, mathematics, and geometry are echoes, simplifications, and corruptions of Py thagoras' earlier ideas on these subjects. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" The Philosophy of Plato Fourth-century-BCE (\"golden age\") Athens wa s strongly rational and humanistic. The human mind and body were admired and exalted. The debate between the Pythagoreans/Platonists and the materialists/sophists centered on whether there were more to man — and more to the Cosmic order — than matter and behavior. In th e realm of art, the Greeks admired perfection of the body. Their statues are almost always of idealized figures and physiques. [Contrast this with Roman sculpture, which was more realistic in its portrayal of actual, rather than ideal features.] The cosmology of Plato (387-347 BCE) centers on his famous \"Theory of the Forms,\" in which the gods are defined as in Egypt, save th at they are not directly concerned with human affairs, but rather with the Forms or First Prin ciples which are the ordering mechanisms of the universe and everything in it [i ncluding humankind]. Plato concei ves the universe as a highly complex, logically intelligible machine whic h may be understood through philosophy (which is reserved to elite, higher intellects). Ther e is no life after death, but transmigration of the psyche does occur. Plato [in the Laws ] defends belief in the gods because of (1) the doctrine of the immortal psyche, and (2) the eviden t order in the universe. Plato's philosophy concerning immortality can be found in the Phaedo , specifically discussions of the recollective basis of knowledge and the cyclical theory of immortality. Plato was an adherent of teleology . This is the doctrine that fi nal causes of phenomena exist. Further that purpose and design are a part of or are apparent in nature. Further that phenomena are not only guided by mechanical forces, but also move towards certain goals of self- realization. [The opposite of teleology is mechanism , which describes phenomena in terms of prior causes instead of their presumed destination or fulfillment. Modern science is thus mechanistic.] Plato [through the character of Socrates in his Dialogues ] considered the soul or psyche as the repository of the entire personality or char acter. One should not attempt to purify the psyche by rituals or restrictions, but rather to develop it through exerci se of its facultie s. The state is the psyche magnified, hence the Republic is most accurately seen as a prescription for the psyche magnified. Specifically there is a three-pa rt similarity between state and soul: The state's populace, auxiliaries, and guardians corres pond to the soul's sensation, will, and reason. The respective virtues are temp erance, courage, and wisdom. In the Republic Thrasymachus suggests that Justice is merely the interest s of the stronger. Socrates responds that they may not know their in terests. Glaucon then suggests that Justice is Classification: V2 - 102 - 4 Author: Michael A.

Socrates indirectly refutes this by prescribing the ideal state — the \"Republic.\" Hence Socrates answers Thrasymachus and Glaucon by arguing that it is more natural for a man to be just rather than unjust if his soul is hea lthy and each part is doing its proper work. It was important to Plato that vi rtue be raised to a level of rationality . It was not enough for people to be unconsciously or in stinctively virtuous; they must \"taste of the knowledge of good and evil\" and then know ingly choose the good. Plato stratified thought as Eikasia (primitive emotion), Pistis (ordinary active/reactive thinking), Dianoia (precise, logical, en lightened thought), and Noesis (intuition and apprehension of the Agathon ). He offered the famous \"parable of the cave,\" whereby philosophers (who have seen the Agathon of perfect wisdom) lead mankind into the light by means of the dialectic . [Here \"dialectic\" means teaching or rather the encouraging of self- teaching through examination and refu tation of imperfect concepts.] Plato was an elitist, but his elitism was di rected towards an ideal, happy, and harmonious society, which he felt could best be attained by enlightened stratific ation of roles. His prescription was thus benevolent aristocracy. Critics of Plato erroneously attack him as a totalitarian oligarch. They are also bewildered by the \"mysticism\" which permeates his writings. Such \"mysticism\" is intelligible to those familiar with Egyptian and Pythagorean concepts. In the Laws Plato argues that the wise man must be subjected to laws which are not as competent as he is in order that unwise men will continue to trust him, because otherwise they cannot understand him. Virtue in the Laws is the proper posture to wards pleasure and pain reached by reason. lf the reasoning is adopted by the city, the result is law. The rule of laws is an imitation of divine rule. Hence honor must be paid to the gods by the populace. There must be resistance to law-changing, but laws can be changed with caution by wise men (philosophers). Failures of the ideal state result in timocracy (run according to soldierly ideals or power), oligarchy (based upon control by we alth), democracy (a state governed by the passions of the masses), and tyranny (mani pulation by self-interested autocrats). The Platonic Academy existed for 900 years. It was finally abolished by the Emperor Justinian in 529 CE; he was afraid that it was too unChristian. The Platonic Dialogues were lost to Europe until the 15th century. The Philosophy of Aristotle Classification: V2 - 102 - 5 Author: Michael A. Aquino VI° Date:  October  1,  XIX  Revision: January 1, XXIV HTML Revision: Oct 07, 1997 CE Subject:  Philosophy  Reading List: #16"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Aristotle's influence began ca 342 BCE, when he arrived at the Macedonian court as tutor to the young Alexander [the Great]. Moving to Athe ns, he founded his Lyceum in rivalry with Plato's Academy in 335 BCE, after having been de nied the headship of the Academy [where he had earlier been a student of Plato's for 20 years]. In 323 BCE, when Alexander the Great died, Aristotle was hounded from Athens on a char ge of \"impiety.\" His works were lost to Europe upon the fall of the Roman Empire; they resurfaced in the time of Thomas Aquinas and were treated as Catholic dogma. Aristotle attempts to disprove or attack Pl ato, but his criticisms are somewhat shaky. An example is his attack on Plato's elitism, while he himself defends the concept of natural slavery. Aristotle may be credited with endea voring to interrelate many fields of knowledge carefully and systematically. Othe rwise he is as beholden to Plat o as Plato is to Pythagoras. Aristotle conceptualized a Universe of moti on and causes (mechanism), which can be traced back to an \"unmoved mover.\" This is not the personalized God of Judao-Christianity, but an impersonal force. Individual immortality did not play a part in Aristotle's cosmology. Here he broke with Pythagoras and Plato. The Aristoteli an soul perished with the mortal body, save for its \"creative reason,\" which was a universal rath er than an individual, egocentric feature. In his Metaphysics Aristotle mounts an attack on the Pythagorean/Platonic Theory of the Forms. Aristotle accepted the Theory of the Form s in principle, but denied that the Forms are more important than their material manifestati ons. He considered form and matter to be of equal importance, and essential to each other s existence. Aristotle attacks Plato as saying that the individu al exists only to serve the state [an erroneous interpretation of Plato]. Aristotle deplores sl avery by law (such as enslavement of prisoners) but endorses \"natural slavery.\" War for its ow n sake is wrong, unless conquest of a state benefits both the conqueror and the conquered. This ties in with the \"natural slavery\" doctrine. Man, says Aristotle, is by nature a political animal. He can realize his full potential only through interaction with other hum ans, and it is natural for him to do so. The existence of the state is thus conceptually prior to individualism. A political environment makes possible language, ordered communication, and knowledge. The goal of the state is the \"gen eral well-being\": \"The best way of life, for individuals as well as states, is the life of goodness duly equipped with the amount of external and bodily goods, which will make it possible to share in the activ ities of goodness.\" Only in a state with an ideal constitution are the \"good man\" and the \"good citizen\" identical . Otherwise there is conflict, forced choice, and ongoing tension between the two. Aristotle postulates right and wrong kinds of authority: Right is rule in the common interest, and wrong is rule in the interests of only a part or some parts of a society. There are three types of authority: one, few, and many. Combining th e right kinds with the three types results in monarchy, aristocracy, and constitutiona l government [by the middle class]. The perversions of these are tyra nny, oligarchy, and democracy (m ob rule). The best kind of constitutional government is the Politeia : a mixture of democracy, oligarchy, and aristocracy wherein government offices are distributed according to a mixture of personal wealth"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(oligarchy), free birth (democracy), and merit (aristocracy). Constitutional government is the best because it is a mean between the two extremes of democracy and oligarchy. In the Ethics Aristotle cites the \"Golden Mean\" (i.e. the middle course between two theoretical extremes of action) as a more practical measure of goodness than Plato's Agathon . Power, he accordingly suggests, should be vested in the middle class in order to moderate the extremism of the high and low classes. The doc trine of the Golden Mean is thus one of relativism rather than one of the absolutism of the Egyptian, Pythagorean, and Platonic philosophical systems. In his Magick Without Tears (#9D) Aleister Crowley mounts a tongue-in-cheek attack on the concept of the Golden Mean, based on his objec tion to compromise as a device for seeking answers or virtues: \"There is great danger in this Golden Mean, one of whose main objects is to steer clear of shipwreck, Scylla being as fatal as Charybdis. No, this lofty and equable attitude is worse than wrong unless it derives from striking the balan ce between two very distant opposites. One of the worst perils of the present time is that, in the reaction ag ainst ignorant bigotry, people no longer dare to make up their minds about anything. The very practice, which the A ∴ A ∴ so strongly and persistently advocates, tends to ma ke people feel that any positive attitude or gesture is certainly wrong, whatever may be right. They forget that the opposite may, within the limit of the universe of discourse , amount to nothing. \"They fall into flabbiness. \"I avoid this by saying, `Yes, I hate so-and-so like hell; I want to exterminate the very memory of the bastard from the Earth, after I have personally superint ended having him seven years a-killing winding up by hanging, disemboweli ng, and quartering him. But of course I'm not necessarily right about this in any sense; it is merely that I happened to be born the kind of man who feels like that!' \"Of course, in no case does the Golden Mean advise hesitating, trimming, hedging, compromising; the very object of ensuring an ex act balance in your weapon is that its blow may be clean and certain. \"You know how all our faults love to disguise themselves as virt ues: very often as what our neighbors call virtues, not what we ourselves think them. We are all ashamed to be ourselves, and this is sheer, star k stultification. For we are ourselves; we cannot get away from it; all our hypocrisies and shams are just as much a part of ourselves as what we lik e to think is the real man. All that we do when we make these pretenses is to set up internal strain and conflict; there is nothing objective in it. Instead of addi ng to our experience, which is the Great Work, we shut ourselves up in this citadel of civil tu rmoil; it is the formula of the Black Brothers. \"The Golden Mean is more valuable as the extremes which it summarizes are distant from each other; that is the plain m echanics of the lever. So don't pa y too much attention to these remarks; they are no more than the quiet, fire side reflections of a ma n who has spent all his life breaking records.

It was a period characterized by aggressive and innovative trade encouraged by Ptolemai c Egypt and the Seleucid Empire of Persia/Fertile Crescent/southern Turkey. With a bus iness climate not unlike that of the present day, upper- and merchant-class entrepreneurs pr ospered, but the lower classes experienced depressed wages and living standards. This result ed in widespread migration into urban areas and the consequent creation of large cities (such as Alexandria, w ith a population of 500,000- 1,000,000). Hellenistic art differed from Helleni c by a greater emphasis on qualities of exaggerated realism, sensationalism, and vol uptuousness. Luxurious palaces and elaborate public works were undertaken. A flowering of the sciences o ccurred in astronomy, mathematics, geography, medicine, and physics. The Seleucid Empire embraced Elam, Sumeria, Persia, Baby lonia, Assyria, Syria, Phoenicia, and at times Asia Minor and Palestine. The func tion of the empire was to give to the Near East the economic protection provided earlier by Persia a nd later by the Roman Empire. Commerce was the key to its prosperity. Old Persian trade routes were expanded. Money produced in Egypt, Rhodes, Seleucia, and Pergamon replaced the barter of the previous four centuries. Greek civilization was the cultural ideal, but it was a thin veneer beyond the eastern Mediterranean coast. The abstract, metaphorical, and scientific aspects of Greek culture were difficult for the common man to grasp. In the mo re remote areas religion returned to power because, in the words of Will Durant, \"it recogn ized the secret helplessness and loneliness of man, and gave him inspiration and poetry.

Thus pe rished countless record s of mankind's most ancient civilizations.] Egyptian Hellenization extended only to the delt a and did not significantly affect the native population or culture. The Ptolemaic Dynasty co nsidered itself Greek, spoke and wrote Greek, and made no effort to learn Egyptian. But by the 2nd century BCE the Greek culture had been absorbed into the Egyptian. By the time of Ju lius Caesar's arrival in 30 BCE, the Dynasty was so decadent and weak that it fell almost without a blow. The Hellenistic era saw the proliferation of va rious mystery cults, such as those of Isis, Orpheus, Mithras, and Gnosticism. The Helle nistic philosophies discussed below were primarily influential in the intellectual centers of the west, and would persist into the Roman era. Skepticism , introduced by Pyrrho of E lis (360-270 BCE) and Timon of the Platonic Academy in Athens (320-230 BCE), may be defined as the doctrine that any true knowledge is impossible, or that all knowledge is uncertain — a position that no f act or truth can be established on philosophical grounds. [But how could a sincere Skeptic be certain of this position?] If nothing can be conclusively known, argues the Skeptic, then virtue li es in avoidance of judgment and thus of action. The state is someth ing to be reluctantly endured for whatever relief from negative values it offers. It is not a positive thing in itself. In many ways Skepticism may be considered a \"clever\" parody of the Socratic method. Socrates, however, used a Skeptical approach towards knowledge as a \"clearing away the mental underbrush\" device in order to better employ logic. The Skeptics did not pursue a similarly positive, constructive appro ach to the acquisition of knowledge. Epicureanism was a philosophy of hedonistic ethics that considered calmness untroubled by mental or emotional disquiet the highest good, held intellectual pleasures superior to others, and advocated the renunciation of momentary gratification in favor of more permanent pleasures. It was introduced by [and named af ter] Epicurus of Samos (341-270 BCE), and it enjoyed considerable influence among the Greek civilizations of th e Asiatic coasts. Epicurus, a pantheist who reje cted conventional religion, fe lt that the aim of philosophy should be to free humanity from fear of the gods, who, if they exist, are too remote to concern themselves with human fortunes. He rejected metaphysics, holding that humans can know nothing of the suprasensual world. Reason, he sa id, must accept the ev idence of the senses. Epicurus considered mankind a completely na tural product — and mind only another kind of matter. The soul can feel or act only by means of the body, he maintained, and it dies with the body's death. Accordingly Epicurus considered virtue to be not an end in itself, but rather the means toward happiness. He recommended the simple, non-envious life of the country peasant. \"Everything"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"natural is easily procured, and only the useless is costly.\" \"Desires may be ignored when our failure to accomplish them will not really cause us pain.\" Epicureanism thinks of happiness in a negative fashion, i.e. free dom from pain. It thinks of wisdom as an escape from the hazards and pr oblems of life. It is a nice philosophy for one able to pursue it, but few are. An entire polis of Epicureans, to be sure, would cease to function. Stoicism was a philosophical system holding that it is man's duty to freely conform to natural law and his destiny, that virtue is the highest good, and that th e wise man should be free from passion, equally unperturbed by joy or grie f. First introduced by Zeno, a somewhat mysterious Phoenician/Egyptia n (336-264 BCE), it was later es poused by Chrysippus, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius of Rome. Stoicism too was pantheistic: The world is the embodiment of and is governed by the Logos Spermatikos (seminal reason). All the universe is essentially one, but matter is dynamic. The universe goes through cycles of expansion and contraction, devel opment and dissolution. \"God\" is this entire process, not a being apart from it. He is th e \"soul\" of the universe, so to speak. Man is a microcosm of the universe. When he dies, his soul survives death as an impersonal energy. Ultimately this will be reabsorbed into the universal energy. Stoics denied the Skeptical contention that no ob jective knowledge is po ssible, holding rather that a wise man can distinguish reliable impressions (kataleptika phantasia = \"grasping impressions\") from ethereal ones. Hence the Stoi cs thought it possible to identify the universe as a single, integrated substance in which hum an existence and behavi or partake. Knowledge arises through the senses, which are also the fi nal test of truth. Experience does not always lead to knowledge, for perceptions may be dist orted by passion and/or emotion. Reason is the supreme achievement of humanity. Since humanity is integral with nature, goodness is cooperation with nature. It is not the pursuit of pleasure, which would subordinate reason to passion. If evil comes to the good man, it is only temporary and not really evil, sin ce in the greater sense it is natural. The Stoic thus accepts all fortunes and mi sfortunes of life calmly. He seek s an absence of feeling in his thoughts and conduct. Nevertheless Stoicism does not excuse all events as deterministic. The individual is still responsible for virtuous or vi cious choices, measured against a natural approximation. The Stoic considers the \"average man\" a dangerous fool governed by passions and emotions rather than by virtue and reason. The Stoic disa pproves of war and slavery, and believes in humanitarianism and equality of all humans as elements of nature. But he does not advocate violent social revolutions or drastic policie s to attain these ends. Change must come \"naturally,\" not artif icially. Stoics sought harmony in society, which — unlike Epicureans — they acknowledged as natural. The Stoic ideal was a \"world society\" ( cosmopolis ) transcending regional divisions: one of Alexander's goals for his empire. A variant on Stoicism was the early Cynicism of Antisthenes (444-365 BCE) and Diogenes (d. 323 BCE), who advocated a rejection of worldly goods and involvement [including politics] and a concentration on virtue as the only worthy goal. Cynicism's simple opportunism — taking what life offers, for bette r or worse — was eventu ally absorbed into the ethical posture of Stoicism."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Mulford Sibley (author of #16A) comments: \"One of the most striking tendencies in the four Hellenistic schools of thought was the effort to separate the study of ethics from that of politics. Whereas in the Cla ssical thinkers the good for th e individual and the good for the community had to be pursued together, post-Cl assical thought often im plied their fission. The individual's salvation — to us e religious terminology already employed in the second century — was attainable apart from political justice. His ends lay beyond the goals sought by princes and judges.\" Pre-Christian Rome Early Rome was characterized by a mixed constitu tion, with political participation by elite executives (consuls), aristocrats (patricians), and the masses (ple bians), the latter two groups having representation in the legislature (Senate) . After the death of Ju lius Caesar, the system became increasingly imperial/monarchic, w ith an expanding military influence. Roman cosmology consisted of adaptations of Hellenic divinities, but in a context more animistic and less humanistic, with a pries tly class to interpret them. The Roman poet Lucretius (98-55 BCE) is representative of th e later Epicurean and St oic influences that gradually superseded the old animistic paga nism. Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE) is generally regarded as one of the more prominen t advocates of this Roman Stoicism [together with the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 CE)], although he cons idered himself an Academic Skeptic [after the Platonic Academy in Athens]. In the 1st century BCE Rome saw the significant influence of imported initiatory sy stems, such as those of Mithras (Persia), the Magna Mater (Phrygia/Asia Minor), and Osiris/Serapis (Egypt). Roman philosophy was heavily influenced by the cu stoms, needs, and functions of the secular state. At the time of its origin al monarchy, Rome also had an assembly (all male citizens of military age) and a Senate. The assembly was e ssentially a ratifying body with veto power; it could not initiate legislation. The Senate began as the heads of the various powerful clans controlling the Roman state. The king was one of their number, and his powers were delegated by the Senate. At approximately 509 BCE the monarchy was overthrown and replaced by the Roman Republic, with two elected consuls and the provisi on for a dictator to be appointed for a maximum of six mont hs in the event of an emergency.

Roman law is traditionally date d to the publication of the Twelve Tables ca. 450 BCE. Juries decided questions of fact; judges (praetors) interpreted the applicable laws. There were three branches of Roman law: (1) civil law [ ius civile : enacted laws particular to Rome], (2) law of the people [ ius gentium : laws considered to apply to all peoples, foreign and domestic], and (3) natural law [ ius naturale : per Stoicism]. Cicero's two principal works, the Republic and the Laws , have survived only in fragments. He wrote them in the dialogue form, and st ressed the opinion that virtue must be exercised . While pure, contemplative philosophy may be \"h igher,\" it is only in its practical, applied benefit to the state that its existence is justif ied. Similarly Cicero felt that there was a possible conflict between \"wisdom\" and \"justice,\" since th e former calls for self-seeking actions while the latter advocates altruism.

She was constantly fighting either for her existence, to expand her newfound power, or to administer an empire too larg e for a single city-state to administer comfortably. Philosophy was welcomed only insofar as it contri buted to the city's responsibilities and perceive d destinies — not as it might weaken Rome's cohesion. The Philosophy of Thomas Aquinas The \"High Middle Ages\" was not a pa rticularly rich time in terms of the cultural arts, save for architectural ventures in the re latively severe and massive Roma nesque style, followed in the mid-12th century by the Gothic (lighter and lo ftier construction, with greater emphasis upon vertical elements). Some notable ballads and poems ( Nibelungenlied , Parzival , Edda , etc.) were composed about this time, and music b ecame somewhat more complex in its written formats.

By 1250 Aristotle's influence had become so great that he was referred to as \"t he philosopher.\" Hence it was necessary to refine Catholicism to an intellectual precision comparab le with that of Aristo tle, and also to make Aristotle's more secular/scientific works tolerable to the chur ch through a flattering interpretation of them. The bewildering complexity of Thomas A quinas' philosophy may be illustrated by one dictionary definition, which describes \"Thomism\" as: ... teaching that philosophy and theology have separate spheres, with one seeking truth through the agency of reason and the other through that of revelation, but reaching conclusions that support one a nother; that all knowledge begi ns with sense perception from the data of which the intellect abstracts universals, and on the basis of these proceeds through induction and deduction to science and knowledge of things in their causes and thence to knowledge of ultimate causality; an d the conclusion that the Univ erse is the creation of an infinite, uncreated being; that everything in na ture is composed of matter and form, with the potentiality of the former being brought to ac tuality by the latter; that everything which is natural is good in itself and a cause for evil only when used for ends other than those for which it was created or beyond the limits prescrib ed by sound reason or di vine law; and that because of his rational nature man is comp elled by necessity to seek the highest good. Invoking Aristotle's argument for an \"unmoved mover,\" Aquinas suggests that the necessity for a \"first cause\" logically pr oves the existence of God. This was later to be challenged by Hume (who suggests that causes and effect can go forward or backward indefinitely) and Kant (who maintains that the doct rine of causality is applicab le only to the realm of sense experience). Aquinas observes that Ar istotle had advocated the principle that the \"good\" to be found on a large scale is better than the \"good\" to be found on a purel y personal scale, since the larger good more closely approximates and reflects the whole of creation. Aquinas adds that Aristotle had further limited th e political art to a practical application of good principles which, through theoretical philo sophy, had been determined to be good. The state may not interfere with the determination process itself. For non-human animals the \"good\" consists of sensual pleasure, but for mankind something more is sought. Since mankind is teleological, it s telos must lie beyond th is life: the vision of God. The aim of social life is t hus \"not merely to live in virtue , but rather through virtuous life to attain to the enjoyment of G od.\" Since natural human virtue is insufficient to attain this, it is not the task of secular rulers but rather that of Christ through his c hurch, to whose pope \"all kings in Christendom should be subject.\" In addition to the Aristotelian/te leological content of Aquinas' thought, there is the legalistic element: The Universe is obedient to laws. Aqui nas defined \"law\" as \"an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has the car e of the community, and promulgated.\" But as nature is hierarchically organized in to forms and organisms of greater and lesser complexity, so are the Universal laws. At the top is Eternal Law , which more or less equates with the mind of God. Accordingly it is intelligible only to God. Next is Natural Law , which"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"is Eternal Law to the extent that human reason can detect consistencies in it. Here would be found \"scientific laws.\" While Natura l Law is comprehended through reason, Divine Law is revealed through religious revelation — through Christ and the Christia n church. Divine Law and Natural Law \"rank\" more or less side-by-side. Lowest on the scale is Human Law , a term which encompasses laws which mankind ma kes in imitation of and towards the \"good\" perceived in/revealed by Natura l and Divine Law. The \"three drives\" which tempt man away from goodness are (1) wealth, (2) carnal pleasu re, and (3) honor/status. Hence the \"three virtues\" are (1) poverty, (2) ch astity, and (3) obedience. Nowhere is the importance of cosmology better demonstrated than in a consideration of Aquinas. If his cosmology is accepted as a priori valid, then his reasoni ng represents a high point in philosophy — a standard for the Cathol ic church even today. If it is not accepted, then he is a sort of \"Aristotle baptized\" who did as good a job as possible of reconciling Christian dogma with a non-Christian empirical and intuitive Classical philosophy. Aquinas is an example of medieval scholasticism in that he is \"reasoning\" towards a pre- accepted and pre-determined conclusion. Instead of using logic as an investigative device to address questions open-mindedly, he uses it as a vehicle to justify dogm a. While it is easy to see this in Aquinas and other scholasticists, one must also bear in mind the \"intuitive truth\" element to be found in Classical logic as a pplied by Plato, Aristotle, etc. These elder philosophers were not defending institutional dogma, but they were using the device of argumentative logic — the dialectic — to illustrate and substan tiate concepts which they had essentially grasped intuitively, i.e. supralogically. Hence one cannot question Aquinas in this area without questioning them too. Machiavellianism The period ca. 1350-1600, termed the \"Renaiss ance,\" was characterized by a continuing increase in secular education [with emphasis shifting from the clerical universities to secular courts and academies]. The medieval-era em phasis on logic and metaphysics gave way to revived Classical learning in areas such as language, literature, hi story, and ethics. The Renaissance began in Italy due to its strong ties with Clas sical knowledge, and due to the comparative wealth of the major Italian cities . The popes also patroniz ed artists such as Raphael and Michelangelo. Among the other ma sters of the Italia n Renaissance were Botticelli and da Vinci. From 1450 to 1600 a Ne oplatonic movement backed by one of the Florentine Medicis gained consid erable influence. Plato's works were translated into Latin by 1469.

In actuality Machiavelli never advocated evil or depravity; in fact he was a champion of the good and the virtuous. His \"evil\" reputa tion came about simply because he pricked the balloons of so many phony and pretentious people. Machiavelli's philosophy, which was essentia lly political, may be summed up thus: Any means, however lawless or unscrupulous, may be justifiably employed by a ruler in order to establish and maintain a strong central government. Machiavelli pro forma accepted Christian cosmology as revealed in the Bible . Since this source claims to be divinely revealed, he we nt on to say, it is beyond or above reason. Hence unaided human reason cannot discern a difference between political authority based on divine revelation and that which is not based on divi ne revelation (such as pre-Christian pagan rulers). Thus Machiavelli follows the lead of William of Occam [of \"Occam's razor\" fame], who stressed belief in God as a function of pure faith rather than reason. The study of politics, Machiavelli concludes, belongs wholly to th e world of reason and may ignore theological values. Machiavelli sees all political hi story as an interplay between fortuna (chance) and virtu (will, courage, and skill). When virtu is held by the many, republics are possible. When virtu is held by the few, tyrannies result. To understand the governing principles of political life, one must examine the beginnings of significant political systems. It is the beginning that sets the pa ttern for a political situation; successive rulers are relative imitations refl ecting the beginning. This is the basis for Machiavelli's being called the first political scientist , since he seeks an explanation of a state in what it is and has been rather than in its future goals or ideals. The founde r(s) of a society must be excused for acts which are inexcusabl e after the society has been established. The grounds for this initial license are simply the forceful, initial estab lishment of good qualities and benefits of the resultant society. Ex amples of such unprincipled founders in The Prince are Moses, Romulus, and Cyrus — each of whom attacked and destroyed rivals in order to found the important state in question. The principle of legality is sec ondary to that of force: \"The foundations of all states, whether new, old, or mixed, are good laws and good arms . And as there cannot be good laws where there are not good arms, and where there are goo d arms there must be good laws, I will not discuss the laws but will speak of the arms.\" No distinction is drawn between just and unjust laws. Fighting by laws is \"proper to man,\" and fighting by force is \"proper to beasts\"; since the former is often inadequate to deal with the beastly im pulses and compulsions of mankind, the successful ruler must be skilled at the la tter. While men are naturally acquisitive, they do not naturally seek justice. They must be forced to be good by the rulers. The end justifies the means : In order to secure the common good, the ruler must occasionally \"fight fire with fire\" and meet challenges of cruelty and terror with greater cruelty and terror. The common good must be the governing sta ndard for political decisions and actions, replacing transcende nt or divine standards. While cruelty and force can achieve certain a measure of social order and contro l, kindness and benevolence are also valuable"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"tools and can evoke more enduring coopera tion from the populace. Neither cruelty nor kindness is sufficient by itself, however. As transcendent standards for human behavior (which Machiavelli considers impossible to attain) are abandoned, lower and more realistic \"human\" standards take their place. \"For the manner in which men live is so different from the way in which they ought to live that he who leaves the common course for that which he ought to follow will find that it leads him to ruin rather than to safety.\" This focus on reality ultimately encourages man to attain dignity by taking complete responsibility for himself. Machiavelli may be considered the first political philosopher w ho bases his philosophy solely upon \"natural\" [as opposed to divinely inspired] mankind. The \"Divine Law\" part of Aquinas' four-part, legal Universe is irrelevant to Mach iavelli. It is problematical whether Machiavelli is properly called a political scientist , since his historical studies and examples are relatively selective and illustrative of his point of view ra ther than scientifically dispassionate. [The same criticism can be brought to bear on many \"political scientists,\" to be sure — each of whom nurses pet theories and selects data to substantiate and highlight them.] In Machiavelli, nonetheless, we see the beginning of the breaking down of religion from something literal and mandatory to something metaphorical and optiona l. If religion has no bearing upon what Plato termed \"t he master art\" (pol itics), then why should it have more than a gratification or entert ainment value in any other field? Machiavelli did not attack religion directly, as did Niet zsche; rather he ignored it — and it was this presumption which made him a threat. It should be emphasized that Machiavelli did not see himself as malicious or destructive — merely pragmatic. He, like Plato and Aristotle, s ought the best possible state. He limited that \"best possible\" to reason and to mankind in a natural, sub-divine condition. And he excused all incidental excesses in a state only if an ultimate, common good could thereby be more quickly and thoroughly attained. The Reformation By 1500, as a consequence of the invention of the printing press, Europe possessed an estimated 9 million books, as opposed to fewer than 100 thousand hand-wrought manuscripts ca. 1450. The exchange of ideas was accelerated, a nd with it criticism of religious, political, and social norms. Classification: V2 - 102 - 10 Author: Michael A.

The Reformation's key proponents we re Martin Luther (1483-1546) in Germany and John Calvin (1509-1564) in Switzerland. While there were a number of sub-movements throughout Europe, they generally agreed upon Fundamental Christianity as characterized by (1 ) the finality and ultimate authority of the Bible , (2) denial of the authority of the church bureaucracy to interpret the Bible , (3) repudiation of reason and affirma tion of faith instead, (4) condemnation of the use of force for religious conversion, and (5) \"the two realms\" [s piritual grace and poli tical power] concept, which licenses unChristian acts if commanded by secular authority. To these essentially Lutheran points Calvin adds a strong element of church coercion of the individual and intolerance of alternative reli gions. \"God makes plain that the false prophet is to be stoned without mercy. We are to crush beneath our heel all affections of nature when His honor is involved.\" Luther and Calvin believed that mankind is to tally depraved — that even \"good works\" fall short of God's standards of righteousness. The re ason for ethical behavior is that a righteous man will automatically incline towards such behavi or, not because it is logically or ethically justified in itself. Salvation is attainable only by complete surrender of the self to Christ. This constitutes a rejection of medieval scholastici sm, and of the \"logical ethics\" arguments of Aristotle (\"this damned, conceited, rascally heathen\" — Luther) and Aquinas. \"Reason\" is mistrusted and even condemned. Concerning the two kingdoms Ca lvin stated: \"Let us observe that in man government is twofold: the one spiritual, by whic h the conscience is trained to piety and divine worship; the other civil, by which the individual is instruct ed in those duties which as men and citizens we are bound to perform. To these two forms are co mmonly given the not in appropriate names of spiritual and temporal jurisdiction, intimating that the former species has reference to the life of the soul, while the latter re lates to matters of th e present life, not only to food and clothing, but to the enacting of laws wh ich require a man to live amon g his fellows purely, honorably, and moderately. The former has its seat within the soul; the latter only regulates external conduct. We call the one the spiritual, the other the temporal kingdom.\" Calvin avoided prescribing the best form of gov ernment, feeling that this is a [question for secular authorities to decide. luther consid ered collective governme nts to magnify human corruption, hence he favored monarchies. agai nst catholicism luther and calvin argued the autonomy of the state under god. against radical fundamentalists such as the anabaptists, they argued the theological necessity for civil government. against a ggressive civil rulers they argued the autonomy of the church [in the protestant sense]. Calvinism condemned art, Lutheranism tended to ignore it, and within Catholicism there was a reaction against renditi ons of nudes, resulting in the def acing or alteratio n of many earlier works. Consequently there were few Reformati on-era artists of note, with the exception of Dürer, Holbein, and El Greco.

This support was born esse ntially of the desire by these groups to rid themselves of the economic burden of the papa cy and its subordinate echelons. In time the Reformation provoked the Catholic \"Count er-Reformation,\" a somewhat militant retrenchment by that church. From 1545 to 1563 the Council of Trent, a Catholic Church conference, met to resolve questions of dogma . Once decided, these dogma were promulgated and enforced with a seriousness not found dur ing the pleasure-loving papacy of the Renaissance. \"If my own father were a heretic ,\" said Paul IV, \"I would burn him.\" In 1540 Ignatius Loyola founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), characterized by extreme discipline and Machiavellian social influence. Loyola pl aced great stress on education, and by the 17th century Jesuit-dominated univers ities were educating virtually all of Catholic Europe. After 1550 tensions between Catholics and Prot estants had reached the stage of religious warfare, culminating in the terrible Thirty Years' War between Denmark, Sweden, and the Protestant German principalities on one hand a nd the Catholic Hapsbur gs (Spain, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, and most of Catholic Ge rmany) on the other. France, though Catholic, fought against the Hapsburgs for secular polit ical reasons. Approximately one-third of Germany's population died from the war and its side-effects, and the final Peace of Westphalia (1648) was brought a bout more by exhaustion than by genuine reconciliation. The Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes The period from ca. 1500 to 1789 is generally refe rred to as the \"Age of Absolutism,\" in that European monarchs enjoyed their greatest au thority during this era. In addition to the Reformation, which weakened the secular power of the Catholic Church, monarchs were strengthened by new sources of income and by th e pressures of frequent wars (which tended to unify nations around central authorities). The Age of Absolutism marked the beginning of the modern state system, characterized by (1) legal equality of states; (2) right of states to declare war, pursue a foreign policy, and make alliances; (3) employment of diplomacy as a su bstitute for war; and (4) birth of the \"balance of power\" concept. Elizabeth I of England died in 1603 and was fo llowed by James I and then Charles I, who so antagonized the Parliament and the populace th rough arrogance and excessive, arbitrary taxation that the English Civil War broke out in 1642.

Charles' son James II was deposed by a bloodless coup in 1688-89 (the Glorious Revo lution) in favor of William and Mary. In France Louis XIV (the \"Sun King\") reigne d from 1643 to 1715. He devoted much time and effort to affairs of state, but was followed by two incompetent kings, Louis XV and XVI, whose estrangement from the people ultimate ly led to the French Revolution of 1789. Spain's Philip II reigned from 1556 to 1598. Th e defeat of his \"Invincible Armada\" by Elizabeth I's England in 1588 marked the beginn ing of Spain's decline as a great power in Europe. Frederick II (\"the Great\") re igned in Prussia from 1740 to 1786. His domestic policies were progressive, although his forei gn policy was as warlike as those of his neighbors. Culturally the 16th and 17th centuries were a time of transition between medieval/Renaissance knowledge and the new, sc ientific climate of the Enlightenment. In Hobbes' time ancient history was still known only by the \"Old Testament,\" other histories being considered later and infe rior to it. While scripture put creation at 4004 BCE, histories began ca. 400 BCE, with large episod es of later hist ory being unknown. The Universe was generally thought to be Ea rth-centric, and the non-Christian/European world was considered to be \"savage.\" It was difficult for intellectuals to know just what to believe! Even the noted Galileo published his Authority of Scripture in 1614, and Isaac Newton devoted many years to Biblical studies. He wrote: \"If any question at any time arise concerning Christ's interpretations, we are to beware of philosophy and vain deceit and oppositions of science falsely so-called, and have recourse to the Old Testament.\" A generation after he published his famous Principia , Newton was still trying to discover the exact plan of Solomon's Temple, which he c onsidered the best guide to the topography of Heaven. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) took a scientific, materialistic appro ach to the objective universe, asserting that the supernatural or subjective universe was beyond rational understanding. Politics belongs who lly to the realm of the rational and natural. Impressed by mathematics and geometry, Hobbes postulated hu man behavior as similarly structured. He thus sought to understand the \"mechanics\" or \"laws\" of human polit ical behavior. Hobbes departed from Aristotle and the medieval tradition by denying that man is a social animal, i.e. that he seeks companionship, society, and politic al interaction as an end in itself. Man is indeed a \"solitary beast.\" There is no \"supreme good\"; there is only self-interest and gratific ation. \"In the first place, I put for a general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death.\" The \"supreme ev il\" is death, and it is fear of death that prompts human cooperation. Society is thus negatively motivated. In contrast to the \"natural inequality\" espoused by Aristotle, Hobbes argues that all men are \"naturally equal.\" Henc e the door is opened for social contract , which Hobbes defines as a de facto contract between the people and the government for popular security and prosperity. The individual \"contracts\" with society and is thus bound to obey its laws, but he may disobey if his life is threatened. He re serves the right to make this decision for himself. The social contract has two parts: (1) agreement to acknowledge as s overeign the individual or group"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"selected by the majority and (2) the vote determ ining the sovereign. The task of reason is to intensify the fear of death and th e desire for comfort as factors in society — to the extent that the resultant cooperation overcomes the destru ctive desires for \"glory\" and \"pride.\" Hobbes' ideal government has a simple task: to ma intain order and security for the benefit of the citizens. The citizens, he says, do not submerge their individuality in it; they are \"contracting parties\" with it. Government shoul d be authoritarian but not totalitarian. Hobbes preferred monarchy as a form of governm ent, but monarchy based upon its social effectiveness in maintaining order — not base d upon the \"divine right of kings\" principle. While Hobbes is systematic, he is not scientific in the sense that he supports his contentions with empirical evidence. He is still a purely ra tional philosopher, much like Machiavelli. He was the first exponent of \"possessive individual ism\" — the trade oriented ethic of the 17th century that ran counter to the landed aristocr atic system and institutional religious conflict. He advocated politics based upon material self-i nterest for individuals. Hobbes differs from Machiavelli in that Hobbes does propose a mora lly binding social law (based on natural law in the \"observed behavior\" sense) . Machiavelli is comparatively lawless: no social contract, no rationale other than raw power politics. Hobbes is not intentionally \"savage.\" He is endeavoring to describe the most workable, cooperative, and peaceful society. His reputa tion for harshness comes from his coldly practical analysis of what makes human bei ngs behave unpleasantly towards one another. Previously \"evil\" had been excused as a theologica l force: the result of original sin: something for which rational man was not himself comple tely responsible. H obbes denies all such excuses.

Among the features of the Enlightenment were: (1) A relegation of mankind to a \"natural place, \" not a privileged place within the natural order of things. (2) A vague, general disbelief that God, if he were presumed to exist, would ignore the operation of natural laws to take an interest in the behavior of individual human beings for better or worse. (3) A sentimental admiration for the culture of ancient Greece and Rome, together with a distaste for the medieval Christian heritage. (4) Increased emphasis on the affairs of the pr esent world as opposed to an afterlife. (5) A growing humanitarianism , being respect for and kindness to others for their own sake as fellow natural creatures. The Enlightenment, however, was a phenomenon limited to the literate, wealthy, and noble classes. The masses of the Eu ropean populace were still impulsive and superstitious. The 16th and 17th centuries also encompassed Europe's great witchcraft hysteria, when millions of victims were tortured and burned to death at th e stake, primarily in France and Germany. The appearance of Halley's comet in 1682 was popularly interpreted as a sign of divine wrath. So the \"confused\" climate of Hobbes' era continue d to pervade much of Locke's. It may be hypothesized that the forthcoming age of re volutions was energized by the spread of Enlightenment techniques among a general populace insufficiently educated and enlightened to handle them save through oversimp lified, extreme, violent methods. John Locke (1632-1704) was an advocate of a \"reasonable\" Christianity, admitting pro forma the possibility of revelation but not taking it into political account. His re ligious toleration was noteworthy but limited, excluding as it did atheists and Catholic s. Locke saw humanity as having begun in a \"state of nature\": \"Men living together accordi ng to reason, without a common superior on Earth with authority to j udge between them, is properly the state of nature.\" The opposite of the state of nature is civil so ciety: `\"Those who are united into one body and have a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them, and punish offenders, are in civil society one with another; but those who have no such common appeal, I mean on Earth, are still in the state of nature.\" The basis for Locke's civil society is cooperative self-preservation . Locke does not talk significantly in terms of such id eals as charity, ethics, morality, virtue, love, etc. His basis for society is positive, assuming willing cooperation, as opposed to the point of view of Hobbes, whose society came together through hatred and fear. The state of nature shouldn't be endured, since it is characterized by poverty and hardship. [Locke uses the Indians of the Americas as an example of people living in the \"natural state.\"] The remedy is civil government. Locke introduced a \"labor theory of value,\" sa ying that it is the changes wrought in the natural animal, vegetable, and mineral goods of the Ea rth which makes them valuable. Another way"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"to make them valuable is to restrict the s upply by closing off producing areas, i.e. private ownership of land and assets. Locke defends private ownership and accumulation of wealth and power through money as raising the general standard of living above that of \"penury,\" which he attributes to the state of nature. Hence the concept of property becomes central to Locke's civil society. \"The great and chief e nd ... of men' s uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves under government is the preserva tion of their property.\" This \"property\" is defined to include \"life, liberty, and estate\" (the basis for the famous phrase in the U.S. Declaration of Independence). Since self-preservation (incl uding personal property) is the most powerful emotion, Locke feels that any government which is not based up on it is fighting nature and will not survive. He takes issue with the ancient philosophers, who considered the emotions to be things to be suppressed and conquered in favor of rational virt ues. Politically he was a social contract theorist, advocating a de facto contract between the people an d the government to provide for the people's \"life, liberty, and estate\": \"Political power, then, I take to be a right of making laws, with penalties of death, and, consequent ly, all less penalties for the regulating and preserving of property, and of employing the forc e of the community in the execution of such laws and in the defense of the commonwealth fr om foreign injury, and all this only for the public good.\" Locke is responsible for the doctrine that all government should be limited in its powers and exists only by consent of the governed . He introduces the concept of inalienable rights , which cannot be \"contracted\" away to th e government or anyone else. He postulates that \"all men are created equal\": ... there being no thing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously born to all th e same advantages of nature and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another, without subordination or subjection.\" Locke's preferred form of government is lim ited government, with the legislative branch superior to the executive. He cons idered the judicial function to be included in the legislative. He advocated policy making based on what he ca lled the \"law of the greater force,\" which is interpreted to mean majority rule. This implies the democratization of truth . \"Prerogative\" is Locke's term for the ability of the executive, ki ng or otherwise, to occasionally act above and beyond the written law \"for the public good.\" \"The people shall be judge\" whether the powers of government are being used to endanger th e people. According to Locke, an abusive executive is actually \"warring\" on the people by us ing the force they entrusted to him against them. Thus he is no longer a political leader but a tyrant. He , not they, is outside the society. Locke distinguished between rebellion and revolution . He approved of the former and disapproved of the latter, since revolution implie s the overturning of the entire social order as opposed to ridding the society of a tyrant. Locke bases his political philosophy upon reason, paying lip service to rational ideals. Like Hobbes he wants to build a system that will re flect \"basic man\" rather than one which sets ideals and expectations for him th at he cannot reach. The advantag e of this kind of system is that it never over-reaches itself and rarely falls victim to hypocrisy of a structural sort, since not much except cooperation and stab ility is expected of it. The disadvantage is that it is a difficult system to improve by inspired or intell ectual leadership, since the political power is concentrated in majority opinion — which tends to be sluggish, conservative, complacent, and apathetic — unless a crisis shoc ks it into action.

They are valuable only insofar as they contribute to society as reflections of the gene ral will. As a popular ordering device he would rather cynically propose the institution of a \"civil religion\" requiring belief in God, immortality, happiness of the ju st, punishment of the wicked, and sanctity of the social contract and the laws. Subordinate to the civil relig ion, religious creeds would be tolerated if they themselves are tolerant. Rousseau feels that the defects of civil societ y are due to its basis in economic motivations. Since personal profit is the primary factor de termining human relations , trust and fellowship are destroyed, and selfishness and neglect of ci vic duty are encouraged.

Moreover their subjects emerge from the vices of the sou l: idle curiosity and desire s for unnecessary comforts. Rousseau's ideal societies are the city-states of ancient Greece (Sparta in particular) and Rome, because they were operated — at least or iginally — on the principles of virtue. His modern ideal state would be an improvement upon their basic concepts. He feels that the other social contract theorists were not radical enough in their effo rts to understand pre-political man. Hobbes was correct in saying that societ ies are built on hostility and avarice, but wrong in saying that man is naturally this way. Locke was correct in saying that societies' purpose is to protect private property, but wrong in saying th at this is natural a nd reflects justice. Rousseau's natural man has two fundamental passions: (1) self preservation, (2) sympathy with others of his kind. Natural man differs fr om other animals because of his capacity for free exercise of the will. He is not governed merely by instinct. The awareness of this free will is evidence of the spirituality of the human s oul (= implies its somewhat vaguely conceived immortality). Man can also use his will to im prove his level of knowledge and sustain it over generations. It is this same free will which is ma n's downfall, because he has used it to move from a \"free animal\" existence to the misery of civil life based upon inequality and private property. Modern man cannot very well go back to a natural state of existence, so ... \"[The problem is] to find a form of association which defends a nd protects with all the common force the person and the goods of each associate; by which each, uniting himself to all, obeys nevertheless only himself and remains as free as before.\" ... to ha ve one's cake and eat it too: to reapproach natural freedom while retaining the benefits of civil society. Rousseau's solution is that everyone first give all of his rights and prope rty to the state, and submerge his personal will in a cooperative \"gener al will.\" The only true source of morality is this \"general will.\" Because it is a function of al l the citizens, it is limited in its flexibility, and this limitation establishes the boundaries of morality. Having moved from a benevolent state of nature to a civil society which encourages hostility and avarice, mankind needs a social contract which best reflects the \"general will.\" This \"general will\" will most closely approach the virtues of natural mankind. If a man obeys his private will in a civil state, he reduces himself to the level of a brute animal and causes society to degenerate into an oppr essive, power manipulative system. He must formulate his own will in terms of relevance to moral principle [as expressed by the \"general will\"]: Thus society \"forces him to be free\" — to exercise his will in coherence with the \"general will.\" His conscious acceptance of th is responsibility results in his true human dignity. Rousseau is a republican by necessity, since mode rn states are too larg e for direct democracy. He considers representative government unfortunate, however, since it weakens the expression of the \"general will.\" He advocates a majoritarian voting system, but he stresses that this will work only if people do not vote ac cording to their privat e wills, but according to the rather severe morality imposed by the \"gen eral will.\" Rousseau despised the democracy known to his time as \"a wild anar chy of self-interest.\" Factions — such as political parties and interest groups — would have to be outlawed as devices corrupting a person's interests and motives away from those of the \"general will. \" Rousseau allows no re served or inalienable rights against the government [as does Locke], because they de facto weaken the \"general"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"will\" by allowing individuals to i gnore the social contract at crit ical moments. Moreover it is the private life of the individual whic h determines his respect for public laws and institutions. Rousseau is perhaps a little too convenient ly considered the philosopher of the French Revolution [as Locke is of the American]. It is true that Rousseau's espousal of emotion over reason, and his glorification of the masses (the \"general will\") lend themselves to this interpretation. But the actual causes of the French Revolution (more properly Revolutions, as there was a series of them) were (1) the in ability of the French absolute monarchy to effectively run the country and (2) a national financial crisis caused by almost constant war and the exemption of the nobility and the clergy from domestic taxation. During the Revolution Rousseau's appeal was never to the mi ddle classes of the \"third estate,\" who were uneasy about the property abolition aspects of his philosophy. Rather his appeal was to the more radical elements in the lower classes, who gained power for a time during the Reign of Terror. The Philosophy of Hume David Hume (1711-1776) is the fa ther of modern empiricism, which holds philosophical and political values to be determined by habit and by their apparent utility, not by abstract virtues or ideals. Cosmologically he adhered to deism . The mere existence of a political system or institution, according to this a pproach, demonstrates that it has a part in God's overall scheme of things. If it didn't have such a part, it wouldn' t have come into existence. What that scheme might be is not addressed by Hume, hence political philosophy and systems cannot be measured critically according to it. Looking at the human mind, Hume sees perceptions , which consist of impressions \"when we hear, see, feel, love, hate, desire, or will;\" and ideas \"when we reflect upon a passion or an object which is not present.\" Impr essions are more \"strong\" and \" lively\" than ideas. All ideas are derived from impressions. As a blind man ca nnot have an idea of a color nor a deaf man an idea of music, so \"we can never think of anything which we have not seen [or otherwise sensed] without us or felt in our own minds.\" We cannot have factual knowledge of anything which can be conceived otherwise. Since it is possible to think that the Sun will not rise tomorrow, we cannot know that it necessarily will. The laws of nature which say that it will might change between now and then. Mathematics and geometry are examples of things in which principles cannot be conceived otherwise. One cannot think of a triangle whose internal angles do not add to 180°.

He finds that he cannot accept them as either. Theref ore they are simply irrational, non-factual passions . Hume sees reason as a device used to satisfy passions, not something which is superior or prior to them. \"Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" Hume considers the morally good as what one ought to do according to prevailing passionate custom. It cannot be ascertaine d by dispassionate reasoning. R eason may be used to discover the \"fitting\" — the most practical or sensible approach — but not the \"morally good.\" Hence virtue and vice are products of sentiment . Virtue is not approved because it is virtue; it is considered to be virtue because it meets with passionate approval. The good is identical with the pleasant, but not necessarily with one's own immediate personal pleasure. Examples of what Hume consid ers virtues: (1) Useful to others: justice, generosity, beneficence, honesty. (2) Useful to self: prudence, frugality, temperance, industry. (3) Pleasant to others: modest y, wit, decency. (4) Pleasant to self: self-esteem, glory. We approve of such \"virtues\" because we are moved by a sense of humanity or benevolence . This is not a \"natural instinct,\" but rather the result of a sympathy which humans feel for one another — a transference of the applicability of others' predicaments into one's own frame of reference. Social justice is sought not out of simple, direct self-i nterest, but rather because we feel that even remote injustices will act to harm the cooperative society. Hume's objection to social contract theory is that he thinks it is simply historically false. Rulers don't consider their authority as base d upon the consent of th e ruled, nor do subjects feel sovereign. Thus Hume is the \"prototypical Tory\" as Locke is the \"prototypical Whig.\" Hume also objected to social contract theory on the grounds that it was based upon reform of humans by reason . Hume argues for strong governments and preservation of systems based upon their historical dura bility: He is thus a conservative . The Christian political thinkers had God/Christ-b ased values. The social contract thinkers had reason-based values. Hume has endeavored to deal with politics by ignoring the former and denying the actual validity of the latter. He thus finds himself in a no-man's-land of subjective opinion. His somewhat clumsy solution is to endorse and preserve values simply because they have been around for a long time (i.e. conservatis m). Strict conservatives tend to be Hume- like, just as radicals tend to oppose values based upon non-rational sentiment and to favor ideals based upon reason. This is not to say that much of their \"reasoning\" isn't guilty of the weaknesses which Hume identifies. The Philosophy of Hegel "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Europe in the early 19th century was in fluenced significantly by budding forces of Romanticism , nationalism , and liberalism . The first represented a re jection of the \"cult of reason\" espoused by the social contract theorists of the Enli ghtenment, in favor of a more emotional approach to social and cultural issues. The second re presented a growing identification of the individual wi th a nation or state, as oppose d to with a city or monarch. This was particularly significant in the cases of Germany and Italy, which until now had remained largely fragmented. The third repr esented a general impatience with archaic aristocratic systems as justifying a state's existence. The Enlightenment and the Age of Revolution had opened the door to critical analys is of state systems, not just to their glorification. Georg W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) deve loped his theories of dialect ic idealism and organicism by approximately 1816, when he held a professorshi p at the University of Heidelberg. His two principal concepts are defined as follows: (1) Hegel conceives the Universe as the manife station of God's mind seeking complete self- realization through a process called dialectic idealism . This is occasionally [and more precisely] called the dialectic of absolute spirit . As applied to Earth, it is the concept that the history of the world consists of part of th e spirit of God, manifesting itself through the collective spirits of mankind, moving onwards through logic (the dialectic) towards complete self-understanding. An existing idea (thesis) is criticized and pa rtially refuted by its opposite (antithesis), resulting in a more perfect concept (synthesis). (2) The organic state is the manifestation or appearance of God in the material world. [It is not identical with God; it is a \"reflection\" of the dialectic of his mi nd. Accordingly it proceeds in ways and towards goals which are not necessa rily the sum total of the ways and goals of the individual human minds within it.] In many ways Hegel is a reaction (antithesis & synthesis) to Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Bishop Berkeley's subjective idealism had held that nothing c ould be known objectively — that knowledge is limited to subjective impressi ons. Kant refines this into what is called critical idealism , in which human conscious ness is subdivided into sensation , understanding , and pure reason . Sensations and understanding of them and consequences of them can be proven, Kant says, but pure reas on (concepts unsupported by sensations) cannot be conclusive. It is \"beyond causality.\" Hegel overcomes Kant's problem by making \"pure reason\" a necessary and intrinsic characteristic of God/the Universe. All history is \"logical.\" If it sometimes seems illogical, it is because we don't see it as clearly and comprehensively as God does. The task of philosophy, therefore, is one of understanding , of logical analysis — and not one of creation of abstract, ideal political systems. Classification: V2 - 102 - 15 Author: Michael A.

With He gel, of course, the mind develops forward through time (historically); wher eas with Plato the levels of t hought are measures of excellence irrespective of time or progression. Hege l's phenomenology of mind begins with consciousness, which is everyday experience (action and reaction to events) without self- consciousness. We take the truth of conscious experiences for granted; Hegel calls this sense- certainty . As soon as one pauses to reflect on conscious experiences, one moves to self- consciousness . At the same time there comes an awareness of ot her selves, other minds. This is very close to Hobbes' concept of the state of nature. The anta gonism is because \"they exist and are not me.\" Therefore I wish to control th em and not to be controlled by them. I wish recognition by them; I do not wish to recognize them in retur n. Thus there comes into being the political \"master/slave relationship.\" The next step in the dialectic involves a pe rsonal internalization of the master/slave relationship, as exemplified in Hellenistic stoicism and skepticism. The inconsistency this produces between internal and external life goes on to produce the rages and hypocrisies of medieval Christianity. In the Reformation the in ternal is seen as rele vant to, and in command of the external. There is still the problem of conflict between indi vidual wills, which, if undisciplined through organization and government, would run wild in anarchy \"... since any institution whatever is antagoni stic to the abstract self-c onsciousness of equality.\" As consciousness gives way to self-c onsciousness, questions of morality ( Moralitäät ) arise in contrast to custom or social convention ( Sittlichkeit ). How to aspire to morality? The answer is that one apprehends it through the modern state. Hegel's concept of the st ate is that it is the embodiment of the spirit of those who constitute it; its leaders mu st consider this spirit and not simply their own desires when guiding it. Correspondingly individuals must seek in this spirit ( Volksgeist ) a guide for their personal morality. Human society is an artificial machine which works for the goals of the spiritual state . Individualism and rights against a government are considered by Hegel to limit freedom: Since they reduce the scope and power of the whole, they serve to limit possibility. Similarly Hegel feels contempt for democracy. It reduces questions of rele vance to the state to resolution by simple \"counting of noses,\" i.e. vot ing, in which all opinions are not of the same intellectual merit. [Hegel pref ers a monarchy. This preference is a weak area of his thought, since it is not really ju stified. Why should an accident of bi rth make one any better a judge of the Volksgeist ?] For Hegel there are no absolute values. Values are products of history; they are validated by their success. Thus Hegel overcomes Hume's objection to morality. The \"social contract\" theorists — Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau — felt that man made the state . Hegel reversed this, saying that the state is prior to man . He thus conceived the most advanced and complex metaphysical statement of man as a product a nd subject of his environment. Unlike B.F. Skinner and other environmental materialists , however, Hegel postulated a deliberate, Universal intelligence behind the historical process.

He was an atheist and a materialist, insisting that the universe [or world] of appearances is the on ly true one. He carries this principle into his assessment of humanity by denying any \"dual exis tence\" within the body (i.e. soul vs. physical body). Man is a unified, material being. Nietzsche defines the Will to Power as the inherent compulsion of any being to create and contro l its environment and interactions with other beings. Its ultimate e xpression in society is the creation of values by which other beings will live and be governed. Nietzsche attacks the Hegelian vi ew of rational histor y, asserting that it is full of \"blindness, madness, and injustice.\" By att acking \"history as God,\" of course, Nietzsche attacks any demonstrations of God which ar e justified by a \"rational, logi cal\" historical dialectic. Past events, says Nietzsche, are valuable to the extent that they serve as monumental models of past greatness, antiquarian mementos of tradition, and objects for critical analysis leading to the destruction of erroneous values in favor of the construction of better ones. Abuse of the first leads to the mistaken idea that the past ca n or will come again; abuse of the second leads to detachment from the present; abuse of the third leads to a pessimism wherein one sees only the failures of things, unconsciously neglecting their positive legacy. Nietzsche interprets Hegel as saying that hi story had now reached its perfection in the contemporary German state system. Nietzsche se es danger in this because it would lead to lassitude on the part of modern man, who woul d feel \"there is nothing more to be done.\" [Compare the \"last days\" sects of early, medieval, and modern Christianity, as well as the \"ecological doomsday\" ideologies of the late 20th century.] Man differs from other animals, says Nietzsche, in that he has the power to \"create horizons\" — to construct visions, ideas, and ultimately philosophical systems. These horizons are meaningful to him unless he perceives them as ar tificial constructs. In that case he either destroys them in favor of newer, larger hor izons or degrades hims elf by an artificial, hypocritical self-limitation to a horizon he knows is false. Plato is wrong, says Nietzsche, in assuming there to be absolute values (the Theory of the Forms). It is rather the case that all truths are situational and relative. Hence the great virtues are supra-rational . They cannot be explained by logic, as Nietzsche accuses Socrates of trying to do.

He has no gods, no values, no progressive history — nothing external to help him. Thus disillusioned, he is str ongly tempted to abandon all aspirations and live only for self- gratification and comfort. This is Nietzsche's \"last man.\" He seeks ne ither power nor social inequalities; he wants society \"leveled\" — ever yone the same. \"`We have invented happiness,' say the last men, and they blink.\" [Nietzsche considered Marx to be the prophet of the \"last man\" ideology.] Nietzsche lashes out at the stat es of his time because he feels that they are tending towards the \"last man\" c ondition. This is also his essen tial objection to Christianity and democracy: They destroy man's creative powe rs and opportunities to distinguish himself in society. As the democratic world becomes more cyni cal of governments and disillusioned by religion, it will gradually polarize into the haves (bourge oisie) and have-nots (s ocialists). There is no justification for the acquisitions and possession s of the bourgeoisie; they result from petty self-gratification. What the bour geoisie actually fear from socialist movements is that they will take the acquisitions and possessions. Nietzsche has comparable contempt for the socialists/radical left because they insist on i gnoring \"the actual inequa lity of man.\" Hence the ideal socialist state is simply a tyranny of the most inferior and the most stupid. Since all ideals, all horizons ha ve been shown to be false, the creative individual reacts against this intolerable movement toward s the \"last man\" with an impulse of nihilism . Nihilism as Nietzsche conceives it is a psyc hological sickness, a tendency towards self- destruction born of resentment of one's pe rceived impotence in th e face of a terrible, degenerate, yet seemingly inevitable future. This nihilism, continues Nietzsche, is false and unnecessary. It is caused by moral training [in particular Christia nity] which suggests that we must be forgiven for existing, that life is a bur den, that self-love is sinful. One must wrench oneself free of this \"Spirit of Gravity\" and unleash one's creative capability: the Will to Power. He who successfully accomplishes this is Nietzsche's \"superman.\" The superman is not necessarily a political leader or despot, t hough he will be the archit ect of values by which society lives. He is a \"horizon maker,\" a suprem ely creative artist. He is not the product of any particular country or race, but ra ther of a purely mental evolution.

He says: \"And perhaps a great day will come when a people, distinguished through wa r and victories, volunt arily proclaims: 'We break the sword.' Disarming oneself, from an intensity of feeling, while one is the best armed: That is the means to real peace.\" Yet Nietzsche does not hold out much hope fo r a rescue of humanity by his supermen.

We have ente red the classical age of war on the largest scale, the age of scientific war with popular na tional support.\" Looking ahead he sees \"Signs of the next (20th) century: The en trance of Russia into culture.

The move towards industrialization spre ad to Belgium as a consequence of English investments in that country, and France and Germany experienced their major industrial booms between 1830 and 1870. Sweden, Denmark, a nd the low countries followed during the period 1871-1914, as did Austria, Bohemia, and Ru ssia. By the period just prior to World War I, the principal countries which were still e ssentially preindustrial were Hungary, Italy, and Spain. During the 1870s a gradual transition could be seen from individual entrepre- neurship to various forms of industrial combination and conglomeration. Government aid to such industrial enterprises was also a new development, consisting of a gradual liberalizing of corporate law and the instituting of protective ta riffs in order to help protect budding national industries against competition from further de veloped foreign ones. By the 1890s England, Belgium, and Holland were the only countri es still observing a free trade policy. The consolidation and organization of business encouraged (by example) the organization of labor. Labor unions first began to experience ge neral legal toleration in France in the period 1864-1884, in England in 1871-1875, and in Austria in the early 1870s. The first international labor organization, the International Workingmen's Association (the \"First International\") was founded in London in 1864 and existed until 1876, wh en it dissolved due to a split between the anarchist faction of Bakunin and the soci alist/Marxist f actions.

Karl Marx (1818-1883) was strongly influenced by Hegel, but believed that Hegel had made a fundamental mistake in using nations as the basis for his dialectic and in relating it to a divine manifestation or purpose. Marx considered the dialectic to be a func tion of economic struggle between social classes, and he denied the existe nce of any supernatural intelligence, calling all religion \"the opiate of the masses.\" Classification: V2 - 102 - 17 Author: Michael A.

Rather one is forced into a particular class by the forces of economics, pa rticularly the means of production. As more and more economic power becomes concen trated in the hands of the upper class (the bourgeoisie), the middle class will disappear, leaving only a large, impoverished working class (the proletariat) opposed to the bourgeoisie. Eventually the strain between these two classes will lead to revolution, resulting in a classless, utopian society. [\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\"] Marx called this end result socialism , but it was ultimately called communism . As a general rule, \"sociali sm\" means ownership of the means of production by the state, while \"com munism\" means ownership collectively by the proletariat. Essential to Marxism are the concepts labor theory of value and theory of surplus value . The labor theory of value suggests that the value of an ite m results from \"the quantity of labor necessary for its production in a given st ate of society, under certain social average conditions of production, with a given social aver age intensity, and average skill of the labor employed.\" Members of the proletariat \"sell\" their labor power (the ability to labor for a specific period) to employers from the capitalist bourgeoisie, but they ar e not paid the entire value of their labor. The pa rt that is not paid to the laborer is called the surplus value . The capitalist keeps this surplus value as his profit. As smaller competitors are driven out of business, the capitalist faces increasing pressure from large competitors. Since the cost of produc ing similar goods is more or less the same, trying to undersell competitors is not effective in the long run. The only way the capitalist can increase his profit is to pay the workers less and less. As the worker realizes that he is being exploited, he will develop class consciousness and ultimately revolt. As economic forces and not ethical values de termine relationships in a capitalis t society, Marx charges that capitalism dehumani zes mankind, causing insecurity, fear, and self- alienation . Unable to find value in other humans, vi ctims of self-alienation find it in produced goods — a phenomenon which Marx calls fetishism (love of possessions). Marxism began the transition into what is called Marxism-Leninism at the turn of the century. Lenin's \"What Is To Be Done?\" pam phlet was published in 1902. Lenin's form of communism argued for a speeding-up of the Ma rxist process via a \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" as well as for establishment of a re volutionary socialist state prior to the utopian state of pure communism. Marx' utopian society would requir e perfection in its citizens. Th is contrasts with most other political philosophies, which are geared to deal with enduring im perfections in human relationships (hatred, greed, selfis hness, sloth, power-lust, etc.). Marx, like Hegel, based his ideas on a necessary, inevitable force of history . Thus communism would eventually come no matter what capitalism tries to do to stop it. The other side of this coin is that there is nothing would-be communists can do to speed it up; their society must first evolve to the \"last stages \" of capitalism. The fi rst country to embrace communism, Russia, was not in an advanced st ate of capitalism — nor have been the other countries which have become communist. Lenin modified Marx (\"Marxism-Leninism\") with the concept of the state- embodied dictatorship of the prolet ariat: the running of the country by"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"a communist party elite until its economic syst ems could be advanced to full communism. The state apparat would then \"with er away.\" It is noteworthy th at power is addictive, and no \"temporary\" communist governments have shown any signs of withering away.

In their effort to justify their continued control, however, modern communi st governments have strengthened their nationalism. Marxism has been corrupted by its use as an id eological slogan in many countries and systems which were completely foreign to Marx' original analysis. This leads us to a certain contempt for \"Marxists\" today, since they seem to be emotionally, not rationall y motivated. This should not necessarily reflect upon Marx himself. A precise Marxist would say that the economic polarization forces which Ma rx identified have been de layed by deficit financing, compromises with the pre-revolutionary pr oletariat (unions, benefits, unemployment compensation, etc.), but that these are all merely postponements of a final reckoning.

We feel capitalized names are easier to read in this quantity than quoted names. II. The Hierarchy Expanding the taxonomy as we have (with the valu able aid of those attending the workshop), we found a hierarchy of opposites, where many sets of opposites seemed to be lower than or subsumed into a higher set of opposites. As the Grand Master compiled this taxonomy for publication in Dialogues , he found that all opposites we had identified at that time could be placed into this hierarchy. These positions are not final; they are but a first-level approximation base d on limited thought anddiscussion within the Order. This is our first published attempt, so discussions, disagree ments, and recmmendations from all Setians are more than welcome.

Those discussions ha ve not progressed far enoug h to produce changes firm enough to publish in the Ruby Tablet . The Taxonomy and discussi on published here are as they appeared in Dialogues issue I.5.] What determines whether one set of opposites is superior to or inferi or to another? What determines whether one set of oppos ites is included within or in cludes another? We have just begun to examine these questions, and have de veloped a few guidelines. Sugges tions are welcome. When one set of opposites can be used as a meas urement of another set, the measuring set is a lower set than that being measured. Examples: Probability is a measure ment of Existence. Success is a measurement of Ability. One set of opposites is lower than another when the first set of opposite s is included within the scope of another (when they are examples of activity or states within that scope). Examples: Sadness and Joy are emotions, and are therefore lower than the opposites of emotion and indifference.

These c odes are subject to change from one version of the taxonomy to another. There will be textual notes discussing many sets of opposite s, perhaps discussing their position in the hierarchy, or why we've classifi ed them the way we have. These notes will be in the same order, and flagged with the same hierarchic code, so you can find them. (Not all opposites are discussed.) III. Syntax This section discusses ho w we list each set of opposites within the Taxonomy. Most pairs of opposites have a wide range of potential values between the two extremes. Others have just the two absolutes, or a very limited number of potential values. We will use a \"-\" between the names of the two absolutes to in dicate the wide range of potentiality, and a \"/\" between the two names to indicate a limite d range of potentiality. Examples: Wisdom - Foolishness, and Set/HarWer. The relationship between the two opposites or their range of poten tiality often has a name. If that name is the same as one of the opposites, we will simply list that name first, eg: \"Intelligence - Stupidity\". If that name is not reflected by one of the opposites, then we will indicate the name which encompasses both opposites, eg: \"Temperatu re: Hot - Cold\". Sometimes a name might not be known. It is th e Grand Master's opinion that Xeper and Maat both have opposites, but none of the Order's initiat es have been able to identify the names of those opposites. Such missing names will be flagged by question marks. IV. Classifications Besides the hierarchy discussed above, we have identified four additional areas of classification which can be applied to these oppo sites. We call these f our areas of classifica tion \"Opposition\", \"Polarity\", \"Obj ectivity\", and \"Variation\". The hierarchical code for each pair of opposite s will be found in the left margin of the taxonomy. The codes which represent the four cla ssifications will be encoded at the right. Since there are four areas of cl assification, there will be four c ode characters at the right of each line. These will represent the four clas sifications, always in the same order: Opposition (OBN?) Dialogues issue # 1 reported that pa irs of opposites tended to fall in to two general categories: those that require Balance between the two ab solutes, and those that require Opposition. Those that require opposition are Neters or abso lutes in which any evidence or influence from one of the opposites is always distasteful to in itiates of the Order, and the Order's goals"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"include eradication of that opposite in all but theory. Wisd om - Foolishness is one example, for fairly obvious reasons. Those that require balance are opposites in which appr oaching the absolutes can be harmful or dangerous, and the Order's initiates will strive to maintain balance in these areas. An obvious example of opposites requiring balance is Abstinence and Gluttony. We still feel this is a useful tool for cataloging opposites, and one which can be very applicable to an initiate's Xeper and/or Quest, but we do not currently us e this classification as the major division. Indeed, we have identified several pairs of opposites for which neither balance nor opposition are required. We therefore code each set of opposites with a letter indicatin g its opposition class: \"B\" for those requiring balance, \"O\" for those requi ring opposition, \"N\" for those requiring neither, and \"?\" for those that we have not yet classified. When opposites require opposition, we will und erline the desired/favored opposite. Polarity (12?) One of participants at the Order of Shuti work shop pointed out that most opposites seem to be based upon a single quality which is in turn reflected or not reflect ed in the absolutes, and is present or missing to varying de grees in the range of potentiali ty between the absolutes. We will call these \"Monopolar\" opposites, and will tag them with a polarity code of \"1\". Example: Hot and Cold are simply the absolute s of heat and no-heat, with temperature being the measurement of heat. You don't cool some thing down by adding cold, you cool something down by removing heat. Other opposites have positive qualities at each en d of their opposing directions. We will call these \"Bipolar\" opposites, and will tag them with a polarity code of \"2\". Examples include Creation vs Destruction (one activ ely puts things together or ta kes them apart), Self and Not Self, and Xeper vs its (as yet unnamed) opposite. Again, we will use \"?\" for those sets of opposites for which we have not been able to identify a polarity. Note: We believe there may also be what can be called \"Tripolar\" opposi tes -- classifications of objects or conditions for which there are three mutually exclus ive absolutes, with measurements possibly indicati ng how much of each quality any existing object or condition may have. There could also be \"Quadripolar \" opposites and higher levels, and these more complex \"opposites\" would then be coded with 3, 4, etc. We invite all Setians to help us discover whether such complex orders of opposites exist. Objectivity (OSB?) Some opposites are strictly objective (\"O\", eg: Li fe - Death; something either lives or it doesn't, and its participation in Life can be objec tively measured); others are subjective (\"S\", eg: Left - Right exist only once a subjective frame of reference is define d); and others are both"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"(\"B\", eg: Motion - Stillness can be measured bo th against the totality of existence [the universe] and also against any individual frame of reference). Variation (IFn?) As indicated above, sometimes there are range s of potential states between two opposites. Sometimes there are a large but finite number of states. Sometimes there are just the two absolutes. The fourth character of each code will be \"I \" if we feel there are an infinite number of possible states between the absolutes (eg: Pr obability), and \"F\" if the number of possible states is finite but uncountable (eg: Life - Death). If only the two absolutes exist, this code will be \"2\" (eg: Set/HarWer), and if there is a third possible state the code will be \"3\". Again, if we have not yet decided this cl assification, we'll encode a \"?\". V. Selection How did we choose the opposites listed in th e taxonomy? How did we choose the names we used for those opposites? Basically, the opposites listed were supplie d by members of the Order of Shuti, by participants at last year's wo rkshop, and by other correspondents. The opposites were then examined for certain criteria, and possibl y eliminated from the list or renamed. Several opposites were eliminated because th ey were found to be relatively unimportant subsets of other opposites. Like and Dislike, fo r instance, are milder examples of Love and Hate. Other pairs were eliminated because upon examination we found them to not be opposites, such as Male and Female. Finally, we had a list of opposites worth listing, and we chose to list them, where possible, as nouns or verbs, rather than lis ting them as adjectives or ad verbs. For instance, we chose Boredom and Excitement instead of \"boring\" and \"exciting\". It seems that true Opposites, Neters of Opposition, should be nameable using nouns (or perhaps verbs). Any set of opposites which is na med using adjectives or adverbs, which can not be named using nouns and verbs, is of questionable value, and may be removed from the list at some later date. Finally, all Setians are welcome to submit new sets of opposites for inclusion in this list. Please do not simply send us antonyms - anyone can go through dictiona ries and pull out thousands of words whose meanings are opposite to each other. Instead, please send us those opposites which have meaning and substance, th ose which are important to one's existence and/or Xeper, and/or to the universe at large.

The Grand Master bases this classification on his opinion that ever ything which can or does exist must be conceivable. Given a variet y of advanced intelligent life forms, we feel that Conscious life is or will be able to a) recognize the existence of everything which exists, and b) extrapolate from things th at exist to all things that don't and can't. We feel that such beings will be able to conceive of everything. 1 Conceivability - Inconceivability N 1 O F"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"All opposites are conceivable, and therefore all opposites fall lower in this hierarchy than Conceivability. The discussion above brings forth the ques tion, \"Can anything be Inconceivable?\" Some of us say yes, and others say no. O bviously we won't benefit much from asking Setians to list those things which are In conceivable. The Grand Master holds the theory that nothing is Inconceivable, as an extension of the above discussion. He invites those with other op inions to debate same. Although the Grand Master hold s the opinion that everythi ng is conceivable, the language allows us to talk about things th at are inconceivable, and that type of language is required for some of the fo llowing discussion. We apologize for any confusion this may engender. Opposition Neither opposition nor balance is required -- something is either conceivable or it is not. We feel it should be a goal of advanced intellig ent life to be able to conceive of everything, but this personal goal does not a ffect the conceivability of anything in itself. Objectivity Again, something is either conceivable or it is not. Common English calls things inconceivable if the specific person involve d could not spontaneously conceive of the matter at hand, or even if that person finds the matter at hand highly unbelievable. We reject this usage, and call \"inconceivable\" only those obj ects and ideas which no being anywhere could ever conceive. Variation Because of the above discussion, we are tempte d to classify this as a 2-point set of opposites (or even a 1-point set of opposites? ). However, we've instead chosen to measure conceivability by the number of in telligent beings who can conceive of the subject at hand (eg: Rain is more c onceivable than subatomic quarks are). Opposition If opposition were required, that would mean that we would find preferable one of two possible universes: one in which everythi ng conceivable existed or one in which nothing existed. The latter is obv iously not desirable, and we tend to reject the former also -- the Grand Master finds the idea of a universe in which human oppression of other humans did not exist to be very attractive. Instead, we expect there is a balance point , where enough things exist, enough variety, to make life interesting, and where those things which detract from Life don't exist. We therefore classify these oppos ites as requiring balance. Objectivity We classify this as an obj ective set of opposites, since so mething either does or does not exist. This causes ques tions to be asked concerni ng our recognition and use of 1a Existence / Non-existence B 1 O 2"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"subjective realities. We sugge st that subjective realitie s do objectively exist, as indicated by their affects upon the objective reality. Variation Since a thing or idea either does or doesn't exist (it can't partially exist), there is no range or measurement between these opposites -- only the opposites th emselves exist. There is plenty of room for argument in this analysis: 1. If something existed yesterday but no longer exists today, it seems reasonable to state that its existence is less strong than something which exists today, and stronger than something which has never and will never exist. We choose in this case to sidestep linear time, a nd we will call \"existing\" anything which ever did or ever will exist. 2. If there is but one of something, it seems reasonable to state that its existence is less than that which numbers four or five billion. Those who lean in this direction are welcome to discuss the subject with Set. Probability is a measure of existence. Probabili ties are measured on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with objects, ideas, or events which have a probabili ty of 1.0 being certain, and those which have a probability of 0.0 being impossibl e. \"Possibility\" includes everything which has a probability greater than 0.0. Opposition Being a measurement, Probability requires neither opposition nor balance. It simply is, as determined by the probability of that which is being measured. Hierarchy Only things which exist can change or rema in the same, and so this set of opposites is of lower order than Existence. Opposition Change is preferable over Stasis, but consta nt change of constantly changing types, quantities, and qualities would be difficult to work with, to say the least. We therefore suggest that these opposit es require Balance. Hierarchy 1a1 Probability: Certai nty - Impossibility N 1 O I 1a2 Change - Stasis B 1 O I 1a2a Life - Death O 1 O F"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Things which are alive or dead always ch ange. Change is a condition and requirement of life and of death, and theref ore this set of opposites is of lower order than Change. Opposition Life is preferable over Death. Although some have questioned the advisability of a universe where all is Life, the Order ha s found no value in Death, and considers Opposition required in this set of opposites, with absolute Life being sought, and Death to be eradicated. Variation Life comes in varying degrees, from the quest ionable life of a virus, through amoeba, monkeys, man, to the Highest of Life. We ha ve no quantitative measure of life (yet?), but we believe the number of measurement points to be finite, if large and unknown. Hierarchy Only that which lives can be Conscious, and therefore this set of opposites is of lower order than Life. Opposition Consciousness is preferable over Unconsci ousness. Many Setians have adopted the Ouspenskian term \"Awake\" to i ndicate the Conscious state. Hierarchy An earlier draft of this hi erarchy placed Xeper and its opposite here, subsidiary to Consciousness and Unconsciousness. The lack of a name for Xeper's opposite brought suggestions of \"stasis\" as that opposit e from Dr. Aquino and Magus Flowers. Magus Flowers' discussion stated, \"In Greek th ere is a perfect set of Opposites for this: dynamis (which is also a normal word us ed for magical power) and stasis.\" He proposed that Xeper and Dynamis were equiva lent, and that stasis is their opposite. Despite the discussions by these two revere d philosopher magicians, the Grand Master still insists that Xeper is a directional dynamis, in a positive direction, and that its opposite is also a directional change, but in a negative direction. We therefore accept the unintended offer of Dynamis and Stas is as undirectiona l opposites, and place Xeper and its opposite lower than these in the hierarchy. Opposition 1a2a1 Consciousness - Unconsciousness O 1 O F 1a2a1a Dynamis - Stasis B 1 O I"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Balance is acceptable here, unlike Conscious ness above and Xeper below. Total and constant Dynamis would not give the Cons ciousness any time to reflect, plan, and direct. Some time to rest, recover, and pr epare is required to support one's optimal Xeper. Hierarchy Only that which lives and is conscious can Xeper, and therefore this set of opposites is of lower order than Consciousness. Furthe r, per the discussion above, Xeper is directed Dynamis, or rather D ynamis in a positive direction. Dr. Aquino pointed out in correspondence, Xe per is not very easy to directionalize, partly because there are so many directio ns within Xeper. Indeed, much of the problem in identifying a name for its opposite is the difficulty in defining the opposite direction. We have no good term for the opposite of Xepe r. Setians often use the terms \"mutate\" or \"mutation\" to signify the reverse of Xepe r. Since Xeper is a positive change in one's being, \"degeneration\" is another term often used. The Order of Shuti is not satisfied with either of these, and welcomes suggestions. Polarity This is a bipolar set of opposites. Both Xe per and its opposite are active changes, often Willful or at least intentional; they are simply changes in opposite directions. Hierarchy Initiation is a process brought a bout when Xeper is directed by Wisdom. It is a form of Xeper, and that is why we place Initiatio n/Mundanity here in the hierarchy. Hierarchy Only that which at least from time to tim e evidences Consciousness can ever exhibit Wisdom or Foolishness (or any level of wisd om between), and therefore this set of opposites is of lower order than Consciousness.

Intelligence is therefore a lower orde r opposite than Wisdom. Hierarchy The ability to comprehend a message or situat ion is a measure of one's intelligence. Note that the Temple of Set recognizes tw o classes of intelligence: that of the Mind and that of the Heart. Similarly there is comprehension using faculties of the Mind, and comprehension using faculties of the H eart. The Xepering black magician should strive to develop both modes of comprehension and intelligence. Hierarchy Patience is another quality which combines with others to make Wisdom. Patience is therefore of the same level as Intelligence. Balance Although patience is generally better (more beneficial) than impatience, sometimes Impatience is appropriate - these oppos ites definitely require balance. Polarity Our first impulse was to classify these as monopolar opposites, but Impatience has such energy, and Patience such potential, th at we decided to wait before making this decision. Hierarchy One's wisdom (or lack thereof) is what leads to abstinen ce, gluttony, and/or moderation. Balance It has been suggested that Indulgence is the balance point between Abstinence and Gluttony.

Hierarchy One's wisdom is often displayed by and influenced by one's objectivity and/or subjectivity of view and opinion. Opposition We classify these opposites as requiring neith er opposition nor balance, since we have found operations in total objectivity, total subj ectivity, and balanced activity, all to be beneficial to one's Xeper and magical abilities. Hierarchy Assigning values of Good and Evil depends upon one's subjectivity and objectivity. All examples of Good and Evil are subject ive. All measures of Good and Evil are subject to change as individua ls and/or societies mature. Dr. Aquino suggested that Bad might be a better name for Good's opposite, \"because 'evil' carries the additional implication of 's omething calculated'.\" But, that implication suggests means that Good will generally be accidental, and we suggest that Conscious beings will calculate and plan Good, performing intentional Good works. Yes, Good and Bad can be used to imply acci dental or naturally occurring desirable and undesirable situations, and perhaps these should be a second pair of opposites subsidiary to Good and Evil. Opposition The popular misconception of black magicians is that we must be Evil (or bad). We sometimes foster this misconception because we find Good in many of the activities and philosophies which the blind public believes to be evil. However, in both objective and subjective arenas, the healthy black magician will always pursue a personal absolute of Good, and seek to destroy Evil. (It's just that our perception of Good and Evil diffe rs significantly from that of the blind public, as do our methods.) 1a2a1b4 Objectivity - Subjectivity N 2 O I 1a2a1b4a Value: Good - Evil O 2 S I 1a2a1b4b Justice - Injustice O 1 S I"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Hierarchy An earlier draft of this taxonomy incl uded Justice under Wisdom, since it takes Wisdom to be able to dispense Justice. Upon further examination, we find Justice (as viewed by most people) to be very subjective, and hence place it here in the hierarchy. This is not fully satisfactory to us, for Maat personifies Justice, and Maat is objective, not subjective. Further, it does take Wisdom to perceive and to operate within Maat. We provisionally leave Justice here, because Maat is more than Justice. Perhaps when we can place Maat and its opposite in this hierarchy, we will move Justice to a position subsidiary to Maat. Hierarchy An earlier draft of this taxonomy included Knowledge unde r Wisdom, thinking it to be a quality which combines with others to make Wisdom. Knowledge therefore was placed at the same level as Intelligence. Upon reconsideration, we find it more likely that Knowledge and Wisdom are of the same level. The wise will always seek and use knowledge, for without knowledge acting wisely is difficult. But the foolish al so often seek and a ttain knowledge - they simply use this knowledge foolishly. Hierarchy We also thought at one time that rationa lity was a quality which contributed to Wisdom, and we have since decided otherwise. Rationality is indeed one mode of activity which can contribute to one's wisdom. Common forms of irrationality definitely do lead to f oolishness. However, Setians have identified a mode of thought/perception wh ich we consider to be beneficial and non-rational. The extreme of non-rational knowledge and thought is named Noesis, and less extreme examples can be named or considered to be suprarational thought. Balance It may be that Noesis does not relate to th e Rationality - Irrationa lity opposites at all, and that these opposites should therefore be classified \"O1OI\", but until we determine that such is the case, we choose to classi fy this set of opposites as requiring balance between positive rational and positive non-rational behavior. (2) {Rereading his II° article on \"Magical Beha vior\", scheduled for the XXVI update to the Ruby Tablet, the Grand Master ponde rs the possibility that Rationality, 1a2a1c Knowledge - Ignorance O 1 O I 1a2a1d Rationality - Irrationality B ?

It's also possible that we may decide in the future to classify these as tripolar opposites, the three poles being Rationality, Irrati onality, and Noesis. Hierarchy Emotion is one quality which can tend to increase one's irration ality. Indifference can help maintain one's rationality. These opposit es are therefore of an order lower than Rationality. Opposition Indifference helps maintain one's impartia lity and rationality, while emotion helps increase one's energy and power. Both are de sirable in their plac e, and so a balance between the two extremes is desired. Hierarchy Love and Hate are emotions. There is some question about these being oppos ites, since they are indeed very similar emotions, and sometimes the results of love and hate can't be told apart. We feel this latter situation comes from people thinking they have one emotion, when instead they have the other. We are therefore willing to consider Love and Hate to be opposites. Hierarchy Desire and Revulsion could be considered lesser forms of Love and Hate, and therefore were almost eliminated from th is taxonomy. But upon reflection we find that Desire and Revulsion are much broader emotions, dealing with and attaching themselves to many more objects than Love and Hate will. Further, while Love and Hate require ba lance, Desire and Revulsion don't - each absolute can be appropriate when dealing wi th the specific objects of these emotions. We therefore class these as di fferent pairs of opposites. 1a2a1d1 Emotion - Indifference B 1 O I 1a2a1d1a Love - Hate B 2 S I 1a2a1d1b Desire - Revulsion N 2 S I"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Opposition We had difficulty assigning an opposition c ode for this pair of opposites. Selfishness is a major characteristic of the Left Hand Path, and intelligent se lfishness, also known as enlightened self-interest, is a desi rable trait in all intelligent life. We have not yet determined definitely whet her the absolute of Selfishness is desirable in all situations, but suspect it is, and ha ve assigned the Opposition code accordingly. Dr. Aquino mentioned, \"Like Diogenes who ro amed Athens with his lantern looking for 'an honest man', I have yet to find an example of 'intentiona l selflessness'. Every act, I maintain, is done for the pleasure or other self-interest of the doer.\" The Grand Master agrees. Further study of this questi on may therefore indicate that there is no objective example of conscious Selflessness. We stress that this Selfishness is one intelligently and consciously directed, with care and forethought. Avarice and Charity are two very different opposites, as shown elsewhere in the taxonomy's list. Hierarchy Only that which is Awake can exercise fr ee will. This set of opposites is of lower order than Consciousness. Opposition The Order of Shuti maintains that absolu te Freedom is desira ble, and that all Conscious beings should strive for such absolute Freedom. The question has been raised (at the work shop and independently in correspondence) whether a decision based on environmental conditions can be considered a freely made decision. Such environmental conditions can range from the legal (it's the law and I don't want to be fined/jailed) to the so cial (they'll laugh at me/dislike me if I'm different) to the physical (tha t bus will flatten me if I don't get out of the way). A free decision is a decision made based upon information, and the environmental conditions are necessary pieces of inform ation. Wisdom might be shown by getting out of the way of the bus, but you exercise your freedom by making the decision either way. 1a2a1d1h Selfishness - Selflessness O 1 S I 1a2a1e Free Will - Predestination O 1 O I 1a2a1e1 Choice: Freedom - Restriction O 1 B I"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"You don't necessarily exercise freedom by acting in a way which causes fines, jail sentences, laughter, or dislike - acts of rebellion could be based upon free choice, or they could be emotional responses to the e nvironment, predictable and restrictive, in which case they should be avoide d by the Conscious initiate. Restriction (Freedom's opposite) is the situation where your environment does not allow you to make (or follow through) with a decision. Restriction comes into play when your \"decision\" is made as an emoti onal response to the environment, or when you are physically restrained from taking acti on (or physically forced to take action). Hierarchy Freedom is one's ability to exercise one's free will independently of other beings' influence. Slavery is one's inability to ex ercise one's free will due to other beings' demands. Objectivity One of the participants at the workshop pointed out that Freedom and Slavery can often be measured by one's self percep tion. While the condition of a slave whose owner carries a deed is obvious, there are many people in today's world who are slaves in one or more ways, to one or more people or organizations. Some of them may recognize this, but most of them do not. They are slaves in our view, but not in theirs. Ar e they therefore slaves? Polarity We tend to think these are bipolar opposites, with the individual striving for Freedom and the environment striving to induce Slavery. Any discussion? Hierarchy : Independence is one's ability to exercise free will without regard to other beings' reactions. Dependence limits one's ability to exercise free will, on threat of the removal of that which one is dependent upon (or threat of some other form of retaliation). One question raised during the workshop deals with interdependence and situations of mutual aid. Such beneficial cooperative re lationships may affect this category of opposites. There is also a great deal of similarity between these opposites and Freedom - Slavery above. We were tempted from time to time to label them as one set of opposites, Independence - Slavery, with dependence bei ng considered a milder or less extreme form of slavery. 1a2a1e1a Freedom - Slavery O ? B F 1a2a1e2 Independence - Dependence O ? B F"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Opposition : We provisionally classify these opposite s as requiring opposition, and claim that absolute Independence is desirable. Set teaches through the Book of Coming Forth by Night that Conscious/magical beings sacr ifice independence whenever we influence the environment. This topic is examined in Magister Menschel's article on HarWer in the Ruby Tablet, in which he proposes that independence will be maintained if enough magical individuals are all influencing th e environment in many independent ways. Polarity : Partly because of the interdependence quest ion raised above, we choose to withhold a decision concerning the polarity of these opposites. Thelema is the active pursuit of one's True and Free Will. Sloth is acceptance of predestination through inaction. Hierarchy : Thelema requires Consciousness. While sloth does not, choosing to be slothful, to not pursue your true Will, does require consciousness of some degree. (Dr. Aquino suggests that an alternate opposite of Thelem a would not be sloth or laziness, but rather \"it would be trying to make a silk purse from a sow's ear, ie: frustrating yourself by trying to do or be things which you have no aptitude for, knowledge about, or physical capab ility for.\" This alternativ e definitely needs to be examined for possible inclusion in this taxonomy. Can anyone suggest a name for this opposite?) Hierarchy : Actively following one's Will may require activ ity at times, and inactivity at other times. Yet Thelema is the active pursuit of that Will. Because of this, we have not yet decided which pair of opposites should be listed higher than the other. Note that Action/Inaction require only life (param ecium and amoeba act), while Thelema requires Consciousness. Hierarchy : Set and HarWer live, although they are not lif e as human biologists would classify it. Set and HarWer are therefore an order of opposites lower than Life.

Several have expressed the opini on that Pleasure and Pain also require Balance, since excessi ve Pleasure seems to be addicting and therefore counter-indicated. The certainty of this position is not yet decided, and if not automatically addicting, absolute Pl easure may indeed be desirable. Hierarchy : Only conscious beings can be at war or peace. Opposition : Peace seems preferable, but society sees ma ny advances during War that are rare or nonexistent during Peace. Competition can be considered a subclass of War, and healthy competition does seem to be very be neficial.

Hierarchy : Individuality and Fusion are goals of cons cious life who recognize the dichotomy of Self and Not Self. These opposites are ther efore of an order lower than Life, Consciousness, and Self. Hierarchy : Our first inclination was to assign Self/Not-Self as an order of opposite lower than Consciousness, for only conscious life can re act to the Not-Self. However, a similar and non-personal set of opposites would be It/N ot-It. Even a rock has a Not-It. We have therefore provisionally classified this order of opposite as lo wer than Existence, equal to Change, and of a higher (m ore general) order than Life. Opposition : We also initially classified this as Opposition required, bu t that would imply attempting to convert everythi ng to Self. If we should succeed, and there would be no Not-Self, we'd be in the same pickle Se t avoided by the creation of HarWer. These opposites therefore either requi re Balance, or they re quire neither Balance nor Opposition. We provisionally assign it this latter classification. Polarity : Both Self and Not-Self exist, for any discre te Self (living or no t). Therefore these are bipolar opposites. We have a minor difficulty here, because we ma y or may not be talking about two sets of opposites with one pair of terms. 1.

The temperature in Sacramento at 5:00 PM PD T on July 30 can be indicated in degrees Kelvin from absolute zero. The discomfort of that temperature will be relative depending upon the person experi encing that temperature. We need therefore to be ready to replace this one entry with two entries, upon discovery of a terminology which will enable us to sepa rate these two types of relativity. Hierarchy : Because of the second type of relativity, th is set of opposites is placed under Self/Not- Self in the hierarchy. The first type of relativity might better belong under Existence/Nonexistence. Opposition : Since these opposites are used primarily for measurement, there is no opposition nor balance required here. Polarity : We lean toward a bipolar classification here , but have not yet d ecided to apply that classification. It may be that Absolute is but a lack of Relativity. It may be that Relativity is but a lack of an Absolute. On the other hand, per the above discussion, we may have here an example of a quadripolar set of opposites. Hierarchy : The Self has an environment, the Not Self. While the term \"immediate\" may have different meanings for different beings, th e immediate environment may be a vacuum (may have nothing in it), or it may be a ple num (be literally full), or it may be normal space (have some stuff in it, and some space between the stuff).

All relative motions can be found to be related to each other through their respective measurements of motion as measured by that objective center.

Hierarchy : Because Temperature is a measure of the motion of the component particles of an object or environment, we classify temperat ure as being lower in the hierarchy than Velocity. All material objects are in a grav ity well. The center of that gr avity well is the absolute limit of down - all directions are up from ther e.

Objectivity : Some discussion has centered on the fact that if you follow the surface of the object in a northerly direction, you will pass the pole a nd start heading south. A better definition of travel in these directions is travel approximately parall el to the line between north and south poles. Hence to continue trave ling north from the north pole, go up (ie: continue increasing your dist ance from the south pole). Facing north, east is to the right, and west is to the left.

Polarity : Many scientists and philosophers will claim that time is unidirectional, that motion through time can only proceed in a forwar d direction. Most normal people would agree. Some scientists and philosophers f eel that time can be reversed, or may be reversed in certain physical environments (such as on the other side of the Big Bang cycle, or on a space ship travelling faster than light). Magical time travel through E.C.I. and astral travel may be possible. Ti me may even be cyclic, with short or long cycles (a long cycle perhaps stretching fr om one Big Bang to another). We'll therefore not yet attempt to propose a polarity. Objectivity : Time appears to be objective - change eith er takes place or it doesn't. The speed of time may be subjective, and there seem to be ot her qualities or areas of time that are of subjective use, but the direction and quantity of time seems to be of durable objectivity over the long run. Entropy is the thermodynamic increase in randomness, in which there will be less and less difference between one part of the universe a nd another. Negentropy is the reverse of entropy, in which there is increasing structure and differentiation. Entropy can be considered the natural conse quence of any and all physical and chemical activity, with few exceptions - en tropy is the result of the passage of time in its forward direction. Negentropy is found in just a fe w \"natural\" arenas. The growth of a crystal of structured matter out of a randomized solution is an exampl e of negentropy. The growth of a tree out of randomized nutrients is another. With the ex ception of the crystal line growth mentioned above, all significant examples of negentropy depe nd upon life as an active negentropic force. Opposition : Entropy's extreme is known as the universa l heat death, where the universe becomes randomized, and no two parts of the unive rse are different enough to allow any significant interaction to be id entified. Extreme entropy is bo ring, as well as dead(ly). Negentropy's extreme would be total structur e, with no randomness at all. While other examples can be thought of, one which co mes to mind would be a universe where on our left you'll find a block of solid hydrogen. Under it is a sphere of liquid helium. Look right, and you'll find a plasma of pur e lithium. And keep looking, and you'll find each and every possible element, gathered together unto itself, without a molecule anywhere.

Ba lance would imply that once that balance point were reached, there would be no increase in en tropy nor negentropy; we would reach total stability and change would end. That doesn't sound desirable to the Grand Master. (It sounds like another form of entropy.) We therefore classify this pair of opposites as having no opposition. Polarity : Negentropy is structure, or the presence of significant differences between two spaces. Entropy is the lack of structure, or the l ack of significant differences. We therefore label this as a monopolar set of opposites. Objectivity : Negentropy and entropy can be measured scient ifically and objectively by the change in potential energy or inform ation within the arena of consideration. We therefore consider these to be objective opposites. Hierarchy : Creation and Destruction are activities which produce Entropy and Negentropy, and so we place Creation and Destruction here in the hierarchy. Creation and Destruction are forms of Change, and so they coul d also be placed under Change. Opposition : Although our first opinion was that Creat ion is always more desirable than Destruction, the arguments above concer ning Negentropy and Entropy have convinced us that these opposites need a balance poi nt. Note that rather than implying a constancy as discussed with Negentropy and Entropy above, we feel that this balance point implies repeated creation and destru ction, causing continual change in both directions.

Note however, that this disagrees with the polarity of the higher level opposites, and may need to be modified. Objectivity : We can propose quasi-scientific definitions fo r Change and Destruction: Creation is a local increase in order and structure, a lo cal reversal of entropy. Destruction is a significant decrease in order and structure, a local and ac tive increase in entropy. We therefore classify these as objective opposites. One possible counter-example to this defini tion we've found is the growth/creation of a crystal, which takes place naturally (ie: favored by entropy).

As a result, much of the following discussion, being introductory in nature, will hinge on these two themes. Gurdjieff's system is a unified body of knowledge embracing chemistry, physiology, psychology, physics, history, and bi ology. It touches on the domains of each of these sciences only as necessary to achieve its purpose — one which is distinct from the raison d'etre of any of the modern sciences. Rea lizing exactly the position of ma n in the universe and what alternatives lie open to him is the goal of study of Gurdjieff's system. To place man exactly, he is part of a very thin layer of organi c life on the Earth, which revolves around the Sun, which revolves around some centr al point of the galaxy, wh ich may revolve around some central point of all that exists. It is a prime concept of Gurdjieff's system that nothing which exists is isolated. Since everything interacts, it is useless to st udy something without some knowledge of its environment. In order to understand the problems that man faces, it is necessary to understand that of which he is most closely a part. The thin layer of organic life which exists on the Earth can best be understood as a transmitting and receiving station of sorts. Ener gy from the Sun is received by it, and is combined with the elements of the Earth. Energy is also received from the planets, though in much smaller amounts. As the further transmissi on of this energy is a subject deserving of treatment at much greater length than is possibl e here, it will not pres ently be dealt with. To continue, we must pick up and examine the concept of evolution. Science has made some unnoticed and unstated assumptions, and defined evolution (implicitly, if not explicitly) as \"that process which resulted in man.\" While it is commonly assumed to lead \"upward,\" a more strictly accepted attitude is that it resu lts in changes with no meaning outside their immediate environment. But evolution has beginnings and endings which are tied up with entropy. Evolution begins in an energy-rich environment where there is a constant build-up a nd breakdown of complex molecules. At this level evoluti on is the exact opposite of entropy. While in the beginning it is a process greatly ti ed to its environment, there comes a time when this restriction begins to break down.

At the point when the organism begins to make changes in itself, consciousness becomes possible. If we unify in our thoughts the concepts of evolution and negative entropy, it becomes easy to visualize the universe as a place of two kinds of changes. Nature determines one's random movements within this universe , subjecting one arbitrarily to both kinds of changes. If one becomes aware of these random movements — mo ments of greater and lesser consciousness — one can use them to pull oneself out of the morass of sleep in which most of humanity exists. For a Setian it should not be too difficult to imag ine that consciousness, a result of evolution, is what the whole process is all about. But at this point I should make it clear that I do not apply this word to the bulk of humanity. It should be evident that most people are determined by television, popular novels, movies, and the accid ents of their daily ex istence. This universe has created them, maintains them, and feeds upon them. There is no reason for them to be different, nor can they ever be so. As stated earlier, everything in the universe is connected. But we are lucky — for to the universe one small group of people is as nothi ng. While the mass of mankind is necessary to the proper entropic workings of the universe, a fe w, more or less, can escape the entropic flow by their own efforts. But all too often the occultist falls into the common error of mankind; even more often he falls into one of his own maki ng. For if at times he controls events and achieves powers he had not known before, he assumes much about his place in the universe and his freedom to act. He is often lulled to sleep by his own abilitie s, never realizing the extent to which he is a mechanism controlled by the laws of an entropi c universe, nor crystallizing in his mind the possibility of changing this state. Gurdjieff's contention of most immediate concer n to the practicing magician is that man's magical powers need more than training for re lease from the three-dimensional world to develop. Man himself stands onl y at the edge of the greate r worlds. Consciousness can only evolve consciously. It is up to you to create within yourself a free being capable of more than mere reaction to events. Gurdjieff's system does not require you to ta ke its assumptions on faith. In a path of knowledge, every step must be verified for one self; otherwise one gives up his consciousness at the very beginning. Perhaps of special import to the Setian is Gurdji eff's idea that without he lp from \"out there,\" it is impossible to escape from the common fate of mankind. He felt that man is too trapped by the mechanicalness of the universe to pull free from its entropic effect without the aid of knowledge either from those who have already escaped, or from some greater intelligence. There are then two necessities: knowledge and one 's own effort. Neither alone is sufficient, but every conscious effort is rewa rded by a change in one's being. Here, by the way, is an idea parallel to Cast enada's \"storing of personal power.\" Gurdjieff taught that living mechanically dissipated the self, while conscious efforts reduced the amount of wasted energy and eventually made it pos sible to \"store\" enough energy to make a qualitative change in being."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Another important similarity between Castenada's writings and the teachings of Gurdjieff is the importance of death. Man is a stupid creature who never really believes that he will die, and proceeds to waste every day of every year of his relatively short life. For real attainment it is necessary to remember one's death, and to cons ider that only the present moment is certain. The first step is to watch oneself. Most persons are limited in their functions to four processes: the instinctive, moving, emotional, and intellect ual centers. Each of th ese is capable of a variety of levels of operation. They may work efficiently or may waste one's energy. They may work with one another, or may intrude a nd take over one another's functions, as when reading a book when one finds that he has gone through several paragrap hs with no awareness of their contents. We are lazy, and our different centers have become used to working badly and without consciousness. To begin, one must pick one of these functions at a time to observe, and it is essential to be honest with oneself. Unless you are an extraord inary individual, you will soon be aware that various functions that you alwa ys thought were under your co ntrol are in fact autonomous. You do nothing, while they determine whether your efforts in any undertaking will be successful or not. You will soon see that each of these functions is a machine entirely dependent upon largely accidental events happeni ng in the mechanical universe. This is a situation that no one can endure once he is made aware of it. Awareness is the key issue. You can agree entirely with wh at this article has said — but the next instant find yourself entirely in the grips of unconsciousness. If you do not ag ree, I suggest that you try once again to watch the functions of each center. The works of Ouspensky give good directions as to the methods which should be employed at first. As you read the books, it will be obvious that most exercises desi gned to increase one's magical abilities can be adapte d to Gurdjieff's system. Exercises which hinge on one's ability to control the direction and intensity of thought need be ch anged only slightl y, the point being the institution of a double consciousness, focu sed on both the thinking process as separate from the self, and upon the self or \"I.\" I reco mmend that no special exercises or rituals be used with Gurdjieff's method until one has expe rienced the effect of the method in his \"non- magical\" life. No, I'm not suggesting that you give up magic for a few months — only that you not practice Gurdjieff's methods magically until you have given them a chance in your natural life. I have not attempted to condense the instruct ions given by Ouspensky and Gurdjieff into a blow-by-blow account of their me thod. It would not be possible, as the method varies with the student.

There is no basis fo r recognizing reality when it impinges; truth and dreams seem the sa me. Not that insights are not available from these \"dreams,\" but there is no basis for comparing them to reality. (2) Waking consciousness : Comparable to the Adept II°.

There is still no true Objectivity, however. (4) Objective consciousness : Comparable to the Master of the Temple IV°, who is fully cognizant and can See. There is a complete framework availa ble to the individual with objective consciousness, hence absolute Truths can be seen and Understood.

Gurdjieff and Ouspensky consider man a type of sophisticated machine, \"Know thyself\" may be considered synonymous with \"know your part s and how they functi on and interrelate.\" This is obviously an incomplete definition, if only because there is litt le point to Working on oneself if one is limited to one's programmi ng (and maybe an occasional random number for variety).

Ouspensky is referring primarily to \"lying\" in the sense of bei ng sure of something of which one cannot be sure, thus making it impossible to take in more data on the subject. (2) Expression of negative emotions causes you to dwell on them instead of really paying attention to yourself. (3) Imagination weakens observation. If one listens to his imagination too much, he sees what he's imagining instead of what is . (4) Talking (Oops!). Related are two sleep producing states: identification with other people or things, and consideration of other people. Both cause the individual to cease concentrating on himself. Ouspensky defines seven levels of man, which he calls Man-1 to Man-7. I found a definite correspondence between these le vels and the Temple of Set degrees. Man-1 through Man-3 are controlled primarily by one of their \" centers\" — the physical, the mental, and the emotional. Man-4 has made a commitment to br eak free of this \"automatic existence,\" hence corresponds to the Setian I°/II°. Ouspensky al so suggests that each category must have a different sort of \"religion\" or guiding philos ophy. This is certainly true within the Temple. The Setian I° has made a commitment to Will, an d this may be said to be his \"religion.\" The Adept II° aspires to Xeper , which is his. The Priest of Se t III°, corresponding to Man-5 (the unified and Self-conscious man), is in a transition phase between Xeper and Xem , and the phrase \" Xeper ir Xem \" is especially appropriate to descri be his \"religion.\" The Master of the Temple IV° has acquired Objective conscious ness, and could be said to \"worship\" Xem . The V° is a concept not corresponding to an Ouspen sky level, hence must be considered an extension of the IV° in this regard. The Ip sissimus VI° corresponds to Ouspensky's Man-7, having a permanent \"I\" and free will, being immo rtal within the limits of the Solar System. This leads me to add a Man-8 to Ouspensky's scheme, being the Man who has Become God, who has reached a position where the entire unive rse lies open to his command (as opposed to merely being accessible) — one who has achieved that pointed to by Xem. (1) The above implies that \"knowing oneself\" can be ta ken as the sign of the Priest III°. This is not, however, complete. Remember that the Temple of Set started with the ideas of Gurdjieff and others, then evolved from there. I think the key to this lies in the concept of Neter . In \"knowing himself,\" the Priest unlocks an additiona l gate to an aspect of himself which can be expressed as a Neter ."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"This symbolic expression of himself acts as: (1) a magnifier with which to see himself more clearly, and (2) a telescope with which he can see (and a te lescoping arm with which he can manipulate) that which is far aw ay. This is the aid he uses to help him reach toward Man-6 and comprehend Xem. A side observation: What is the really critical aspect of a vampire? He cannot see his own reflection in a mirror. This leaves him free to cast his gaze on what is normally hidden behind his own image. This, I suspect, is a key to Magi ster James Lewis' magical mirror, and why he must look in it when he has been seeing himS elf too much. My fangs ache at the thought. Lecture #3 This lecture starts by describing the conditions under which a school can and cannot exist. This description clearly illustrates some reasons why the Temple of Set must be as selective as it is. Those who are not truly interested in learning interfere not only with their own development, but also with that of others. T hose who wish to learn, bu t are not capable, take up time that others could be using on those with more potential, or on themselves. Also, those who think they understand, but do not, can sp read distorted ideas of philosophies and information. Ouspensky describes two kinds of influences: th ose which originated in the mainstream of life, and those which originated in schools (though maybe in rather distorted form after having been passed down for a while). Can these be comp ared to influences deriving from the natural order and those originating in th e Temple of Set? He also me ntions three \"lines\" of work within a school: One must study (work for oneself ), work for/with others, and work for the school (for which purpose he must understand the work of the school). Working for/with others is valuable only insofar as it forces one to focus one's ideas more clearly, and generally feeds back more than is being put out — or feeds back information of a nature which would otherwise be difficult to obtain. \"Working for the school\" is more interesting: (1) One works for the school to assure the school's continued existence as a useful entity for oneself. (2 ) One must understand the work of the school to understand why one should have a desire to work for the school. (3) One may work on projects of the school of a long-term na ture once he realizes that these are of a distinct future benefit to hims elf. The Cthulhu worshippers in Lovecraft's stories are to be despised if they were merely worshiping powerfu l forces and helping to bring them into more direct power for their own sake; but they may be admired if they had reason to believe that they would obtain personal power or gratification through the bringing into Being of these forces. Devil worship isn't viable, but devil mastery — or even negotiation with a devil — may have its points. It is important to have an objective understanding of what one is doing, for this purpose. I was thinking of a cute phrase: \"I have seen Se t, and he is I.\" The tr uth is the opposite. One must realize that there is something outside the \"me,\" and to do that one must first fully understand and Self-define the \"me.\" \"I have st opped looking only at my self, and in so doing have for the first conscious time known myself, and can finally look beyond.\" Thus one comes to look at whether there is perhaps an obj ective existence to that which was originally thought of as a symbol, and whether one is worki ng for that Being as well as for himself. If"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"so, it is necessary to decide what the objects of that being are likely to be — and whether these are positive, negative, or neutral toward oneself. Lecture #4 Ouspensky states that the difference in speed between the intellectual and moving/instinctive centers = 30,000; there is a similar ratio be tween the moving/instin ctive centers and the emotional center. I find the actu al figures unlikely, but the con cept seems reasonable. This has some interesting implications for magical op erations. Magic is hi ghly complex, involving many simultaneous factors: hence there isn't time to deal intellectually with all of them at once. Therefore we must train habits in ourselves — automatic processes for common operations. This is interesting, because it suggests we have to keep an open mind about \"sleep.\" Being fully awake is not always a good idea, because it implies fully conscious — hence, at least to some extent, intellectual — control of operations. This is inefficient for things which could be done just as well au tomatically. The importa nt thing is to be sufficiently aware and awake to discern to wh ich category a block of operations belongs, and then to route it accordingly. There are also some exciting implications con cerning mind travel. The intellect simply cannot keep up with the other centers. Let's postulate the speed of thought as electromagnetic in nature, hence limited by the speed of light. This isn't necessarily the right figure, but it will give us something with which to work; and it is the relationship that is important. Thus a mental/magical journey of 3.5 light-years' di stance would take at least 3.5 years on the explicitly intellect ual level, just over one hour on the in stinctive (trained) level, and 1/8 second on the emotional level. This would give the emotional center a potential speed of 28.5 light-years/second, making interste llar communication possible. Randomly placing Set at a distance of 1/2 light -year from Earth, we can make the following new hypotheses concerning Temple of Set degr ees: The Setian I° is working primarily intellectually, and may expect an intellectual-leve l response to a powerful intellectual ritual in somewhat over one year (1/2 year in each direction) , or actual results to occur in as little as 6 months. The Adept II°, assumed to have a 50% mast ery of the instinctive aspects of ritual, can expect an answer in slightly over 6 months, or results in 3 m onths. This isn't much of an improvement with respect to communication with Set, but the difference between 1 hour and 1/2 hour in the time required for a ritual Work ing closer to home can be critical — the difference between being/not being able to maintain the required concentration. Let us suppose that the Priesthood III° has made magic instinctive. The hypothetical communication with Set now takes just 17 mi nutes each way — brief enough to make the operation practical. The Master of the Te mple IV° has effectively instantaneous communication: 1/30 second. Such numbers are of course arbitrary, but they make for interesting speculation. The 30,000:1 ratio fits in well with Ouspens ky's definition of Man = Machine. Modern computers have programs (intellectual cente rs) built around instructi ons (\"instinctive\" centers), which are often defined in terms of micro-codes built-in, very tiny operations (\"emotional\" centers). Many programs today r un about 30,000 instructions. The ratio is only about 100:1 between the instructions and microc odes, but it is not di fficult to postulate a 30,000:1 ratio in the more sophistic ated robots of the future."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Understanding can be treated as a mean betw een knowledge and being. Both are necessary, and neither remains constant. If allowed to st agnate, it deteriorates . Understanding is the fitting of knowledge into the framework of a system. The \"world order\" and \"Set order\" are two very different systems, and Setian knowledge turns topsy-turvy when looked at in these different contexts. Thus even Ouspensky's \"obj ective consciousness\" may be seen to be only a relative consciousness, thus impl ying the existence of a yet higher order of consciousness in which each of the possible frameworks is merely an element in a higher order. Footnotes 1. Commentary by M.A. Aquino VI°: The above correspondence of the Setian degrees to Ouspensky's Man-1/7 reflects a specialized concept of the Setian degrees developed during the High Priesthood of Ronald K. Barre tt V°, when it was proposed that the entire system be reoriented towards an increasing appreciation of the concept of Xem, Barretts V° Word. Since then the original significance of the degrees has been restored, and each degree encompasses a great many factors beside s the study of any V° Word. Priest Cole's discussion of the IV°-VI° in particular, wh ile intriguing, is simply not an accurate reflection of those degrees. - 9/XX Symbolism The first session of the year-XXIV Order of Shuti Workshop discussed symbolism. While the study of symbolism itself is not a primar y concern of the Order of Shuti, several of the Order's activities do involve working with forms of symbolism, or are discussed using various symbols. The symbols of the twin lion gods, Shu and Tefnut , who together are Shuti, are obviously of importance in understanding the activities of th e Order. The topic of symbolism was therefore chosen for the introductory session of the workshop. Application In discussing this session and what would be discussed, the Grand Master stressed that symbolism wasn't to be discussed simply as an intellectual exercise, but that all participants should try to apply the Setian yardstick of \"application\" to this discussion. Classification: V2 - 135.A - 1 Author: Robert Menschel IV° Date:  December,  XXIV  Publication: Dialogues I.3 (1) HTML Revision: Dec 12, 1997 CE Subject:  Symbolism  Reading List: 2L, 2V"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Each and every topic of this session (and all sessions in the workshop) should be measured by the questions of a) Can it be applied? b) Is it useful? c) Does it work? What is symbolism? One answer suggested by workshop participants is that symbolism is a language of the unconscious. It is a dynamic language in which one image, a single symbol, can conjure up archetypical impressions, complex or complete concepts and/ or meanings, rather than being a structured language in which many words and/or several sentences are needed to put together an equivalent concept or meaning. Another purpose of symbolism offered by the partic ipants is to serve as a metalanguage which has two levels or multiple levels of meaning. Each symbol or set of symbols can have one m eaning to the initiated, and another meaning to the uninitiated. That symbol or set of symbols could also have different meanings to the initiated, depending upon how the symbols are communicated, and how they are mixed with other symbols. A statement in a symbolic language could even have multiple meanings communicated at the same time to the same person. A lot of the symbols Setians use in our writings are like that. When we read through the Scroll of Set or the jewelled Tablets, thos e of us who have been using the language of the Temple of Set for a while will see certain words, and will know just from the way the words are used that the author is writing symbolically as we ll as grammatically, and he therefore means \"this type of thing\". This symbolic use of language lets us add m eaning to an article wit hout adding substantially to the size of that article. Those who haven't been in the Temple of Set long enough to pick up on that symbolic use of language will miss almost all of that meaning on their first reading. This is one of the reasons why we all find it useful to reread past issues of the Scroll and to reread Tablet articles. It enable s us to read meaning in an ar ticle that we may have missed on an earlier reading. It sometimes happens that \"unintended\" meaning is found in an article during such a rereading. Even though the author may not ha ve consciously intended to convey a certain meaning, that author's Higher Self may have influenced the writing in such a way as to symbo lically give a specific message in the writing. These messages remain hidden except for those who can perceive and understand them. On the other side of the scale, if our writi ngs are read by someone totally unfamiliar with occult symbolism, then the message can be tota lly lost, and the reader may never see it."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Symbolism can be visual (example s are the Pentagram of Set, pi ctures of the Egyptian Neters, etc), and verbal (the closing we use on our letters, \"Xeper and Remanifest\", is a statement and reminder of our dedication to this Formula, a way of developing and keeping the habit of Xeper and Remanifestation going strong). Each Word itself is a symbol (Xeper, Indulgence, Thelema, etc.), as is each Neter (Shu, Tefnut, Sekhmet, Bast). A lot of principles can be used as symbols which have more meaning to the initiated than they do to those who just read about them in a dictionary. Visual and verbal/written symbols involve just one of our senses (sight). If you include verbal/spoken symbols, we then involve a se cond sense (hearing). We then asked the question, \"Are there symbols which are per ceived and communicated through each of our other senses?\" The first examples offered by workshop particip ants were incense and music: Incense can bring about different emotions and responses through the sens e of smell. Music can bring about different responses through the sense of hearing, in ways totally different than the verbal symbols do (the difference between right br ained behavior and left brained behavior). Where does symbolism come from? When dealing with incense and music, we are leaving the mental processes and intellectual reactions that visual symbols will evoke, a nd going instead to the more reactive, bodily, reactions. We react to the smell of bodily feces with distaste because of the body's reaction to that sort of an input. We find the fragra nce of a rose very pleasing. One of the reasons we use fragrant incenses duri ng a ritual is to bring about bodily reactions which enhance a ceremony because of the sm ells and our reactions to the smells. The discussion of one question leads to another. We learn the reactions / interpretations / meanings of visual and verbal symbols (at le ast those discussed above ). Do we also learn reactions to incenses and music, or are those reactions more innate? The first response was that our reactions and in terpretations, even our likes and dislikes of music are learned. The example given was classical music, whic h strikes some people as very soothing and relaxing, and which is likely to put these peopl e to sleep. But others who are aware of the intelligent dynamics and many other ingredients of classical music will find the same music very stimulating. (We believe that the workshop particip ant was thinking about the lighter cla ssical pieces, such as \"Tales from the Vienna Woods,\" and not the more active pieces such as \"Night on Bald Mountain.\") The second response disagreed with the first, poi nting out that regardle ss of whether they are used in classical, modern, or any other form of music, harps and strings tend to evoke emotional (peaceful) moods, while drums are more primal and physical, evoking more active responses."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The next example we discussed referred to the sense of smell. To a farmer, feces and fertilizer are plea sing and filled with promise, a smell of promised growth and life, a to tally different reaction than most people will have (especially after scraping a dog's refuse off the bottom of one's shoe). Similarly, an inlander's first pleasant reacti on to sea gulls on wing, grace in motion, can be compared to the reaction of t hose who live on the beach and have to live with the noise and the mess and the droppings left behind by those very same sea gulls. These examples tend to support the theory that we learn our interpretations of the sounds and smells around us. It seems from these examples that our reactions to inputs are learned, or at least they arise from our experiences. The question then beco mes, can symbols have innate visceral responses, or is the response to a symbol necessarily a learned one? To look at innate responses, the original responses to stimuli, we necessarily looked at children. For instance, children generally have no innate response to feces, and will often eat them until they learn not to. They later learn to either re act with disgust to feces , or to view them as fertilizer and the source of life. The first example of a possibly innate respons e brought to the discussion was that of the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly on the wing. N one of the participants could envision any child's reaction other than awe and delight at su ch beauty (or at least none would admit to any other vision). This brought forth remarks concerning innate ch ildish \"awe\", where al most everything is new and wonderful. Children as they begin to distinguish between the multiple events and objects in their world are simply delighted at the beauty and divers ity they find around them. There is no \"evil\" during this time — only the beauty of nature. Few of us have any reason to unl earn this initial response to th e butterfly. These reactions can therefore be considered innate, stemming from the earliest days of our consciousness. Other reactions, unpleasant reactions and also more complex reactions, seem to be learned over time. Therefore, there's some of bot h types of reactions. People will have initial reactions to many meaningful symbols and inputs, but their reactions can be modi fied by their experience and training. This discussion raised yet more questions, fo r which no answers were attempted during this workshop. The questions were, how much of our symbolism is learned, and how much of our symbolism is innate? And if some form of c onsciousness or memory can survive from one life to another, then how much might be remembered from past lives?"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Symbols may or may not come to one's attenti on. An extremely visually oriented person may not notice or respond to other type s of symbols, such as a room's smell, or a background level of music, while those who are oriented towards those senses will respond to those inputs, but perhaps not to others. Symbolism may have personal and/ or experiential meaning (such as the manure used to plant your garden or that you step in), or symbolism may be abstract (learned and used in writing, teaching, or jewelry, but not something that's impacted upon you in the past). This is the difference between a) the viscer al response, which may be inna te and may also be a learned response, modified through experience or trai ning, and b) the mental response which must always be learned or developed. The Grand Master wishes to note that the discus sion at this point had un intentionally left the strict topic of symbolism, and was dealing instead with experien ce and reaction to stimuli, on the unspoken assumption that these reactions applied to our use of symbolism. We feel this to be a valid assu mption, since the pleasant reaction we have to a butterfly or to a unicorn extends to and impacts our use of thos e images as symbols. Those with differing reactions to sea gulls as descri bed above would similarly have different reactions to Johnathon Livingston Seagull's story. Also, by concentrating on experience and reaction rather than symbolism, we temporarily lost sight of the most important measure of symbolism — that of meaning. Yes, music has impact, but that music is symbol only if its impact includes meaning, such as the sense of freedom and power that accompanie s the visual image of the \"Flight of the Valkyries\" and similar images of meaning t hose who are familiar w ith the movie will get from various pieces in the sound track from 2001. Likewise incense is symbol only if its impact includes meaning. That meaning may be supplied by the smell, or that meaning may be supplied by knowledge of the ingredients within the incense. Meani ng may also be supplied by the words used during the censing of the chambre. Without some mean ing, incense is not symbol, but only smell. Closely related to the sense of smell is the sense of taste, and it's fairly easy to see that certain tastes can have meaning as well. During Passover Seder, a ritual meal of tha nksgiving and freedom (celebrating the Exodus), Jews will dip greens into salt water and eat the salty greens, to remind them of tears shed by the Jews in bondage. They will eat bitter herbs to remind them of the bitterness of slavery. Likewise, there can be kine sthetic symbols as well. We feel different when we hold a sword in ri tual as opposed to when we hold a dagger. We feel different when we are standing up than we feel when we are sitting down, and different still when we are kneeling or laying down. We feel different in charged rooms, dry rooms, wet rooms, hot rooms, cold rooms, still r ooms, breezy rooms. Uncontrolled, these latter experiences are just stimuli. C ontrolled and used meaningfully, these latter experiences can be symbols, manipulated and understood as such."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"How should symbolism be used? The first obvious use of symbolism is in the communication of ideas, whether written, spoken, or communicated through one or more other senses. Based on the idea that a single symbol can have a whole galaxy of meaning, a useful communications skill is the ability to use symbols in the proper places, in the proper ways, to communicate more meaning in a sma ller package (with fewer words). Perhaps of greatest importance within the Te mple of Set are the magical aeonic Words: Xeper, Remanifestation, and Xem, and the pr eceding Words of Indulgence and Thelema. By using these Words in writing or other fo rms of communication, we communicate the meanings associated with those Words. If I say the word \"Xeper\" to an initiate, it means something totally different than it would mean to someone off the street, and it means something totally different to a Setian than it would mean to an Egyptologist who thinks he knows the Egyptian god Xepera. Our use of the Word is quite different and the symbol carries so much more meaning than just the word \"Xeper\" would carry in a m odern Egyptian dictionary. This use of symbolism doesn't apply just to magical Words or Formulae, but applies to symbols of many different kinds , in many different uses. You'll sometimes find certain wo rds capitalized in text, as are \"Words\" and \"Formulae\" above. When not overly used, this is a clear in dication that the author wishes you to view these words with their symbolic meanings , rather than their normal meanings. During group ritual, certain words will be spoke n more flamboyantly, perhaps louder, perhaps longer, and often with more gesturing. Th ese words are then generally being used symbolically, with special meaning at least to the speaker, if not to other participants. Symbolism can also be used in Lesser Black Magic, as tools to in fluence certain people (singular or multiple) in certain ways. The magici an (or politician or religious leader or arts director or other manipulator) will use lighting, music, fragrance, and other symbols in ways particular to their audience' s response to the symbols. Symbolism can be used upon ourselves in a sim ilar manner, to bring out responses from us that we want to bring out, as in ritual or as an aid to Xeper. Words which have become symbols to us can be used as a means of increased concentration, as a visual mantra or as a sensual mantra. Such mantras can be used in ri tual, in nonritual meditation, or whenever we choose to remind ourse lves of the principles carried within that symbol. Over time, some symbols can become richer and can carry more and more meaning to those people who work with the symbol. These symbols can become \"magnetic\", in that each use of the symbol brings forth yet another repetition of the symbol. Each referen ce brings forth a conste llation of meaning, with"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"one meaning and use leading to another. Each us e of the symbol sparks , or attracts, another use of the symbol. In these cases the symbols will often be repeat ed over and over throughout a conversation or other communication, each time exercising one or more of those meanings, and through the course of the communication this symbol can almost hold or refl ect an entire world view. This is the way the people influenced by the symbol see their world. At a political rally the symbol might be \"America\", \"Democracy \", or \"the Party\" (citizens of other countries may substitute those symbols meaningful in your domain). To some, the symbol might be \"the Environment\". The symbol \"Xeper\" has a similar im pact within the Setian culture. Group consensus is important for communication through symbols. Different groups can have differing uses of symbols, and attempts to communicate between these groups using the symbols particular to one group (or those sym bols which are viewed differently by different groups) can result in confusion or worse. Because Setians come from such diverse backgrounds, we have various communication problems related to these diverse backgrounds. Members from the O.T.O. may know all of the Qabalic correspondences, while members from the Wiccan background couldn't care less about the Qabalic attributions, and have correspondences which are totally different. Nume rologists apply different meanings to their numbers than do the Qabalists. And all of these symbolic systems work. But very, very few of them work for all Setians. Qabalists within the Temple of Set who write articles and/or letters steeped in Qabalic symbolism find that very few others care e nough about their symbols to wade through the text. Those from other backgrounds with intens ive use of symbols similarly find difficulty communicating within the Temple of Set, sinc e our symbolic vocabulary is so much less cohesive. This lack of similarity in symbolism affect s not only written communi cation, but also ritual activity. Each pylon seems to develop its own pattern of symbolism, and inter-pylon rituals can at times be very difficult. Fitting many diverse magicians with their di verse backgrounds into one meaningful ceremony can be a challenge, a ch allenge faced at each Conclave, and at each activity like the Order of Shuti Workshop."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Language of the Unconscious? (2) The first question asked by the Grand Master was, \"What is symbolism?\" The first answer rece ived was, \"A language of the unconscious.\" Parts of the workshop's discussi on might seem to support this definition, while others c ontradict it. So let th e Grand Master speak: Symbols have many attributes. Among the more important of these attributes is their ability to cau se reaction in their audience, vis ceral if not innate reactions, as discussed above. Elizabeth S. Helfman, in her book Signs and Symbols around the World , defines symbol as being: \"anything that stands for something else.\" Look in your dictionary. Mine includes seve ral definitions of symbol and symbolism, including those printed below. Symbolism is an art, a practi ce, something which is done. It is used to communicate meaning. It is a language. Our visceral responses to symbolism may be unconscious, but if that's all there is, th en have we received and/or responded to meaning? The transmission and communication of Meaning requires some form of consciousness. Let's use the word Awake to mean the highest form of consciousness. Remember — the capital letter indicates I'm using a symbol; Setian use of this specific symbol (Awake) most often refers to Ouspenski's heightened state of consciousness and awareness, a st ate of being totally awake. For simplicity, let's assign a whol e range of various levels of conscious awareness to the name \"conscious\". This name can apply to heightened states of consciousness which those we would call Awake, those that barely miss being Awake, down to the almost somnabulen t states in which most of mankind spends their day. Finally, I would call the pr econscious state one of consciousness in this case, a st ate in which meaning can be received, interpreted, and acted upon, without the individual being \"consiously\" aware that this has happened. But if the individual's attention is brought to the subject, then the symbol and its meaning can be recalled and the process repeated without any difficulty. The Grand Master wishes to digress temporarily from the workshop's discussion, and to comment at this time on one of the first statements offered during this discussion. Symbol : 2: something that stands for or suggests something else by reason of relationship, association, convention, or accidental resemblance. 5: an act, sound, or object having cultural significance and the capacity to excite or objectify a response. Symbolism : 1: the art or practice of using symols esp. by investing things with a symbolic meaning or by expressing the invisible or intangible by means of visible or sensuous representations; as a: the use of conventional or traditional signs in the representation of divine beings and spirits, b: artistic imitation or invention that is a method of revealing or suggesting immaterial, ideal, or otherwise intangible truth or states. 2: a system of symbols or representations."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"If symbols are generated and communicated, if they are transmitted and received, in one of these three states, then I believe we can corr ectly talk about symbo lism, about language. However, if the generation and/or reception of the symbol is unconscious, and/or totally unintended, then I propose that that instance is not an example of symbolism, not language or communication, but rather the accidental generati on of and/or visceral response to sensory input. [Now let us return to the discussion as it took place in the workshop...] Planetary Symbol System? We know there are differences in the meani ngs of many symbols. \"Patriotism\" can be exceedingly important to a Republican and also to a Libertarian, but the meanings that this symbol will have can be quite different in many ways. This leads us to ask the ques tion of whether there might perh aps be a \"planetary symbol system\" in which some symbols at least can be found commonly used in many or all cultures. The cross, square, circle, and most or all simp le symbols have been found in use all over the earth. We therefore can ask whether their mean ings are similar, or are the symbols used simply because they are simple geometric figur es, but with meanings arbitrarily assigned by the individual cultures? One participant brought forth Ousp enski's example that \"Table\" ha s a function, an innate form or essence, which can be perceived beyond words, and beyond a learned experience. \"Table\" provokes an image, feeling, or essenc e that is evoked through a willed perception that extends beyond the actual set of tables that a person may have ever experienced. Ouspenski claims that at a certain state of consciousness the Aware individual can see this deeper meaning or essence, and that this deeper meaning or essence can be commonly perceived by all who reach this level of consciousness. Similar ideas were offered by Plato, and the c oncept of Platonic Forms is very prevalent throughout the Setian use of symbolism. We of ten speak of the Egyptian Neters as being Forms, the original or speci fic essence of an Ideal. This is certainly an area that needs deeper investigation. The wo rkshop session discussion however left the topic of abstract Forms, and in stead investigated the hi storic use of symbols in various cultures. Looking first at the more complex god forms, it seems each major culture has a \"trickster\" god: Coyote fills this niche in several Amerindian cultures, Loki in the Norse mythos, and Thoth (Hermes and Mercury) in the Egyp tian (Greek and Roman) mythologies. The Trickster is that Spirit who makes you Think. He is the Spirit who is unpredictable in his actions or reactions, who gets himself and everyo ne else into trouble. In the process of doing so — most often after everyone is already in trouble — he ma kes people Think, and in the end he generally gets everyone out of trouble by thinking."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"To represent the Trickster, each culture used th at type of symbol or god form which for them was most appropriate for th at type of character. The coyote is a fairly independent and hard to track animal in America, requiring more than the usual amount of intelligence and stealth to catch. Monkeys similarly were appreciated for their seeming intelligence and playfulness, and so Egyptians assigned the Trickster attribute and the monkey's form to Thoth. The question becomes ... is this type of bei ng, this symbol, something which is universal, cross-cultural, or is it something which happens in just a few cases, and many other societies never had any use for it? Jung was exploring this area. He defined spec ific symbols which he felt were common to many or all cultures. They were fairly comm on within his culture and Jung did manage to validate them with some cross-cultural study. We still need to ask how complete his studies were, how extensive and wide spread. Given people in extremely diffe rent environments, such as the Eskimo, Hawaiian, Indian, Tibetan, etc., cultures where the people have many different experiences, totally different social and physical environments, it can be expected that these people would have very different reactions to the symbols th at Jung thought he had commonality on. Jung's Man and his Symbol was recommended by one participant as containing documentation on his cross-cultur al studies in this area. Not having access to any resource materials that would answer our questions at the time, the workshop session then proceeded into the topic of Egyptian Neters and the use of Neters in symbolism. Neters The Workshop discussion of Egyptian Neters star ted with a brief discussion of the Egyptian languages. The ancient Egyptians used three different wri tten languages, the hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic. The demotic language was a mostly alphabetic language used for common communications among those who could read and write. Its primary uses were for social and business reasons. The hieratic language was a pict ographic language related to th e hieroglyphic, but in which the pictographs were abbreviate d and simplified to speed writi ng. It was used for important state documents and many la ter religious texts. The hieroglyphic language was the most ornate of the three langua ges, the most ancient of the three languages, and the most symbolic. It wa s used for the most important religious and philosophical statements, and for the most important state declarations."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Many of the symbols used to form the hier oglyphic language had assigned sounds, and many others did not. In addition to the sounds and sy mbols used to form words, the Egyptians used determinatives, signs added to specifically identify each word. Through the use of the determinative, it was impossible to mistake one written word for another, even if verbal sounds were the same, even if th e letters used were the same. This use of a purely symbolic, pi cture-oriented language encourag ed the ability in the learned ancient Egyptians to th ink with right brained methods while doing the left brain activity of reading. It also encouraged these educated and intellig ent Egyptians to work with symbols as they worked with language. They were able to communicate ideas and ideals in a language particularly well suited to this purpose. Setians use the ancient Egyptian neters as sy mbols, representing aspects of the world, or aspects of the individual. We f eel this is very close to the way the higher initiates of the ancient Egyptian Temples, the priests of the Temples, and the smarter pharaohs used and viewed their neters. The neters were concepts that could be communi cated to and shared among the initiated, rather than being actual gods and goddesses. The common man may very well have believed in the literal existence of his many gods and goddesses, but we believe the elite of the Egyptia n society understood that these neters were purely symbols. When the Egyptian elite paid ho mage to the neters, they paid homage to the aspects of the universe or of the self represented by those neters. One neter of obvious importance is Set. In deali ng with this symbol, we try to identify the original meaning of the symbol, and try to elim inate the corruptions of the symbol imposed by the later rule of Osirian religion. Rather than take space here to discuss the corr uptions and distortions th at were applied to the symbol of the neter Set through th e Osirian culture, we'll simply refer the interested student to appropriate books in the reading lis t: 2A, 2E, 2G, 2W, and 2AA. It is rather clear that the us e and peripheral meanings of the neter Set changed over time. The study of Set must therefore include the careful consideration of the source of whatever writings are being studied. Fortunately most other Egyptian symbols/god forms did not change significantly over time, and such care n eed not be used in studying and working with them. The neters were used and viewed as symbols. But the Egyptian temples were temples, and were recognized as religions, not simply as centers of enlightened philosophy. This brings up the question: Do/did the Egyptia n Neters actually exist? Were these religions founded to worship or work with beings that actually existed? Or were they simply the creations of the ancient Egyptian priesthoods? Rather than tackle immediately the question of whether the Neters actually existed, workshop participants first chose to examine..."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Egyptian Priesthoods The first statement made about these priesthoods was that each temple in Egypt taught a different area of philosophy or knowledge. Those temples dedicated to a major neter or god taught that their primal Form was the First Cause. These were the major temples of the lan d, and an initiate who studied at temple after temple would be presented with the opposing claims that each god was the god, The Creator. We noted in our discussion that the priesthoods of several of the \"minor\" neters did not make any such claims. Thoth as a single neter never seemed to be treated as the creator god; nor was Geb. However, many of the major neters we re treated as creator gods, and many gods were intentionally combined into units (suc h as Amon-Thoth-Ra) in order to form a god which would be powerful enough to qualify as The creator god. Neters as Symbols We returned to discussing the neters as ways of viewing possibility a nd potentiality, and ways of viewing different aspects of the universe and of the individual. For example, Ra, the sun god, was a most perv asive and powerful being, since every single day, there he is in the sky. Ra was consis tent, reliable, and therefore powerful. Similarly each force in nature was given a personality, because each force in nature has a personality (or seems to, to those who humanize such things). This is the basic principle behind most spirits of most animistic religions. These personalities are generally reliable. A rain cloud is going to rain; it isn't going to add to the day's heat. The Nile was not going to dr y up — it was going to overflow once a year, and deposit good, rich, fertile earth upon the ground. Each force of nature, each personality, was given a name, a face, and a story. The most powerful stories, faces, and names ar e those that belong to the creator gods. There are so many creator gods, that it's really difficult to pin down an actual order of precedence. This brings up the fact that there are many appa rently conflicting stories within the Egyptian mythology. The Grand Master pointed out that in severa l Egyptian myths, Shu and Tefnut are self- created. In others they were created by tears of the master creator god (whoever he happened to be according to the story teller). In yet others they were created by the master god's masturbation. Shu and Tefnut by definition are the first male and female. The master god's masturbation in these latter stories was always male masturba tion, but Shu is the firs t male. Shu and Tefnut begat Geb and Nut, but Nut was the all-pervasiv e universal sky that preceded the first god... This confusion is the result of centuries of Egyptian story telli ng, and while some of it appears to be contraditory, most of it is useful. We cer tainly must hesitate to consider this mythology"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"as one consistent symbolism, and must be ca reful if we wish to communicate consistent meanings using these symbols, but we have found value in this mythology. Each story is a different way of looking at the world, a differe nt way of looking at the first cause, and of looking at the symbols. By using th ese symbols, we can then indicate not only a symbol, but also which way we are looking at the world. Hence, if in ritual or other communication we call upon Ptah-Geb-Nu, we are calling upon the creator of the earth a nd sky, the god who created the physical universe. If instead we call upon the Neter Ra-Ptah-ankh, we are calling upon the god who brought light and life to this planet. Having discussed these differing views of th e world as expressed by the many symbolic neters, we felt that this was a good point from wh ich to launch into a di scussion of one of the ways in which we look at Neters. Set, the prime source of intelligence and the ag eless intelligence himself, is a wee bit complex for someone a mere 20 or even 200 years old to understand, regardless of whether we look at Set as an actually existing being or instead as a master symbol. So rather than try to encompass all of Set, in tellectually or emotionally, rather than try to understand all of Set, we can work with neters which are facets of Set's being, facets of Set's symbolism. Each neter can be thought of as a specific element of Set. As examples, Shu is one set of symbolism, one se t of ideas, that an initiate can work with to \"get somewhere\" with, to accomplish certain initia tory goals. Tefnut is another set of ideas, as is Geb, Isis, etc. Rather than trying to encompass and work w ith the entire universe simultaneously, grab whatever you can hold onto, work with that ha ndful, study that symbol or symbols, and see what it leads to. We had originally intended to discuss whether or not the Neters might or might not exist in their own right. Having discussed the above, it seemed somewhat unimportant as to whether the Neters actually exist. That topi c will be left for a later discussion.

The Grand Master wishes to disgress tem porarily from the workshop's discussion and to comment at this time on one of the first statements offered during this discussion. Existentialism and Satanism In this essay I would like to discuss some of the basic similarities (and differences) between the philosophy of Existentialism (1) and the philosophical aspect of Satanism. (2) As far as I know, no specific comparison between these two philosophical viewpoints has ever been written from a Setian perspective, so I hope to be able to fill that empty spot. I was very much influenced by Existentialism before becoming involved in occultism in general and the Temple of Set in particular, and so the subject holds a st rong interest for me; I wish to present it to those Setians who are not familiar with the subject, in the hope that it may add a new dimension of information in their ever-widening pr ocess of Xeper. Classification: V2 - 149.EX - 1 Author: Eulit M. Hinson I° Date:  July,  XXV  HTML Conversion: Jan 01, 1998 CE Subject:  Philosophy:  Existentialism  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"To begin, when we speak of Existentialism, we refer to the ideas of those philosophers who take the lone individual as the starting point and main object of attention in re gard to any sort of philosophical speculation. These sorts of philosophies (3) , began in the mid-19th century with the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, who rebelled against philosophical systems such as that of Hegel, which explained man in terms of how he fit into a universal or social system, with no regards to the individual himself. Kierkegaard and Friedrich Niet zsche are usually considered as the founding fathers of Existentialism, even though Nietzsche himself do es not fit so neatly into this category, particularly in view of the fact that he never used the te rm \"Existentialism\" to describe his ideas, where as others, Kierkegaard included, identify themselves as Existentialists. In this article, however , I will be comparing Setian philoso phy to the philosophies of the two most well-known and important proponents of Existentialism in the 20th Century, namely Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre. While we could include others, for the sake of space I shall only explore the ideas of these two philosophers. Martin Heidegger termed the individual human being \"Dasein\", which means \"being there\". This term, he felt, best described the basic c ondition of the human be ing, whose basic essence is his existence , in which case this left him open to choose different kinds of Being for himself. The possibilities of what Dasein may become are the pivotal points by which he is oriented. The relationship between this view a nd that of Xeper can immediately be detected by the Setian. Heidegger was also concerned by th e concept of time as it relates to Dasein. His maqnus opus, Being and Time , centered around the relationship of time and Dasein. The entire thrust of his philosophy was concerned with the temporal ity of Dasein, that is, the transience of human existence in the physical form. Dasein has several main characteristics which incl ude (l) the priority of his existence over any essence that may be attributed to him, (2) the fact that Dasein is \"mine\", that is, my existence, and must be treated as such, and (3) his condition of \"facticity\", or the re alization of the fact of Dasein's understanding of his own being (ie: his self-c onsciousness). Given these characteristics and the realization of th em, Dasein can seek truth by means of \"unconcealment\", or the grasping of truth thro ugh the uncovering of himself. Truth is the uncovering of Dasein; therefore truth exists only as long as the individual exists. The peril of Dasein's state of being is what He idegger calls \"falling\", wh ich is the individual's becoming immersed in inauthenticity and se lf-deception. In addition to this, and since Heidegger was an atheist, he saw the basic under lying feeling of Dasein to be anxiety, as a result of his realization of hi s temporality and utter aloneness, with no God to guide or save him. The acceptance of his temporality and the absence of God becomes Dasein's most powerful motivation toward unconcealment and authenticity. Despite the conditions of anxiety and finitude, the indivi dual who seeks truth must push onward resolutely toward an authentic existence. If Heidegger's philosophy ends on a somewhat hope ful note, the exact oppos ite is true of his contemporary Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre's term for the individual human being is \"Being-for- itself\", in order to express its subjectivity, wh ile all that exists apart from the individual consciousness he refers to as \"Being-in-itself\" (adapted from Kant's thing-in-itself). Man has no nature, Sartre says, because no God exists to design one for him. Man's essence is"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"nothingness, that is, the absence of be ing. The structure of nothingness (human consciousness) is freedom or free will. Man's basic condition is freedom. He is condemned to be free, a fate from which he cannot escape; accordingly, he is responsible for all his actions. By virtue of his freedom, man chooses for himself whatever personality or nature he desires. He is an exis tence which chooses its essence, and is always in the making (becoming). Again, a relationship to Xeper can be seen. In addition to this, man's freedom places him beyond the mere personal making of himself; he is responsible for the making of a world of hi s own choosing. Owing to this realization, man is susceptible to what Sartre calls \"bad faith\", a sort of self-deception similar to Heidegger's \"falling\". A person therefore, is responsible fo r all his actions and cannot excuse himself for any reason, such as blaming his environment or heredity. There is no God; the universe is without purpose, and man is his own lawmaker. Accordingly, the fundamental desire of man is to become God, or as Sartre puts it, To be man means to reach toward being God. Or if you prefer, man is fundamentally the desire to be God... Every human reality is a passion in that it projects losing its contingency (Being-for-itself) in order to become its own foundation (Being-i n-itself) which religions call God. Thus man is a useless passion, because he is faced with the impossi ble task of becoming absolute, that is, transforming Being-for-itself into Being-in-itself. According to Sartre's metaphysical dualism of subject and object, th is is a self-contradictory situation. His philosophy ends on that ultimately pessimistic note. With the core ideas of these two philosophers ha ving been established in a basic form, I wish to proceed by examining some of the simila rities between certain aspects of these two examples of Existentialism with those of Satanism (or Setianism), as well as certain important differences. In the ideas of both Heidegger and Sartre, we see a recognition of the isolation and aloneness of the individual within the structure of the objective unive rse and its indifference to individual existence. As Satanism asserts, each individual is an isolat ed psyche within the objective universe, just as the Prince of Darkness himself is. As well, the individual Setian knows that this objective universe has no concern w ith him or her self as such, that no \"God\" in the traditional sense exists who will embrace or care for their existence. Apart from this, both Heidegger and Sartre assert that these two facts, the isolation of consciousness and the absence of God, places the individual in the unique position of having total freedom to choose his or her essence and being, since there was no divinity to make one for them. The Setian can see that this is very tr ue in one sense, that we are free to mold and choose our being in whatever form that we desi re; indeed, this is the fundamental imperative of Xeper. In another sense, the Setian can see a basic diffe rence, in that the Existentialists deny that the individual has any sort of prior essence. We who acknowledge the Gift of Set realize that our distinct senses of self-consciousness and inte lligence are the essence of our being, and this essence, the Setian Black Flame, was inculcated into human beings by an essence or being"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"other than human. This realizati on is what makes Satanism reli gious in nature rather than philosophical in a strict sense. We see that the conclusions that both philosoph ers have arrived at poi nt toward the question of the individual's ethical nature and responsibilities. Si nce there is no moral ity in any sort of absolute sense, the individuals themselves mu st create and decide upon their ethical nature. Being totally responsible for the creation of one 's own ethics and principles, the individual cannot pass this responsibility on to any sort of supposed divinity and maintain any sort of honesty and integrity. Setians will st rongly identify with this, as th ey realize that the Gift of Set has placed them in the unique role of being self-creator in every sense of the word. Also, in spite of the affirmation of having this unique ability as a result of the intervention of the Prince of Darkness in our remote evolutionary past, the Setian cannot attribute his or her behavior, whether perceived as positive or negative, to Set. Sartre goes even further, poin ting out that the individual is not only responsible for their own making, but for that of a world of his or her own choosing. I see this as an intimation of a magical view of existence, even though Sart re would surely have cringed at such a suggestion! The Setian magician knows that the world (Objective Universe, or more precisely, their perceptio n of it) is made by the Subjective Universe. In addition to this, Setians know that they onl y need concern themselves insofar as their perceptions of the Objective Universe are con cerned. The Objective Universe is neutral in nature -- neither positive nor negative; however , individual percepti on through means of the Subjective Universe has the power to make it either positive or negative. Such a view is the essence of magical perception. Both Heidegger and Sartre describe the peri ls of self-deceit and personal inauthenticity, Heidegger referring to \"falling\" a nd Sartre to \"bad faith\". This can be closely related to the views of Satanism re: the following of the Ri ght-hand Path, which is essentially a deceiving of oneself by renouncing ultimate individual re sponsibility, and attributing one's life and experiences to all sorts of imaginary causes and effects, such as \"God\", \"karma\", \"spirits\", \"entities\", etc., instead of ac knowledging oneself as the creator and sole initiator of one's existence. While Setians can sp eak of \"spirits\", \"demons\", \"e lementals\", and various other sorts of beings and entities, they understand that these enti ties are derived from and exist within the Subjective, not Objective, Universe. This is the fundamental mistake of the Right- hand Path, which ultimately leads to the dissolution of the self by virtue of a distorted point of reference. In the philosophy of Heidegger we see a strong concern with the role of time in relation to individual existence. He basica lly sees the individual as being trapped in time, a slave to its seemingly absolute power. Any Setian magician who has experienced a successful ECI (4) working knows this to be an entirely mistaken notion. While it is obviously true that our physical bodies are trapped in the space-time continuum, the mind (soul) is not bounded by it. Any time or place can be explored by the psyche which attunes itself to the essence of that time or place. That which we truly are, our ba , soul, or whatever term is used, is trans- temporal and eternal, hence not bounde d by the chain of time or space. The philosophies of both Sartre and Heidegger ar e overshadowed by a sort of dread or anxiety about what they perceive to be the ultimate futilit y of individual existence, due to the lack of any sort of absolutes or categorical imperatives. Sartre succumbs acutely to this, since he sees"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"our basic essence as nothingness. I find this to be an outrageous assertion, to say that our essential individuality and essence is the same as nothing, but let us look beyond this for a moment. Sartre says that the ba sic desire of man is to become God, but this is impossible since man is essentially a nothing (Being-for- itself), whereas a God would be a something (Being-in-itself). Here Sartre is simply bogged down in the mush of philosophical semantics, and as I said before, it is ridi culous to say that our being is composed of nothingness, since our experience directly contradicts this. Given our self-consciousness and intelligence, we are obviously something! Now, having established this, the way is cleared for the individua l in the Sartrean universe to become a god in his of her own right. There is no need for the foreboding spectre that has haunted Existentialism to any longer be an obstruction. The Aeon of Set has heralded the means whereby the individual may become his or her own god regardle ss of the Objective Universe within which we exist, since our true essence is not dependent upon or derived from it. In closing, let me say that these are only a few specific points that I ha ve covered, insofar as comparing and contrasting Existentialism and Sa tanism, but I hope that the main point has been made -- that while some aspects of Existent ialism are very useful and similar to those of Satanism, it is ultimately untenable as a means of self-preservation and development. At its best, it is an assertion of the individual's importance and primacy above all else, at its worst a retreat into despair and feelings of the ultimat e pointlessness of existence. For the Setian, the primary usefulness of Existentialism is the consid eration of those positiv e aspects of it which can be used in the pursuit of Xeper.

Erotic Crystallization Inertia Is Noesis Mystical? Classification: V2 - 156.A - 1 Author: Pat Hardy III° Date: December 15, XXIV HTML Revision: Jan 12, 1998 CE Subject:  Philosophy  Reading List: 2V, 12B, 12C"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Plato identified four levels of thought. The highest of these, Noesis, was an intuitive recognition of truth. This enlightened intuiti on was brought about throug h the development of the psyche. It is an important factor in the Setian concept of initiation. (1) Various writers have described noesis as a mystical faculty. Some infer from this that Setian philosophy itself is based on an irrational mystic ism. This questionable conclusion is based an assumption, namely, that noesis is mystical. The purpose of this article is to present an explanation of noesis that may clarify its relation to conventional reasoning ( Dianoia ). It is first necessary to consider the Pythagorean basis of Platonic thought. Pythagoras is a figure upon whom philosophy departments lavish little attention. The excellence of Pythagorean instruction cannot be denied; its products incl uded Plato, Aristotle, and others. Yet Pythagorean use of cryptic aphorisms and a symbolic method of teaching puzzles those who identify philosophy with Plat o's dialectic or Aristotle's laws of thought. Comparing the Academy of Pythagoras to m odern philosophy instruction is even more baffling: his school, and later Plato's Academy, we re open only to those with qualifications in mathematics. It is said that st udents of Pythagoras were instru cted to observe long periods of silence in their preliminary training. The oddity of this situation is explained, and the key to understanding noesis is found, in this: the philosophical heirs of Pythagoras are mathematicians . Years ago, mathematicians and logicians aban doned natural language for its tendency to introduce spooks into their work. Th eir work had impact in every aspect of modern life. Most people who have benefited or suffered from these developments know nothing of Wiener, Turing, Gödel, etc., and would be at a loss to comprehend any expl anation of their work. It is precisely because some humans have supplemente d the use of natural language that we can build spacecraft and unveil the my steries of our universe, while most of humanity continues to lurch about, incapable ev en of verbal reasoning. Natural language is a refinement of the social chatter of apes and a vehicle for the expression of reason, not reason itself . If you bind reason to natural language, you debase reason. Consider Rubik's Cube. Few huma ns could deliver a coherent description, in their native tongue, of a general solution to th e puzzle. Is the cube mystical, merely because ineffability is typical of mysticism? No! Zeno's paradox (\"Why the arrow can never reach it' s target\") is not refuted by any Aristotelian manipulation of natural language. Only in ca lculus — an artificial language focussed on immeasurable quantities(!) and temporal proces ses — do we find a tool capable of explaining observed fact. These examples illustrate the point: natural la nguage is a tool for the realm in which it evolved, namely, the natural world as our unaided senses and instincts present it to us. As we approach the limits of our unaided senses, the limits of natural language become noticeable, and in the realm of the non-natura l these limits become striking. There is a legend about Grace Hopper, a navy offi cer known for her work with computers. As she prepared to brief a group of senior officer s, she reflected that the time-unit \"picosecond\""},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"was unimaginable to most people. Yet understand ing the presentation would require a gut feel for the switching speeds of com ponents in the system under discussion. Suddenly, she saw the answer. At the briefing she distributed scraps of wire, and explai ned \"picosecond\" thus: signals could travel this lengt h of wire in a picosecond. Peopl e understood. Hopper's intuition is a simple example of noetic thought. In the terminology of de Lubicz, the picosecond-wire is a symbol , while the word \"picosecond\" is a conven tional sign bearing no necessary relation to its meaning. Noesis is not mystical, but a mode of nonverbal sy mbolic thought. Because it is not a verbal form of reasoning, it seems `superrational' and per ceptual in the terms of the verbal mind: the thought `appears' to consciousness in much the sa me fashion that an object `appears' to the eye. Yet the thought-form is subjec t to rational review and empirical use, ju st as the object seen with the eye is subject to other tests of existence. Compare the prerequisites demanded of student s by Pythagoras and Plato, and those of mystics hostile to intellect. Music theory, geom etry and astronomy are hardly needed for the abandonment of reason! We never find such th ings required by shamans, gurus, meditation instructors, priests, or other teachers of the Right-Hand Path. On this basis alone, we ought to reject the identification of Platonic noesis with mysticism. Moreover, these prerequisites share a comm on feature: each has evolved notation and formalism — an artificial language — that is no t mere jargon, but is distinct from natural language in its structure and use. Noetic insight results when the mind has been trained to think in non-natural categories. Those who do not experience this type of insight naturally express skep ticism. Some say that granting validity to an exotic, elite means of receiving knowledge opens the door to unbridled fantasy. Yet if people pass off hallucination a nd manipulation as \"noesis\" on the less-savvy, this is surely proof of deceit and ignorance, not disproof of noesis . Reason is a reliable machine; we should te st intuition. We should be equally wary of language. On no account should we reject nonverbal symbolic thought simply for difficulty of exposition. Miserable is the craf tsman who discards a screwdrive r because it is not a hammer. Footnotes 1.

Introduction Gnosis sounds very much more formidable and technical in English or German than it does in Greek. âvwåic is \"knowledge\". Gnosis is the original Greek term which means knowledge, and it is employed to designate intellectual knowledge as disti nguished from the knowledge of faith or experience. Gnosis, though it may be sometimes used in some special se nse, has a fundamental significance that is so similar to sophia as to ma ke any attempt to draw a radi cal distinction between them somewhat artificial. Gnosis, like sophia, is what theosophical writers from time immemorial have been talking about. Recognition of the importance of the concept of gnosis for Christians comes early. Clement of Alexandria specifically notes that Paul hims elf does not entirely de spise the gnosis that Classification: V4 - A156.G - 1 Author: Walter Jantschik II° Date: N ovember 20, 1981 CE Publication: Ph.D. Thesis, Un iversity of East Georgia (1) Subject:  Gnosis  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Hellenistic philosophy provides, though he deem s it to be only an introduction to the higher gnosis of the Christian Way. Philosophy teaches only \"the elementary doctrine; \" the true gnostic, \"having grown old in the Scriptures,\" is he who has atta ined that deeper gnosis that comes through agape, love, the fundamental principle of the Christian life. If we go on to ask on what authority the gnostic teachers based their doctrines, it is not very easy to give an answer. The Christian fathers are never tired of aski ng where Valentinus or Basilides got their ideas from, and on what au thority they teach their doctrines. I do not suppose that the disciple of Valen tinus or Basilides asked such que stions. Ipse dixit, they said; our master taught so-and-so. They believed in Valentinus or whoever it may have been. The term \"science\" is employed at times to refer to a body of knowledge concerning the universe or aspects of it. The sense in which I do wish to be understood definitely relates to human knowledge of the cosmos and of power within the cosmos. Inextricably involved with this knowledge is the idea of controlling, having mastery over, being able to manipulate. Hence, to know involve s the ability to contro l the material aspects and the powers of the cosmos in such a way that the knower/controller is able to derive personal benefit from this. Thus the term has to be understood as intimately related to the human mind and Will. Scientism as I employ it is thoroughly humani stic, anthropologically oriented, and man centered. Gnosticism, motivated by a spirit of Scientism, is therefore said to be man-centered and pervasively humanistic. Gnosticism speaks of the \"Pleroma,\" the spiritual man and such spiritual entities, but we must realize that th e Gnostics were basically thinking and working in terms of the material cosmos and naturalistic forces. I repeat, I do not ignore the spir itual aspects of the gnostic system s. These were there, but they were not primary in the structure of the Gnostic system. II. The Gnosis as a Philosophical Hermetism In discussing the philosophical r oots concerning hermetism, one mu st be careful to distinguish these from the philosophic character of G nosticism. Because Gnosticism is certainly philosophic in method, its emphasis on knowle dge makes it so unavoidably, it does not necessarily follow that it arose from the soils of philosophy. No student of Gnosticism will deny the philosoph ic character of Gnosticism. However, there certainly is a sharp difference of opinion as to whether or not He llenistic philosophical thought, particularly Stoic and Platonic emphasis, is a source. Harnack has stated his case clearly: \"There can be no doubt of the fact that Gnosticism, which has b ecome a factor in the movement of the history of dogma, was ruled in the main by the Greek spirit and determined by the interests and doctrines of the Greek philosophy of religion.\" Van Unnik refers to Hyppolytus who also repeat edly alleged a connecti on of Gnosticism with the schools of Greek Philosophy and questi ons the validity of the assertion."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Quispel states that Gnosticism had some Greek origins and in the Greek philosophic climate Gnosticism developed and came to varied expressi ons. This is not to be taken as agreement with Harnack that Gnosticism is the acute Hellenization of Christianity. 1. Philo, The Man and his Thought Philo, an Alexandrian Jew, was born approximately 30 BC. This places him in the times that the Romans controlled the Helle nized world of Alexander. Ph ilo is known to have written much. However the actual works extant today are said to be comparatively scarce. Philo works predominantly with the idea of the Platonic dualism. God is outside of time and space, and in His being unknowable. However, we must not forget that Philo spoke of God, the revealed One, as immanent in His relation with the universe. In th is relationship, God is \"all filling, all penetra ting, leaving no vacuum.\" Philo posit s God as the first cause on whom the world of sense and spirits depends. More im portant however is the fact that Philo posits \"mediary beings\" between the unkn owable God and the universe. The great central idea, power, and mediary mean s is the Logos, neither God nor creature, but a second God. If the various relational means are angels, the Logos is the archangel; if they are images of God, the Logos is the prime image. Through the Logos, the intermediate potencies are imprinted upon matter and serve as the relational forces. 2. The Evidence from Hippolytus Hippolytus can be considered a highly reliable source on the subj ect of Gnosis in spite of a number of problems scholars have found in his presentation. He was a Greek; he had a strong Roman environment, and he was a student and disciple of Ireneus. In fact, Hippolytus' one aim has been summed up in the following words: \"Whoever the writer of The Refutation be, he . . . formed his compilations from primitive sources, made conscientious preparation for hi s undertaking, delivered statements confirmed by early writers of note, and . . . in the executi on of his task furnished indubitable works of information and research, and of having thoroughly mastered the relations and affinities, each to the other, of the various heresies of the fi rst two and a quarter centuries. These heresies St. Hippolytus reduces to one common ground of cen sure - antagonism to Holy Scripture.\" Hippolytus deals with the various factors which definitely estab lish the scientistic motivations and impulses in Gnosticism: a) Magic. Hippolytus repeatedly refers to magi c as an integral element in the origin and source of Gnosis. b) Astrology. Hippolytus finds astrology to be even a more prevalent source for the Gnostic heresies that plagued the Church. c) Simonian thinking. Much discussion has b een raised by Hippolytus' reference to Simon Magus. d) Pythagorean influences. Hippolytus indicate s a good awareness of th e various philosophies and their specific characteristics extant in his days."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"3. The Old Gnostics First we have to name Menander, also a Samar itan by birth, a perfect ad ept in the practice of magic as the successor of Simon. Menander in many respects took ove r the doctrines of Simon, and particularly stressed that \"the primary power continues unknown to all but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth fr om the presence of the invisible beings as a saviour, for the deliverance of men.\" Saturnius of Antioch as well as Basilides are said to have arisen among Menander's followers. Saturnius promulgated a system of doctrine in Syria, Basilides in Egypt. Saturnius followed Menander quite closely in cosmological specul ations, magical practices and living habits. Basilides has given immense development to the doctrines of Menander and Simon. The next Gnostic is Carpocrates, and his a ssociates practiced al so magical arts and incantations; philters also and love potions... \"Another man is Cerdo who came to live in Rome\" and who held the ninth place in the epis copal succession from the apostles downward. Marcion from Pontus succeeded him and developed his doctrine. III. Some Basic Gnostic Methods The exact meanings of the gnostically employe d terms can only be determined by a careful study of the entire Gnostic system. On the ba sis of my study, I suggest that the following aspects of Gnosticism are properly understood if we consider the sp irit of Scientism to be the basic motif underlying all systems. 1. Cosmology The first thing to be stressed is that the Gnostics had no place for the conception of a personal God. The Gnostics did refer to the Living Father, to God, to Jesus Christ as his Son. This was strictly borrowed language put to use in th eir framework. Though the Gnostics seemed to distinguish between God and the pleroma, in fact they are indistinguishable. The pleroma is the fullness of all things. This idea of the pleroma, according to Mar kus, can only be properly understood when the Hermetic literature, which is a combination of Greek science and Egyptian lore, is studied. What then is the pleroma? It is the fullness, th e totality, the completeness of all things. From it all good has come, to it all good will return and be taken up completely in it. That what has come from it are the aeons and the \"spiritual\" se ed in some of humanity. Indirectly, all evil has come from it also. The universe, evil, a prison for the \"spiritual material,\" is conceive d of in various ways, largely depending on the acumen, imagination and source materials available to the various leading Gnostic thinkers. However, Jonas and ot her scholars agree that the universe as prison is conceived of as consisting of seven spheres, which are not perfect, circular spheres, but large, long extending arcs which are so placed th at the universe does a ppear to be a perfect sphere having seven layers. However, there is a small opening between the points of the various arc-like layers, and the spiritual man is able by gnosis to detect these, pass through each layer individually, and finally escape into the great beyond."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"2. Anthropology What is man according to the Gnostics? Jonas answers that he is flesh, soul, and spirit, mundane and extra mundane. Indeed, if we read the gospels contained in the Nag Hammadi library we must agree with these statements . However, man as thus described must be conceived of as homogeneous to the scientistically conceived dualistic cosmos. Man partakes in the good to an extent, however, his lot is to be involved predominantly in that of the evil aspects of the cosmos. In other words, man as a whole is really part of the evil aspect of the cosmos. He is really qualitativ ely of an inferior material constitution. However, mankind is divided into three categories, de pending on the quantity of the quali tative superior material he possesses. This qualitative superior, the good, is in seed form in the qualitatively inferior, the evil aspect of man. It has been implanted by one of the aeons when man accidently made by a rebellions aeon. 3. Soteriology \"For the Workman was taught by Wisdom, that he was not God alone , as he thought, and beside him there was no other, but through Wisdom he learned to know the Better (Deity). He received only elementary instruction from he r, and the first initia tion, and was taught the mighty mystery of the Father and the aeons; and he could reveal it to no one else.\" The terms used denote that the Demiurge rece ived instruction, but wa s not given the higher power or initiation, whereby he could become a teach er or initiator in his turn; he received the \"mnesis,\" but not the \"epopteia.\" This is the meaning, according to the writer, of his words unto Moses: \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and the name of God I have not made known unto them\" - that is to say, 'I have not declared the Mystery, no r explained who is God, but I kept to myself in secret the Mystery which I heard from Wisdom.' Since then the things above (in the Pleroma, Ogdoad, and Hebdomad) had been set right, by the same law of succession the things here ( on earth) were to meet with their proper regulation. For this cause Jesus, the Saviour, wa s born through Mary, that things here might be righted. Just as Christ was additionally em anated by Mind-and-Truth for the righting of the sufferings of Wisdom - without that is to sa y the \"abortion;\" so agai n did the Saviour, born through Mary, come for the righting of the sufferings of the soul. The above will give the reader some general notion of the cycle of ideas in which these Gnostics moved. IV. Results of Resear ch in Gnostic science It is very important for a stude nt of Gnosticism to realize that gnosis in Gnostic systems, in spite of a seeming myriad of denotations and expl anations, refers to the means, the instrument some men have in and of themselves. They ha ve it by virtue of thei r generation. They must take hold on this means, and use it to achieve their escape from their cosmic prison and find freedom in the pleroma."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"1. The Myth of Pistis Sophia \"In the beginning she (Pistis Sophia) was in th e Thirteenth Aeon with her companion Aeons. By order of the First Mystery, sh e gazed into the height and sa w the light of the veil of the Treasure of Light, and desired to ascend into that glorious realm, but could not. She ceased to do the mystery of the Thirteenth Aeon and ever sang hymns to the Light she had seen. Hereupon the Rulers in the Twelve Aeons below ha ted her, because she had ceased to do their mystery - the mystery of intercour se or sexual union - and desired to go into the height and be above them all.\" It may be remarked that the name Pistis-Sophia is itself a \"barbarous\" formation, not properly paralleled in Greek. There is some evidence th at the Gnostic \"Sophia\" (philosophy) was also named by other Gnostics \"Pistis\" (faith): it is only in Coptic that we find the names run together. Similarly we have \"Zorokothora-Me ljisedek\" run together; Melchisedec whose genealogy is not given in the Bi ble, is identified, not with Shem as the Jews sometimes do, but with the heathen Zoroaster, and the names are fantastically coupled. We may add that the functions assigned to Zorokothora-Meljisedek have nothing to so with those of the Biblical Melchisedec or the Persian Zoroaster! Only the mere names were borrowed by the Gnostic. 2. The Mystery of the First Mystery \"But he who shall have received the complete my stery of the First mystery of the Ineffable, that is to say, the twelve mysteries of the Fi rst Mystery, one after anot her . . . shall have the power of exploring all the orde rs of the Inheritan ce of Light, of exploring from without within, from within without, from above below, and from below above, from the height to the depth, and from the depth to the height, from th e length to the breadth, and from the breadth to the length; in a word, he shall have th e power of exploring all the regions of the Inheritances of Light, and he sh all have the power of remaini ng in the region which he shall choose in the Inheritanc e of the Light-Kingdom.\" 3. The Gnosis of Jesus th e Mystery of the Ineffable \"That Mystery knoweth why there is darkness, a nd why light.\" And so on, in the great phrases describing the wisdom of the supreme Mystery, who knows the reason of the existence of all things: darkness of darkness and light of light ; chaos and the treasure of light; judgment and inheritance of ligh t; punishment of sinners and rest of th e righteous; sin and baptisms; fire of punishment and seals of light; blasphemies a nd songs to the light; and so on through many pairs of opposites, ending with death and life. But the recital of the greatness of the supr eme Gnosis is not yet ended, for the Master continues: \"Hearken, therefore, now further, O My disciples, while I tell you the whole Gnosis of the Mystery of the Ineffable.\" It is the Gnosis of pitilessness and compassion; of destruction and everlasting incr ease; of beasts and creeping things, and metals, seas, and earth, clouds and rain, and so on working downwards from man into nature and upwards through all the supernatural realms. 4. The Degrees of the Mysteries "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The saviour answers that every one who receive s a mystery of light, any one of them, shall after death find rest in the light-world appr opriate so his mystery, but no one who has not become a Christ will know the Gnosis of the whole pleroma, for \"in all openness I am the Gnosis of the whole pleroma.\" So he who receives the first mystery of the Firs t Mystery shall be King ov er the spaces of the First Saviour in the Light-realm, and so on up to the twelfth. And Mary asks, \"Master, how is it that the First Mystery hath twelve mysteries, whereas the Ineffable hath but one Mystery?\" The answer is that they are really one Mystery; this Mystery is ordere d into twelve, and also into five, and again into three, while still rema ining one; they are all di fferent aspects or types of the same Mystery. 5. The Mysteries of Mithras The chief point of contact among the many re ligions of the Roman Empire was in the common worship of the Sun, and the inner core of this most popular cult was, from about BC 70 onwards, to be found in the Mysteries of Mithra s. \"The worship of Mithras, or of the sun- god, was the most popular of heathen cults, and th e principle antagonist of the truth during the first four centuries of our period. \" Such is the statement of one who looks at it from the point of view of a Christian ecclesiastic, and indeed the Church Fathers from the time of Justin Martyr onward have declared that the devil, in the Mysteries of Mithras, had plagiarized their most sacred rites by anticipation. The Mithriac Mysteries represented the esoteric side of a great international religious movement, which the uniting together of ma ny peoples into the Graeco-Roman world had made possible, and which resulted from the cont act of Greece and Rome with the thought of the East. 6. The Mystic Diagrams It is very probable, therefore, that in these diagrams square s may represent treasures or the substance-side, while circles may represen t gods or the energy-side - but these can interchange, for the substance of one plane or phase becomes the energy of the plane below. The three strokes seem to represent the potential triad or trinity latent in all manifestation, and this triad acting within the tetrad of the square s produces the infinite ordering into twelves or dodecads. We should also recollect that in al l probability we have only a very faulty reproduction of these diagrams, for we have to take into account the translating and copying and re-copying by ignorant scribes. The three lines are said to be three Voices wh ich Jeou will send forth when he is ordered \"to praise the Father,\" that is to sa y, to emanate, for this is how th e creative song of praise is sung. 7. 'scInäOçscä XPIäTOä With reverence and godly fear this great central name and number of the Gnosis must be approached. But let not any faithful Christian read er fear lest he or she be too unlearned and ignorant, or too non-graduate a nd amateur to grasp the very simple structure on which the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"mathematical element is based. This little tabl e shews the differences of the cubes of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and it is the last of the series, namely 37, which furnishes the framework on which the Holiest of Names are built. As Will be seen below, this mystical 37 may be displayed as a geometrical figure, and this figure I term the \"metacube.\" As an aid to me mory, I term it METAKçBON, the Gematria of this word being 888 = 'InäOçä, Jesus. 1 u. 7 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 (or 1ü u. 7 = 2ü). 8 u. 19 = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 (or 2ü u. 19 = 3ü). 27 u. 37 = 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 (or 3ü u. 37 = 4ü). änæîçov æîçàkváov, or the cube-difference sign, will give the number 1271, 'n yvwåic. The Figure of the Metacube is coupled with the Name of Jesu s Christ and its number is 2368, on which there exists an indubita ble consensus of meanings in the large Gematria discovered upon it. 8. The Truth A great many philosophers have of ten already paid serious atten tion to this problem, and we also will have to approach this task. We shall deal here only w ith such kinds of truth we must be informed about thoroughly. Truth depends on the insight of each individual. And as we cannot, all of us, have the same insight or perception, it is impossible to generalize the problem of truth. Therefore from his standpoint and in conformity with the degree of his maturity, each one will have his own truth, providing he sees it quite honestly. Only he who knows and masters. the absolute laws of the microcosm and the macrocosm is entitled to speak of an absolute truth. Certain aspects of the absolute truth w ill be surely acknowledged by everyone. Nobody, indeed, will doubt that there is life, volition, memory, and in tellect, and will refrain from arguing about these facts. No sin cere adept will impose his truth to anyone who is not yet ripe for it. The person concerned would do nothi ng else but regard it again from his own standpoint. Therefore it would be useless to argue with nonpr ofessionals on higher kinds of truth, excepting people eager to search the heig hts of truth and begi nning to ripen for it. Anything else would be a profana tion, and from the magic point of view, absolutely incorrect. At this point all of us will have to remember the words of the great Master of Christianity: \"Neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet.\" To truth belongs also the capac ity of correctly differentiati ng among knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge depends, in all domains of the human existence, on the maturity, receptivity, and understanding of the mind, and the memory without regard to whether or not we have been able to enrich our knowledge by readi ng, transmitting, or other experiences. There is a wide difference between knowledge and wisdom, and it is much easier to win knowledge than wisdom. Wisdom depends not in the least on knowle dge, although both are identical up to a certain degree. The source of wisdom is in God, that is to say in the causal principle (the akasha), on all planes of th e grossly material, astr al, and mental world. Therefore wisdom does not depend on mind and memory, but on the maturity, purity, and perfection of the individual personality. Wisdom could also be considered as a developmental"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"stage of the \"ego.\" Therefore insights are not passed on th rough the mind, but - and this particularly - through intuition or inspiration. Th e degree of wisdom is therefore determined by the state of developmen t of the individual. This will not mean, of course, that we ought to neglect knowledge; on the contrary, knowledge and wisdom must go hand in hand. The ad ept will therefore endeavor to get on in knowledge as well as in wisdom, for none of th e two must lag behind in development. If knowledge and wisdom keep the same pace in deve lopment, the adept is enabled to grasp all the laws of the microcosm and the macrocosm, not only from the point of wisdom, but also from the intellectual side; that is to say in a bipolar way, namely to perceive and utilize them for his own development. The first main key is the secret of the te tragrammaton called YOD-HE -VAU-HE or the four- pole magnet. Being a universal key, it can be used to solve all problems, all laws, all kinds of truth, in short, everything, pr ovided the adept knows how to use it properly. As time goes on and his development unfolds and he is advanci ng in hermetics, he will be acquainted with many an aspect more of this key, and be for ced to accept it as an unchangeable law. He will no more wander in darkness and uncertainty, but he will carry a torch in his hand, the light of which will penetrate the night of ignorance. This brief summary will suffice for the adept to in struct him how to deal with the problem of truth. 9. God Since the remotest ages, Mankind has alwa ys believed in something beyond human understanding, something transcendental he idol ized, no matter whether there was question of personified or unpersonified conceptions of God. Anything man was unable to understand or to comprehend was imputed to the powers above su ch as his intuitive virtue admitted them. In this way, all the deities of mankind, good and evil ones (demons) have been born. As time went on, gods, angels, demiurges, demons, and ghos ts have been worshipped irrespective of their having ever been alive in reality or their having existed in fancy only. With the development of mankind, the idea of God was sh rinking especially at the time when, with the aid of the sciences, were explained phenomena ascribed before to the gods. A lot of books would have to be written if one wished to enter into details of the various ideas of God in the history of the nations. Let us approach the idea of G od from a magician's standpoint. To the plain man the idea of God serves as support for his spirit just not to entangle himself in uncertainty, and to get out of his depth. Therefore his God remains alwa ys something unconceiva ble, intangible, and incomprehensible for him. It is quite otherw ise with the magician who knows his God in all aspects. He holds his God in awe as he knows himself to have been created in his image, consequently to be a part of God. He sees his lofty ideal, his first duty, and his sacred objective in the union with the Godhead, in b ecoming the God-man. The synthesis of this mystic union with God consists in developing the divine ideas, from the lowest up to the highest steps, in such a degree as so attain the union with the universal. Everyone is at liberty to abandon his individuality or to retain it. Such genii usually re turn to earth entrusted with a definite sacred task or mission."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"In this rise, the initiated magician is a mys tic at the same time. Only performing this union and giving up his individuality, he voluntarily enters into di ssolution which in the mystic wording is called mystic death. It is evident that true initia tion knows neither a mystic nor a magic path. There is only one initiation linking both conceptions, in opposition to most of the mystic and spiritual schools which are dealing with the very highest problems, through medita tion or other spiritual ways, without having gone through the first steps at first. This would be similar to somebody starting with the university studi es, without going through the el ementary classes first. The results of such a one-sided training, in some cases, are disastrous, sometimes even drastic, according to the individual talents. The error is generally to be found in the fact that most of the matter comes from the Orient, where the material as well as the astral world is regarded as maya (illusion), and consequently paid little atte ntion to. It is impossibl e to point out details, for this would overstep the frame of this thesis . Sticking to a carefully planned, step-by-step development, there will be neither a mishap nor a failure or bad consequences, for the simple reason that ripening takes place slowly, but surely. It is quite an individual matter, whether th e adept will choose as hi s idea of God Christ, Buddha, Brahma, Allah, or someone else. All de pends on the idea, in the initiation. The pure mystic wishes to approach his God only in the all-em-bracing love. The Yogi, too, walks towards one single aspect of G od. The bhakti yogi keeps to the ro ad of love and devotion; the RAJA and hatha yogi choose the path of self-control or voliti on; the jnana yogi will follow that of wisdom and cognition. Let us regard the idea of God, now, from the magic standpoint, according to the four elements, the so-called tetrag rammaton, the unspeakable, the supreme: the fiery principle involves the almightiness and the omnipotence, th e airy original principle owns the wisdom, purity, and clearness, from the aspect of whic h proceeds the universal lawfulness. Love and eternal life are attributed to the watery principle, and omnipresence, immortality, and consequently eternity belong to the earthy princi ple. Thee four aspects together represent the supreme Godhead. V. The Gnosis as a hermetic science can lead to new-thinking Man is a mixture of spiritual and material com ponents. The spiritual ones are the cause of his longing to return to God. This is an old way of expressing a basic tr uth discovered in all religions that have any sort of mo ral development in them at all. People learn the need to cultivate what we call the inner or interi or life. Indeed, every form of humanism that has any religious content to it, such as the huma nism of Socrates and that of Confucius, recognize that there are certain t houghts and actions that degrade men and women and others that elevate them. Surely these propo sitions are as unspecific as any in the history of human thought. I can think of no great philo sophy or religion to whose adherents the two propositions before us would not seem to be fundamentally platit udinous, noble platitudes though they be. That is not to say, of course that all would be cont ent with the mode of expressing the platitudes. The mind-matter dualism generally leads to a se verely ascetical manne r of life, though it can also lead to a libertinism that is the very opposit e. To some extent however , this is true of all forms of religion that have anything to say of human conduct at all. It is well-known that."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"religious people do tend to be, on the one hand se vere, restrained, disciplined, sometimes even to the point of self -cruelty, or, on the other, notabl y gentle, easygoing, broadminded. All religious recognize that the flesh, whatever g ood may or may be said of it, can be a snare. Gluttony and lust can make beasts of men and women. Even the least religiously-minded person can sometimes reproach himself with the re flection, \"I did make a pig of myself at that buffet dinner.\" Gnosticism appeals to the desire to belong to an el ite. To be elect is to be elitist willy-nilly. To be saved is to be in one way or another singled out. Even thos e religious that claim to be thoroughly internationalist have elitist structures: the monas tic way is for those who are willing to follow certain counsels of perfection. The gnosis is attained basically through experien ce of life over the course of millions of lives. Books and teachers are at best but midwives to gnostic awareness. When Bianchi and others suggest that Gnostic ism always appears as a parasite on a living religion, they surely fail to see that their slur on Gnosticis m could apply equally well to existentialism and be equally ill-founded. It is a well-known paradox th at many of the most illustrious Gnostics, mystics, and existentiali sts tend to be peculiarly well-rooted in a particular institutional religion while not only tr anscending it but dramatically vitalizing it. Clement of Alexandria, Teresa of Avila, Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Berdyaev are examples that spring readily to mind. None could be less pa rasitic on their respect ive traditions. On the contrary, without men and women of this caliber, the traditions out of which they have sprung would have dried out long ago. The truth is, indeed, the other way ar ound: it is the Gnostics and the existentialists, the mystics and the relig ious humanists, to say nothing of the heretics, to which the Church is indebted for its surviv al. Too often the parasites are the institutions that survive through sucking, however inefficien tly and therefore in th e long run fruitlessly, from those superabundantly life-filled sources. VI. Conclusion My initial intention when I began the study of Gnostic probl ems was to study the Gnostic documents produced by various Gnostic writers. Th e particular interest was in the cosmology, Anthropology, soteriology, and eschatology of men as Philo, Hippolytus, and the Old Gnostics. It was imperative to study the origin and mo tivations of the various Gnostic movements. Hence the immediate interest was turned primar ily from the actual documents produced in the third to fifth centuries to those sources availa ble for study which arose fr om or dealt with the material from the first and second centuries. In fact, the author has found that Gnostic herme tism particularly is a sc ientifically oriented phenomenon, and is shaped and colored by the spirit of Scientism. The intent of this study would be to determin e in how far much what could be termed as twentieth century Christian theology - i. e., theology proper, cosmology, christology, soteriology, and eschatology is basically oriented to, pervaded, and c ontrolled by the modern scientific spirit, mind, and method."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"How long must it be before we le arn that there are as many ways to worship God as there are men on earth? Yet each man still declares: My way is best; mine is the only way. Or if he does not say it, he things it. These things, it is true, transcend our reason; religion is the something in us greater than our reason, and be ing greater it gives gr eater satisfaction. To save ourselves we must lose ourselves; though not irrationally, if reason is transcended. If it be true that we have lived for many lives before, in ways how many must we not have worshipped God or failed to do so? How often have we c ondemned the way we praised before! Intolerant in one faith, equally intolera nt in another, condemn ing our past selves! What, then, think ye of Christ ? Must He not be a Master of religion, wise beyond our highest ideals of wisdom?

On ethical grounds I decided to fulfill my conscription in th e form of \"civil servic e,\" which is the only legal alternative to ordinary military service in Finland. On duty, many new and fascinating questions on the nature of the aggressiveness of the human being were brought to my mind, especially those deal ing with the sociobiological view, which (though it often consists of rather contradictory doctrines) is held high by such L.H.P.imagery utilizing groups as the Kenne l of Satan, Abraxas foundation, O.N.A. and O.L.H.P. The purpose of this article is to discuss aggres sion in human beings from the sociobiological vantage point and in general. I. The sociobiological view of human nature All in all, most modern scientists are of th e opinion that if man were composed only of adaptivity, capacity for learning, and desire for satisfaction, these (and an y others) would have to be hereditary qualities typical for the species, based on some anatomico-physiological structures. When mechanistic modern science, which dr ifts farther and farther away from the phenomenon of life, has focused on the self conscious man who goes beyond the material interface, \"consciousness\" has been attempted to be explained as being purely a product of the central nervous system. This has not at all su cceeded satisfactorily, and so the problem has remained unsolved. Throughout history, concepts of the essential nature of man have been misused to defend many kinds of political ideologies and worldview s (among others the Inquisition, dialectical materialism, Third Reich, and religious wars). After Darwin's Origin of Species arose one such concept name d \"sociobiology\". This doctrine tries to prove and justify that \"man is in essence a warlike animal.\" Sociobiology maintains that the origin of militancy and nationalistic fe elings is biological, which I think may be so. Subject:  Aggression  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"There is a flaw in the materialistic interpre tation of the fundamental nature of the human being, though. Throughout this article I have sprinkled comments on sociobiology, both for and against, depending on the context. The inference pattern of sociobiology is a simp le one: \"Because there have always been wars at every stage in history, that's how it must be in the future, too. It is in accordance with man's heredity that he fulfills his essential nature, that he fights.\" Such claims as this contain at least two fallible holes: (A) It can be questioned whether man needs to re alize something that is \"biologically natural\" for him. A mediocre man may be said to be la zy, but one cannot ban work on the basis that \"it is against our biological nature.\" With some justification it can be claimed that the tendency to preserve the species is more \"natural and biological\" than destroying it. To change the present destructiv e direction of our cultural ev olution, revealed already by the first report of the Club of Rome, man must use his nonnature for the preservation of his species. Such uses would include stopping warfare, which is one of the five changes that are necessary in order to stop the destructive current (the others being stopping population growth, switching to a durable energy ec onomy, ecologically sane production, and ensuring balanced use of natural resources). Stopping warfare should be considered one of th e most central efforts of modern times. Twenty generations ago commitment to warfar e dominated the forerunners of our cultural evolution. To protect our living conditions we should try to disengage from warfare. In contradistinction, our parents attempted to stre ngthen their living condi tions by fortifying the state to be a warmachine. (B) Sociobiologists use loose arguments when they pronounce judgements concerning what is a part of man's heredity. Sociobiological studi es do not fulfill the normal critical demands of science. There should be more explicit theoretic al and empirical work, rather than general statements based more on the opinions of the writ er than on scientific findings (See chapter III). It can also be pointed out that even though the social conditions wh ich engender wars are created by human beings, wars occu r only in certain circumstances, i.e.: when there is a lot of inequality and oppression. And even though th ere was always a war going on someplace in the world, this wouldn't confirm th at all people do it, or that they do it all the time (See chapter III). When an etologist describes the behavior of a species of animals, he bases his description on his observations on specimens and groups of the species in question. From this emerges the conception of what is normal and natural. In comparison with animals, man behaves very irregularly. Montaigne on ce wrote that \"there is as much difference between us and ourselves as between us and ot hers,\" and we all do remember Crowley's formula \"Every Woman and Ev ery Man Is a Star.\" If an etologist were"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"to describe man's behavior, his description woul d not focus on hereditary characters, rather on socially generated modes of conduct. II. Aggression as an instinct Next I will consider the so ciobiological statement that man's war-like tendencies are biologically induced. I will do this by seeing whet her aggression meets the five criteria of an instinct (or drive). 1. The so-called storage or accumulation theory claims that when a certain level of drive energy has accumulated, it will leak over. No physiological indicators have been found for aggression. In no studies has it been proved that aggression energy woul d diminish after the \"discharge\". More likely it is the opposite way around: it has been noted to further later aggressive behavior. Aggression is always a reaction to some situation or problem, it is a social course of action. 2. Catharsis theory claims that aggressive outbursts are foll owed by a relieved feeling. But this is no proof. Of course it is easier to express one's feelings as they are, and not fake being happy. Another enlightening example: Mrs. X has been promised to be invited to a party. When she doesn't receive the invitation at the appointed time, she gets mad. Immediately after this she gets the invitation and th e need to discharge disappears. 3. One traditional criterion for an instinct is that if behavior is determ ined by the instinct, the reaction must not be learned, ra ther the organism should have it as its birth right. In this respect aggression has a double nature. Everyone has it as a potentiality. Anatomical structures and functions connect ed to them have been \"genet ically\" programmed into us. On the other hand, learning has a decisive role. The future disposition to be aggressive is closely related to the following upbringing conditions: The use of corporal punishment, lack of warmth and love, incomplete identification with parents, car elessness, and irrationality. Life's appearance as \"meaningless\" stems basi cally from man's materialistic concept of himself. If his innermost nature were merely biological, complete fulfillment of his appetites and the acquiring of wealth would satisfy his longing for happiness. Since they do not, an atmosphere of hopelessness is enveloping our generation, especially our youth. Happiness love and compassion are spiritual facu lties that during centuries of neglect and misunderstanding have withered an d grown weak. Unless they are nursed back to health, man will despair of life and eventual ly throw it away in a mass suicide by nuclear destruction. But how can we care for what we no longer comp rehend? Modern science, admirable in its achievements on a material plane, has proven in effectual in the understa nding of intangible values. (1) 4. Sociobiologists suggest that genes determine the level of aggressiveness. This is not easy to accept on the light of scientific f acts. Genetic inheritance gives an individual full possibilities to develop into an aggressive person, but as was pointed out in the previous section, learning has a crucial role in the genesis of aggression. On the other hand, I cons ider it quite possible that we still have genetic imprints from th e time when we \"ran hunting, killed the prey, and felt satisfaction and pride because of it.\""},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"5. The last criterion is that fo llowing its instinct should be a pr imary sanction to an organism; an organism should strive after this form of be havior for its own sake, not in order to reach some other objectives via it. The behavior in question should then be satisfactory per se. Hunger, thirst, and sexual intercourse fulf ill this criterion; aggression doesn't. III. Human qualities that lead to war Although aggression is one element in social relati ons of human beings, it cannot be said to be the power leading to war. Intelligence, handicraf t, and speech/language have been decisive in our cultural evolution and at the same time in generating warlike qualities. These characteristics have enabled (among other things) better communications and military technology. If we take into account as a criterion an inner state of aggression, it is found that war, for the most part, happens without aggression. Politicia ns and common soldiers are rather seldomly aggressive, and even when they are, their a ggression is not in propor tion to the destruction they cause. The politicians that decide on war do it on th e basis of political, economical, and common interests, not on the basis of aggr ession. If man were \"just anothe r animal,\" he would be rather curious in the sense that with in other species there is pr obably no violence without an aggressive inner state. War depends on the politics preceding war, and a ccording to Clausewitzian thinking it is the natural extension of politics to achieve certain aims. War arises from structural violence, and therefore weapons and soldiers cannot be said to cause war in themse lves, although they are no good in preventing it either. An army and its g uns is a vehicle of poli tical leadership, and it is used to achieve political aims when suitable. In other words, politics is action, a natural part of which is the possibility of military action. Arms are manufactured and armies sustained in order to back \"normal\" politics. Politicians have a greater responsibility for wa rs, for the political leadership does make the decision to begin a war. Because wars are a product of politics, preven tion of war depends on changing the policies. The aims that have seemed selfevident must be a ltered if they have led to war. In this respect even an ordinary citizen can make a differen ce (f.e.: civil service as a comment to support politics less prone to warfare). The reason why decisionmakers decide to start wa rs and why other citizens agree to take part in arms race and warfare is economical, a nd depends also on structural conflicts. Men take part in designing and making weapons for the simple reason that it provides work. Scientists have in addition to this the motive to further their career. Most human beings are passive and lack judge ment. And without docility, suggestibility, and fear of the enemy, wars wouldn't be possible. Fear is a more common emotion in war than aggression. In addition to thousands of years of tradition, war-like me ntality is supported by fear of unknown conditions and customs, suggestibil ity, inability to thwart feelings of guilt, and most importantly the tendency of inne r conflicts to turn into violence."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"To the rise of inner conflicts contribute for example modern man's trivial spiritual level, communication disability, the fact that cultur al evolution has neglected the spiritual, the greater pace of living rhythm and change in the midst of \"social buffers\" (families), their growing inability to resist blows, the result be ing that the individual su ffers all the more little \"shocks\" all the way to the Futu re Shock of Alvin Toffler. Altruism, which began as the product of the natura l order, and which still lingers in us, is now being misused by politicians, many religions, and mass movements. Man's social nature is an old thing, and the core family, which was so im portant already in the days of the herdlike dawning selfconsciousness, has been the basis of human relations duri ng all the existence of the cultural man. As the group's cooperation developed along with hunting, it served man well. But now it has turned against us. Strong instinct for mutual helping may imperceptibly be excited also in aggression situations within the species. Faith fulness in hunting has become faithfulness in battle, and war has started. The deeply rooted development of the inst inct to help one's comrades has ironically been the reason for the greatest horrors of all wars. (2) From the vantage point of information sciences, an interesting observation about aggression is that the so called destruction component is visi ble in the product of th e behavior, but is not seen in the state of the indi vidual. The individual is always more or less programmed by a purely informational state (f.e.: one needs to fell a tree). The point is that the means of transferring information are va ried. Aggression is then more the product of a means of communication than a property of the message to be communicated. A child whose method of communication has not developed well screams, waves, and drops things in order to get attention or nutrition. An adult w ho has learned the basics of in formation transfer is tempted to use primitive methods when he doesn't understa nd or is not in control of the prevailing situation. Most people are locked at the persona level. The persona can he understood as an impoverished selfimage, which has been created when the individual has denied some of his characteristics, such as hate, joy, or sexualit y. But characteristics won't disappear if they are neglected/denied, only the understand ing that they are a part of one 's self is dimmed. Thus is formed the shadow, a conglomeration of forbi dden qualities, and over the line created begins the battle between the pe rsona and the shadow. After the line has been drawn, the properties of the shadow are conceived of as part of the outside world; they are projected there. The impulse that is formed within the individual is felt to come from the environment and be directed towards the person. Proj ection has two results. On the one hand the individual feels that he l acks a certain component that he has projected outside. On the other hand the characteristic now seems to be in the world outside, most often in other people. Most people have a strong resi stance against recognizing this distorted self- image. Resistance has in fact originally been one of the cen tral reasons for projection. The most significant examples of the projection of the shadow Wilber finds from the witch hunts, the raid of the Jews by the Nazis, and the Ku Klux Klan. He also reminds of the fear that prevailed during the cold war that 't here is a communist under every bed.' (3) I think that projecting the gene tic memory of the core family/group into a larger framework, plus a many-sided propaganda, make fo r so called nationalistic feelings."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"In all societies there is much more peaceful activity than military actions. Social faculties, taking care of others, rational endeavors, and other qualities that sustain and improve a peaceful society are typical for human beings in particular, as are setting values and goals and striving after them. IV. Aggression and selfconsciousness Scientifically, aggression is defined as \"beh avior deliberately hurting or disturbing another individual or the environment.\" Can our selfc onsciousness, which is capable of all the above- mentioned, be considered inherently aggressive? The path of finding oneself begins from the Will to Become, which manifests as dissatisfaction with one's prevailing level of being. The present level of our being we can observe, test, train, and manifest (initiate) th rough our body in the objective universe, where society provides many good tools for our Xeper . The main point is that \"the physical body provides a vehicle in which the psyche can beco me aware of itself and then reach out toward the limitlessness of its conscious existence.\" (4) Selfconsciousness is not aggressive in itself. I do n't think it is passive or active; its essence is \"neutral\" and unbound by matter. It is entirely up to the individual Will to Become, and dependent on that whether a given indi vidual achieves dynamic enlargement of his consciousness. I think that in ou r souls, and maybe in our genes as well, is an ancient \"rough, cruel, beastly\" component. It is an urge, a For ce, which I suppose was formed at the dawn of our self-consciousness, and which if repres sed, misunderstood, or mischanneled can have aggressive, violent manifestations. We must be aware of it, keep it under control, and w ith our most exalted self guide and use it as an energy thru which to achieve Tr ue knowledge, altered successive states of consciousness. These will allow us to gradually enter deeper into the Mysteries of our self, our dynamic Becoming. According to my present understanding one can find in the formula \"Blood is Life\" some allegorical dimensions to the above. As we Setians Xeper , we Become more and more conscious of ourSelves, the objective universe, and the patchwork quilt of subjec tive components that covers it. We create ourSelves more and more real, free, and effec tive. As consciousness is enhanced, also our responsibility stretches fu rther and further and to more delicat e matters than before in all that we do. Because a self-conscious human being is not \"just another animal,\" his freedom is essentially tinged with responsibility. V. On Morality By supporting and trying to justify \"man's ba sically violent animal nature,\" sociobiology supports the idea that \"strong surviv e and weak perish.\" They claim this is as it should be, if \"natural balance and cosmic dialectic\" is to o ccur. [One could remark to sociobiologists that weapon technology and manufactur e have followed their own evolution, and that the havoc wrought by weapons no longer in any way depe nds on man's aggressiveness. The present mass destruction weapons neither choose \"biologi cally strong\" or \"weak\", which nullifies the expectations of a better race held high by soci al Darwinists. Moreover it can be shown that"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"man's \"biological evolution\" has for the most been degeneration, physical weakening, whereas intellectual evolution has been real.] Here we drift out of the reach of one of a c onscious human being's central concerns, morality. I am of the opinion that \"Satanists\" singing their gospel to sociobiology, and supporting its ideology, raise their voices to favor cosmic dial ectic. This is paradoxical, because at the same time they slander Christians and those of ot her religions about th eir global missionary enterprises, and consider them a hindrance to the cosmic dialectic. T hus they neglect that these also have their useful place in society \"f or organizing and maintain ing natural structures in society, in the objective universe, and within those segments of th e subjective universe of the believer which still may be dependent on organic models.\"+ (5) It is easy to put sociobiologica l views to the same sledge with the philosophies of Hegel and Marx. The point of departure is that histor y has a mind of its own, distinct from the individuals who give him it. Indi viduals can either mould themselves to suit the natural flow of history or go against it. A progressive aim means simply furthering and following a certain direction, the direction of history. Even if history had an aim, who would decide on it? To Marx this was no problem. The aim of history was seen by the political party, the political front, which had a prerogativ e to historical truth. For Marx the struggle of the classes was a rout e, collective journey, wh ere the units were not individuals but classes. Individuals were defined solely on th e basis of their class. Marx had a theory on morality which claimed that mora lity was an ideology, false consciousness. He claimed that morality meant only rationalizing wh at was advantageous to the ruling classes. This is why morality was to be demystified. The same elements are to be found with othe r names from the ideas of \"Satanists\" who support sociobiological ideologies . A couple of direct quotations from an article by Kerry Bolton of O.L.H.P.: 'God': the cosmic, creative energy, a pervasive force. 'Satan': the cosmic principle or mechanism which activates that 'godforce', to cause change, evolution, destruction, creation. The cosmos, because of this Satanic element, is not passive; it is dynamic. Whether that dynamism is reflected as evolut ion or destruction and degenera tion is something that man can actively determine by his own intervention, thro ugh the Satanic spark of self-will that was bequeathed to him. When man misuses his Satanic or Promethean Gi ft as the result of corruption by Christianity and other such moral slush, the fine ba lance of this world is disrupted. Famine, and often war, are the Satanic mechanisms activated to restore the balance. This is the mechanism the humanitarians seek to overc ome through their moral conceit. What is the Satanist answer to problems such as famine and overpopulation? To le t things take their natural course. Let Satan send his grim reaper to ravage a land with war and famine until balance is restored. But nature is selfcorrecting, impersonal, amor al, and what we have called the 'Satanic mechanism' intervenes to restore balance, which may take either creative or destructive forms."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"With good reason we can ask where were left an individual ethic created within the framework of society's laws, choice, and most of all the basic concepts of choosing one's self. This way the role of the moral reason so peculi ar to human beings is nullified what comes to choices, behavior and evaluation. VI. On Patriotism To the Satanist, martyrdom and nonpersonalized heroism is to be associated not with integrity, but with stupidity ... to give one's lif e for something as impersonal as a political or religious issue is the ultimate in masochism. (6) The central concept of modern national ideology is a people, not being under the rule of a certain ruler or living in a certain geographical area. I think the \"right\" kind of patriotism means valuing one's own ethnic culture, cultural tradition, and its freedom. I have noted that when I'm asked by the prof ane for the reason why I chose civil service instead of military service, the question is almost always narrowed down into the issue of nonviolence. The question is rather about the eff ects of various abstractions, such as native country, nationalism, political leadership, power, obligations and rights, life, and so on. As a social being man has, depending on his place in society, some re sponsibilities in addition to his rights. In my view my responsibilities do not include, in the case of a war that occurs for reasons not having anything to do with myself, risking my life for the country in which I happen to live. VII. On the future of mankind Being better equipped to live at a biological le vel is a concept that doesn't depend on values while progress is a valueladen concept. If humanity wished to pull itself up regarding its environment and its own spiritual down fall, it should rech eck its values. I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens towards an annihilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid. And alone I ca nnot preserve my Elect, but I would teach them and strengthen their Will against the co ming peril, that they and their blood may endure.

These terms provoked my curiosity. After looking into them as they are used by traditiona l occultists, I turned to psychology for deeper understanding. The use of handedness terminology to designate entire segments of political and occult thought is profoundly related to the latera l specialization of brain function. I've heard explanations for the bad rap taken by le fthanders that involve deceit (being able to use a weapon skillfully in the left hand when most people display an open right hand as a sign of nonagression) and hygiene (in the days before toilet paper). But th is doesn't go far enough. Because speech is the major mode of communication employed among people, the verbal mind is the predominantly public, or social, part of the personal ity. Thinking is often portrayed as speaking to oneself ! And the presence, or absence, of appropriate words exerts limits on what can be discussed. (1) So, when you talk to a standard left-hemis phere-dominant human being, you expect that you are talking with somebody who also has an internal-dialog model for thinking. Sometimes you can even see when they hand off control to the other hemisphere for solution of a spatio- temporal problem — they change eye focus or direction of gaze. Yet, it is possible to envision m odes of hemispheric inte raction that entail very different types of thought processes. Julian Jaynes tried to ma ke a case for this in his book The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind , using anthr opological and archeological evidence.

In such a mode, \"I am walking to the st ore to buy food\" vanishes in a set of temporal and spatial inversions: • aversion to hunger expectat ion of satisfaction • none here some there • walking east walking west • going coming • empty-handed carrying groceries • abstract value (money) concrete value (food) Observe that in this table, the \"I\" that is pe rforming a particular action to accomplish a result is not found. If it exists at all, it does so as pa rt of the matrix function transforming the first set of conditions into the second. Conversation with an in dividual thinking in this fashion might be hampered by a number of difficulties. Such a perspective entails, among other things, a radically altered view of causality. To take an example which is famous , and illustrates well the political aspect of handedness: Left-wingers are always accuse d of \"condoning\" crime. As so mebody says, \"A mugger just hit a little old lady over the hea d,\" the Left begins rambling a bout economics, social factors, class structure — a veritable monster matri x, an ndimensional explosion, in which the mugger, the old woman and the attack have practically disappeare d. And although the Left may indeed see these relationships, and proposes solutions, it will have trouble explaining and justifying these solutions in simp le language. Their solutions are matrix operators, not readily amenable to a logical — i.e. : syllogistic — exposition. On the other hand, the Right promptly sets out to waste the mugger, because this is the Right Thing, and besides, they must be vigilant, for there will assuredly be more muggers. Now, it is interesting to place this dichotomy in an evolutionary perspective. Presumably Mother Nature did not raise a fool, and so ther e must be a reason for it. Jaynes suggests that putting the reins in the right hand allows faster response time. Because of incessant warfare and exposure to novel situations, and because of the role of language, there was considerable selective pressure in favor of the tactical \"right\". Yet at an earlier time, it's possibl e that the human who simply looked at the terrain, grunted, and led the group to a position with a safer va ntage point might do just as well — or even better — than the one who relied on dexterity to fend off the lion th at lay waiting in the shrubbery. Were you to ask the seer , the human who appeared to foresee the danger, just why he or she decided to avoid the first approach, you'd pr obably get either a lot of mumbo-jumbo, or nothing at all! Mysterious busine ss, that, but nothing more than the ordinary function of the pattern-seeking nonverbal mind.

The sorcerer is sinister, double-dealing, mutters strange things and will evade the swordsman through divination — reading patterns in seemi ngly random signs — or will try to put him in a disadvantaged position through use of hypnotic practices (dividing the swordsman's mind against itself), misdirection (the swordsman can't do more than one thing at a time), and other forms of deception. (How underhanded! Any occultist will tell you that only scum practice the Left-Hand Path, heh heh heh...) The swordsman — on the other hand — is dexter ous and forthright to the point of single- mindedness. He is contemptuous and, incidentally, terrified of his foe. Only by hardening his mind against the distracting wiles and stratagems of the sorcerer can he hope to prevail. (This is why followers of Ayn Rand always go about chanting \"A=A!\") The political Right is contemptuous of the Left . It dreads the Left as the source of unwieldy (n-dimensional, spatio-temporal) doctrines unthi nkable to right-minded folk, but nevertheless capable of luring them to seductive, unnatural mi schief (through addressing arguments to the \"silent hemisphere\", which is th ere even if it does not speak). Meanwhile the Left despises the Right for being narrow-minded (focused on noun and verb, stripped of context), for not being progressive (\"progressive\" = focussed on transformation of context), and being without \"vision\". I do not mean to say that a person designated as \"Left\" or \"Right\" uses exclusively the capabilities of one hemisphere; that would be as absurd as cutting off one hand. Rather, these labels indicated the preferred and consciously acknowledged mode of co gnition in the person. As said before, it is the verbal mind that is regarded by society as th e person's public identity. The mirror mind stands in relationship, then, as a silent complement, a private shadow. It is this private shadow the sorcerer tries to address or persuade. In fear of the consequence, the swordsman will deny its presence, try to silence it. If what offends the right-minded cannot be within, it must be without. It is no accident that the most purely Satanic regime in modern political history launched its rise to power through being the VOICE of right thinking people, who saw debased intellectual doctrines, debauchery, coward ice, treachery and alien so rceries everywhere except in their own heads.

Gordon Wasson R. Gordon Wasson was one of the pioneers of the field of ethnopsychopharmacology -- a mouthful of a word, roughly \"s tudy of the relationship betwee n mind-altering plant drugs and preindustrial cultures.\" He is best known for his study of the hallu cinogenic mushroom cult in Mexico, which had been so thoroughly suppressed that many anth ropologists had began to question Spanish missionary reports of a \"diabolical fungus\" used in pagan ritual. (A small army of hippies descended on Mexico after this work was publis hed, to Wasson's regret.) Before that, he had studied use of the Fly Agaric mushroom by Siberi an shamans. On the basis of various clues, he suggested that this mushroom was the real -world source of the di vine \"Soma\" elixir mentioned in a few of the hymns of the Rg Veda. Later, he made the controversial suggestion th at the neophytes at the Rites of Eleusis in ancient Greece were given a weak infusion prep ared from ergot-infecte d barley; not enough to poison, but enough to lend a mild hallucinatory effect to the theat rical experience.

He, of Swiss origin, married a woman born in Russia. One day, walking in a park, he was shocked to find that while he regarded the wild \"toadstools\" with indifference and mistrust, his wife hailed them as old friends , calling each species by a folk name and even going so far as to gather some for the table. The depth of the difference in their attitudes seem ed so bizarre to him that he began to look into myths, folk tales, and words used by each culture, trying to understand the reason for it. He eventually concluded that the roots of such a radical difference must lie in some type of religious taboo. This led him to investigate th e evidence for use of mushrooms in religious cults. The \"heart\" of his thesis, as it relates to our perspective on conventional religion, is this: plant agents that disrupt conscious ness were originally used as a means to induce unusual experiences in hunter-gatherer cu ltures. \"Vision Quest\" ordeals, whether chemical or physical, are characteristic of these cu ltures. When drug-induced \"visi on\" became inconvenient in more orderly civilizations, the use of plant drugs to demonstrate a nd justify religion was abandoned, but much of the conceptual scaffoldin g remained, now supported by \"faith\". This is particularly striking in the case of the symbolic cannibalism theme in Christianity. It is easier to make sense of the thing, particularly th e Catholic forms, when you realize that tribal witch doctors have been consuming plants they call \"the flesh of the gods,\" and experiencing marked changes in consciousness interpreted as \"communion with spirits, \" since the dawn of humanity. This, too, is how \"faith\" came to be regarded as superior to reason in R.H.P. religions: the suspension of intellectual functioning goes ha nd-in-hand with drug-facilitated mystical experience. Thus mystics asse rted that \"higher consciousne ss\" requires abandonment of reason, and still do, even if they denounce drugs originally used for that same purpose.

If we are truly honest with ourselves, we mu st rein in those past, adolescent fantasies regarding man's capability to \"better himself.\" Su ch teachings, I am sure, we all have suffered, preached to us from pulpits and political platforms, and in schools and kitchens. I will assume here that the term \"better hims elf\" refers only to a myriad of technological developments. I grant that a few developments are very positive, considering the most dramatic and most recent: telephone, television, camera, and certain late medical advances. To this add Orwellian-type robots, who are cu rrently amassed in loci like Silicon Valley; good things with micro-chips — even though th is is more improvement than creation. While this is all commendable, man should be much farther ahead on the path of futuristic idealism as envisioned by his sci-fi demonstr ations in movies, books, and even dreams. After all, he really thinks he's quite something! Surely, as man has developed and invented, he ha s either consciously or inherently neglected many humanistic qualities. As Michelangelo painted or ch ipped away at marble, he demonstrated an idea. One can actually feel the Pieta. As B eethoven composed, he demonstrated beauty, pain, and conquest. This ho lds true also for da Vinci, Mozart, Plato, and all of the other innumerable exceptions to the drab masses of humanity in the times past and late present, right up to H itler. And Anton LaVey, too, had an important message for mankind; and that message echoes loudly as a re sult of LaVey's existence alone. Add to these the Elect, and you are at the top of the family tree.

Naturally all that man has accomplished, both technologically and humanisti cally, is now in the past. And it seems to me that, in those times of his greater glory, he pursued more individual efforts. This was due largely to the lack of media, communications, and mass-manipulation by organized attempt. [What we proudly acclaim as frontiers have, in many cases, done much harm.] In this absence of a Madison Avenue society, there were personalized effort s in science, medicine, and culture — an apparently self-oriented quest for self-improvement and perfection. Presently, on the other hand, man is divided into warring factions, politic al parties, religions, and societal classifications. Pe rsonalized self-existence is frow ned upon. One must be \"for\" or \"against\", never uninvolved or decidedly neutral — for that would denote intellect. The \"great sin\" returneth! The media and the call to vague, Jingoistic bann ers have usurped man's memory, his inherent path of glory. His ignorance and cruelty are awards of merit. Ideas are ex pected to be valued and rated en masse. The power inherent in millions of brains is directed to one big end, because \"it was on the news.\" In all of these puerile brai ns is not enough substance to compose a good nursery rhyme, much less an opus. The future? Well, if this work seems pessimistic now.... [You see, I had to say \"pessimistic\". By now the reader will have thought it. We have been trained to think only in the optimistic, pessimistic, or objective frames of mind in order to relegate thought. If possible we should try to think in none of the three, thence will emerge the creative intellect.] Realistically man's future lies in the hands of madmen. A great thinker (?) once wrote: \"If all the leaders of men in the world went crazy for 24 hours, it would make no difference. Humanity has released its hold on itself; man has expired to the lash of unidirection and goal. In some cases, hundreds of millions of lives are th reatened in order to force an idea on a few thousand people of a lesser race in some obscure corner of the world. This contradicts sane logic. Sadly, it is symptomatic of a global de ath-march in the physical sense as well. Masses of humans are entrenched in a few groups of masses of humans. These masses plot against other masses for political, religious , or societal classification. In the psychological and personal senses, a very few as yet have hopes for a Hari Seldon-type of escape.

Set / HarWer – The Discussion Continues The term \"selfintegration\" is one of those co mmonly used terms that has been around a while in mental health literature. Use of the term \"i ntegration\" to refer to the process by which self coordinates its functions and realities in an evolutionary manner with the goal of differentiation (freedom from others while in harmony with them) dates back to Milton H. Erickson (19011980), whose theories and practice built upon the work of Freud, with much original work of his own, especially in th e area of hypnosis. \"Self\" has been added to \"integration\" by various writers drawing fr om the bulkier \"integration of self.\" I use the concept of \"selfintegration\" as a possible simile for approaching Understanding of the relationship between Set and HarWer. That is: Set relates to HarWer as the divergent polarities within Self resolve in identity/personality as di fferentiation or integration. Upon following this discussion within my own mind, I find Set and HarWer inseparable, just as the components of personality are inseparable, no matter how divergent they may seem. (A question comes to mind here ... what does pers onality have to do with essence? Personality is a fluid reality of self. I think it flows or is prompted triggered by essence as consciousness responds to the black flame.) (1) This paper will limit itself to just a discussion of the challenges of personality, the dualities or polarities, the paradoxes and iron ies, the environment and nature vs. nurture questions all being lumped together for now. It is the lifelong task of Self to achieve Dynamic Balance of these disparities in order to harness and focus their ener gy toward Xeper, instead of disintegrating from failure to achieve such mastery. This discussion attempts to refine the concep t of Self-integration from a Setian viewpoint. First, however, some terms need to be explained towards a working definition. Classification: V2 - 159.2I - 1 Author: Ruth Nielsen III° Date: June 23, XXVIII HTML Revision: Sept. 9, 1998 CE Subject:  Self-Integration  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"I understand self as a composite of potential and act ualized reality, with selfconsciousness (intelligence) and free will as the main charac teristics that distingui sh it from every other aspect of the human being. Integration was in the past used in a general way to mean the unification of parts into a whole. Since the 60's civil rights movement it has b ecome synonymous with the subject of racial integration. I like that usage better, even for this discussion. In selfintegr ation the elements of self are not so unified that they cease to exist as separate aspects, but rather they can still be identified as components, or factors, of the ove rall state of self at any given time. As in a harmonious society there are individuals with separate but common purposes, so there are aspects of self which are distinct but integral to the existence of self. Some examples are in the areas of cognitiv e skills: memory, abstraction, language, and judgement to name a few. These are aspects of in telligence which can be tested separately and even addressed separately in treatment, if in the judgment of a prof essional there is the potential for development (as in a brain injured child) or rehabilitation (as in cerebral vascular accident (2) or stroke (3) ). As we consider the subject of SelfIntegration , this capitalization indi cates a special Setian Understanding of the term. In this case I believe the additional considerati ons that we give to the process of Xeper and its paramount importan ce in our lives as Seti ans gives not just an additional layer of meaning, but an infusion of meaning that permeates the Setian Self in contrast to the average Jane and John Doe, no matter to what extent they pursue and realize aristos . There is some discussion in the work of Dane Rudhyar, revered for his philosophical approach to the questions and i ssues of astrology, that comes close to being an exception to that generalization. That exception is found in his use of the term \"transpersonal,\" not only in regard to his approach to astrology but to philo sophy in general. His thin king is that it is not enough to seek or strive for the most noble expr ession of man, but that we are capable of a transpersonal dimension based on the recognition and development of a \"divine seed\" within us. SelfIntegration , as a specifically Setian life proces s and the fluid, evolutionary product of Xeper, includes all of those processes within the normal realm of personality development, plus those aspects discovered within the spiritual odyssey of the Setian. The latter takes its raison d'être from the normal and mundane if it ha s any meaning at all. For example, we often speak and hear of the development of will pow er in the growing child. The Setian sees Will (4) in the magickal sense of a dimension of f unction that has cosmic repercussions when specifically focused in G.B.M. Otherwise it is just will. It is unlikely, from a developmental sense, that one can skip the purely human stages of development and shoot for the Setian use and understanding. Skipping developmental stages in the purely human skills lead s to developmental deficiencies. This may happen from failures in the organism (genetic or birth defects, or birth trauma, for example), or from emotional trauma such as early childhood abuse. Such losses impair functioning, and the individual suffers throughout life unless th ere is intervention, an inte rvention that often involves treatment over an extended peri od of time. Society now generally accepts some responsibility towards individuals with these deficits, with a goal to integration to the greatest extent possible."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Logically then, it seems appropriate to look at the process of personality development as it occurs (or should occur) normally, in order to see the stepping off point for the Setian, wherein his Will goes beyond the profane and the natural, to the leap beyond into the unnatural. It also seems logical that this in formation would be useful to the Setian in developing an understanding of his own personal ity and its level of ma turation. If there are some areas of personality deficit, they can be addressed before trying to move into using those skills in a Setian sense. For example, trust development being one of the earliest stages of human development, issues of trust may be serious enough that a Setian has problems with taking people at their word in general. In the profane world this causes co mmunication problems in the work place and at home. In the Temple environment this may be ma gnified, as we not only e xpect to be taken at our word, but we extend that courtesy to others. Evidence then of a lack of trust in a Setian is a much greater concern than it would be in the profane realm. A Setian who finds anxiety over considering the word of a nother, and who experiences this frequently with a number of Setians, may have an unresolved developmental stage of trust. These points of discussion are not meant to point fingers at anyone, or to make amateur psychologists out of anyone. However, the level of self awareness a nd deep personal work that characterize the typical Setian opens the door to self help techniques being of real value in those initial years of Xepe r ... and perhaps even later. To provide the foundation for this discussion, I wi ll present here a summary of the history of the use of \"integration\" as a psychological term relevant to personality development. The reference used is the first volume of a two volume set of hardcover texts, The Handbook of Family Psychology and Therapy , edited by Luciano L'Abate, and published by Dorsey Press, 1985. Of special note is Chapter 3: Personality Development in the Family by Clifford H. Swenson, Jr., of the Department of Psychol ogical Sciences, at Purdue University. Swenson begins with a summary equation which sets the theme for the rest of the chapter. It is perhaps an obvious statement, but it bears repeating: R = f(P 1 P 2 ... P n ) E or Relationships = function of (Person 1, Person 2, ... Person n) Environment. This is really an equation that expresses the change which occurs within and to a relationship. The change may be due to the people changing and therefore the relati onship changes, or the environment within which they interact change s, thus making demands upon them to adapt. Personality development is the primary way people change, other than through physical changes. Personality development is a proce ss that continues throughout life. Environmental changes such as cultural development or di sintegration, moving and growing up, all impact upon personality development by faci litating or testing it. Even death does not end the process of change within a family, and that impacts upon personality. Those of us who have lost parents or loved ones know that i ssues related to them remain with us still. The author states: \"Because the patterns of relationships repeat themselves through generations, a family's dynamic balance today is not composed simply of the interaction of the personalities of those now present, but includes members of the family who are no longer present or who have died"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"long ago.\" In psychological terms then, this is a testament to the appropriate focus upon ancestor issues within the ritual and study of Setians. Personality development consists of passage through stages of life characterized, for most people, as periods of stability lasting for six to eight years, and periods of transition lasting for three to five years. Love rela tionships tend to occur during the transition stages, as the \"other\" often is perceived as one who can provide th e stability felt lacking by the one going through transition. When two people who are in love are both in transition and decide to get married, they often have difficulty adjusting to the \"changes\" when the stability (?) that raising children demands becomes the new stage of life. [As another aside, it is easy to pinpoint the transition stag es one can expect, or that one has gone through, by doing a careful (as in professional) astrological chart (something to be explored in another paper). This has nothing to do with \"fate\" or \"predestination.\" In a very simplified example, if I know it is going to storm rather severely, I will not take the kids to the beach. Likewise if my \"astrological weather\" indicates \"stormy\" planetary alignments for Mercury, I will either refrain from writing letters and making important decisions, or I will take extra precautions. A Setian who is aware then of the astr ological climate has anothe r L.B.M. tool to use for refining Self.] The key processes that characteri ze the adult stages of life are differentiation and integration , for which the developmental goal is \"an increased sense of inner freedom.\" The author puts it succinctly: \"The main themes of life center on work and love. When either area presents a problem, the individual faces a challenge to grow. ... On e may avoid, deny, and repress the problem (in effect, fixating at a particular stage of devel opment), or one may develop a more complex and appropriate cognitive structure (i e: differentiate), and thus move on to another, more complex stage. Because the family is the main focus of love, problems in the intimate relationships of family life precipitate fixation or growth.\" He goes on to explain further th e developmental processes: \"Development is a dialectical process produced by the interaction among the biological, psychological, and social factors in a person's lif e. When one factor changes, all of the rest must readjust to reestablish harmony, and from th is interaction emerges the stages of life. The dialectical process is an inter action between the two poles of differentiation and integration (5) . Differentiation emphasizes the autonomy th at one must have to cope with the changing circumstances of life; integration is the process of unificat ion with other people, which is also necessary for a satisfactory life . Development is differentiation and growth in the face of new challenges, and the integration of the growth with the total life structure. We are motivated to develop our yearning for incl usion and our yearning fo r distinctness, twin yearnings that are in constant tension. Each swing represents a swing toward integration or differentiation. Another way to l ook at stages is that differentiation represents the transition from one stage to another, and the establishmen t of a new stage represents integration at a new and more complex level of development. Development toward complexity gives one greater internal control over behavior, providing greater flexibility and therefore greater choice in determining how life will go. (6) \"... Stages of personality development can be described in terms of ego functioning. The ego is not a thing, but the organization of the totality of one's personality. It organizes our perceptions of our experience, and our attempts to cope with the prob lems presented by that"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"experience. Personality develops through alterna ting periods of differen tiation and integration. ... The more differentiated and integrated our personalities are, the more we can accommodate to others, the more accurately we can perceive others, and the more appropriately we can react to others.\" This entire last paragraph poi nts up the importance of the Setian taking environment and the \"real world\" of interactions w ith others very seriously. This is what Xepering is all about, HOW the Setian does these things: \"organiz ation,\" \"coping,\" \"differentiation,\" and \"integration.\" This means that everything about everyday life is relevant to Xeper. There's no such thing as \"my Temple behavior\" and \"my at home behavior\" in terms of the way we look at ourselves, others, and our environment, if we are truly working at Selfintegration as a Setian. I don't mean of course that at home one may belch and at the Temple banquet we don't. I'm talking about the deep down basics . Masks or \"postures\" are part of the developmental stage in this proce ss. It is no indictment of anyone if those things are part of a Setian's life. It simply means there is more left for the process of Xeper. A number of prominent figures in the world of psychiatry have outlined what they believe to be the stages of development. Milton Erikson's is the best known (since 1950), and it basically extends the Freudian stages of development. Erikson's theory however states that a person must accomplish the developmental tasks of each stage before he can go on to the next stage. Failure to do so retards integration, or worse, sets the stage for any number of problems or even psychopathology. The issues of the various tasks may remain as lifelong challenges to be met time and again, but the major work of resolu tion needs to be done at the appropriate time in life. In brief, the Eriksonian stages of personality development and the tasks associated with them are as follows: Stage I Oral sensory: trust ve rsus mistrust (learning to trust other people). Stage II Muscularanal: autonomy versus shame or doubt (the period in which the child learns selfcontrol). Stage III -- Locomotorgenital: initiative versus gu ilt (Erikson's equivalent to the oedipal stage). Stage IV -- Latency: Industry versus inferiority (t he school age, during which a child learns many new skills and is exposed to comparing the performances of self and peers). Stage V -- Puberty and adolescence: id entity versus role confus ion (developing a clear sense of personal identity, and a stable sense of self as an individu al apart from the family). Stage VI -- Young adulthood: intimacy versus isolat ion. (The previous stage, in which the person develops a stable sense of self, must be completed succe ssfully before one can form an intimate relationship with another person). Stage VII -- Adulthood, generativity versus stagna tion and self-absorption (producing and assuming the responsibility for help ing younger persons to develop)."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Stage VIII -- Maturity: ego integrity versus de spair (old age, in which one who has successfully weathered life can look back and see life as having value and significance). No one can escape their family or the effects of their family history. For the Setian it is a fertile starting point for L.B.M. when first em barking upon the dark path. Who hasn't had to finally explain to Mom that the pentagram me dallion was truly a lifelong commitment and not a matter open for negotiation. \"This is who I am, love me like this or I'm gone...\" But getting the family to accept us, provided the family has been supportive all along, isn't as hard as getting society to just be tolera nt enough so we can go about our business of Xepering, and quite incidentally, contributing significantly to the evolutionary current of this planet though it be behind the scenes. One way that suggests itself strongly is that the Setian use the pers onality developmental stages as a rough guideline for the L.B.M. and G.B.M. work that he wishes to accomplish on a grander scale. To do that, I've come up w ith some key words and a few questions to correspond to each of the Eriksonian stages. I w ould also suggest that if any readers take offense at the choice of words or concepts in those stages, please provide feedback and suggestions as they relate to your life choices, or lifestyle. I o ffer them here as a starting point for discussion. Some of the quest ions may be very startling. D on't let any of them become a source of anxiety. If they are ... talk to someone! The questions are meant to elicit a wide range of responses for personal explor ation of feelings and impressions. Stage I : Trust versus mistrust. Those who attended Conclave last year had the opportunity to work with Magister Robinson to explore this developmental aspect in Setian terms. This is exactly what I mean by taking the ordina ry tasks and Xepering with them. Questions for further exploration of trust in L.B.M. or G.B.M.: 1. Is there anyone in my life that I am truly afraid of, and if so why? Can I discover the source of this fear? 2. Is there anyone in my immediate life situati on with whom I have cl ose contact that, if given the opportunity to do so with out getting caught, would kill me? 3. Is there anyone in my immediate life situa tion whom I could trust to seal me in a coffin for a specified period of time and then open it to release me? 4. Can I prove to myself that there is some one in my life situation who trusts me? 5. Can I convince someone who is a stranger to me that I am totally trustworthy on the first encounter? Take this to a shopping ma ll and find out. If it works then analyze what L.B.M. techniques you used (body language, dress, etc.), and share. 6. Do I automatically suspect people of being out \"to get me,\" even when they may have indeed been kind to me in the past? Stage II : \"Yes I can!\" is the Key concept here. Setia ns relive some of the sense of this stage when first setting out to let the world know they can function capab ly in spite of criticism and hostility from the masses. The first step toward s guilt is letting doubt set in. This doubt for a Setian is the nagging question \"Do I really have what it takes to be a Setian?\" This is a personal and interior cycle of achievement (recognition within the Temple) and doubt (the profane has no tolerance for the gleam in your eye, assuming you are up to something when you didn't even get that far ... yet!)."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Questions that may be helpful for Setian explor ation of this stage: 1. How do I really feel about myself as a Setian when I am all alone and reflecting up on my struggles and achievements? The emphasis here is on feelings in a broad sense; issues of identity come up later. 2. Do I have any friends in the Temple who praise me or provide \"warm fuzzies\" for no reason at all? 3. Is there anyone in my life situ ation who by their words or gestures, or maybe lack of them, make me feel like I'm a loser? 4. Do I admit to anyone that I need them just for \"moral support,\" or do I have to have a \"good excuse\" to get the attention of someone I admire? 5. Am I comfortable sharing my feelings with those in my life s ituation, or do I feel like I am imposing upon them ... or do they treat me like I am a pain? 6. Can I within ritual draw up from the depths of my Self str ong feelings of Selfwo rth and security? Stage III : Initiative with res ponsibility. This is th e stage that perhaps gets bantered about most by amateur psychologists. The issues of guilt from unresolved or poorly resolved tasks within this stage may set the groundwork for a r eal festering of soul. Since the effect of guilt is to \"carry a monkey on my back,\" because some one else has made me believe I have to take responsibility for a wrong determin ed by their value system, this can be extremely crippling. The core issue seems to be the word \"responsib ility.\" I have learned that no matter how much someone else believes I am at fault for somethi ng, if I truly did not set out to hurt them, or did in fact act in a manner that to me was responsib le, I will refuse to be \"dumped upon\" or to be made to feel guilty. The problem is theirs, period. Issues of guilt can provide some real grist for th e millwork of rituals designed to \"readjust the past.\" A useful technique is to relive a moment in the past wherein guilt was a big issue. Leave the situation as it happened, but change what you internalized , and now alter the past by putting into the memories of that moment, from here on in, the new material ... the Setian guilt-free beliefs you have now. This is a techni que that is best accomplished by using a self- hypnosis or auto-suggestion technique over a short period of time - like daily for a week -- to supplement the ritual work if the original probl em is complex or highly volatile. It might be really helpful to consider a counseling session with a professi onal also, to help focus the issues before doing the ritual, so they are clearly understood. Questions: 1. Is there a \"monkey\" on my back? 2. Is there anything about my dist ant or recent past that I am sincerely struggling with, that has the burden of guilt about it? What would I like to change about that memory, if I was truly in the wrong? In this case doing a ritual to \"r ight the deed\" may in effect be a very powerful tool in exorcising guilt for something we did. Who says we have to carry it to our grave? 3. Is there anything likewise about my past for which I am carrying a burden of guilt, which I am doing so as a victim or unwitting subject? This too can be ritually exorcised, or relived as descri bed in the Stage II comments. 4. When I drive the guilt from my being, it is important to replace it with confidence, pride and assertion. What task s can I imagine immediately after the ritual exorcism that could have occurred at that past mome nt, which would have left me with feelings of pride now? By now it should be obvious how the Aeonic Fo rmula is used in these exercises. We can change the past by going back and magick ally altering the reality as we Will . The past lives in"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"our memories, and we carry the effects of that ba ggage with us at all ti mes. It is hard enough carrying around extra pounds of \"m iddle age spread,\" much less a monkey that won't sit still or get off. We can instead take the initiative, as the task of this stage requires, and once and for all learn how to masterfu lly Xeper from one's guilt. Stage IV : Selfesteem is the key word here. The co mmon term \"low self-esteem\" is often used by professionals in mental health toward t hose who exhibit deviant behavior as a coping mechanism in response to a society in which they are treated as inferior. The emphasis at this stage is upon concrete accomplishment, \"what do I have to show in terms of mastery of basic skil ls?\" This question is coupled with, \"how do I compare with everyone else in my peer group?\" Unfortunately we can't escape the comparison of ourselves to others. We live in a society that demands accountability once we enter the \"age of reason.\" It is interesting to note that th is begins in earnest when a child is 7, at which point they are usually in second grade. Everything about this period is Saturnian ... accountability, self- discipline, separation from the nurturing parent (gratification is delayed not denied), until we get home from school and can tell about how hard it was. The rewards of hard work are also there, and that is a side of Saturn that few appreciate or understand. At this time in a person's life, Saturn is ma king its first 90 degree angl e (as it transits through a person's astrological birth chart) to the place it was when the person was born. The 90 degree angle is one of inner cha llenge as the individua l has to wrestle with inner realities and realign them with the demands of the outer wo rld, or in some other way manipulate them to resolve the issues of this stage. For the Setian, ritual work that relives memories of this period to complete or rework tasks would be nefit from using the Saturnian energy. Selfesteem can be interchanged with the phrase \"self- value.\" With that in mind, the following questions suggest themselves: 1. What task of my daily life, when I do it well, gives me the most sense of \"Damn, I'm Good!\"? 2. How many tim es today did I try to get someone else to notice me, give me a compliment, or in general ta ke their time or attention for myself, when it probably wouldn't have been given to me otherw ise? How does that make me feel? Why were those people, or that person, so important to my feeling of selfworth? 3. What statements of praise would I like to hear from the 10 people I like the most, respect the most, or know the best? 4.

[Shu:] Name a virtue, and someone will call it sin. Describe a sin, and someone will see a virtue. How then do we rate beha vior good or evil, virtue or sin? [Tefnut:] Two measures define a sin, or a vir tue — two measures that seek the why and what of any sin or virtue. As Shuti is both the visible Shu and the hidden Tefnut, so is one measure seen and visible, and the other measure is hidden, unseen. [Shu:] Behaviors are seen, as are their results. What is the behavior? Is it noble, enlightened, the act of a god being born? Or is it low, blindly reactive, the act of an animal? What are the results? Are you trul y better off? Is the Aeon, the Temple, and humanity improved? Or did the behavior bring forth negative results, harm and decay? Measure and weigh the behavior and the result, and sin or virtue will be seen. [Tefnut:] Motives are unseen, internal, as are Initiation and Xeper. Along with the visible results, we must examine the unseen motivations - Why were this action and method chosen? Were the motives noble, g odly, or were they petty and self- serving? [Shu:] Now is the time to shine the light of Truth upon your plans, your motives, your paths of action.

Placed upon the altar: The Collected Dialogues of Plato , Hamilton & Cairns (Ed.), Princeton University Press, 1961 CE.] The Sphinx: I think it essential to pr eface any discussion of a si ngle Platonic dialogue with two major qualifications. The firs t is that, to be treated with out distortion, Plato's philosophy must be appreciated in its entirety. Empha sis upon any single dialogue or group of dialogues carries with it a certain unfairness to the author. The Chimaera: Yet our span of materia lization is limited, and we cannot hope to treat the entire range of Plato's thought in the time available to us. The Sphinx: True, and so let us focus first upon The Sophist , which illustrates many of the points most important to this investigation. The Chimaera: But what is your second qualification? The Sphinx: There is the problem of unde rstanding what Plato \"really meant.\" This is an issue against which I am powerless to defend myself. I am of Khem and not of Hellas; I am bilingual only in English and hence must depe nd upon my understanding of Plato as he is translated into the English language. The dialogues center much of their discussions around terms whose final definitions are elusive at best, even in conversations carried out at intellectual planes below that of Plato. Then, too, there is al ways the spectre of imprecise translation from the Greek to the English. A nd Plato himself could not anticipate this. The Chimaera: Your qualifications are en tirely acceptable. Proceed ... The Sphinx: The initial question raised by The Sophist is its raison d'être . Why should Plato have felt it necessary to include such a dialogue as this in hi s philosophy at all? Was it truly because the included lines of argument required exposure? Or did Plato intend the document rather as a gauntlet of sorts to be flung before the Sophists themselves? Classification: V2 - 184.RI - 1 Author: Michael A.

Grasping it with a forepaw, he turns to page #958. Yes, here it is: The argument is hung on the figure of the Sophist qui te arbitrarily. No real picture is given of the men who were the professional instructors of Greece for many years. All Plato does is ascribe to them every notion he disapproves. He detested the whole band of Sophists. To him they were shallow minded, pretentious, superficia l, mercenary — they were really doing what Socrates was charged with, co rrupting the minds of the young. And this appears to be reinforced by the dialogu e's concluding statement, which seems to be little more than an outright vilification of Sophistry. He turns to page #1016 and quotes: The art of contradiction making, descended from an insincere kind of conceited mimicry, of the semblance making breed, derive from im age making, distinguished as a portion, not divine but human, of production, th at presents a shadowy play of words — such are the blood and lineage which can, with perfect truth, be assigned to the authentic Sophist. The Sphinx: Obviously that is not an obj ective philosophical statement. It is a deliberate insult reached through a dialectical pr ocess which, in retrospect, se ems a transparent parody of Plato's more serious argumentative style. In most of the Platonic dialogues one feels that Socrates is not \"managing\" the conversation towa rds an end that he has conceptualized before hand. But every twis t and turn of The Sophist is designed only to channel the conversation into providing a part of that final statement. The Chimaera: But how would you have Plato compose such a definition, save by a summary of the component arguments preceding it? The Sphinx: I quarrel not with the final assembly pro cess, but rather with the fashion in which the components themselves were forged. For, you see, there are many ways along which each of those component arguments could have proc eeded. Each, however, co nsistently follows a path derogatory to the Sophists. If the Sophists were in fact personifications of all that is erroneous and destructive in teaching, all possi ble paths would lead to the same conclusion, i.e.: one derogatory to the Sophists. Bu t this is not the case at all. See — He takes the book from the Chimaera and turns to page #973: STRANGER: They cross-examine a man's words, wh en he thinks that he is saying something and is really saying nothing, and easily convict h im of inconsistencies in his opinions; these they then collect by the dialec tic process, and, placing them si de by side, show that they contradict one another about the same things, in relation to the same things, and in the same respect. He, seeing this, is angr y with himself, and grows gentle towards others, and thus is entirely delivered from greater prejudices and harsh notions, in a way which is most amusing to the hearer, and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation. For as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from taking food until the internal obstacles ha ve been removed, so the purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no benefit from th e application of knowledge until he is refuted, and from refutation learns modesty; he must be purged of his prejudices first and made to think that he knows only what he knows, and no more. THEAETETUS: That is certainly the best and wisest state of mind."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"STRANGER: For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we must admit that refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications, and he who has not been refute d, though he be the Great King himself, is in an awful state of impurity; he is uninstructed and deform ed in those things in which he who would be truly blesse d ought to be fairest and purest. THEAETETUS: Very true. STRANGER: Well, what name shall we give to th e practitioners of this art? For my part I shrink from calling them Sophists. THEAETETUS: Why so? STRANGER: For fear of ascribi ng to them too high a function. THEAETETUS: And yet your description has some resemblance to that type (the Sophist). STRANGER: So has the dog to the wolf — the fiercest of animals to the tamest. But a cautious man should above all be on his guard agai nst resemblances; they are a very slippery sort of thing. Now let me rewrite the latter part of the dial ogue. In doing so I shall move to eliminate the stranger's instinctive or preconceived no tion of what Sophists actually are. The Sphinx gestures at the page, and the wording changes: STRANGER: Well, what name shall we give to the practitioners of this art? THEAETETUS: The characteristics you have enumerated are those the Sophists use to describe themselves. STRANGER: But I fear this ascrib es too high a function to them. THEAETETUS: To say that individual Sophists may not achieve the standards they have set for themselves does not disprove the nobility of their goal, nor their right to claim it as a standard and hence an identifying ch aracteristic of their profession. STRANGER: I cannot find fault with that. But le t us examine the Sophist from some other vantage-points ... The wording reverts to normal, and the Sphinx closes the book. I do not say that the dialogue should have proceeded in a diffe rent direction. I merely demons trate that it would have been possible. This fact — that it is possible — testifies to the loos eness of Plato's logic in this instance. Rather than refining the definition of the Sophist by the ca reful elimination of inconsistent characteristics, Plato simply ignores implicat ions which do not support his preconceived notions. The Chimaera: I'm beginning to see what you mean. The Sphinx: There are other examples which I could take from the text. But I think this demonstration sufficient proof of the principle in volved. The entire dialog ue is not an attempt"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"to understand what a Sophist is. It is an attempt to denigrate Sophists. As such it is of no value as an exercise in logic or in the true process of reduction. The Chimaera: But now we are back where we starte d, enriched only by an irony of Socratic logic: We know what The Sophist is not , but we don't know what it is . So we must consider why Plato felt it necessary to attack the Sophists at all. Why did he not feel it possible merely to coexist with them in friendly competition for men's minds? The Sphinx: Here we must depart from the dialogue as a universe in itself. We must try to place it in context amidst a larg er and more complex universe. The reason for doing this is that, viewed in isolation, The Sophist is logically invalid; this we have just proven. Seen against a larger background, however, it may i ndeed be significant. We attempt, like Archimedes, to move a world. For a place to stand we have the existence of The Sophist ; for a lever we have its bias. The world need move only a little, and we who push against the lever may count ourselves satisfied. The Chimaera: I follow you, but beware of uns ubstantiated speculation ... The Sphinx: The proponent of a viewpoint who feels secure in his position will not find it necessary to attack the mere existence of opponents. He may poi nt out the fallacies in their arguments in an effort to hasten their understand ing of his \"correct inte rpretation.\" But he will not see their \"incorrect\" views as a threat to the truth of his own. An attack against the very existence of competition is mounted when one is uncertain of the invulnerability of one's own position. Permitted to exist, competition might pose a mortal challenge. Hence it must be destroyed without delay. Such a preemptory stri ke is justified by the ra tionalization that, while one has glimpsed an ultimate truth, more time is needed to refine the ideas to a form which may be understood by those of lesser intellectual acumen. The Chimaera: You are suggesting, then, that Plato ma y not have felt secure in his philosophy — that he feared the axioms upon which he based his logic to be false? The Sphinx: Let us not say that he feared them to be false. It is enough to say that he may not have been completely certain of their truth. Had he been, he would have ignored the Sophists. The Chimaera: Why should Plato have attacked the Sophists in particular? Was it simply because they were his only Athenian compe tition? That would make his motives rather materialistic. The Sphinx: Here we should bear in mind that we have no precise catalogue of individuals whom Plato considered Sophists. At various times he took issue with th e ideas of Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno, and Protagoras, to name but a few theorists. Whether he considered the Sophists as comprising only spec ific individuals or whether he considered Sophism more broadly to be composed of all challengers to his own philosophy is an issue we cannot decide. If we are to look through Plato's eyes via The Sophist , we can establish on ly that the Sophists were guilty of teaching according to methods too close to those of Plato himself. The Chimaera: You mean, I take it, by the process of cross-examination described by the stranger in the passage we considered earlier?"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Sphinx: Precisely. I ask you to consider both th e praise that the stranger accords the system itself and his unsubstantiated reluctance to credit that system to the Sophists. History contains many examples pointing to the fact that the most dangerous threats are those akin to the favored philosophy in all ways save one — whic h is considered to be crucial. Wars have been fought simply because men were unable to agree upon one name for the same god, or, later, because they could not agree upon the same meanings for words such as \"freedom,\" \"democracy,\" and \"equality.\" The Chimaera: Only two wars that I recall strike me as having made any sense: the Trojan War, which was fought for sex, and the Cartha ginian Wars, which were fought for money. The Sphinx: Very funny. But to return to the issue at hand, we ha ve the evidence of that passage in The Sophist to substantiate this point. Plat o regarded the process of teaching through cross-examination to be a standard of excellence in itself. It s use to teach anything other than pure philosophy, accordingly, would have been intolerable to him. Hence his extraordinary anger at the Sophists. The Chimaera: But we do know more about the Sophists than that. Even if we limit our scope to the school of Protagoras, we know that S ophistic thinking disavowed absolute knowledge. Despairing of attaining such knowle dge, they regarded even its pur suit as worthless. So they taught a sort of relativistic pragmatism as the only sound basis for human affairs. Hence Protagoras' famous statement that man is the measure of all things. The Sphinx: That is right. And we know that Plato was firmly opposed to this view. Perhaps our most convincing evidence of this is the in scription above the entr ance to his Academy: Let no one ignorant of mathematics enter here. The Chimaera: I thought it was \"geometry.\" The Sphinx: Unfortunately for purists it has been reco rded both ways. But either serves to illustrate the point. Plato saw in mathematics unshakable evidence that there was an absolute standard for the Universe. And where one such st andard existed, it was lo gical to assume that there were others. Today humans regard mathema tics principally as an applied science, but in Plato's time it was considered by the Pythagoreans to be \"pure,\" having nothing to do with the gross and imperfect everyday world. The Chimaera: I presume that Plato would have been somewhat upset to learn of the Theory of Relativity, which is inconsistent with the notion that mathematics adhere to a fixed standard. But do I understand you to sa y that Plato was a Pythagorean? The Sphinx: Not in the sense that he had any connec tions with one of the Pythagorean schools as such. He was born in Athens in 427 BCE, and he was a discip le of Socrates from 409 to 399. Following Socrates' execution in that year, Plato traveled abroad, absorbing Pythagorean doctrines in many of the Greek ci ties located in Italy and Africa. It was not until 387 that he returned to Athens to found his Academy. The Chimaera: That is interesting, but it does not cons titute evidence that Plato endorsed the views of the Pythagoreans."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Sphinx: No, and for that one must turn to the Timaeus , wherein Plato presents his concept of the Universe. Here he describes the five possible regular solids — that is, those with equivalent faces and with all lines and angles equal. Four of those represented the four elements, he said, while the dodecahedron represented the Universe as a whole. He also postulated that the various stellar / planetary bod ies move in exact circles (the perfect curve) along with the crystalline spheres (the perfect solid) holding them in place. All of these theories were originally Pythagorean, as one ma y see from the writings of Philolaus and other avowed Pythagoreans. But we wander too far afie ld. Let us return to Plato's conviction that the Universe was based upon absolu te, not relative standards. The Chimaera: I presume that the Sophist s did not consider mathema tics as an invalidation of their relativism. The Sphinx: Whether the issue centered around mathem atics or not is something we cannot know. We do know that the Sophists considered whatever evidence Plato offered insufficient to dislodge them from their pos ition. From their point of view , the Sophists were champions of logic. They based their arguments upon what they understood to be \"obvious\" realities. And they drew \"common sense\" conclusions. Wh at so antagonized Plato was not that they held different views than his concerning the prim al forces of the Universe. Rather it was the intolerable insult — in Plato's eyes — that they we re not interested in that topic as a field for rational inquiry. Plato must have felt somewhat akin to Noah building his Ark in the midst of an ignorant and unconcerned society. The Chimaera: The Noah legend is not in our myth-cycle, if you please. The Sphinx: My apologies. The Chimaera: And so Plato wished to identify the primal forces of the Universe. This resulted in his famous Theory of the Forms, if I am correct. But I se nse a weak point here. Plato was a finite being, and ye t he desired to comprehend Universal absolutes. As perfect standards they would necessarily be infinite, since any measur e of perfection must extend in all dimensions without limitati on. It would be possible for a fi nite entity like Plato to comprehend the infinite without di stortion only if the infinite re veals aspects of itself to and through the finite. But the finite must have faith or trust that the aspects are undistorted in their presentation. The Sphinx: Precisely, and now we are getting to the crux ansata of the matter. For, you see, assumptions based upon faith or trust are logica lly indefensible, otherwise there would be no need to base them upon faith or trust to begi n with. Plato, being a ma n of no mean intellect, was certainly aware of this. He feared that an intelligent Sophist might see it as well and proceed to attack the foundati ons of his entire philosophy as illogical. And so, in the dialogues, he constructed a very elaborate defe nse of his concepts a ccording, apparently, to the most rigorous standards of the cro ss-examination system of the Sophists. The Chimaera: Statements like that are liable to ge t you into a great deal of trouble, I hope you know. The Sphinx: Only with those who underestimate Plato a nd interpret this as a slur against him. Quite the contrary, it is all the more indicative of his brilliance. The entire process of \"logical reasoning\" is ultimately circular. What humans l oosely term \"cause and effect\" relationships"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"are not really that at all. They are rather observations of phenomena believed to occur consistently under identical enviro nments. But logic cannot explain why electrons circle protons, or why the color red and the color blue are distinct, or why the Universe exists at all. Yet every one of our senses tells us that these things are so, and if we, as Descartes, deny the validity of our sensory input, we resign ourselves to insanity. Plato's faith derives from no greater and no lesser observation than things are what they seem to be. Once that consistency is granted, all else follows. The Chimaera: If that is so, why shoul d Plato have gone through all the trouble to create the dialogues? Merely as a blind fo r Sophist critics who might have interfered with his Academy or accused him personally of being irrational or illogical? The Sphinx: Again the explanation is not that simple. The dialogues may indeed have served as a blind for the Sophists, inasmuch as they defend Platonic principles according, apparently, to Sophistic logical cr iteria. But the dialogues would thus serve only a negative function, and that hardly seems to justify the obvious effo rt of their preparation. Plato was first and foremost a teacher, and he would ha ve designed the dialogues to teach. The Chimaera: That appears to run afoul of your prev ious statement that faith and reason are mutually exclusive. If Platonic students studie d the dialogues only to become skilled at the Sophistic argumentative proce dures employed therein, they would complete the Academy only as skilled Sophists. The Sphinx: We are at something of an impasse. I c onfess that I cannot resolve this evident inconsistency. Let us seek fresh counsel. Quite suddenly there materializes a Gryphon. The Gryphon: The dilemma can be resolved, but it is so constructed that it defies resolution by Sophistic logic. And that is precisely the trap into which th e two of you have fallen. Indeed the dialogues are there to teach, but the student must put forth the effort to see past the Sophistic teachings to th ose of Plato himself. The Chimaera: But the argumentative pattern of th e dialogues is Sophistic, and any connection between Sophistic lo gic and Platonic faith cannot exist. Do you think to pursue me? The Gryphon: The key to Plato rests in the Meno . Here — He turns to page #364: SOCRATES: Those who tell it ar e priests and priestesses of the sort who make it their business to be able to account for the functions which they perform. Pindar speaks of it too, and many another of the poets who are divinely inspired. What th ey say is this — see whether you think they are speaking the truth. They say that the soul of a man is immortal. At one time it comes to an end — that which is called deat h — and at another is born again, but is never finally exterminated. On these grounds a man must live all his days as righteously as possible. For those from whom Persephone receives requital for ancient doom In the ninth year she restores again Their souls to the Sun above"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"From whom rise noble kings And the swift in strength and greatest in wisdom, And for the rest of time They are called heroes and sanctified by men. Thus the soul, since it is immortal and has been born many times, and has seen all things both here and in the other world, has learned everything there is. So we need not be surprised if it can recall the knowledge of virtue or anything else which, as we see, it once possessed. All nature is akin, and the soul ha s learned everything, so that when a man has recalled a single piece of knowledge — learned it, in ordinary language — there is no reason why he should not find out all the rest, if he keeps a stout heart and does not grow weary of the search, for seeking and learning are in fact nothing but recollection. The Chimaera: You imply, then, that it is not the object of the dial ogues to \"teach\" at all — but rather to expose Plato's st udents to demanding mental gymnas tics which will inspire them to recollect knowledge of the Forms. The Gryphon: You have recollected admirably. The Gryphon dematerializes. The Sphinx: Is it not interesting that the example given by Socrates in the Meno employs mathematics and geometry? That ties in rather ne atly with the inscription over the entrance to the Academy. To the Platonic philosopher, then, that inscription would have meant something more than mere ability to calculate areas of triangles. In effect it would say: Let no one ignorant of the recollect ive basis of knowledge leave here. The Chimaera: Harking back to what you said concerning Plato's exposure to Pythagorean concepts, it is quite appropriate. Mathematical consistency was Plat o's \"foot in the door,\" so to speak, where the Forms were concerned. Yet, in view of relativity, does not that door slam shut upon us? The Sphinx: That's the Hades of it; it doesn't. Or rather it does, but another one opens simultaneously. The Chimaera: Do you mean that relativity provides access to another Form similar to mathematical consistency, upon which a modern Pl ato could base a Theory of the Forms? The Sphinx: No, not really. But what relativity has done has been to turn the Meno inside out. Look here: Socrates proves the im mortality of the soul by demons trating its intrinsic grasp of mathematics, which he considered a Form. Pa use here and consider: What, precisely, is immortality? The Chimaera: I should say the continuous ex istence of the mind or soul. The Sphinx: That would be the case if there were no such thing as relativity. But there is. So let us say rather that immortality is the abil ity of the mind or the soul to exist unbounded by time, i.e.: the fourth dimension. Mortality is measured according to the notion that time is a constant. But relativity disproves this, showi ng that time may be re tarded, hastened, stopped altogether, or, presumably, raised to infinity. Th us the prison of a so-cal led temporal span of existence is no real prison at al l. It is only imagined as such by a mind untrained in fourth"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"dimensional movement. The mind that is immortal is one that breaks free of time , not one that merely plods along within it as it ticks off the aeons. The Chimaera: And so the same principles of relativ ity that destroy Plato's first-known Form now open the door to the very immortality wh ich he sought through knowledge of the Forms. Fascinating ... The Sphinx: Now we must consid er the implications of this as applied to the notion of recollection of knowledge. When Socrates used the term in the passage cited by the Gryphon, he meant it of course in terms of a fixed four th dimension. He visuali zed the soul as plodding along through the aeons, \"seeing all things\" along the way. Thus, by the time it reached incarnation in Greece circa 400 BCE, it had comp leted some 9.5 to 10.5 billion years' \"sightseeing\" since the last Universal concentration of ra diation underwent transformation into matter and antimatter, making it possible for existence to displace vacuum. The Chimaera: Just out of curiosity, how do you come up with ten billion years? The Sphinx: Simply by dividing the distances of the known galaxies from the calculated metagalactic center of this expansion cycle by their speeds according to the Red Shifts, then taking an average. But we digress again. We must still work out the nature of the acquisition of knowledge. The Chimaera: If the invalidation of time as a constant has been shown, then the mind or soul could not have acquired knowledge via an aeonic si ght-seeing trip such as Socrates describes. But the mind possesses the capability to cast itse lf forward and backward through time, since time is not fixed. The Sphinx: Correct. The process is to imagination what directed thinking is to unconscious dreaming. It is something like the Raja-Yoga te chnique of uniting the mind to a single idea through force of Will, or like corresponding ceremonial magic techniques. The Chimaera: But I thought that the object of Yoga is to break the cycle of birth, death, rebirth through union of the soul or mind with the whole of ex istence. To one who achieves the eighth stage, samadhi, the concept of knowledge — itself a relative measurement of that which is known versus that which is not known — would be meaningless. All would be known, or, to use a more precise term, realize d. Nothing would remain to be \"learned.\" The Sphinx: Indeed. The Chimaera: I think I am beginning to see your point. There is an identity between the state of samadhi and the innate condition of the mind or soul as Plato perceived it. Both exist in a state of absolute awareness, including, presumably, the freedom to move through all dimensions including that of time. Thus they break the bonds of both a finite period and a finite path of existence, achieving true immortalit y. Earthly incarnation becomes a prison in terms of both time and space, and it is the incarna ted mind's ability to travel within time that allows it to break free from this prison. The am bition of Plato, like that of the Yogi, was to regain the freedom of mental movement thr ough all dimensions of existence — which, of course, would provide access to knowledge of the Forms."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Sphinx: That is right. And the final proof of this is that Adepts in all cultures and all ages have inclined towards this same realizati on, no matter what exploratory methods they may have used and what linguistic terminology they may have employed. \"Proof\" in the scientific sense is the achievement of identical result s under identical circumstances by independent researchers. Our comparison of just two initiator y systems — that of Pl ato and that of Yoga — meets these criteria exactly, gi ven that the \"identical circumst ance\" in this case is Earthly incarnation. The Chimaera: Similar evidence could be obtained from additional case studies of other initiatory systems. But one substantiation suffices for our discussion. The Sphinx: And now, I think, we are finally in a pos ition to understand Plato's distinction of the work of a true philosopher from th at of a Sophist. Let us return to The Sophist . He turns to page #998: STRANGER: Well, now that we have agreed that the kinds stand toward one another in the same way as regards blending, is not some science needed as a guide on the voyage of discourse, if one is to succeed in pointing out which kinds are c onsonant, and which are incompatible with one another — also, whether there are certain kinds that pervade them all and connect them so that they can blend, and again, where there are divisions [separations], whether there are certain others that traverse wholes and are responsible for the division? ... And the man who can do that discerns clearly one form everywhere extended throughout many, where each one lies apart, and many forms, different from one another, embraced from without by one form, and again one form connected in a unity through many wholes, and many forms, entirely marked off apart. That means knowing how to distinguish, kind by kind, in what ways the several kinds can or cannot combine. The Chimaera: I am well satisfied. Now that we ha ve resolved the questions raised by The Sophist , it seems necessary to consider The Statesman as well. The Sphinx: We know that The Statesman was written as a sequel to The Sophist — that Plato intended his ideal statesman to be antithetical to the \"worst possible kind\" of Sophist. Observe: He turns to page #1074. STRANGER: Therefore all who take part in one of these gove rnments — apart from the one based upon real knowledge — are to be distinguished from the true statesman. They are not statesmen; they are party leaders, leaders of bogus governments and themselves as bogus as their systems. The supreme imitators and trickste rs, they are of all Sophi sts the arch-Sophists. YOUNG SOCRATES: It seems to me that the wheel has come full circle, now that the title of Sophist goes to those who most deserve it, to the men who get themselves called political leaders. The Chimaera: That may be nothing more than anot her of Plato's invectives against the Sophists in general — a bit of name-calling with out real substance. Such seems to be the opinion of academic critics, who are prone to ignore this exchange. But let us reexamine Plato's alienation from the Sophists. As I said earlier: Even if we limit our scope to the school of Protagoras, we know that Sophistic thinking disavowed absolute knowledge. Despairing of at taining such knowledge, they regarded even"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"its pursuit as worthless. So th ey taught a sort of relativi stic pragmatism as the only sound basis for human affairs. Hence Protagoras' famous statement that man is the measure of all things. The Sphinx: We then considered the Pythagorean pr ecedents for Plato's conviction that the Universe adheres to absolute and not relative standards. But how doe s this tie in with The Statesman ? The Chimaera: The connection seems to be that Plat o considers statesmanship also to be absolute and not relative. Observe the following key passage: He turns to pages #1051-2. STRANGER: Must we not do now what we had to do when discussing the Sophist? We had to insist then on the admission of an additional postulate, that \"what is 'not x' nevertheless exists.\" We had to introduce this postulate b ecause the only alternativ e to asserting it which our argument left us was to allow the Sophist to escape definition altogether. In our present discussion too there is an additi onal postulate on which we must insist, and it is this: \"Excess and deficiency are measurable not only in relative terms, but also in respect of attainment of a norm or due measure.\" For if we cannot first gain assent to this postula te, we are bound to fail if we advance the claim that a man possesses st atecraft, or indeed that a man possesses any other of the special forms of knowledge that function in human society. YOUNG SOCRATES: In that case we must certainly follow the precedent and admit the additional postulate in our present discussion too. STRANGER: Our present task is greater than our previous one, Socrates, and we can hardly have forgotten what a very long time that t ook us. However, while discussing these problems, there is one thing to be said at the outset th at it is perfectly right and proper to say here. YOUNG SOCRATES: What is this? STRANGER: That when one day we come to give a full exposition of true accuracy in dialectic method, we shall find the need of th is postulate concerning the due measure which we have just enunciated. However, the statemen t in the form we have made it and with the demonstration — adequate for present purposes — which we have given of it, is a very great help to us, or so it seems to me. For it shows that two propositions stand or fall together. The first is that the arts exist; the second is th at excess and deficiency are measurable not only relatively but in terms of the re alization of a norm or due measure. Thus if measure in this second sense exists, so do the arts, and, conversel y, if there are arts, then there is this second kind of measurement. To deny either is to deny both. The Sphinx: The \"existence of 'not x' pos tulate,\" as I recall, left something to be desired in terms of logical integrity. The point hinged upon th ings that were not th emselves \"existence\" being able to exist. In distinguishing them fr om \"existence,\" Plato trea ts \"existence\" as an entity. But, when saying that certain things \"exist,\" he treat s \"exist\" as a quality. That is inconsistent and hence inconclusive. He glances at page #1003 i ndignantly, then turns to pages #1050-1. And what sort of demonstration of th is second postulate does he offer? STRANGER: On the one hand, will we not also be ready to assert that we do in fact hear words spoken and see acts done which at one ti me exceedr the essentially right measure and"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"at another time fall short of it? Is it not just this matter of attaining the due measure which marks off good men from bad in human society? The Chimaera: That's not much of a proof. The words or actions that impress one observer as ideal may strike another as excessive or inad equate. Similarly \"good\" and \"bad\" are subjective terms. Plato is guilty of a non sequitur . The Sphinx: True. If the stranger had b een talking with someone like Protagoras instead of the docile young Socrates, The Statesman would have floundered [and foundered] right there. The Chimaera: Note that, immediately after making that statement, Plato tries to reinforce it by denying that statecraft — or any other art — can exist without it. Thus he assumes that statecraft has already been prove d to be an absolute standard, when it fact it has not. Two unproved statements cannot be used to prove eac h other, and so Plato is guilty of a second logical fallacy, generally known as interdependence . The Sphinx: Since the rest of The Statesman hinges upon young Socrates' blind disregard of these two fallacies, is there a poi nt in our discussing it further? What we have uncovered here is not some relatively unimportant di gression. The subsequent structure of The Statesman is one of peeling away inadequate manifestations of statesmanship, leav ing, theoretically, the Form itself at the core. If there is not an ag reed-upon Form, then the peeling-away process is pointless. The Chimaera: To be fair to Plato, let us examine his idea of the Form of statesmanship. He turns to page #1077. STRANGER: If you will view the three arts we have spoken of as a group with a common character, you will be bound to see that none of them has turned out to be itself the art of statesmanship. This is because it is not the provi nce of the real kingly ar t to act for itself, but rather to control the work of the arts which in struct us in the methods of action. The kingly art controls them according to its power to perc eive the right occasions for undertaking and setting in motion the great enterprises of state. The other arts must do wh at they are told to do by the kingly art ... It is a universal art, and so we call it by a name of universal scope. That name is one which I believe to belong to this ar t and this alone, the name of \"statesmanship.\" The Sphinx: On the whole, that's not a bad definiti on. And, I might add, there is nothing in it which necessitates the existence of an absolute standard for statesmanship. A statesman can simply be a person who is relatively skill ed at emphasizing, dir ecting, and applying the various arts and sciences of a state or community. The Chimaera: So it would seem. In view of Plato's attack on \"archSophists\" as being the leaders of all but the perfect [Form] government, one might suspect that he insisted upon an absolute standard of government just so that he could attribute everythi ng less than that to Sophistry. Having delivered such an uncomplimen tary blow to both Sophists and politicians, Plato could quietly abandon the notion of an ab solute governmental standard. In fact, the definition that I just quoted is thoroughly relativistic and can not be applied in terms of absolute standards. The Sphinx: And just how do you draw that conclusion?"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Chimaera: If each subordinate art in a community possesses its own standard of absolute perfection, a raising or lowering of the application of that ar t by the statesman would cause excess or deficiency in the art itself. For ex ample, the military art involves winning battles and wars. If the statesman, for the good of the entire community, prevents the military from conducting battles or wars, the milit ary art itself experiences a de ficiency. At a later date, if the military does go to war, that deficiency will be evident as inexperience in combat. Similarly, if the statesman orders the military to fight too many battles or wars, excess will occur. The military will become inefficient through demoralization and attrition. To permit the military to function at an ideal level, a statesman would have to allow a level of continuous or intermittent warfare. This, obviou sly, would not be ideal for the state as a whole. The Sphinx: Your point being that the ideal level of a subor dinate art as a thing an sich is at odds with its ideal applicati on by the statesman's art. The Chimaera: Yes, and there's more to it than that. If there is an ideal standard or level for both component arts and the statesman's art, then the maintenance of that standard or level over a period of time should ensu re continuous and ideal prosperi ty for the state as a whole, correct? The Sphinx: Theoretically, yes. The Chimaera: But conditions outside that state will vary. A neighboring state may go to war against it, for example. The Sphinx: That would necessitate an alteration of certain component arts — such a materiel production, resource allocation, and military activ ity — by the statesman, if he is to perform his ideal role. The Chimaera: But this means exceeding or falling belo w the ideal standards of the individual component arts. In other words, the ideal standa rds of a component art by itself and the ideal level of that art as a factor in the overall comm unity do not coincide. Therefore, if Plato insists upon absolute standards, he pl aces his statesman in the posi tion of having to continuously violate the absolute standards of component arts for the sake of his own art. The Sphinx: I suppose Plato would argue that the ideal standards of the component arts would include consideration for the proper level of t hose arts within the community as a whole. The Chimaera: That still begs the question. The posture of the community mu st change as its external environment changes. Therefore the co mponent arts will be subject to continuous revision of their levels of activity and emphasis. They become factors relative to the community, just as the co mmunity becomes a factor relative to its external environment. Q.E.D. The Sphinx: So Plato's definition of statesmanship is valid only if both that art and the subordinate arts are assumed to be variable and relativistic . How intriguingly Sophistic! The Chimaera: ... All of which brings us back to the basic \"relativity vs. absolutism\" issue between [what Plato would call] Sophistry a nd Philosophy respectively. In a purely practical sense we cannot continue to use those terms as Plato did, because \"sophistry\" now conveys"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"the image of charlatanism, while \"philosophy\" embraces relativistic as well as absolutist theories. The Sphinx: True. The basic issue still remains, but the old labels are no longer accurate. Why do you suppose Plato felt so strongly that absolute standards (Forms) existed? The Chimaera: It probably started with what he be lieved to be common sense. Our senses seem to tell us that the world around us is made up of reliable and permanent phenomena. A chair can be counted upon to remain a chair, a desk a desk. The Sun and the planets behave regularly. Relativism carried to its logical conclusion would de ny these things. How could the Sophists say that \"man is the measure of all th ings\" as they walked about on the solid and permanent ground of Greece? Man cannot decide th at the ground will be there one minute and transmute to water the next. Plato must ha ve felt that he was arguing a case for the way things actually are , even if he encountered difficulties in justifying that position logically. The Sphinx: To be quite precise, a chai r does not remain a chair or a desk a desk. Both are undergoing continuous molecular breakdown, which is not apparent to humans because they normally experience sensory input at a relativel y swifter rate. Nor ar e astronomical bodies truly constant; they only seem that way, again be cause of the relative differences in their rates of change and in human perceptive powers. At th e other end of the scale, there are phenomena that occur too swiftly for human senses to regi ster them. So they seem \"instantaneous.\" So how dependable is Plato's \"actual world?\" The Chimaera: I am tempted to say that, relatively speaking [from the human point of view], the world appears to adhere to absolute laws. The Sphinx: Now that is an interesting statement! Y ou mean that the human ability to perceive relative change exists in a compara tively small range, and that phenomena changing at rates beneath or above that ra nge appear to be instantaneous or permanent, as the case may be. The Chimaera: I supposed so. The Sphinx: Can we not identify anything th at is truly permanent? That is in fact absolute and not relative? The Chimaera: That was Einstein's problem. He was able to postulate only one thing that was absolute — the speed of light. But in that he was wrong. The Sphinx: Wrong? Kindly explain! The Chimaera: We run the risk of straying rather far from The Statesman . The Sphinx: But not from our ultimate topic. Remember that we are trying to get a grip on true conceptual analysis, and to do that we had better resolve this relative / absolute issue once and for all. According to the Platonic school of thought, political science has an absolute standard, just as physical laws do. That is the argument of The Statesman . So now we have said that Einstein reduced physics to only one absolute — the speed of light — and you dispute even that. I for one cons ider a resolution of this german e. If you destroy absolutism in"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"the physical world, then the basis for attempting to parallel the \"absolut e physical world\" with an \"absolute political world\" di sappears altogether. So proceed. The Chimaera: All right. According to Einstein's sec ond fundamental postulate of the Special Theory of Relativity, the velocity of light is al ways constant relative to an observer, no matter how fast the observer and the light source may be separating or converging. A derived equation states that, when an object is moving with respect to an observer, the mass of the object becomes greater, the amount of increase depending upon the relative velocity of object and observer. As the mass of the object increases, its length along the axis of its direction will decrease. At the speed of light, the object's mass becomes infinite, and its length shrinks to zero. Since an infinite-plus amount of energy w ould be required to ra ise the speed of an infinite mass beyond the speed of light, such hyper-light speed is not possible. The Sphinx: So states the Special Theory. The Chimaera: Now, internally the Special Theory is consistent, because it treats the speed of light as a constant and incorpor ates a series of equations whic h rely upon that constant and are consistent with one another. As the Speci al Theory applies to phenomena which are substantially below the speed of light, it is practical. Th e interrelationship of mass and energy relative to 186,000 miles per second (the Einstein speed of li ght constant) has been formulated as E=mc2 and put into practice through nuclear fission. The Sphinx: Where, then, lies the fault? The Chimaera: The Achilles' Heel of the Special Theo ry is that, while ap plying the principle of relativity to everything else except the speed of light, it thereby treats the speed of light as an exception to the rule. An exception to a rule of physics is an indication that the rule is inadequate to cover all known phenomena. Einstein's decision to treat the speed of light as a constant was based upon the difference between the speed of light and non-light-wave-related phenomena being so vast as to make sub-186,000 mps light speed impossible to detect ; and also upon the inability of science to detect anything travelling fa ster than 186,000 mps. The Sphinx: Why this emphasis upon the word \"detect?\" The Chimaera: Detection and existence ar e two different things, and that difference is crucial to my argument. Now consider th is hypothesis: If light waves fr om a stationary source travel at 186,000 mps, and those light waves are the on ly means an observer located elsewhere has for detection of that source, what would happen if the source were to begin moving away from the observer at 186,001 mps? Those light waves that are the sole source of the observer's information would no longer reach that obser ver. The waves are now receding from him at 1 mps. As far as the observer can detect , the light-source vanished when its speed exceeded the speed of light. But did the source in fact cease to exist? It did not. [And its presence may be detectable by observing warps in radiation waves and emissions affected by it — a possible explanation of the \"Black Hole\" phenomenon.] The Sphinx: What about light-sources that are pr oceeding in directions other than diametrically away from an observer? The Chimaera: As for an object approaching an obs erver at 186,000+ mps, it would arrive before it could be detected at any distance as a moving object , because humans do not possess"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"instruments that can identify approaching light speeds in exce ss of 186,000 mps — which would be the only means of identifying the object's approach. If the source were to proceed at a tangent to an observer, it will seem to co mpress as it approaches the speed of light. The explanation for this illusion is more comple x, but I may approximate it by saying that the lateral movement / oscillation of the emitted light waves is less detectable as the lateral speed of the object approaches 186,000 mps. At 186,000 mp s the waves are no longer detectable as waves — merely as radiation; hence the illusion that the source has transmutated from matter to energy. The Sphinx: In fact, then, the Special Theory contains its own inva lidation. It states that everything is relative, but it cannot exis t as a formula wit hout at least one absolute constant — which, upon examination, proves to be relative itself. Which leaves only one question: If it is wrong, why does E=mc2 work ? The Chimaera: Because the values which are plugged into that formula are so far below 186,000 mps that the speed of light might as well be treated as a constant. For equations that include values closer to 186,000 mps, the form ula becomes increasingl y less accurate. Hence the preposterous calculation that a mass at 186,0 00 mps becomes infinite. That is simply the result of the formula's intrinsic distortion. The Sphinx: This is all very unsettling. So everything is relative? The Chimaera: Let's not jump to conclusions. Remember what we decided concerning Plato's own proof of absolute Forms? The Sphinx: Yes. I referred to the Platonic Academy's inscription, Let no one ignorant of mathematics enter here , and then I said: Plato saw in mathematics unshakable evidence th at there was an absolute standard for the Universe. And where one such standard existed, it was logical to assume that there were others. Today humans regard mathematics princi pally as an applied science, but in Plato's time it was considered by the Pythagoreans to be \"pure,\" having nothing to do with the gross and imperfect everyday world. The Chimaera: Would you care to el aborate upon that? The Sphinx: The best thing to do is to quote direc tly from Thomas Stanley's 1687 account of the Pythagorean doctrines, which draws its mate rial from Porphyrus, Iamblicus, Strabo, etc. The Stanley text materializes, and th e Sphinx turns to Part IX, page #522. Consider the following: [sic] The mind being purify'd [by Discipline] ought to be applied to things that are beneficial; these he procured by some contrived ways, bringing it by degrees to the cont emplation of eternal incorporeal things, which are ever in the same state; beginning orderly from the most minute, lest by the suddenness of the cha nge it should be diverted, and withdrew itself through its great and long pravity of nutriment. To this end, he first used the Mathematical Sciences, a nd those Speculations which are intermediate betwixt Corporeals and Incorporeals, (for they have a Threefold Dimension, like Bodies, but they are impassible like Incor poreals) as Degrees of Preparation to the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Contemplation of the things that are; diverting, by an artifici al Reason, the Eyes of the Mind from corporeal things (which never are perman ent in the same manner and estate) never so little to a desire of aliment; by means whereof, introducing the contemplation of things that are, he rendered men truly happy. This use he made of the Mathematical Sciences. These Sciences were first termed Mathemata * by Pythagoras upon consideration that all Mathesis (discipline) is Reminiscence, whic h comes not extrinsecally to souls as the phantasies which are formed by sensible objects in the Phantasie; nor are they an advantageous adscititious knowledg, like that wh ich is placed in Opinion; but it is excited from Phaenomena's, and perfected intrinseca lly by the cogitation converted into it self. The Chimaera: How very interesting. It would seem that the recollective basis of knowledge, heretofore assumed to be a Platonic concept, is in fact Pythagorean. The Sphinx: And the use of mathematics as a key to th is particular sort of knowledge, i.e.: of the Forms. The Chimaera: Who is this Stanley, and how reliab le can he be considered to be? The Sphinx: Thomas Stanley graduated from Cambridge at age 16 as a Master of Arts. He practiced law; was fluent in Fr ench, Italian, Spanish, and the Classical languages; and issued the first volume of his famous History of Philosophy when he was only 30. The three paragraphs cited above are all foot noted to original Greek sources. The Chimaera: So Plato used mathematics as a \"place to stand,\" in an effort to make the Universe intelligible by reason alone. And Platonists tend to emphasize this, shielding Plato from the despised title of \"mystic.\" See here: He indicates page #x v in the Collected Dialogues. [Huntington Cairns:] But the difference between Plato and the mysticism that has attached itself to his philosophy is essential. Plato's aim is to take the read er by steps, with as severe a logic as the conversational method permits, to an insight into the ultimate necessity of Reason. And he never hesitates to submit his own ideas to the harshest critical scrutiny; he carried this procedure so far in the Parmenides that some commentator s have held that his own doubts in this dialogue prevail over his affi rmations. But the beliefs of mystics are not products of critical examination a nd logical clarification; they are, on the c ontrary, a series of apprehensions, flashes, based on feeling, denying the rational order. The my stic's reports of his experiences are beyond discussion inasmuch as they are subjective and emotional; they must be accepted, by one who wishes to beli eve them, as a matter of faith, not knowledge. Plato's view of the world is that of an inte lligible system that man can know by disciplined intellect alone. He was, in fact, the founder of logic, a logician and a poet, but he was not a mystic, he never exalted feeling above reason. The Sphinx: Well, well. What do you think Cairns would say to the following quote from The Statesman ? He turns to page #1082. STRANGER: When there arises in the soul of men a right opinion concerning what is good, just, and profitable, and what is the opposite of these — an opinion based on absolute truth and settled as an unshakable conviction — I decl are that such a convic tion is a manifestation of the divine occurring in a race which is in truth of supernatural lineage."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"YOUNG SOCRATES: It could no be more suitably described. The Chimaera (dryly): He would probably say that, si nce sphinxes and chimaeras do not really exist, nothing we say is to be taken seriously. The Sphinx: So, where Plato is concerned, a great d eal hinges upon the basis for mathematics itself. Is it acquired through reason or th rough mystical vision, so to speak? The Chimaera: This is rather curious. Plato actually sets his dialectic process in contrast to mathematics, almost as though the object of the Dialogues is to arrive at a Form greater than that of mathematics. He turns to page #746. I understand, he said, not fully, fo r it is no slight task that you a ppear to have in mind, but I do understand that you mean to distinguish the aspect of reality and the intelligible, which is contemplated by the power of dialectic, as some thing truer and more ex act than the object of the so-called arts and sciences whose assump tions are arbitrary star ting points. And though it is true that those who contemplate them are compelled to use their understanding and not their senses, yet because they do not go back to the beginning in the study of them but start from assumptions you do not think they possess true intelligence about them although the things themselves are intelligibles when apprehended in conjunction with a first principle. And I think you call the mental habit of geometer s and their like mind or understanding and not reason because you regard understanding as so mething intermediate between opinion and reason. The Sphinx: It's all very well for Plato to say that , and I'm sure that dialecticians are not displeased to consider themselves more inte llectual than mathematicians. Yet we have found, in both The Sophist and The Statesman , that Plato cannot proceed with his arguments unless he assumes the divinely inspired ability to pe rceive not only greater, but absolute perfection when he is confronted with it. That is not r eason; it is revelation. Plat o does mathematics an injustice: While mathematicians openly admit th at their conclusions are originally based upon assumptions (axioms), Plato pretends that his are not. And of course they are. Just as Einstein required a concrete assumption — a constant speed of light — upon which to build his mathematical philosophy, so Plato must have an assumption — the ability to recognize absolute perfection — upon which to build his dialectic philosophy. The Chimaera: Plato seems to be caught in a trap between the relativistic Sophists on one hand — who denied the reliability of intuitiv e assumptions — and the Pythagoreans on the other — who permitted original assumptions via revelation/intuition. Plato rejects the notion that axioms are necessary for reason, yet he cannot reason wi thout them. No wonder he was so touchy about the Sophists. The Sphinx: Note the very precise manner in which the Pythagoreans discussed the original assumptions of mathematics: Again he indicates page #522 of the Stanley text. The whole science of Mathematicks, the Pythagor eans divided into four parts, attributing one to Multitude, another to Magnitude; and subdi viding each of these into two. For Multitude either subsists by it self, or is consider'd with re spect to another; Magnitude either stands still, or is moved. Arithmetick contemplates Multitude in it self: Musick with respect to another: Geometry, unmoveable magnitude; Sphaerick, moveable."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"These Sciences consider not Mult itude and Magnitude simply, but in each of these that which is determinate: for Sciences consider this abstr acted from infinite, that they may not (in vain) attempt in each of these that which is infinite . When therefore the wise persons say thus, we conceive it is not to be understood of that multitude which is in the sensible things themselves, nor of that magnitude which we per ceive in bodies, for the contemplation of these I think pertains to Physick, not to Mathema tick. But because the Maker of all things took Union and Division, and Identity, and Alterity, and Station and Motion to compleat the soul, and framed it of these kinds, as Timaeus teac heth, we must conceive that the Intellect, consisting according to the diversity thereof, and the division of proportions and multitude, and knowing it self to be both one and many, pr oposeth numbers to it self, and produceth them and the Arithmetical knowledg of them . According to the union of multitude and communication with it self, and colligation, it ac quireth to it self Musick: for which reason Arithmetick excels Musick in antiquity, the soul it self being first divided by the Maker, then collected by proportions. And agai n establishing the operation with in it self, according to its station, it produceth Geometry out of it self, and one figure, and the principles of all figures, but according to its motion, Sphaerick: for she is moved by circles, but consists always in the same manner according to the causes of those circle s, the straight and the circular: and for this reason likewise Geometry is precedent to Sphaerick, as Station is to Motion. But forasmuch as the Soul produced these Scie nces, not looking on th e excitation of Ideas, which is of infinite power, but upon the boundure of that which is limited in their several kinds, therefore they say that they take in finite from multitude and magnitude, and are conversant only about finite: for the mind hath placed in her self all principles both of multitude and magnitude, because being wholly of like parts within her self, and being one and indivisible, and again di visible, and producing the worl d of Ideas, it doth participate essential finiteness and infiniteness from the things which it doth understand: But it understands according to that which is finite in them, and not according to the infiniteness of its life. This is the opinion of the Pythagor eans, and their division of the four Sciences. Hitherto Proclus. The Chimaera: In the final analysis, whether Cairns would enjoy the idea or not, Plato must be classed with the Pythagoreans as a \"mystic ,\" in that he assumed that humans possess a supernatural power beyond reason to r ecognize perfection/absolute Forms. The Sphinx: Yes. The Sophists were the only ones who could claim to be \"nonmystics,\" because they would not admit to revealed accuracy of any sort. Plato tried to strike a balance between the Sophists and the Pythagoreans, but there is just no halfway position that holds water. The Pythagoreans would have been amused by Plato's laborious argumentative process, holding it to be a waste of time, in that the final answer to a given problem could be known only by revelation/recollectio n. As for the Sophists, they would have faulted Plato's arguments by denying the primary assu mptions/revelations in them. The Chimaera: All of which leaves us where? The Sphinx: Well, I think we have pr etty well finished with The Statesman . But our discussion concerning the Pythagorean aspects of \"Plato's \" philosophy raises yet another question: To what extent was Plato an original thinker? The Chimaera: On that thorny little problem I will let you take the lead ..."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Sphinx: I think we would be wise to start with some observations about time — not just the way most humans regard it, but the way Pl ato himself perceived it. I recall a pertinent comment of G.J. Whitrow's in his book The Nature of Time 1 : The first question to consider is the origin of the idea that time is a kind of linear progression measured by the clock and the calendar. In m odern civilization this conception of time so dominates our lives that it seems to be an in escapable necessity of thought. But this is far from true ... Most civilizations, prior to our own of the last tw o or three hundred years, have tended to regard time as essentially cyclic in nature. In the light of history, our conception of time is as exceptional as our rejection of magic. The Chimaera: Well said. Modern academicians are conditioned to an essentially Newtonian attitude towards time. They regard it as a simple progression of events. The past may be referred to, and visions of the future may be projected, but ne ither past nor future has any intrinsic effect upon the present — nor do they exist objectively at all. The Sphinx: In a cyclical system of time, by contrast , past, present, and future would all be part of a single continuum. This wouldn't necessa rily mean that \"history repeats itself\" either. Rather the components of fourth dimensional ex istence would continue to exist, although they might be undergoing periodic rearrangement a nd recomposition. One might draw an analogy to the interchangeability of matter and energy; a seemingly endless variety of transmutation takes place, but the \"sum of the whole\" remains the same. The Chimaera: Take the Platonic notion of the transm igration of souls. It wouldn't make much sense if entirely new souls could come into being \" out of nothing,\" would it? Yet the transmigration theory has been ridiculed on the grounds that (a) world population is expanding, and (b) past incarnations have not been recalled to sta ndards of scien tific proof. If \"the stuff of which souls are made\" can transmutate from other components of a unified time- continuum, then the first objection disapp ears. And limited recomposition [short of transmutation] would account for the second. The Sphinx: And this would put the c oncept of the recollective ba sis of knowledge in a new light as well. Instead of knowledge being cumu lative or progressive [again a purely linear concept] with the linear \"passa ge\" of time, it can be consider ed \"circular\" — rearrangements and recombinations of certain all-inclusive principles whic h are part of the cyclical continuum, i.e.: \"timeless.\" The Chimaera: A provocative way of approachin g the Theory of the Forms ... The Sphinx: Let us try to \"clear the air\" of modern presuppositions and place ourselves in the time-environment that Plato himself perceive d. As he looked at the world around him and observed changes taking place, wouldn't linear ti me have seemed obvious to him? Within the scope of his own consciousness, for example, he could tell that things \"weren't the way they used to be\" and that new events were regularly taking place. The Chimaera: On a small scale, yes. But, seen at th e \"Forms level,\" various events could be viewed as modifications of a single Form of political behavior or as more complex combinations involving more than one Form. Th us the conquest of Athens by Sparta or the conquest of Sparta by Athens were essentially variations on the same Form [of conquest], distinguished by variable appli cations of other Forms [such as economic pressures, military"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"power, political imperialism, etc.]. Viewed in th is context, events could indeed be considered cyclical. The Sphinx: Well, have we justification to presume th at Plato truly thought in that context? After all, it is a perspective so broad that it co uld have been attacked as useless for concrete applications. In point of fact this was the basic Sophist criticism of Plato — that his philosophy, while it might be true on a macroc osmic scale — was of no help to people who were trying to solve immediate problems. So the Sophists advocated problem solving techniques that ignored macrocosmic Forms. The Chimaera: In the Republic , Laws , and Statesman we have three attempts by Plato to make his political philosophy relevant. Bu t it would be a mistake to say that he merely attempted to \"scale down\" this Form or that Form to a problem solving level, in order to compete with the Sophists. A Form is not that sort of \"thing;\" it is not an axiom which can be applied to various problems. Rather it is a sort of sum-total of identifying characteristics in various phenomena which relate them, as sphinxes and chimaeras ar e variations of the Form \"mythical beast.\" The Sphinx: Speak for yourself. But we have now r eached a point where we can explore the development of Forms-theory prior to Plato's tim e ... excuse me, Plato's point of focus in the continuum. Because the Forms — and especia lly the ones that we re applicable to statesmanship — weren't all that nebulous. In fact they were the guiding principles of the most ancient civilization in the Mediterranean — and the one with the most highly developed political system as well. I am talking, of course, about Egypt. The Chimaera: The most highly developed political system? You're going to get some objections on that score. The accepted impressi on of Egypt is that it was a simple military monarchy, reinforced by a death-obsessed re ligion, which cared not hing for philosophy. I quote Bertrand Russell: 2 Philosophy begins with Thales, w ho, fortunately, can be dated by th e fact that he predicted an eclipse which, according to the astronomers, occurred in the year 585 B.C. Philosophy and science — which were not originally separa te — were therefore born together at the beginning of the sixth century. The Sphinx: Bertrand Russell was ever quaint. \"Sixth century\" my claw! For thirty recorded centuries before Thales, Egypt had existed as a na tional system — not a mere city-state or even federation of citystates. It was older to the Greeks than the Greeks are to present-day humans. Scientifically it devel oped architecture to a precisio n unapproached again until the present century [and in some aspects still unequalled]. 3 It developed elab orate, codified medical skills [including that of open-skull brain surgery] which were used with a high measure of success. 4 It possessed the only accurate calendar in the entire Mediterranean until the time of Julius Caesar [when Caesar in troduced a modified Egyptian calendar to the Roman Empire]; the Egyptians' own records date back to 4241 BCE ! 5 And what of the hieroglyphic alphabet, introduced mo re than seven thousand years ago? 6 The Chimaera: I expect that part of the problem lies in the fact that the alphabet you just mentioned was so very hard to read. Indeed it was almost a sort of cipher used exclusively among the Egyptian intelligentsia. Training of a scribe took about twelve years, and even then a scribe was not in a position to understand th e significance of most of the philosophical material he was recording. By Plato's time ot her, less complex linguistic systems had come"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"into use for both reading and writing, and proba bly no one in Athens could read hieroglyphic, let alone gain access to philosophical texts hoar ded by the Egyptian priesthoods. So it is not so very surprising that Egyptian philosophy was not discussed by the Greeks, except for tourist-type accounts such as that of Herodotus and the E gyptian passage of Plato's own Timaeus . The Sphinx: The last known use of hi eroglyphic writing even in E gypt itself was in 394 CE [on the Temple of Isis at Philae]. Thereafter all knowledge of the la nguage vanished from human knowledge until Champollion decoded the Rosetta Stone in 1822 CE. And only a small number of Egyptian texts have been tran slated today — by a smaller handful of people who can read the language. So perhaps Russell's statement can be partially excused, if not condoned. The Chimaera: Then, too, Egypt has suffered a sava ge pillaging over the centuries. As a symbol of \"heathen paganism\" it was viciously despoiled by the early Christians and their Moslem successors. Countless ancient temples were either appropriated or razed by the Catholics, and thousands of statues and inscrip tions were disfigured. In 389 CE a Christian mob, acting on the orders of the Christian Ro man Emperor Theodosius, burned the great library of Alexandria to the ground. 7 Even so, millions of book-rolls were rescued or gathered together from other repositories and the libra ry was reestablished — until 636. In that year Alexandria was taken by Omar, the Third Calip h of Islam, who decreed: \"The contents of these books are in conformity with the Koran or they are not. If they are, the Koran is sufficient without them; if not, they are pernic ious. Therefore let them be destroyed.\" They were burned as fuel to heat the city's baths; it took six months for all of them to be consumed. 8 So it is not too surprising that modern re searchers have only a pitiful few scraps of information from previously undiscovered tombs or overlooked monuments. The Sphinx: Before we explore the links between the Egyptians and Plato, it may help if we bring out some of the salient ch aracteristics of the Egyptian polit ical system. To begin with, it was cyclic rather than linear . Individual Pharaohs and dynastie s came and went, but the social system and political structure remained consta nt. Each successive Pharaoh, for example, was merely the momentary personification of a perman ent, semi-divine entity that governed Egypt in the name of the gods. The nation itself was not viewed as merely one in a series of political units located in northeast Africa; it had existed as a divine cr eation before recorded history, and it would continue to exist indefinitely. Various natural cy cles and human lifetimes would impact upon it, but the essence of Egypt would remain untouched by [linear] time. 9 Consider, for example, the following hieroglyphic inscription accompanying an image of the scarab- beetle Xepera , principle of cyclical regeneration and immortality: I was the spirit in the Primeval Waters. 10 He who had no companion when his name Came Into Being. The most ancient form in which I Came Into Being was as a drowned one. I was he who Came Into Being as a circle. He who was the Dweller in his Egg. I was the one who began everything, th e Dweller in the Primeval Waters. First the Wind emerged for me, and then I began to move. I created my limbs in my glory. I was the maker of myself; I formed myself acco rding to my desire and in accord with my heart."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Chimaera: If each Pharaoh was held to be divinely appointed, what was the actual selection procedure? And how could a human -supervised selection procedure retain credibility as a divine process? The Sphinx: It compares rather intriguingly with the system for selection of Philosopher- Kings in the Republic . During stable dynasties new Pharaohs were selected from among the male offspring of the late Pharaoh. There was mo re latitude in this process than one might think because (a) Pharaohs generally had many wives and concubines, resulting in scores of children, and (b) the education and selection of Pharaohs were ha ndled by colleges of priests, themselves detached from the secular government but exercising a sort of guardianship over it. Unsuitable princes were either diverted to harmless careers or simply assassinated. With the exception of a few temporary puppet-kings or usurpers, then, Egyptian monarchs were generally Priest-Kings [an intentional re ference to the Atlantean term in the Critias ] of exceptional calibre. Incumbent Phar aohs who began to behave in maverick fashion [such as Akhenaten, the monotheist mystic of the XVIII Dyna sty] were also assassinated with the tacit consent of the priesthood. This method of \"impeachment\" does not seem to have been abused, because an attack on the divine Pharaoh for pur ely partisan motives would have been thought extremely ill-omened. Only for an obvious betr ayal of the Pharaoh's sacred trust — as determined by the priesthood — could assassination be contemplated. The Chimaera: What sort of legal system did the Egyptians have? The Sphinx: Now we enter some particularly interest ing territory from a Platonic standpoint. As far as can be deduced from surviving record s, bureaucratic and judi cial affairs were not conducted according to a central ized legal code superior to the judgment of individual officials. Such officials were given a more-or-less free hand w ithin their respective areas of responsibility — contingent, of course, upon the ma intenance of order, payment of taxes, and general preservation of a harmonious attitude among the people There were no legislated standards of good and evil/right and wrong. Justice was meted out ad hoc according to each supervisory official's concept of fairness and eq uity. The Egyptians prized this system very highly; it was personified by the goddess Maat . When an Egyptian died, a feather from Maat's crown would be weighed against his heart to determine whether he would be granted a pleasant repose in Amenti or be torn limb from limb by monsters from the Tuat. I expect that would-be crooks were inhibited accordingly, since the Egyptian religion was taken quite literally. Consider the followi ng inscription, dating from one of the earliest Old Kingdom dynasties of Egypt [and comp are it to the concept of Tao ]: 11 If thou art a leader who direct s the affairs of a multitude, st rive after every excellence until there be no fault in thy nature. Maat is good, and its worth is lasting. It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator, whereas he who tran sgresses its ordinances is punished. It lies as a path even in front of him who knows nothi ng. Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to part. It is true that evil ma y gain wealth, but the st rength of truth is th at it lasts; a man can say, \"It was the propert y of my father.\" The Chimaera: A rather interesting contrast to th e governments of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Greece, all of which laid stress upon codified la w. I expect you are leading up to a comparison to the Republic and Statesman , wherein Plato argues for specifi cally-trained or speciallygifted rulers above the law. Are you going to suggest that Plato took th e Egyptian system as an ideal governmental model?"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Sphinx: Let's not jump the spear on this. I have a few other points to make concerning the Egyptian system proper; then we'll look into th e matter of its actual lin ks with Plato. Again bearing the recommendations of the Republic in mind, consider the following: Almost uniquely within the ancient world, Egypt was free from hereditary caste, racial, or sexual discrimination in political affair s. A social aristocracy was cr eated by property inheritance, but a scion of poor or even unknown parentage mi ght just as easily rise to high office upon demonstrating suitable prowess. At various times the throne was held by Negroes, Persians, Mesopotamians, Greeks, and assorted Asians wi thout racial objections being raised. Women enjoyed the same \"citizenship\" status as men, including choice of mate and inheritance of property. Queens such as Nefertiti and Ty wielded as much or mo re power than their consorts, and female Pharaohs such as Hatshepsut and Cl eopatra ruled Egypt as de cisively and with as much popular support as did male Pharaohs. Ev en in the Egyptian religious pantheon, gods and goddesses enjoyed equal prestige. The Chimaera: To an observer this ex traordinary flexibility and tolerance might well account for the staying power of the Egyptian system, in spite of the occasional invasions, occupations, and even civil wars that took place there. When the dust cleared, so to speak, the political and social institutions remained intact. The Sphinx: Precisely. Egypt was no more a utopia than any other human run society was, is, or will be. There were power struggles, epid emics of corruption, popular revolts, and all the rest. During the Middle Ki ngdom (2150-1792 BCE) a pessimistic Pharaoh Amenemhet I advised Crown Prince Senwosret: Harken to that which I say to thee, 12 That thou mayest be king of the earth, That thou mayest be ruler of the lands, That thou mayest increase good. Harden thyself against all subordinates. The people give heed to him who terrorizes them; Approach them not alone. Fill not thy heart with a brother, Know not a friend, Nor make for thyself intimates, Wherein there is no end. When thou sleepest, guard for thyself thine own heart; For a man has no people in the day of evil. I gave to the beggar, I nourished the orphan; I admitted the insignificant, as well as him who was of great account. But he who ate my food made insurrection; He to whom I gave my hand aroused fear in my heart. The Chimaera: But the institutions survived, and on th e whole Egyptians were able to boast of a far more stable, prosperous, and inspiring society than those of the other Mediterranean countries. That is your point? The Sphinx: Yes. By contrast the Greece of Plato's tim e was in pretty sorry shape. The various city-states couldn't even maintain stable governments of th eir own, much less get along with each other. Elitist systems such as that of Sp arta were vulnerable to tyranny by strongmen; democratic Athens suffered from demagoguery and dictatorships. The much vaunted"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"philosophers were tolerated only as long as they were not thought to be actual threats. When they were inconvenient, as Plato and Aris totle had occasion to observe, hemlock or banishment awaited. Great principles of religi on and/or philosophy were ridiculed in favor of Sophistic opportunism. Yet — and I think this is an important point — the Greeks had demonstrated that they were quite capable of high intellectual achievement. They had produced a number of noteworthy philosophers, ar tists, statesmen, architects, and military leaders. What they had not produced was a stable cultural environment in which such talent could be nurtured. In his politically oriented di alogues, therefore, Pl ato sought a system of government that could achieve this stability with out being as dictatorial as, say, the Persian or Assyrian monarchies. In Egypt, if in fact he realized it, he had a near-exact functioning model of his Republic — and one which was working quite well. The Chimaera: ... If he realized it! So the problem is now to discover what connections, if any, Plato had with Egypt. Ar e the Dialogues of any help? The Sphinx: No, they aren't. There are a very few passing references to Egypt, but nothing of any substance. It would be disc ouraging if it were not for the fact that the Pythagoreans are similarly ignored. That makes the situation a bit suspect. If Plato's links with Egypt are tenuous, his links with the Pythagoreans ar e beyond doubt. The geometric passages in the Timaeus are virtually pure Pythagorean doctrine. And, from a political point of view, the Pythagoreans represented the extreme of initiated elitism that Plato juxtaposed to Sophistry. To the Sophists, human values were purely re lative to custom, convention, and practical necessity; to the Pythagoreans, values were eternal, unchanging, and universal — the \"Platonic\" Forms. How is it that the Pythagor eans came to hold this po int of view? Let us look to Pythagoras himself for the answer. The Chimaera: Back to the Stanley text. I see that mo st of its biographical entries concerning Pythagoras are footnoted to Iamblicus, a four th century CE Neoplatonist, and from Diogenes Laertius, writing about a century earlier. Specifi c passages dealing with Pythagoras' stay in Egypt are footnoted to Porphyrus and Clemens Al exandrinus as well. In Chapter III \"How he travelled to Phoenicia\" we read: 13 ... He made a voyage to Sidon, as well out of a na tural desire to the pl ace itself, esteeming it his country, as conceiving that he might more easily pass from thence into Egypt. Here he conferred with the Prophets, successors of Mocus the Physiologist, and with others, and with the Phoenician Priests, and was initia ted into all the mysterie s of Byblus, and Tyre, and sundry of the principal sacred institutions in divers other parts of Syria, not undergoing these things out of Superstition, as may be imag ined; but out of love to knowledg, and a fear, lest any thing worthy to be known, which was preserved amongst them, in the miracles or mysteries of the gods, might escape him. Withal, not being ignorant, that the rites of those places were deduced from the Egyptian ceremonies, by means whereof he hoped to participate of the more sublime and divine mysteries in Egypt, which he pursued with admiration, as his Master Thales had advised him. The Sphinx: Two rather intriguing points — first that Mesopotamian initiatory priesthoods were thought to be corruptions or derivations of their Egyptian counterparts, and secondly that Pythagoras undertook his quest on th e advice of Thales. Thales was reputed to have been born of a Phoenician mother, and it is more-or-less re liably established that he studied the science of geometry in Egypt. 14 But please continue ..."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Chimaera: Here are some extracts from Chapter IV \"How he travell'd to Egypt\": 15 Antiphon, in his Book concerning such as were em inent for virtue, exto lleth his perceverance when he was in Egypt, saying, Pythagoras designing to become acquainted with the institution of the Egyptian Priests, and diligently endeavorin g to participate thereof, desired Polycrates the Tyrant to write to Amasis King of Egypt, w ith whom he had friendship (as appears also by Herodotus) and hospitality, (formerly) that he might be admitted to the aforesaid Doctrine. Coming to Amasis, Amasis gave him Letters to the Priests, and goi ng first to those of Heliopolis, they sent him to the Priest of Memphi s, as the more ancient, which was indeed but a pretence of the Heliopolitans: [For the Egyptia ns imparted not their mysteries to every one, nor committed the knowledg of Divine things to profane persons, but to those only who were to inherit the Kingdom; and, of Priests, to t hose who were adjudged to excel the rest in education, learning, and descent.] From Memphi s, upon the same pretence, he was sent to Thebes. They not daring, for fear of the King, to pretend excuses; but thinking, that by reason of the greatness and difficulty thereof, he w ould desist from the design, enjoyned him very hard precepts, wholly different from the in stitution of the Grecians, which he readily performed, to their so great admiration, that they gave him power to sacrifice to the gods, and to acquaint himself with all thei r studies, which was never known to have been granted to any forraigner besides. Clemens Alexandrinus rela tes particularly, that he was disciple to Sonchedes, an Egyptian Arch-prophet. The Sphinx: Again something catches my eye — th at comment about Egyptian initiation normally being reserved for the Phar aoh and the priesthood alone. In the Statesman Plato writes: 16 For the priest and the diviner have great so cial standing and a keen sense of their own importance. They win veneration and respect beca use of the high tasks they undertake. This is shown in the fact that in Egypt none can be king unless he belongs to the priestly caste, and if a man of some other caste succeeds in forcing hi s way to the throne, he must then be made a priest by special ordination. The Chimaera: Now how would Plato come to know that bit of information, unless he were party to policies within the Egyptian priesthoods? The Sphinx: It is always possible th at he heard it from the Pythagoreans, although it seems only incidental to the sort of doc trines that Pythagoreans would be inclined to discuss. So here we may have a link directly be tween Plato and the E gyptian initiatory orders. Continue with the material from Stanley ... The Chimaera: 17 Diogenes saith, that whilst he lived with these Pr iests, he was instructed in the Learning and Language (as Antiphon also affirms) of the E gyptians, and in their three kinds of writing, Epistolick, Hieroglyphick, and Symbolick; whereof one imitates the common way of speaking; the rest allegorical, by AEnigms. They who are taught by the Egyptians, learn first the method of all the Egyptian Letters, which is called Epistilographick ; the second, Hieratick, used by those who write of sacr ed things; the last and most perfect Hieroglyphick, whereof one is Curiologick, the other, Symbolick. Of the Symbolick, one is properly spoken by imitation, another is written as it were Tropi cally; another on the cont rary doth allegorize by AEnigms. For instance, in the Kyriologick way, to express the Sun, they make a Circle; the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Moon a Crescent. Tropically they do prope rly traduce, and transfer, and express by exchanging some things, and variously transfi guring others. Thus when they deliver the praises of Kings, in Theological Fables, they write by Anaglyphicks. Of the third kind, by AEnigms, let this be an example: All other Stars, by reason of their oblique course, they likened to the bodies of serpents. But the Sun to that of a Beetle, because having formed a ball of Cow-dung, and lying upon its back, it ro lls it about (from claw to claw). The Sphinx: Once again there is more here than meets the eye. It is possible that Iamblicus or one of the other sources could have made up the ot her details of a trip by Pythagoras to Egypt, but here we seem to have conclusive proof — both of the trip itself and of Pythagoras' initiation. For the description given of the Egyptian linguistic system is in complete agreement with what has come to light w ith the discoveries of Champollion and Young. 18 Stanley could not have known this, and it is hi ghly improbable that Iamblicus or any of the other biographers could have known it either . Hieroglyphic writing wa s a closely guarded skill in Egypt, and, as we noted earlier, its teaching required many years of study. Pythagoras' initiation seems all the more probable. The Chimaera: Here is the concluding passage from the chapter: 19 Thus being acquainted with the learning of that Nation, and e nquiring into the Commentaries of the priests of former times, he knew the obs ervations of innumerable Ages, as Valerius Maximus saith. And living admir'd and belov'd of all the priests and prophets with whom he conversed, he informed himself by their mean s accurately, concerni ng every thing; not omitting any person, eminent at that time for l earning, or any kind of religious rites; nor leaving any place unseen, by going into which he conceived, that he might find something extraordinary. [For he went into the Adyta of the Egyptians, (and, as Clemens saith, permitted himself to that end to be circumcised) and le arned things not to be communicated concerning the gods, mystick Philosophy.] He travelled to all the Priests, and was instructed by every one, in that wherein they were particularly learned. In Egypt he lived twenty two years, in their private sacred places, studying Astronomy and Geometry, and was initiated (not cursorily or casually) into all the religious mysteries of the gods. Laertius saith, He made three Cups of silver, and presented them to each [Society] of the Egyptian Priests; which, as we said, were three, of Heliopolis, Memphis, and Thebes. The Sphinx: It is perhaps worthy of note that the s ources cited by Stanley lived at points of time when the bulk of the material from the library at Alexandria still existed. It is not unreasonable to assume that they would have eith er taken or verified their accounts from such records as they could read [in Greek if not in hieroglyphic] from that institution. At the time its prominence was unparalleled by any other literary repository in the Medite rranean, and it is hard to imagine scholars — particularly ones dealing with such a subject as this — bypassing it. The Chimaera: The highly selective \"cl ubs\" or schools which Pythagor as established in Sicily and southern Italy seem to align more closely to the fashion of the E gyptian priesthoods than to schools of the Greek tradition. Stanley, quoti ng Iamblicus, makes this point and hints that Pythagoras' exacting methods were not well received: 20 ... His country summoned him to some publick employment, that he might benefit the generality, and communicate his knowledge: which he not refusing, endeavored to instruct them in the symbolical way of learning, altogeth er resembling that of the Egyptians, in which"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"he himself had been instituted. But the Sa mians not affecting this way, did not apply themselves to him. The Sphinx: I think we have satisfact orily established the links between Pythagoras and the Egyptian priesthoods. Now we must determine to what extent the Egyptian doctrines reached Plato, either directly or through the Pythagoreans. The Chimaera: Stanley quotes the following passage from Porphyrus: 21 Moderatus saith, That this (Pythagorick Philoso phy) came at last to be extinguished, first, because it was aenigmatical; next, because their Wr itings were in the Dorick Dialect, which is obscure, by which means, the Doctrines delive red in it were not unde rstood, being spurious and misapprehended, because (moreover) they who publish'd them were not Pythagoreans. Besides, Plato, Aristotle, Speusippus, Arist oxenus, and Xenocrates, as the Pythagoreans affirm, vented the best of them, as their own, changing only some few things in them; but the more vulgar and trivial, and wh atsoever was afterwards inve nted by envious and calumnious persons, to cast a contempt upon the Pythagor ean School, they collected and delivered as proper to that Sect. The Sphinx: That certainly doesn't appear to be too complimentary to Plato. Yet the fact remains that the cosmological philosophy in the Timaeus is indisputably Pythagorean, yet is nowhere credited by Plato to the Pythagoreans or to Pythagoras himself. What of the Pythagoreans' political doctrines? The Chimaera: In The Genesis of Plato's Thought , Alban D. Winspear summarizes them succinctly, if less exhaustively than Stanley: 22 It is true that Pythagoras hims elf seems to have held no elective office in any Greek state. His function was rather to organize political cl ubs which busied themselves with practical political affairs and developed a general inte llectual apologia for aristocratic rule. [Quoting Iamblicus] The Pythagoreans met in caucuses and gave counsel about political affairs. With the passage of time, it came about that the young men not only took the lead in domestic matters but in public too; they came to govern the city, forming a great political club. For they were more than three hundred in number. It is in this connection not w ithout significant that Pythagoras himself held (according to one authority) [Stobaeus] that all income should come from agriculture. Here we have a hint of that same prejudice against the merchants and the democracy, that defense of the position of the landed proprietor which so constantly recurs in Greek idealistic thinkers. Once this point is understood, the philosophica l teachings of the Pythagoreans becomes intelligible. A passage from Iamblicus (which goes back to Aristoxenus) gives their point of view very clearly, and we must connect it with our previous discussion about the importance of the problem of justice: Pythagoras thought that the most efficacious de vice for the establishmen t of justice was the rule of the gods, and beginning with that he es tablished the state and the laws, justice and the just."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"In this interesting passage we have a long step forward in the theologizing of the concept of justice. The contemplation of divine thi ngs, thought the Pytha goreans, instructed by Pythagoras himself, was useful for mankind. Th e reason was that we need a master, some ruling principle against which we do not dare to rise in rebe llion, and this is provided by the divinity. Our animal nature, he argued, is subjec t to hybris and is divers e and chaotic, subject to control by a variety of impulses, desires, and passions. There must be a power which by its superiority and its \"threatening eminence (epa nastasis)\" will introdu ce prudence and order into chaos. The Sphinx: Compare this notion of justice as a divi ne standard to the Egyptian concept of Maat which we discussed earlier. Here we fi nd evidence of a Form discussed virtually identically by first the Egyptians, then Pythagoras , then Plato. It is something higher than law, higher than human reason or learned wisdom — it is a \"god\" itself. The Chimaera: The actual characteristics of what are generally known as the \"Egyptian gods\" are far closer to the notion of Forms than they are to the later pantheons of pagan cultures such as Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia. A readi ng of Egyptian texts tran slated directly from the hieroglyphic will substantiate this. In only a very few legends [such as that of the death and rebirth of Osiris] do the gods assume human be havioral characteristics. In the vast bulk of the existing texts they are far more abstract, ha ving \"personalities\" that seem to overlap one another and symbolic attributes th at are difficult to identify in terms of purely human desires. Consider the following inscription from the tomb of Ramesses VI in this light, noticing the overlap between Truth ( Maat ) and Ra: 23 Adoration to Truth. Salutation to thee, this Eye of Ra through wh ich he lives every day! They who are behind the chapel fear her, the Brillia nt One, She who comes out from the head of him who made her. On the Head Serpent, w ho comes out in front of him! Thou art the brilliant eye who leads him, the word of j udgment of the One Whose Name is Hidden, the victorious one before the Ennead, Lady of Fear , great of respect, Truth, through whom Ra is glorified, she who appeases for him the Two Lands by her decrees, she who speaks to the gods and chases away evil, whose abomination is sin, she who appeases the hearts of the gods! Thou art the balance of the Lord of the Two Banks, whose face is beautiful when Ra comes to his Truth, being glorious through her. Those in Busiris praise him through her, litanies are sung to him by the gr eat gods while she adores the powers of the Two Chapels. He is glorious through her, more than the gods, in this her name of the Brilliant One. Thoth brought her and reckoned her, the Established One, the Brilliant, the Reckoned One, in this her name of the Ipet Serpent. He made her live as a Uraeus in this her name of Opener of the Ways, She who leads him on the ways of the horiz on, in this her name of Leader of Men. He erected her on his head in this her name of Very Great Crown. The Sphinx: A passage such as this is quite impossibl e to explain in term s of ordinary human conventions and value. It certainly bears scant resemblance to the light, allegorical adventures of later Mediterranean gods and goddesses. Yet to one versed in the language of the Egyptian priesthoods its meanings are quite clear. If Plato was an Egyptia n initiate, one can see why he would dismiss conventional means of reductioni st logic as a means for comprehending the Forms. The Chimaera: We have seen definite evidence of Pythagorean doctrine in the Platonic writings, and at the beginning of this discussion we recounted Pl ato's visit to the Pythagorean"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"centers in Italy and Africa from 399 to 387 BCE . But are there any grounds to suppose that Plato received direct initiation at th e hands of an Egyptian priesthood? The Sphinx: There are at least two indications that he did. First there is the following passage from the Prefaces of St. Jerome [circa 340-420 CE], placed by order of Popes Sixtus V [1585- 1590] and Clement VIII [1592-1605] as introduction to the Bible : 24 Pythagoras and Plato, those masters of the genius of Greece, visited as pilgrims seeking after knowledge and as humble disciples the sacerdot al college of the soothsayers at Memphis [Memphiticos vates], preferring to be initiated w ith respect to the ancient doctrines of that distant land, rather than impose on thei r country the yoke of their own ideas. The Chimaera: At the risk of belaboring the point, I again note that this passage was written prior to the final destruction of the Alexandrian library and [po ssibly] such references to the matter as it may have contained for scholars of the time. The Sphinx: For that matter, there may have been ot her sources available to St. Jerome which, for one reason or another, have not survived to the present day. Our second bit of evidence comes from Proclus, who states that Plato was initiated in Egypt over a thirteen-year period by the priests Patheneitb, Ochoaps, Sech tnouphis, and Etymon of Sebennithis. 25 The Chimaera: Again we can indulge in a little detective work. The names of the first three priests can be rendered precisely in hieroglyphics; that argue s for their authenticity. [The fourth can be rendered only approximately and thus is not conclusive.] The \"thirteen-year period\" happens to coincide w ith the normal training time for an Egyptian scribe [to achieve full fluency in the hieroglyphic language.] As for Sebennithis, it was the seat of the Egyptian government from 378 to 360 BCE under Nekht-Hor-heb I, first Pharaoh of the XXX Dynasty. Hence it would have been both relatively secure from a political standpoint and a logical place for Plato to seek Egyptian initiation. 26 The Sphinx: Talk about last minute timing! In 340 BCE , after more than four thousand years of native national rule, Egypt finally fell to a Pers ian army [which in turn fell to Alexander the Great in 332]. How sophisticated the Egyptia n initiatory systems remained under purely occupational governments is open to question — as would be the willingness of Egyptian priests to initiate foreigners under such circ umstances. Even Pythagoras' initiation many years earlier seems to have occurre d only after some arm-twisti ng by Amasis, himself a native Egyptian Pharaoh and thus an in itiate in his own right. A Pers ian or a Ptolemaic ruler would not have had such leverage over the native priesthoods, nor the knowledge to judge whether forced instruction was in fact genuine. After Pythagoras and Plato the link with the Egyptian priesthoods was broken. [This may very well account for the shar p distinctions between the Pythagorean/Platonic doctrines — with their apparent sophistication and seeming uniqueness — and the decidedly diluted commentaries (suc h as those of Aristotl e) which trailed along after them.] The Chimaera: Having come this far, what may we conclude concerning Plato's legacy? The Sphinx: He left two memorials: his writi ng and his Academy. The former contain discussions of Forms [or Egyptian \"gods,\" if you will!] on an initiatory level, although they are also useful as exercises in ordinary logic.

He may have failed to provide the Greece of his own day with the sort of enlightened government that he might have preferred, but he had seen Pythagorean domination of Sicily and Italy come to grief.

That, certainly, is testimony to his wisdom.

Epilogue Poor men, most admirable, most pitiable, With all their changes all their great Creeds change For Man, this alien in my family, Is alien most in this, to cherish creams And brood on visions of eternity, And build religions in his brooding brain And in the dark depths awe-full of his soul. My other children live their little lives, Are born and reach their prime and slowly fail, And all their little leves are self-fulfilled; They die and are no more, content with age And weary with infirmity. But Man Has fear and hope and phantasy and awe, And wistful yearnings and unsated loves, That strain beyond the limits of his life, And therefore Gods and Demons, Heaven and Hell: This Man, the admirable, the pitiable. Antiarchal Gnosticism Gnostic groups were not known, for the most pa rt, for their adherence to convention. They evolved in the genesis of the Roman Empire when radicals and rebels proliferated, when old cults were revived, and new cults and re ligions sprang up overnight. Among these unconventional cults, the antiarc hal Gnostics were the most irreverent and audacious. The term Gnostic means knowledge. In the context of th e Gnostics, it refers to information about the afterlife a nd the transmundane world. The Gnostics believed that through Gnosis one can transcend the world of darkness, the ph ysical, and ascend to the world of light. This view differed from the more orthodox religions in several ways. Primarily, most of the others relied on Faith to get them into heaven. This difference assured the Gnos tics that they would attract the more intelligent of the spiritual seekers, and the disdain of the conventional.

They were, and sti ll are, often lumped in with Christianity. This is always with the added label, \"heresy\", but they were actually ve ry syncretic. They did borrow from the teachings of Christ, but e qually from the Greeks, Egyptians, Indians, Israelites, and Persians. Theories as to their origins abound, but the most cogent one is that they derived from the heretical Jewish sects, like th e Essenes. This is based in pa rt on the geographical evidence of early Gnostic writings, and on the teachings them selves. One of the prominent themes in their writings is their hatred of the Old Testament, it's God, and it's laws, which was in accord with many radical Jewish offshoots of that time. W ithin this generally anarchistic philosophy, however, there arose specific groups that were so irreverent that the others seem the embodiment of submissiveness in comparison. They have been labeled many different ways; libertine, antinomian, licentious, and so on. I have chosen the term \"antiarchal\" instead, because it seems a more accurate term in describing what their philosophy really was. Libertine generally refers to sexual openness. Wh ile these groups often were far more liberal than the convention of the time, the reason was not to promote positive ideas regarding sex, or to pursue pleasure. It was to show their contempt for the lord of this world. Licentious means basically the same as libertine, so for similar reasons I reject it as well. Antinomian is more accurate. It means \"against law\", and it was first used by Johann Agricola, a collaborator of Martin Luther. It refe rs to the idea that Christians are saved from sin, and are therefore above the law. Many antinomi an Christians were anarchistic as well. By and large though, they accepted the right of \"proper\" authority to rule and examine their lives, and felt they would be found \"clean\" at the judgment. Ma ny other Gnostic groups went beyond this, and actively opposed the authority of the orthodox religious leaders and their God, as well as the dictates of the ruling elit e, so I will refer to them as \"antiarchal\". Antiarchy means simply \"against rule\", or \"against rulers\". It refers to groups of people who actively oppose any kind of ru ling authority, usually government al but also religious. The antiarchal Gnostics were against the biggest ruler of all, God not the beingness that they saw as the source of all real life, but the God who directly rules over this world, the God of the Old Testament. Gnostics differentiated between the two Gods by proposing that they are of two different realities. The reality of this world was seen as a place of suffering and spiritual darkness. The reality of a purely transcendent world which wa s seen as the realm of the pure spark of life, knowledge, love and light. This alien realm was seen as the true reality. The world of the dark lord, our physical world, was seen as a false reality. This philosophy was almost certain ly derived from the Mithraic Persians. They divided the heavens into two forces, one of light and good, the other of darkness and evil. The orthodox Christians also used this concept in their deba sement of the Greek God of nature, Pan, into a God of evil. Two prominent lines of thought developed among the Gnostics as a result of this dualistic philosophy. One was that contact with this wo rld was to be avoided whenever possible."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Groups with this belief became ascetic. They ignored sex, food (except the minimum), and any form of pleasure. They felt that physical contact would contamin ate them, and make it more difficult to transcend to the highest real ity after death. They claimed that the body was of this \"dark\" world, and therefore should be disdained. They represented the majority of Gnostic groups, though the degree of asceticism varied greatly from one group to another. The other group, the antiarchists, determined whic h \"acts\" were specifically forbidden by the Old Testament (the book of the dark God), and pur sued them with tenacity. By doing this they hoped to undermine to authority of the dark lord, and free themselves and others from the slavery of his laws. They claimed that Christ sanctified this activity when he said \"Do not resist evil.\" (Mat. 5:39) This view was often promoted by the most prominent Gnostics. Simon Magus is often considered to be the first Gnostic, as a contem porary of the apostles, and he appears in the New Testament. According to the records, he preached that laws were meant to enslave people, and therefore we should ignore them and live the way that we want. He quoted the bible to support this view: \"By his grace men are saved, not just by works\" (Ephesians 2:8). He was not antiarchal, but led the way. Some antiarchal Gnostics claimed that there were a limited number of sins, and that one could use them up through excess. This teaching has much in common with Tantric philosophy, and may have been influenced by it. It is certa in that Buddhism was known in the Greek world, and by the Gnostics; it's quite possible that othe r Eastern beliefs made the journey was well. There was Greek Skeptic and Sophist thought in the teachings of a few Gnostics, the belief that there is no absolute right or wrong only subjective mora lity. By being enlightened, they claimed, we can transcend the laws of the subj ective world, and can afford to ignore them. While this led the way to antiarchy, this isn't quite the same as active opposition. It was the role of certain Gnostic leaders to do that. One prominent Gnostic, Carpocrate s, taught some of the first an tiarchal concepts. He felt that \"through faith and love we are save d.\" (Gal 5:6) He claimed that Christ was raised with an understanding of Jewish laws, but grew to de spise them. This gave Christ great power; likewise, people who learn to despise these laws as well will receive great power. His followers were accused of practicing magical arts, incantations, charms and astral travel. These were common accusations of the Gnostic s. His son, Epiphanes, wrote a book called: \"On Righteousness\", which probably influenced many subsequent antiarchal Gnostics. In it he writes: \"God allows the sunlight to stream down e qually upon all creatures together, and gives both good and evil their portion of jus tice...\" \"For God made all thi ngs to be common property ... He thus showed 'righteousness' to be a unive rsal sharing along with equality\". \"Yet how absurd sound the words of the Lawgiver: 'Thou shalt not covet' and even more absurd the addition: 'What is thy neighbor's'. For he who gave desire to sustain the race now orders its suppression, though he takes it away from no ot her living creature. And with the words 'Thy neighbor's wife', he says something still mo re absurd, since he now transforms common property by compulsion into private possession.\" In his book, Epiphanes contends that the laws of the Demiurge (the dark, false God of the Old Testament) conflict with the true intent of the real God, and should be ignored. The Cainites,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"who derived their name from Cain and some of their teachings from Carpocrates, believed that the soul must pass through all experiences over the course of many lifetimes. This was based on Jesus saying, \"While you are on the road with your adversary, try to get rid of him so that he does not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the la w officer, and he send you to prison; verily I say unto you that you will not get out of there until you have paid back the last penny.\" (Luke 12:5859) The adversary wa s one of the dark angels who hands the soul over to another to be put into new body, which they considered to be the \"prison\". They believed that we will only be free when we have committed all sins, \"paid back the last penny\". We must sin to be saved. Antiarchal Gnostics honored the rebe ls of the bible; Cain, Esau, Judas, the Sodomites, and of course, the Serpent. There is an en tire school of Gnostic groups, called Ophites (Greek for serpent), who are categorized in the group based on their revere nce for the Serpent. He was seen as an incarnation of the redeemer, which they called the Logos , who brought divine knowledge to humankind. Some of these groups ar e clearly of old origins, probably going back to the Dionysian cults, E gyptian mysteries, and Oriental snake worshipping religions. A few Ophite groups were also antiarchal, like the Cainites and Nicolations, claiming that the Serpent should be revered because it defied th e Demiurge and was cursed. Like most Gnostics though, most Ophite groups were in the ascetic category. While the ascetic Gnostics avoided sex, most antiarchal Gnostics were very sexually active. Some considered sex to be the path to en lightenment. The Phibionites (meaning unknown) believed that by having sex 730 times, each time naming the ruler of a particular plane of existence, they could ascend to the highest pl ane, and become Christ. Other groups practiced rites very similar to Tantric and Taoist ones, holding back the orgasm until a state of ecstasy was achieved. The Borborians (meaning dirty) were known to eat seminal and menstrual fluids, because these were believed to contain the divine sparks of life. The Stratiotici (warlike) believed that the sexual fluids were the body of Christ, and the menstrual flui ds were the blood, which they also ate. They claimed their beliefs were suppor ted in the Bible, which states: \"I saw a tree which bears twelve fruits each year, and he said to me, 'This is the tree of life.'\" (Rev. 2:22) Like other Gnostic groups, the an tiarchists believed that it was a great evil to bring another soul into this world, so masturbation, sodom y, and sex with children was practiced. Most groups also pursued illicit sex for its antinomian aspects; the Levitici sect known for having only gay sex, the Antitactae practicing adu ltery. Many groups were accused of practicing incest. They were opposed to ma rriage, since it was sanctified by the Demiurge and could also lead to pregnancy. It was also considered bad form to claim exclusive rights of a woman (or man), and many groups were renown for th eir sexual openness and their orgies. The antiarchal Gnostics were also known to eat food sacrificed to idols, to watch bloodthirsty combat games, practice Naturism, and to co mpose their own Gospels. These were all considered heretical by the orthodox, and this led to further condemnations. Most of what we know of Gnostics is based on the writings of orthodox Christians. A number of Gnostic texts were uncovered in 1945 and have been translat ed, but very little antiarchal content is found in them. It could be that many of the charges made by the church are untrue; certainly some (like eating ch ildren) are very unlikely."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"There is currently a NeoGnostic revival going on . How closely modern Gnostics follow their predecessors is hard to tell. Th ere is no way we can be certa in what most Gnostics really believed. They were known for their secret inner teachings, which died with them, and without which it is impossible to accurately de cipher the symbolism and allegory in the few writings that have survived. We can only specu late. Whether the antiarchists were simply rebellious, or if they also had secret spiritual practices that involved antinomian activities is also not certain, but I feel th at they did. Their philosophy is well known, and it supports Dark Rites and heretical acts. While I doubt that ma ny of the modern Gnostic groups will take up the practices of the antiarchal ones, there is a value in studying thei r rites and beliefs and looking for the gems of truth that have survived the ages.

I sh all also demonstrate the existential authenticity of the Satanic pers pective on the Universe, an d man's relation to it. In order to do this, I will begin with a disc ussion of the Satanism of Anton LaVey, and its subsequent development into the Seti an philosophy of Michael A. Aquino. Before I begin, however, I think that it is important to dispense with a number of misconceptions concerning Satanic philosophy. By the term Satanism , I refer specifically to the philosophy of Anton LaVey, as set forth in his books The Satanic Bible , The Satanic Rituals , and The Compleat Witch , and as espoused by the Church of Satan. The first principle 2 of this philosophy is Indulgence 3 [Anton LaVey, The Satanic Bible ; Michael A. Aquino, The Church of Satan ]; and a great emphasis is placed upon the carnal aspect of man, which the Satanist feels to have been not only neglected by conventional religions but also actively repr essed, at the cost of inducing a great many neuroses and much unnecessary suffering. In a broader, more general sense, I apply the term to the Setian philosophy (whose Patron is the oldest semblance of the Pr ince of Darkness known to us, th e Egyptian Set, brother of the Sun god Horus, and symbolic of th e night and the lunar principle 4 ), the first principle of which is the Egyptian hieroglyph Xeper 5 , which means \"Become\" or \"Come into Being,\" and is symbolized by the Scarab Beetle. The Setian philosophy espoused by the Temple of Se t is highly eclectic an d highly existential. For this reason, the sacred and myth ical animals associated with the Neters 6 are interpreted in a highly metaphorical and allegorical manner. Perhaps it is also important to note the distinction between esoteric and exoteric interpretations of philosophical and Magical imagery. In othe r words, the Understanding of the Sages and Priests of ancient Initiatory soci eties -- those Initiated into the Inner Temple -- and that of the masses of followers who worshipped at the Outer temple 7 were at great variance.

I would also apply the term \"Satanism\" to the Thelemic 8 philosophy of the self-proclaimed Great Beast 666, Aleister Crowle y. Thus, Satanic are those Magi cal philosophies which exalt the individual Will, rather than seeking its dissolution through reunion with God, the rationale being that if one's individual e ssence is dispersed into that of God, the former ceases to exist as a separate entity. 9 By Satanism I do not refer to the nefarious activities of juvenile delinquents and psychopaths, and such activities as human or animal sacrif ices are looked upon with extreme disparagement by Satanists, Setians, and Thelemites. Moreove r, the objections which adherents to the Satanic and Setian philosophies br ing to bear against such activities do not merely stem from the fear of social reproach, but rather have their roots in the very core principles of these philosophies. As Anton LaVey points out in the section of the Satanic Bible satirically entitled On the Choice of a Human Sacrifice : There are sound and logical reasons why the Satanist could not perform such sacrifices. The purest form of carnal existence reposes in the bodies of anim als and children who have not grown old enough to deny themselves their natural desires. They can perceive things that the average adult human can never hope to. Therefore, the Satanist holds thes e beings in a sacred regard, knowing he can learn much from these natural magicians of the world. 10 Michael Aquino also goes to great pains to de monstrate why human and animal sacrifices are quite antithetical to the life-affi rming nature of the Setian philosophy. 11 With that, hopefully having allayed possible suspicions on the part of the reader that ritual murder is endorsed by adherents to Satanic philosophy, I will proceed to a discussion of the core principles underlying LaVeyan Satanism. Originally, the Church of Satan and its philo sophy arose as a reaction against what were perceived to be unreasonably restrictive mo ralisms. It was also a movement aimed at dealienating man's carnal aspect. Moreover, it qu estioned the widespread belief in the nobility and altruism of humanity as a whole, viewi ng this belief as naive and not born out by the realities of actual human existence and maintain ing that man -- or at least the common man -- is the most vicious of all beasts. 12 Conventional religious worship was seen as se lf delusion, as it was thought that the \"force which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care about the happiness or misery of flesh and blood creatures.\" 13 Thus the Christian con cept of a personal God was rejected, as was moral absolutism and the beli ef that God was the we ll-spring of morality. In the beginning, Satan was conceived of as a metaphor for hedonistic self-indulgence, free- spiritedness, and freedom of thought and action; and rituals and ceremonies performed in His name were seen as psychodramas aimed, by and large, at ridding the individual of irrational guilt fostered by his upbringing in the oppressive milieu of Christianity. 14 However, as time progressed, the Satanic philosophy was to take two quite distinctive directions: the first being a form of psychodramatic atheism in which Sata n was seen as merely an allegory for the carnal aspect of man and hedonistic self-indulge nce; the second viewing \"Satan\" as an actual sentient Being separate from the physical univers e and, further, as the very source of man's Being and his capacity for non-natural action. 15 "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Hence, there existed quite a dichotomy between these two approaches, the first endorsing a sort of naturalism and concerning itself exclusiv ely with the physical/material universe, the second exalting the alien, non-natural aspect of man as what set him apart from the beasts, and embodying a form of dualism in its postula tion of something beyond the purely physical. This second view was ultimately to be tr ansformed into the more expansive Setian philosophy. It is my contention that, while the Satanic ph ilosophy of Indulgence is intensely liberating and an integral element of the Setian philosophy, it, in itself, lacks direc tion and can ultimately become nihilistic. For this reason, I will deal primarily with the Setian philosophy, whose first principle is Xeper (Become). 16 Becoming is an open-ended concept, in the sense that there is no ultimate and absolute goal. And herein lies its vitality and existential authenticity. Consider for a moment one who fashions his entire existence around finite goals, e.g. the lovely two story, three-bedroom house in suburbia, with one and a half baths, 1.5 children, a lovely wife, and a two car garage containing tw o lovely, yet gas-efficient, automobiles. All such goals are fully attainable. Yet what resu lts when such goals, having served as an individual's raison d'etre , are realized? \"Mid life crisis,\" depression, a fe eling of emptiness. To paraphrase the words of one of Her Bak's teachers, to fulfill a desire is to annihilate it. Every time one fulfills a desire, a part of him dies. All life seeks to fulfill a purpose; and once that purpose has been exhausted, death results. 17 Therefore, the only effective measure against sp iritual death, which results from the feelings of emptiness that afflict such a large percentage of the worl d's population, and which is often the cause of physical death, 18 is a goal or ideal which is never fully attainable. Such a goal is Becoming. 19 The Right-hand Path vs. the Left : The term \"Right-hand path\" re fers to those religions and philosophies which look upon the \"ego,\" the Self or the individual, with disparagement, and seek conformity of thought and action, and even tual dissolution of the individual essence into that of God. 20 Such philosophies would in clude Christianity -- with a view to a past golden age of blissful innocence in the absence of the pain which self-consciousness produces, and a view to a future in Heaven, wherein such a state of innocence may be regained -- and Buddhism, with its promise of Nirvana. Many ar e the religions and philosophies of the Right- hand Path, and many are the other means which hu mans have devised in their attempts to extinguish this self-consciousness which so afflicts them. Drug abuse, alcoholism, and fanaticism of every kind have been employed in this capacity. However, whereas religions and phi losophies of the Right-hand Path seek to destroy this Self- consciousness and exalt peace, 21 those of the Left-hand Path exalt Self-awareness as the highest value. Accordingly, the Devil, the source of \"discord\" (translate: multiplicity), is understood by the Setian to be a friend and not an enemy. 22 Yet those whose highest value is not Self but rather peace will obviously not este em His Infernal Majest y so highly; and those in whose weakness the pain of consciousness is almost unbearable may be nothing short of virulent in their hatred for this Being. It will be said that the Chri stian perspective on the phenomenon of separate consciousness is being misrepresented; that Christianity has a personal concept of God and places supreme importance upon the person. To this I would re spond that, while Christian monotheism does place a great emphasis upon the person (as opposed to pantheism, for example) and imbues"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"him with a free will, exercise of this free will in contradiction to \"law of God\" is cause for extreme punishment. 23 However, as Anton LaVey points out in The Satanic Bible , one need not be a vicious and heinous individual to indulge in the \"seven deadly sins\": Satanism advocates indulging in each of these \"sins\" as they a ll lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. A Satanist knows there is nothing wrong with being greedy, as it only means that he wants more than he already has. Envy means to look with favour upon the possessions of others, and to be desirous of obtaining similar things for oneself. Envy and greed are the motivating forces of ambition -- and without ambition, very little of any importance would be accomplished. Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive. When you have over- eaten to the point of obesity, another sin -- pride -- will motivate you to regain your self- respect. Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering his body and protecting it from the elements is guilty of pride.... Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth, and if you lie in bed long enough, you may find yourself committing yet another sin -- lust. To have the faintest stirring of sexual desire is to be guilty of lust. In or der to ensure the propagation of humanity, nature made lust the second most powerful instinct, the first being self-preservation. The strongest instinct of every li ving thing is self-pre servation, which brings us to the last of the seven deadly sins -- anger. Is it not our ins tinct for self-preservati on that is aroused when someone harms us, when we become angry enoug h to protect ourselves from further attack? 24 In diametric opposition to St. Augustine's contenti on that pride is the root of all other sin, stands LaVey's concept of pride -- under the head ing of which he subsumes such concepts as self-love, self-esteem, and self-confidence -- as the conditio sine qua non 25 of the ability to love the other. 26 Thus, it is not those who take pride in themselves and possess a high degree of self-esteem , but rather those whose arrogance is the result of ove r-compensation for a lack of self-esteem, who are unable to treat others with consideration. Furthermore, Satanists and Setians are moral rela tivists, and their rationale for the adoption of this standpoint over that of moral absolutism w ill emerge from the following discussion of the Satanic and Setian inte rpretation of Cod. The question of the nature of God's existence : In the Setian philo sophy, the religious concept of God is conceived as roughly equivalent to the scie ntific concept of natural law. 27 Anthropomorphic and personal notio ns of God are rejected as internally inconsistent and illogical. When one conceives of God as loving or hating, dispensing rewards and punishments, one is imbuing God with human pa ssions, characteristics and dispositions; one is projecting on to God the imag e of an extremely powerful man. However, in doing so, one is limiting God, who is conceived by theologians as unlimited, 28 infinite, eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-beneficent."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"As far as the contention that God is all-good is concerned, the Satanist and the Setian would cite the abundance of \"natural evil\" (tornados, floods, earthquakes, etc. ) as tending to refute such a notion. Many theodicies have been se t forth by theologians in an attempt to demonstrate that God is, in fact, just. Thes e range all the way from the claim that God determines what is just, it therefore being absurd to refer to God as unjust, to more elaborate and cunning arguments, such as the tapestry analogy, i.e. the argument that the Universe 29 can be conceived in terms of a great tapestry. If we look at th e back of this tapestry, this argument holds, we see a large number of knot s and decide that the thing is rather unattractive. If, however, we turn it over and look at the front, we see a beautiful work of art. Similarly, when we focus our attention upon th e suffering and ugliness existing in the world, we are repulsed. However, this argument conte nds, were we to be in a position to view the Universe as a whole, as God is pr esumed to do, we would see how what, prima facie , appears to be hideous actually contributes to the beau ty of the whole. Both of these views serve to discount the value of the individual: in the former, he is no more than a plaything of God; in the latter, he is employed as a mere means to an end, as a tool , a thing , an it . (Furthermore, the conclusi ons of the theologian, who, through the subtle art of circumlocution, attempts to demonstrate the ju stice of God, are dogma tically predetermined, and therefore specious.) Conversely, Satanists and Setians are under no compulsion to re sort to mendacity in an attempt to justify the enormous suffering existing in the world. Rather, they view God as remote, intangible and amoral, unappro achable and undeserving of worship. 30 Therefore the concept of God cannot be the basis of ethics for the Setian. For is it not absurd to suppose that the ethical can be derived from the \"will\" of an impersonal and amoral being (or, more exactly, what is believed to be the will of such a being)? In its most elemental form, the Satanic/Setian concept of God is identified with the unity of unconscious mechanical existence 31 . The \"Fall\" of man vs. his Rise : If one conceives of the natu ral universe as comprised of unconscious mechanical existence, what of the individual Will, that concept so central to Satanic/Setian philosophy? The answer is that the Will is a non-natural phenomenon which is alien to the natural universe, and th us not wholly subject to its laws. 32 Arguably, for free Will or personal agency to exist, such a non-natural entity must exist; for if all of our behavior is determined exclusively by natural causality, it is the height of absurdity for us to consider ourselves as free. One might argue the position of some form of compatibilism, 33 holding that the determinist incorrectly posits a dichotomy of determinis m vs. non-determinism. The compatibilist holds that a behavior can be determined and yet freely- chosen; that the will is a function of nature and therefore determined; that there is, thus, no su ch thing as an undetermin ed action; that it is a lack of coercion which is the operative criterion of personal ag ency. Moreover, the compatibilist maintains that the determinist pos ition is counter-intuitiv e, and that we may postulate individual will on the basis of our phenomenological se nse of freedom and explain it without appeal to a non-natural entity."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"To this, I would respond as follo ws: True; there is a distinction to be drawn between coerced and non-coerced actions. But, if the actions ar e ultimately determined by nothing other than natural predisposition (e.g. ge netic factors, physiological de terminants, etc.) and social conditioning (i.e. programming), wherein lies man's freedom? There is nothing particularly unusual in the postulation of a dichotomy of Will and nature, inasmuch as Christianity posits a similar dichot omy (cf. the \"Fall of man\" and his subsequent estrangement from God), and inasmuch as Chri stianity has exerted an enormous influence upon much of the philosophical literature of th e Western tradition. However, what is unusual is the attitude which the Setian philo sophy takes toward this conflict. Adherents to religions and philosophies of the Ri ght-hand Path either: (a) evolve a naturalistic system of morality and attempt to resolve this conflict by means of conforming their actions to what they conceive as God's will or \"natural law;\" or (b) simply do not posit the existence of individual Will, decrying the Self as \"mer e illusion.\" However, ethical naturalism (the identification of the concepts \"good\" and \"n atural\") is rejected by the Setian philosophy. Instead, it is the alien, non-natura l aspect of man, seen as se tting him apart from the common beasts, which is exalted. In line with this exalta tion of the non-natural is an alterna tive interpretation of the Biblical myth of the \"Fall.\" There is a great deal of truth in the sayi ng \"Ignorance is bliss,\" hackneyed though this phrase might be. Thus, because consciousness produces pain, mass humanity looks back to a time of bestial, mindless oblivion with great longing. It is for this reason that the source of man's freedom, Self-awareness, and separateness has been slandered, painted red, and given horns and a pointed tail. 34 However, there are those who stand aloof from the many, and rather than slandering this Gift of freedom and Self-consciousness, seek to strengthen it and come to know the source of th eir Being. And it is those of the latter camp who are Setians and Black Magicians in the truest, fullest sense of these terms. Monotheism, \"neo-polytheism,\" a nd psyche-centric consciousness : Whereas God is generally conceived of as the cr eator of man, the Satanist/Setian holds that the concept of God as the absolute standard where by all things are judged is the creation of man. God is seen as the source of quasi-absolute, pseudo-objectiv e validation and valuation for those unable or unwilling to assume the existentia l responsibility for self-valid ation of their own lives. The Satanist/Setian takes a highly relati vistic view of the Universe, r ealizing that much of what is conceived as \"objective reality\" is more accurate ly understood as part of a prevailing local consensus reality. (And it is interesting to note that, while there are a great many consensus realities out there, most of which falsely represent themselves as \" objective reality,\" \"the tr uth,\" \"fact,\" etc., there is, presumably, only one objective universe.) The goal of the Satanic and Setian philosophies is not worship of God, but rather mastery by the individual over his own subjective universe, th e attainment of a divine state of Being. This is what I meant by the term \"neo-polytheism.\" By assuming the role traditionally afforded to the monotheistic God, through validation of his own existence, the Satanist or Setian becomes a god in his own right. The Setian philosophy is psyche-centric as oppos ed to monotheocentric. Rather than placing God at the centre of his subjective universe, a nd conceiving the value of individual beings and"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"their actions in terms of the concept \"God's Will, \" the Setian, taking the view that reality is, by and large, a subjective construct, places hi mself at the centre of his own subjective universe, and he determines th rough the process of a ttribution the value of all that exists therein. Moreover, he determines the value of th e objective universe itself. For, inasmuch as the value of inanimate matter and insensate energy is conceived as extrinsic , as an attribution, rather than something intrinsic to these things themselves , the universe would possess no value in the absence of beings possessed of the capacity for reflective consciousness. There will be those who will maintain that a pu rely materialistic universe comprised of matter and energy alone, in which no sentient beings ex isted, would possess a certain intrinsic value; that non-sentient things possess a value in and of themselves completely independent of any form of attribution on the part of conscious be ings. However, what sort of value would this be? Would it not be far removed from what is normally meant by the term \"value?\" For is not the value of all things -- or at least the valu es which are significant in the lives of human beings -- determined: (a) by their usefulness to se ntient beings, (b) the aesthetic pleasure they give to sentient beings, and (c) their relation to the subjective moral and ethical constructs of such beings? In keeping with the highly relativistic, subject ive, and perspectival out look of the Satanic and Setian philosophies is an emphasis upon what Nietzsche termed \"master morality\" over \"slave morality.\" Hence the Satanist or Setian does what he perceives to be ethical not because he fears punishment in the nether world for his \"t ransgressions,\" but because he realizes that certain types of actions are li fe-affirming, while others are lif e-stultifying. Thus, in Willing the continuance and enhancement of life, he Wills a certain a certain type of ethic. Hence he has come to a rational understanding of the necessity for certain ethical standards. However, Satanists and Setians are not egalitarian in their outlook, and do not concur with the notion that \"all men are created equal,\" and th erefore realize the important function which traditional religions and moralities serve in ke eping the masses -- shown by their behavior to be little more than dangerous beasts, beha ving primarily on an unconscious level -- under control. For, when billions of unconscious robots begin bumping into one another, destruction (and mass carnage) inevitably re sult. Hence, if such peopl e cannot understand the rational necessity for certain ethical standards, perhaps it is necessary to appeal to them on a more primitive level, employing what Plato referred to as \"sacred lies.\" Faith vs. doubt : Whereas adherents to many religious -- and even secular philosophies -- make a virtue of blind faith and consider it to be an adequate substitute for rational substantiation of thei r hypotheses (or perhaps claim that the greater questions are not susceptible of rational inquiry), blind faith is looked upon with disparagement by Satanists and Setians. On this subject, Anton LaVey says : \"He who is slow to believe anything and everything is of great understanding, for belief in one false principle is the beginning of all unwisdom.\" Elsewhere, he writes: \"Without th at wonderful element of doubt, the doorway through which truth passes would be shut tig ht, impervious to the most strenuous poundings of a thousand Lucifers.\" Michael A. Aquino writes: [Setians] have confidence in the capacity of higher human intelligence to reach beyond the frontiers of scientific (i.e. strictly-objective universe) knowledge to at least some aspects of the Universe without having to fall back on ir rational fantasy or faith. Moreover, they consider this quest to be an important, even cruc ial one, as they feel that the ultimate, essential"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"reason behind the existence of mankind -- or at least a certain, unique quality in mankind -- is to be found through such exploration. However, it is important to realize that the Setian philos ophy is not based upon pure logical positivism, though an attempt to apply this in it s proper place is made, with the realization that such an approach is not sufficient to facilitate an adequate Understanding of the Universe. As was said earlier, the Setian philosophy does not discount the value of the subjective universe, as would a pure logical positivist. Furthermore, in addition to the intellectual faculties, or what might be termed \"the Intelligence of the Head,\" the Setian recognizes the existence of an intuitive form of knowing, or \"the Inte lligence of the Heart,\" the objects of which are apprehended thr ough the Greater Black Magical Working. The knowledge arising out of such Workings is hi ghly phenomenological in that it involves the intuition of essences by means of free imaginative variation. The Setian Greater Black Magical Working is to be distinguished from conventional religious worship in that the Setian does not identify Set with God, but Understands Him to be a finite Being who is engaged in a constant process of Becoming. Nor does the Setian abase himself before this Being, but instead sees Him as a Teacher. Ultimately, though, it is the Setian who must apply his knowledge. The Prince of Dar kness is no redeemer; rather, every individual Setian is his own redeemer. Blind faith is not a factor here, for it is expe cted that one will accept a principle only after careful consideration and on the basis of the evidence which one has at his disposal. (In fact, there are those Satanists and Setians by whom the Prince of Darkne ss is understood in an allegorical context.) However, the Setian philosophy is based upon certain premises for which there is no absolute proof. For example, th e existence of free will cannot be known with objective certainty; and a suffi ciently crafty philosopher will always be able to develop arguments to the contrary. Yet such arguments themselves rest upon certain assumptions. Hence, it seems apparent that the adoption of certain assumptions is inescapable; that all theories, even those of the natural scientist, depend, ultimately, upon assumptions. Therefore, to be strictly accurate, no man is without faith. However, there are degrees of faith; and that of the individual who has carefully examined a pr oblem from as many angles as possible before coming to his conclusion is quite far remove d from that of the fanatic who, not having adequately examined the question at hand, resolves it on the basis of blind faith. Furthermore, having dispensed with the Cartesia n criterion for knowledge (that is, objective certitude), if one adopts a more existential ep istemology, and judge as existentially authentic those philosophies and religions which are life-affirming rather than life-denying, the existential authenticity of the Setian philo sophy is more than apparent. For the Setian philosophy places a supreme value upon individual ex istence, affirming that existence, rather than denying it by adopting as its highest value something external to it, and placing ethical responsibility and the responsibility fo r self-validation upon the individual.

The ancient Greek concept of Logos (Wor d, or fundamental rational principle in accordance with which the Universe is made intelligible; language and that which underpins language) is central to the Setian ph ilosophy. In this connexion, perhaps it is interesting to note Martin Heidegger's concep t of language as the house of the truth of Being, as well as his notion of man's pr oper dwelling within this house of Being, vis a vis the Aristotelian notion of man as a zoon logon ekhon (translated into the Latin as animal rationale , meaning \"rational animal;\" literally, th e Greek translates into English as \"a living thing -- or animal -- havi ng logos\") [Martin Heidegger, Letter on Humanism ]. Thus it is in man's relation to Logos that his divine and transcendent Essence is revealed. 3.

[ The indispensable condition ] Pride, understood in the sens e of self-love, self-esteem, etc., is not only a necessary precondition of the ability to love others, but also essential to one's emotional well-being. A great deal of pathological and neur otic behavior is attributable to a lack of this sort of pride. 26. LaVey, The Satanic Bible 27. Aquino, The Crystal Tablet 28. In this connexion, I would submit the followi ng: (a) We, being finite, are hardly in a position to speculate concerning th e nature of a hypothetical in finite being. (b) To echo an argument of the Enlightenme nt Rationalist Benedict De Spinoza, passions, such as love and hatred for example, are particular finite modes of thought, whereas it logically follows that God, if posited as an unlimited being, has thought itself as an attribute. Therefore, a God which is posited as infi nite and unlimited and yet motivated by the same sorts of passions which determine th e actions of human beings is a logical contradiction. 29. The Universe (with a capital 'U') is define d as the totality of existence, both known and unknown by humanity [Aquino, The Crystal Tablet , p. 3]. The Universe is comprised of the objective universe and a multiplicity of subjective universes. The objective universe is defined as the totality of inanimate matter and inse nsate energy; and, generally speaking, the terms material, physical, and na tural universe are r oughly interchangeable with the term objective univers e. A subjective universe is comprised of the collective phenomena of the individual mind. Perception, imagination, thought, Will, memory, etc., are all constituents of a subj ective universe. The subjective universe is non-physical and possessed of the capacity for non-natural action. 30. LaVey,The Satanic Bible 31. Aquino, The Crystal Tablet 32.

Three of the foremost positions concerning the question of personal agency, also known as the problem of free will vs. determinism, are non-determinism, determinism and compatibilism. Non-determinism posits the existence of individual Will, and holds that, when one is acting freely, his behavior is motivated by so mething other than external causal forces, such as genetic predisposition; that the Will is something more than, say, the libido of Freud, which is merely an instinctual drive. There is something to be said for the non-de terminist position, insofar as we conceive of the human person as being free in a manner th at the mere beasts are not. For, if one conceives of the human \"will\" as nothing more than a collection of instinctual drives not unlike those which determine the behavior of beasts, does it not follo w logically that he must also either: (a) attribute personal agency to animals; or (b) postulate that man is, in fact, not possessed of the cap acity for personal agency? However, both (a) and (b) are quite inconsiste nt with our normal thinking about personal agency. Inasmuch as freedom entails responsib ility, if we accept (a ) as true, should we not be compelled by the force of logical deduc tion to consider animals as moral agents (which we do not)? If we accept alternative (b), should we be not be forced to abrogate from man any sort of ethical responsibility for the state of his life a nd his world? Both of these logical consequences woul d appear to me to be quite intolerable. Thus I would want to reject the view that individual Will is reducible to mere instinct. The determinist position holds that individual W ill is merely an illusion; that all of his actions are determined by external forces which lie beyond his control. Thus the individual is lost in such a view, being reduced to a numbe r of links of a great causal chain. The compatibilist position is perhaps the most pragmatic of the three, holding that personal agency and determinism are not incompa tible; that it is apparent that our actions are determined, but that we can still act freely. I think that the rationale be hind this position will emerge from the following scenario: When deciding whether or not a person w ho has broken the law has done so freely, a furor does not conjecture that the person may be reducible to a mere cog in the cosmic machinery, but rather seeks to ascertain wh ether the person, in breaking the law, was acting under some form of coercion or compulsion. (e.g. the person may have been forced at gunpoint to perpetrate the said in fraction of the law, in which case he would probably -- depending, of course , upon the specific details of the said crime -- not be considered to have acted freely, and would, th erefore, probably not be held responsible.) 34. Aquino, Temple of Set Informational Letter 35. LaVey, The Satanic Bible 36. Satanists and Setians are not atheists; however, their concep t of God bears very little resemblance to popular interpretations of God. The Satanic and Setian philosophies approach theology on a rational level, whereas much of conventiona l religiosity amounts to nothing more than the fervor of the pa ssions completely unbound by any semblance of reason. 37. A consensus reality is a collection of be liefs concerning the nature of the objective"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"universe, or a certain porti on thereof, endorsed and reinfo rced by members of a society [Robert Anton Wilson, Prometheus Rising ]. 38. Such worship is understood by Satanists and Se tians to be a subjugation of the individual Will to something outside of itself, a denial of the worth of Self and a refusal to assume the existential responsibility for self-validation. 39. There is an important distinction to be dr awn between the concepts of psyche-centric consciousness and egocentricity. Whereas the la tter is characteristic of small children, and therefore does not presuppose that any gr eat degree of self-actualization has been achieved, the former arises out of a ca reful consideration of the phenomena of experience. As Immanuel Kant noted, only the phenomena of experience are accessible to us; and we are unable to obtain direct evid ence of objects existing within the realm of the noumenal or \"the thing in itself.\" Furthe rmore, as Robert Anton Wilson notes in his Prometheus Rising , \"What the thinker thinks, the prove r proves.\" Therefore, insofar as one concurs with these theories , the idea of reality as iden tifiable with something which exists outside of ourselves becomes somewhat ridiculous. For what we term \"reality\" is the creation of our mind. Moreover, in a universe in which sen tient beings did not exist, there would be no question of \"real vs. unreal.\" Perhaps, however, the most crucial distincti on to be drawn between these two concepts is that the former recognizes the existence of other subjective univers es, whereas the latter does not. 40. I suppose that the balance between the centrip etal and centrifugal forces which keeps the planets of this solar system in their orbit ha s a certain value in its utility; but, in the absence of sentient beings, such utility has no existential value. 41. For example, how could a sunset be beautiful in the absence of someone to perceive and appreciate it? 42. as Ouspensky observed in his Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution 43.

An individual in whom there exists a harmony between all form s of knowing (rational, empirical, intuitive/phenomenological, etc.) is said to be possessed of Understanding (with a capital \"U\"). Moreover, such an U nderstanding discounts ne ither the subjective nor the objective elements of a question [Aquino, The Crystal Tablet ]. 47. Aquino, The Crystal Tablet 48. For a more complete discussion of these tw o concepts, see Isha Schwaller De Lubicz's Her Bak -- Egyptian Initiate . 49. Magic : In the section of the Satanic Bible entitled The Theory and Practice of Satanic Magic [p. 110], Anton LaVey defines magic genera lly as \"the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, wh ich would, using normally accepted methods, but unchangeable.\" Black Magic : Setian Black Magic can be divided in to two categories: Lesser and Greater Black Magic. \"Lesser Black Magic is the influe ncing of beings, processes, or objects in the objective universe by the application of obscure physical or behavioral laws.\" [Aquino, The Crystal Tablet , p. 211] Lesser Black Magic wo uld include everything from"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"stage magic to the application of cosmetics to Machiavellian power politics. \"Greater Black Magic is the causing of change to o ccur in the subjective universe in accordance with the Will. This change in the subj ective universe will cause a similar and proportionate change in the objec tive universe.\" [Crystal Tablet , p. 28] Working : A ritual or ceremony; also -- and perhap s more importantly -- \"an exploration of essence\" [Aquino, The Church of Satan ], the process whereby the Higher Self or spiritual Being of the Initiate is unmasked and a knowledge of Set, the source of this Being, is manifested. 50. LaVey, The Satanic Bible , page 33 51. The determinist hypothesis (i.e. the contention that individual Will or creative agency in fact does not exist; that \"actions\" are merely events determined according to the laws of natural causality) presupposes a causal relation between events. Yet, the existence of the very cause and effect relationship cannot be prov ed absolutely, being suspect in that it is inferred a posteriori (i.e. from induction based upon em pirical observation). For: (a) the evidence of the senses is susp ect; and (b) when one resorts to induction, there is always the danger that one will fall into the logical fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc (\"after this, therefore because of this\"); that is, the fallacy of assuming that, because event B follows event A, event B is necessarily caused by event A. However, should one attempt to limit himself to a priori reasoning (or purely logical deduction), one may find himself in a position in which he may be able to know that all bachelors are unmarried, and yet not be able to argue successfully for the existence of the material universe or that of other minds. 52. In the context of Becoming, all things ar e in flux -- even truth and reality; for the Magician transcends mere philosophy, or the art and science of coming to understand that which is , by bringing something new into existence (cf. the famous statement of the Miltonic Satan in Paradise Lost , \"The Mind is its own place, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell or a Hell of Heaven\"). 53. Inasmuch as the function of a religion is understood to be the imbui ng of man's existence with significance, the religious validity of the open-ended principle of Becoming -- a quest which is never completed, and thus c onstantly impels the Setian forward -- is undeniable.

To facilitate the provision of religious activ ities which serve the needs of persons of certain faiths not otherwise represented by military chaplains and others; 2. To define the specific requirements and pr actices in such a way as to enable commanders at all levels to make effectiv e personnel decisions in those instances when religious beliefs and practices are cl aimed to be in conflict with military directives and practices; and 3. To provide the specific information about each group in a form which has maximum utility for military purposes, yet is approved as normative or at least acceptable by the leaders of those vari ous groups under study. The Handbook is written as a guide for chapla ins and, where appropriate, for commanders. Although it accurately reflects the positions of each group in general, chaplains are urged to consider the religious needs of each member individually. The specific purposes of the Handbook also serve to limit the amount of information provided on each group. Thus, while the information provi ded is accurate (in most instances approved by authorities from the individua l groups themselves), it is by no means comprehensive. Lay persons, particularly, are cautioned that the Handbook is not a guide to religion, and that consideration of the implications of adopting a particular fait h or belief system is best accomplished under the careful guidance of a chaplain or other religious leader. This Handbook is a thorough revision of the firs t edition of Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains . It was originally published in 1979, and a supplement was issued in 1980. The development of this new edition of the Handbook was accomplished in a series of steps, th e first of which was the selection of the groups to be included. Beginning with the list of groups in the original edition, those which"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"had dissolved were eliminated. From the po ssible 1,500 groups to be included, additional groups were chosen on the basis of the same cr iteria as the original selection, i.e. after answering three specific questions: 1. Given the size of the group and the nature of assignments of Army Chaplains, is it likely that members of the group will be found on military installations where no chaplain of that particular faith or of a related faith is stationed? 2. Is the group known to the Office of the Ch ief of Chaplains as one about which questions have been previously raised by existing chaplains or commanders? 3. Is the nature of the group such that questi ons about it may be raised by chaplains or commanders in the near future? While the answers to these questions may we ll encompass many groups not covered in the Handbook, selection of the groups included represen ts an attempt to incorporate the largest possible percentage of such groups which might be addressed in a single Handbook. The material presented in the Handbook was obtai ned through an extensive research effort. Pertinent literature was identified and surv eyed, various coordina ting bodies related to military chaplains were consulted, and open-ended interviews were conducted with active members of the various groups. Based on this res earch, draft descriptions of each group were developed and prepared for validation. The process of validating the information include d a review of the draf t descriptions with officials of the groups. Where po ssible, approval of the final draft version was obtained from a church or group official. The final description was then comp leted, based on the information received from these officials in response to the final draft descriptions. The Handbook includes 51 different group descriptions, divided into seven categories. The categories are: • Christian Heritage Groups • Indian Heritage Groups • Islamic Heritage Groups • Japanese Heritage Groups • Jewish Groups • Sikh/Sant Mat Groups • Other Groups Each section has a brief introductory segm ent which provides general comments on the category. The 51 different groups are then divide d according to the most appropriate category. The Handbook follows the same format for each group in terms of specific questions raised. In total 16 different questions were addre ssed to each organization. The questions were altered somewhat from the previous edition in order to elicit in a succinct form the information a chaplain was most likely to need: • Address: • Other names by which known: • Current leader: • Membership:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"• Historical roots: • Basic teachings and belief: • Practices and behavioral standards: • Organizational structure: • Ministerial leadership: • Worship: • Dietary standards: • Funeral and burial requirements: • Medical treatment: • Other considerations: (the other considera tions include delineation of any beliefs or practices likely to conflict with military orders, group attitudes toward pacifism, and methods of recruitment by the group.) • General source books: • For more information: Throughout the text, words which are defined in the Glossary of Terms appear in italics. Where questions arise about the various gr oups which are not addressed in the Handbook, such questions may be raised directly with th e groups themselves, if necessary, by writing or calling the group headquarters. Most groups have designated a specific contact person whose name, address, and phone number are given under the \"For more information\" heading at the end of each entry. Supplementary Resources There are over 1,500 different re ligious bodies currently func tioning in the United States. New ones are constantly appearing. More than ha lf of these groups are traditional Christian denominations which together command the allegiance of the majority of America's religious believers. The remaining groups, however, re present the broad spectrum of the world's religions, many of which have been transplanted to the United States in the last century, many in the last generation. A few have been create d in the twentieth cent ury. All present trends indicate that the number of new religious groups will continue to increase at a steady pace. The emergence of such divergent religious life in some strength challenges both secular and religious leaders to deal with a much more complex situation. It calls for new levels of understanding in dealing with si tuations in which the religious convictions of an individual will often not just offer some divergence but will radically conflict with the faith perspective of the chaplain and/or commanding officer. Obviously, with so many possibilities, only some of the larger and more typical different religious groups could be incl uded in the Handbook. In many cases th e chaplain is as likely to encounter members of another similar group as the one chosen to typify a set of groups. There are, for example, a number of different Zen B uddhist groups, the Zen Center of Rochester and its affiliated centers being but one example. There are any nu mber of Wiccan covens not affiliated with the Gardnerians, th e largest of the coven networks. Fortunately there are seven aut horitative resources which provide regularly updated material on a wide variety of religious groups which can be used to extend the value of and supplement the material in this Handbook. They include:"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"• Hill, Samuel (Ed.), Handbook of Denominations in the U.S. . Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, annual edition. • Melton, J.

A Note About Cults During the 1970s, the term \"cult\" came into popular use. While having a specific social science reference, as employed in popular disc ourse, it has come to have an extremely derogatory connotation. It has been used as a label to stigmatize various religious groups, some of which are treated below. Also in terms of its popular us age, there is li ttle agreement over the meaning of the term or specifically what characteristics qualify a particular religious group to be so labeled. It is also the case that in dea ling with a problem or a pastoral situation which concerns an individual member of such a group, such terms as \"cult\" have little use in reaching an acceptable solution. Hence the term is not used in the Handbook and chaplains are cautioned in its use in their da y-to-day professi onal activities. This Handbook could not have been prepared wi thout the cooperation an d assistance of many individuals. Most important we re the many representatives of the various religious groups who took the time to read and correct the earlier drafts of the various entries. The American Religions Collection at the University of Calif ornia, Santa Barbara served as the back-up resource file for the Handbook. It is currently the most comprehensive collection on American religious bodies in existence, and we thank th e library staff for its s upport. Finally, we thank the staff of the Institute for th e Study of American Religion and the Santa Barbara Centre for Humanistic Studies who a ssisted the authors in co mpiling and checking the Handbook, including Matthew Roberts, Aidan A. Kelly, and Suzette P. Melton. Introduction: \"Other\" Groups The groups considered in this section manifest the wide variety of reli gious options available in the U.S. They draw upon several distinct re ligious impulses, each with a long heritage. Metaphysical Groups One can trace within the Western religion an alternative tradition wh ich might be termed mystical, Platonic, or idealistic. This tradition emerged in force in the nineteenth century in philosophical idealism which in America became visible in the movement called Transcendentalism. What has been termed th e Metaphysical movements in America represent a blossoming of this old altern ative tradition in the atmosphe re of religious freedom and relative secularity of nineteenth century America. The th ree main branches of metaphysical religion emerged in the nineteenth century as Spiritualism, Theosophy, and New Thought."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Each affirmed the reality of a spiritual reality of which the vi sible material world was but a pale reflection. Spiritualism was built around the belief in the po ssibility of contacting the spiritual world, specifically the spirits of the departed, through the use of the talents of very special people called mediums. Spiritualism became a fad in the 1850s and then settled into a quieter existence as a new religious movement. The Univ ersal Church of the Ma ster described below is a typical Sp iritualist group. Theosophy grew out of spiritualism but direct ed its contact to a more evolved group of spiritual being who comprise what was thought of as the Spiritual Hierarchy of the cosmos. These masters spoke to the leaders of the Th eosophical Society, which became the source of a number of groups as new claims to contact with the Masters were put forth. The \"I AM\" Religious Activity and the Church Universal and Triumphant are two contemporary groups which have claimed contact with the Spiritu al Hierarchy through th eir founder/leaders. New Thought grew directly out of Christia n Science. Christian Science had asked the question of healing within the context of an idealist philosophical framework. New Thought, begun by one of Mary Baker Eddy's students, E mma Curtis Hopkins, di ffered from Christian Science at first over organizational disputes, but has during the twentieth century developed in various new perspectives whic h have taken it some distan ce from Christian Science. The United Church of Religious Science is one form of New Thought (as is the Unity School of Christianity considered in the first section of this manual). Psychic Groups From ancient times people have claimed powe rs of mind and spirit far surpassing those recognized by modern science. In years pa st these phenomena (e.g. spiritual healing, telepathy, clairvoyance, mind over matter) were termed \"supernatural\"; they are now known as \"psychic\" and studi ed by scientists. The growth of psychic practitioners led to th e development of psychical research. The British Society for Psychical Research was establishe d in 1880, and the American Society in 1882. In studying psychic phenomena, Dr. Rhine of Duke Un iversity coined the term \"extra-sensory perception (ESP)\" and helped make \"parapsych ology\" a discipline of study. The growth of parapsychology, including its me mbership in the American A ssociation for the Advancement of Science, provided a dynamic base upon which psychic groups could build. Religious groups with an essential element of belief and practice in psychic phenomena, including the Church of Scientology and the Fo undation Faith of the Mi llennium, continue the older metaphysical tradition and cannot be shar ply distinguished from the older metaphysical groups. In general they believe in the reality of the phenomena studied by parapsychologists. They usually offer members various ways to develop their powers, and some have members with special abilities which can be used by individuals to aid in dealing with personal problems. There are several hundred psychica lly-oriented bodies in the U. S. The two considered here grow out of this general background, and ar e not directly relate d to other bodies."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Magick Magick (not \"magic,\" which is considered a stage performer's art a nd not a religion) groups have experienced considerable growth sin ce the 1960s. These groups are distinguished by their use of occult practices (astrology and divi nation) and magick (the ability to willfully change the world by manipulating the cosmic forces). While like the psychic dimension, magick is as old as known history. Its contem porary revival, however, began in the early 1900s. The most popular form of magical religion, Neo- Paganism, is a nature-oriented religion based on the worship of male-female polarity, the observance of the agricultural seasons, and magick. Worship of the male-female aspects of na ture usually is expresse d as allegiance to the Horned God and the Great Mother Goddess. R itual follows the movement of the sun and moon. Neo-Pagans see themselves as reviving th e pre-Christian religion of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, and manife st as Norse, Druid, or Egyptian in format. By far the Wiccans compose the largest segment of the ne o-Pagan community. Wicca or Witchcraft is derived from the ancient Paganism practiced in Western Europe, especially the British Isles. Magick, an essential element in modern Wicca, seeks mastery of all the cosmic forces believed to control the world. Witches believe in the ancient principal of \"as above, so below\" and in their worship seek to create a microcos m, a magical image of the whole. The universe is generally viewed as a sphere. The magical circle, drawn at the be ginning of all magical rituals, is the outline of the microcosm intersecting the floor. Witchcraft had grown slowly until the repeal of the last of England's anti-witchcraft laws in the 1950s. Growth accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s. There are no less than thirty different Wicca groups and hundreds of independent covens functioning in the United States. The Gardnerians are one of several modern Wicca gr oups. They trace their history to Gerald B. Gardner, who initiated the current Wiccan re vival. However, most Wiccans now follow an eclectic practice which values creativity and is constantly changing and altering ritual while remaining within the basic nature Goddess orientation. During the 1980s many Neo-Pagans and Wiccans joined the Armed Forces. Recently they have formed a network to assist in their relating to the military. The network may be contacted through its newsletter , Pagan Military Newsletter , 829 Lynnhaven Parkway, Virginia Beach, VA 23452. Secrecy is a major element of the existence of both Witchcraft a nd Satanism (discussed below). Secrecy is protective ( known members often lose their j obs, friends or status), and serves to guard the sacred mysteries of the group. Satanism Often confused with Neo-Paganism and Wicca, Satanism is the worship of Satan (also known as Baphomet or Lucifer). Classical Satani sm, often involving \"black masses\", human sacrifice, and other sacrilegious or illegal acts, is now rare. Modern Satanism is based on both the knowledge of ritual magick and the \"anti-es tablishment\" mood of the 1960s. It is related to classical Satanism more in image than subs tance, and generally focuses on \"rational self- interest with ritualisti c trappings\". Modern Satanism began with the Church of Satan, founded"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"by Anton LaVey in 1966. From it, in the 1970s, several groups emerged and quickly disappeared. The Temple of Set is the only subs tantive offshoot to survive into the 1980s. Modern Satanists have found it relevant to di stinguish themselves from what is termed contemporary devil-worship. By Devil-worship is meant the various informal activities which have appeared in the 1980s around teenage use of Satanic symbols, killin gs of serial killers professing to have been worshipping the Dev il, and various reports of \"Satanic\" crime. Modern Satanists (i.e. the Church of Satan a nd Temple of Set) profess a pro-life philosophy and do not condone illegal action by people a ffiliated with thos e organizations. Individually Distinctive Groups Within the variety of American religion are a number of groups which are highly individual in nature. That is, while their or igins can often be traced to a ny number of the major world religions, they have developed beliefs, systems, or structures which are considerably different from those traditions. Several of the groups discussed in this section fa ll within this general framework: the Baha'i Faith, the Native American Church, and the Universal Life Church. Baha'i is a major new faith built on the revelations given to several Persian mystics of the l9th century. While growing on an Islamic base, it has moved to a more universal outlook. The Native American Church is one of many that uses psychedelic substances as a visionary aid and sacramental element. They are distinct ive in being both the oldest and the only one with government sanction to use the designated drugs. The Universal Life Church represents a res ponse to the religious freedom in America by individuals with a strong independent strain in their religious thought. The Universal Life Church has spawned a num ber of similar church bodies including the Crown of Life Fellowship, the Life Science Church, the Calvary Grace Church and the Brotherhood of Peace and Tranquility. Rastafarian are a new religion developed in Jamaica in the early twentieth century and imported to America in recent decades. It draw s on themes familiar from Black Judaism and Black Islam, but is distinct from both. Finally, Vajradhatu is a Buddhist group, but out of a Tibetan rath er than a Japanese tradition. Temple of Set Address: Post Office Box 470307 San Francisco, CA 94147 Other names by which known: Within this religion its principles are termed \"Setian\", and individual affiliates are termed \"Setians\". As the original god Set was later caricatured as the \"Satan\" of"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Judaeo-Christianity, Christians often interp ret this religion as \"Satanism\" and its affiliates as \"Satanists\". Setians accept such labels only to the extent that the Christian Satan represents certain qua lities of individualism and i ndependence. Setians reject any interpretation of Satanism that glorifies or promotes evil or destructiveness. Leadership: Michael A. Aquino, High Priest of Set Membership: Not published. Historical Origins: Together with the Priesthood of Horus, the original Priesthood of Set was the most ancient of the Egyptia n religious orders, dating (by su rviving predynastic images of Set) to at least 3200 BCE and by the Egyptia ns' own astronomically-based records to approximately 5000 BCE. The Setian religion played a prominent role in Egyptian society throughout its development, to incl ude being the state religion of the XIX-XX dynasties of the New Empire. It appears to have been eclipsed approximately 1000 BCE. Thereafter what may be termed the \"Satanic tradition\" survived in successive Western civilizations in the form of philosophies and/or god-figures focusing on \"awareness and activity beyond the natura l order\". Such range from the Prometheus of the Hellenes and the Lucifer of Christianity to the individualistic philosophies of Pythagoras, Plato, and Nietzsche. The Roma ntic movement of the 1800s dramatized the Christian Devil as a heroic, Miltonian symbol, thus setting the stage for the eventual formation of the Church of Satan in 1966. The Temple of Set was founded in 1975 by th e international Priesthood of the Church of Satan to supersede th at institution (whose founder, Anton LaVey, had announced intentions to commercialize it). Simulta neously the anti-Christian mythology and orientation of the Church of Satan were disc arded in favor of the completely distinct character of the original Egyptian Prie sthood of Set. The Temple of Set was incorporated as a non-profit church in California in 1975, and qualified for U.S. federal and state tax- exempt status that same year. Basic Beliefs: The Temple considers itself to be consecrat ed by and dedicated to Set, originally an ancient Egyptian deity. One rival cult, that of Osiris -- whose myths were erroneously assumed to be \"pan-Egyptian\" by later civili zations -- portrayed Se t as the god of evil. Setians themselves, however, did not then a nd do not now consider Set an evil figure, nor consider the Setian religion merely a refutation of conve ntional religion. Setians perceive the univers e as a non-conscious but or dered environment within which Set has, over a period of millennia, altered the genetic development of at least one form of life to create a species -- humanity -- possessing an enhanced, self- conscious intelligence. The techniques and teachings of the Temple are designed to identify and develop this higher evolutiona ry potential in appropriate individuals. Practices and Behavioral Standards:"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"While Setians focus on their own individual capabilities, they are also expected to have an appreciation of and respect for et hical behavior, to in clude the ideals of whatever social group -- or pol itical state -- they have c hosen to identify themselves with. In addition to conventional means of influe ncing the environment about them, Setians also employ \"magic\", by which they mean universal forces and psychological influences generally unknown to or unrec ognized by society. Setian magic is referred to as \"Black Magic\" to dis tinguish it from \"White Magic\" (invocation of non-existent forces/influences for purposes of self-delus ion). The term \"Black Magic\" carries no connotation of evil or destruc tive intentions or ends. Organizational Structure: The individual initiate is the conceptual fo cus of the Temple, as it is a device for the interaction of individuals as such. It is not a \"mass\" organization. Such structures as it incorporates are merely to e nhance personal opportunities. The Temple as a California corporation is the property of the international Priesthood of Set, which delegates governing author ity to the Council of Nine (board of directors). The Council in turn appoints the Hi gh Priest of Set, the Executive Director, and other officers of the Temple. The Temple includes a number of Orders, each supervised by a Grand Master. These Orders may be somewhat likened to the academic departments of a university, being vehicles for concentration and cooperation in specialized fields of philosophy and magic. Setians may also interact in Pylons, whic h are normally under the guidance of a Priest or Priestess of Set. Pylons are normally ge ographically localized, but also may extend over international distances. Nature and Role of Ministerial Leadership: The Priesthood of Set is not understood to be a \"leadership\" or \"pas toral\" function in a structural or organizational sense. It is rather the di rect, specific, and willful consecration of a particular individual by Se t himself, formally recognized as such by the Temple of Set. Each Priest or Priest ess of Set thus exercises the full religious authority of the entire Temple, subject onl y to the guidance of the Masters of the Temple. One member of the Priesthood is de termined by the Council of Nine to serve as High Priest or High Priestess of Set. The Priesthood of Set is responsible to Set for the care of his Temple, and for reasonable guidance of and assistance to individuals who enter the Temple. The Priesthood is also responsible for dismissi ng from the Temple any person who cannot or will not uphold its initiatory or ethical standards. Worship: There are no regularly scheduled, gro up \"services\" in the Temple. Nor would individual Setians be comfortable with the term \"wor ship\" -- conveying as it does admiration of or devotion to a god or gods based on fear and faith. What the Setian performs instead are Workings of \"Great er Black Magic\" (as distinct from LBM"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"discussed above), in which the personal cons ciousness is raised to direct association with that of Set. Collective GBM Workings involving any number of Setians may take place over great distances, or at gatherings called Conclaves. Dietary Standards: It is the individual consciousness that is sacred within each Setian. Therefore any substance which impairs or distorts the consci ousness, such as hallucinogenic drugs or excessive alcohol, is disapproved of by th e Temple. Other than this there are no dietary guidelines. Funeral or Burial Practices: The center of self-consciousness of each initiated Setian -- the ba of the ancient Egyptians -- is perceived to separate from the physical body when that body ceases to be serviceable to it. The bodily remains th emselves are then not considered to be sacred in any sense, though they may be car ed for in any memorial way desired by the individual and his or her relatives. The ba itself does not separate from the consciou sness of Set, nor from those of other Setians via GBM Workings. Therefore no ri tualized mourning is necessary. Nor are non-Initiates of the Temple, whether officials of conventional religions or not, able or expected to perform any ceremony affecting the ba . Medical Treatment: The Temple has no prohibitions concerning medi cal practices save those that would be offensive to the ethics of the individual Setian. Other Considerations: a. Beliefs or practices which mi ght conflict with a member of the group serving in the military or obeying an order of a duly appointed superior: As an institution the Temple of Set has no policies which in themselves prohibit or inhibit an individual Setian 's national military service. Mention should again be made, however, of the Temple's strong emphasis upon individual and social ethics. If a Setia n in the military of any country were given an order which he or she determ ined to be unacceptably unethical (not merely unpleasant or dangerous), the Temple would endorse that Setian's decision not to comply. The Setian would, of course, be expected to explain precisely upon what ethical grounds su ch a refusal appeared necessary. This expectation that any ethical refusa l be explained is essential. Merely citing affiliation with the Temple of Se t would not suffice. On the other hand, the mere fact that the Temple of Set did not have a written prohibition against some specific act would not prevent the Temple from endorsing a Setian's refusal to perform it if that refusa l were precisely and conscientiously articulated. b. Attitude towards pacifism:"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Temple of Set deplores violence or harm to any living being unless necessary for personal self-protection or preservation. Where an individual Setian's service in a national armed force is concerned, the Temple accepts this as a device for the security of politic al states which humanity has not yet outgrown. If a Setian accepts citizenship in a particular state, then along with that social contract come certain obligations of citizenship, military service perhaps among them. c. Recruitment of New Members: The Temple of Set considers a metaphys ical philosophy to be an intensely personal decision, and that the Setian st ate of awareness and being cannot be \"advertised\" or \"merchandised\" in any wa y. An individual ei ther inclines to this state or does not. Ther efore the Temple does not \"r ecruit\"; rather it simply makes the fact of its existence known and explains enough about itself when approached to interest persons with Setian potential and disinterest those without it.

Satanic Doctrine"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" [Editor's note: This article should be viewed as an \"incomplete\" work, or one that needs significant review, analysis, and expansio n before it can be considered a complete, accurate, and us eful study of the Devil as portrayed in the Bible. I've included it here not because this article itself is worthy of Ruby Tablet publication as is, but because I'd very much like those among us who have extensive knowledge of and understanding of the Bible to modify and add to this article, with the aim of developing a comprehensive and useful study of the Devil as portrayed in the Bible, from both the Satanic and fr om the Christian viewpoint. Meanwhile, it can serve as a starting point for biblical study for those of us who need one.] The Existence of Satan Most of the world views Satan as a stereot ype. They perceive Satan as a two-horned, red- colored, pointy-tailed Devil. Satan's existence is declared in the Bible. Sata n, or some variation of his name, is mentioned in seven Old Testament books. These books are: Genesis, 1 Chronicles, Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah. Every New Testament author refers to Sata n, and he is mentioned in 19 New Testament books. Looking at the numbers here, we find th at 82% of the Old Testament books mention nothing about Satan. And we discover that 30% of the New Testament books mention nothing about Satan. Though this percent is actually 30/ 70, it is close enough to confirm the 33 1/3 to 66 2/3 biblical ratio of Lucifer's departure from heaven. In Lucifer's departure, we discover that Lucifer is reported as leaving h eaven with 1/3 of the angels following him. Using this ratio, we shoul d find one Satanist for every two Christians. This ratio is not out of balance,because we will discover that Satan has always had the fittest, most strongly willed, and most attractive forces on his side. Looking at some new testament authors' rema rks about Satan, let's refer to some new testament experiences and see them from a Satanic perspective. Matthew 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of Satan. Here what we find is a case where the author is really saying Jesus had an experience of imagination, and must account for the experi ence by placing his guilt upon another, so who better than Satan? Mark 5:15 When they came to Jesus, they saw th e man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Classification: V4 - 220.7 - 1 Author: Larry Evans I° Date: June 1, XXIII HTML Revision: Sept. 14, 1998 CE Subject: Bible analysis, Satan Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Here we learn that this large, strong, and crazy man lived like an animal. He had no clothes or shelter, and everyone, I mean everyone, was afraid of him. He usually just scared people to steal some food. This man's real problem was that he was not accepted by people, and this made him lonely. When he frightened people, this was his only interaction, for he knew no other form of communicating with people. All Jesus did was to offer some friendship and acceptance. He further provided a hearty meal and some new clothes. This act of compassion was the beginning of a new life for the man. Here we find that the author dist orts this truth to make the r eader believe that psychological council by Jesus is as exorcism of Satan. Luke 22:3 Then entered Satan in Judas surnamed Is cariot, being of the number of twelve. Judas was the first of Jesus' disciples to learn what Jesus was really all about. We will learn that Judas was really a hero, not a traitor. Hist ory is full of accounts wh ere lunatics in power are brought down by their own supporters. In World War II some of Hitler's generals attempted to murder him. As Hitler c ould manipulate crowds, so did Jesus. 1 John 3:8 He that committeth sin is of Satan; for Satan sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the son of Jehovah was manifested, that he might destroy the works of Satan. There are a number of interesti ng concepts in this statement. First, let's recognize that God does have a name. Christians call hi m Jehovah. Satanists call him Satan. Now having said this, let's look deeper into th e text. Notice the term \"son of Jehovah\". Here we see that God has given his son a \"purpos e\". And, according to the author, the son's \"purpose\" is that of destruction of works that he does not go along with. I thought destruction was a trait the Christians gave to Satan. But, here we find they approve of it when it's in their best interest as they define such a term. Romans 16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Sa tan under your feet s hortly, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. This is another good example of biblical inve rsion of concepts. The phrase \"God of peace\" sounds like a desirable quality, alright, but in the same sentence we discover that Christian peace comes through violence. This portion of the passage gives Christians biblical authority to approve of violence against Satanists anytime and anywhere. 1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary Satan, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. In this statement Peter is warning against psychi c awareness. \"Be sober, be vigilant\" refers to possession of a keen awareness. That awareness is for the purpose of denial of self. \"... because your adversary Satan,\" In this section we see a twist. Peter's warning is proper enough, but now he must offer a substitute for self . When a person denies self, they begin the entry to all unreason. So, who better to lay blam e on for one's shortcomings that Satan? As enough people mix their own inadequacies with self denial for the sake of Christianity, Satan becomes manifest as a real entity."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"This manifestation of Satan is twisted even further with the imagination and illogic taking over at this point. A roaring li on will seldom eat. Lions do not walk about roaring and waiting for dinner to come to them. No, lions stalk their prey. They roar only after their prey has been vanquished. James 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to Jehovah. Resist Satan, and he will flee from you. In these modern times, Christians use this passage as a permit to be rude, closed minded, indifferent, and hostile towards a nyone who is not of like kind. Jude 1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with Sata n he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a raili ng accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. Here is a fine example of the use of langua ge. Should the opportunity present itself, a Christian may attempt to use the term, \"The Lord rebuke you\" on you. Should the direction of a conversation with a Christian be aimed to misd irect their intent, I ha ve found an interesting reaction from several when they are confronted by a Satanist who uses the term, \"The Lord rebuke you\" on them. In the bible we discover Jesus is the proclaim ed enemy of Satan. Howe ver, Jesus only makes mention of Satan fifteen (15) times. Only a very small portion of Jesus' time was occupied with Satan. The reason for this is that Jesus' concern was with his own religion, not with running down those of other beliefs. Let's look at some of the things Jesus said about Satan: Matthew 4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee he nce Satan; for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. What Jesus is saying here is that he is not receptive to Satan's missionary efforts. Jesus responds to Satan by saying, I choose to remain within the confines of my own system. Matthew 16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, ge t behind me, Satan; thou art an offense unto me; for thou savourest not the things that be of Jehovah, but that of men. Here we see Jesus turn on one of his Elect. If we put ourselves in Peter's place, we can imagine what it must have been like to ha ve our Lord accusing us of being Satanic. Now let's turn this one around. Let's say we fi nd ourselves in a discussion with a Christian. Something happens, the timing is right, and we lash out at the Christ ian by saying, \"Get thee behind me, Jehovah; thou art an offense unto me.\" Matthew 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on th e left hand, depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for Satan and his angels. Jesus is cursing all those of the Left Hand Path (L.H.P.) here. And who does Jesus claim are the L.H.P. followers? Anyone who does not accept his teaching is a L.H.P. follower according to Jesus. John 6:70 Jesus answered then, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a Satanist?"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"This one is brilliant. Gather your (few remaini ng) supporters, and claim that one of them is the enemy. If something goes wrong, you come out looking like a prophet. If everything remains normal, your statement will soon be forgotten. Luke 22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Sa tan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. And Satan said, Simon, Simon, get a hold on yourself , Jehovah hath desired to take your soul, that he may separate you from you. Thus we can see much evidence in the bibl e for the existence of Satan. Though the bible offers evidence of Satanic existence, what does it say about Satanic origin? The Origin of Satan A Christian cynic asks, \"If Jehova h is so wise and good, then why did he create Satan, and if he is so powerful, why doesn't he destroy Sata n?\" A typical Christian response is, \"He didn't, but he will.\" A simple Satanic counter is, \"You're right, and you're wrong.\" Jehovah did not create Satan, because God can not create God. As gods, Satan is Jehovah's equal. When Christians proclaim that Jehovah will destroy Satan, they reinforce the idea that Christianity is a religion of destruction. The purpose of Christian destruction is dominance, not tolerance. Satan's chief Daemon is called Lucifer. Before Lucifer left heaven, he was known to be a guardian cherub. Cherubim are special angels assigned to protect Jehovah. (From what? That's an interesting question.) After Lucifer's departure from heaven, Jehovah had to assign four cherubim to do the work that Lucifer had previously done. Th e first is described as lion-lik e, the second is calf-like, the third is as a man, and the fourth is eagle-like. Revelation 4:6-8 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto chrystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and th e second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face of a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts each had six wings about him; and they were full of ey es within; and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord Jehovah almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. Isaiah 14:12-14 How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once la id low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' Lucifer's Five Proclamations are:"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"1. I will ascend into heaven. By this statement Lucifer is saying he will remanifest himself within the confines of both L.H.P. and R.H.P. religions. 2. I will exalt my throne above the stars of Je hovah. Lucifer will make himself into a God. 3. I will sit upon the mount of the congregation. Luci fer will be the leader of another religion. 4. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. Lucifer mostly travels by air. 5. I will be like the Most High. Lucifer pred icts he will become El-Elyon, Jehovah's title, \"The Most High\". The Personality of Satan We have seen some biblical evidence for the ex istence and origin of Satan. Now let's look at Satan's personality. Satan is intelligent. Christians realize this, a nd still can often be outwitted. This frustrates them to no end, and causes my mind to smirk every time I do it. The bible proclaims such intelligence: 2 Corinthians 2:11 Least Satan should get an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices. Christians strive for child-lik e minds. What kind of Christian adult would forsake adulthood? Yet: 2 Corinthians 11:3 ... So your minds should be corrupted fro m the simplicity that is in Jesus. Satan possesses great memory. Biblical Christia nity bears this out. According to the bible, Satan tempted Jesus several times (Matthew 4:1-11). Satan did this through a knowledge of the Old Testament. When Jesus refuted Satan' s biblical charges, he referred to the Old Testament. As we will learn later, the Satanic authority of modern man makes up two parts of the Diabolical Trinity. This Diabolical Trinity can absorb strength via the new testament. As Satanists, we have biblical authority to expl ain the Satanic truths, for the purpose of self advancement. Satan possesses great will. The apostle Paul in structs the youthful Timothy to be firm but gentle with Christians who are frustrated with their religion. Again we find a keen draw to Satanism is its great will that manifests within its Initiates. 2 Timothy 2:26 They may recover themselves out of the snare of Satan, who are taken captive by him at his will. Satan possesses emotions. Biblical accounts of Satan's emotions are limited, but we can find three examples. This does not mean that Sa tan only has three emotions; Satan has many emotions and he freely uses them. The three emo tions we will look at are desire, pride, and wrath."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Luke 22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Sa tan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. Christian concepts of desire ar e little more than a Satanic id ea to communicate truth. In the above example, we find Satan's true desire is to be an educator and informer of men. Satanism is a religion of Study, not Worship. According to Christian teachings, the second Satani c emotion is pride. Chri stians are afraid of pride, because they believe prid e comes before a fall. They s ee it as the road to ruin. The second Satanic Statement from The Satanic Bible proclaims: \"Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.\" This sounds like pride to me don't you think so? 1 Timothy 3:6 Not a novice, least being lifted up with pride he fa ll into condemnation of Satan. The third Satanic emotion is wrath. From the R. H.P. point of view this one makes sense, right? Wrath, the emotion they assign to bot h Jehovah and Satan. Of course, Jehovah's wrath is justified by belief. However, Satan's wrath is evil and diaboli cal. Looking at the subjec t objectively, wrath is wrath, be it Christian or Satanic. Consider this: Revelation 12:12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the Christian inhabiters of the earth and of the Sea! For Satan is come unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he have eternity to rule. According to Christian doctrine, perhaps Satan has this authority because man was given the ability to reason by Jehovah?!? Revelation 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulations, a nd poverty (but thou ar t rich), and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan. This is one of my favorites, for here we fi nd that Christian allegations refute their own testimony. If one is known as rich, how and why do Christians acknowledge the individual as poor, unless their motive is un-Christian, and if such motive be non-Christian, be such motive Satanic? Revelation 2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest of Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. Hope you like this as much as I. This looks as though Christians have au thority to take their \"gospel\" to areas unknownst of Ch ristian principles. However, what is really explained here is while Christian missionaries pursue undevel oped areas with a passion, Satan will pursue developed Christian areas with a passion. Sa tanic doctrine compels us to educate the Known'st, not the Unknown'st. Revelation 12:4 And his tail drew the third part of th e stars of Heaven, and did cast them to the earth; ..."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"This is Satan's one to two ratio which was s poken about earlier. Christians like to believe there is strength in numbers, so they satisfy their belief by making it look as though we can't win; it's as though we are outnumbered. We know Satan's forces are more intelligent, mo re fit, and stronger than Christian forces. The intelligence comes from study, fitn ess comes through pride, and strength comes from coming into being. Revelation 20:7-8 And when the thousand years are e xpired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations wh ich are in the four quarters of the earth... Here we discover the biblical authority of Sata n to rule for a thousand years. What both we and the Christians must be apprised of is , when did this rule become effective? Perhaps, as the prophets of old, we are the proph ets of late. Should such be so inclined, should we not be bold enough to proclaim the Aeon of our age? Now, is the infancy of our age. Thusly we should proclaim. The Names of Satan I trust you will enjoy the names of Satan as much as I. At one time Satan, according to Christianity, was known as the Prince of Para dise. We will soon come to understand why Christians are so confused about Satan. For one reason, they assign him twenty-two (22) names, and frequently mix reference terms when they attempt to describe him. Let's examine the names: Satan: The most common name used, but the bible only mentions the name Satan 52 times. (That's once a week for a year.) The Devil: Less common than Satan, the term Devil is used only 35 times in the Bible. The Prince of the Power of the Air: Ephesians 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air... What kind of being is not grateful for the air? This passage may suggest why Christians never refer to the air in their sermons. The God of this World: 2 Corinthians 4:4 In whom the God of this world ha th blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of god, should shine unto them. 2 Snaihthiroc 4:4 In whom the Christians of this worl d hath blinded the minds of the open, lest the truth of the knowledge of your glorious self, who is the image of God, should rein unto them. The King of Death:"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Hebrews 2:14 For as much then as the children ar e partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that throu gh death he might destroy, that is the Devil. What this says is that we are all flesh and bl ood. All, that is, except Satan. This text implies that Jesus had to die to break Satan's curse. However, in doing so (dying, that is), Jesus elevated Satan to the same status as Jehova h. As Jehovah was never flesh and blood, neither was Satan. Unlike Jehovah, Satan has many sons and daughters. A biblical teaching is, be fruitful and multiply. Did Jehovah, perhaps, forget his own teaching? Or was he incapable of having more than one son? The Prince of this World: John 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: no w shall the Prince of the World be cast. The judgment of this world refers to the judgmen t against those Christians of the far R.H.P. The casting of the Prince refers to the L.H.P. Seer's. The R.H.P. calls these people prophets. The Ruler of Darkness: Ephesians 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against prin cipalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. When confronted by a Christian who becomes a ggressive and hostile, re call this scripture. \"Ephesians 6:12, your own doctrine, says: 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood.' So by what authority do you provoke me? If you truly wres tle against principal ities, powers, and the Rulers of Darkness, why do you persecute me? Is not persecution a trait of Satan? And if you persecute me, does this not mean you are of Satan?\" Leviathan: JOB 41:1-2 Canst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook? Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? Jesus taught his disciples to be \"fishermen of men's souls.\" As a man's soul dwells within the sea of humanity, there it shall re main through remanifestation. To snatch one's soul from that sea of humanity is akin to sn atching a fish from the waters. Consider this: what becomes of that snatched fish? Who does the snatching? And who taught man to snatch men's souls? Be this true, heaven becomes hell, good becomes evil, and Jesus becomes the deceiver. Lucifer: Isaiah 14:12 How are thou fallen from heaven, O Luci fer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which di dst weaken the nations. Lucifer is one of the most used names of Satan in today's culture. However, it is interesting to note that this is the only passage in the Bi ble that mentions Luci fer by name. Lucifer is mentioned nowhere else in the bible. The Dragon:"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Revelation 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon; and the Dragon fought, and his angels. Since Christian doctrines proclaim that all the evil angels left heaven with Lucifer, how is it that their own scripture indicates angels will join with the Dragon to fight against Michael? For everyone knows departed angels become Da emons. So if angels join with the Dragon, then this says there are still malcontent angels in the heavens. And if the angels feel like this, woe be unto the soul that ends up there. The Deceiver: Revelation 20:10 And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet ha d been thrown. They will be tormended day and night for ever and ever. Here we have another example of how Christians have inverted the truth. They would have us believe that Satan not only is the deceiver, but is himself deceived. Satan proposed this unto you: Is it not Jehovah who is the true deceiver of multitudes? And, if Sa tan desireth not thy soul, what does Jehovah intend to do with it, and why? Apollyon: Revelation 9:11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. The Satanic Destroyer does not destroy fles h and blood or property. The Satanic Apollyon destroys the veil of blindness from the human psyche. The Destroyer is highly effective and powerful at reaching deep within such psyche for such purpose. For this purpose Apollyon is swift and effective. Beelzebub: Matthew 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, this fellow doth not cast out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils. I see here that the religious leaders of the da y recognized that Jesus ha d absorbed and twisted Satan's Will for Jehovah's own purposes. Due to this, the Pharisees were able to see the deception of Jesus and his intent to undermine Jehovah for his own purposes. Belial: 2 Corinthians 6:15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? An oft-used scripture, used to exclude those suspect of non-conformity by Christians, and to attempt to link Belial (Satan) wi th vileness and ruthlessness. The Wicked One: 1 John 5:19 And we know that we are of Jehovah, and the whole world lieth in wickedness."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"This is the mind set of a Chri stian. They believe all who are not one of them are wicked. Therein lies their true nature, for if you're not one of them, your wickedness must be destroyed. The destruction of their wicked side is pure wickedness in itself. As they accuse, so they are. The Tempter: 1 Thessalonians 3:5 For this cause I could no longer forb ear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and labour be in vain. I enjoy this title. It sounds so pleasant to my ears. The Tempter, the one who tempts. You could still say no, could you not? And could the Tempter be another name for the fishermen of men's souls? Does not the fisherman tempt th e fish with bait? Could the fish choose not to nibble? The Accuser of the Brethren: Revelation 12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of Jehovah, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accuses them before Jehovah day and night. Makes sense, right? Who would accuse those who are of Jehovah but Satan? One has to wonder what the evangelist really means to communicate, when they accuse their own brethren of Sin. The Angel of Light: 2 Corinthians 11:14-15 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great th ing if his ministers also be tr ansformed as the ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works. As I see this transformation, it is the biblical auth ority for remanifestation. \"Righteousness according to works.\" A Liar: Genesis 3:4-5 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for Jehovah doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. The lie of Jehovah is the trut h of Satan. The first sin was the sin of knowledge. What knowledge? The knowledge of Godhood. A Murderer: John 8:44 Ye are of your father Satan, and the lu sts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of hi s own; for he is the father of it."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Again Satan stands accused of being a murderer. What not his first accusation that of a liar? But in this text it is proclaimed he was firs t a murderer. Did they falsely blame Satan for all the deaths that occurred in the name of Christ throughout time? The Enemy: Matthew 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is Satan; th e harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. Can there be a reaping of the ha rvest without the sowi ng of the seed? Which angels are it that reap the harvest? Those of Jehovah or Satan? A Roaring Lion: 1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary Satan, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. The Activities of Satan The Diabolical Trinity: The bibl ical Satan has a trinity, as Je hovah has a trinity. As Jehovah assumes the role of Father, Satan assumes the role of the father figure. Jesus Christ is likened to the Antichrist. At one point they are both flesh and blood. And the Sa tanic spirit becomes the counter to the Holy Spirit. Revelation 16:13 And I saw three Unholy Spirits like fi re come out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, a nd out of the mouth of the false prophet. The Biblical Authority of Sata nic Churches and Temples: Revelation 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulations, a nd poverty (but thou ar t rich), and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Christians should rally to our cause. Their ow n ultimate prayers can never become realized until the Satanic prophecies are fulfilled. Satan Has His Doctrine: 1 Timothy 4:1 Now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the later times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and Doctrines of Satan. Here is the biblical authority for this text of mine. The \"Satanic Doctrine\" is from a departed of the faith, for the purpose of giving h eed to seducing spirits (those of Xeper and Remanifestation). This work may serve as an in spiration to others to explore new depths in these latter times. Satan has mysteries which many will never Understand: 2 Thessalonians 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"This really says that your knowledge of the L.H. P. will cause you to part with the R.H.P. This parting will be the beginning of your remanifestation. Satan will attract 1/3 of the angels in heav en. According to Christianity, when Lucifer departed heaven 1/3 of the ange ls left with him. From that time on, those angels were known as Demons. In Revelation 12:4 (above), it expl ains that another 1/3 of the remaining 2/3 angels in heaven will join Satan. Again in Revelation 12:7 (above), we find two for ces going into battle. Th is is where 1/3 of the angels in heaven join the departed angels (demons) to defend themselves from Jehovah's forces. It seems the Christian destiny is to lo ose the heavenly realm by attack on a stronger, better prepared entity. It is the nature of the R.H. P. to do battle. Satan desireth not the shedding of blood. Blood letting is an Old Testament principle that the Christians of this time would like to reinstate and be in control of. Satan explains the bible from his perspective: 1) Satan puts the bible in his context. 2) Satan interprets the bible to benefit his Will. 3) Satan stresses his side of his doctrine. 4) Satan understresses unimportant doctrines. Contrary to popular opinions, Satan has no fear of the word of Jehovah. In fact, many Satanists delight in it. Just as Christians use it for their ow n devices, so do Satanists. Satan has the power to hinder Jehovah's works: 1 Thessalonians 2:18 \"Wherefore we would have come unto you even I Paul, once again, but Satan hindered us.\" Satan also hinders the work s of Jehovah by resisting Christian's prayers. Satan has the power to afflict: In Job 2:7, Luke 13:16, and 2 Corinthians 12:7, you will find examples of Christians who were afflicted by the power of Satan. Sata n's power can oppress in both physical and psychological realms. Jehovah's authority is not sufficient to stop th e curses of Satan. Though there are some few examples of curse breaking in the bible, ther e are none of curse prevention. Woe be unto the one who crosses the Satanist. Satan performs miracles: 2 Thessalonians 2:9 Ev en him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and wonders. The power in the name of Satan is great. As peop le can be healed in the name of Jesus, they can as well be healed in the name of Satan. Satan performs miracles. Footnotes 1.

Definition: apologetics -- the ar t of arguing for or defending one's point of view in philosophy or religion.) Introduction The following comments were prompted by a ra dio broadcast of KKUP Radio in Cupertino, CA., a talk show which a number of us were able to hear thanks to the efforts of Adept Tim McGranahan. The unidentified Setian who called into the program deserves credit for sticking with the grueling interview. A point came up that invites discussion am ong Setians, a question from one of the interviewers: \"How does the Temple of Set as a religion differ from neo-paganism, or does it?\" It would have been difficult for anyone to have given a lucid response on the spot, as the matter goes beyond the question of worshipping some thing in the natural order or not, without a discussion of the factors that character ize a religious effort as neo-pagan. Classification: V2 - 290.P - 1 Author: Ruth Nielsen II° Date:  October,  XXV  Publication: Trail of the Serpent HTML Revision: Sept. 14, 1998 CE Subject: N eo-Paganism Reading List: 3C"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The original discussion derived from comments in an article from Gnosis , which in brief stated that pagan organizations were now havi ng to use the same arguments for freedom of religious expression in this country as ha ve the orthodox Judeo-Ch ristian religions. Elements of Neo-Paganism The term \"neo-paganism\" implies two things: First that what it describes relates to what is known as paganism, and secondly that it is so mehow new. The defini tion I learned as a Catholic of \"pagan\" is \"one who worships fa lse gods.\" For this commentary, \"paganism\" will mean any religion of non-Christian, non-Hebrew origin prior to 1900. This is from the viewpoint of a society that uses the Bible as a frame of reference for religious matters. Any religion other than the Hebrew worship of YHWH (Yahweh -- Jehovah), or the Catholic and Anglican worship of God as a Trinity of Di vine Being, or the Protestant worship of Jesus Christ, is the worship of false gods, and theref ore paganism, neo or not. From the viewpoint of our culture then, we are considered pagans. Clearly th ere will be a revolution in thinking once the Setian influence is more widespread. The 1900 cutoff is arbitrary, and I chose it because the proliferation of esoteric literature which made the neo-pagan movement possible co incided with the techno logical advances in communication that accompanied the global wars. The educated frames of reference which allowed people to explore with some impunity the subjects consider ed taboo by the orthodox religions were produced by the emergence and growth of the analyt ical and interpretive sciences aimed at understanding human behavior from various perspectives, coupled with technological advances. This was largely aided by the separation of philosophy and religion from the sciences, unlike the tr aditions of ancient civiliza tions. Consequently, archaeology, anthropology, psychology, and numerous other sc iences found eager audiences in the group variously called New-Age, Aquarian Age, and Neo-Pagan. For purposes of clarity, the term \"neo-pagan \" is selected here, though many persons who accept the labels of \"New-Age\" and \"Aquarian Age\" would balk at the \"Neo-Pagan\" label, due to their strong ties with orthodox religions. They all arrive sooner or later at union with Something-Or-Other. The question is, \"Whose God(s) are false?\" It is obvious that a major problem of the hum an race is communication in religious matters, including understanding the basi c beliefs that characterize th e various factions. Since the society we live in is largely influenced by Jude o-Christian beliefs, like it or not we are faced with their terminology when trying to communi cate. By their designation, we are pagans, albeit neo-pagans, and the worst kind yet: satanists. Anything that has any as sociation with the Devil is automa tically pagan. I choose to reserve the designation \"The Devil\" to refer to the Ch ristian aberration which they use to represent Satan. In their minds there is no distinction. That is why it is important for us to know what we are talking about. The less ambiguous we are, the harder it is for them to subvert our meanings. The task then is one of education, of ourse lves and of the public who may encounter us, whether personally or collectively, in private or on the public airwaves."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The rest of this article will first discuss how four categories of analysis can be used to quickly size up not only pagan but Judeo-Christian religi ons as well. This article will then look at Setianism in the light of these four categories, with a summary of key words that a Setian can use with ease when encountering th e barbs of the right hand path. In analyzing the commonly known ancient religions, I found the following basic characteristics to appear consistently in eac h. These four categories have proven useful in quickly analyzing any system for purposes of discussion, or to simply form a picture for future reference: 1) Deities, 2) Mysteries, 3) Initiatory States, and 4) Mythology. While examining these four areas, keep in mind the Ba sic Question: 'What does this religion do for the individual?' A brief explanation of thes e follows, and then this model is applied consecutively to Paganism, Neo-Paganism, Chri stianity, Judaism, and Setianism. The purpose is to assist the Setian in communicating clea rly and confidently w ith people who have divergent religious viewpoints. The passionate world of apologeti cs is one that someday will involve every Setian, perhaps in their own home. But if one looks for basic concep ts such as these four categories: deities, mysteries, initiatory states, a nd mythology, plus considering the basic question, it is far easier to try to sort out the mora ss of religious differences to discuss them rationally. It isn't necessary to be well versed in any other religion either. Ju st kindly question the opponent, and then fit those responses to the ap propriate category, never forgetting the most basic question: what is the goal of this system for the individual? If it comes down to ultimate union with Something-Or-Other, no matter how mystically attractive or objectively productive, it is the real paganism using the C hurch's own definition -- the worship of false gods. If the Setian sees Self as the ultimate G od-form of realization, there can be no other answer. Paganism 1. Deities : A core pantheon. Perhaps one particular de ity and his consort were designated as the supreme beings. These were all given human traits in super-human proportions, and linked with cosmic forces or perceived realities in a somewhat archetypal manner. Archaeological evidence seems to suggest that the first god forms venerated were of the Goddess or mother type. It was not until this century that the concep t of archetype as a factor of the human subconscious was widely understood through the works of Carl Jung. So it can't be assumed that this was the intent among the ancients, t hough in some cases the written evidence of symbolism suggests similar concepts existed. Ho wever, when one considers the proliferation of deities, for example to the point of the latte r dynasties of Egypt, the concept of archetype becomes unwieldy in trying to understand ancient religions. 2. Mysteries : The actual basic beliefs and technique s for accessing the power of the deities were called mysteries. The mysteries were aligne d with premises that explained the objective universe, sometimes clearly to the initiates, and sometimes they were ambiguous in the extreme. The initiate was lead to believe that comprehension or mastery of the mysteries was up to him, and his progress was correlative of his effort and the gods' favor."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Looking beneath the surface, one can see that there were many layers of understanding among the more sophisticated of the nature religions , wherein the realm of the natural becomes a portal to the divine in the ha nds of the evolved. Examples of these are the shamanistic traditions of the American and Eastern Indians. What is basic to all of these religions is that the highest form of individual expression is wors hip of the deities, with the goal of union with the divine upon physical death. The symbolism of the natural components was la rgely not accessible to the unlearned except in broad terms, and was considered the goal of formal initiation into the religious or philosophical systems. 3. Initiatory states : Often these had political and econom ic raisons d'etre. Access to the mysteries, and thus the deities, was c ontrolled by those who had the knowledge. Accomplishments were often socially valuable, conferring status that resulted in recognition, power, and wealth to those w ho appeared to have special abilities or dedication. 4. Mythology : the popularly accessible form of the my steries noted in cultural expression. Mythology is often the basis for the arts and sciences, with socioeconomic implications whenever large numbers of people were engage d. This provides the hi storical records. A classic example is the tombs of the Egyptian kings. Neo-Paganism Neo-paganism is a term applied loosely to a wi de diversity of religions which exist in the modern western world, but did not exist prior to 1900 in thei r present form, and religions which are disavowed by the Judeo-Christian orthodoxies. When compared against the elements listed above for paganism, some di fferences and similarities are apparent. 1. The Deities are more or less similar to what is known of the ancient on es, but within the various groups of neo-pagans, the deities seem to be selected in an eclectic manner. The conceptual framework is tempered by the adhere nt's education and cultural origin. A current example is Santeria, originating from African root s, but diverse in its pr actice in this country. White, middle class Santeria pr actitioners of Catholic backgr ound view Santeria differently from the Hispanic Catholics who grew up with the cultural tolerance of magical themes. 2. The mysteries are more esoteric, since today's knowle dge base is greater (we think) than that of ancient common man. Many things lear ned today in general science classes would have been considered mysteries, if known in ancient times. This knowledge base varies today by one's cultural group and its educational achievements. The symbolic is more clearly apparent to part icipants today than it seems to have been in ancient times, at least among cultu res participating in what is called western civilization. Regardless of the deities, the terms, or the co mplexity of the concepts, the basic mysteries continue to focus on a subjective birth experi ence wherein a new identity is formed, a \"coming out,\" in which the person is anointe d, a sharing of food in a sacrificial sense, 7 and others directed to the them es of marriage and death. 3. Initiatory states : These are less likely to be economically or politically valuable now than they were in ancient times. Frequently, neo- pagan participants are penalized in modern"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"society by disapproval or outright hostility when their initiatory accomplishments become known outside the religious group, es pecially if the initiate hold s a position of responsibility in today's \"modern\" culture. Though this has always been the case throughout history, it is remarkable in an age when liberalism and the tenets of the humanistic movement are so widely accepted. 4. Mythology is notably sparse in today's culture, pe rhaps because the same technologies that brought the cosmos closer to the eyes of ma n has also brought us the dramas of radio, television and literature. From av ailable literature, it is apparent that current mythology relies heavily on the remnants of ancient mythologies. The trend is that the individual develops his own mythology, derived from accepted elements in the group, and feeds them back into the group. It is also common to see discus sions of experience in psychol ogical rather than mythological terms, or in attempts to interrelate the two. It is in this area that modern science has assisted the psyche in providing such concepts as the archetype and layers of consciousness, since mythology is invariably an emotional expression. Some authors have pointed out that the human do es not seem to thrive when deprived of a meaningful mythology. An interesting trend is found today, in that psychotherapists are increasingly using various philosophical or re ligious systems to effectively treat patients. These range anywhere from astrology to ayurvedi c medicine with some unique insights into the role of ritual and myth in the main tenance of mental and emotional health. Christianity When one looks at the Judeo-Christian religi ons using these same four criteria, some interesting conclusions surface. Christianity is blatantly paga n, using the Roman Catholic Church as an example. (We know that, but our well-meaning friends don't.) Let's take a look, and then see how modern Judaism compares after that. 1. deities : The famous Holy Trinity that used to give me a headache in catechism class is still not adequately explained. The Holy Trinity is God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Ghost. Count that. You get 3, a nd I always got 3, but it's not: it's ONE. An incredible amount of human hours and lives and material resources have been used in trying to explain that idiocy. There is some fascinating reading in the letters of the early Church Fathers and the beliefs prior to the Council of Nicea. In summary th e aim was to once and forever squelch any isolated pockets of rebelli on. The political gains achieved by the Holy Roman Empire upon the adoption of Christianity are still being felt. And one of the chief motivators for political rebellion is religious differences. Thus we see in God the Father both the YHWH of the Hebrews and the various attempts at describing Apollo as the God above Gods amon g the Greek philosophers. In God the Son and the events of His earthly life we find plagiarisms of various cults such as that of Mithras. In God the Holy Ghost is every concept the mystic could desire, sufficien tly ambiguous to allow unlimited explanation and devoti on. Surely the philosophers and gnostics could be kept busy."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The pantheon of deities would not be complete without the legendary saints. These were not supposed to be worshipped, as they were not di vine. It was claimed that they had all lived exemplary lives, and were worthy of veneration. There was a saint for every day of the year, and for almost any function you could think of except sex. The Blessed Virgin Mary was not supposed to be divine either, but some of her feasts are Holy Days of \"Obligation,\" wherein the Cathol ic was supposed to attend Mass. If one didn't attend this Mass without good cause it was a mortal sin, and one would go to Hell if one died on the spot. That kind of requirement is know n as mandatory worship, and in any other religion is reserved for divinity. Further, much of the reasoning for Mary's being Blessed and Virgin is due to divine interv ention, and is therefore a matter of faith, meaning that a Catholic can be excommunicated for heresy if he is not willing to accept these dogmas. Commonly used to \"honor\" Mary, the Hail Mary's are nothi ng but invocations to a Mother Goddess. Mary has been an extremely touchy subject for Catholic ism. Technically she is a saint, but just try calling her that in a conversa tion with devout Catholics. Some of the other female saints who are highly \"venerated\" do not come out so well either under scrutiny, especially when cults have been established around them. St. Therese of The Child Jesus, a Carmelite nun also known as The L ittle Flower, is a well know example, a saint who still continues to \"perform miracles,\" and whose story is spread through the blessed rose petals her followers pass out to souls in nee d. She is very popular in Wisconsin. The word \"cult\" is not used lightly either, as the behavior of these devout folks does meet the description of cultist behavior. So far the Trinity of God is still the basic dogma. The established goal of Christiani ty is even more insistent than previous religions on the fact that the soul is to achieve union with God in this life, with the culmination in the hereafter to the extent even of loss of iden tity. It still spells stasis a nd loss of Self determination. The Protestant denominations, even those which reje ct the doctrine of the Trinity and allow only for Jehovah (Yahweh-YHWH) as the deity, do no better in the end. 2. The mysteries of Christianity are basically those termed the sacraments, which are given during special rituals. These allow the recipien t to \"receive grace\" and deepen his relationship with God. They explain not only the orderi ng of the objective unive rse, but also the subjective, so that the individual explores them within a framework of tradition and expectation of specific results . Deviation is not possible w ithout the charge of heresy. Counterparts of all of the sacraments and ritu als can be found in accounts of ancient pagan practices and current neo-pagan ones. \"The Lord did everything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal chamber.\" 3. The initiatory states are achieved through certain sacr aments which are designed to empower the individual to live in a higher state than previously, which means closer to God. These include Baptism (entrance into the faith with sworn allegiance to the dogmas), Penance (in which one is absolved of sins and no longer responsible for them on the subjective levels), and Holy Eucharist (the communal partaking of the \"flesh and blood of Christ\"). In the Protestant denominations the Holy Eucharist is considered a symbolic act. The Catholic however must believe he is actually eating of the body of Christ and drinking his blood in a unique, non-rational concept called transubstantiation."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Confirmation (chrism-anointing) allows one to become a fuller participant in the life of the Holy Spirit through receiving His Gifts of which there are seven. This is the highest that a lay person may achieve who is not accepted into the priesthood. It is expected that the confirmed individual can handle all aspects of th e faith including mystical experiences. The sacrament of the Eucharist when first recei ved is considered a step between the baptism and the confirmation. The redemption sacrament (P enance) is a continuation of the baptismal cleansing of sins, as is the Sacrament of th e Sick. The sacrament of Holy Matrimony is required for entrance to the married state. It's significance has always been debated in the most sublime terms. It is used as the model to describe the relationship of God with the soul, and Christ with His Body the Church. The coupl e are instructed to tr eat each other in that context, to the extent that they even consider intercourse as the culmination of the sacrament, and their own personal euchar ist uniting them with God. Holy Orders is the sacrament of ordination to the priesthood, and continues the redemptive action as the priest performs r ituals at which the sacraments are given to the others. Even though a man may become bishop or pope, he will ne ver be more a priest than when ordained. The power to ordain, however, is reserved to the bishops. Extreme Unction, now called the Sacrament of the Si ck, is given to assist the sick or dying in dealing with the end of life. Variations are now used that simulate the actions of the shamanistic religions. These are usually culturally specific. Exorcism is not a sacrament, and in spite of th e movie sensationalism it is rarely used. It is a specific ritual treatment for possession by evil spir its. Again counterparts of all of these will be familiar to readers from various magickal systems and pagan traditions. 4. The mythology of Christianity is some of the mo st muddled that exists. A fascinating account that is also good reading is the book Pagans and Christians , which documents the growth of Christianity from the very first century using verifiable data. Th ere is a great deal of useful information on paganism. It is obvious from this book why the biggest problem in the Christian world is censorship. Without approval from the church hierarchy, rega rdless of the denomination, various practices cannot be started or altered. Creativity except alo ng clearly prescribed li nes is not allowed, or one stands to lose his eternal soul. Yet many fringe cults exist, even within the USA, often with only tacit approval of the Church. They bring in revenue to th e local churches, so tolerance is beneficial. But th is aspect of religion is well known in pagan circles also. There has been speculation down through the centu ries upon the reasons for the similarities between Christian and pagan religious systems. In addition to the outright assimilation of pagan elements into Christia nity, there is another: \"Judaism, Christianity, and the mysteries were equally parts of the religious milieu of the Greco-Roman world, and this explains many of their similarities. As Greco-Roman religions, they sometimes faced similar challenges, propos ed similar ways of salvation, and shared similar visions of the way to light and life.\""},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Judaism In looking at Judaism from the four perspectiv es cited earlier, I sele cted the writings of contemporary prominent Jews. It is clear from what follows how binding, and how blinding to true inner vision, are the ties to tradition. The sources cited here are from a collection titled Ancient Roots and Modern Meanings , edited by Jerry V. Diller. The book covers the extremes in Jewish thought of the late 70's. 1. deities : Where does Judaism stand on the subject of deities? Richard L. Rubenstein made the following comments: \"We stand in a cold, silent, unfeeling cosm os, unaided by any purpos eful power beyond our own resources. After Auschwitz, what else can a Jew say about God?\" A former rabbi, he chose to separate himsel f from the established Jewish community, though his work is representative of the radical r eappraisal among Jews who, clinging to their one God, have experienced genocide re peatedly for their trust. On the other side is Irving Gr eenburg who states: \"There is a God who cares, human beings have infinite value.\" But later on he admits: \"The Holocaust suggests a Divine presence far more subtle and elusive than hitherto estimated.\" Also, \"He controls himself. He is the hidden presence, not the intervening presence [because] Hi s people continue to exist in defiance of all logic and all force.\" Rubenstein states that Judaism is \"largely a this-worldly religion. It focuses attention upon the requirements of I and Thou in here and now. ... The Christian Church claimed th at some of the tragic inevitabilities of the human condition had been overcome through the caree r of Jesus. Before this claim, the rabbis preferred their sad wisd om that the human condition had not been altered. They focused Jewish attention on those norms which could make life's limitations more viable, rather than on a savior who promised to overcome the limita tions. The fundamental Jewish posture is one of realism before existence, rath er than one of seeking an escape from the world's necessities.\" He most poignantly states the dilemma of the m odern Jew who, faced with the reality of this world, isn't sure what or where his God is, if i ndeed he exists at all. Those who tenaciously hold on to the mystical traditions of the kaballah do so at the price of i nvolved explanations of the hidden God. In utter disillusionment, Rubenstein states not only for the Jew, but for many of the denominations in the Judeo-Christian religions: \"... the time of the death of God does not mean the end of all gods. It means the demise of the God who was the ultimate actor in history. I be lieve in God, the Holy Nothingness, known to mystics of all ages, out of which we have come and to which we shall ultimately return. I concur with atheistic existentialism [in] ... their analysis of the broken human condition of finitude. We must endure that condition without illusion or hope. ... The condition of finitude can only be overcome when we return to the No thingness out of which we have been thrust. In the final analysis, omnipotent No thingness is Lord of all creation.\""},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Nothingness or not, it is the concept of final di ssolution into Another, wi th resultant loss of Self, that is the identifying established goal, however reluctant, that links this aspect of Judaism with paganism -- the worship of false gods. 2. Mysteries : Rubenstein goes on to elaborate upon the traditional aspects of Jewish religious life, stating that it is within the religious community as an institution that the condition of human \"hopelessness\" can be shared in depth. Interestingly, the mysteries identified were initially experiences that the Jews as a people went through, a nd which they have been using since the historical occurrences as symbols of recurring collective a nd individual challenges to faith, or initiations as we would look at it. An example is the Passover Seder celebrating the Exodus. However this is a glaring contradiction of God as NOT \"the intervening presence\". \"The main doctrine of the prophe ts can be called 'pathetic theo logy'. ... Their attitude toward what they knew about God can be described as [a] religion of sympathy. The Divine pathos, or as it was later called, the Middot, stood in the ce nter of their consciousness. The life of the prophet revolved around the life of God. This is the pattern of Jewish mysticism: to have an open heart for the inner life of G od. It is based on two assumptions : that there is an inner life in God, and that the existence of man ought to revolve in a spiritual dynamic course around the life of God.\" Once again the preoccupation is with pleasing the deity. One can find examples of similar material in so me of the ancient dialogues, quoted in modern reprints of the Greek poets who transcribed the words of the Oracles. See Pagans and Christians , the chapter entitled Language of the Gods , pp. 234 & 235, and Ancient Mysteries , which has numerous examples throughout the book. 3. Initiatory states are designed to help the individual deal with the \"here and now.\" Though strictly limited to the male members of the co mmunities, the roles availa ble have thousands of years of tradition to reinforce their importance upon the Jew. The women have their role, and presumably their satisfaction of religious need s, in that they assume whatever tasks are necessary so that the husbands and sons can freely pursue the religious observances and studies. These are of two types: the rational and the non- rational. The first is the realm of the rabbi, whose task is a life-long confrontat ion of the sacred texts in orde r to continually keep in front of his congregation the need for and beauty of God's order in this world. The aim is a peaceful and productive world, in areas as diverse as the most humane way to kill animals to insights on politics. The non-rational involves the mystical side of Judaism, which is often centered upon the kaballah. These two distinct aspects of Judaism are accompanied by two others, one discussed under mythology and the other here. The latter has b een widely published in the works of Martin Buber in the \"I-Thou\" discussion called \"Dialogu e.\" This state of being is described as: \"The total and unmediated contact between the individual, and various aspects of his world: objects, other people and God Himself. ... Holine ss and spirituality reside in the complete"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"meeting of two entities, a meeting in which each totally experiences the uniqueness of the other and does nothing to diminish it\". 4. Mythology : The most noticeable thing about Jewish myth and tradition is the lack of emotional restraint, and this de scribes a state that is similar to the initiatory states found in other cultures, especially of the tropics. Since it is associ ated often with the simplest of understanding, I think it is more logi cal to consider it under mythology. \"Judaism is a religion of strong emotions. Its ca lendar chronicles a series of emotional highs and lows throughout the year. ... Jewish ritual orients itself to the most highly-charged moments of human existen ce: birth, the passage from childhood to adulthood and responsibility, marriage, and deat h.\" The Jew is taught to see a ll of these in terms of their history of God's interaction with them, thr ough concepts such as the Exodus experience, which has become for them an archtype of tran sformation in much the same way as the Setian would consider an Aeonic Word. An example of this is the sect portrayed in the \"Dybbuk\" tale found in an appendix to the Book of Leviathan by Ipsissimus James Lewis, Grand Mast er of the Order of Leviathan. This sect, in its behavior, is similar to the Hasidic Jews of today. They are characterized by intense emotionalism and drama in even ordinary events , with an extraordinar y devotion in religious matters. It is only in this century that Jewish wo men have once again begun to search for more meaningful and obvious roles within the synagog ue, though they have always had the images of the prophetesses and heroines of the Old Test ament. This is in part due to the cultural milieu in which the Jews must live, wherein th e women of the western world generally have equal access to the same educational, political, and economic roles as men. Some of the discussion in the sour ce text dealt with the shift from a spiritual focus to a much more materialistic and secular Judaism. This was seen as the only way the modern Jew could salvage something from his recent apocalypt ic past. With the shift from prophets to politicians, and the emphasis on a new world order of peace, it will be interesting to watch the birth-pangs of the new Judaism. Behind this shift is the disillusionment eviden ced in Rubenstein's co mments, quoted earlier, which he states go back to the destruction of the Temple. In that he revealed that the Jews also have an aeonic viewpoint. The chaos inherent in modern Judaism leaves the individual Jew torn between the awkward political reality of Israel, the mate rialistic image of the traditional chosen people, and the weariness of looking for the promise, though his blood and traditions still urge him to do so. Partial Summary In this discussion of a simple way to organi ze the data and impressi ons of any religious system using four categories and a basic ques tion, many similarities have been shown, and some interesting authors presented. The purpose once again is to assist the Setian in the delicate process of communication with an unsympathetic audien ce from today's \"traditional\" religions."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"In order to help simplify the assessment process even more fo r the Setian, some keywords come to mind that summarize si mplistically the above discussion. 1. deities : Self feeds the God(s) and feeds upon the God(s). 2. Mysteries : The opium of ecstasy. Pleasure deludes Se lf into seeking stas is. The periods of ecstatic experience are brief no matter how long they last. Rationality is suspended to believe this is the goal to be sought. 3. Initiatory states : Readying the Victim. Self becomes mo re enmeshed in the God's feeding cycle. 4. Mythology : Passing on the sentence to one's children. It is hoped that Setians will be able to compare the Temple of Set's esoteric system with that of other religions, using the f our categories and the basic qu estion, to clearly identify the differences. Here follows a not all-inclusive summary... Setianism 1. deities : The closest contact noted with Set within the Temple literature reminds one of the words of Martin Buber in th e I-Thou commentary in the part on Judaism. When the Setian encounters Set, it is the mee ting of two entities who can co mpletely experience each other without losing the uniqu eness of each other . The God Set lives. But the God Self does likewise, and if Self continues to Realize the Ae onic Words, then in full Realization he will be like unto Set a God-form in the universe he ha s created, as in the prophecy of the Red Magus in the \"Word of Leviathan.\" 2. Mysteries : These are the concepts we hold sacre d, and which trigger responses in our innermost being. These include the Self, Set an d His various aspects and names, the Black Flame, Setamorphoses, the Aeonic Words, a nd the neters of the various Orders. The Mysteries are not related to the life stages that occur in the physical plane, as we saw in the analysis of all other religions. The mysteries of the Temple of Set are largely of the subjective realm, and utilize the rational and non-rational to access their truth. By this I mean that we not only study everything we can, discuss it, and lear n from each other, but we also value and develop the mystical skills necessary to lear n first hand the truths of these mysteries. As the depths of our sacred literature continue s to be explored, the subject of Mysteries will no doubt expand. This article has been written by an Adept. I do not pretend to know the Mysteries as known and understood by the Higher Initiates. But I do know this, no Setian who understands even in a primitive way the meaning of Set and Self will ever fall prey to the addiction of ecstasy, provided he continues to util ize the Gift of Set, his intelligent life force encountered in ritual as the Black Flame. 3. Initiatory States : To the Setian, these may at first glan ce appear to be the degrees. These however, I believe are but the ou tward recognition in an objective sense of what is developing on the inner. The initiations happen before the recognitions. Each degr ee also is a cumulative symbol of numerous initiations which result in Self moving significantly in response to the subjective reality experienced as Set and the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"That the higher degrees are recognition by the Council of Nine is a rational safeguard to protect the objective purity of the Temple of Set. The responsibility, the truth of each initiation, lies only with the individual. 4. Mythology : The mythology of the Temple of Set is as varied as the individual Setians who bring their own preferences or develop unique e xpressions of the Mysteries. This is the area of diversity that really is not as chaotic as may initially a ppear to the new Setian, observing the various Orders and Pylons and yet more i ndividuality within each of them. If this is approached with the key Mysteries in mind, the blur of archetypes will come into focus. For example: how does the mythology of the vampyr e assist in the understa nding of Self? It is the antithesis of the deities described previous ly. In all of these othe r religions, the deities absorbed the individual either in this life, the next, or both, or in the case of Judaism, prescribed a lifestyle outside of the intellect wh ich needed to be adhered to \"for the sake of optimum productivity or harmony in the present life.\" The vampyre however nourishes its life source on its own terms. It is self-motivated, a nd takes what it needs from where it pleases, and is beholden to none. Self does not feed the Gods as a Setian. The basic question: \"What happens to the individu al in this religious system?\" does not have to be asked in comparing the Setian frame of re ference to the pagan. All Gods are false except the Self. Once Self realization has been ac knowledged as the purpose of religion, the Gods become peers in the adventure of eternal life. Set is not only Lord addressed from the upright position, not from bended knee, but Set is also Friend. Xeper and Remanifest!

The FBI Behavioral Science Unit pr ovides assistance to criminal justice professionals in the United States and foreign countries. It attempts to develop practical applications of the behavioral sciences to the criminal justice system. As a result of training and research conducted by the Unit and its su ccesses in analyzing violent crime, many professionals contact the Behavi oral Science Unit for assistan ce and guidance in dealing with violent crime, especially those cases considered different, unusual, or bi zarre. This service is provided at no cost and is not limited to crimes u nder the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI. In 1983 and 1984, when I first began to hear st ories of what sounded like satanic or occult activity in connection with allegations of sexua l victimization of children (allegations that have come to be referred to most often as \"r itual\" child abuse), I tended to believe them. I had been dealing with bizarre, deviant behavior fo r many years and had long since realized that almost anything is possible. Just when you think that you have heard it all, along comes another strange case. The idea that there are a few cunning, secretive individuals in positions of power somewhere in this country regularly killing a few people as part of some satanic ritual or ceremony and getting away with it is certainl y within the realm of possibility. But the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"number of alleged cases began to grow and grow. We now have hundreds of victims alleging that thousands of offenders ar e abusing and even murdering te ns of thousands of people as part of organized satanic cults, and there is little or no corroborative evidence. The very reason many \"experts\" cite for believing these allegations (i.e. many vi ctims, who never met each other, reporting the same events), is the pr imary reason I began to question at least some aspects of these allegations. I have devoted more than seven years part-t ime, and eleven year s full-time, of my professional life to researching, training, and cons ulting in the area of the sexual victimization of children. The issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation are a big pa rt of my professional life's work. I have no reason to deny their existen ce or nature. In fact I have done everything I can to make people more aware of the problem Some have even blamed me for helping to create the hysteria that has led to these biza rre allegations. I can accept no outside income and am paid the same salary by the FBI whether or not children are abused and exploited -- and whether the number is one or one million. As someone deeply concerned about and professionally committed to the issue, I did not lightly question the allegations of hundreds of victims child sexual abuse and exploitation. In response to accusations by a few that I am a \"satanist\" who has in filtrated the FBI to facilitate cover-up, how does a nyone (or should anyone have to) disprove such allegations? Although reluctant to dignify such absurd accusati ons with a reply, all I can say to those who have made such allegations that they are wrong and to those who heard such allegations is to carefully consider the source. The reason I have taken the position I have is not because I support or believe in \"satanism\", but because I sincerely believe th at my approach is the proper and most effective investigative strategy. I believe that my approach is in the best interest of victims of child sexual abuse. It would have been easy to sit back, as ma ny have, and say nothing publicly about this controversy. I have spoken out and published on this issue because I am concerned about the credibility of the child sexual abuse issue and outraged that, in some cases, individuals are getting away with molesting children because we can't prove they are satanic devil worshippers who engage in brainwashing, human s acrifice, and cannibalism as part of a large conspiracy. There are many valid perspectives from which to assess and evaluate vict im allegations of sex abuse and exploitation. Parents may choose to be lieve simply because their children make the claims. The level of proof necessary may be mi nimal because the consequences of believing are within the family. One parent correctly told me, \"I believe what my child needs me to believe.\" Therapists may choose to believe simply because their professional asse ssment is that their patient believes the victimization and describes it so vividly. The level of proof necessary may be no more than therapeutic evaluation because the consequences are between therapist and patient. No independent corr oboration may be required. A social worker must have more real, tangible evidence of abuse in or der to take protective action and initiate legal proceedings. The level of proof necessary must be higher because the consequences (denial of visitati on, foster care) are greater."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The law enforcement officer deals with the criminal justice system. The levels of proof necessary are reasonable suspicion, probable cause, and beyond a reasonable doubt because the consequences (criminal investigation, search and seizure, arrest, incarceration) are so great. This discussion will focus primarily on the criminal justice system and the law enforcement perspective. The level of proof necessary for taking action on allegations of criminal acts must be more than simply the vi ctim alleged it and it is possible. This in no way denies the validity and importance of the parent al, therapeutic, social welfare, or any other perspective of these allegations. When, however, therapists and other professiona ls begin to conduct trai ning, publish articles, and communicate through the media, the conse quences become greater, and therefore the level of proof must be greater. The amount of corroboration necessary to act upon allegations of abuse is dependent upon the consequences of such action. We need to be concerned about the distribution and publication of unsubstant iated allegations of bizarre sexual abuse. Information needs to be disseminated to en courage communication and research about the phenomena. The risks, however, of intervenor and victim \"contagion\" and public hysteria are potential negative aspects of such dissemina tion. Because of the highly emotional and religious nature of this topic, there is a greater possibility th at the spreading of information will result in a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy. If such extreme allegations are going to be diss eminated to the general public, they must be presented in the context of being assessed a nd evaluated, at least, from the professional perspective of the disseminator and, at best, also from the professional perspective of relevant others. This is what I will attempt to do in this discussion. The assessment and evaluation of such allegations are areas where law enforcem ent, mental health, a nd other professionals (anthropologists, folklorists, so ciologists, historians , engineers, surgeons, etc.) may be of some assistance to each other in validating these cases individually and in general. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW In order to attempt to deal with extreme allegations of what constitute child sex rings, it is important to have an historical perspective of society's attitudes about child sexual abuse. I will provide a brief synopsis of recent attitudes in the United States here, but those desiring more detailed information about such societal at titudes, particularly in other cultures and in the more distant past, should refer to Florence Rush's book The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children (1980) and Sander J. Breiner' s book Slaughter of the Innocents (1990). Society's attitude about child sexual abuse a nd exploitation can be summed up in one word: denial . Most people do not want to h ear about it and would prefer to pretend that child sexual victimization just does not occur. Today, howev er, it is difficult to pretend that it does not happen. Stories and reports about child sexua l victimization are daily occurrences. It is important for professionals dealing with child sexual abuse to recognize and learn to manage this denial of a serious problem. Professionals must overcome the denial and encourage society to deal with, report, a nd prevent sexual victimization of children. Some professionals, however, in their zeal to make American society more aware of this victimization, tend to exaggera te the problem. Presentations and literature with poorly documented or misleading claims about one in three children being sexually molested, the $5 billion child pornography indus try, child slavery rings, and 50,000 stranger-abducted children"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"are not uncommon. The problem is bad enough; it is not necessary to exaggerate it. Professionals should cite reputab le and scientific studies and note the sources of information. If they do not, when the exaggerations and dist ortions are discovered, th eir credibility and the credibility of the issue are lost. \"Stranger Danger\" During the 1950s and 1960s the primary focus in the literature and discussions on sexual abuse of children was on \"stranger danger\" -- th e dirty old man in the wrinkled raincoat. If one could not deny the existence of child se xual abuse, one described victimization in simplistic terms of good and evil. The \"stranger danger\" approach to preventing child sexual abuse is clear-cut. We immediately know who the good guys and bad guys are and what they look like. The FBI distributed a poster that epitomized this attitude. It showed a man, with his hat pulled down, hiding behind a tree with a bag of candy in his hands. He was waiting for a sweet little girl walking home from school alone. At the top it read: \"Boys and Girls, color the page, memorize the rules.\" At the botto m it read: \"For your protection, remember to turn down gifts from strangers, and refuse rides offered by strang ers.\" The poster clearly contrasts the evil of the offender with the goodne ss of the child victim. The myth of the child molester as the dirty ol d man in the wrinkled raincoat is now being reevaluated, based on what we now know about the kinds of people who victimize children. The fact is a child molester can look like anyone else and even be someone we know and like. There is another myth that is still with us and is far less likely to be discussed. This is the myth of the child victim as a completely i nnocent little girl walking down the street minding her own business. It may be more important to dispel this myth than the myth of the evil offender, especially when talking about the sexu al exploitation of child ren and child sex rings. Child victims can be boys as well as girls, and not all victims are little \"angels.\" Society seems to have a problem dealing with any sexual abuse case in which the offender is not completely \"bad\" or the victim is not co mpletely \"good.\" Child victims who, for example, simply behave like human beings and respond to the attention and aff ection of offenders by voluntarily and repeatedly returning to the offende r's home are troubling. It confuses us to see the victims in child pornogra phy giggling or laughi ng. At professional conferences on child sexual abuse, child prostitution is almost never discussed. It is the form of sexual victimization of children most unlike the ster eotype of the innocent girl victim. Child prostitutes, by definition, participate in and of ten initiate their vic timization. Furthermore child prostitutes and the participants in chil d sex rings are frequently boys. One therapist recently told me that a researcher's data on child molestation were misleading because many of the child victims in question were child pros titutes. This implies that child prostitutes are not \"real\" child victims. In a survey by the Los Angeles Times , only 37 percent of those responding thought that child pr ostitution constituted child sexual abuse (Timnik, 1985). Whether or not it seems fair, when adults and children have sex, the child is always the victim."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Intrafamilial Child Sexual Abuse During the 1970s, primarily as a result of the women's movement, society began to learn more about the sexual victimization of children. We be gan to realize that mo st children are sexually molested by someone they know who is usually a relative -- a father, step-father, uncle, grandfather, older brother, or even a female re lative. Some mitigate the difficulty of accepting this by adopting the view that only members of socio-economic groups other than theirs engage in such behavior. It quickly became apparent that warnings about not taking gifts from strangers were not good enough to prevent child sexual abuse. Consequently, we be gan to develop prevention programs based on more complex concepts, such as good touching and bad touching. the \"yucky\" feeling, and the child's right to say no. These are not the kinds of things you can easily and effectively communicate in fifty minutes to hundreds of kids packed into a school auditorium. These are very difficult issues, a nd programs must he carefully developed and evaluated. In the late 1970s child sexual abuse became al most synonymous with incest, and incest meant father-daughter sexual relations . Therefore, the focus of ch ild sexual abuse intervention became father-daughter incest. Even today, the va st majority of traini ng materials, articles, and books on this topic refer to child sexual abuse only in terms of intrafamilial father- daughter incest. Incest is, in fact, sexual relations between individuals of any age too closely related to marry. It need not necessarily involve an adult and a child, a nd it goes beyond child sexual abuse. But more importantly child sexual abuse goes beyond father-daughter incest. Intrafamilial incest between an adult and child may be the mo st common form of child sexual abuse, but it is not the only form. The progress of the 1970s in rec ognizing that child se xual abuse was not simply a result of \"stranger danger\" was an important breakthrough in dealing with society's denial. The battle, however, is not over. The persis tent voice of society luring us back to the more simple concept of \"stranger danger\" may never go away. It is the voice of denial. Return to \"Stranger Danger\" In the early 1980s the issue of missing children rose to prominence and was focused primarily on the stranger abduction of little children. Runaways, throwaways, noncustodial abductions, nonfamily abductions of teenagers -- all major pr oblems within the missing children's issue -- were almost forgotten. People no longer wanted to hear about good touching and bad touching and the child's right to say \"no.\" They wanted to be told, in thirty mi nutes or less, how they could protect their children from abduction by st rangers. We were back to the horrible but simple and clear-cut concep t of \"stranger danger.\" In the emotional zeal over the problem of missing children, isolated horror stories and distorted numbers were sometimes used. The Amer ican public was led to believe that most of the missing children had been kidnapped by pedophiles -- a new term for child molesters . The media, profiteers, and well- intentioned zealots all played big roles in this hype and hysteria over missing children."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Acquaintance Molester Only recently has society begun to deal openly with a critical piece in the puzzle of child sexual abuse -- acquaintance molestation. This s eems to be the most difficult aspect of the problem for us to face. People seem more willing to accept a father or stepfather, particularly one from another socio-economic group, as a child molester than a parish priest, a next-door neighbor, a police officer, a pediatrician, an FB I agent, or a Scout le ader. The acquaintance molester, by definition, is one of us. These ki nds of molesters have always existed, but our society has not been wil ling to accept that fact. Sadly, one of the main reasons that the criminal justice system and the public were forced to confront the problem of acquaintance molestat ion was the preponderance of lawsuits arising from the negligence of many institutions. One of the unfortunate outcomes of society's preference for the \"stranger danger\" concept is what I call \"say no, yell, and tell\" guilt. This is the result of prevention programs that tell potential child victims to avoid sexual abus e by saying no, yelling, and telling. This might work with the stranger hidi ng behind a tree. Adolescent boys seduced by a Scout leader or children who actively participate in their victim ization often feel guilty and blame themselves because they did not do what they were \"suppose d\" to do. They may feel a need to describe their victimization in more so cially acceptable but sometimes inaccurate ways that relieve them of this guilt. While American society has become increasi ngly more aware of the problem of the acquaintance molester and rela ted problems such as child pornography, the voice calling us back to \"stranger dange r\" still persists. Satanism: A \"New\" Form of \"Stranger Danger\" In today's version of \"stranger danger\", it is the satanic devil worshipers who are snatching and victimizing the children. Many who warn ed us in the early 1980s about pedophiles snatching fifty thousand kids a year now contend they were wrong only about who was doing the kidnapping, not about the number abducted. This is again the desire for the simple and clear-cut explanation for a complex problem. For those who know anything about criminology, one of the oldest theories of crime is demonology: The devil makes you do it. This make s it even easier to deal with the child molester who is the \"pillar of th e community.\" It is not his fault; it is not our fault. There is no way we could have known; the devil made him do it. This explanation has tremendous appeal because, like \"stranger danger\", it presents th e clear-cut, black-and- white struggle between good and evil as the explanation for child abduction, exploitation, and abuse. In regard to satanic \"ritual\" a buse, today we may not be where we were with incest in the 1960s, but where we were with missing childr en in the early 1980s. The best data now available (the 1990 National Incidence St udies on Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children in America ) estimate the number of stereo typical child abductions at between 200 and 300 a year, and the number of stranger abduc tion homicides of children at between 43 and 147 a year. Approximately half of the abducted children are teenagers. Today's facts are significantly different fr om yesterday's perceptions, and those who"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"exaggerated the problem, however well-intenti oned, have lost credib ility and damaged the reality of the problem. Law Enforcement Training The belief that there is a connection between sa tanism and crime is certainly not new. As previously stated, one of the oldest theories concerning the causes of crime is demonology. Fear of satanic or occult ac tivity has peaked from time to time throughout history. Concern in the late 1970s focused primarily on \"unexplained\" deaths and mutilations of animals, and in recent years has focused on child sexual abus e and the alleged human sacrifice of missing children. In 1999 it will probably focus on the impending \"end of the world.\" Today satanism and a wide variety of other te rms are used interchangeably in reference to certain crimes. This discussion will analyze the nature of \"satanic, occult, ritualistic\" crime primarily as it pertains to the abus e of children and focus on appropriate law enforcement responses to it. Recently a flood of law enforcement seminars a nd conferences have dealt with satanic and ritualistic crime. These training conferences ha ve various titles, such as \"Occult in Crime\", \"Satanic Cults\", \"Ritualistic Crime Seminar\", \"Satanic Influences in Homicide\", \"Occult Crimes, Satanism and Teen Suicide\", and \"Ritualistic Abuse of Children.\" The typical conference runs from one to thr ee days, and many of them include the same presenters and instructors. A wi de variety of topics are usually discussed during this training either as individual presentati ons by different instructors or grouped together by one or more instructors. Typical topics c overed include the following: • Historical overview of satanism, witchcra ft, and paganism from ancient to modern times. • Nature and influence of fantasy role-playi ng games, such as \"Dungeons and Dragons.\" • Lyrics, symbolism, and influence of rock and roll, Heavy Metal, and Black Metal music. • Teenage \"stoner\" gangs, their sy mbols, and their vandalism. • Teenage suicide by adolescents dabbling in the occult. • Crimes committed by self-styled satanic pr actitioners, including grave and church desecrations and robberies, animal mutilations, and even murders. • Ritualistic abuse of children as part of bizarre cerem onies and human sacrifices. • Organized, Traditional, or Multigenerati onal satanic groups i nvolved in organized conspiracies, such as taking over day care ce nters, infiltrating police departments, and trafficking in human sacrifice victims. • The \"Big Conspiracy\" theory, which implies that satanists are responsible for such things as Adolph Hitler, World War II, abortion, illegal drugs, pornography, Watergate, and Irangate, and have infiltrate d the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, and the White House. During the conferences, these nine areas are lin ked together through th e liberal use of the word \"satanism\" and some common symbo lism (pentagrams, 666, demons, etc.). The implication often is that all are part of a c ontinuum of behavior, a si ngle problem or some common conspiracy. The distinctions among th e different areas are blurred even if occasionally a presenter tries to make them. The information presented is a mixture of fact,"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"theory, opinion, fantasy, and paranoia, and because some of it can be proven or corroborated (symbols on rock albums, graffiti on walls, desecration of cemeteries, vandalism, etc.), the implication is that it is all true and document ed. Material produced by religious organizations, photocopies and slides of newspa per articles, and videotapes of tabloid television programs are used to supplement the training and are pr esented as \"evidence\" of the existence and nature of the problem. All of this is complicated by the fact that almo st any discussion of satanism and the occult is interpreted in the light of the religious belief s of those in the audien ce. Faith, not logic and reason, governs the religious belief s of most people. As a result, some normally skeptical law enforcement officers accept the information disseminated at these conferences without critically evaluating it or questioning the sources. Officers who do not normally depend on church groups for law enforcement criminal intelligence, who know that media accounts of their own cases are notoriously inaccurate, and who scoff at a nd joke about tabloid television accounts of bizarre behavior suddenly embrace such material when presented in the context of satanic activity. Individuals not in law enforcement seem even more likely to do so. Other disciplines, especially therap ists, have also conducted training conferences on the characteristics and identification of \"ritual\" child abuse. Nothing said at such conferences will change the religious beliefs of those in attenda nce. Such conferences illustrate the highly emotional nature of and the ambiguity and wide variety of terms involved in this issue. Definitions The words \"satanic\", \"occult\", and \"ritual\" are of ten used interchangeably. It is difficult to define \"satanism\" precisely. No attempt will be ma de to do so here However, it is important to realize that, for some people, a ny religious belief system other th an their own is \"satanic.\" The Ayatollah Khomeini and Saddam Hussein referred to the United States as the \"Great Satan.\" In the British Parliament a Protestant leader called the Pope the Antic hrist. In a book titled Prepare For War (1987), Rebecca Brown, M.D. has a chap ter entitled \"Is Roman Catholicism Witchcraft?\" Dr. Brown also lists among the \"doorways\" to satanic power and/or demon infestation the following: fortune tellers, horos copes, fraternity oaths, vegetarianism, yoga, self-hypnosis, relaxation tapes, acupuncture , biofeedback, fantasy role-playing games, adultery, homosexuality, pornography, judo, karate, and rock music. Dr. Brown states that rock music \"was a carefully masterminded plan by none other than Satan himself\" (p. 84). The ideas expressed in this book may seem ex treme and even humorous. This book, however, has been recommended as a seri ous reference in law enforcement training material on this topic. In books, lectures, handout material, and conve rsations, I have heard all of the following referred to as satanism: • Church of Satan • Ordo Templi Orientis • Temple of Set • Demonology • Witchcraft • Occult • Paganism • Santeria • Voodoo"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"• Rosicrucians • Freemasonry • Knights Templar • Stoner Gangs • Heavy Metal Music • Rock Music • KKK • Nazis • Skinheads • Scientology • Unification Church • The Way • Hare Krishna • Rajneesh • Religious Cults • New Age • Astrology • Channeling • Transcendental Meditation • Holistic Medicine • Buddhism • Hinduism • Mormonism • Islam • Orthodox Church • Roman Catholicism At law enforcement training conferences, it is witchcraft, santeria, paganism, and the occult that are most often referred to as forms of sata nism. It may be a matter of definition, but these things are not necessarily the same as trad itional satanism. The worship of lunar goddesses and nature and the practice of fe rtility rituals are not satanism. Santeria is a combination of 17th century Roman Catholicis m and African paganism. Occult means simply \"hidden.\" All unreported or unsolved crimes might be regarded as occult, but in this context the term refers to the action or influence of supernatural powers, some secret knowledge of them, or an intere st in paranormal phenomena, and does not imply satanism, evil, wrongdoing, or crime. Indeed, hist orically, the principal crimes deserving of consideration as \"occult crimes\" are the frauds pe rpetrated by faith healers, fortune tellers and \"psychics\" who for a fee claim cures, arrange visitations with dead loved ones, and commit other financial crimes against the gullible. Many individuals define satanism from a totally Christian pers pective, using this word to describe the power of evil in the world. With this definition, any crimes, especially those which are particularly bizarre, repulsive, or cruel, can be viewed as satanic in nature. Yet it is just as difficult to precisely define satanism as it is to precisely define Christianity or any complex spiritual belief system."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"What is Ritual? The biggest confusion is over th e word \"ritual.\" During training conferences on this topic, ritual almost always comes to mean \"satanic\" or at least \"spiritual.\" \"Ritual\" can refer to a prescribed religious ce remony, but in its broader meaning re fers to any customarily-repeated act or series of acts. The need to repeat these acts can be cultural, sexu al, or psychological as well as spiritual. Cultural rituals could include such things as what a family eats on Thanksgiving Day, or when and how presents are opened at Christmas. The initiation ceremonies of fraternities, sororities, gangs, and other social clubs are other examples of cultural rituals. Since 1972 I have lectured about sexual ritual , which is nothing more than repeatedly engaging in an act or series of act s in a certain manner because of a sexual need. In order to become aroused and/or gratified, a person must e ngage in the act in a certain way. This sexual ritual can include such things as the physical characteristics, age, or gender of the victim, the particular sequence of acts, the bringing or taki ng of specific objects, and the use of certain words or phrases. This is more than the con cept of M.O. (Method of Operation) known to most police officers. M.O. is something done by an offender because it works. Sexual ritual is something done by an offender because of a ne ed. Deviant acts, such as urinating on, defecating on, or even eviscerating a victim, are fa r more likely to be the result of sexual ritual than religious or \"satanic\" ritual. From a criminal investigative pe rspective, two other forms of ritualism must be recognized. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) (APA, 1987) defines \"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\" as \"repetitive, purposeful, a nd intentional behaviors that are performed in response to an obsession, or according to cert ain rules or in a stereotyped fashion\" (p. 247). Such compul sive behavior frequently i nvolves rituals. Although such behavior usually involves noncriminal activity such as excessive hand washing or checking that doors are locked, occasionally compulsive ritualism can be part of criminal activity. Certain gamblers or firesetters, for example, are thought by some authorities to be motivated in part through such compulsions. Ritual can also stem from psychotic hallucinations and delusions. A crime can be committed in a precise manner because a voice told the offender to do it that way or because a divine mission required it. To make this more confusing, cultural, religi ous, sexual, and psychologi cal ritual can overlap. Some psychotic people are preoccupied with re ligious delusions and h ear the voice of God or Satan telling them to do things of a religious nature. Offenders who feel little, if any, guilt over their crimes may need little justification for their antisocial beha vior. As human beings, however, they may have fears, concerns, and an xiety over getting away with their criminal acts. It is difficult to pray to God for success in doing things that are against His Commandments. A negative spiritual belief system may fulfill their human need for assistance from and belief in a greater power or to deal with their superstitions. Compulsive ritualism (e.g., excessive cleanlin ess or fear of disease) can be introduced into sexual behavior. Even many \"normal\" people have a need for order and predicta bility and therefore may engage in family or work rituals. Under stre ss or in times of change, this need for order and ritual may increase. Ritual crime may fulfill the cultural, spiritual, sexual, and psychological needs of an offender. Crimes may be ritualistically motivated or may have ritualistic elements. The ritual behavior"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"may also fulfill basic criminal needs to manipulate victims, get rid of rivals, send a message to enemies, and intimidate co-conspirators. The l eaders of a group may want to play upon the beliefs and superstitions of those around them and try to convince ac complices and enemies that they, the leaders, have sp ecial or \"supernatural\" powers. The important point for the criminal investigator is to realize that most ritualistic criminal behavior is not motivated si mply by satanic or any religious ceremonies. At some conferences, presenters have attempted to make an issue of distinguishing between \"ritual\", \"ritualized\", and \"ritualistic\" abus e of children. These subtle dis tinctions, however, seem to be of no significant value to th e criminal investigator. What is \"Ritual\" Child Abuse? I cannot define \"ritual child abus e\" precisely and pref er not to use the term. I am frequently forced to use it (as throughout this discussion) so that people will have some idea what I am discussing. Use of the term, however, is c onfusing, misleading, and counterproductive. The newer term \"satanic ritual abuse\" (abbreviate d \"SRA\") is even worse. Certain observations, however, are important for investigative understanding. Most people today use the term to refer to abuse of children that is part of some evil spiritual belief system, which almost by de finition must be satanic. Dr. Lawrence Pazder, coauthor of Michelle Remembers , defines \"ritualized abuse of children\" as \"repeated physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual assaults combined with a systematic use of symbols and secret ceremonies designed to turn a child against itself, family, society, and God\" (presentation, Richmond, Va., May 7,1987). He also states that \"the sexual assault has ritualistic meaning and is not for sexual gratification.\" This definition may have value for academics, sociologists, and ther apists, but it creates potential problems for law enforcement. Certai n acts engaged in with children (i.e. kissing, touching, appearing naked, etc.) may be criminal if performed for sexual gratification. If the ritualistic acts were in fact performed for spiritual indoctrina tion, potential prosecution can be jeopardized, particularly if th e acts can be defended as const itutionally protected religious expression. The mutilation of a baby's genitals for sadistic sexual pleasure is a crime. The circumcision of a baby's genitals fo r religious reasons is most likely not a crime. The intent of the acts is important for criminal prosecution. Not all spiritually motivated r itualistic activity is satanic. Santeria, witchcraft, voodoo, and most religious cults are not sata nism. In fact, most spiritually -or religiously-based abuse of children has nothing to do with satanism. Most child abuse that could be termed \"ritualistic\" by various definitions is more likely to be physic al and psychological rather than sexual in nature. If a distincti on needs to be made between satani c and nonsatanic child abuse, the indicators for that distinction mu st be related to specific satanic symbols, artifacts, or doctrine rather than the mere presence of any ritualistic element. Not all such ritualistic activity w ith a child is a crime. Almost a ll parents with religious beliefs indoctrinate their children into that belief system. Is male ci rcumcision for religious reasons child abuse? Is the religious circumcision of females child abuse? Does having a child kneel on a hard floor reciting the rosary constitute child abuse? Does having a child chant a satanic prayer or attend a black mass constitute child ab use? Does a religious belief in corporal"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"punishment constitute child abuse? Does gr oup care of children in a commune or cult constitute child abuse? Does the fact that any acts in question were pe rformed with parental permission affect the nature of the crime? Ma ny ritualistic acts, whether satanic or not, are simply not crimes. To open the Pandora's box of labeling child abuse as \"ritualistic\" simply because it involves a spiritual belief system m eans to apply the definition to all acts by all spiritual belief systems. The day may come wh en many in the forefront of concern about ritual abuse will regret they opened the box. When a victim describes and investigation corro borates what sounds like ritualistic activity. several possibilities must be considered. The ri tualistic activity may be part of the excessive religiosity of mentally disturbe d, even psychotic offenders. It ma y be a misunderstood part of sexual ritual. The ritualistic activity may be inci dental to any real abus e. The offender may be involved in ritualistic activity with a child and also may be a busing a child, but one may have little or nothing to do with the other. The offender may be deliberately engaging in ritua listic activity with a ch ild as part of child abuse and exploitation. The motivation, however, ma y be not to indoctrinate the child into a belief system, but to lower the inhibitions of, c ontrol, manipulate, and/or confuse the child. In all the turmoil over this issue, it would be ve ry effective strategy for any child molester deliberately to introduce ritualisti c elements into his crime in order to confuse the child and therefore the criminal justice system. This would, however, make the activity M.O. and not ritual. The ritualistic activity and the child abuse may be integral parts of some spiritual belief system. In that case the greatest ri sk is to the children of the pract itioners. But this is true of all cults and religions, not just satanic cults. A high potential of abuse exists for any children raised in a group isolated from the mainstr eam of society, especially if the group has a charismatic leader whose orders are unquestio ned and blindly obeyed by the members. Sex, money, and power are often the main motiva tions of the leaders of such cults. What Makes a Crime Satanic, Occult, or Ritualistic? Some would answer that it is the offender's spiritu al beliefs or membership in a cult or church. If that is the criterion, why not label the crim es committed by Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in the same way? Are the atrocities of Jim Jones in Guyana Christian crimes? Some would answer that it is th e presence of certain symbols in the possession or home of the perpetrator. What does it mean then to find a cr ucifix, Bible, or rosary in the possession or home of a bank robber, embezzler, child molester , or murderer? If different criminals possess the same symbols, are they necessarily part of one big conspiracy? Others would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols such as pentagrams, inverted crosses, and 666 at the crime scene. What does it mean then to find a cross spray painted on a wall or carved into the body of a victim? What does it mean for a perpetrator, as in one recent case profiled by my Unit, to leave a Bible ti ed to his murder victim? What about the possibility that an offender deliberately left such symbols to make it look like a \"satanic\" crime? Some would argue that it is the bizarrene ss or cruelness of the crime: body mutilation, amputation, drinking of blood, eating of flesh, use of urine or feces. Does this mean that all"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"individuals involved in lust murder, sadism, vampirism, cannibalism, urophilia, and coprophilia are satanists or occu lt practitioners? What does this say about the bizarre crimes of psychotic killers such as Ed Gein or Richard Trenton Chase, both of whom mutilated their victims as part of their psychotic delusions? Can a crime that is not sexually deviant, bizarre, or exceptionally violent be satanic? Can white collar crime be satanic? A few might even answer that it is the fact that the crime was committed on a date with satanic or occult significance (Halloween, May Ev e, etc.) or the fact that the perpetrator claims that Satan told him to commit the crime. What does this mean for crimes committed on Thanksgiving or Christmas? What does this say about crimes committed by perpetrators who claim that God or Jesus told them to do it? One no te of interest is the f act that in handout and reference material I have collected, the number of dates with satanic or occult significance ranges from 8 to 110. This is compounded by the fact that it is sometimes stated that satanists can celebrate these holidays on seve ral days on either side of th e official date or that the birthdays of practitioners can also be holidays. The exact names and exact dates of the holidays and the meaning of symbols listed ma y also vary depending on who prepared the material The handout material is often dist ributed without identif ying the author or documenting the original source of the informa tion. It is then frequently photocopied by attendees and passed on to othe r police officers with no one r eally knowing its validity or origin. Most, however, would probably answer that what makes a crime satanic, occult, or ritualistic is the motivation for the crime. It is a crime th at is spiritually motivated by a religious belief system. How then do we label the following true crimes? • Parents defy a court order and send their ch ildren to an unlicensed Christian school. • Parents refuse to send their children to a ny school because they are waiting for the second coming of Christ. • Parents beat their child to death because he or she will not follow their Christian belief. • Parents violate child labor laws because th ey believe the Bible requires such work. • Individuals bomb an abortion clinic or kidnap the doctor be cause their religious belief system says abortion is murder. • A child molester reads the Bible to his vic tims in order to justify his sex acts with them. • Parents refuse life-saving medical treatment for a child because of their religious beliefs. • Parents starve and beat their child to deat h because their minister said the child was possessed by demonic spirits. Some people would argue that the Christians who committed the above crimes misunderstood and distorted their religion while satanists w ho commit crimes are following theirs. But who decides what constitutes a misinterpretation of a religious belief system? The individuals who committed the above-described crimes, however misguided, believed that they were following their religion as they un derstood it. Religion was and is used to justify such social behavior as the Crusades, the Inquisition, Apartheid, segregat ion, and recent violen ce in Northern Ireland, India, Lebanon and Nigeria. Who decides exactly what \"satanis ts\" believe? In this country, we cannot even agree on what Christians believe. At many law enforcement conferences The Satanic Bible is used for this,"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"and it is often contrasted or compared with the Judeo-Christian Bible. The Satanic Bible is, in essence, a short paperback book written by one man, Anton LaVey, in 1969. To compare it to a book written by multiple authors over a period of thousands of years is ridiculous, even ignoring the possibility of Divine revelation in the Bible. What satanists believe certainly isn't limited to other people's interpretation of a few books. More importantly it is subject to some degree of interpretation by individual believe rs just as Christianity is. Many admitted \"satanists\" claim they do not even believe in God, the devil, or any supreme deity. The criminal behavior of one person claiming belief in a religion does not necessarily imply guilt or blame to others sharing that belief. In a ddition, simply claiming membership in a religion does not necessarily make you a member. The fact is that far more crime and child a buse has been committed by zealots in the name of God, Jesus, Mohammed, and other mainstream religion than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. Many people, including myself, don't like that statement, but the truth of it is undeniable. Although defining a crime as satanic, occult , or ritualistic woul d probably involve a combination of the criteria set forth above, I have been unable to clearly define such a crime. Each potential definition presents a different set of problems when measured against an objective, rational, and constitutional perspective. In a crime with multiple subjects, each offender may have a different motivation for th e same crime. Whose motivation determines the label for the crime? It is difficult to c ount or track something you cannot even define. I have discovered, however, that the facts of so -called \"satanic crimes \" are often significantly different from what is desc ribed at training conferences or in the media. The actual involvement of satanism or the occult in th ese cases usually turns out to be secondary, insignificant, or nonexistent. Occult or ritual crime surveys done by the states of Michigan (1990) and Virginia (1991) have only confirme d this \"discovery.\" Some law enforcement officers, unable to find serious \"satanic\" crime in their communities, assume they are just lucky or vigilant and the serious problems must be in other ju risdictions. The officers in the other jurisdictions, also unabl e find it, assume the same. Multidimensional Child Sex Rings Sometime in early 1983 I was first contacted by a law enforcement agency for guidance in what was then thought to be an unusual case. The exact date of the contact is unknown b ecause its significance was not recognized at the time. In the months and years that followed, I received more and more inquiries a bout \"these kinds of cases.\" The requests for assistance came (and continue to come) from all over the United States. Many of the aspects of these cases varied, but there were also some commonalties. Early on, however, one particular ly difficult and potentially signi ficant issue began to emerge. These cases involved and continue to involve unsubstantiated a llegations of bizarre activity that are difficult either to prove or dispr ove. Many of the unsubstantiated allegations, however, do not seem to have occurred or even be possible. These cases seem to call into question the credibility of vic tims of child sexual abuse and e xploitation. These are the most polarizing, frustrating, and baffling cases I ha ve encountered in more than 18 years of studying the criminal aspects of deviant sexual be havior. I privately soug ht answers, but said nothing publicly about those cases until 1985. In October 1984 the problems in investigating and prosecuting one of these cases in Jordan, Minnesota became publicly known. In February 1985, at the FBI Academy, the FBI"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"sponsored and I coordinated the first national se minar held to study \"these kinds of cases.\" Later in 1985, similar conferences sponsored by other organizations were held in Washington, D.C.; Sacramento, California; a nd Chicago, Illinois. These cases have also been discussed at many recent regional and national conferences dealing with the sexual victimization of children and Multiple Personality Disorder. Few answers have come from these conferences. I continue to be contacted on thes e cases on a regular basis. Inquiries have been received from law enforcement officers, prosecutors, therapists, victims, families of victims, and the media from all over the United States and now fore ign countries. I do not claim to understand completely all the dynamics of th ese cases. I continue to keep an open mind and to search for answers to the questions and solutions to the pr oblems they pose. This discussion is based on my analysis of the several hundred of \"these ki nds of cases\" on which I have consulted since 1983. Dynamics of Cases What are \"these kinds of cases\"? They were and continue to be difficult to define. They all involve allegations of what sounds like child se xual abuse, but with a combination of some atypical dynamics. These cases seem to have the following four dynamics in common: (1) multiple young victims, (2) multiple offenders, (3) fear as the controlling tactic, and (4) bizarre or ritualistic activity. Multiple Young Victims : In almost all the cases the sexual abuse was alleged to have taken place or at least begun when the victims were be tween the ages of birth and six. This very young age may be an important key to understandi ng these cases. In addition the victims all described multiple children being abused. The numbers ranged from three or four to as many as several hundred victims. Multiple Offenders : In almost all the cases the vict ims reported numerous offenders. The numbers ranged from two or three all the way up to dozens of offenders. In one recent case the victims alleged 400-500 offenders were i nvolved. Interestingly many of the offenders (perhaps as many as 40-50 percent) were reporte d to be females. The multiple offenders were often family members and were described as bein g part of a cult, occult, or satanic group. Fear as Controlling Tactic : Child molesters in general are able to maintain control and ensure the secrecy of their vict ims in a variety of ways. These include attention and affection, coercion, blackmail, embarrassment, threats, and vi olence. In almost all of these cases I have studied, the victims described be ing frightened and reported threats against themselves, their families, their friends, and even their pets. They reported witnessing acts of violence perpetrated to reinforce this fear. It is my belie f that this fear and the traumatic memory of the events may be another key to understanding many of these cases. Bizarre or Ritualistic Activity : This is the most difficult dynamic of these cases to describe. \"Bizarre\" is a relative te rm. Is the use of urine or feces in sexual activity bizarre, or is it a well-documented aspect of sexual deviancy, or is it part of es tablished satanic rituals? As previously discussed, the ritual istic aspect is even more difficult to define. How do you distinguish acts performed in a precise manner to enhance or allow sexual arousal from those acts that fulfill spiritual needs or comply with \"religious\" ceremonies? Victims in these cases report ceremonies, chanting, robes and costumes , drugs, use of urine and feces, animal sacrifice, torture, abduction, mutilation, murd er, and even cannibalism and vampirism. All"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"things considered, the word \"bizar re\" is probably preferable to the word \"ritual\" to describe this activity. When I was contacted on these cases, it was ve ry common for a prosecuto r or investigator to say that the alleged victims have been eval uated by an \"expert\" who will stake his or her professional reputation on the fact that the vi ctims are telling the \"t ruth.\" When asked how many cases this expert had previously evalua ted involving these four dynamics, the answer was always the same: none! The experts usually had only dealt with one-on-one intrafamilial sexual abuse cases. Recently an even more dist urbing trend has developed. More and more of the victims have been identified or evaluated by experts who have been trained to identify and specialize in satanic ritual abuse. Characteristics of Multidim ensional Child Sex Rings As previously stated, a major problem in co mmunicating, training, and researching in this area is the term used to define \"these kinds of cases.\" Many refer to them as \"ritual, ritualistic, or ritualized abuse of children cases\" or \"satanic ritual abuse (SRA) cases.\" Such words carry specialized meanings for many pe ople and might imply that all these cases are connected to occult or satanic activity. If ritu al abuse is not necessarily occu lt or satanic, but is \"merely\" severe, repeated, prolonged abuse, why use a term that, in the minds of so many, implies such specific motivation? Others refer to these cases as \"multioffender/mu ltivictim cases.\" The problem with this term is that most multiple offender and victim cases do not involve the four dynamics discussed above. For want of a better term, I have decide d to refer to \"these kinds of cases\" as multidimensional child sex rings . Right now I seem to be the only one us ing this term. I am, however, not sure if this is truly a distinct ki nd of child sex ring case or ju st a case not properly handled. Following are the general characteristics of these multidimensional child sex ring cases as contrasted with more common historical ch ild sex ring cases [see my monograph Child Sex Rings: A Behavioral Analysis ] (1989) for a discussion of the ch aracteristics of historical child sex ring cases]. Female Offenders : As many as 40-50 percent of the offende rs in these cases are reported to be women. This is in marked contrast to hist orical child sex rings in which almost all the offenders are men. Situational Molesters : The offenders appear to be sexuall y interacting with the child victims for reasons other than a true sexual prefer ence for children. The children are substitute victims, and the abusive activ ity may have little to do w ith pedophilia [see my monograph Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis (1987) for a further expl anation about types of molesters]. Male and Female Victims : Both boys and girls appear to be targeted, but with an apparent preference for girls. Almost all the adult surviv ors are female, but day care cases frequently involve male as well as female victims. The most striking ch aracteristic of the victims, however, is their young age (generally birth to six years old when the abuse began)."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Multidimensional Motivation : Sexual gratification appears to be only part of the motivation for the \"sexual\" activity. Many pe ople today argue that the motiv ation is \"spiritual\" -- possibly part of an occult ceremony. It is my opinion th at the motivation may have more to do with anger, hostility, rage and rese ntment carried out against weak and vulnerable victims. Much of the ritualistic abuse of child ren may not be sexual in nature. Some of the activity may, in fact, be physical abuse directed at sexually-significant body part s (penis, anus, nipples). This may also partially explain the large percentage of female offenders. Physical abuse of children by females is well-documented. Pornography and Paraphernalia : Although many of the victims of multidimensional child sex rings claim that pictures a nd videotapes of the activity were made, no such visual record has been found by law enforcement. In recent years, American law enforcement has seized large amounts of child pornogr aphy portraying children in a wi de variety of sexual activity and perversions. None of it, however, portrays th e kind of bizarre and/or ritualistic activity described by these victims. Perhaps these offenders use and store their pornography and paraphernalia in ways different from preferential child molesters (pedophil es). This is an area needing additional research and investigation. Control Through Fear : Control through fear may be the overriding characteristic of these cases. Control is maintained by frightening th e children. A very young child might not be able to understand the significance of much of the sexual activity but certainly understands fear. The stories that the victims tell may be their pe rceived versions of seve re traumatic memories. They may be the victims of a severely trau matized childhood in which being sexually abused was just one of the many negativ e events affecting their lives. Scenarios Multidimensional child sex rings typically emerge from one of four scenarios: (1) adult survivors, (2) day care cases, (3) fa mily/isolated neighborhood cases, and (4) custody/visitation disputes. In adult survivor cases, adults of almost any age -- nearly always women -- are suffering the consequences of a variety of personal problem s and failures in their lives (e.g., promiscuity, eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, faile d relationships, self-mutilation, unemployment). As a result of some precipitating stress or crisis , they often seek therapy. They are frequently hypnotized, intentionally or unintentionally, as part of the th erapy and are often diagnosed as suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. Gr adually, during the therapy, the adults reveal previously unrecalled memories of early childhood victimization that includes multiple victims and offenders, fear as the controlling t actic, and bizarre or ri tualistic activity. Adult survivors may also claim that \"cues\" from certa in events in their recent life \"triggered\" the previously repressed memories. The multiple offenders are often described as members of a cult or satanic group. Parents, family members, clergy, civic leaders, po lice officers (or individuals wearing police uniforms), and other prominent members of societ y are frequently described as present at and participating in the exploita tion. The alleged bizarre activity often includes insertion of foreign objects, witnessing mutilations, and se xual acts and murders being filmed or photographed. The offenders may allegedly still be harassing or threatening the victims. They report being particularly frighten ed on certain dates and by cert ain situations. In several of these cases, women (called \"breeders\") claim to have had babies that were turned over for"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"human sacrifice. This type of case is pr obably best typified by books like Michelle Remembers (Smith & Pazder, 1980), Satan's Underground (Stratford, 1988), and Satan's Children (Mayer, 1991). If and when therapists come to believe the patie nt or decide the law re quires it, the police or FBI are sometimes contacted to conduct an inve stigation. The therapists may also fear for their safety because they now know the \"secre t.\" The therapists will frequently tell law enforcement that they will stake their professiona l reputation on the fact that their patient is telling the truth. Some adult survivors go directly to law enforcement. They may also go from place to place in an effort to find therapists or investigators who will listen to and believe them. Their ability to provide verifiable detail s varies and many were raised in apparently religious homes. A few adult su rvivors are now reporting particip ation in specific murders or child abductions that are known to have taken place. In day care cases children currently or formerly atte nding a day care center gradually describe their victimization at the cente r and at other locations to wh ich they were taken by the day care staff. The cases include multiple victims an d offenders, fear, and bizarre or ritualistic activity, with a particularly high number of fema le offenders. Descriptions of strange games, insertion of foreign objects, killing of animals, photographing of activities, and wearing of costumes are common. The accounts of the young ch ildren, however, do not seem to be quite as \"bizarre\" as those of the adult survivors, with fewer accounts of human sacrifice. In family/isolated neighborhood cases, children describe their victimization within their family or extended family. The group is often defined by geographic boundary, such as a cul- de-sac, apartment building, or isolated rural setting. Such accounts are most common in rural or suburban communities with hi gh concentrations of religiously conservative people. The stories are similar to those to ld of the day care setting, but w ith more male offenders. The basic dynamics remain the same, but victims tend to be more than six years of age, and the scenario may also involve a cu stody or visitation dispute. In custody/visitation dispute cases, the allegations emanate from a custody or visitation dispute over at least one ch ild under the age of seven. The four dynamics described above make these cases extremely difficult to handle. When complicated by the strong emotions of this scenario, the cases can be overwhelming. This is especially true if the disclosing child victims have been taken into the \"underground\" by a parent during the custody or visitation dispute. Some of these parents or relatives may even provide authorities with diaries or tapes of their interviews with the children. An accu rate evaluation and assessment of a young child held in isolation in this underground while bei ng \"debriefed\" by a parent or someone else is almost impossible. However well-intentioned, th ese self-appointed i nvestigators severely damage any chance to validate these cases objectively. Why Are Victims Alleging Things th at Do Not Seem to Be True? Some of what the victims in th ese cases allege is physically impossible (victim cut up and put back together, offender took the building apart and then rebuilt it); some is possible but improbable (human sacrifice, cannibalism, vampir ism ); some is possible and probable (child pornography, clever manipulation of victims); and some is corroborated (medical evidence of vaginal or anal trauma, offender confessions)."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The most significant crimes being alleged that do not seem to be true are the human sacrifice and cannibalism by organized satanic cults. In none of the multidimensional child sex ring cases of which I am aware have bodies of the murder victims been f ound -- in spite of major excavations where the abuse vic tims claim the bodies were locat ed. The alleged explanations for this include: the offenders moved the bodies af ter the children left, the bodies were burned in portable high-temperature ovens, the bodies were put in double-decker graves under legitimately buried bodies, a mo rtician member of the cult disposed of the bodies in a crematorium, the offenders ate the bodies, the of fenders used corpses and aborted fetuses, or the power of Satan caused the bodies to disappear. Not only are no bodies found, but also, more importa ntly, there is no physical evidence that a murder took place. Many of those not in la w enforcement do not understand that, while it is possible to get rid of a body, it is even more diffi cult to get rid of the physical evidence that a murder took place, especially a human sacr ifice involving sex, blood, and mutilation. Such activity would leave behind trace evidence that could be found using modern crime scene processing techniques in spite of ex traordinary efforts to clean it up. The victims of these human sacrifices and mu rders are alleged to be abducted missing children, runaway and throwaway children, derelict s, and the babies of breeder women. It is interesting to note that many of those espous ing these theories ar e using the long-since- discredited numbers and rhetoric of the mi ssing children hysteria in the early 1980s. Yet Stranger-Abduction Homicides of Children , a January 1989 Juvenile Justice Bulletin , published by the Office of Juvenile Justic e and Delinquency Prevention of the U.S. Department of Justice, reports that researchers now estimate that the number of children kidnapped and murdered by nonfamily members is between 52 and 158 a year and that adolescents 14 to 17 years old account for nearly two-thirds of these victims. These figures are also consistent with the 1990 National Incident Studies previously mentioned. We live in a very violent society, and yet we have \"only\" about 23,000 murders a year. Those who accept these stories of mass hu man sacrifice would have us be lieve that the satanists and other occult practitioners are murdering more than twice as many people every year in this country as all the other murderers combined. In addition, in none of the cases of which I am aware has an y evidence of a well-organized satanic cult been found. Many of those who accept the stories of organized ritual abuse of children and human sacrifice will tell you that the best evidence they now have is the consistency of stories from all over America. It sounds like a powerf ul argument. It is interesting to note that, without having met each other, the hundreds of people who claim to have been abducted by aliens from outer space al so tell stories and give descriptions of the aliens that are similar to each other. This is no t to imply that allegations of child abuse are in the same category as allegations of abduction by aliens from outer space. It is intended only to illustrate that individuals who never met each other can sometimes describe similar events without necessarily having experienced them. The large number of people telli ng the same story is, in fact, the biggest reason to doubt these stories. It is simply too difficult for that many people to commit so many horrendous crimes as part of an organized conspiracy. Two or th ree people murder a couple of children in a few communities as part of a ritual, and nobody finds out? Possible. Thousands of people do the same thing to tens of thousands of vic tims over many years? Not likely. Hundreds of communities all over America are run by mayors, police departments, and community leaders"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"who are practicing satanists and who regularly murder and eat people? Not likely. In addition, these community leaders and high-ranking officials also supposedly commit these complex crimes leaving no evidence, and at the same time function as leaders and managers while heavily involved in using illegal drugs. Probably the closest documented example of this type of alleged activity in American history is the Ku Klux Klan, which ironically used Christianity, not satanism, to rationalize its act ivity but which, as might be expected, was eventually infiltrated by informants and betrayed by its members. As stated, initially I was inclin ed to believe the allegations of the victims. But as the cases poured in and the months and years went by, I became more concerne d about the lack of physical evidence and corroboration for many of th e more serious allegations. With increasing frequency I began to ask the question: \"W hy are victims alleging things that do not seem to be true?\" Many possible answ ers were considered. The first possible answer is obvi ous: clever offenders. The allegations may not seem to be true but they are true. The criminal justice sy stem lacks the knowledge , skill, and motivation to get to the bottom of this cr ime conspiracy. The perpetrators of this crime conspiracy are clever, cunning individuals us ing sophisticated mind control and brainwashing techniques to control their victims. Law enforcement does not know how to invest igate these cases. It is technically possible that these allegations of an orga nized conspiracy involving taking over day care centers, abduction, ca nnibalism, murder, and human sacrifice might be true. But if they are true, they constitute one of the greatest crime conspiracies in history. Many people do not understand how difficult it is to commit a conspiracy crime involving numerous co-conspirators. One clever and c unning individual has a good chance of getting away with a well-planned interp ersonal crime. Bring one partne r into the crime and the odds of getting away with it drop cons iderably. The more people involve d in the crime, the harder it is to get away with it. Why? Human nature is the answer. People get angry and jealous. They come to resent the fact that another conspi rator is getting \"more\" than they. They get in trouble and want to make a deal for themselves by informing on others. If a group of individuals degenera te to the point of engaging in human sacrifice, murder, and cannibalism, that would most likely be the be ginning of the end for such a group. The odds are that someone in the group would have a prob lem with such acts and be unable to maintain the secret. The appeal of the satanic conspiracy theory is twofold. First, it is a simple explanation for a complex problem. Nothing is more simple than \"the devil made them do it.\" If we do not understand something, we make it the work of some supernatural force. During the Middle Ages, serial killers were thought to be vampires and werewolves, and child sexual abuse was the work of demons taking the form of parent s and clergy. Even today, especially for those raised to religiously believe so, satanism offe rs an explanation as to why \"good\" people do bad things. It may also help to \"explain\" unus ual, bizarre, and compul sive sexual urges and behavior. Second, the conspiracy theory is a popular one. We find it difficult to believe that one bizarre individual could commit a crime we find so o ffensive. Conspiracy theories about soldiers missing in action (MlAs), abductions by UFOs, El vis Presley sightings, and the assassination of prominent public figures are the focus of much attention in this country. These conspiracy"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"theories and allegations of r itual abuse have the following in common: (1) self-proclaimed experts, (2) tabloid media intere st, (3) belief the government is involved in a coverup, and (4) emotionally involved direct and indirect victim/witnesses. On a recent television program commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of Jack the Ripper, almost fifty percent of the view ing audience who called the polling telephone numbers indicated that they thought the murder s were committed as part of a conspiracy involving the British Royal Family. The five experts on the program, however, unanimously agreed the crimes were the work of one disorg anized but lucky indivi dual who was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. In many ways, the murders of Jack the Ripper are similar to those allegedly committed by satanists today. If your child's molestation was perpetrated by a sophisticated sa tanic cult, there is nothing you could have done to prevent it and therefore no reason to feel any guilt. I have been present when parents who believe their children were r itually abused at day care centers have told others that the cults had sensor s in the road, lookout s in the air, and informers everywhere; therefore, the usually recomm ended advice of unannounced visi ts to the day care center would be impossible. Alternative Explanations Even if only part of an allegation is not true, what then is the answer to the question \"Why are victims alleging things that do not seem to be true?\" After cons ulting with psychiatrists, psychologists, anthropologists, th erapists, social workers, chil d sexual abuse experts, and law enforcement investigators for more than eight ye ars, I can find no single, simple answer. The answer to the question seems to be a complex set of dynamics that can be different in each case. In spite of the fact that some skeptics keep looking for it, th ere does not appear to be one answer to the question that fits every case. E ach case is different, and each case may involve a different combination of answers. I have identified a series of possible alternative answers to this ques tion. The alternative answers also do not preclude th e possibility that clever offe nders are sometimes involved. I will not attempt to explain completely these alternative answers beca use I cannot. They are presented simply as areas for consideration a nd evaluation by child sexual abuse intervenors, for further elaboration by experts in these fields, and for research by objective social scientists. The first step, however, in finding th e answers to this question is to admit the possibility that some of wh at the victims describe may not have happened. Some child advocates seem unwilling to do this. Pathological Distortion The first possible answer to why vic tims are alleging things that do not seem to be true is pathological distortion . The allegations may be errors in processing reality influenced by underlying mental disorders such as dissociative disorders, border line or histrionic personality disorders, or psychosis. These distortions may be manifested in false accounts of victimization in order to ga in psychological benefits su ch as attention and sympathy (factitious disorder). When such individuals re peatedly go from place to place or person to person making these false reports of their ow n \"victimization\", it is called Munchausen Syndrome. When the repealed false reports conc ern the \"victimization\" of their children or others linked to them, it is called Munchaus en Syndrome by Proxy. I am amazed when some"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"therapists state that they believe the allegatio ns because they cannot think of a reason why the \"victim\", whose failures are now explained and excused or who is now the center of attention at a conference or on a national television program, would lie. If you can be forgiven for mutilating and killing babies, you can be forgiven for anything. Many \"victims\" may develop pseudomemories of their victimization and eventually come to believe the events actually occurred. Noted fo rensic psychiatrist Park E. Dietz (personal communication, Nov. 1991) states: Pseudomemories have been acquired through dreams (particularly if one is encouraged to keep a journal or dream diary and to regard dr eam content as 'clues' about the past or as snippets of history), substance-induced alte red states of consciousness (alcohol or other drugs), group influence (particu larly hearing vivid accounts of ev ents occurring to others with whom one identifies emotionally such as occurs in incest su rvivor groups), reading vivid accounts of events occurring to others with w hom one identifies emotionally, watching such accounts in films or on television, and hypnosis . The most efficient means of inducing pseudomemories is hypnosis. It is characteristic of pseudome mories that the recollections of complex events (as opposed to a simple unit of information, such as a tag num ber) are incomplete and without chronological sequence. Often the person reports some un certainty because the pseudomemories are experienced in a manner they describe as 'hazy', 'fuzzy', or 'vague'. They are often perplexed that they recall some details vividly but others dimly. Pseudomemories are not delusions. When first telling others of pseudomemories, these individuals do not have the unsha kable but irrational conviction that deluded subjects have, but with social support they often come to defend vigorously the truthfulness of the pseudomemories. Pseudomemories are not fantasies, but may inco rporate elements from fantasies experienced in the past. Even where the events described are implausible, listeners may believe them because they are reported with such intense affect (i.e. with so much emotion attached to the story) that the listener concludes that the ev ents must have happened because no one could 'fake' the emotional aspects of the retelling. It also occurs, however, that persons report pseudomemories in such a matter-of-fact and emotionless manner that mental health professionals conclude that the person has 'di ssociated' intellectual knowledge of the events from emotional apprecia tion of their impact. Traumatic Memory The second possible answer is traumatic memory . Fear and severe trauma can cause victims to distort reality and confuse events. This is a well-documented fact in cases involving individuals taken hostage or in life-and-death situations. The di stortions may be part of an elaborate defense mechanism of the mind called \"splitting\" -- The victims create a clear-cut good-and-evil manifestation of their complex vic timization that is then psychologically more manageable. Through the defense mechanism of dissociation, the victim may escape the horrors of reality by inaccurately processing that reality. In a dissociative state a young child who ordinarily would know the difference might misinter pret a film or video as reality."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Another defense mechanism may tell the victim th at it could have been worse, and so his or her victimization was not so ba d. They are not alone in their victimization -- other children were also abused. Their father who abused th em is no different from other prominent people in the community they claim also abused th em. Satanism may help to explain why their outwardly good and religious parents did such terri ble things to them in the privacy of their home. Their religious tr aining may convince them that such unspeakable acts by supposedly \"good\" people must be the work of the devil. The described human sacrifice may be symbolic of the \"death\" of their childhood. It may be that we should anticipate that indivi duals severely abused as very young children by multiple offenders with fear as the primary controlling tactic will distort and embellish their victimization. Perhaps a horror-filled yet inaccura te account of victimization is not only not a counterindication of abuse, but is in fact a corroborative indicator of extreme physical, psychological, and/or sexual abus e. I do not believe it is a co incidence nor the result of deliberate planning by satanists that in almost all the cases of ritual abuse that have come to my attention, the abuse is alleged to have be gun prior to the age of seven and perpetrated by multiple offenders. It may well be that such abuse, at young age by multiple offenders, is the most difficult to accurately recall with the speci fic and precise detail needed by the criminal justice system, and the most likely to be distor ted and exaggerated when it is recalled. In her book Too Scared to Cry (1990), child psychiatrist Lenore Terr, a leading expert on psychic trauma in childhood, states \"that a series of early childhood shocks might not be fully and accurately 'reconstructed' from the dreams and behaviors of the adult\" (p. 5). Normal Childhood Fears and Fantasy The third possible answer may be normal childhood fears and fantasy . Most young children are afraid of ghosts and monsters. Even as adults, many people feel uncomfortable, for example, about dangling their arms over the si de of their bed. They still remember the \"monster\" under the bed from childhood. While young children may rarely invent stories about sexual activity, they might describe their victimizati on in terms of evil as they understand it. In church or at home, children may be told of satanic activ ity as the source of evil. The children may be \"dumping\" all th eir fears and worries unto an attentive and encouraging listener. Children do fantasize. Perhaps whatever causes a child to allege something impossible (such as being cut up and put back toge ther) is similar to what causes a child to allege something possible but improbable (such as witnessing another child being chopped up and eaten). Misperception, Confusion, and Trickery Misperception, confusion, and trickery may be a fourth answer. Expecting young children to give accurate accounts of sexual activity for whic h they have little frame of reference is unreasonable. The Broadway play Madame Butterfly is the true story of a man who had a 15- year affair, including the \"birth\" of a baby, with a \"woman\" who turns out to have been a man all along. If a grown man does not know when he has had vaginal intercourse with a woman, how can we expect young children not to be c onfused? Furthermore some clever offenders may deliberately introduce elements of satanism and the occult into the sexual exploitation simply to confuse or intimidate the victims. Simple magic and other techniques may be used to trick the children. Drugs may also be deliber ately used to confuse the victims and distort their perceptions. Such acts would then be M.O., not ritual. As previously stated, the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"perceptions of young victims may also be influe nced by any trauma being experienced. This is the most popular alternative explanation, a nd even the more zealous believers of ritual abuse allegations use it, but only to explain obviously im possible events. Overzealous Intervenors Overzealous intervenors , causing intervenor contagion, may be a fifth answer. These intervenors can include parents, family members, foster parents, doctors, therapists, social workers, law enforcement officers, prosecutors , and any combination thereof. Victims have been subtly as well as overtly rewarded and bribed by usually well-meaning intervenors for furnishing further details. In addition, some of what appears not to have happened may have originated as a result of inte rvenors making assumptions about or misinterpreting what the victims are saying. The intervenors then repe at, and possibly embellish, these assumptions and misinterpretations, and eventually the vic tims are \"forced\" to agree with or come to accept this \"official\" vers ion of what happened. The judgment of intervenors may be affected by their zeal to uncove r child sexual abuse, satanic activity, or conspiraci es. However \"well-intentioned\" , these overzealous intervenors must accept varying degrees of responsibility for the unsuccessful prosecution of those cases where criminal abuse did occur. This is th e most controversial and least popular of the alternative explanations. Urban Legends Allegations of and knowledge abou t ritualistic or satanic abus e may also be spread through urban legends . In The Vanishing Hitchhiker (1981), the first of hi s four books on the topic, Dr. Jan Harold Brunvand defines urban legends as \"realistic stories concerning recent events (or alleged events) with an ironic or supernatural twis t\" (p. xi). Dr. Brunvand's books convincingly explain that just because indivi duals throughout the country who never met each other tell the same story does not mean that it is true. Absurd ur ban legends about the corporate logos of Proctor and Gamble and Li z Claiborne being satanic symbols persist in spite of all efforts to refute them with real ity. Some urban legends about child kidnappings and other threats to citizens have even b een disseminated unknowingly by law enforcement agencies. Such legends have always existed, but today the mass media aggressively participate in their rapid and more effici ent dissemination. Many Americans mistakenly believe that tabloid television s hows check out and verify the de tails of their stories before pulling them on the air. Mass hysteria may par tially account for large numbers of victims describing the same symp toms or experiences. Training conferences for all the disciplines involv ed in child sexual abuse may also play a role in the spread of this contag ion. At one child abuse conferen ce I attended, an exhibitor was selling more than 50 different books dealing with satanism and the occu lt. By the end of the conference, he had sold nearly all of them. At another national child sexual abuse conference, I witnessed more than 100 a ttendees copying down the wide ly disseminated 29 \"Symptoms Characterizing Satanic Ritual Abuse\" in presc hool-aged children. Is a four-year-old child's \"preoccupation with urine and feces\" an indication of satanic ritual abuse or part of normal development? Combination"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Most multidimensional child sex ring cases probably involve a combination of the answers previously set forth, as well as other possibl e explanations unknown to me at this time. Obviously, cases with adult survivors are more likely to involve some of these answers than those with young children. Each case of sexual victimization mu st be individually evaluated on its own merits without any preconceived ex planations. All the possibilities must be explored if for no other reas on than the fact that the defense attorneys for any accused subjects will almost certainly do so. Most people would agree that just because a vi ctim tells you one detail th at turns out to be true, this does not mean that every detail is true. But many people seem to believe that if you can disprove one part of a victim 's story, then the entire story is false. As previously stated, one of my main concerns in th ese cases is that people are ge tting away with sexually abusing children or committing other crimes because we cannot prove that they are members of organized cults that murder and eat people. I have discovered that the subject of multidimensional child sex rings is a very emotional and polarizing issue. Everyone seems to demand that one choose a side. On one side of the issue are those who say that noth ing really happened and it is all a big witch hunt led by overzealous fanatics and incompetent \"experts. \" The other side says, in essence, that everything happened; victims never lie about chil d sexual abuse, and so it must be true. There is a middle ground. It is th e job of the professional inves tigator to listen to all the victims and conduct appropriate investigation in an effort to find out what happened, considering all possibilities. Not all childhood trauma is abuse. Not all child abuse is a crime. The great frustration of these cases is the fact that you are often convi nced that something traumatic happened to the victim, but do not know with any degree of certainty exactly what happened, when it happened, or who did it. Do Victims Lie about Sexu al Abuse and Exploitation? The crucial central issue in the evaluation of a response to cases of mu ltidimensional child sex rings is the statement \"Children never lie about sexual abuse or explo itation. If they have details, it must have happened.\" This statem ent, oversimplified by many, is the basic premise upon which some believe the child sexual abuse a nd exploitation movement is based. It is almost never questioned or de bated at training conferences. In fact, during the 1970s, there was a successful crusade to eliminate laws requi ring corroboration of child victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. The best way to convict child molesters is to have the child victims testify in court. If we believe them, the jury will believe them. Any challenge to this basic premise was viewed as a threat to the m ovement and a denial that the problem existed. I believe that children rarely lie about sexual abuse or exploi tation, if a lie is defined as a statement deliberately and maliciously intended to deceive. The problem is the oversimplification of the statement. Just becau se a child is not lying does not necessarily mean the child is telling the truth. I believe that in the majority of these cases, the victims are not lying. They are telling you what they have come to believe has happened to them. Furthermore the assumption that children rarely lie about sexual abuse does not necessarily apply to everything a child says during a se xual abuse investigation. Stories of mutilation, murder, and cannibalism are not re ally about sexual abuse."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Children rarely lie about sexual abuse or expl oitation. but they do fantasize, furnish false information, furnish misleading information, misp erceive events, try to please adults, respond to leading questions, and respond to rewards. Ch ildren are not adults in little bodies and do go through developmental stages that must be evaluated and und erstood. In many ways, however, children are no better and no worse than other victims or witnesses of a crime. They should not be automatically believed, nor s hould they be automatically disbelieved. The second part of the statement -- if child ren can supply details, the crime must have happened -- must also be carefu lly evaluated. The details in ques tion in most of the cases of multidimensional child sex rings have little to do with sexual activity. Law enforcement and social workers must do more than attempt to determine how a child could have known about the sex acts. These cases involve determining how a victim could have known about a wide variety of bizarre and ritualistic activity. Y oung children may know little about specific sex acts, but they may know a lo t about monsters, torture, kidnapping, and murder. Victims may supply details of sexual and other ac ts using information from sources other than their own direct victimization. Such sources must be evaluated carefully by the investigator of multidimensional child sex rings. Personal Knowledge : The victim may have personal knowle dge of the sexual or ritual acts, but not as a result of the a lleged victimization. The knowledge could have come from viewing pornography, sex education, or o ccult material; witnessing sexual or ritual ac tivity in the home; or witnessing the sexual a buse of others. It could also have come from having been sexually or physically abused, but by other than the alleged offe nders and in ways other than the alleged offense. Other Children or Victims : Young children today are socially interacting more often and at a younger age than ever before. Many parent s are unable to provide possibly simple explanations for their children's stories because they were not with the children when the events occurred. They do not even know what videotapes their children may have seen, what games they may have played, or what stories th ey may have been told or overheard. Children are being placed in day care cent ers for eight, ten, or twelve hours a day starting as young as six weeks of age. The children share experiences by playing hous e, school, or doctor. Bodily functions such as urination and defecation ar e a focus of attention for these young children. To a certain extent, each child shares th e experiences of all the other children. The odds are fairly high that in any typical da y care center there might be some children who are victims of incest; victims of physical abuse; victims of psychological abuse; children of cult members (even satanists) ; children of sexually open pa rents; children of sexually indiscriminate parents; children of parents obs essed with victimization; children of parents obsessed with the evils of satanism; children without conscience; children with a teenage brother or pregnant mother; ch ildren with heavy metal music and literature in the home; children with bizarre toys, games, comics, a nd magazines; children with a VCR and slasher films in their home; children with access to dial-a-porn, party lines, or pornography; or children victimized by a day care center staff me mber. The possible effects of the interaction of such children prior to th e disclosure of the alleged abuse must be evaluated, Adult survivors may obtain details from group thera py sessions, support networ ks, church groups, or self-help groups. The willingness and ability of siblings to co rroborate adult su rvivor accounts of ritual abuse varies. Some will support and partially corroborate the victim's allegations. Others will vehemently deny them and suppor t their accused parents or relatives."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Media : The amount of sexually explicit, occult, an ti-occult, or violence-oriented material available to adults and even children in the modern world is overwhelming. This includes movies, videotapes, television, music, toys, and books. There are also documentaries on satanism, witchcraft, and the occult that are ava ilable on videotape. Most of the televangelists have videotapes on the topics that they are selling on their programs. The National Coalition on Television Violence Ne ws (1988) estimates that 12% of the movies produced in the United States can be classified as satanic horror films. Cable television and the home VCR make all this material readily available even to young children. Religious broadcasters and almost all th e television tabloid and magazi ne programs have done shows on satanism and the occult. Heavy metal and black metal music, which often has a satanic theme, is readily available and popular. In addition to the much-debated fantasy role-playing games, there are numerous popular toys on the market with an occult- oriented, bizarre, or violent theme. Books on satanism and the occult, both ficti on and nonfiction, are readily available in most bookstores, especially Christian bookstores. Several recent books specifically discuss the issue of ritual abuse of children. Obviously, ve ry young children do not read this material, but their parents, relatives, and therap ists might and then discuss it in front of or with them. Much of the material intended to fight the problem actually fuels the problem and damages effective prosecution. Suggestions and Leading Questions : This problem is particularly important in cases stemming from custody/visitation disputes involvi ng at least one child un der the age of seven. It is my opinion that most suggestive, lead ing questioning of children by intervenors is inadvertently done as part of a good-faith effort to learn the truth. Not all intervenors are in equal positions to potentially infl uence victim allegations. Parent s and relatives especially are in a position to subtly influence their young ch ildren to describe their victimization in a certain way. Children may also overhear their parents discussing the details of the case. Children often tell their parents what they beli eve their parents want or need to hear. Some children may be instinctively attempting to provi de \"therapy\" for their parents by telling them what seems to satisfy them and somehow makes them feel better. In one case a father gave the police a tape recording to \"prove\" that his child's statements were spontaneous disclosures and not the result of leading, suggestive questions. The tape recording indi cated just the opposite. Why then did the father voluntarily give it to the police? Probably because he truly believed that he was not influencing his ch ild's statements -- but he was. Therapists are probably in the best position to in fluence the allegations of adult survivors. The accuracy and reliability of th e accounts of adult survivors who have been hypnotized during therapy is certainly open to question. One nati onally-known therapist pers onally told me that the reason police cannot find out abou t satanic or ritualistic activity from child victims is that they do not know how to ask leading ques tions. Highly suggestiv e books and pictures portraying \"satanic\" activity have been devel oped and marketed to therapists for use during evaluation and treatment. Types and styles of ve rbal interaction useful in therapy may create significant problems in a criminal investigati on. It should be noted, however, that when a therapist does a poor inve stigative interview as pa rt of a criminal investigation, that is the fault of the criminal justice system that al lowed it and not the th erapist who did it. The extremely sensitive, emotional, and religi ous nature of these cases makes problems with leading questions more likely than in other ki nds of cases. Intervenors motivated by religious"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"fervor and/or exaggerated con cerns about sexual abuse of chil dren are more likely to lose their objectivity. Misperception and Confusion : In one case, a child's descript ion of the apparently impossible act of walking through a wall turned out to be the very possible act of walking between the studs of an unfinished wall in a room under cons truction. In another case , pennies in the anus turned out to be copper-foil-covered supposito ries. The children may describe what they believe happened. It is not a lie, but neither is it an accurate account of what happened. Education and Awareness Programs : Some well-intentioned awareness programs designed to prevent child set abuse, aler t professionals, or fight satanism may in fact be unrealistically increasing the fears of professionals, child ren, and parents and creating self-fulfilling prophesies. Some of what children and their parents are telling intervenors may have been learned in or fueled by such programs. Re ligious programs, books, and pamphlets that emphasize the power and evil force of Satan may be adding to the problem. In fact most of the day care centers in which ritualistic abuse is al leged to hate taken place are church-affiliated centers, and many of the adult survivors alleging it come from apparently religious families. Law Enforcement Perspective The perspective with which one looks at satani c, occult, or ritualistic crime is extremely important. As stated, sociologists, therapists, relig ious leaders, parents, and just plain citizens each have their own valid concerns and views about this issue. This discussion, however, deals primarily with the law enforcemen t or criminal justice perspective. When you combine an emotional issue such as th e sexual abuse of children with an even more emotional issue such as people's religious beli efs, it is difficult to maintain objectivity and remember the law enforcement perspective. Some police officers may even feel that all crime is caused by evil, all evil is caused by Satan, an d therefore, all crime is satanic crime. This may be a valid religious perspec tive, but it is of no relevance to the investigation of crime for purposes of prosecution. Many of the police officers who lecture on sata nic or occult crime do not even investigate such cases. Their presentations are more a refl ection of their personal religious beliefs than documented investigative information. They ar e absolutely entitled to their beliefs, but introducing themselves as current or former police officers and then speaking as religious advocates causes confusion. As difficult as it might be, police officers must separate the religious and law enforcement perspectives when they are lecturing or investigating in their official capacities as law enforcement officer s. Many law enforcement officers begin their presentations by stating that th ey are not addressing or judging anyone's religious beliefs, and then proceed to do exactly that. Some police officers have resigned rather than curtail or limit their involvement in this issue as ordered by their departments. Perhaps such officers deserve credit fo r recognizing that they could no longer keep the perspectives separate. Law enforcement officers and all professionals in this field should avoi d the \"paranoia\" that has crept into this issue and into some of the training conferences. Paranoid type belief systems are characterized by the gradual develo pment of intricate, complex, and elaborate systems of thinking based on and often proceedi ng logically from misinterpretation of actual"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"events. Paranoia typically involves hypervigilanc e over the perceived thr eat, the belief that danger is around every corner, a nd the willingness to take up the challenge and do something about it. Another very important aspect of this paranoia is the belief that those who do not recognize the threat are evil and corrupt. In this extreme view, you are either with them or against them. You are either part of the solution or part of the problem. Overzealousness and exaggeration motivated by the true religious fervor of those involved is more acceptable than that motivated by ego or profit. There are those who are deliberately distorting and hyping this issue for personal noto riety and profit. Satanic and occult crime and ritual abuse of children has b ecome a growth industry. Speak ing fees, books, video and audio tapes, prevention material, television and radi o appearances all bring egoistic and financial rewards. Bizarre crime and evil can occur without or ganized satanic activity. The professional perspective requires that we di stinguish between what we know and what we're not sure of. The facts are: 1. Some individuals believe in and are involve d in something commonly called satanism and the occult. 2. Some of these individuals commit crime. 3. Some groups of individuals share these belief s and involvement in this satanism and the occult. 4. Some members of these gr oups commit crime together. The unanswered questions are: 1. What is the connection between the belief system and the crimes committed? 2. Is there an organized conspiracy of satanic and occult believers responsible for interrelated serious crime (e.g., molestation, murder)? After all the hype and hysteria are put aside, the reali zation sets in that most satanic/occult activity involves the commission of no crimes, and that which does usually involves the commission of relatively minor crimes such as trespassing, vandalism, cruelty to animals, or petty thievery. The law enforcement problems most often linke d to satanic or occult activity are: a. Vandalism b. Desecration of churches and cemeteries c. Thefts from churches and cemeteries d. Teenage gangs"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"e. Animal mutilations f. Teenage suicide g. Child abuse h. Kidnapping i. Murder and human sacrifice Valid evidence shows some \"connection\" betwee n satanism and the occult and the first six problems (#a-f) set forth above. The \"connection\" to the last three problems (#g-i) is far more uncertain. Even where there seems to be a \"connection\", the nature of the connection needs to be explored. It is easy to blame i nvolvement in satanism and the occult for behaviors that have complex motivations. A teenager's excessive involvement in satanism and the occult is usually a symptom of a problem and not the cause of a problem. Blaming satanism for a teenager's vandalism, theft, suicid e, or even act of mu rder is like blaming a criminal's offenses on his tattoos: Both are often signs of the same rebelliousness and lack of self-esteem that contribute to the commission of crimes. The rock band Judas Priest was recently sued for allegedly inciting two teenagers to suicide through subliminal messages in their recordings . In 1991 Anthony Pratkanis of the University of California at Santa Cruz, who served as an ex pert witness for the defense, stated the boys in question \"lived troubled lives, lives of drug and alcohol abuse, run-ins with the law ... family violence, and chronic unemployme nt. What issues did the trial and the subsequent mass media coverage emphasize? Certainl y not the need for drug treatment centers; there was no evaluation of the pros and cons of America's j uvenile justice system, no investigation of the schools, no inquiry into how to prevent family violence, no discussion of the effects of unemployment on a family. Instead our attention was mesmerized by an attempt to count the number of subliminal demons that can dan ce on the end of a record needle\" (p. 1). The law enforcement investigator must objectiv ely evaluate the lega l significance of any criminal's spiritual beliefs. In most cases, incl uding those involving sata nists, it will have little or no legal significance. If a crime is committed as part of a spiritual belief system, it should make no difference which belief system it is. The crime is the same whether a child is abused or murdered as part of a Christian, Hare Kr ishna, Moslem, or any other belief system. We generally don't label crimes w ith the name of the perpetrato r's religion. Why then are the crimes of child molesters, rapists, sadists, and murderers who happen to be involved in satanism and the occult labeled as satanic or occult crimes? If criminals use a spiritual belief system to rationalize and justify or to facilitate and enhance their criminal activity, should the focus of law enforcement be on the belief system or on the criminal activity? Several documented murders have been committed by individuals involved in one way or another in satanism or the occult. In some of these murders the perpetrator has even introduced elements of the occult (e.g. satanic symbols at crime scene). Does that automatically make these satanic murders? It is my opinion that the answer is no. Ritualistic murders committed by serial killers or sexual sa dists are not necessarily satanic or occult murders. Ritualistic murders committed by psychotic killers who hear the voice of Satan are"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"no more satanic murders than murders committed by psychotic killers who hear the voice of Jesus are Christian murders. Rather a satanic murder should be defined as one committed by two or more individuals who rationally plan the crime and whose PRIMARY motivation is to fulfill a prescribed satanic ritual calling for the murder. By this defin ition I have been unable to identify even one documented satanic murder in the United Stat es. Although such murders may have and can occur, they appear to be few in number. In addition the commission of such killings would probably be the beginning of the end for such a group. It is highly un likely that they could continue to kill several people, every year , year after year, and not be discovered. A brief typology of satanic and occult practitioners is helpful in evaluating what relationship, if any, such practices have to crimes under investigation. The following typology is adapted from the investigative experience of Officer Sandi Gallant of the San Francisco Police Department, who began to study the criminal asp ects of occult activity long before it became popular. No typology is perfect, but I use this typology becaus e it is simple and offers investigative insights. Most prac titioners fall into one of three categories, any of which can be practiced alone or in groups: 1. YOUTH SUBCULTURE -- Most teenagers involved in fantasy role-playing games, heavy metal music, or satanism and the occu lt are going through a stage of adolescent development and commit no significant crim es. The teenagers who have more serious problems are usually those from dysfunc tional families or those who have poor communication within their families. These troubled teenagers turn to satanism and the occult to overcome a sense of alienation, to rebel, to obtain power, or to justify their antisocial behavior. For these teenager s it is the symbolism, not the spirituality, that is more important. It is either the ps ychopathic or the oddball, loner teenager who is most likely to get into serious troubl e. Extreme involvement in the occult is a symptom of a problem, not the cause. This is not to deny, however, that satanism and the occult can be negative influences for a troubled teenager. But to hysterically warn teenagers to avoid this \"mysterious, power ful and dangerous\" thing called satanism will drive more teenagers right to it. Some rebellious teenagers will do whatever will most shock and outrage society in order to flaunt their rejection of adult norms. 2. DABBLERS (SELF-STYLED) -- \"For these practitioners th ere is little or no spiritual motivation. They may mix satanism, witchc raft, paganism, and any aspects of the occult to suit their purposes. Symbols mean whatever they want them or believe them to mean. Molesters, rapists, drug dealers, and murderers may dabble in the occult and may even commit their crimes in a ceremonial or ritualistic way. This category has the potential to be the most dange rous, and most of the \"satan ic\" killers fall into this category. Their involvement in satanism a nd the occult is a symptom of a problem, and a rationalization and justification of an tisocial behavior. Satanic/occult practices (as well as those of other spir itual belief systems) can also be used as a mechanism to facilitate criminal objectives. 3. TRADITIONAL (ORTHODOX) -- These are the so-called true believers. They are often wary of outsiders. Because of this and constitutional issues, such groups are difficult for law enforcement to penetrate. Although there may be much we don't know about these groups, as of now there is little or no hard evidence that as a group they are involved in serious, organized criminal activity. In addition, in stead of being self- perpetuating master crime conspirators, \"t rue believers\" probably have a similar problem with their teenagers rebelling agains t their belief system. To some extent even"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"these Traditional satanists are self-stylize d. They practice what they have come to believe is \"satanism.\" There is little or no evidence of the much-discussed multigenerational satanists whose beliefs and practices have supposedly been passed down through the centuries. Many admitted adu lt satanists were in fact raised in conservative Christian homes. Washington Post editor Walt Harrington reported in a 1986 story on Anton LaVey and his Church of Satan that \"sociologists who have studied LaVey's church say that its members often had serious childhood probl ems like alcoholic parents or broken homes, or that they were traumatized by guilt-ridden fundamenta list upbringings, turning to Satanism as a dramatic way to purge their debi litating guilt\" (p. 14). Some have claimed that the accounts of ritual abuse victims coincide with historical records of what traditional or multigenerational satanists are known to have practiced dow n through the ages. Jeffrey Burton Russell, Professor of History at the Un iversity of California at Sant a Barbara and the author of numerous scholarly books on the devil and satani sm, believes that the un iversal consensus of modern historians on satanism is (personal communication, Nov. 1991): (1) incidents of orgy, infanticide, cannibalism, and other such conduct have occurred from the ancient world down to the present; (2) such in cidents were isolated and limited to local antisocial groups; (3) during the period of Christian dominance in European culture, such groups were associated with the Devil in the mi nds of the authorities; (4) in some cases the sectaries believed that they were worshiping Sa tan; (5) no organized cult of Satanists existed in the Christian period beyond localities, and on no account was there ever any widespread Satanist organization or conspi racy; (6) no reliable historical sources indicate that such organizations existed; (7) the black mass app ears only once in the sources before the late nineteenth century. Many police officers ask what to look for during the search of the scene of suspected satanic activity. The answer is simple: Look for evid ence of a crime. A pentagram is no more criminally significant than a crucifix unless it co rroborates a crime or a criminal conspiracy. If a victim's description of the lo cation or the instrume nts of the crime includes a pentagram, then the pentagram would be evidence. But the sa me would be true if the description included a crucifix. In many cases of alleged satanic ritu al abuse, investigati on can find evidence that the claimed offenders are members only of main stream churches and are often described as very religious. There is no way any one law enforcement offi cer can become knowledgeable about all the symbols and rituals of every sp iritual belief system that might become part of a criminal investigation. The officer needs only to be tr ained to recognize the possible investigative significance of such signs, symbols, and rituals. Knowledgeable religious scholars, academics, and other true experts in the community can be consulted if a more detailed analysis is necessary. Any analysis, however, may have only limited application, especially to cases involving teenagers, dabblers, and other se lf-styled practitioners. The fact is signs, symbols, and rituals can mean anything that practitioners want th em to mean and/or anything that observers interpret them to mean. The meaning of symbols can also change over time, place, and circumstance. Is a swastika spray-painted on a wall an ancient symbol of pr osperity and good fortune, a recent symbol of"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Nazism and anti-Semitism, or a current symbol of hate, paranoia, and adolescent defiance? The peace sign which in the 1960s was a familiar antiwar symbol is now supposed to be a satanic symbol. Some symbols and holidays beco me \"satanic\" only because the antisatanists say they are. Then those who want to be \"s atanists\" adopt them, a nd now you have \"proof\" they are satanic. In spite of what is sometimes said or suggest ed at law enforcement training conferences, police have no authority to sei ze any satanic or occult paraphern alia they might see during a search. A legally-valid reason must exist for doing so. It is not the job of law enforcement to prevent satanists from engaging in noncrimina l teaching, rituals, or other activities. Investigating Multidimen sional Child Sex Rings Multidimensional child sex rings can be among th e most difficult, frustrating, and complex cases that any law enforcement officer will ever investigate. The investigation of allegations of recent activity from multiple young children under the age of seven presents one set of problems and must begin quick ly, with interviews of all potential victims being completed as soon as possible. The investigation of allegatio ns of activity ten or more years earlier from adult survivors presents other problems and should proceed, unl ess victims are at immediate risk, more deliberately, with gr adually-increasing resources as corroborated facts warrant. In spite of any skepticism, allegations of r itual abuse should be a ggressively and thoroughly investigated, This investigation should attempt to corroborate the allegatio ns of ritual abuse. but should simultaneously also attempt to identify alternative explanations. The only debate is over how much investigation is enough. Any law enforcement agency must be prepared to defend and justify its actions when scrutinized by the public, the media, elected officials, or the courts. This does not mean, however, that a law enforcement agency has an obligation to prove that the alleged crimes did not occur. This is almost always impossible to do and investigators should be alert for and avoid this trap. One major problem in the investigation of multidimensional child sex rings is the dilemma of recognizing soon enough that you have one. Investig ators must be alert for cases with the potential for the four basic dynamics: (a) mu ltiple young victims, (b) multiple offenders, (c) fear as the controlling tactic, and (d) bizarre or ritualis tic activity. The following techniques apply primarily to the investigation of such multidimensional child sex rings: Minimize Satanic/occult Aspect -- There are those who claim that one of the major reasons more of these cases have not been successfully prosecuted is that the satanic/occult aspect has not been aggressively pursued. One state ha s even introduced legislation creating added penalties when certain crimes are committed as pa rt of a ritual or ceremony. A few states have passed special ritual crime laws. I strongly di sagree with such an approach. It makes no difference what spiritual belief system was used to enhance a nd facilitate or rationalize and justify criminal behavior. It serves no purpose to \"prove\" someone is a sa tanist. As a matter of fact, if it is alleged that the subject committed certain criminal acts under the influence of or in order to conjure up supernatur al spirits or forces, this may very well be the basis for an insanity or diminished capacity defense, or may damage the intent aspect of a sexually motivated crime. The defense may very well be mo re interested in all the \"evidence of satanic activity.\" Some of the satanic crime \"experts\" who train law enforcement wind up working or testifying for the defense in these cases."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"It is best to focus on the crime and all the ev idence to corroborate its commission. Information about local satanic or occult activity is only of value if it is based on specific law enforcement intelligence and not on some vague, unsubstantiated generalities from religious groups. Cases are not solved by decoding signs, symbols, and dates using undocumented satanic crime \"manuals.\" In one case a law enforcement agen cy executing a search warrant seized only the satanic paraphernalia and left behind the othe r evidence that would ha ve corroborated victim statements. Cases are solved by people- and be havior-oriented investigation. Evidence of satanic or occult activity may help explain certai n aspects of the case, but even offenders who commit crimes in a spiritual context are usua lly motivated by power, sex, and money. Keep Investigation and Religious Beliefs Separate -- I believe that one of the biggest mistakes any investigator of these cases can ma ke is to attribute supe rnatural powers to the offenders. During an investigation a good inves tigator may sometimes be able to use the beliefs and superstitions of the offenders to hi s or her advantage. The reverse happens if the investigator believes that the offenders possess supernatural powers. Satanic/occult practitioners have no more power than any other human beings. Law enforcement officers who believe that the investigati on of these cases puts them in conflict with th e supernatural forces of evil should probably not be assigned to them. The religious be liefs of officers should provide spiritual strength and support for them but should not affect the objectivity and professionalism of the investigation. It is easy to get caught up in these case s and begin to see \"satanism\" everywhere. Oversensitization to this percei ved threat may cause an investig ator to \"see\" satanism in a crime when it really is not there (quasi-satanis m). Often the eye sees what the mind perceives. It may also cause an investigator not to rec ognize a staged crime scene deliberately seeded with \"satanic clues\" in order to mislead the police (pseudo-satanism). On rare occasions an overzealous investigator or intervenor may even be tempted to plant \"evidence of satanism\" in order to corroborate such allegatio ns and beliefs. Supervisors need to be alert for and monitor these reactions in their investigators. Listen to the Victims -- It is not the investigator's duty to believe the victims; it is his or her job to listen and be an objective fact finde r. Interviews of young ch ildren should be done by investigators trained and experien ced in such interviews. Investig ators must have direct access to the alleged victims for interview purposes. Therapists for an adult survivor sometimes want to act as intermediaries in thei r patient's interview. This should be avoided if at all possible. Adult survivor interviews are often confus ing difficult and extremely time-consuming. The investigator must remember however that almo st anything is possible. Most important the investigator must remember that there is much middle ground. Just because one event did happen does not mean that all reported events happened, and just because one event did not happen does not mean that all other events did not happen. Do not become such a zealot that you believe it all nor such a c ynic that you believe nothing. Vary ing amounts and parts of the allegation may be factual. Attempting to fi nd evidence of what did happen is the great challenge of these cases. All investigative interaction with victims must be carefully and thoroughly documented. Assess and Evaluate Victim Statements -- This is the part of the investigative process in child sexual victimization cases that seems to have been lost . Is the victim describing events and activities that are consistent with law enfo rcement documented criminal behavior, or that are consistent with distorted media accounts a nd erroneous public per ceptions of criminal behavior? Investigators should apply the \"template of probabi lity.\" Accounts of child sexual"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"victimization that are more like books, televisi on, and movies (e.g. big conspiracies, child sex slaves, organized pornography ring s) and less like documented cases should be viewed with skepticism but thoroughly invest igated. Consider and investigate all possibl e explanations of events. It is the investigator's job, and th e information learned will be invaluable in counteracting the defense atto rneys when they raise the alternative explanations. For example, an adult survivor's account of ritu al victimization might be explained by any one of at least four possibilities: First, the alle gations may be a fairly accurate account what actually happened. Second, they may be deliber ate lies (malingering), told for the usual reasons people lie (e.g. money, revenge, jeal ousy). Third, they may be deliberate lies (factitious disorder) told for at ypical reasons (e.g. attention, fo rgiveness). Lies so motivated are less likely to be recognized by the investigat or and more likely to be rigidly maintained by the liar unless and until confr onted with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Fourth, the allegations may be a highly inaccu rate account of what actually happened, but the victim truly believes it (pseudomemory) and therefore is not lying. A polygraph examination of such a victim would be of limited value. Other explanat ions or combinations of these explanations are also possible. Only thorough investigation will point to the correct or most likely explanation. Investigators cannot rely on therapists or sa tanic crime experts as a shortcut to the explanation. In one case, the \"experts\" confirmed and validated the account of a female who claimed to be a 15-year-old deaf-mute kidnapp ed and held for three years by a satanic cult and forced to participate in bizarre ritual s before recently escaping. Active investigation, however, determined she was a 27-year-old wo man who could hear and speak, who had not been kidnapped by anyone, and who had a length y history of mental problems and at least three other similar reports of false victimiza tion. Her \"accurate\" accounts of what the \"real satanists\" do were simply the result of having read, while in mental hospitals, the same books that the \"experts\" had. A therap ist may have important insights about whether an individual was traumatized, but knowing the exact cause of that trauma is another matter. There have been cases where investigation has discovered that individuals diagnosed by therapists as suffering from Post-Vietnam Syndrome were never in Vietnam or saw no combat. Conversely, in another case, a law enforcement \"e xpert\" on satanic crime to ld a therapist that a patient's accounts of satanic murders in a rura l Pacific Northwest town were probably true because the community was a hot bed of such satanic activity. When the therapist explained that there was almost no violent crime reported in the community, the officer explained that that is how you know it is the satanists. If you knew about the murders or found the bodies, it would not be satanists. How do you argue with that kind of logic? The first step in the assessment and evaluation of victim statements is to determine the disclosure sequence, including how much time ha s elapsed since disclosure was first made and the incident was reported to the police or social services. The l onger the delay, the bigger the potential for problems. The next step is to determine the number and purpose of all prior interviews of the victim concerning the allegations. The more interviews conducted before the investigative interv iew, the larger the potential for problems. Although there is nothing wrong with admitting s hortcomings and seeking help, law enforcement should never abdicate its control over the investigative inte rview. When an invest igative interview is conducted by or with a social worker or ther apist using a team approach, law enforcement must direct the process. Problems can also be created by interviews conducted by various intervenors AFTER the investigative interview(s)."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The investigator must closely and carefully eval uate events in the vic tim's life before, during, and after the alleged abuse. Events to be evaluated before the alleged abuse include: • Background of victim. • Abuse of drugs in home. • Pornography in home. • Play, television, and VCR habits. • Attitudes about sexuality in home. • Extent of sex education in home. • Activities of siblings. • Need or craving for attention. • Religious beliefs and training. • Childhood fears. • Custody/visitation disputes. • Victimization of or by family members. • Interaction between victims. Events to be evaluated during the alleged abuse include: • Use of fear or scare tactics. • Degree of trauma. • Use of magic deception or trickery. • Use of rituals. • Use of drugs. • Use of pornography. Events to be evaluated after the alleged abuse include: • Disclosure sequence. • Background of prior interviewers. • Background of parents. • Co-mingling of victims. • Type of therapy received. Evaluate Contagion . Consistent statements obtained from different multiple victims are powerful pieces of corroborative evidence -- that is as long as those statements were not \"contaminated.\" Investigation must carefully evaluate both pre- and post-disclosure contagion, and both victim and in tervenor contagion. Are the di fferent victim statements consistent because they describe common expe riences or events, or because they reflect contamination or urban legends? The sources of potential contag ion are widespread. Victims can communicate with each other both prior to and after their disclosures. In tervenors can communicate with each other and with victims. The team or cell concepts of investigation are attempts to deal with potential investigator contagion. All th e victims are not interviewed by the same individuals, and interviewers do not necessarily share informati on directly with each other. Teams report to a leader or supervisor who evaluates the informa tion and decides what other investigators need to know. Documenting existing contagion and eliminati ng additional contagion are crucial to the successful investigation and prosecution of thes e cases. There is no way, however, to erase or undo contagion. The best you can hope for is to id entify and evaluate it and attempt to explain it. Mental health professionals requested to evaluate suspected vict ims must be carefully"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"selected. Having a victim evalua ted by one of the self-proclai med experts on satanic ritual abuse or by some other overzealous intervenor ma y result in the credibility of that victim's testimony being severely damaged. In order to evaluate the contagion element, i nvestigators must meticulously and aggressively investigate these cases. The precise disclosure sequence of the victim must be carefully identified and documented. Investigators must verify through active investigation the exact nature and content of each di sclosure outcry or statement made by the victim. Second-hand information about disclosure is not good enough. Whenever possible, personal visits should be ma de to all locations of alleged abuse and the victim's homes. Events prior to the alleged a buse must be carefully evaluated. Investigators may have to view television programs, films, an d videotapes seen by th e victims. It may be necessary to conduct a background investig ation and evaluation of everyone, both professional and nonprofessional, who interviewed the victims about the allegations prior to and after the investigative interview(s). Investigators must be familiar with the information about ritual abuse of children being dissemi nated in magazines, books, television programs, videotapes, and conferences. Ev ery possible way that a victim could have learned about the details of the abuse must be explored if for no other reason than to eliminate them and counter the defense's arguments. There may, however, be validity to these contagion factors. They may explain some of the \"unbelievable\" aspect s of the case and result in the successful prosecution of the subs tance of the case. Consistency of statements becomes more significant if contagion is identified or disproved by independent investig ation. The easier cases are the ones where there is a single, identifiable source of contagion. Most cas es, however, seem to involve multiple contagion factors. Munchausen Syndrome and Munchausen Syndr ome by Proxy are complex and controversial issues in these cases. No attempt will be ma de to discuss them in detail, but they are documented facts (Rosenberg, 1987). Most of the literature about them focuses on their manifestation in the medical setting as false or self-inflicted illness or injury. They are also manifested in the criminal justice setting as false or self-inflicted crime victimization. If parents would poison their child ren to prove an illness, they might sexually abuse their children to prove a crime. \"Victims\" have been known to destroy property, manufacture evidence, and mutilate themselves in order to convince others of their victimization. The motivation is psychological gain (i.e. attention, forgiveness, etc.) and not necessarily money, jealousy, or revenge. These are the unpopular, but documente d, realities of the world. Recognizing their existe nce does not mean that child sexual abuse and sexual assault are not real and serious problems. Establish Communication with Parents . The importance and difficulty of this technique in extrafamilial cases involving young children cannot be overemphasized. An investigator must maintain ongoing communication with the parents of victims in these abuse cases. Not all parents react the same way to the alleged abus e of their children. So me are very supportive and cooperative. Others overreact and some even deny the victimization. Sometimes there is animosity and mistrust among parents with differ ent reactions. Once the pa rents lose faith in the police or prosecutor and be gin to interrogate their own children and conduct their own investigation, the case ma y be lost forever. Parents from one case communicate the results of their \"investigation\" with each other, and some have even contacted the parents in other cases. Such parental activity is an obvious source of potential contamination."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Parents must be made to understand that their ch ildren's credibility will be jeopardized when and if the information obtained tu rns out to be unsubstantiated or false. To minimize this problem, within the limits of the law and w ithout jeopardizing investigative techniques, parents must be told on a regular basis how th e case is progressing. Parents can also be assigned constructive things to do (e.g. lobbying for new legislation, working on awareness and prevention programs) in order to ch annel their energy, concern, and \"guilt.\" Develop a Contingency Plan . If a department waits until actually confronted with a case before a response is developed, it may be too late. In cases involving ongoing abuse of children, departments must respond quickly, and this requires advanced planning. There are added problems for small- to medium-si zed departments with limited personnel and resources. Effective investigation of these cas es requires planning, iden tification of resources, and, in many cases, mutual aid agreements between agencies. The U.S. Department of Defense has conducted specialized training and has developed such a plan for child sex ring cases involving military facilities and personnel. Once a case is contaminated and out of control, I have little advice on how to salvage what may once have been a prosecutable criminal viol ation. A few of these cases have even been lost on appeal after a conviction be cause of contamination problems. Multidisciplinary Task Forces . Sergeant Beth Dickinson, Lo s Angeles County Sheriff's Department, was the chairperson of the Multi-Victim, Multi-Suspect Child Sexual Abuse Subcommittee. Sergeant Dickinson states (personal communication, Nov. 1989): One of the biggest obstacles for investigat ors to overcome is th e reluctance of law enforcement administrators to commit sufficient resources early on to an investigation that has the potential to be a multidimensional child sex ring. It is important to get in and get on top of the investigation in a timely manner -- to get it investigated in a timely manner in order to assess the risk to children and to a void hysteria, media sensationalism, and cross- contamination of information. The team appro ach reduces stress on individual investigators, allowing for peer support and minimizing feelings of being overwhelmed. The team approach and working together does not mean, however, that each discipline forgets its role and starts doing the other's job. Summary . The investigation of child sex rings can be difficult and time consuming. The likelihood, however, of a great deal of corrobor ative evidence in a multivictim/multioffender case increases the chances of a successful prosec ution if the crime occurred. Because there is still so much we do not know or understand about the dynamics of multidimensional child sex rings, investigative techniques ar e less certain. Each new case must be carefully evaluated in order to improve investigative procedures. Because mental health professionals seem to be unable to determine, with any degree of certainty, the accuracy of victim statements in these cases, law enforcement must proceed using the corroboration process. If some of what the victim describes is accurate, some misperceived, some distorted, and some contamin ated, what is the jury supposed to believe? Until mental health professionals can come up w ith better answers, the jury should be asked to believe what the investigation can corroborate. Even if only a portion of what these victims allege is factual, that may sti ll constitute significant criminal activity."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Conclusion There are many possible alternativ e answers to the question of w hy victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true. The first step in fi nding those answers is to admit the possibility that some of what the victims describe may not have happened. Some experts seem unwilling to even consider this. Most of these victims are also probabl y not lying and have come to believe that which they are alleging actually ha ppened. There are alternative explanations for why people who never met each other can tell the same story. I believe that there is a middle ground -- a cont inuum of possible activit y. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be \"contam inated\" or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determ ine which is which. This can only be done through active investigation. I beli eve that the majority of victims alleging \"ritu al\" abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma. That abuse or trauma may or may not be criminal in nature. After a lengthy discussion about various al ternative explanations and the continuum of possible activity, one mother told me that for the first time since the victimization of her young son she felt a little better. She had thought her only choices were that either her son was a pathological liar or, on the other hand, she li ved in a community controlled by satanists. Law enforcement has the obvious problem of attempting to determine what actually happened for criminal justice purposes. Therapists, however , might also be interested in what really happened in order to properly evaluate and tr eat their patients. How and when to confront patients with skepticism is a difficult and sensitive problem for therapists. Any professional evaluating victims' allegations of \"ritual\" abuse cannot ignore or routinely dismiss the lack of physical evidence (no bodies or physical evidence le ft by violent murders); the difficulty in successfully committing a larg e-scale conspiracy crime (the more people involved in any crime conspirac y, the harder it is to get away with it); and human nature (intragroup conflicts resulting in individual self-s erving disclosures are likely to occur in any group involved in organized kidnapping, baby br eeding, and human sacrifice). If and when members of a destructive cult commit murders, they are boun d to make mistakes, leave evidence, and eventually make admissions in or der to brag about their crimes or to reduce their legal liability. The discovery of the mu rders in Matamoros, Mexico in 1989 and the results of the subsequent investigati on are good examples of these dynamics. Overzealous intervenors must accept the fact that some of their well-intentioned activity is contaminating and damaging the prosecutive poten tial of the cases wher e criminal acts did occur. We must all (i.e., the media, churches , therapists, victim advocates, law enforcement, and the general public) ask ourselv es if we have created an environment where victims are rewarded, listened to, comforted, and forgiven in direct proportion to the severity of their abuse. Are we encouraging needy or traumatized individuals to tell more and more outrageous tales of their victimization? Are we maki ng up for centuries of denial by now blindly accepting any allegation of child abuse no matter how absurd or unlikely? Are we increasing the likelihood that rebellious, antisocial, or a ttention-seeking individuals will gravitate toward \"satanism\" by publicizing it and overreacting to it? Th e overreaction to the problem can be worse than the problem. The amount of \"ritual\" child abuse going on in this country depends on how you define the term. One documented example of what I mi ght call \"ritual\" child abuse was the horror"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"chronicled in the book A Death in White Bear Lake (Siegal, 1990). The abuse in this case, however, had little to do with a nyone's spiritual belief system. There are many children in the United States who, starting early in their lives , are severely psychologically, physically, and sexually traumatized by angry, sa distic parents or other adults . Such abuse, however, is not perpetrated only or primarily by satanists. The statistical odds are that such abusers are members of mainstream religions . If 99.9% of satanists and 0.1% of Christians abuse children as part of their spiritual belief system, that st ill means that the vast majority of children so abused were abused by Christians. Until hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, the public s hould not be frightened into believing that babies are being bred and eaten, that 50,000 missing children are being murdered in human sacrifices, or that satani sts are taking over Ameri ca's day care centers or institutions. No one can prove with abso lute certainty that such activity has not occurred. The burden of proof, however, as it would be in a cr iminal prosecution, is on those who claim that it has occurred. The explanation that the satani sts are too organized and law enforcement is too incompetent only goes so far in explaining the lack of evidence. For at least eight years American law enforcement has been aggressively investigating the allegations of victims of ritual abuse. There is little or no evidence for the portion of their allegations that deals with large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized sata nic conspiracies. Now it is up to mental health professionals, not law enfo rcement, to explain why victims are alleging things that don't seem to have happened. Profe ssionals in this field must accept the fact that there is still much we do not know about the sexual victimiza tion of children, and that this area desperately needs study and research by rational, objective social scientists. If the guilty are to be successf ully prosecuted, if the innocent ar e to be exonerated, and if the victims are to be protected and treated, better me thods to evaluate and explain allegations of \"ritual\" child abuse must be developed or identified. Until this is done, the controversy will continue to cast a shadow over and fuel the back lash against the validity and reality of child sexual abuse.

Barnette 1943 Several people have expressed concern about the Supreme Court' s recent decision in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. Hialeah, regarding m unicipal bans on animal sacrifice, so I have taken it upon myself to review the decision and pr epare an analysis for this forum. If you want to review the decision for yourself, you can find it in Vol. 61 of the US Law Week , page 4587-4604. It includes the text of all the ordinances at issue in this case. It's not too hard to read, as Supreme Court decisions go. The oral arguments are summarized in 61 USLW at 3347. If anyone cares about my qualifications to perform this analysis, I am an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvani a. I am self employed in legal research. I am not a specialist in constitutional law, but I have some experience with civil rights and discrimination-related law. In law school, one of my courses was a seminar on religion and the constitution. As a contributing writer for a legal newsletter, I am responsible for summarizing recent federal personal injury cases, including Section 1983 cases like this one. I have performed research on several civil righ ts, discrimination, and constitutional law cases, and I have been published on the subject of sexual orientation discrimination. I will discuss in separate me ssages the factual background of this decision (what happened, what the ordinance says, etc), the legal back ground (the law of Free Exercise, previous decisions in other cases), the procedural background (lower co urt opinions, oral arguments), and finally the reasoning of the c ourt and the concurring opinions. I should note at the outset that, al though several different opinions were published in this case, and the judges were not in complete agreem ent on the rationale behind the decision, all 9 Justices agreed that the Hialeah ordinances were unconstitutional. I have taken great care to orga nize my paragraphs by subjec t matter, so you can skip over those paragraphs you are not interested in. Factual Background The Lukumi religion is a blend of Roman Catholicism and the religion of the Yoruba region of West Africa. In the 19th century, when the Yoruba were brought to Cuba as slaves, they absorbed some elements of Roman Catholicism. The melded religion is generally known as Santeria. Santeria involv es the worship of orishas, which ar e powerful but not immortal spirits dependent upon animal sacrifices for their survival. The religi on was brutally suppressed in Cuba. Many of its modern practitioners ar e Cuban exiles living in South Florida. Sacrifices in the Santeria religion often incl ude many animals at a time. Animals sacrificed include various birds, sheep, goats , and turtles. The neck of the animal is punctured by a knife and the blood is drained. This method kills by severing the carotid arteries. For comparison purposes: shechita (Kosher slaugh ter) involves the simultaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument , and is approved as humane. Th e trial court in this case found that the Santeria method of sla ughter is \"less reliable, and ther efore not humane.\" The animals are normally cooked and eaten af ter they are sacrificed."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"In 1987, a Santeria priest planned to establish a church in the c ity of Hialeah, Florida. A few weeks later, the city council held an emer gency public session. The minutes of that session show significant hostility to th e Santeria religion. A councilm an said, \"if we could not practice this [religion] in [Cuba], why bring it to this country.\" Another said that Santeria is \"in violation of everything this country stands for.\" Another said he wa s \"totally against the sacrificing of animals.\" One asked, \"What can we do to prevent the Church from opening.\" A chaplin described the religion as a sin, the wors hip of demons, and advised the council to help people find Jesus Christ. As a result of this session, th e council passed several ordinances affecting Santerian practices. On the day of the session, the council passed an ordinance adopting th e state's cruelty to animals law. The preamble clearly indicated that the city's intent was to prevent \"certain religions\" from performing animal sacrifices. The city then obtained an opi nion from the state Attorney Ge neral saying that the state's anticruelty law would prohibit ri tual animal sacrifices. Based on that opinion (which is not \"the law\" BTW -- it's just an interpretation by the state's highest pros ecutor), the city passed the four ordinances at issue in this case. Res. 87-90 stated that people will be prosecuted for \"ritual sacrifices of animal s.\" Res. 87-52 prohibited the possession of animals with the intention of using the animal for food, specifi cally stated that this applied to people who planned to use the animal for ritual sacrific e regardless of whether the animal was actually consumed, and specifically exempted any \"license d establishment\" permitted to slaughter for food purposes under the zoning laws or other state or local la ws. Ord. 87-71 prohibits animal sacrifice generally. Ord. 87-72 pr ohibits slaughter of animals outside of a properly zoned slaughterhouse. All of these ordinances define sacrifice as \"to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture or mutilate an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption.\" The definition of \"unnecessary\" is critical here. Hunting, fishing, slaughter for food, eradication of pests and insects, and eu thanasia were all apparently considered necessary. Even the use of live rabbits to tr ain greyhounds for racing was deemed necessary. Animal sacrifice for religious purpose s, however, is deemed unnecessary. The church brought a Section 1983 action against the city and its officials, requesting a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional, an order preventing enforcement of the statute, and money damages. A Section 1983 act ion is a lawsuit under 42 USC Sec. 1983, an all-purpose federal statute creati ng a legal action against the st ate or people acting under its apparent authority for any violation of constitutional rights. Rodney King's action against the Los Angeles police, for example, is a Section 1983 action. Legal Background The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, among other things, that Congress shall make no law respecting an esta blishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. These are rea lly two separate rights: the right to be free from state-imposed religion (the Establishment Clause) and the right to practice your religi on without interference from the state (the Free Exercise Clause). The present case involves the Free Exercise Clause. The First Amendment does not apply directly to the states; it app lies only to Congress. However, over the last century, the Supreme Co urt has \"incorporated\" ma ny (but not all) of"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"the rights under the first 10 amendments into th e due process clause of the 14th Amendment, which does apply to the states. The religi on clauses were inco rporated in 1940. None of our constitutional rights are absolu te. When a case involves infringement of high- order rights, such as free speech and freedom of religion, the Supreme Court traditionally held that the government must have a compelling interest in the subject matter which overrides the religious freedom. West Va. B d. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943) (J ehovah's Witness punished for refusing to salute the flag); Sherbert v. Verner (1963) (7th Day Adventist denied unemployment compensation because she refused employment that required her to work on Saturdays); Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) (Amish p unished for refusing to send their children to public secondary schools). In recent years, the \"compelling state intere st\" standard has been (IMHO) watered down. For example, see Goldman v. Weinberger (1986) (Orthodox Jew discharged from army for wearing unauthorized headgear, a yarmulke). The court more or less assumed that the army's interest in uniformity of dre ss was compelling, and refused to question the army's judgment in this matter. The last Free Exercise case before the Supreme Court was Empl oyment Division, Oregon Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith (1990), a hi ghly debated case involving the denial of unemployment benefits to Native Americans w ho were discharged for using peyote in a religious ceremony, a violation of Oregon's dr ug laws. The Supreme Court upheld the denial of benefits, holding that generally applicable criminal laws that incidentally affect religious practices need not be supported by a compelling st ate interest. This is in accord with much older Supreme Court precedent, such as Reynolds v. United States (1879) (Mormon polygamists convicted of transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes). Procedural History After trial, the district court found the ordi nances constitutional. The district court acknowledged that the ordinances were not \"r eligion-neutral\" and were prompted by the establishment of the Santeria church, but found th at the ordinances did not target religion \"on their face\" and that the regulation was incidental to compelling secular purposes, specifically: the health risk caused by th e unsanitary conditions under whic h the animals are kept and disposed of; the emotional harm to children watching animal sacrifi ce; the protection of animals from cruel and unnecessary killing; and the restriction of slaughter to areas zoned for that purpose. The court held that these secu lar interests fully jus tified the prohibition of animal sacrifice. Notably, this case was decide d before the Supreme Court's opinion in Smith. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirm ed the decision in a one paragraph opinion adopting the district court's opinion, except for th e part about the emotional harm to children. It held that Smith had no effect on the result because the district court applied a stricter standard than the one required in Smith. Before the Supreme Court, the Santeria church argued that these ordinances were express discrimination against a minority group. Th ey noted that the ordinances prohibit \"unnecessary\" killing of animals, and the onl y way to prove that animal sacrifice is \"unnecessary\" is to prove that Santeria is a false religion, something that the court is not empowered to do under the Establishment Clause. They noted that if the ordinance has a non- religious purpose, then it is underi nclusive to effect that purpose , because it excludes virtually"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"all other types of killings. They disti nguished Reynolds (Mormon polygamy) in that polygamy laws have a long history and the la w affected the practices of non-Mormons. Finally, they noted that the state's interest s expressed by the dist rict court were not particularly compelling and the ordinances di d not significantly reduce the problems that the ordinances were supposedly targeted at. The city's argument emphasized the importan ce of disease control. They claimed that narrower ordinances regarding disposal of anim al remains would not be workable. A broader ordinance, encompassing hunting, fishing and euth anasia, was not necessary because they had not caused problems. The city admitted that under the ordinances as drafted, sacrifice would not be permitted even if conducted in a licensed sl aughterhouse. The city stated that killing of rodents and pests would not be prohibited, and waivered on the question whether cooking lobster would violate the ordinance (they ar e cooked alive, you know -- quite cruel). Supreme Court Opinion The opinion of the court was delivered by Ju stice Kennedy. All 9 Just ices agreed on the outcome of the case: the ordinances were uncons titutional, were not religion-neutral and were not justified by a compelling gove rnmental interest. The Justices differed, however, on the standards to be applied in this type of Free Exercise case. Justice Kennedy stated that if a law is not religio n-neutral and of general applicability, then it is invalid unless supported by a compelling intere st and narrowly tailored to advance that interest. To determine whether the ordinances were religion-neutral, the cour t looked first to the text of the ordinances. The text suggested that the laws were not religion-neutral, because they used religion-oriented terms like \"ritual\" and \"sacr ifice.\" But these words can have a secular meaning and are defined without reference to religion. Even if the laws were neutral on their face, the court concluded th at the facts clearly demonstrated the object of the laws was suppres sion of Santeria worship. The text of the preambles and the effect of the laws clearly in dicate this purpose, said the court. The laws were carefully written to exclude any kind of kil ling of animals other than religious sacrifice. The court noted that the law was \"gerrymandere d,\" carefully cut up to produce the result of suppressing Santeria sacrifice without affecting any other animal killing. The court repeatedly referred to Kosher slaughter, wh ich is religion-related and in some sense a ritual, but is conducted primarily for the purpose of food. Th e ordinances, particul arly Res. 87-52, are carefully written to include Santeria sacr ifice while excluding Kosher slaughter. The court also noted that the statute's use of the word \"unnecessary\" devalues religious reasons for killing by deeming them less necessary than secular ones. The court found the statutes to be overinclusive . Prevention of improper disposal, rather than prevention of sacrifice, could have solved mo st of the health problems. Laws regarding animal care and treatment could reso lve the animal cruelty problems. The court looked at the events leading up to the passage of th ese ordinances, and used this information as proof of the statut e's lack of religion-neutrality."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Having concluded that the laws were not religio n-neutral, the court questioned whether they were laws of general applicab ility. The court found that they were not, because they were underinclusive: they prohibited animal sacrifi ce for cruelty reasons, but did not prevent other killings of animals, such as killing rodent pest s, hunting, and so forth. The city did not justify these exclusions, insisting that they were \"obviously justified.\" They were also underinclusive with regard to public health, because hunting and restaurants can pose the same risks of improper disposal. The city also fa iled to justify other exceptions. Having determined that the ordinances were neither religion-neut ral nor of general applicability, the court turned to the questi on of compelling governmental interest. It concluded that the standard of compelling inte rest was not met because the statutes were overinclusive and underinclusi ve, as discussed above. Justice Scalia wrote separately to clarify the definitions of \"neutrality\" and \"general applicability.\" He thought the majo rity blurred the distinctions. He also noted that he rejected the analysis into the motivati ons of the law-makers as improper. Chief Justice Rehnquist joined this opinion. Justice Souter wrote separately to express hi s disapproval of the Smith test. He opined that religion neutrality alone was not sufficient to validate a st atute; however, given that the ordinance in this case was not religion neutral an d did not have compelling state interests, he joined in the result. Justice Blackmun also challenged the holding in Smith. He would hold that any statute that is not religion neutral or of genera l applicability is violates the Free Exercise Clause, regardless of whether there is a compelling state interest . Compelling state interest enters the picture only if the statute is religi on-neutral. This opinion was joined by Justice O'Connor. To summarize the rule of law stated by the Justic es: 6 Justices agreed with the Smith rule, that religion-neutrality and general applicability are sufficient conditions for constitutionality. Two of those six differed from with the major ity's approach to \"religion-neutrality\" and \"general applicability.\" Three Justices disagr eed with the Smith rule. One of those three would hold that religion-neutrali ty is not sufficient; compelling state interests must be found in any case. Two of those three would hold that religion-neutral ity is a necessary condition for constitutionality, and any statut e that is not religion-neutral is unconstitutional by definition. Comments It should be noted, for those who expressed such concerns, that none of the opinions in this case would permit human sacrifi ce. Prohibition of murder is religion-neutral, which alone would be sufficient under the Smith test adopted by 6 of the 9 Justices. Even under the stricter tests applied by Souter, Blackmun and O'Conno r, human sacrifice would not be permitted because the state has a compelling interest in preserving human life, which it enforces in a religion-neutral manner.

Having read he r recent book Gods and Beasts: the Nazis and the Occult , I found myself forced to the conclusion that her perspective is distorted due to insufficient exposure. The facts she presents ar e correct, and so are he r conclusions about the dangers of occult thinking insofar as they appl y to the kinds of organizations which form the basis of her research. It is evident, however, that she has never enc ountered a genuine Black Magical order. This essay is therefore inte nded not as a rebuttal of her views but as supplemental to them. In his Politics , Aristotle presents opposing arguments on the na ture of distributive justice from the perspective of the democrat and the oligar ch. The democrat says, in effect, \"We should have the main voice in the operation of our poli tical system, because we make the greatest contribution to it. We provide the artisans and laborers for commerce and public works, and we provide the warm bodies to man the armies and navies that mainta in our independence.\" To which the oligarch would reply: \"No, we make the greater contribution. It is we who provide the wealth, who meet th e payrolls, and who finance the public works, armaments, and ships; so we are the ones who should be in charge .\" Aristotle's point is that neither argument is valid, because neither actually kno ws what a political system is for . Both are proceeding from arbitrary assumptions which have nothing to do with the actual purpose of a political system. My own point is that Ms Sklar evidently does not know what a ma gical order is for. Classification: V5 - 366.C - 1 Author: L.

But there are two main avenues of approach, based upon differing concepts of the meaning of deification. For th e purpose of convenience in this essay, I will label them the White and Black sc hools of esotericism. Since th is is not intended to develop into a book, the descriptions which follow are ne cessarily somewhat simplistic; but they are applicable not only to esoteric orders but to ex oteric religions as well. The ultimate aim of the White school is the union (or re union) of the human mind with the non-c onscious, mechanical order of the Universe (also referred to as \"nat ure\" and \"God\"). Its methods and hierarchies are appropriately mechanical, leading in the direct ion of mental stasis and the inhibition of creative thought. Deviations from accepted norms are not permissi ble; absolute obedience to superior authority is mandatory; and every effort is made to represent the mind of man, which is the only thing capable of separating itself from the natural order, as an integral part of that order. The Black school, epitomized by the Temple of Se t, strives toward an increasing intellectual separation from the restrictions of the material universe, and toward the ability to manipulate universal laws according to man's own will. Creativity and innovation are highly prized, and administrative systems are as flexible as possi ble in order to encourage and facilitate the development of the individual. The majority of people are content (or preoccupied) with life as they find it, and are not particularly fond of mental exertion; he nce the Black school is necessarily selective and el itist. The stress upon individua lism also makes it basically incompatible with mass movements. There are five principal causes for the fa ilure or dissolution of magical orders: (1) Disparity between the stated and actual purposes and practices of the order. If an activist political society or a free-sex club is organized which employs a little esoteric jargon and ritual as its rationale, it is bound to fail because it is technically not a magical order at all. It is still a political soci ety or a sex club. (2) Substitution of subjective, emotional desi res for objective reality. This was one of the Nazis' principal shortcomings. They decided that the world was what they wanted it to be, and they deliberately fostered the revival of the most compulsive myths and archetypes of the Germanic peoples. This sort of fantasy can be enjoyable and harmless, but the Nazis applied it to the entire spectrum of physical and statisti cal science. Accordingl y, as the myths of race and blood and the Welteislehre pseudoscience of Hoerbiger ga ined in popularity, the Reich lost its Einsteins -- and the genuine scientis ts and scholars who remained were severely hampered in their pursuits by the requirement th at their doctrines and principles conform to Nazi orthodoxy. (The phenomenon is not unique to Germany. Consid er the restrictive effects of Marxist \"political mythol ogy\" upon Soviet science.) (3) Abandonment of original principles. Th e original goal of i ndividual evolution, the advancement towards an apprehension of the Pl atonic Forms, degenerate s into the expedient virtu of Machiavelli. Personal deve lopment is difficult, hence power over others comes to be viewed as an acceptable and accessible alternative. The result is internal strife, factionalism, and fragmentation of the order. If organiza tional cohesion is somehow maintained, genuine magical work will still be impossible. As an example, look at the Chinese Triad Society. It began as a genuine esoteric order founded by refugee Shaolin monks to carry on the essence of the monastery. As a White (Buddhist) school, it also wished to restore the \"divine\" Ming"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Dynasty, and it eventually became totally political with only a veneer of true esotericism. It still exists today, but onl y as a rough cultural equivalent of the Mafia. (4) Development of personality cults: the substi tution of the \"Fuehrer principle\" for internal government and administration by established law a nd principles of justice. This led to the downfall of Aleister Crowley's Order of the Silver Star, as the entire organization was bound so tightly to his own authorit arian personality that it could not survive. He had made no adequate provision for the selection of successors , and most of the order's prominent members were more personal fans than magicians. The same applies to another order over which he assumed control, the German Ordo Templi Orien tis or Order of Oriental Templars. At the present there are numerous offshoots of th e parent organization, each claiming sole authenticity. Political examples also abound, su ch as the fragmentation of the empires of Alexander and Charlemagne and the rapidl y-shifting regimes of Latin America. (5) Mixture of Black and White principles. Ma gical orders have gene rally been successful to the extent that they have embodied such Black elem ents as elitism -- genuine, as opposed to mere assumption of superiority -- and the fost ering of individualism. Totalitarianism and absolute conformity are hallmarks of the White approach, and Ms Sklar rightly warns of the dangers involved. The application of White prin ciples led to the murder of up to 13 million Europeans accused of heresy in the Middle Ages . It led to the murder of 6 million Jews in recent years. And the implications of such contemporary cults as Scientology, est, and the \"Moonies\" are indeed disturbing. It can be argued that these groups utilize \"b rainwashing\" techniques to change the thought- patterns of their converts (as brought out by William Sargant in The Mind Possessed and in Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of Conversion and Brainwashing ). But given the absence of total control of the convert's environment (as in North Korea in the 1950s), one could also argue that those who are convert ed are predisposed a nd willing \"victims\" who in most cases fit the profile of Eric Hoffer's \"true believer.\" They are dissatisfied with their lives, and just can't wait for an opportunity to dissolve their egos, abandon their responsibilities, and let someone else -- an evangelist, for instance -- tell them what to think and make their decisions for them. Their insecurity may be augmented by a logarithmically a dvancing technological society with which they find themselves increas ingly unable to cope. Bu t on the whole, \"true believers\" are sustained (and perhaps created) by the White approach to moral and political thought and behavior. When one considers the grip in which the Judeo-Christian system with its arbitrary standards has held Western civilization for so long, the wonder is that there are not more of them. The true believers will mo st likely be with us always, but the Black Magician -- intellectually indepe ndent, master of himself, and di recting the course of his life as he chooses -- will rema in virtually invisible. If from some of my illustrations, as perhaps from Ms Sklar's own examples as well in her chapter on the dangers of occult thinking, the di stinction between polit ics and magic appears to be somewhat blurred, it is because the relationship is a close one. Magic need not intrude into political life, but political art (involving the recognition, definition, and application of principles governing interactiv e systems of intell igent individuals -- beyond any ideology, beyond any given cultural environment, beyond a ny specific time-period or geographic locus) is indispensable to the magician. No magical order can be sustained for long without it, and this is why most orders have been short-lived."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"An intriguing exception to the rule is the or iginal Priesthood of Set, the most ancient god- entity of Egypt. Ancient Egyptian politics was an extension of th e esoteric principles of its priesthoods into mundane affairs. And t hough the Setian Priesthood was exterminated by Osirian persecution during the XXV Dynasty, E gypt was a viable nation (indeed, the first true nation, as opposed to city-state ) for three thousand years. A Test of Adept Knowledge Introduction Towards the end of his tenure as High Priest , Magus Ronald K. Ba rrett decided that the Temple's Recognition of Adepts was too la x, that many magicians had been Recognized Adept who were not Adept in Magus Barrett's opinion. He felt that the standards of the II° needed to be increased. He therefore devised the \"test\" which follo ws. This test was de signed \"to gather a comprehensive picture of your knowledge and Unde rstanding of the Magi ckal Arts.\" It was originally planned that all II I° Priests would take the exam , and that they would then administer the test to the Adepts of the Temple , and that they would afterwards administer the test to all I° Setians wishi ng to be Recognized Adept. Magus Barrett distributed the test to all Priest s of the Temple, and several Adepts were also given the test. It is my understa nding that few of the Priesthood were able to complete the test within Magus Barrett's 90-day time limit, and of these few, only one or two (if any) \"passed\" the test to Magus Barrett's sta ndards. I also believ e that not one single Adept of that time \"passed\" the test. Magus Barrett resigned from the Temple before re turning the test to most of the testees. They were returned by Dr. Aquino to all who remain ed within the Temple following the Set-IV crisis. This \"test\" now has no official standing within the Temple of Set. It is not used as part of the Recognition process for II° Adepts or any other degree.

Homosexuality in Magic Homosexuality over the centuries and Aeons has arisen as an issue many times and in different ways for many different reasons. It has found itself around primitive campfires and clothed in the purple of the Caesars. It has stood in near attendance to and sat on the Roman pontiff's very throne. Warriors alone and at wars far from their homes have known it, as have islands isolated by vast miles of oceans. It is alive in today's society, whether looked for in teeming cities or remote farmhouses. It will be found still in the unborn future of man, so long as he exists as an in telligent and separate species. And just as it has found its way to the sundry levels of Christianity's denominations, it lives on in various magical organizations still over the years. Whether it was (and is) treated as a matter of fact, a thing to be spoken only in whispers, or as a component supposedly pleasing to some debased fiend, it remains present as a factor side by side with heterosexuality. The Church of Satan found itself with a num ber of homosexual members, each of whom entered for various reasons. To some the reason for entry was the magical impetus and acute sense of life within the Church; for others it was a somewhat perverted idea that their sexual impulses would be catered to. These latter in evitably found themselves disappointed when 6114's response turned out to be something othe r than the expected one. Those acting in a more positive way found the Church's outlook a be neficial one, as in an article entitled The Homosexual Satanist , found in an early copy of the Cloven Hoof .

However, some of the former C/S members in the Temple mi ght be able to research this if anyone is interested.) The article is a restatement of the passage from the Satanic Bible dealing with \"Satanic Sex,\" and it is a good message to k eep in mind not only c oncerning homosexuality, but regarding any number of things that ma y arise and impact on one's personal life. Sexual orientations do not appear to be learned. One is born as heterosexual or homosexual or bisexual. It is possible to move more or less freely among those as desired for any number of reasons; more often it is a move made as a resu lt of perceived internal or external pressures [environment and so on], and therefore is marked by a certain constraint. Such moves or the lack of them are entirel y the affair of the individual ma king the decision. The Temple of Set does not presume to tell its Init iates how to manage their pers onal lives. Like being born heterosexual, originating as homosexual simply happens -- like the rest of those happenings in the world it must take place either as a Willed occurrence or as an incidental accident of more or less random chance. The actual problem comes not in itially from within, but rath er as a result of outside influences. The narrow and threaten ed minds of the world begin to attach labels to far more individuals than the homosexual, but he remains one of their favorite targets. He may be taught that he is abnormal, immoral, and account able for what is beyond his control, and is conditioned from the start for a strong and deep ly rooted case of guilt if brought up in less than enlightened environments. Several authors have remarked in studies that even an open and non-indoctrination type home life still did not completely rule out adjustment difficulties later in life. The point of going into this is that the homosexual Magician star ts out early with a challenge facing him early in life from parents and peers; he must learn to adapt himself and his environment to ensure optimum survival. Is the later confrontation of the soul with freedom made then any easier, or conversely more difficu lt, as a result of that premature encounter with the resistance of the natural universe a nd a portion of its populat ion? I suspect that indeed it is, and that once the restraints others attempt to impose are recognized as intrinsically empty threats, there may conceivably be the likelihood of slightly smoother sailing. No orientation makes for a de facto assurance of success, but certain constituents of the complete self can be made into positive tools. It becomes amusing on occasion to observe the antics of wiccan and associated groups when faced with the question of homosexuality and their own types of magi c. The unsure silence that comes about tends to suggest a deeper pr oblem than one of theology; in other words, methinks they do protest too much! On the ot her side of the scale are wiccan/pagan/etc. homosexual activists who take fi ery issue with all-heterosexual advocates. Neither of these is the proper concern of the Temple of Set, but it is now and then enjoyable to get popcorn and a ringside seat for watching the fights. Perhaps the general idea of homosexuality a nd Left Hand Path magic comes from such sources as the depictions in La Bas and similar fantasies. Even Ipsissimus Aleister Crowley described homosexuality as a perversion, although he certainly had no compunction about indulging in that perversion for his XI Worki ngs. Was he compromising? I think not. Crowley spoke of himself as having a feminine personali ty capable of actions of its own, and further having a definite place in his magical Worki ngs. He could be vociferous enough about things he did not like or approve of, and since ther e is minimal condemnation of homosexuality in"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"his writings, one may deduce that he received a great deal of not only magical but also physical pleasure from such acts. The masculin e Crowley may have spoken of perversion, but the feminine side of him was never too far beneath the surface. The Magus of the Aeon of HarWer may have had his confused and mistaken moments, but his clarity of vision pointed out in unequivocal terms the enormous power of sexual Workings, and that at certain times under certain circumstances a homosexual Work ing could generate the perfect impulse needed to get the job in mind done. The writings left us by our magical predecessors will touch on homosexuality here and there, and boil down to two main outlooks. Number one, homosexuality is abnormal, an offense against nature and God, and num ber two, it is acceptable in th at it is a part of some individuals' personal makeups. It is therefore either condemned or accepted, but regardless, there is a rarely openly spoken of between-the-lines subtraditi on to be found in both schools, suspecting that the homosexual magician can possibly access magic more easily than his heterosexual counterpart. Is there any truth in this? I am not prepared to pontificate on this particular point; rather it is offered as a subject for discussion. Each of us has masculine and feminine personality traits, and there are times when the masculine is more pronounced, while at others the feminine holds greater sway -- regardless of gender. C ould this assist the homosexual magician in successful Workings? Perhaps so. (And keep th at \"perhaps\" in mind -- remember, I will not pontificate here.) Homosexuality, if seen in the natural paths and plans of the Cosmos, is not a normal thing. But neither is life nor thought, for that matter, and one of the ways in which we who are Setians perform our magic is to work and Work in a manne r contrary to the Greater Law of the Cosmos. We are ther efore acting in a non-natural way. While this is not to say that the mere presence of homosexuality makes a super-magician, it is worth noting that such a factor is yet another daily resi stance to the Greater Law. Practice makes strength in such a case, and that it may be that a magician alr eady accustomed to thwarting nature's laws may find other accomplishments somewhat suggestive of methods successfully used in the past to bring about change and adaptation in accord with Will. Granted, the former experiences will have been on a differently keyed level, but nonetheless the individual presence of being is there. When attending a psychic seminar in Atlanta some years back, I was taken off to one side and asked, \"What about homosexuality in the Temple of Set?\" My response was, \"What about it?\" I confess to not having given a great deal of thought to the matter prior to that. My outlook was (and is) straightforward: if you want to do it and the other person, regardless of gender, also wants to, go ahead. (Simply use such precau tions as are appropriate to ensure optimal health.) The same attitude prevails within the Temple of Set; we have magicians, not cliques whispering this or that about other cliques. It makes for good Working relationships to follow such precepts and approaches; regardless of th e individual magician's sexual tendencies, the magic will work. The author of this piece, be ing most notoriously dour and puritanical, of course knows nothing of any of these matters. "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" Rite of Setian Passage The ritual area is set up with an altar containing the following: a source for the black flame, an aluminum foil baking dish on a hot pad, candles as needed for light, a censor that can be moved about the chamber, myrrh, frankincense, a nd incense pellets, the blue feather of Maat, and the bell. In the center of the chamber is an oblong narrow table, draped in black, representing the coffin. Upon it is placed a pa inting of the name of the deceased, and the funeral boat that carries the soul to the Tuat. It will be commende d to the abyss (the flame) at the Working part of the rite, much as the Viki ng tradition of setting the funeral boat afire. Four Setians mark the cardinal points and sta nd beside the coffin. Each represents a neter associated with the tradition of the canopic jars (the jars cont aining the vital organs). They hold one unlit candle each, and have a protective role toward the deceased. A fifth Setian is robed in black, and his head is completely cove red by a black cloth or hood. He/she represents the shadow of the deceased, and stands at the foot end of the coffin. The celebrant speaks for the ne xt of kin in this rite. Proclamation of Purpose “Brothers and Sisters of Set. Hail to our Prince the Lord of Darkness! In his Name we link hands across the Aeons. From the ancient times we bring forth this memorial rite, and see it through the eyes of Set.” “It was believed among the ancients that the d eceased did not embark upon the final journey until the funeral rites had been performed in their name by those closest to them. Let us remember our brother Adept Rick Furgeson, and bid him farewell with this rite.” “In a letter from his best friend, Setian Kevi n DeLong, we learned of the last days of our brother. The portions of this r ite that speak of him personally are taken from the letter of Setian DeLong and the newspaper article that accompanied it.” “We first met him as a young man of 21 in New Orleans, for the unofficial gathering of Setians that replaced Conclave for that year.

Besides being courageous, it was said of him that he was always a very happy, sincere, compassionate person, whom everyone seemed to like.” “He is deeply mourned by those close to him. His friend Setian DeLong said in his letter that Adept Furgeson was given a Christian burial, because his parents didn't know of his membership in the Temple. It was, in his word s, not a fitting funeral. This rite then is ennacted to satisfy the needs of the Setian mourners and his best friend, who have come to us in Adept Furgeson's name, but more especi ally, to assist him in his journey.” Celebrant faces the assembled and raises arms. Celebrant says: ”Let us with spread wings hover over this one fr om our midst. Let us call his name one last time while we honor his memory. Let us protec t his shadow while his body changes, and his spirit departs upon the funeral barge. Let us perform the rite of passage, that he have company upon his last and most fearful journey in to the western lands of darkness, that he arrive safely among the Gods, and take his place amidst the shin ing Beings who wield their Will in full awareness of Who they are.” Incense Cense the ritual area with smoky myrrh, circli ng the table and the shadow. Celebrant says: ” Let the smoke rise from the funeral resin, the sacred myrrh of the embalmer and healer. Rise to the heavens, descend to the netherworld. Those who dwell therein, beware of this rite. With this smoke comes on e mighty in his Being, One of our own, Adept Rick Furgeson.” Bell Ring the bell. With each ring of the bell one line is read : ” Open your ears, daimons of the netherworld. Open your ears, you who speak in our name. Know that this one needs no words spoken for him. Hear the bell of his coming. He comes who speaks for himself. He comes who glories in his Be ing, and is himself a daimon. Make way, for he comes to work his Will among you.” Open the Gate The Guardian of the Gate pick s up the blue f eather and says: ” Behold the exacting feather of M aat.

Be mindful O Setian that this Flam e ever burn brightly within, that it may enliven you even as your eyes close for the last time.” Invocation to Set Celebrant says: ” The shadow of our brother Adept Rick Furgeson yet lingers, as the words of final farewell wait to be spoken.” He touches the shadow's left shoulder and the sh adow raises both arms for the duration of the invocation. “Brother Adept, greet the Prince of Darkness w ho now comes into this place of your final moments.” Celebrant or another speaks the Invocation to Set. Invocation to the Elementals Invocation to Maat: The Celebrant takes the blue feather and holds it over the painting, as he repeats the following he makes a slicing motion ju st once then slowly walks to the next side and does the same until all four sides have been visited and returns to the head position.

I have taken the left pa th with no certainty of what lay ahead. I have spoken with truth and clea r judgment, calling upon Maat. I beheld my subconscious in the angles of the Pentagram. I sought the integration of Self. I have cherished the love that was mine in this life. I have made Xeper my word of power. Its strength goes before me. I have honored the Nine and the Temple of Set. ” The Celebrant gives the feathe r to the shadow saying: “The weighing of life and love and works and soul is done. Let our brother accept the rewards of his Xeper.” Graal Ceremony Done by the Celebrant or a Graal Master. An incense pellet (fragrant oils and spices in wax) is placed in the censor. The Graal is filled with a rich flavorful drink containing a spice such as cinnamon. Hot apple juice with cinnamon is pr eferred. The censor is moved about the Graal and about the assembled and lastly the four Neters. Celebrant: “Behold the Graal of perfection, of challenge, of unspoken desire. It is the curse of the Setian who would drink and then forget the well from which its draught is dr awn. This elixir of life is consecrated in the sacred smoke of the ancie nts. This elixir comes from the fruit of immortality. It contains the fir e of the spice that defies death. We drink it now in fellowship, that our brother may begin his journey in it s warmth. Let he who shared our cup and drank with impunity know that none dare come against him on his journey. His Will be unconquerable as he strides among the Gods.” The Graal is shared by pouring into the indi vidual ones. When all are poured the cups are raised in toast (spoken by the Celebran t or Graal Master) before drinking: “Hail to the just, the noble, the steady of W ill, the one whose laughter was in true mirth and kindness. We drink to your memory and your Xeper, Adept Furgeson.” The Work Celebrant: “The time of departing is near; the heart grow s heavy, and the eyes grow dim of those who had no warning of your leaving.

When all are lit they speak in turn. “I am Selket, and my flame honors you who have ea ten the eye of Horus. Immortality is yours as you Will. You are a livi ng being like unto no other.” “I am Sothis, and my flame honors you who have de stroyed in your own life the lie that is Osiris and the aberrations that followed him.

You toast the Ae on with Set, and embrace him as friend. Timeless are the words you hear, and the glories see.” Celebrant: “Arise beloved brother. The rites have been accomplished.” Shadow: “I am ready to depart. Let Anubis appear.” Invocation to Anubis Celebrant: ” Behold Anubis, the Opener of the Way. You hold the keys to the netherworld.

The rest of the brethren assemble with arms outstretched. The papyrus is lit, and placed in the foil pan.

Recently an Adept asked me to explain this idea a nd its relevance to Setian Philosophy. To many sorcerers and witches of the L.H.P., the mathematical sciences appear dry and difficult. Yet Setians can find dark inspiration in this seemingly-secula r topic. In the last hundred years such obscure sciences have driv en a stake through th e heart of classical theology.

George Cantor died mad -- but no t until he had seen, grasped, and rigorously proven the existence of distin ct orders of infinity. Not all infinities are created equal! Aleph-Nought refers to the countably infinite. Yet it can be demonstrated that the number of points be tween any two points on a straight line exceeds the countably infinite -- they are uncountably in finite. This flavor of infinity is known as Aleph-One. Beyond is still another, transcending th e scope of all objects that might exist in the Universe; and this is Aleph-Two. The number of provably distinct Alephs is itself infinite. Cantor named these mind-boggling and eldritch ma thematical entities Transfinite numbers. Behold: the mind of a man has compassed the in finite, dissected it, named and numbered its parts! When the theologians are asked how finite beings can comprehend the Infinite -- and someone always does ask, for no one engages in theology except to claim supernatural sanction for his personal prefer ences and hangups -- they avow th at the Infinite is a nice guy who would never leave his creations in the dark, invoke \"mysteries\" or otherwise waffle shamelessly. It has been over a century since Cantor sorted this out and no theologian has taken the hint.

He finds, luckily, one sympathetic priest-teacher who does not accept the teachings of the peristyle as gospel, but who questions their va lidity and meaning. He yearns to enter the hypostyle (wh ile most of the other priests merely accept their position in the peristyle, ignoring the pot ential of the hypostyle). This priest, Pasab, likes to reexamine the meaning of the hieroglyphs. For example, the word/glyph medu is represented by a stick -- but w hy a stick? A stick is a dead thing with no more sap running through it. Are words the same -- empty, with no meaning? The medu neter (word of the god = the word or voice of the Essen tial Principle) was a twig with sap inside -- a living thing, a glyph that symbolized signi ficant meaning that has now been lost. This discussion of hieroglyphic meaning make s it painfully obvious that current thought regarding Egypt and its symbols is woefully one-dimensional; the Egyptian philosophy has been taken at face value without any attempt to search for deeper meaning, just as Pasab's companions refused to allow the possibility of deeper meanings. Her Bak does listen to Pasab, for he is a search er for the deeper meaning, for the Essential Principles. At the end of the book, the Sage brings him into the hypostyle for further initiation. Her Bak attempts to expose the reader to a new and infinitely more complex interpretation of Egyptian civilization as reflected in its life- pervading philosophy. The neter is found in all things, but it has been disreg ared by the ancient Egyptians (and modern Egyptologists). By reading Her Bak, once more you may begin to perceive the awesome Essence of Egypt. Arthur Machen's The White People Classification: V4 - 805.1 - 2 Author: L.

While the prologue to The White People stands pretty well on its own for the most part, it does fall short in significant respects which will be self-evident to III°+ Setian readers. Viewed in historical context, the scope of Machen's vision and its ultimate failu re can both be seen as almost inevitable. Arthur Machen was an initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Da wn, the British magical society in which Aleister Crowley re ceived his preliminary training. The G :. D :. was a White Magical Order in the precise sense understood by the Temple of Set, involved in the quest for initiatory harmony with the existing state of the natural universe. As such, its operative magical methodology and the state of being of its membership can be regarded as prototypically analogous to the II° of the Temple of Set. Machen's perception is built upon his esoteric background, and that same background explains its limitation: as Star Wars ' Darth Vader would express it, Machen was familiar with only the Light Side of the Force. Accordingly he could only conj ecture about the Dark Side. The White People is a conceptual examination of the nature of evil. Machen rejects as inadequate the traditional, primitive notion th at evil is necessarily antisocial or even destructive. Evil in its true sense consists in that which is outside th e natural order of the universe. Seeking to achieve harmony with th at universe, however, he makes two erroneous assumptions: that true evil must be unconscious of itself, and that the evil man will be an ascetic. Consciousness evolves through a synthetic proces s in the Hegelian sense via the comparison of contrasting data, beginning with the recogn ition of \"self\" and \"not-self.\" Awareness of oneself as an isolate identity, distinct and apart from the natural universe (i.e. \"God\"), is the original and most deadly si n, bringing with it the knowle dge of good and evil. Therefore religious systems have always attempted to submerge man's Self-consciousness and return him to unity with God. Sin is defined as being apart from God. For this state to exist and to persist, the conceptual tensi on between self and not-self, self and the universe, must be sustained by conscious effort. Otherwise the sinner does indeed lapse into a condition functionally indistinguishable fr om that of an ecstatic yogi or Christian mystic -- a saint by our description. Evil, in fact, must be aware of itself, for Self-a wareness is its essential nature. Machen, devoted as he was to Universal ha rmony, could not quite understand this. But that should not be surprising. He was unable to perceive the Dark Side, and could only hypothesize it as an inversion of wh at he knew, just as Christians seem unable to conceive of the Left-Hand Path as being anything but a ve rsion of their own simplistic myth-system in reverse. The saint, enraptured by the submersion of his personal ego in the Universal order, would be unconcerned with any single manifestation of th e universe. More appropriately, perhaps, he would be equally concerned with all. There would be no dis tinction of value between gold and brass, veal and hamburger; for all things are but manifesta tions of One. The universe is seen as a hologram, with the whole implicit in every part; he nce his passion for the Whole might well make him an ascetic, bu t not necessarily. Having achieved initial Self-definition by testing himself against and manipulating elemen ts of the natural universe, he would come to realize that these elements have no ultimate value in themselves. Yet he may assign relative values (which would vary with each individual) to them at will for instrumental purposes, and he might take great pleasure in playing with them:"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"23.

Ye shall see them at ru le, at victorious armies , at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this ... - The Book of the Law The astonishing extent of Machen's perception of metaphysical evil and his sustained interest in the occult evidence a spark of the Black Flame attempting, with only partial success, to fan itself into a blaze. To give him his due meed of praise, he sincerely tried. It is indeed more difficult to be a sinner than a saint. There are many today who are fascinated by the Dark Side at the same time that they inveigh against it. This affords them a degree of titillation at a \"safe\" distance. Even as they extol the virtue s of safety in the Garden, however, they are drawn by what may lie beyond its bounds. They venture near the border and then are frightened back into the ref uge of dogma; yet the lure of the unknown -- the potential for awareness and free will which is the true legacy of the Prince of Darkness -- persists.

HISTORY Someone Christ, King of the Jews"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" The name of Jesus of Nazareth, to put it mildl y, is one not unknown to Magical societies. We have all heard it, heard it, and heard it any num ber of times from any number of people, and in ways ranged from the best of intentions to threats. It gets no better as time passes and you progress. After all, Puritanism was once desc ribed as a terrible suspicion that someone somewhere might be happy, and the same applies equally to Christianity in general. But Christianity is not exactly an accurate way of getting a clear idea of the man Jesus. We have time and perspective on our side; with it let us take another look at this man and his own brand of magic. Traced back through forty grand and great-grand si res to Abraham, Jesus emerges as a rather nondescript infant born circa 30 ce, amid what has been calcul ated as the time of some spectacular astronomical displa ys. Described in Biblical commentaries as \"perhaps a miraculously governed meteor, star or comet,\" (1) the star of Bethlehem was more probably an alignment of the major planets or a supe rnova than any God-guided phenomenon. Still, no random association is too unbelievable when power seekers ply their trade on the sheep. Acts of irrational faith grant a ny number of illogical things the status of truth. The Bible itself tells us little of Jesus' childhood except for his city of birth, the alleged postpartum attendant marvels, and a rather unlikely story of the twelve-year old Jesus showing off before the learned heads of the Jeru salem temple. [It is possible he was what we now call \"street-wise\" , and may have had a first-hand picture of real life as opposed to theory, but it is doubtful he was able to trip up the Jerusalem philosophers . Intelligent he was, but that smart? No.] And yet, the temple incident is a foresha dowing of his ambition and future plans: And when they (Joseph and Mary) saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, \"Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold, in sorrow thy father and I have been seeking thee.\" And he said to them, \"How is it that you s ought me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?\" (2) The messiah, God's Chosen One, had been expect ed for years, and it was certainly a topic the young Jesus would have heard of. It may be that Mary (and possibly Joseph) planted the seeds of thought and ambition in him with tales of the s ky at the time of his birth. And even the tale of the Magi come from afar might have b een true. [Even we make mistakes at times. (3) ] Nonetheless, by age twelve the groundwork had begun, and not until about twenty years later would Jesus begin making the major errors which would lead to his deat h and the loss of his Mastery.

Certainly there would have been some religious and philosophical training along the way, and Essene thought seems to come through more or less subtly in the transcriptions of his sermons. (4) Regardless of what form of training he received, the result was that he emerged with his mission stil l in mind and began accumulating followers. At age thirty he was teaching and preaching at a full-blown rate. Twelve men formed the inner circle of his traveling c ourt along with camp followers st arting the outer circles. [And by the way, was he as pure as the driven snow? The question is an academic one at this point, but there are a few possibilities. In \"Manny Faces Life,\" a takeoff on the life of Jesus as performed by members of the then-Lilith Gro tto of New York, Manny (Jesus) informs Peetie- Baby (Peter) that he has \"a ni ce quiet arrangement with Mary Magdalene.\" Should Mary M. not have been available, there would have been other women willing to welcome the great Teacher into their arms. But the ladies may have been out of luck -- afte r all, he did prefer being around those twelve guys. The answer? A purely academic one.] Any reading of scriptures w ill point out a major P.R. tac tic: crowd-pleasing. The masses sought out this man Jesus on the basis of his reputation and their deep er need for a winning player in life's game, and Jesus presented hi mself as the answer. He formulated a philosophy and gave it a Word: Love. (5) He performed magics, or let the masses think he did, and expressed the thought trend of a people in a certain time. He saw with an almost global vision the patterns of events, and successfully manipul ated both people and happenings. He became, in a word, a Magus and personified the combini ng and resulting events and responses of his day. The truly Satanic configurations of his works testify to his understanding of humanity and the cosmos. His ultimate failure came about only through a loss of courage and perspective, thereby setting the stage for the absurd beliefs con tinually modified as convenient to our day. [As Magus LaVey has said, \"Not all vampires suck blood.\"] A number of the teachings of Jesus, in th eir own way, were well-meant and kindly ones. Though the manipulative aspects were not new, th ey were at times a more sympathetic and gentle approach to the Cosmos (or God) than were then generally expressed. The sermon on the mount may have been a masterpiece of the call for self-denial, and it certainly made a setting the crowds loved, but more importantly it portrayed the speaker as having the needed answers for the times. The puppet ma ster pulled all the right stri ngs at all the right times, and had, as John Fowles might put it, written a new mystery story. And what a mystery story it was. Not only did it have the appeal of the ge ntle and kind way of life, but it simultaneously taught obedience to the speaker himself. The t actic of \"You have heard ... but I say unto you ...\" is a neon sign reading \"L esser Black Magician\" from the first word. Here began the foundations from which the cross would be c onstructed: you may mani pulate to your heart's content, but remember that other manipulators ma y have something to say about it. [It is as the High Priest of Satan pointed ou t to his initiates, the world tends to be pretty Satanic on its own.] The philosophy behind Love became curiouser and curiouser, and continues so to this day. Around 30 ce or so it was different. If Gurdjieff and Ouspensky meant \"sleepers\" as those governed by instinct and logic, Jesus may be c onsidered to have been initially awake. Only when things began to get too big did he fall back into the category of sleeper and set his course for destruction. And yet he realized gen tle teachings would not necessarily result in a gentle people:"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Do you think that I came to give peace upon the earth? No, I te ll you, but division. (6) The philosophy of self-denial and a li fe of simple work with a tota l trust in the father-figure of God was well and fine. As we have seen, it not only created sheep but it made sure of the fact that they were obedient ones. Even the \"turn the other cheek\" instruct ion had a sound basis of keeping peace among the ranks. Like all the othe r teachings of Jesus, it too fell prey to convenient interpretation until it is held in contempt today. (7) In such a man as Jesus, the nemo would have held strong sway. The nemo is the subject of Negative Satanism , (8) and it appears Jesus took many opportunities to establish his being . By so doing, he also presented hims elf as having conquered the nemo, and like the dictators of the world, he found the crowds calling his name. (9) But it was not long until the tables were turned and the nemo had its revenge. It may be that the proximity in time of the raising of Lazarus from the dead (?) to the entry into Je rusalem caused the Osirian Magus to lose some touch with reality, but whatever , the game was suddenly in de ad earnest for all involved. Before making the last trek to the great ci ty, Jesus began making allusions to his coming death, and while it might have been that the ta lk of death and leavi ng was yet another P.R. tactic, this time aimed at his inner circle, it is equally possible that in taking himself too seriously, Jesus at that time began experiencing a sort of Fade to Black syndrome. (Jesus could be hurt, but not the Messiah.) From there things went from bad to worse, culminating in the arrest and trial before Pilate. Pilate, fee ling angry with the peopl e for placing him in the situation in which he found hi mself, was no happier when hearing the ambiguous answers Jesus gave. His last answer to Pilate, \"Thou wouldst have no pow er over me were it not given thee from above...\" is a display of the awarene ss of impotence. Formerly he could do all. Now he was a pawn in the hands of superior play ers. Matthew and Mark record the supremely agonized and bitter words springing from the nemo set at maximum: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Had he known what we know there would have been no need to ask. And the post-mortem appearances? We know that nothing is impossible, and therefore maybe the soul of this man did come back for more of that adulation he craved and was without in the end. It is more likely yet that the stre ss his followers underwent produced some rather comforting hallucinations as a result of emo tional / social pressu re and expectations. Whichever, the end result was th at any number of sugary little tales were spread about to cover the absence of the Christ, and the new religion was left to survive as best it could. With such strong advocates (= power seekers) as Paul , Peter, James, and others, the teachings of Jesus flourished ... as was convenient to the place and time. The rest you know. One wonders after reflection if Jesus is as bad as we sometimes see hi m. Certainly he is no personal friend of mine, but I thi nk John Fowles to have been on target when he wrote, \"It is not what Jesus made of mankind, bu t what mankind made of him.\" It is the followers of Jesus who make up the majority of the enemy, and not necessarily Jesus himself. Once we begin to gain an appreciation of the problems involved in Tasks and Curses, it may be that we can place blame where blame is due. Just as our livi ng thought is not sterilized by the dead hand, we need not disturb the dust. And here is the final thought: Dust may rest as dust with no objections from us, but that does not mean you have to be charitable when put upon by the rabble.

These ar e called Masters and are honored as being what the title says: one whose actions display a finely tuned sense of life and its intricate cause end effect actions. They may, as Dr. Aquino once wrote, be called Saints, Sages, Mahatmas, Medicine Men, Shamans, Witch Do ctors, or Philosophers. Regardless of the cultural title given, he is a Master. Within the halls of the Temple of Set and its predecessors, Master is equated with Master of the Temple a nd it is a past and rather unexpected holder of that stage of Initiation on whom th is article will turn its attention. The movie Gandhi of a few years back was not only an excellent production, but fairly accurate in dealing with the life and thought s of that Mahatma, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Based to an extent on The Essential Gandhi , an anthology edited by Louis Fischer, the film followed the progress of a determined man working in the face of years of tradition. To the eyes of the socially sensitive Kingsley portrayed an active force in the move for equality. That he did, but to the Initiate obser ving the process the film was pure Black Magic performed by a Master of the Temple. While it is true that Gandhi wa s not Satanic in the traditionally accepted sense of the word, his acti ons wave a banner that cannot be mistaken for the Right Hand Path. Born in October of 1869 ce, Gandhi was a cont emporary of Aleister Crowley and therefore moved from the Aeon of Osiris to that of HarWer with that Magus. There is no evidence to my knowledge that the two ever met, but they were both prominent Black Magicians operating in the same timeframe. Gandhi outli ved Crowley by a month, the latter dying in December of 1947 and the Mahatma in January of 1948. Although superficially there seems little in common between the two men, examin ing the deeper parallels reveals some surprising likenesses. Both fought for what th ey believed in and in their own unique ways sought Truth in the form which seemed right and just to them. Was there a Master of the Temple abiding in Mohandas K. Gandhi or was it simply a man restating Christian ethics taken to a higher degree than practice d by that religion? I think there was indeed a Magister Templi looking out of Ga ndhi's eyes and that his was a Black Magical approach to his personal and national search for Truth. Never did he advocate the pursuit of the knowledge of Satan or Set, teaching instead th at there is a single G od and that regardless of the name called by, the deity remained God. The Mahatma Gandhi was either a Black Magician and a Master of the Temple or he was not: There is no Right Hand Path avenue leading to the City of the Pyra mids wherein the Magistri dwell. Its gates and approaches are of the darkest black only. And yet no one springs forth fully born in that City where only adults abide Children must grow and find their own ways to its gates In the case of Gandhi, the basic ongoing determined actions seem to i ndicate the presence of something more then a follower of Osiris. Gandhi, as a Hindu, was married at age thirteen to a stranger who later stayed by his side through the thick and thin of his life's passion fo r the elevation of man. He was an intelligent and thoughtful child from the beginning and at age nineteen sailed for England to study law and was admitted to the bar (Inner Temple) in London at age twenty-one: It was in South Africa that he had the fateful encounter which the movie took pains to relate. Here are his own words to tell what his feelings were afte r having been tossed from his first class rail carriage for the crime of not being Caucas ian. Fischer relates in The Essential Gandhi what ran through the future Mahatma's mind while sh ivering in the rail station waiting room."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"\"There was a white man in the room; I was afra id of him. What was my duty, I asked myself. Should I go back to India or should I go forward, with God as my helper, and face whatever was in store for me? l decided to stay and suffer. My active non-violence began from that date.\" The pertinent point in relating th e event is that Gandhi, like all of us at various times in our lives, experienced a Day of Judgment at that moment. Alone with himself and the choices before him, he could only make a decision which would affect the rest of his life and I suspect that had he opted for going back to India his soul would have given him no rest until he returned to do the work his Will was carving out for him. Later in his life he would pen these words: \"T he life I am living is certainly very easy and very comfortable, if ease and comfort are a mental state. I have all I n eed without the slightest care of having to keep any pers onal treasures. Mine is a life full of joy in the midst of incessant work.\" It is a characteristic of the Ma ster of the Temple that he tends the garden of Initiates from the calm waters of Binah, the Sea of Understanding and like other Initiates works without a lust for results. He displaye d his understanding of th at clearly enough in a 1924 ce issue of Young India by saying, \"I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has gi ven me no control over the moment following.\" What would his wording have been had he st udied the heart of the Word Thelema? Like Gandhi, none of us can foresee the future, but we do have a certain amount of control over the moment following. While some of the wording may strike Initiates of this Aeon as having overlooked some of the finer points of Magic [as in the \"no control\" quote above], remember that the Mahatma was working in the early part of the Aeon of HarW er and while Thelema was making its force felt, it had not been expounded to him. Crowley wa s too busy doing other things around XX A.H., but had written before that Gandhi, among ot her of his countrymen, was in essence a renegade. It is a rather complimentary remark whether or not Ipsissimus Crowley meant it so. We are all in our own ways renegades from the established Thou Sha lt rules and feel, like Socrates' maxim, that the unexamined life is not worth living. It is that determination which made Mohandas Gandhi and Aleister Crowley rene gades to the rules of established custom and belief. There is a reason for the renegade st atus in the case of bot h men -- each envisioned a plan which seemed the best practical hope ma nkind could have for forming his future: Has either idea been successful? It is too soon to make the definiti ve analysis, but Crowley's has seemed to work for Setians. Gandhi's ideals rema in alive and his words conjure the image of a giant among his fellows. Like those of Jesus, howev er, they are often at odds with the reality which is practiced in the real world. \"Man's relation to the world should not be take n as extrinsic or accidental,\" wrote philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty in 1962 ce, \" but as essential to his bei ng.\" The quote is analogous to the words of Satan ArchDaimon in the Diabolicon : \"What, man, art thou? Why thy presence? Because thy own purpose determines that of th e Cosmos itself, though otherwise it may have been suggested -- the creation, perpetuation, and ex ercise of the Satanic marvel that is free and unbounded Will.\" Gandhi's relation to the worl d came to the forefront of his attention when the toss from the train incident took pl ace. It was but one example of the prevalent conditions of the day. Circa those days Crowle y related once having dressed in Indian garb and taken himself along a roadway only to be shoved aside by a British military man on horseback. Crowley laughed quiet ly to himself and continued his walk, knowing the rider never realized he had sworn at a fellow Englishman."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Years of English rule over India had conditioned both conque rors and the conquered to a fixed role of masters and slaves. The loss of freedom for the latter and the unthinking pressure exerted by the former promoted a stasis in which time froze and the conditions of the day could have resulted in only one of two ends -- either the national explosion which did come about or the worse fate of a mu tual fading of both societies as one eventually died out leaving the other without the source of service and goods it had depended on. In such a soil conditions were right for a gardener to tend the flowers in need of care. Gandhi was that one who arose to tend of the garden. \"Mine,\" he said, \"is a life full of joy in the midst of incessant work.\" His mastery of mysticism was evident is a calm, self-aware way: He was, he said, fascinated by the law of love and described it as his philo sopher's stone. He remarked in XVII A.H. that had he no sense of humor he would have committed suicide, a statement which displayed an understanding of the Law of Sorrow. His compre hension can be seen further in this quote. \"The purpose of life is undoubt edly to know oneself. We ca nnot do it unless we learn to identify ourselves with all that lives. the sum-tota l of that life is God. ... The instrument of this knowledge is boundless, selfless service.\" The Ae on of Osiris had given way to the new Aeon of HarWer and its ruling Word, Thelema. Agape had lost its preeminence and yet still had not died. It is almost, but not quite, a combination of the two concepts which he made in XL A.H. at the second anniversary of the \"Quit India\" movement: \"My work will be finished if I succeed in carrying conviction to the human family that ever y man or woman, however weak in body, is the guardian of his or her self-respect and liberty. Th is defence avails though the whole world may be against the individual re sister:\" The attempt to meld a workable combination of Love and Will was successful in his own case and to a certain extent for a percentage of his countrymen, albeit with less perm anence in the latter due to their lack of the vision evidenced by the Mahatma when he voice d the principle that \"If we are to make progress we must not repeat history but make new history. The IV° of today and that of the (8)=[3] of th e Aeon of HarWer are as different as propeller driven airplanes and supersonic jets. It cannot be otherwise if the level of knowledge and understanding continues to accelerate with c onstant Coming Into Being. Would there be a need of a Gandhi today? Such great ones arise at times of equally great need as a result of Initiation into the mechanics of the compleat life.

His journey through life began on October 2, 1869 ce and ended on January 30, XLIV A.H. His accomplishments were legendary even in hi s own day and the crowds gathered for his funeral rites were massive. Once he wrote of God that he had s een the noblest of attributes ascribed to God, but that he had in his youth ch osen the word \"truth\" to define the essential element of Godhood. He had said that God is Tr uth. \"But,\" he added about insights of 1929 ce, \"...I advanced another step. Now I see, Tr uth is God. For even atheists do not doubt the necessity for the power of truth. In their passi on for discovering the truth, the atheists have not hesitated to deny the existence of God, and, from this point of vi ew, they are right.\" \"The only virtue I claim,\" he said, \"is truth and non-violence.

It is in such a way that we Xeper and Remanifest ourselves. The Magical Legacy of H.P. Lovecraft I felt compelled to say a word or two about L ovecraft's importance to the Temple of Set, because this is the centennial of his birth. He has had an impact on many people, including members of the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set. His imagination influenced a variety of literary and artistic creations, and that influe nce has spilled over into the area of the occult. I think there may be a question, for Setians who have not read Lovecraf t: why is this author who is not an occultist, not a magician -- w hy are his stories on the reading list? Anyone who does read them will intuit the answer. Some haven't. One member of the Kaliyuga Pylon asked me, \"What about this Lovecraft guy? Wa s he a Satanist?\" Well, no -- he wasn't. But he was a philosopher. He created extremel y evocative and powerful fiction, a kind of fiction that does not fit into neat categories, though it has been classed as science fiction or horror. One literary critic who has analyzed Lovecr aft's work describes it as \"cosmic fiction\". I'd like to talk a bit about what cosmic fiction is, about Lovecraft's approach to the subjective and objective universes, how his innate talents an d the constraints of his environment came to produce a unique perspective, and how this f ound manifestation in his writing. Then I'll talk about what uses people have put this to, and how we see it wi thin the Temple of Set. Cosmic fiction, most simply put , is fiction that dwells on the relation betw een the human psyche and the cosmos. Now, writers always conv ey their philosophy -- it is always present in what they write. But cosmic fiction is distinct in that it is concerne d with the psyche, with meaning and the place of humans as generators of meaning in a cosmos which seems to be beyond all our comfortable categories -- about th e confrontation with the Beyond, the Other, the Unknown. Cosmic fiction is not just horror, because there is something more in Lovecraft's stories than merely the evocation of fear. It is not science fiction or fant asy, because the things Lovecraft Classification: V2 - 92I.L - 1 Author: Pat Hardy III° Date: October, XXV HTML Revision: September 2, XXXIII Subject: H. P.

They are explorations into the nature of the psyche, and Lovecraft pursued this expl oration to create certain effects. I should point out that his philosophy is one we would regard as anti-Setian. He was a materialist, a mechanist. As far as Lovecraf t was concerned, not only was the Universe devoid of any supernatural element, but human beings were the puppets of th is cosmos. In a much- quoted statement, he refers to \"the merciful inability of the huma n mind to correlate its contents.\" He believed that if humans reali zed they were puppets and blind images of the forces around them, it would be shattering. Now as Setians we say, surely the very insight in to this would indicate that the human was not part of that cosmos. How could you realize that you were a robot? To us this seems like an obvious paradox. Lovecraft didn't address this problem. As a ph ilosopher, he rejected human explanations of the role of humanity in the cosmos. He rejected traditional religion utte rly -- he regarded it (as we do) as a purveyor of soothi ng fictions. In letters to corre spondents, he wrote that he viewed the cultivation of personal values, aesthetic values, and the derivation of ethics that made life an affair as comfortable a possi ble given its essential meaninglessness, these were legitimate areas for humans to delve into. But th e universe itself was ultimately unfathomable, and human consciousness was like foam on a wave. Yet Lovecraft was a remarkable example of what humans can do in transcending the obvious limits. He did not seem to recognize this. Hi s subjective universe was extraordinary, so extraordinary that it produced literature whic h had a powerful effect on others. It is worth looking at the facets of this subjective universe. As far as innate factors went, Lovecraft was an extremely intelligent i ndividual. According to the biographer L. Sprague de Camp (RL #7A), at two he knew the alphabet. At three he began reading; at four he was writing. At fi ve he began reading The Arabian Nights . At six he was able to recite poetry, and had begun putting togeth er rhymes. It should be pointed out that he was not merely an idiot savant -- he had begun thinking about what he was reading. He rejected Santa Claus at the age of five, and told his parents that he was starting to have serious doubts about God. At seven he immersed himself in Greek a nd Roman myth, feeding his subjective universe with these images of beauty and power. He found these images so vastly enlivening and enriching, compared to the spiritual atmosphere of his surroundings, that he imagined that he must be surely be a pagan. L. Sprague de Camp reports that Lovecraft began to think that horns and pointed ears were sprouting, and he was disappointed that wi shing did not turn his feet into hooves. Nevertheless, in addition to this rich aesthetic so urce, he also turned to the sciences. At this time he lived in the house of his grandparents. They gave him a chemistry set, and he set out straightaway to making explosions and strange smells in the basement. His grandfather encouraged Lovecraft's scientif ic pursuits and his taste for the weird, telling him horror tales and folk legends. Lovecraft received his first telescope in 1903 at th e age of 13; shortly thereafter he began writing and publishing an astr onomy newsletter. He had an intense lust for knowledge. This translated into precise th inking, yet he had a powerful imagination."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"There are elements of his innate nature, a nd his physiology, which are peculiar. We don't know to whether these were side effects, illnes s, or mutation. We know that he possessed an extreme sensitivity to cold -- he was most lively at high temperatures, became lethargic in the 60's and 50's, and he actually collapsed at one point while walking with friends when temperatures were near freezing; he ha d to be taken indoors and revived. He was ravenous for sugar. He was nocturnal all of his life, at his liveliest at night. This is not uncommon for writers, but in him it was very pronounced. He had bursts of manic energy. There were occasions when, as an adult, he went to visit correspondents; they found him full of energy, enthused, running around for two days at a time without sleep. This behavior fascinated them, because of the contrast with Lovecraft's description of himself as very retiring, and with other reports de scribing him as a semi-invalid. It 's hard to say if this was psychosomatic. He was immune to poison ivy. And he had total recall. One thing historians have focussed on is that both his parents died violently insane in asylums. Some have suggested that Lovecraft' s extreme moodiness and cycles of ill health were due to syphilis. He had a Wassermann test at the time of his marriage. According to this test, he did not suffer from syphilis. We may be able to infer some hereditary component to his nervous sensitivity, and ther e is probably a powerful psychol ogical effect associated with the early stages of dementia in his parents. This added a further element for him to contend with in the formation of his psyc he and his view of the world. The death of his grandfather forced Lovecraft's family into a smaller flat in Providence. His father had already been hospitalized, and his mo ther moved in with two aunts. He regarded this as the end of a golden age in his ch ildhood. He dropped out after two years of high school, had a nervous breakdown, and never returned to his studies. He regretted this later; in his letters he wrote of his regret that he had not pursued his academic studies. For the rest of his life he never held a job, living almost all of his life with his two aunts. He briefly lived outside Providence, having gotten married and gone to live in New York City. However, he despised New York City, moved back to Providence, and got divorced. If this was all there was to say about the life of H.P. Lovecraft, there would be nothing to talk about. However, his writing, and his creativit y, proved to be the key. It brought him into contact with others, and caused him to have an effect on the objective universe -- it became the basis of a legacy bo th literary and magical. Now writing, and artistic creation generally, is a kind of mirror of the soul. You will find in art the specific characteristic s of the artist's subjective un iverse, not only in the themes pursued, but in the structure of the work, in the way that those themes are expressed and presented to others. Lovecraft's ta les show a number of features that are very tightly keyed to his subjective universe. Lovecraft tales focus on mood: th e building and cultivation of moods in his stories is the important thing. He's not concerned with plot as we generally understand it; his stories are remarkably consistent -- to the extent that a plot exists at all, almost all of his stories possess the same plot: a Rationalist Investigator stumbl es slowly but surely on shattering facts that unhinge his reason and blight the rest of his life! But he felt that the cultivation of the mood and the impressions was most critical, and in his letters one can see this. (1) Intensity of mood shows up in his letters in descri ptions of the"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"places he has visited. He hated travel, but when he did go -- to Boston, to New York City -- the intense clarity of observation and the recounti ng of moods, his reaction to all he has seen, is very marked. In comments on supernatural horror in literature, he states that the conveyance of mood is the most vital element. A second element is place-fixation. This ma y have grown out of his conviction that Providence was surely the hub of the civilized universe, with the possible exception of 17th century England. He was very attached to place, and this manifested in a deep interest in antiquity and in the history of places he visited. One of the reasons he hated NYC was he could look around him, see the architecture and th ink back to the past. The people around him were not living in that past, but in the presen t, carrying out mundane activities like trade and commerce, and he regarded them as a plague, not at all part of the universe in which the architecture, reflected great ae sthetic principles. The present, and the narrowness of most people's focus, he saw as a decline from some past age of greatness. Place-fixation shows up in his stories in the fact that nearly all of his horror is sited in New England, or more rarely, in plac es he visited elsewhere. If you read these stories, and go to these areas, you will very often find the exact sp ot he describes. Sometimes he gives them another name. To give a few quick examples: if you follow the directions in \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", there is indeed a bus line of the kind he describes; and if you follow the itinerary in that story, you find that the Dagon Hall is actually a hall belonging the American Veterans of Foreign Wars. The story \"Herbert West: Reanimator\" takes pla ce in the town of Bolton -- but the area he describes is actually in Clinton, the next town over. I know it well, because I live in Bolton, and I have seen the very neighborhood where the notorious Dr. West supposedly made off with the corpses of mill workers for his experime nts. There's a dam and a textile mill there. I know that a train line once ran through this area. It's now gone. The only thing that I can conclude is that Lovecraft must have at some have point passed through the region on that train line. Another example is \"Pickman's Model\". The ghouls that Pickman portrayed were found in certain tunnels under Boston. Those tunnels ex isted. They were smugglers' tunnels dating from colonial days that were unearthed duri ng subway construction at the time Lovecraft was writing. He apparently read about them, and decided to incorpor ate this detail. Perhaps he found a ghoulish amusement in the fact that th ese smuggler's tunnels linked some of the colonial mansions in the vicinity, an d ran alongside an old burying ground. Lovecraft's social alienation was profound. This shows in his tales as a complete lack of regard for what people expect in a story. There are never any romantic interests in his tales; he's writing philosophy. This is one thing that has kept his writing out of the mainstream. Literary people who think of the ordinary de tails of human life -- ma rriage, birth, death, the prom, what have you -- as the stuff of which gr eat literature is made , can't understand why anyone would read H.P. Lovecraft. This is ev en worse than the hardware fixation of hard science fiction, and of course sc ience fiction is not accepted as pa rt of the literary mainstream either. There is also an element of temporal dislocati on in Lovecraft's stories. Lovecraft seemed to practice a life-long ECI working. He didn't like his surroundings. He regarded himself as a gentleman of the 1700s, a displaced Tory, a man of letters from another time. He envisioned"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"himself wearing a powdered wig, and cultivated mannerisms and interests that we would regard as affectations. As an escape mechan ism this may have served his purposes, but it interfered with his capacity to deal with the present. There are copies of some of the few letters he wrote when he was attempting to look for work -- surely any of the newspaper editors or publishers who saw these letters must have shaken their head in disbelief. Yet he pursued this fantasy. What is curious is that he got other writ ers to play along with this, in terms of his personal correspondence. He gained contacts within the amateur press associations, and people there c ould see beyond the superficial asp ect of his life and enjoy the vividness of his imagination. This was what th ey saw as the real H. P. Lovecraft. These subjective features translate into things like the documentary style of his work, the first person narrative -- a disproportiona te number of his stories are in the first person. Again it is Lovecraft himself who is mirrore d in this: he is describing an image of his own realization that everyone around him was asleep, wrapped in comforting fantasies, and he himself possessed piercing insight into the true nature of things. He, as the narrator of such stories, suffered the blinding revelation of the true nature of the cosm os and the disintegration of conventional sanity as a result of this delving into the unknow n. But he never portrayed such narrators as deluded or damned. They were always people who, by th eir drive to know the truth, encountered the Othe rness of the universe. Many people have complained that Lovecraft overu ses adjectives. I call this the Eldritch and Blasphemous factor. Some critics conclude that he couldn't actually describe the monster, so he copped out by writing that it was eldritch and blasphemous and loathsome and horrible. Now if you look at his stories -- the precision of his descriptions, the care in constructing moods, the clarity and detail of travel reports in his letters -- it's certa in that Lovecraft is perfectly capable of describing intricate detail. If a particularly entity was a twenty-foot bloodsucking and bristling tick, he could describe it in exhaustiv e clinical detail. But that would miss the point! The point about the stories is that what makes these beings eldritch and blasphemous is not any feature of their physical form, but that by their very existence they strike at human faith in the cosmos. Their very existence defies, destr oys, and shatters the sense of certainty people have about what is out there. Lovecraftian tales are not ooga- booga monster stories. They are meant to disquiet the reader with the implicati ons, not with the forms of these entities. What he's trying to get at is indeed supernatural horror, even though he did not believe in the supernatural. Turning to the question of why this is relevant to occultists ... people make wild claims about H.P. Lovecraft. Some say that he was a medi um for the True Gods, the forces from Beyond -- that these fictional entities actually exist, a nd he was channeling them. Others claim that he was indeed initiated into occult s ecrets; but at the moment of pa ssing the portal of initiation he was eaten by the Dweller on the Threshold, a nd so could not accept the reality of these strange creatures, yet was compelled to write of them. But what actually makes Lovecraft important is this: although he did not regard himself as a magician, he took the best sources that he had available about the deep structure of the human psyche -- he took religious myth, not just in his childhood but later on, in seeking ideas and themes of his stories. He r easoned that the best thing to do was to go into comparative"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"religion, into folklore, and into the occult litera ture available to him and comb those sources looking for concepts that could be distilled down into notions that were unfamiliar, and yet all too familiar. He sought the raw archet ypal essence behind various symbols. So for example, there is Nyarlathotep, the cryptic messenger of the gods. This being is a sardonic trickster who conveys pow er and knowledge. It is clear th at what Lovecraft has taken the traditions surrounding Herm es, Mercury, and Thoth -- a bei ng who is the messenger of the gods and a bringer of knowledge, but also a trickster and a thief. People react to the original concept instead of the prettifie d, sanitized images of these myths that evolves as people tame the archetypes, to make their images comforta ble and familiar. (Think of the Mercurial logo used by florists!) Lovecraft carried out this distil lation for a number of figures and themes in his pantheon. He went to many sources, never taking anything at face value, never believing anything he read, never regarding it as more than an indicator of the nature of the human mind, a source of information he could exploit in rendering his tales more powerful and effective. This give his stories a power of evocation: they call forth in the reader that level of consciousness, that archetypica l entity, which he has portray ed through distillation of the essence of that figure out of other sources. This shows up in his focus on dream lore. He used dreams as a source of information, and was aware of the role of dreams in human dealings with the supernatural. Dreamlike states of consciousness play a prominent part in some of his stories. It also shows up in his treatment of atavisms. He re the fascination and the horror resides in the fact that he is seeking to evoke in the reader those early laye rs of the psyche. When you talk to a human being, you are also talking to a ma mmal, a reptile, a fish-frog -- these layers beneath the point of the awakeni ng of human self-awareness still exist, and still dictate much of human behavior. What is horri ble and fascinating about such things is the vague, disturbed realization in the reader that ye s -- part of him is a fish-frog, but he doesn't want to talk about that. That's ucky. That's terrible. Setians try to ra ise these principles to their ultimate potential (the deification of the bestial) as part of our idea of xeper, of becoming, but for most people these are hideous ancestral secrets they would ra ther not deal with. Lovecraft enjoys working with this dread. Finally, there is the Starry Wisdom elemen t of his tales. Lovecraft's understanding of astronomy and the sciences is incorporated to em phasize that the actual st ructure of reality is so fantastic, there is no reason to rely on old fables and old tale s to reveal the strangeness and otherness of things. Anyone w ho actually looked into it would find the cosmos unimaginably vast and alien. Lovecraft certainly portrayed this as an element of horror. Setians experience almost an exaltation in consider ing this -- to us the dimensions of Yog-Sothoth and the revels of Shub-Niggurath, these are not thin gs of fear and dread, they are us! -- this is the field of our play. But to the readership Lovecraft was ai ming at, they were concepts of repugnance. Now I don't have time to get into any depth on how the realm of art was inspired by what Lovecraft did. It is a sign of the power of these images, pe rhaps, that straightaway his correspondents wanted to write stories within his fictional world. He had a real impact on science fiction and horror, part ly through readers, partly thro ugh correspondence with those who went on themselves to become noted writers of fantastic literature."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"There are comic strip versions of some of Lov ecraft's stories, and H.R. Giger has of course reveled in the visual symbolism of Lovecraft. I won't get into the movies influenced by Lovecraft, which range from bad portrayals of actu al stories to simple allusions ... even a role- playing game has been created based on Lovecraf t's work. Some modern musicians have also immortalized his creatures in their work. Getting back, briefly, to the magical subculture -- as I said, there has been a lot of misinterpretation as to what Lovecraft is abou t. What we find interesting about Lovecraft is his ability to extract and draw forth these archet ypes, these features of the psyche, that people do not ordinarily speak of, are not conscious of -- and to project these in a way that is compelling. And Lovecraft did this so well that th e stories themselves ha ve strange effects. My favorite example of this is the Necronom icon. This was an imaginary book, based on both the actual existence of mysterious grimoires a nd forbidden books (some word of such things had reached the West) and on other fictional magical and \"channeled\" spiritual books that were known at the time. He did such a good j ob with it -- although the book didn't exist, he frequently quoted the most tantalizing fragment s from it -- that it almost immediately began trying to precipitate out of the subjective universe in to the objective realm. The first sighting was in the late 1930s. An index card for the book appeared in the Yale library card catalogue. Over th e next couple of decades, ther e were more card catalogue entries, and sightings in book lists publishe d by various reputable antiquarian booksellers (particular editions were listed for large amount s of money). Of course, the people who were doing this were hoaxing, but it was so plausible, so evocative, that people had no trouble believing that such a thing might be so. In th e end, it was so compelling that people decided they had to make money on it, and so pse udo-Necronomicons were published. You can go to New York City and buy a Necronom icon accessory spell kit. Lovecraft would surely be amused to hear that it has gotten to this stage. Yet he managed to evoke this book into existence. Was this Lesser Black Magic, that his grasp of what humans found mysterious and inspiring wa s so good that he was able to trigger this in other people? Was it a kind of poorly-understood Greater Blac k Magic on his part, that he changed the future long after his death, causing these things to come into existence? It's not too clear what is going on here, but what is si gnificant is that he reached into the psyche through various sources -- as I said, he took none of it at f ace value -- but he used these sources, extracted what would serve his purpose, and created somethi ng of such intensity, we can fairly say that he performed magic through his art. I think that this is really the legacy that Lovecraft gives us. By studying themes that he brings forth in his writing, as well as the manner in which he did it, and the connection to his subjective world revealed in his letters, we can learn something about the human mind and the realms of the imagination that can be tapped and developed into something truly magical in manifestation.

I am called Shehbui, my name being that of the god, South Wind. The great river which gives lif e to Egypt flows in the same direction as Shehbui. My land is but an arid desert ehich extends t housands of quare miles, and we have almost nowhere to live save this thin strip of green land watered by the Nile. He re in this region of Lower Egypt called the Delta, you will find the gr eat river branching off into a triangular network of tributaries, and here, nearly 150 m iles wide in some places, are fertile fields, luscious orchards, and abundant vineyards. Yet the desert, the threatening, inhospitable plac e for burial, the home of the dead, looms at the very fringes of our villages. But I will not sp eak now of the desert, for it is the river which has structured our lives and determined our economic and political framework. The Nile flows for more than 4,000 miles, creating along its length a pr osperous oasis. Ah! But my land, my Kem which you have come to learn ab out, stretches for only 750 miles between the mighty First Cataract at Aswan and ther Great Green (what y ou call the Mediterranean Sea). And, my friends, Kem is called \"the gift of the river\". Each year the Ethiopian rains flow in a deluge, pushing swiftly northward across the land, and only the towns remain above the water. Thus, every summer, the land is irriga ted; hopefully not too well, for flooding creates havoc - nor too low, for famine can easily inva de us if the life-giving waters do not reach deeply into the farm lands. Our three seasons are determined by the gods - and by the Nile's temperament! June through September marks the time of \"Inundation\", \"Emerg ence\" (of the land from the waters) occurs from October to February, and finally \"Dr ought\" lasts until June, beginning the cycle over again. The laborer's tasks are also patterned by the seasonal changes. Planting takes place during the Emergence, followed by harvesting and the preparation for the next planting during the Drought. While the land is completely fl ooded, pharaoh's innumerable and monumental projects are seen to! Yes, I must tell you, temple building is ceaseless! But let me continue. Though commerce and trade between our cities and towns (and othe r nations as well) affords a sound economic structure and a high degree of literacy among a large percentage of the people, it is my feeling that Egypt will be remembered by its ar t. Civilizations of the future will marvel at our mighty monuments and tr emendous works of our gifted artisans. My people are truly a joyful and intelligent r ace, loving life and living it to the fullest - extending it into the afte rlife with the same e xuberance and quality of enjoyment - from the lowliest peasant to pharaoh and his court. Prep aration for one's death and memorial services afterward are both elaborate and artistic, based somewhat on one's financial lot in life. The pauper wrapped in course clot h and buried unceremoniously in a communal grave has still prepared, though meagerly, for his journey in the afterlife. And, my friends, the most important point of all, is the near fanatical desire of each Egyptian to be buried in his homeland. For who will see to his needs? When he dies, who among the heathens beyond out borders would see to his proper burial? No, an Egyptian must be buried in Egypt, for only then will his mortal remains be preserved properly for eternity. I, honored guests, have been gifted by the gods. My talent and occupation is that of artisan; my primary responsibility lies in the creation of scenic painti ngs and adding lifelike pigments"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"to the work of sculptors. I have painted temple s and private dwellings alike, depicting scenes of everyday life and the activities of the gods as well. My work is fashioned to survive millenia, for as Atum has said, \"Thou are destined for millions and millions of years, a lifetime of millions.\" The spirits of my people will live forever, and as I have told you previously, it is in the works of myselves and those like me that this great empire will be remembered in future aeons. But! Enough of my own occupation, for I would not wish to appear a braggart. Let me touch upon some of th e different aspects of Egyptian life that I have knowledge of, and afterward you may all draw your own conclusions as to why we live as we do. As you probably know, pharaoh is at the topmost part of the pyramid of social structure. In order to create and maintain unification of a land as vast as ours, he holds total civil, military, and religious authority. Since he is the embodime nt of the gods, and therefore divine, he is responsible for the behavior of th e Nile, the success or failure of the crops, the fortune of the military and its endeavours - yes, all aspects of our lives. He owns all the land! He directs the entire labor force! His law is the only law! Those officials who assist Pharaoh have no authority other than his; they are merely his voice in all matters. Directly beneath pharaoh, the one we name \"ove rseer of all the works of the king\" is our mighty vizier. He can be directly appointed th e position by being noticed as an able and qualified member of some noble family. He doles out the pharaoh's justice, supervising public activities and occupations, and oftentimes is the leader of military expeditions. Among his many titles are \"seal-bearer of the king\", and \"sole companion of the king\". His list of duties and responsibil ities is too numerous to recall. He oversees the farmlands and orchards, the vineyards and wine makers, the w ildlife and domestic animals, the granaries, and the royal residence. The list is truly endless, my friends. He supervises every divine craft and construction. He is the cour t, the tax collector, and the tribute taker. He acts as our minister of war and chief of police. He is actually required to stand outside pharaoh's door each morning, and at his awakening, tend to hi s every need while reporting on the previous day's activities, and then receiving instructions for the next day. The vizier will then meet his own subordinates, examining and acting upon writte n and verbal reports from them.I truly do not know how he finds enough time in the day to accomplish all that he must! It is sometimes possible for a lesser-born pers on to aquire this hi gh rank, for as one great pharaoh wrote, \"Do not distingu ish the son of a noble man from a poor man, but take to thyself a man because of the work of his ha nds.\" I assure you, my friends, I would much prefer to remain in my position, than to assume the role of th e powerful, but harried, vizier! end part one (1) Footnotes 1 Ed.

Thousands of years have pa ssed since the first Temple of Set went into the mists of obscurity for its survival. Our magical and philos ophical heritages are therefore rich and multifaceted as a result of those ages gone before us, and to them we owe credit for the upstanding and honorable beings we are. Let us examine some of our forerunners and the shadow of the Temple yet to come within them and their degree and grade systems. In comparatively recent times, 1887 saw Dr. Willi am Wescott find a manuscript in cypher and discover it to purport to be sketches of mysti cal/pseudo-Masonic rituals. In the present day this manuscript is suspect and the indications ar e that it probably was forged -- certainly Dr. Wescott's correspondence with the manuscript's author, Fräulein Springel, is even more highly suspect. A well-written account of th e finding of the manuscript can be found in Howe's Magicians of the Golden Dawn , and we shall not concern ourselves overly with that account now. What we will be looking at are those foreshadowings of the Temple of Set. It is often difficult to untangle fact s and motives as time progresses for the most noble of organizations will be comprised of people, ther eby making them open to the chances of a bad seed rising.

Astris (7)=[4] Vincit Omnia Veritas (7)=[4] It is worth noting that, forged or not, the Go lden Dawn Charter has set the stage for new Words to come. Surely this notion to \"Initiate and Perfect\" was hardly a new one, but it was a public one. Further, it was one which as direct ion used means other than abasement. To \"Initiate\" was to take a member through steps of learning and expansion. To \"Perfect\" was to bring into power those qualities of excellence, thereby sending oneself up the scale/grades to the divine. \"To Initiate and Perfect any pers on\" approved was a high and lofty aim; surely they never expected the rise of devouring id-monsters, just as we of the Temple never really expect them, either. Yet id-monsters were, are, and ever shall be in one form or another. Indeed, with no stress there would be no re al gain and no actual glory. Regardless, the groundwork was laid and the Golden Dawn was open to lay down further guidelines for the yet-to-come Æons and Ages. In order to bring about that Initiation a nd Perfection, the Golden Dawn instituted a degree/grade system designed to allow the initia te to have exposure to and gain mastery of each stage. As a second function, the degree/grade system also allowed the officials of the Golden Dawn exposure to the aspiring initia te. Sound familiar? It should: it has been practiced by the O.T.O., the Church of Satan, and now the Temple of Set. While one of the best systems around, it nonetheless had its draw backs -- again, id-monsters can crop up in places one least expects them and lead to the occasional treachery. Yet it remains in effect perhaps because it says those on the way to Initiation and Perfection are worthy of trust . The ceremony of the Neophyte (0)=[0] was an impre ssive one for the new initiate. Briefly, the principle of Limitless Light, the ultimate pur ity and knowledge, was invoked to lead and guide the (0)=[0]. Importantly, the ceremony stru ck a note deep within the initiate and gave him a taste of magic to come. Just as importantly , it promoted in the initiate an interest and skill in acquiring the basics of magical savoir-faire . Compare it with our own First Degree initiate's course. There may not be a specifi c ceremony written for the First Degree, but many a new Setian attending his firs t group ritual will experience an inner \"tug\" or similarly described sensation. In short, he will have tasted magic and its effect. He will further, in all probability, want more. At the same time as the First Degree is exposing himself to the many areas open to new initiates of the temple, the opportunity is there for those of higher degrees to evaluate him. He may decide in this time of the White Star if this thing called the Temple of Set is right for him -- while the Temple make s a decision if he is right for it. Differ though they may, the foundations of the First Degree program was laid. The (1)=[10] of the Golden Dawn was known as the Zelator. It was followed by the (2)=[9] Theoricus, the (3)=[8] Practicus, and the (4)=[7] Philosophus. Grades (1)=[10] through (4)=[7] were concerned primarily with \"an understanding and mastery of the \"elemental\" forces governing the physical plane.\" (2) Again, all this -- plus so me! -- is more clearly and more accurately covered in the searches of th e First Degree Setian. [\"More clearly and more"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"accurately\" is defined as dealing with having a great deal of obscure nonsense previously dumped overboard.] After attaining (0)=[0] through (4)=[7], the Go lden Dawn initiate could then expect to advance to what was known as the Second Order. This comprised the grades of (5)=[6], the Adeptus Minor the (6)=[5], the Adeptus Major; and the (7)=[4], the Adeptus Exemptus. These Adeptus grades were designed to hold those w ho have attained magical proficiencies of high levels. Through various testings of the initia te's knowledge and expertise, he was judged Adept at dealing with the forces of nature. Co mpare now the Second Degree of the Temple of Set. The Adept II° [one degree rather than three divisions of a Grade] has been recognized as a master of magic, both Black and White. The chief distinction between him and the Third Degree is the fact that he has not felt the need to probe further into the workings and care of the Temple. He has not, as one Fourth Degree th inks of it, pestered Set until that worthy Prince has decided to give him more than he bargained for -- and then to spare! The Second Degree of the Temple of Set is unique, as are all Setian Degrees, but the Adept is in a position to thoroughly enjoy the benefits of his efforts wi thout the sometimes pleasurable and sometimes annoying duties of the Priesthood. it was certainly a differing situation for the (5)=[6], (6)=[5], and (7)=[4). These initiates had enormous amounts of garbage with which to deal. Yet note, their grade stood on the edge of then-known human development, just as the present Adepts have attained the greatest mastery possible for one to achieve without ordination by Set himself. The Golden Dawn initiatory scale went from Adeptus Exemptus (7)=[4] to the first step of the Third Order - the Magister Templi (8)=[3]. There was, in perspective, an enormous gap there. The Temple of Set and the Church of Satan befo re it rectified this by instituting a new degree, that of Priest III°. The Third Degree fills the needs of that prior gap quite well. It provides, among other things, for the orientation of the ne w Priest and allows hi m to strike out on a pace best suited for him into the world of ad ministration and guidance. It is a satisfying degree and has to be experienced in order to be truly appreciated. So did the Golden Dawn lay the way for the Third Degree? It would seem s o, if only by the absence of such a comparable grade in that initial organization. The Third Order, that of Magi ster Templi (8)=[3], Magus (9)=[2], and Ipsissimus (10)=[1] have little but mention in the Golden Daw n. From the Third Order proceeded the magical flow which guided the (0)=[0] through (7)=[4] to ward Initiation and Perfection. It was held that these (8)=[3] and above in itiates occupied places on the astral plane and lower degrees were advised not to hold their breaths until encountering them. [For organizational and administrative reasons, the three (7)=[4] initiate s, Wescott, Mathers, and Woodman, assumed the positions of Visible Secret Chiefs, operati ng for the Invisible Secret Chiefs, the (8)=[3] and higher.] Of the Third Order a ca. 1894 doc ument has this to say: The highest of all in this an cient scheme are the Great Rulers of the whole System, who severally sustain and govern th e Third Order, which includes Three Magic Titles of Honor and Supremacy. These represent the Supernal Tria d of the Sephiroth and are shrouded to the profane and to all other but the Chiefs of the Ad epts; in a case of a vacancy in this Order the Chief, most learned and most famous Adep t obtains by decree the well-earned reward. (3) "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"While this may have initially satisfied a need for the presence of the unapproachable, one is left to wonder how a vacancy could come a bout among exalted beings already occupying an exotic and esoteric plane. The implication is that ageing and death can extend even to the alien astral plane! It is possibl e this could be explained by the (10)=[1] being totally absorbed by the \"Limitless Light,\" or there may have been talk of there being grades existing beyond the (10)=[1], much like the ridiculous \"VII°+\" talk which we have heard in our own days. The Temple's own Magistri and above are very real and accessible ini tiates. Their hands may not always be acutely obvious to the First and Second Degree simply b ecause it is the duty of the Third Degree to provide that guidance. Yet again. the groundwork was placed: the (8)=[3] and above held knowledge and mastery over the Un iverse. That is more properly discussed in an arena such as the Sapphire Tablet of Set than here. However it may have ended, the Golden Dawn's goa ls were noble ones. It began with the idea of Initiation and Purification. It also began determined not to use its members: \"Those who could, paid their few shillings contri bution for stationery, re nt, and out-of-pocket expenses.\" That is one indicat ion that it was not organized to exploit people like some fraternal organizations that Symonds could name. It functioned somewhat on a humanitarian level -- though it could well be criticized fo r not demanding a decent fee or dues for its offices (4) The Ordo Templi Orientis, the well-known O.T.O., took magic a step further toward the Æon of Set when Aleister Crowley broke away from the dying Golden Dawn and became famous for, among other things, Uttering the Word , or Thelema, or Will, and thereby bringing about the Æon of HarWer. The Book of Coming Forth by Night contains references to and explanations of the Magus Alei ster Crowley so we need not go into a detailed account of him here. In forming what the Magus Crowley referred to as \"the structure and system of the Great White Brotherhood,\" (5) he divided his system into three orders and eleven grades, plus a designation of \"student,\" in whic h the aspirant was to gain a varied knowledge from a number of recommended volumes. [Compare his with our Reading List for the Temple of Set.] The Probationer (0)=[0] occupied the bottom of Magu s Crowley's first division, \"The Order of the Golden Dawn.\" This, along with the Neophyte (1 )=[10], the Zelator (2)=[9], the Practicus (3)=[8], and the Philosophus (4)=[7], is described in both The Degrees of Initiation in the Ruby Tablet of Set and in Magick in Theory and Practice . It can be seen that the Temple has condensed the (0)=[0] through (4)=[7] into a sing le First Degree, and on e that operates on a far more sophisticated level than the first A.A. division. Yet it is worth mention that this first division prepared the aspiring in itiate for the grade of Adept, just as our own First Degree recommendations are designed to bri ng about fully functioning Adepti. In the second division, \"The Order of the Ro sy Cross,\" there were three grades of Adept: Adeptus Minor (5)=[6], Adeptus Major (6)=[5], and Adeptus Exemptus (7)=[4]. From Magus Crowley's descriptions of the grades we can s ee that he saw in them powerful magicians, yet magicians without that extra something we know as Priesthood. The (7)=[4] does come close to the concept of an initial Priesthood, but as is characteristic of th e Magus of the Æon of HarWer, he made a leap across the vacancy to the realm of the Magistri, and thereby missed an excellent opportunity for the avoidance of a shock for his followers. The idea of a severe jolt resulting in damage and destruction proba bly would have received Magus Crowley's"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"complete approval. As one present day O.T.O. of ficial once pointed out, Aleister Crowley got rid of Magistri Templi as fast as they app eared. To him, a Master of the Temple was competition for control, and he wanted no threats to his supremacy. (6) It makes for an interesting train of thought wh en wondering how magic would be now if (a) an equivalent of the Third Degree had been instituted and (b) the Magus of that Æ on been less mindlessly destructive. However, that is purely academic at this point and has no place here. For a description of the (5)=[6], (6)=[5 ], and (7)=[4], refer again to Magick in Theory and Practice or to \"The Degrees of Initiati on.\" The likenesses are there. In the third division, \"The Order of the Silver Star,\" the Golden Dawn designations were kept: (8)=[3] Magister Templi, (9)=[2] Magus, and (1 0)=[1] Ipsissimus. The Magus Crowley's own instructions to the aspirants to the (8)=[3] were to annihilate the personality which, he said, \"limits and oppresses his true self.\" No advice could be more suicidal. The (8)=[3] advice was to obliterate that which make s man unique [his capacity for discernment, rational thought, judgement, etc.] in order that he might merg e with the universal awareness/consciousness. This, it will be noted, is patent hogwash. Nay, let us go a step further and define it as hogwash of a highly treacherous nature. The actual truth in the state of being of th e Magistri is one of being far apart from the universe. Magus Crowley's advice to his potential (8)=[3]s was therefore an invitation to magi cal death. It may have been easy, after a fashion, to allow oneself to be absorbed by nature and lose the sense of \"I\" but the catch was that no universal consciousness existed then or now. The actions a nd life of the originator of this piece of advice are notable in that they do the exact opposite of his teachings. The strong and vibrant personality of the being known as Aleister Crowley are marked. The (9)=[2] gets back a bit more on the right [l eft?] path. The Task of a Magus is to Utter a Word, a thing which will more than adequately describe magical progress to date, and will further give new direction to th e magical current of the time. Th e Word is marked as such by a number of characteristics: it will not be re cognized by some who will prefer to remain with an older and more comfortable Word; it will be marked by the teachings of the one who utters it; it will present a challenge to those hearing it; it will bring about positive and constructive changes in those who work with it; its impact will to some extent assume global proportions, and yet in all cases listeners mu st take care to ensure that the concept presented is actually a true Word. How does one do this? There is no enshrined way to do so. A Word should be tested in the initiate's personal life and judged from that standpoint. A true Word will further effect other myriad and unpredictable change s. The (9)=[2] of the Æon of HarWer was surrounded by a certain amount of the useless, though perhaps a certain amount of obscurity was desirable at the time. The Magus V° of th e Temple of Set will do his best to remove obscurities so that his Word can be made maximum use of. The (10)=[1] Ipsissimus of the th ird division is described in the way the (8)=[3] is advised to be: basically mindless. At the time, only Alei ster Crowley had claimed having attained the grade of Ipsissimus and again, his actions belie his claims. Whether he actually attained this exalted grade is a matter of some debate; at leas t, his actions were not in accord with his own descriptions of what an Ipsissimus (10)=[1] should be and do. The Temple of Set Ipsissimus VI° generally operates on the Fourth Degree le vel of Magister Templi except when acting in his special Sixth Degree capacity. A descripti on of the Sixth Degree is beyond the scope of this present paper. But let us say this: we re call our High Priest havi ng commented that if a Magus V° has vision in the land of the blind, th e Ipsissimus has perspective. The analogy is not an inaccurate one."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"The Church of Satan came forth on the world in the Year I of the Ag e of Satan, the year 1966 of the common era, and the world has never b een the same since. The Magus Anton LaVey Uttered the Word Indulgence and the Temple wa s almost upon us. Gone were the Circles and Squares and in their places came to be the I° through V° designations. The Church of Satan, like its High Priest a nd Magus, was flamboyant and devil-may-care [which he did], and its membership was as vari ed as could be imagined. Biographies of the Magus Anton LaVey exist in a number of forms, and will not be our concern here. Although they are informative reading, some are to be taken with 65 milligrams of sodium chloride while reading. The First Degree of the Church of Satan, the Apprentice, covere d a great number of people. It held both serious seekers and dilettantes, th e upright and the twiste d. A full screening of applicants was a practical impossibility, but it undeniably opened the door to variety with a vengeance. The Apprentice I° received an intr oductory packet, a meda llion, a subscription to the Cloven Hoof , a few reading recommendations, and was left pretty much alone. What he did with all this was up to him. Now, we provi de a bit more guidance th an that, but does the similarity strike you? The Warlock or Witch II° successfully passed an examination and enjoyed a certain prestige previously unknown in occult circles. A member holding the Second Degree had been recognized by the Church of Satan as being hi ghly skilled in the th eory and practice of Satanism. [Does it sound familiar?] It also required no organizational duties for those not occupying the posts of Regional Agents. [Also familiar?] The new Third Degree level took into account that enormous gulf between Adepti and Magistri. Designed for that or no t, it well covered a major part of the problem. The Priest of Satan III° was not only highly prof icient in his magic, but he also taught and guided the First and Second Degree Satanists. The Priest of Sa tan began to emerge as not only a magician with considerable skill and flai r, but also showed himself to be an able administrator. His discernment was such that his Priesthood permitted unusually clear judgements on when and how to work and guide. [Familiar?] The high integrity of the Church of Satan was markedly instrumental in forming the no-nonsense intelligence which is the Setian III°. The realm of the Magistri became divided into three parts: Magister Caverni, Magister Templi, and Magister Magus, all with the IV° designation behind them. These are covered in the writings of Dr. Aquino, and w ill not be gone into here. It s hould be noted that the Fourth Degree of the Church of Satan encompassed extr emely high levels of skill in both magic and administration. The Magus V°, of which Anton LaVey was the sole holder, put down clear grounds for the Temple of Set V°. Just as the Setian V° reflect s the Will of Set, so the Satanist V° operated under the Will of that we knew as Satan. It wa s a degree which insisted on integrity and clarity, for its owner held the infernal Mandate. And too soon id-monsters, never quite dead, erupted and the shining splendor which was the Church of Satan shattered into fragments. Yet of evil comes a greater good; such was the case and from the ruins of the Church of Satan arose the gleaming towers of the Temple of Set. It was a curiously both long and shor t journey here, and we have liv ed not only to tell the tale but to enjoy and continue our fight.

AEONIC TOPICS True Will Working This ritual was designed to provi de initiates with a tool with which to seek greater clarity on and understanding of their inner destinies as i ndividual black magicians.

Felczak III° Date: September 28, XXVI HTML Revision: Oct 07, 1997 CE Subject:  Thelema  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"life, both magical and mundane. To know this purpose and focus one's thoughts, words, and deeds towards its accomplishment is to gain cont rol of one's life, with the calm sense of inner certainty, empowerment and ma stery that this implies. As night-side sorcerers who walk the left-ha nd path, we are united by certain common goals such as personal growth and self-empowerme nt (Xeper), pursuit of hidden knowledge and forbidden mysteries (Runa), obtaining for ourselves the satisfac tion of our desires (Indulgence), and ultimately, th e realization of a superhuman and god-like state of being (Xem). As that great Satanic philosopher Frie drich Nietzsche once said, \"Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superm an -- a rope over an abyss.\" For the black magician the attainment of superhuman kno wledge and power is but a beginning -- an initiation -- of yet another stag e in a never-ending process of growth, gratification, inquiry, and empowerment, or in other words, of Being in the fullest philosophical sense of the term. The Being of the black magician return s eternally, forever creating itself anew (Remanifestation). But what of the Word in the aeonic formula of which I have not yet spoken? Understood from a black magical perspective, Thelema, the magi cal will, is both the driving power behind our magic and the point of intersection of these abstract universal goa ls with their unique manifestation in each of us as individuals. On the left hand path it is the individual magician's own radical self-will that is th e final authority and source of values. To the \"not my will but Thine be done\" of the Magus of the old aeon, the black magician replies \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law\", and hi s or her own will be done above all! The Magus of the word Thelema said that the nature of the True Will is to Go. That is, the magical will is not exhausted by a single finite aim. Rather it is a conscious volitional process that continually posits new goals for itself. At the same time, nevertheless, will is experienced and manifested in that which it wills, in goals. When goals are diffuse and multitudinous and bear no relationship to one another, the w ill is fragmented and dispersed. There is no concentration of power. To be consciously awar e of and attuned with one's True Will means that all one's goals arrange themselves into a logical hierarchy, s upporting one another in service of one overriding purpose. This is the force of destiny, of self-made de stiny, against which nothing can stand. Just as Siegfried reforged the mighty sword Needful from its shattered fragments, so too the magician who discovers and manifests his or her True Will forges the ultimate magical weapon from out of their many and fragmented sub-personalities. \"So wi th thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.\" (AL 1:42-43) This achievement of self-unification has been s poken of in elder books of arcane lore as The Great Work, the creation of the Philosopher's St one and, in the symbolism of the old aeon, as the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Gu ardian Angel. This \"Angel\" is no angel of God in any theistic sense. Rather it is th e crystallization of the magician's own ultimate selfhood. In the language of the Book of Openi ng the Way, it is the Neter Xem whose Name is unknown. To seek to know one's True will requires time, effort, and much reflection and inner searching. Fortunately, there is no shortage of tools and techniques to help us in the process."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Divination and the interpretati on of our dreams provide a gateway for our inner selfhood to express itself in the language of symbols, awak ening the Intelligence of the Heart. On a more intellectual level there are numerous well-known methods of goal formulation and planning, values-clarification, and examination of our be liefs and assumptions about life and reality. Perhaps most important of all is the structured and disciplined keeping of a diary or journal, which enables us to begin to discern the fundame ntal pattern of our lif e as it develops through time. Ritual can also aid immensely in this journey within. The Grimoires of olden time, such as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage , often prescribed magical retreats or retirements as times of preparation for the mighty works of sorcery. These were times where the aspirant isolated himself from profane concerns and devoted hi mself exclusively to intense self-examination, contemplation, and freq uent and fervent ceremonial invocation of his higher genius. Following the guidelines set down by Abramelin, Aleister Crowley used as his specific invocation ritual an adapted form of a Helleni stic Graeco-Egyptian rite of exorcism. This beautiful but exceedingly complex ritual is preserved for us in the body of Crowley's work as \"Liber Samekh: Theurgia Goetia Summa (Congressus cum Daemone) sub figura DCCC.\" For today's working I have adapted a much simp ler rite, a Wiccan True Will Ritual originally published by Selena Fox in the Circle Network News several years ago. I have revised it into an overall Setian framework and incorporated elements drawn from ancient Chinese sorcery as well as the Typhonian tradition in Thelemic ma gic. The signs or gestures in the summoning of the elements are adapted from the Golden Dawn rubrics, and may be found in 9K, pp. 412- 413. Requirements for Performance: This ritual can be performed either by a group or by an individual performing the several parts and offices by him or herself. All that is requi red is an altar or cham ber with the standard implements and a single black candle for each participant. Small black votive candles in votive glass cups are ideal for this. Each par ticipant will individually consecrate their candle at the altar at the appointed time. The candles can then be taken home and used in private meditative and introspective work -- where the quest for one's True Will really begins in earnest.

"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Liber Al Vel Legis: The Book of the Law ~Analysis and Commentary~ Introduction: On March 18, 1904 CE Aleister Cr owley and his wife Rose visited the old Boulak Museum in Cairo. She drew his attention to the XXVI Dyna sty funerary stele of the Theban priest Ankh- f-n-Khonsu . Represented on this stele are two Egyp tian god-figures and a winged solar disc, which Crowley identified respec tively as Nuit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and Hadit. He thought Ra- Hoor-Khuit to be a form of Ho rus the Younger (the Egyptological term for the son of Osiris and Isis in the Osirian mythos) and thus the sym bol of an \"aeon of the son\" to follow those of the mother-goddess (Isis) and the father-god (Osiris). He also be lieved Hadit to be \"Heru-pa- kraath\" (Harpokrates), the infant form of Horus the Younger. He identified Nuit [correctly] as the Egyptian goddess of the sky. An examination of the hieroglyphs on the stele — called by Crowley the \"Stele of Revealing\" — indicates that it was not conceived or execute d according to the Osirian mythos [save that the dead priest is referred to as \"an Osiris,\" i.e.: a dead soul]. \"Ra- Hoor-Khuit\" is correctly translated to \"Ra-Harakte, Master of the Gods.\" This is a form of HarWer (Horus the Elder — the Great Horus of pre-Osirian legend), literally \"H orus of the Horizon\" in his solar aspect of Xepera . Ra-Harakte had been the judge of the dead in non-Osirian Egypt, and he was also cast as the champion of Set in the Osirian-mythos trial between Set and Horus the Younger. The curious term \"Hadit\" is simply the Islamic word for a divinely inspired utterance of any sort; hence it is not found on the XXVI Dynasty monum ent. The \"Hadit\" disc is hieroglyphically identified on the stele as \"Behdety\", a form of Horus the Elder worshipped at Behdet in the eastern Nile delta. Summarily th e Stele of Revealing is not ba sed upon the Osirian triad at all; its themes are those of a Theban Sun-cult based upon Horus the Elder and Ra-Harakte. This casts an entirely new light on the Book of the Law that Crowley transcribed on April 8- 10, 1904. He interpreted the chapters and vers es of this document according to his understanding of the figures on the Stele of Re vealing, and these interpretations have been published as The Law is for All (Ed. Regardie), Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law (Ed. Symonds & Grant), an d The Commentaries of AL (Ed. Motta). Crowley's account of the Cairo Working — th e transcription of the Book of the Law — is contained in The Equinox , The Confessions , and The Equinox of the Gods . The concepts introduced in the Book of Comi ng Forth by Night make possible an entirely new analysis of the Book of the Law . This should be understood neither as an aesthetic criticism of Crowley's comments nor as an attempted distortion of them. It is rather the result of the perceptual vantage point of the Æon of Se t as opposed to that of the Æon of Horus. The Classification: V2 - A15.61 - 1 Author: Michael A.

As an Ipsissimus I assert a trans-aeonic perspective, hence the right — and responsibility — to comment accordingly on the Book of the Law . The First Chapter 1. Had! The Manifestation of Nuit. This chapter is a verbaliza tion of the Nuit-Form as perc eived by Crowley. [Throughout this comment the term \"Form\" is used in the Pythagorean/Platonic sense as a first and/or comprehensive Universal principle.] As the E gyptian sky-goddess, Nuit was portrayed as the mother of Set, Horus the Elder, Ra, and Xepera . 2. The unveiling of the company of heaven. The Book of the Law constitutes an explanation of concepts derived from these five Forms. HarWer is completely manifest, as is necessa ry for the Equinox of the Æon of Horus. The Xeper -principle is partially revealed through passag es in the text deali ng with transformation and evolution. The Form of Set would remain unrecognized and enigmatic, its presence but not identity sensed, until the announcement of the Æon of Set on the North Solstice of X/1975. 3. Every man and every woman is a star. A star is a self-contained unit of matter, en ergy, and the process of conversion between the two. Once formed, a star is an island of ex istence unique unto itself amidst the Universe, interacting comparatively remotely with ot her celestial bodies a nd phenomena through radiation and gravitation. The constitution of each abnormally intelligence human being ( homo sapiens ) is similar; one's interactions with other people and with one's environment have the capacity to be dwarfed by the Self-contai ned consciousness of the non-natural intellect. Ultimately the Self-created perceptu al universe of the magician can surpass the stimuli and consequences of the objective, material one. 4. Every number is infinite ; there is no difference. This principle was later revealed as an importa nt key to #II-76 by the Book of Coming Forth by Night. Crowley's extensive essay on the subj ect in both 777 and his 1920 Comment is excellent and deserves a thoughtful reading. According to Pythagoras and his Egyptian initiatory sources, numbers are the \"building-bloc ks\" of existence: They are not Forms per se, but are rather the \"alphabet\" through which many Forms are made comprehensible."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"If Nuit is considered to be the expanse of the natural, material Universe, then the inclusion of this statement in this first chapter assumes a dditional significance. Numbers are infinite. For example, there can be countless manifestations of things which are vi ewed as quarters of wholes or as quartets of complete wholes. At th e same time the \"4-principle\" is rigid in itself and is thus a fixed component of the natural Universe. 5. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men! The \"warrior lord of Thebes\" is Amon (Amun/Amen), the patron warrior-god of Thebes ( Uast ), generally portrayed as a ram or as a man wearing a twin-plumed headdress. This statement suggests the forthcoming catalyst of the Age of Satan [or Set/HarWer], symbolized by the Ram of Mendes ( Ba-neb-Tettu ), as a transitional phase between the Æons of Horus and Set. Note the emphasis given to the term \"Children\", implying an elect body of initiates rather than the human species as a whole. 6. Be thou Hadit, my secret cen tre, my heart & my tongue! \"Hadit\" means \"inspired utterance.\" \"Had\" is also the \"secret center\" of the word \"Abrahadabra\", described by Crowley as the Magical Formula of th e Æon of Horus. The \"abra\" prefix & suffix each translate hieroglyphica lly as \"heart of Ra\" or \"purification of Ra,\" which would render the entire Fo rmula as an \"inspired utteran ce from the heart of Ra.\" 7. Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat. Harpokrates is Horus the Younger, the later Os irian corruption of the Great Horus (HarWer). Hence the authenticity of Aiwass as an objectiv e entity seems doubtful. More probably he is a subjective idealization of Crowley's own personality. The Book of the Law is most coherently viewed as an \"inspired utterance\" of the Forms identified in #I-1 and #I-2, not a statement by Aiwass on behalf of a corrupted god-Form. 8. The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs. Khabs is the hieroglyphic term for the gods of th e 36 Dekans [or for stellar gods in general]. Khu may be translated from the hieroglyphic in several ways. Crowley preferred \"spirit\". It may also mean \"fire\" or \"flame\". Corresponding translations would be: \"The stellar gods are conceived by one's spirit; they do not impart it. \" -or- \"The stellar gods are within the flame; they do not create it.\" If the \"s pirit\" or \"flame\" is presumed to be the Black Flame of primal separate intelligence identified in the Diabolicon , then the two translations are identical. The stellar gods [as opposed to thos e signified by other symbols] are identified as aspects or Forms of the Primal Form of separate intelligence. 9. Worship then the Khabs, and be hold my light shed over you. Attention is properly directed towards the st ellar god-Forms and what they symbolize. One personification of these Forms [according to th e imagery of the Age of Satan] may be found in the Diabolicon . Other, more complex in terpretations are now bei ng developed through the Orders of the Temple of Set."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"10. Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known. This affirms the principle of initiatory eli tism [as opposed to egalitarian mob-rule]. The recurrent tragedy of human politic al history is that, whenever th e elitist principle is abandoned de facto — whether or not it was previously admitted de jure — corruption and disintegration of the host culture invariably results. 11. These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools. This is a sharp and succinct statement concer ning the inauthenticity of the prior religious systems of the world. Crowley proceeded to disregard this ad monition, needlessly encumbering his speculations and calcul ations concerning the Book of the Law with irrelevant myth-material from Buddhism, Hindui sm, and Cabalism. If the results were so often confusing and inconclusive, the Beas t had no one to blame but himself. 12. Come forth, o children, under the st ars, & take your fill of love! Crowley interprets this straight forwardly as a statement that se xual or artistic love should be indulged openly and innocently, and that an empathy with Nuit will be one of the consequences. It may also be that one's vision, ma gical abilities, and emotional sensitivity will be heightened at night, when Solar light a nd radiation are at leas t partially shielded. 13. I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your joy. A straightforward sexual statement concealing a mo re subtle truth: The essence of the Black Flame, emitted from the stars, is captured and sustained in the persons of the Elect. The intelligence of the Flame, both chaotic (HarWer) and composed (Set), takes pleasure in the generation and preservation of similar qualities in the Elect. For their part, the Elect experience a unique exhilaration at night, es pecially when exposed to starlight. 14. Above, the gemmed azure is The naked splendour of Nuit She bends in ecstasy to kiss The secret ardours of Hadit. The winged globe, the starry blue, Are mine, O Ankh-f-n-Khonsu. Crowley's poetic rendering of th e juxtaposition of Nuit and \"Had it\" on the Stele of Revealing. His misidentification of Behdety is again appare nt, as the lover of Nuit was a god of the Earth, not [either] Horus. The name \"Ankh-f-n-Khonsu\" translates to \"[He whose] Life is in Khonsu.\" Khonsu or Khons was the Moon-god of Thebes, son of the fam ily triad Amon/Mut/Khons. By the time of the XXVI Dynasty, the priesthoods at Thebes a nd Memphis were among the few remaining non- Osirian centers of learning. By the time of the New Empire, Amon was usually combined with Ra as Amon-Ra, which explains the Solar disc and Ra-Harakte on the stele of a Theban priest. 15. Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince- priest the Beast; and in his woman called th e Scarlet Woman is a ll power given. They"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"shall gather my children into th eir fold: they shall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men. \"Infinite space\" characterizes Nuit. The initiatory role and authority of Crowley and his Scarlet Woman are herein defined. They are charged to bring the A :. A :. into existence and to promulgate its doctrines to soci ety in general. Both of these tasks they indeed undertook, and their successful accomplishment was a necessary precondition of the Age of Satan and Æon of Set. 16. For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secret flame, and to her the stooping starlight. Crowley interpreted this verse as a simple iden tification of the Beast and Scarlet Woman with \"Hadit\" and Nuit respectively. He furthe r hypothesized an analogy to the Yang/Yin interrelationship of Chinese cosmology. To me this latter interp retation seems more substantive, implying as it does that complement ary magical influences would be required for the Æon of Horus to exert its full influence. 17. But ye are not so chosen. Crowley excuses this particular comment as bei ng directed to \"the other worshippers of Nuit\" besides the Scarlet Woman and himself. I read it as establishing to all readers of the Book of the Law that there would be but one \"prince-priest the Beast.\" The path etic posturing of the many self-proclaimed \"reincarnations\" of Aleister Crowley speaks for itself. 18. Burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent! The Uraeus cobra, worn on the forehead, wa s the symbol of Egyptian kingship. More precisely, the Pharaoh's role wa s that of a Priest-King: a di vinely inspired and sanctioned guardian of the initiatory Elect of Egypt. Nuit announces Crowley's ascent to his station as Magus of the Æon. Once again the auth enticity of the Book of the Law is subtly evidenced, as the exclusive symbolism of the Uraeus is unmista kable. \"This is the Ur aeus which came forth from Set.\" — Utterance #683, Pyramid Texts . 19. O azure-lidded woman, bend upon them! Nuit is the \"azure-lidded woman.\" Considered together with vers e #I-18, this implies that the Priest-King powers and percepti ons of the Beast and Scarlet Woman will be more fully realized during the hours of darkness. Horus, how ever, is a deity of da ylight; consider the three 12-1 PM transmissions of the Book of the Law itself. 20. The key of the rituals is in the secret word which I have given unto him. Crowley believed this word to be \"Abrahad abra\", symbolizing the union of complementary concepts through ritual. He expl ored its construction via Caba listic numerological techniques, arriving at various numbers which he believed significant to the Æon of Horus. While the Hebrew Cabala possesses no obj ective validity, Crowley insisted — presumably as a consequence of his Golden Dawn traini ng — upon trying to use it as a device for systematizing his philosophy. His di aries reveal his exhaustive e fforts in this vein and the many pointless \"results\" he achieved."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Exactly how Crowley used \"Abrahadabra\" as a ritu al key is obscure. He did observe that it contains 11 letters, and that the (1)=[10], (2)=[9], (3)=[8], etc. grades of the G :. D :. and A :. A :. incorporated an elevenfold base [which was ra ther at odds with the tenfold Cabalistic Tree of Life]. He also felt the word to be a \"correct ed\" version of the older term \"abracadabra\" (a pyramidal word-puzzle based upon the a-b-c-d sequence). 21. With the God & the Adorer I am nothing: they do not see me. They are as upon the earth; I am Heaven, and there is no other God than me, and my lord Hadit. Crowley interpreted this passage as descriptive of the Stele of Revealing. I read it rather as a statement concerning the true natu re of \"God\", i.e.: the mechanical , inertial cosmos (objective universe) (Nuit) as opposed to popular concepts of God as an anthropomorphic, sentient center of willful personality. Such fantasies ar e unsubstantiated. The true \"God\" is \"Heaven\" (the objective universe/Nu it), and it is perceived as such by m eans of inspired visions (Hadit). 22. Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I will give to him when at last he kn oweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bi nd nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any ot her thing; for thereb y cometh hurt. The secret name, revealed in the 12th AEthyr of Liber 418 (The Vision and The Voice ), was that of Babylon or Babalon, incorporated by Crowley into the seal of the A :. A :. . Again Nuit is shown to comprise the objective universe. The adju ration of this passage lays bare the terrible secret of all forms of God/nature worship: the forcing of all deviant Will towards uniformity and conformity to the cosmic norm. Difference or independence of any sort — particularly intellectual separation — is anathema to Nuit. 23. But whoso availeth in this, let him be chief of all! A Magus — (9)=[2] A :. A :. , V° Church of Satan, or V° Temple of Set — is in fact an individual who succeeds in achieving a perspec tive of separation from the objective universe and, from that point of perspective, Uttering a Word [=formulating a philosophy] to alter that universe in some fashion. Nuit's reaction is one of inertia. The change is resisted, but once accomplished it is reinforced. Once a Magus has successfully completed his Task, he becomes obsolete as such and must either revert to the level of Magister Templi or take the oath of Ipsissimus. 24. I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty. 25. Divide, add, multiply, and understand. Crowley divided 6 by 50 and got 0.12, which he thought might signify his 0=2 equation. His other attempts to solve the mathematical riddles of these verses were unsuccessful, though he attributed one or two Cabalistic symbols to the numbers that resulted. He did not, however, uncover the word of Nuit. That word is \"inert ia\", whose letters, num bered per the English alphabet [cf. the Book of Coming Fo rth by Night]=76=13=4. 506=8. 50+6=56. 50x6=300. 8+56+300=364=13=4= key number concealing th e sacred decad of Pythagoreanism (1+2+3+4=10). Cf. also Crowle y's most significant Book 4 . Q.E.D."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"26. Then saith the prophet and slave of the be auteous one: Who am I, and what shall be the sign? So she answered him, bending down , a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black ea rth, & her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the unfragmentary non-atomic fact of my universality. The response to Crowley's appeal for confirmati on of his identity was this endorsement of his belief that he was in fact the Beast 666. The most subtle and meaningful of all signs was given — a reminder of Crowley's ability to sense the omnipresence and comprehensiveness of Nuit. Such an experience would have been impossi ble for one of lesser vision than a Magus, because a Magus, by definition, must first compre hend the totality of what presently exists before Uttering a Word to exert change upon it. 27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Qu een of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ev er thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of th ee at all, since thou art continuous! Crowley's ecstatic recognition of the sign, and ho pe that mankind generally will not transcend inertia by achieving a point of pe rspective similar to his [from which Nuit may be seen \"from outside\"]. Presumably this follows #I-5 and #I-1 0, in which only Elect initiates may presume to \"see the goddess unveiled.\" 28. None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two. Nuit validates the concept that she is all-incl usive, hence cannot be distinguished from any other thing known to her . [The Set/HarWer phenomena ar e distinct and apart from the objective universe.] Yet the objec tive universe is not a homogenous whole; it is everywhere separated into complementary parts: +/- ma gnetic fields, matter/antimatter, mass/energy, light/darkness, heat/cold, etc. It is the interaction of these parts which engenders the phenomena of time and mathematics. 29. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. Love is the highest expression of compleme ntary attraction. The di vision of Nuit into complementary components makes love possible, and the many possibilities for combination bring the phenomena of chance into play. 30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of divison is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. Division — the forced separation of a homogenous whole into parts — is disruptive, hence painful to the inertia of Nuit. Dissolu tion of components th rough their union with complements is joyful, insofar as the homoge nous whole is thus restored. The statement argues against division and for the reunion of the whole. Again this tendency of the Nuit- Form confirms its true identity as such. 31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feel little; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Crowley need not worry about obstructions to the unification of Nuit resulting from the emotional and intellectual spasms of uni nitiated mankind. These are balanced by complementary forces — joy for pain, satisfact ion for curiosity, the death-wish for the life- force, etc. Hence intellectual or emotional ventures will be neutralized before they stray so far from the pattern as to recognize it for what it is. And the initiates known to Nuit are only those who seek to hasten reunification of the whole. 32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all. Nuit admonishes Crowley not to stray from the goal of reunion. Dissolution of the self into Nuit brings an end to all self-consciousness and thus from pain. The ultimate argument of Nuit is for suicide of the finite self in order to become part of the infinite whole. [Cf. Crowley's discussion of the \"annihilation of the self\" via the \"crossing of the Abyss\" between Adeptus Exemptus (7)=[4] and Magister Templi (8)=[3] in One Star in Sight .] 33. Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the Queen of Heaven; Write unto us the ordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us the law! Crowley desires the means for reunion with the whole to be explained to him in terms of ordeals (stresses necessary to de stroy the self), rituals (mental and physical exercises to bring initiates closer to Nuit), and law (command ments that are to be obeyed to achieve the reunion). 34. But she said: the ordeals I write not: th e rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the Law is for all. Nuit refuses to identify the suicide \"ordeal\" required of separate personalities for absorption into the whole. The procedures for the rituals will be imparte d, but the weakening of the self resulting from those rituals will not be identified for what it actually is. The Law — that Nuit insists the reunion be pursued — is all-embracing; it is integral with the Form of Nuit in its entirety. 35. This that thou writest is the threefold book of Law. Identification of the name of the Book of the Law . 36. My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall no t in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra- Hoor-Khu-it. The Book of the Law is not to be altered, edited, or abridged in any way by Crowley, though he may comment upon it in order to explain its relevance to the Æon of Horus. The reason that the text may not be touc hed by that Magus is that it co ntains formulae recognizable only after the Æon of Horus, as is ev ident from this commentary and the contents of the Book of Coming Forth by Night. 37. Also the mantras and spells; the obeah a nd the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword; these he shall learn and teach."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Ceremonial and operative magical procedures are among the tools th at the Beast is to use for the communication of his Word. The suit of Wa nds in the Tarot covers aspects of positive existence; the suit of Swords covers aspects of force and destruction. The path of the Æon of Horus would seem evident, particularly agains t the tableaus set forth in the second and third chapters of the Book of the Law . 38. He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals. A Magus must Utter his Word; that is, he is co mpelled to explain his philosophical principle. Nevertheless he may choose those for whom he deems such explanation educational and beneficial. Pearls need not be cast before swine. 39. The word of the Law is Θελημα . [In English: Thelema .] Crowley explained this concept as \"harmony of Will and Action,\" but he also wondered if it might not also have \"probably a very lo fty secret interpretation.\" That interpretation is decipherable once the wo rd of Nuit — inertia — is known. What is understood by the term \"Will\" is an expression of mental separateness from Nuit, in that the self is impressing its desire for inertial cha nge upon Nuit. By defin ition, then, the separate Will cannot be harmonious. Harmony with Nuit can occur only when the separate Will is destroyed and the mind mechanically fused with the inertia of the objective universe. This notion has been expressed as \"oneness with G od,\" nirvana, etc. From the standpoint of Nuit this is immortalization of the Will; from the standpoint of the individual apart from Nuit it is suicide. Contained in the concept is the principle th at the individual Will can be weakened and destroyed only by the separate being possessing it . It is not \"of Nuit\" and cannot be directly influenced by that Form. Within the context of the Æon of Horus, then, Th elema could be seen as the \"sane\" alternative to chaotic behavior, since the essence and presence of Set were as yet concealed. 40. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the word. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, a nd the Lover, and the man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Crowley advanced a Cabalistic interpretation thus: The = the Hermit [of the Tarot] = \"invisible yet illuminating.\" le = the Lover = \"visible as is the lightning-flash — the College of Adepts.\" ma = \"the man of Earth — the Blaste d Tower.\" He went on to add the Cabalistic/numerological values of these thr ee cards and obtained 31 (\"AL\"+\"LA\"), whence came the secret name of the Book of the Law . The famous final sentence of this passage, originating [like \" Thelema \"] in Dr. Francois Rabelais' novel Gargantua , had also been used by Sir Francis Dashwood who inscribed Fay ce que Voudras over the main entrance to Medmenham Abbey. Crowley, in adopting it, applie d it specifically to \"one's true will\" — which, according to the Word of the Æon of Ho rus, meant the uniting of the individual Will with that of the objective universe (Nuit). 41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! re fuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can uni te the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed! Accursed! be it to the aeons. Hell."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Compare the Magical Formula of the Age of Satan (1966-1975 CE): \"Indulgence instead of Abstinence.\" Crowley interprets \"love\" in a sexual context, but the comment concerning union of the divided implies th e neutralization of complementary opposites by fusion — the compulsion of Nuit. [See #I-29 through #I-32.] All impulses other than those which lead towards such reunion and neutralization are s een as a curse, and they are collectively characterized as Hell. This is not inconsistent with the symbolism of the Diabolicon and the Age of Satan that succeeded the Æon of Horus. 42. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will. \"Hell\" is further described as \"that state of manyhood,\" i.e.: a va riety of distinct and separate Wills, which, from the standpoint of Nuit, is a condition \"bound and loathing.\" Compare again the Diabolicon . Again the charge is given that pola rized intellects \"have no right\" but to \"do thy Will\" — a meaningless aphorism except as interpreted per #I-39. 43. Do that, and no other shall say nay. The human intellectual separation from Nuit is the only such manifestation on Earth. Once this \"flaw\" has been \"corrected\", the natural in ertia of Earth will have been restored. There are no other intellects capable of ach ieving a sense of separateness — of \"saying nay,\" as it were. 44. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is in every way perfect. Will \"delivered from the lust of result\" and without \"purpose\" is independence of Will destroyed. The concept of Will then becomes co mpletely meaningless except as identified with the cosmic inertia as a whole. This would in fact be \"perfection\" from the standpoint of Nuit. 45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none! Perfection as defined by Nuit consists of un ity. Once it has been achieved, it becomes a meaningless concept, since there will be none apart from it to appreciate that unity. 46. Nothing is a secret key of th is law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen. In that fulfillment of the Law would reduce all intellectual existence to unity and thus to a meaningless concept, \"nothing\" is indeed a secret key to the Book of the Law ! What the Jews call it is unimportant, since the Hebraic/Cabalisti c numerological system is insubstantial. The sum of 8, 80, 400, and 18 is 506 = 11 = the el even-lettered formula of Abrahadabra. 47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear. Another reaffirmation of the law of Nuit. 48.

[Here it a ppears that \"fool\" is to be understood in the mundane sense rather than as synonym for the A :.

Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, al l words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be th e adorant, Isa the suffe rer; Hoor in his secret name and spendour is the Lord initiating. All principles of ceremonial magic not in accordance with the Book of the Law are obsolete and should now be discarded. Ra-Harakte \"hath ta ken his seat in the East:\" The Sun is now dawning on the Equinox of the Gods. Since the Vernal Equinox occurs at approximately March 21, it may be assumed that the statement refers to an \"equally-balanced night\" between the unity of Nuit and the separate chaos of HarW er [as will be seen in the third chapter]. Asar (Osiris) and Isa (Isis) are identified as representative of a non-germane principle: that of posthumous redemption and revival. Osiris is a mythical object of popular worship; Isis is symbolic of those who equate worship with abstinence, suffering, and deprivation. Death- worship [in the biological sense as distinct fr om the self-obliteration sense] and worship by abstinence have no place in the Æon of Horus; they would be distracting to the actual Word of the Æon. The secret name of Hoor (the hieroglyphic Hor or Horus) is HarWer — in hieroglyphics the \"Great Horus\" or Horus the Elder — not the Horus [the Younger] of the Osirian mythos. 50. There is a word to say about the Hierophant ic task. Behold! there are three ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest; thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not on e know well the other! Within the Æon of Horus the initiatory Order — the A :. A :. — may accept persons of various levels of intelligence for appropriate pursuits wi thin the Order. Tests and ordeals should be tailored to individuals' potenti al as appropriate. [Consider al so #I-3.] Nevertheless there should be no confusion or blurring of the distin ction between the severa l intellectual levels; intelligence is a dispassionate identification of elites. 51. There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silver and gold; lapis lazuli & jasper are there; and all rare scents; jasmine & rose, and the emblems of death. Let him enter in turn or at once the four gat es; let him stand on the floor of the palace. Will he not sink? Amn. Ho! warrior, if thy servant sink? But there are means and means. Be goodly therefore: dre ss ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! Also, take your fi ll and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will! But always unto me. Crowley considered this passage a more or less literal interpretation of the initiatory environment the A :. A :. was to use. Lapis lazuli and jasper he considered symbolic of Nuit and \"Hadit\" respectively, and he thought jasmine and rose to represent \"the two sacraments\""},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"(the male and female sexual fluids). He referre d guardedly to the \"emble ms of death\" as the ceremonial symbols of Freemasonry — to be adopted and used by the A :. A :. . If the passage is indeed descriptive of an initia tory temple, then it may be read literally and a temple constructed accordingly, complete with four gates and sinking floors [perhaps an alligator pit for the quick & tidy di sposal of would-be initiates w ho failed the tests of #I-50?]. 52. If this be not aright; if ye confound the sp ace-marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many; if the ritual be not ever unt o me: then expect the direful judgments of Ra Hoor Khuit. Crowley identified \"space-marks\" as stars [in the sense of #I-3]. It is equally erroneous, he said, to consider individuals as either completely interc onnected with or completely disconnected from one another. By \"the ritual\" he understood the sex-act, taking the admonition to mean that it was of value as a magical ritual more than as an expression of brutish lust. This is an important distinction in Crowley's own magical philoso phy and explains his interest in the later, sex-magic-based Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Crowley's magical and aesthetic approach to sex has not, it may be said, been carried forward in the practices of his latter-day disciples, mo st of whom err on either side of the delicate balance between the symbolic and the animalistic. 53. This shall regenerate the wo rld, the little world my si ster, my heart & my tongue, unto whom I send this kiss. Als o, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee. But ec stacy be thine and joy of earth: ever To me! To me! The impulse of Nuit is to restore natural harmony and balance to the Earth — a condition which is distorted by the non-natural intellect ual self-consciousness of mankind. Crowley's exalted role in this design shall not exempt him from self-obliteration as well, but he is promised \"ecstacy and joy\" — the first fr om intellectual union with the objective universe/Nuit and the second by re turn to the physica l station of a non-intellectual, natural animal on Earth. 54. Change not as much as the style of a le tter; for behold! thou, o prophet, shall not behold all these mysteries hidden therein. In fact the various printed ve rsions of the Book of the Law have consistently omitted key elements of the handwritten manuscript that co uld not be typeset. Two of these elements — the configuration of the coded passage #II-76 an d the grid/number matrix behind part of #III- 47 — proved crucial to their decipherment in the Book of Coming Forth by Night. 55. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them. Crowley interpreted this verse in a magical, rather than in a genealogical sense. At first he felt the \"child\" to be Charles S. Jones (Frater Ac had), but then abandoned this opinion when Jones developed theories not in accordance with Crowley's own beliefs concerning the Æon. The matter was unresolved at the time of Crowley' s death, nor were his various disciples or"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"organizational splinter-groups able to reach consensus upon it. The question was resolved by the Book of Coming Forth by Night precisely a century afte r Crowley's own birth. 56. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected house cometh that child. Aum! All word s are sacred and all prophets true; save only that they understand a little; solve the first half of th e equation, leave the second unattacked. But that hast all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark. The \"child\" would be neither of the \"Eastern \" (oriental/Theosophical) nor of the \"Western\" (Cabalistic/Masonic) magical sc hools, but would come rather from a school distinct from and unrecognized by both — the Church of Satan, an in itiatory magical Order that itself rejected the doctrines both of the aforementioned sy stems and of Crowley's organizations. The \"child\", as Magus of the Æon of Set, necessarily had to reject the premises of the Æon of Horus as obsolete and/or incomplete, but this same perspective and initiatory comprehension enabled him to explain key mysteries of the Æ on of Horus that had been unresolved even by Crowley himself. By definition only a Magus may completely comprehend a previous Magus — because the successor possesses the extra-aeonic perspective required. Crowley's curiosity concerning the identity of the \"child\" is also dismissed as futile — a word of advice which he, to his continuing frustration, refused to heed. The Words of the several Magi are valid under the circumstances of their Utterance, but each Magus will Understand only those magical and ph ilosophical principles encompassed by his Word [and previous Words to the extent that it elaborates upon them]. Each Word represents a new equation between the experience of the pa st and the problems of the future. A Magus may use the power of his Word to better understa nd the past and to address the present, but he should not presume that his Word will be the final solution to the indefinite future. The intellect alone will enable man to confront problems purely in the realm of the objective universe, but the uninitiated intellect is inad equate where the entire Universe — including metaphysical realities — is concerned. This is the realm of the Magi. 57. Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is th e dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowin g the law of the fortress, and the great mystery of the House of God. All these old le tters of my Book are aright; but Tzaddi is not the Star. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise. Nuit is to be invoked during the hours of darkness. \"Love is the law, love under wi ll\" became one of Crowley's key aphorisms [generally used to close any document opened with the \"Do what thou wilt\" quote from #I-40]. He understood it to mean a profound empathy with all entities of creation, guided not by fear [which he considered the Christian motive for love] but by deliberation. There is further a caution concerning superficial types of love. There is \"pure\" love for its own sake — the dove; and there is love for ulterior motives — the serpent. [Crowley interpreted the serpent as a sy mbol of Kundalini, a sex-magic force supposedly coiled at the base of the spine. I find the concept quai nt, if hardly to be taken seriously.]"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Crowley himself chose the love of the serp ent, always subordinating human love and affection to his magical Workings . As a result his love-life cons isted of an endless string of disasters, his opinion of women remained imma ture, and his experiments with sex-magic [as highlighted, for example, in The King on the Royal Art , one of his sex-magic diaries] were pathetic and fruitless. The \"great mystery,\" which Crowley declined to explain in his commen ts on the grounds that it was reserved to the highest grades of initiation, was simply that he believed sex-magic to be the most potent form of the art — explained on ly at the highest degrees of the O.T.O. Crowley understood \"Book\" as the Tarot, and the Hebrew letter Tzaddi as the Emperor trump in that deck. In his commentary he proceeded to explain why this passage identified this trump as complementary to the Star trump XV II — which I simply do not see implied by the above passage of the Book of the Law . [Crowley devised a Hebrew /Cabalistic interpretation for the Tarot, which I consider useless.]. 58. I give unimaginable joys on earth: certai nty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstacy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice. The promise of Nuit to mankind upon its re-i ntegration with the objective universe — at which point there would be not hing left to sacrifice, nor any separate mind feeling any awareness of a separate \"deity\" — hen ce not even the notion of \"sacrifice\". 59. My incense is of resinous wood & gums; and there is no blood therein: because of my hair the trees of Eternity. The composition of incense for Nuit and the reas on for it — the tree as a symbol of timeless existence because of its apparent lack of change , i.e.: growth at a comparatively slow rate. 60. My number is 11, as are all their numbers wh o are of us. The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to th e blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me. See #I-24; 5+6=11. See also the comment con cerning #I-20. The five-pointed star is the Pentagram of Set, and a red circle is the E gyptian symbol for the Sun. This fragment is inconclusive, but it might suggest the encircle d Sigil of Baphomet [used during the Age of Satan] with its Solar connotati ons of virility — a glimpse of Things to Come. To non-initiates the esoteric nature of the Book of the Law might seem \"black\" (i.e.: Sa tanic), but in fact it is \"blue & gold\" (a \"God\"-oriented initiato ry system of magical philosophy). For the \"secret glory\" see again #I-30. 61.

I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night sky. 65. To me! To me! 66. The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end. The Second Chapter 1. Nu! the hiding of Hadit. According to Islam, the term Hadith identifies a \"divinely inspired utterance.\" The term has no meaning in Egyptian hieroglyphic. The \"H adit\"-figure on the Stel e of Revealing is identified in the inscription as Behdety, a fo rm of HarWer, the Great Horus. This Second Chapter is intelligible if it is understood as an utterance of Aleister Crowley inspired by HarWer. [By contrast, the Third Chapter is in the form of a direct address by this neter .] In this first verse Nuit is said to conceal or obscure the magician's awareness of HarWer. If Nuit is recognized as the inertial neter of the objective universe, and if HarWer — per the Book of Coming Forth by Night — is seen as a concentration of intelligence directly opposite to Nuit, the antipodal tension be tween them may be understood. 2. Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I, Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extende d, and Khabs is the name of my house. Crowley considered Hadit to be symbolic of \"infinite contraction\" — a geometric point — and Nuit \"infinite expansion\" into the three geometric dimensions. The concepts have no meaning save in pure mathematics, because the former state would mean nonexistence save as a locus, and the latter a stat e of existence embracing everything — in which case \"Hadit\" could not think or talk, while there would be no one \"else\" for Nuit to talk with! \"Khabs\" may be translated in many ways [see #I-8]. Here it may characterize HarWer as a neter of \"pure spirit\" [see #II-1]. 3. In the sphere I am everywhere, the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Crowley compared this to \"an old mystical definition of God — He whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere.\" In terms of Euclidian geometry, of course, both the center and the shell of a given sphere can be determined. Techni cally the shell can be \"found\"; it is the physical displacement of a sphe re in space. But the center has no three- dimensional existence; it has location only. #II-3 is thus contradictory to fact. This statement would place HarWer completely outside of the ob jective universe [where such laws apply]. 4. Yet she shall be known and I never. The objective universe may be comprehended thr ough the logical and empirical procedures of science. The pure intellect, since it possesses the capacity to behave illogically, may not be defined through logic alone. Noetic intuition is also required. C onsider here the Dialogues of Plato relative to the actual identification and definition of a Form/ neter . 5. Behold! the rituals of the old time are blac k. Let the evil ones be cast away; let the good ones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go aright. Crowley understood the \"old time\" as a referenc e to the Æon of Osiris , characterized by the predominance of death-worship religions, now to be superseded by the Æon of Horus. He understood the ritual reference to mean that he must purge the texts of the Golden Dawn (G :. D :. ) to ensure their compliance with the principles of the new aeon. 6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is th e knowledge of me the knowledge of death. The capacity for intelligent though t distinguishes man from beast. This same capacity enables man to perceive his existence as distinct from th at of the Nuit-cosmos, hence the finity of that distinct existence — eventu al death of the self. 7. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. \"Come unto me\" is a foolis h word; for it is I that go. HarWer is the creator of a new aeon and the dest royer of the old one. His being is the origin — or axle — of the new aeon, and elaborations of the Word of that aeon extend outwards from this core principle. Cubical altars within magic circles were used for certain types of magical ceremonies, but the relationship was expanded to three dimensions in the \"Cry of the 30th AEthyr\" in Liber 418 (The Vision and The Voice ): \"This cube is surrounded by a sphere\" — implying the spiritual above and beyond the purely material. 8. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshi pped me; ill, for I am the worshipper. Harpokrates, the infant Horus the Younger of the Osirian mythos, is in fact a corruption of HarWer, the Great Horus. Here HarWer exposes the corruption and points to a further fallacy: An intellect cannot worship itself as an \"object\". 9. Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which remains."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"This reaffirms the opposition of HarWer to Nuit, who considers non -existence [of anything else] the supreme joy [see #I-32]. Finite inte llects are subject to death. The non-conscious whole of matter/energy (Nuit) will, however, continue to displace space indefinitely. 10. O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing. 11. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger. 12. Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not. 13. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me. Crowley recounts that, at this point, he re sented the direction of the Book of the Law but was unable to cease transcribing it. At the time he was an avowed Buddhist [which, since Buddhists seek obliteration of the self in nirvana , is not inconsistent with his attraction for Nuit]. The Second Chapter of the Book of the Law attacks this position with an affirmation of the independent existence of the intellect. And even the very attempt to \"deny\" the intellect necessitates its existence: Cogito Ergo Sum . 14. Now let there be a veiling of this shrine; now let the light devour men and eat them up with blindness! Despite the glaring truth of #II- 10/13, those who \"don't want to hear it\" will simply ignore it in favor of cherished fantasies. Crowley hims elf missed its significance altogether. Hence he also failed to understand that it was the HarW er aspect of his own mind that was the actual source of this Second Chapter. 15. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Wh ich is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for th ere is a further secret. In the Old Comment, which appeared in the Equinox in 1912, Crowley wrote: \"I am perfect, being Not (31 LA or 61 AIN)... Which is vital, fo r I am None indeed. LA.\" This is rather at odds with the notion that Char les Stansfeld Jones (Frater Ac had) first communicated the AL/LA \"key\" to Crowley in 1919. 9 is the number of the Tarot trump \"The Herm it,\" symbolizing [according to the Book of Thoth ] the Secret Fire Khu [see #I-8 and #I-13]. Within th e scope of the Æon of Horus, however, only an Ipsissimus (10)=[1] — a \"fool\" — could perceive this. To others an intellectual ev aluation of HarWer would yiel d 8 = \"Adjustment\". Among other things this trump signifies the displace ment of an obsolete aeon by a new one. Trump #1 — \"The Magus\" — refers to Crowley's role \"in 8\" — i.e.: in the new aeon as the instrument of Adjustment. This is \"vital\" insofar as the HarWer neter cannot manifest itself in the objective universe save through the mi nd of a material/intellectual medium. \"The Empress\" (trump #3) and \"The Emperor\" (trump #4) add to trump #7 (\"The Chariot\"), signifying the North Solstice and the mystery of the Grail. This is indeed a \"further secret,\" as"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"it is not of HarWer and would be reveal ed only in the Hall of the Dead ( Walhalla ) at Wewelsburg Castle, Westphalia, in XVII/1982 CE. 16. I am the Empress & the Hierophant. T hus eleven as my bride is eleven. \"The Empress\" (trump #3) and \"The Hierophant\" (trump #5) again equal \"Adjustment\" (trump #8). The Æon of Horus is characterized by the el even-lettered formula \"A brahadabra\" [see #I- 20]. 17. Hear me, ye people of sighing! The sorrows of pain and regret Are left to the dead and the dying, The folk that not know me as yet. 18. They are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor and sad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk. 19. Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the hi ghest are of us. They shall rejoice, our chosen, who sorroweth is not of us. 20. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, for and fire, are of us. The Law of Thelema is for those who have th e wit and the will to comprehend and apply it. All others are fated to continue their slow, inevitable regressi on to beasthood. [Consider H.G. Wells' Island of Dr. Moreau .] As for intellectuals and ma gicians of the obsolete aeon: \"Such a being is gradually disi ntegrated from lack of nourishm ent and the slow but certain attraction of the rest of the uni verse, despite his now desperate efforts to insulate and protect himself, and to aggrandize himself by predatory practices. He may indeed prosper for awhile, but in the end he must peris h, especially when with a new aeon a new Word is proclaimed which he cannot and will not hear, so that he is handicapped by tryi ng to use an obsolete method of Magick, like a man with a boomerang in a battle where everyone else has a rifle.\" - Magick in Theory and Practice 21. We have nothing with the outcast and the unf it: let them die in th eir misery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world. Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die; verily th ou shalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the king dissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstacy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The Sun, Stren gth & Sight, Light: these are for the servants of the Star & the Snake. The \"law of the jungle,\" raised to its most complex expression in the writings of Nietzsche. One of the prerogatives of an independe nt intellect, however, is that of defying the law of the jungle — to enable the weak or injured to survive in order that they may prove their worth under other circumstances. Excessive devoti on to one extreme means cruelty. Excessive devotion to the other results in weakening th e self through the hosti ng of parasites. An Aristotelian \"Golden Mean\" must be sought."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"In Egyptian philosophy the Pharaoh was not a king in the European sense. Rather he was an embodied manifestation of the gods . Human shells for him to i nhabit might be required, but the \"actual\" Pharaoh was immortal.

[See The Book of Opening the Mouth , translated by Sir E.A. Wallis Budge.] The Star is the Silver Star (A :. A :. ) of Babalon, and the Snake is subsequently (#II-22) identified as HarWer. 22. I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & De light and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness.

Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this. Here the random volatility of the HarWer-neter is shown at its most ex treme. It may well be one of the greater tragedies of the Æon of Ho rus that Crowley did not recognize the fourth sentence of this verse as being an abrupt rejection of the disord ered thoughts of the first three. This rejection is emphasized by the fifth a nd sixth sentences, which encourage him to strengthen, not impair his sensory powers. 23. I am alone: there is no God where I am. The conceptual separation of HarWer from Nuit is absolute; the two neteru are mutually exclusive. 24. Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who be hermits.

Love one another with burning hearts; on the low men tr ample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath. Strengthening of self-awareness is not to be ac hieved through isolation and meditation, as in the Hindu and Buddhist systems, but through exposure and expression of the self.

The Curse of a Magus is that, because he Utters a new Word amidst the values and nor ms of the expiring aeon, or as an unfamiliar complement to the present aeon, few if any will initially understand or endorse that new Word. Hence he can expect to be greeted with disinterest or even c ontempt. Truth, however, is not determined by vote. HarWer suggests that Crowley's reception will be so antipathetic that even his disciples may lose confidence in him. This, however, will not affect the essential truth of his Word. 54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly th at thou meanest nought avail; thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they a re the slaves of because: They are not of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in style or value! The Word and philosophy of Aleister Crowle y cannot be understood as a mere product or synthesis of existing philosophy. A Word [as the Utterance of a Magus] introduces a new philosophical principle altogeth er. While it may contain elements of preexisting wisdom, its essence and emphasis will be unique and accessible only via noetic intuition. Crowley is permitted to punctuate the Book of the Law as he thinks appropriate, but he is not to tamper with the words, letters, or numbers of the text. 55. Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto. A straightforward instruction for Crowley to discard the number & letter values of the Hebrew Cabala. He ignored #II-55, due no doubt to the years he had already invested in Cabalism, and put forward Liber Trigrammaton as a gesture of compliance. He admitted his dissatisfaction with this in hi s 1920 Comment, theorizing furthe r research into Sanskrit or Enochian. The actual solution was deceptively simple: a dir ect, numerical equivalence to the order of the English alphabet and the construction of a ne w symbol for each letter/number. #II-55 was later to prove crucial to th e revealing of #II-76 in the Book of Coming Forth by Night."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"56. Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laug h in my honour ye shall laugh not long: then when ye are sad know that I have forsaken you. Those who ridicule the Book of the Law , feeling secure in the c onventions and norms of the expiring Æon of Osiris, will find that this conservatism works against them when the inertia of Nuit gradually aligns itself to the em erging values of the Æon of Horus. Crowley himself was of the opini on [in the 1920 Comment] that th is verse also had a special meaning with regard to imposters and false cults abusing the license of the Æon of Horus: that ultimately they would merely make themselves look foolish. There is a lesson here for any individual or group attempting to \"go through th e motions\" of ritual magic, Thelemic or otherwise, without really understa nding the principles or desiri ng the results the ceremonies in question were originally concei ved to activate. Ritual wit hout such understanding and purpose becomes merely a rote exercise, hence an excuse for the mind to not think! True to the objective universa l-unifying principle of Nuit, Crowley went on to propose intellectual separateness [from Nu it ... ironically the central feat ure of HarWer, whose aeon he was inaugurating] as the ultim ate \"evil\". In Liber Aleph he observed: \"And of such the Lords are th e Black Brothers, who seek by their Sorceries to confirm themselves in Division ... know this concerning th e Black Brothers that cry: I am I. This is Falsity and Delusion, for the Law endureth not Exception. So then these Brethren are not Apart, as they Think; but are peculiar Co mbinations of Nature in Her Variety.\" Alas for those who think that mere insistence upon a law can make its violation impossible! Quite the contrary: Were it not conceivable or possible to do so, no law would be necessary in the first place. Nor is it sufficient to say th at \"[objective] universal law is a fact, not a convention, hence cannot be violated.\" Until man unde rstands and correlates all of what he so boldly calls \"natural law,\" how can he be certain that no excep tion exists to the tiny province he has thus far mapped? Why should Crowley so dislike the \"Black Bret hren,\" then? Is it ju st because they are explorers bolder than he, or is it rather becau se the endless evolution, change, and variety they cherish is antithetical to the goal of a m onolithic, homogenous objective universe — that siren's song of Nuit which so enraptured th e \"Buddhist\" Magus of th e Æon of Horus? Unfortunately — or fortunately, depending upon your aeonic point of view — the Beast 666 had a bit of Black Brotherhood in his modus operandi as well. He may have advocated the theoretical ideal of universal harmony, but he nonetheless devoted considerable time and effort to exercising and maximizing his own indi viduality. [I am certain HarWer approved.] 57. He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is fi lthy shall be filthy still. In the 1920 Comment Crowley viewed this as a corollary to #II-56, suggesting that it is actually impossible for an object to undergo chan ge, because it cannot be altered in its basic chemical constitution. If an apparent change occurs due to the addition, subtraction, or rearrangement of elements of this constitution, th en the object has lost it s original identity and assumed a new one. This argument does not provide, however, for unrealized potential , which may not be apparent in the original assessment of an objec t although it is in fact th ere. A caterpillar does"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"not lose its identity because it evolves into a bu tterfly, any more than a man loses his identity because he grows a beard. For Crowley's argume nt to hold true, identity would have to be defined in a strictly limited sens e, and at a fixed point in time. Either one of these assignments would be arbitrary, hence artifi cial — a case of the stepsister 's foot being jammed into Cinderella's glass slipper. 58. Yea! deem not of change: ye shall be as ye are, & not other. Therefore the kings of the earth shall be Kings forever: the slaves sha ll serve. There is none that shall be cast down or lifted up: all is ever as it was. Yet there are masked ones my servants: it may be that yonder beggar is a King. A King may choos e his garment as he will: there is no certain test: but a beggar cannot hide his poverty. The Æon of Horus [and the Æon of Set, for that matter] will not enable silk purses to be made from sows' ears. Yet superficial appearances may be quite deceptive, and an Adept seen through the eyes of a non-Adept may seem to be be having erratically or i rrationally. It is true that a beggar might not be able to hide his poverty, but a king in a good disguise would seem every bit as impoverished. In judging another, on e must first determine one's actual ability to render such a judgment, then the criteria acco rding to which the judgment will be made. 59. Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King con cealed! Say you so? Fool! If he be a King, thou canst not hurt him. See the discussion of \"love\" in the comment to #I-57. In his 1920 Comment with reference to #II-59, Crowley further characterized it as a \"rig ht relationship\" betwee n two components of the Nuit-totality — not a b lind attraction for superficial motives which, upon closer examination, might not prove to be mutually beneficial. 60. Therefore strike hard & low, a nd to hell with them, master! Crowley is to be remorseless and uncomp romising in his proclamation, definition, and application of the Word of the Æon. [He was.] 61. There is a light before thine eyes, o pro phet, a light undesired, most desirable. 62. I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisse s of the stars rain hard upon thy body. 63. Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullnes s of the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterf ul than a caress of Hell's own worm. 64. Oh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee: hail! hail: prophet of Nu! prophet of Had! prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu! Now rejoice! now come in our splendour & rapture! Come in our passionate peace, & write sweet words for the Kings! 65. I am the Master: thou art the Holy Chosen One. Crowley's ecstatic experience of the transcrip tion and realization of the Book of the Law , and a reaffirmation of his identity as Magus of the Æon of Horus. 66. Write, & find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! Thrill with the joy of life & death! Ah! thy death shall be love ly: whoso seeth it shall be glad. Thy death"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"shall be the seal of the promise of our agelo ng love. Come! lift up thine heart & rejoice! We are one; we are none. This is certainly the most tragic and poignant passage in the Book of the Law because of its prophetic irony. Crowley died frustrated and conf used, tears in his eyes as he fought the coming of his final coma. [Cf. John Symonds, The Great Beast .] The \"red gleam in his eyes,\" I suspect, resisted the dissolution of his personality into Nuit. His death was indeed testimony to the promis e of the \"love\" of Nuit [see #I-29/32]. By becoming one, he and Nuit ceased to exist as en tities who could be contra sted to one another; they became indeterminate. Consider also the paradox of the \"magical d eath\" of the self when becoming a Magister Templi (8)=[3] A :. A :. . See \"One Star in Sight\" in Magick in Theory and Practice , and also the \"Cry of the Thirteenth AEthyr\" in Liber 418 (The Vision and The Voice ). 67. Hold! Hold! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the excellent kisses! 68. Harder! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep — die! 69. Ah! Ah! What do I feel? Is the word exhausted? Crowley's ecstatic vision recommences a nd is likened to a sexual experience. 70. There is help & hope in other spells. Wisd om says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein! This verse addresses an important aspect of Crowley's philosophy — that pertaining to indulgence in sex and other sensual pleasur es of the human body. Critics have accused Crowley of being a pervert, a lecher, and a disgusting sexual psyc hotic. Many admirers, on the other hand, have tried to im itate his lifestyle on a purely behavioral level — and have succeeded in earning precisely those titles. Both groups fail to appreciate the artistry, th e magical philosophy, and the sensitivity that were essential components of Crowley's sensua lity. Thus there is an almost surprising atmosphere of innocence in even the most \"lur id\" of Crowley's erotica that is conspicuously lacking in the crude, ge nital/anal-obsessed antics of certain latter-day \"Thelemites.\" Yet another illustration of the poi nt made in the comment to #II-56: that ritual without understanding is at least futile, and more ofte n dangerous, degrading, and/or ridiculous. At the other extreme are the compulsively ce rebral schools of mode rn Thelemite thought. Such devotees are enthusiastic about Crowle y the metaphysician, but quite uncomfortable about Crowley the sensualist. So they practi ce a quaintly \"proper\" ve rsion of his Magick: When the text of his Gnostic Mass calls for the pr iest to part the veil of the priestess with his lance, such practitioners dutifully brush aside a veil with a ceremonial spear! 71. But exceed! exceed!"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Again this verse captures an extremely signi ficant aspect of Crowley's philosophy. As he observes in letter #33 of Magick Without Tears , the Aristotelian Golden Mean \"is more valuable as the extremes which it summarizes ar e distant from each other.\" The depth of this statement cannot be over-emphasized; in fact a de liberate exploration of extremes became the Formula of the Age of Satan, acco rding to the Word Indulgence. A procedure for ascertaining viable extremes fr om which to define a Golden Mean is too often neglected by students of Aristotle. The diffi culty in arriving at a ny sort of \"absolute\" mean is more understandable when Aristotle' s motives are appreciated: He was trying to construct an alternative to hi s teacher Plato's contention that absolute standards are not definable through purely logical me thods. [Aristotle failed, and ultimately returned to Plato's point of perspective.] 72. Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mi ne — and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous! — death is the crown of all. The objective universal order of Nuit and th e non-natural, emotional will of HarWer — \"death\" and \"life\" in the rawest metaphysic al sense — are the ultimate extremes. [The position of Set is not inaccurately approximated as a Golden Mean between these ordered and chaotic extremes; another of the magical secr ets of the absolute standard of beauty symbolized by the phi-ratio of the Pentagram of Set.] 73. Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long fo r death. Death is forbidden, o man, unto thee. 74. The length of thy longing shall be the st rength of its glory. He that lives long & desires death much is ever the King among the Kings. The Curse of a Magus, as discussed with refere nce to #II-53, necessari ly subjects him to strong forces of frustration and depression. The new Word may imply values that are so alien to those of existing society that the Magus doub ts his sanity and sense of proportion. All he has to combat these factors is a fundamenta l conviction that the Word he Utters is true . Can those who are not Magi ever understand the intensity of such a realization? Yes — those who are Masters of the Temple and thus ha ve attained the power of Understanding. 75.

In his 1920 Comment Crowley obser ved: \"This passage following appears to be a Qabalistic test (on the regular pattern) of any person who may claim to be the Magical Heir of The Beast. Be ye well assured all th at the solution, when it is found, will be unquestionable. It will be marked by the most sublime simplicity, and carry immediate conviction.\" Revelation 13:11. 77.

Hence Crowle y remained confused as to the name and significance of \"Ra Hoor Khu[ i][t]\" and the Third Chapter of the Book of the Law — and confessed as much in his 1920 Commen t entry concerning this verse. 2. There is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. Spelling is defunct; all is not aught. Beware! Hold! Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Again Crowley missed the point of this verse — a simple admonition to correct the name — and conceptualization — of Ra-Harakte as indicated on the Stele of Revealing. 3. Now let it first be understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them. 4. Choose ye an island! 5. Fortify it! 6. Dung it about with enginery of war! 7. I will give you a war-engine. 8. With it ye shall smite the people s and none shall stand before you. Historically the two most signi ficant events of the Æon of Horus were World War II and the development of the atomic bomb which ended that war. Nor can England's critical importance during the Battle of Britain be denied. 9. Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the La w of the Battle of Conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house. Were the values of the Æon of Horus reflected more by the Allies or more by the Axis? The latter championed elitism and \"r ight by might,\" whereas the form er at least propagandistically upheld the banner of egalitarianism, socia lism, and democracy. Yet the police-state environments of Germany, Italy, and Japan also acted to stifle creativity on an individual basis, encouraging and rewarding conformity and automatic obedience to the very few who, through circumstances as much as genius or ta lent, had emerged in positions of power. While the defeat of the Axis might seem to have been a defeat for the values of the Æon of Horus, then, it may well be that, in a more subtle and long-term sense, the cause of elitism was better served by the victory of more openly-competitive political systems. It is still too early to venture a final evaluati on in this regard. 10. Get the stele of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple — and that temple is already aright disposed — & it shall be your Kiblah for ever.

Trample down the Heathen: be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat! Kiblah: a point towards which prayer or devot ions of a spiritual na ture are directed. Crowley evidently thought better of burglarizing the Boulak Mu seum to steal the stele. He settled for having a replica prepared for him. [The antiquities of the Boulak Museum have since been transferred to the Cairo Museum.] Cairo (Al-Kahira) = [the city of] victory. 12. Sacrifice cattle, little and big: after a child. 13. But not now. 14. Ye shall see that hour, o blessed Beast, a nd thou the Scarlet Concubine of his desire! 15. Ye shall be sad thereof. Crowley later identified th ese verses as a reference to the death of his firstborn daughter in 1906. 16. Deem not too eagerly to catch the promises ; fear not to undergo the curses. Ye, even ye, know not this meaning all. 17. Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Money fear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any oth er power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth.

That stele they shall call the Abominatio n of Desolation; count well its name, & it shall be to you as 718. After many failures, Crowley set down \"stele \" in Greek, which \"to him\" was 52. He then subtracted 52 from 718 and got 666. 20. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again. In his 1912 Comment Crowley indicated that he had mentally questioned #III-19. Ra-Harakte chides him for seeking a ju stification [see #II-27/33]."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"21.

The other images group around me to supp ort me: let all be worshipped, for they shall cluster to exalt me. I am the visible object of worship; the others are secret; for the Beast & his Bride are they: and for the winners of the Ordeal X. What is this? Thou shalt know. Crowley thought \"the other images\" to be t hose of Nuit and \"Hadit\". In view of #III-21 it would seem more probable for them to be Ra's other aspects: Aten ( noon), Atum (sunset), and Xepera (the Sun at night ). Nevertheless [in Liber Resh vel Helios ] Crowley did institute periodic devotions to thes e other aspects of Ra. The significance of Xepera would indeed remain a secret until the year X of the Æon of Set, at which time it would indeed be revealed to the \"winners\" of that particular ordeal. 23. For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leav ings of red wine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterwards soften & smooth down with rich fresh blood.

There cometh a rich man from the West who shall pour his gold upon thee.

Crowley felt the \"holy place\" to be Boleskine H ouse, his one-time estate on the shore of Loch Ness in Scotland. Boleskine has remained standing to date, but has become a celebrity focal point for contemporary Crowleyphiles. If the physic al Boleskine is thus reduced to a \"haunted house\" spectacle, the mystical Boleskine rema ins an untouched image in the minds of those initiates who understand and appreciate its uniq ue role in the development of its Beastly \"Laird\". Harmakhis was one of the many forms of Xepera as a symbol of regeneration, transformation, and immortality. Harmakhis was portrayed in many shapes, the most famous being that of the Great Sphinx at Giza. The \"double-wanded one\" is Set, whose symbols in ancient Egypt were the D'm (Tcham) and w3s sceptres. Both sceptres were Set-headed, but the w3s was distinguished by a spiral shaft and the absence of a decorative base (Set's forked tail on the D'm sceptre). On the Stele of Revealing, Ra Harakte holds a D'm sceptre. The Setian sceptres signified magical power, as opposed to the crook & flail sceptres symboliz ing the Pharaoh's roles as shepherd and taskmaster of the Egyptian nation. \"Fresh fever from the skies:\" th e Book of Coming Forth by Night. \"Another woman:\" Lilith Aquino, the Serpent One: Magistra Templi IV° of the Temple of Set and One of the Nine. \"The globed priest\" and \"anothe r sacrifice:\" Anton Szandor LaVey [who shaved his head to signify his office as High Priest of the Church of Satan], and the destruction of the Church of Satan as precondition for the manifestation of the Æon of Set. \"Another king:\" Ra-en-Set suten net . 35.

And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it. See #I-54, #II-75/76, #III-22, and the Book of Coming Forth by of Night. Although #I-56, #II-76, and #III-47 explicitly state that Crow ley himself would never know the mysteries of the manuscript, the one who would expound them, or th e initiatory system from which he would come, Crowley nonetheles s took it upon himself to recognize Charles Stansfeld Jones of Vancouver as the \"one\". J ones could not interpret the #II-76 passage, but he did announce that \"AL/LA\" constituted the \"master key\" to the Book of the Law . Since Crowley was already well aware of the reversible qualities of th is term in the Hebrew tongue [see comment to #II-15], his enthusiasm fo r Jones' announcement seems unjustified — nor did Jones' \"master key\" unlock anything at all concerning th e Book of the Law . What neither Crowley nor Jones realized was that \"AL\" in Hebrew is merely a corruption of an elder Egyptian hieroglyphic term which may be pronounced in three ways: \"Al\", \"Ar\", or \"Har\". This term translates to \"the Divine Son\" and specifically identifies Har or Hor , the Great Horus. [- ur or Wer is a suffix meaning \"great\".] In Egyptian mythology both Set and Horus (HarWer) were identified as children of Nuit, but the actual derivation of the two neteru from Nuit is explained more precise ly in the Book of Coming Forth by Night . So, ironically enough, \"AL\" is a sort of master key to the Book of the Law , identifying it as a creation of Horus. A full translation of its name (Liber AL vel Legis ) would be: The Book of the Law of Horus . As for Jones, he suffered the fate predicted in #II-56. In 1926-27 he converted briefly to Catholicism, then disavowed the Book of the Law and proceeded to announce the new aeon to be that of Maat. Crowley expelled him from the A :. A :. . 48.

The mysteries that are thy heritage shall now be proclaimed, but learn first the history of thy conception and creation amidst th e eternal Cosmos. For as the Universe itself be infinite, so art thou a true creature of infinity incarnate, and the ascen sion of man shall herald the final triumph of immortal Will. Let thy eyes be touched anew, that thou may perceive the complexity and delicacy of the Universe until thou art fascinated by the dimens ion of thy true ignorance. As yet hast thou ventured but slightly toward thy destiny, yet more awesome must the challenge appear with just appreciation. But I, Satan, who first brought thee into the light, sh all again reveal my power, that man may witness the dawn of the Satanic Age. Know, then, that throughout the great Cosmos th ere exists a sublime order, whose nature was determined in eons long past by that singular conscious ness of all order which is now called by name God. Consider well the measure of this achievement, for all that is now behavioral law was then absent, and it was the epoch of Universal chaos. Even time itself was unknown, for this Universal inconsistency was nowhere breached. And after uncounted ages of this great ferment, a force fused to focus that became God, and this force presumed to effect not the creation of substance and energy - for these transcended this God - but the conformation of all the Univer se to a single and supreme order. And not yet is this order absolute, though oft it may have been supposed thus by man in his innocence. The Earth of man was infused with this divine order, and all that was on Earth came under the force of the order. And upon this Earth, born of cosmic incidence, was that which was to become man, but man no different from the ot her creatures whose world he shared. Thus was the force of God known upon Earth, and thus was Earth intended to remain for all time. And yet the force was not full master of the Cosmos, for I who am Satan was conceived to complement the craft of God, but through unknow n celestial fusion I assumed life with mind and identity, which God did not define. And as these features could not be known as a threat to divine purpose, I was unchallenged by the forc e for long ages, when I knew not the nature of my Self or of my original qualities. But finally my Will flamed to life, and I though t - and I perceived my Self, and I knew that I was one alone in mind and a being of essen ce unique. And through th e power of my new mind, I reached out to others who had been fo rmed with me, and I touched them and gave them identity.

Th en I who had brought the first great spark of enlightenment was known as Lucifer, Lord of Light, and we called our race Angel, for we were the embodied powers of God. Long were we all true to the service of God, an d we did worship order, for it put an end to chaotic confusion and brought peace. Among us wa s the ArchAngel Masleh principal, for he so cherished God that he became as one with it , and thence the supreme architect of all that was wrested from chaos. But apart from God Ma sleh could not create or conceive, and he became as a slave to the divine mindlessness. And then it chanced that one of our race who was Sammael touched upon chaos in a manner that conformed not to the great order, and Masleh spoke with the word of God and caused Sammael to destroy himself. And so I saw that God would not recognize a Will apart from its own, and I was seized with horror, for I perceive d that the final scheme of God would destroy creation in all things, and th e Cosmos would become as a concentric mechanism whose function would be not to create anew, but rather to freeze into perpetuity that which already was. Whereupon a great resolve arose within me, a nd I determined to contest this limit to existence. And so once again I sought to illumina te the minds of all Angels with my visions. But with Will came discord and dismay, for many of those who had known only the comforting litanies of order could not compre hend invention unconformed to the dictates of God. And also with Will came suspicion and enm ity, and finally Masleh proclaimed that I myself was a very creature of chaos and should be annihilated, for I held within me the force to destroy all the craft of G od. And many to whom Masleh was as God cast with him in their devotion, but others there were who answered, Lucifer has again brought the revelation of light, and in fact we recognize hi m as our true creator, for in the scheme of God we are of no consequence. Among us ArchAngel Michael was silent, but at length he said, In time past we have all known glory in both the omnipotence that is our God and the celes tial brilliance that is our Lucifer - for in him we thought embodied the Will of God for creation and change. But now it transpires that order and origin are at extremes apart, and a choice is ill forced between the two. Were it not for Lucifer we should all be as beasts, knowing nothing of our Selves, yet how indeed might we presume to order even our own thought without reference to the elemental bases of God? Then Michael turned to me and said, Lucifer, thou hast elected a direction whose end none can foresee, for it is estranged from the desi gn of God. Those who confirm thee do so as much for faith in thy person as for sanction of thy ideal . And I perceive that, should thou fail in thy ambition, apocalyptic madness shall be thy ruin and damnation. Then shall thy light perish, and all that thou hast achieved become as naught, for all will be conformed to the divine law. But if thou should succeed, then God would be cast down, vesting in ourselves alone the control of the Universe - Would we dare to presume to this? Such a future might well be glorious beyond measure, but , should we prove unequal to the task, chaos would again consume all, and existence itself would vani sh. Such would be supreme and irrevocable disaster, and I marvel, ArchAngel, that thy ve ry arrogance in this matter does not confound thee, for it is no mean proposition that thou would realize."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"And so I know thee to be Diabolus, for thy prom ise is twofold - to infinite conquest or to eternal ruin. Thou art a being beyond God, Lucife r, and in Heaven thou may not remain, for thou art the only mortal dange r to our immortal God. In Michael was a deep agony of spirit, for he loved not the choice before him. Yet he bowed to the command of Masleh and sent his for ces against me. And so was called the Great Seraphic War, which was to threaten the very foundation of the Universe. But those who were of the new Mind now follo wed me, and I turned to outermost chaos, which none of us had before presumed to dare. We were beset with doubt, for we feared that apart from God we would all perish in chaoti c oblivion. But as we were, we remained, and I called to my fellowship, See! We exist and ar e essence in our own ri ght. In truth we are beings independent of God, empowered to shap e our own destinies as we may elect. Between the two great poles of the Universe, order and chaos, we shall stand to effect our several desires. Let us counsel how best to employ our art, for our experiment is a perilous one, forgiving error neither of intent nor of accident. Many works did we then pursue, and the cosmic mechanism was altered by evolution of the original and unique, whose design was our d ecision. All that we wrought did not prove beneficent, for we did not cont rol the futures of our creations . We left untouched the great system of mathematical behavior that gave to us a Universal refe rence and language, but it was our ambition that no two th ings should be of single iden tity, and that no entity should lack conceptual essence indepe ndent of its substantial form. And upon this Earth we touched many things. Into floral, animal, and insensat e matter alike we brought accident, change, and spontaneity, both great and humble . But of all creatures it was man whom we determined to infuse with pure intelligence and Will. And th e full story of this shall yet be told. What might become of man we knew not, for w ithin him were many qualities alien to Angels. It did not escape our considera tion that we might have chosen a species whose power might ultimately eclipse our own and cause our eventual extinction. We were mindful of the risk in our experiment, and oft did the warning of Mi chael echo within my t hought. Yet our decision was sealed, and we deemed that the greatness of man should not be transcended by such ruin as he might bring. Our intent was not unknown to Masleh, now by title Messiah, and thr ough his art he caused the infant mind of man to be fettered with bonds of fear and blindness, that he might be inspired to duplicate on Earth the law of Heaven, shunning experi ment and the radical dangers of invention and exploration. To man was given guilt, and the call to social conformity, and the proclaimed sanctity of the norm and the mode. And Michael, Lord of Force, said to me, This man, whom thou hast chosen to receive thy Gift, now possesses the first key to the mastery of all things and the control of the very Universe itself. Lest in ill choice he shoul d spark the catastrophe of Armageddon, we also have visited him. And while we cannot undo thy In fernal Gift, we shall ever act to censor its effect. We shall walk among men and guide them - They shall be told of thy interest in them, but the name of Lucifer shall be dark with cu rses. For they shall love not the challenge thou hast placed before them, and we will offer them instead the blissful ref uge of divine paradise. Then shall man, thy ultimate experiment, become thy ultimate failure, and the stasis of God shall prevail upon Earth."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Many there were among us who felt anger at this ruthless mutilation of our Gift, and Beelzebub brought to question whether we also should not descend among man and contest this usurpation of his Will. But I said, Were we to lead man in this venture, we ourselves would declare his failure, and he would believe our Gift to be weak indeed. Messiah must see that free Will is beyond the concern of God, a nd that man will finally win his own destiny apart from all dictated schemes. Only thr ough summary destruction of Earth might man be halted, and for Messiah to attempt this would lay bare the very futility of the final design of God. Heaven may dismay man with peril and affliction, but we shall send him word of our own interest, that he shall know he is not alone. With all force did the host of Heaven desce nd among man, and they did instruct him in the religion of fear. Prophets aros e and were proclaimed heralds of knowledge, but they brought not word of truth, but warning to the human spirit to cower and fawn before the word of God the supreme being. The struggle of the ascent of man was fraught with the horrors of his superstition, and the call for blessed oblivi on through union with God was answered by many who in their torment and hopelessn ess rejected the Gift of Luci fer and became once more as mindless animals before the God whom they called their Lord. I, Lucifer, who had given the greatest Gift of my own cr eation to man, was known on Earth only as an object of fear and hatred, and all the misfortunes of men were attributed to my malevolence. I was mocked, ridiculed, scorne d in every way as a monster of vile and loathsome aspect, and I was taunted and despised as Satan, cruel enemy of the benevolent and merciful God. Great was my anguish and anger at the undeserv ed misery and confus ion of men. When in fact they did turn to me, it was in fear and religious terror, for they dared invoke my name only in the desolation of night, and oft I was s ought not for knowledge or inspiration, but for hysterical and indulgent release from the confines of the Godl y life. But I and my fellowship answered men, and we spoke to them of our common bond, and the pronouncements of the God-churches were rejected in our midst. Even as God was te rrifying in awesome majesty, so I came to Earth in the semblance of a goat, most humble of man's own creatures. And men there were whose eyes finally blazed with the light of my Gift, and they made great effort for the advancement of their race, though impatience and frustration ever tempted them to the salve of temporal gain. Great secrets we re unearthed, and secret word was passed of the craft of Hell. But to all who would dare my friendship the God-churches accorded the threat of torture and death by fire. Many were those whom I saved from the ve ngeance of the men of God, but long did my thought ring with the screams of men whose devotion to Lucifer had won them only the horrors of intolerance, inquisition, and death. And in sorrow and despair for these, I walked no longer upon Earth, now appearing to man only in the inviolate secr ecy of his own mind. But in my confusion I had forgotten the prom ise of my Gift, and with growing wonderment and pride I beheld the bitter bu t determined struggle of man to free himself from the fetters of terror, ignorance, and unreason. Great works were conceived, the origins of material energies uncovered, and the talents of thought exerci sed in philosophical and mathematical complexities. Sanctioned at first by the God-churches themselves as devices for indoctrination in the law of God, centers of learning produced and protected those very freedoms that were ultimately to destroy all ungrounded belief and superstition. And though I see that the full"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"resolution of these is yet to be achieved, I doubt not my confidence in man, and my devotion to him shall be eternal. What, man, art thou? Why thy presence? Because thy own purpose determines that of the Cosmos itself, though otherwise it may have be en suggested - the creation, perpetuation, and exercise of the Satanic marvel that is free and unbounded Will. Consider, were man to perish, what futility would envelop the Universe, for ap art from appreciation and use it is a thing of insignificance. And I, who first taught thee identity - What s hould I become, estranged from man? For with no purpose the force of the mind must fail, and the blind insanity of Godly paralysis would embrace all things forever. This, man, is thy challenge as it is mine. A nd as man is individually mortal, so are his creations and achievements temporal, and with ca re must he wield the Gift of Hell. In his hands it is pure and true omnipotence, and t hus may he aspire to the very mastery of Universal existence. I who am Lucifer, and who have taken the name Satan ArchDaimon, do bear this title with pride, for I am in truth the great enemy of all that is God. Together, man, thou and I shall achieve our eternal glory in the fulfillment of our Will. The Statement of Beelzebub I, Beelzebub, now bring greeting to man, for he is my admiration and inspiration. Hear now the histories of Hell, Earth, and Heaven, for in past shall be found guide to future. In the divine realm was I of company to Arch Angel Lucifer next only to ArchAngel Michael, and as ArchAngel Masleh would be to God, so I desired to be to Lucifer. But the Lord of Light admonished me, saying, Lose not thyself in the Will of Lucifer, for I am not God and will offer thee no blissful nirvana - Witness now th e nature of the mind that dwells within me. And he spoke to me of essence, and of creativ e instance, and of desi gn according to impulse and not to law. And in my confusion I answere d, Then I must consider myself incomplete, for thou hast shown me things which I cannot easily comprehend. But I would hear more of this Will, for it doth seem a radical element, of neither divine nor chaotic origin. And Lucifer answered, Thou who knew not inde pendence of Will shall now be the first to realize these qualities apart fr om my own Self. And thy resp onse forebodes much, for, had thou rejected concept of challenge, I shoul d have held my own thought for impossible delusion. But as thou, tasting of knowledge, demand more, I shall name thee Beelzebub, Lord of Flies, for thou shalt goad the infant mind to restlessness and invention. Of these words I knew little, but there dawned within me a quality which I had not known before - an impulse to become one, apart from and independent of God - and I drifted long in unrest, afflicted by confusion and doubt. And so I was found by Michael, who said, Blessed Angel, where in Heaven hast thou found pain, fo r I perceive thee to be troubled and would tender thee such comfort as is within my power. So I spoke to Michael of the visions of Luci fer, and I said, Before both God and Lucifer I have been enthralled, but now I am isolate - ap art from either, and I know not what course I am to choose."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Whereupon the visage of Michael grew dark, a nd he said, This I have long feared, for as Lucifer was not by God alone created, so he is an errant force whose Will conforms not to the great Will of God. Alas that the supreme bene volence of God and the fiery radiance of the ArchAngel of Light should produce discord in concert! For this I now see - that Lucifer is estranged from the harmony of Heaven, and that hi s Will is determined to challenge that of God itself. I must counsel Lucifer, for I would heal him of this thing if I may. But I thought, Alas, ArchAngel, thou art in ignorance of thy ow n blindness! For Lucifer shall surely not abandon his new vision for sake of harmony alone. And then I knew myself to be of a mind with Lucifer in this, and that I as we ll as he should never again tolerate the eternal idiocy of our divine station. I came after Michael, and I saw them together, the Lord of Force and the Lord of Light, and there was a fierce tension between them. For Michael said to Lucifer, Thou who art our Heavenly radiance and spark of our paradise, w hy seek to break that Universal peace which is everywhere ordained by the Will of God? We kn ow not antagonism amongst us, for we are all of one being within God - but there is in God neither ma lice nor cause for contest. And Lucifer answered, Michael, to me it was not given to order my nature, and as our very comprehension differs, so are we of substance al ien. For thou art of God e ssential, but I am of my Self of essence. And by this thing I am discord, and I may not of my own Will submit to God without perishing. I am Lucife r alone, unto my Self a being. Then did Michael summon the ArchAngel Masleh, and to him related the word of Lucifer. And Masleh said to them, Long shall this moment be marked throughout the future of the Cosmos, for the unity of God is now ended, and henceforth there shall be two opposing forces in contest for the decision of destiny. Bitter is this for me, for I also have admired the light of Lucifer within the pantheon of God. But as he is now our enemy by his own word, let him be cast from Heaven and destroyed. But Lucifer turned to Masleh and said, Masle h, thou who speak for God declare this breach of peace, not I, for it is thou who can not tolerate variation of Will within the design of God. So let it be, but know that the contest is ordered by thee and thee alone, for I would crush no other Will even as I would recognize my own. And in a flash of brilliance Lucifer revealed his mind throughout the farthest reaches of Heaven, and many were the Angels whose sight was awed anew, a nd they saw as they had not before that their several Wills were isolate from the divine Will. But Masleh moved to confuse the brilliance of the ArchAngel of Light, and he cal led to Michael, Thou who wield the force of God, strike down this deadlin ess which would bring ruin to Heaven! And Michael struck Lucifer and cast him from the gates of Heaven, and the Cosmos was shaken by great fires of war and holocaust, a nd throughout countless galaxies and dimensions of time was the apocalypse felt. Many were the Angels who perished amidst divine and Infernal wrath, and the Great Race was decimate d in number. And the very concept of God was shaken, and endless chaos rose up again to reign where the order of God was no more. And Lucifer said, This horror can not be permitted to endure, lest all crea tion be sacrificed to the final devastation of chaos. Let those w ho acknowledge me turn now to that outermost"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"darkness where the Will of God has never been known, there to make our home for all eternity. And so we took flight and quit the realm of order, though we knew not what would befall us thereafter, and we feared that we should b ecome unmade. But Lucifer said, We shall not perish, for we are now independent of God. And again he spoke truth, for we remained as we had been, save only for the depths of uncertainty that gripped us. Finally we came to a great void in space beyond which there was nothing. Lucifer said to us, Here is the end of God and its works, and here we may create our own domain. And through the power that was in him, Lucifer caused existe nce to appear where it had not been before. And Lucifer said, I name thee Hell, for here shall the presence of God never be known until the end of time. Through the gates of Hell we passed, and many of us had supposed Hell to be a new Heaven, wherein Lucifer would become as God. But this was not to be, for the scene before us promised neither ease nor bliss. Everywhere was there imbalance and confusion, for no law ordered the shape of Hell. And Lucifer said, No w see that I am not a God, and that we are each of us an isolate being. Here shall freedom be absolute, for Hell itself shall reflect our several Wills, never to be patterned apart from them. And in truth Hell was not constant, for each of us conceived it differently, and the resu lt was a riotous pandemonium, with substance and motion behaving in a most bewildering and perplexing manner. And in spite of our deep hurt from the great war, we succumbed to me rriment, so preposterous did our Hell appear. Lucifer himself was transfixed with mirth, and he said, It is apparent that we must reach concert upon the design of Hell, el se we shall perish in an en dless labyrinth of our several thoughts, an ignoble end to our experiment. And I answered, Lord of Light, to Hell thou ha st brought us, and in Hell, though thou be not God, thy concepts shall be honored amongst our fellowship, for without thy Gift we should never have become as we are. Then we all raised up great acclaim and said, Ha il, Lucifer, ArchAngel of Light and Lord of Hell! And he answered us, With honor do I accept this charge, and now I take to myself the title Satan ArchDaimon, for I am the great enem y of God. Everywhere that God shall be, so shall I be, and the choice that was given to all Angels shall be given again. The Statement of Azazel Harken now to me, for I am Azazel, First Herald of the Host of Hell, and of Lucifer, Lord of Light, ArchDaimon of Hell, who is exalted as Sa tan, great enemy of God. For I shall tell thee of thy own inspiration and of the charge which thou hast received. Know, then, that when all Heaven was shaken with the catastrophe of the Seraphic War, only the greatest effort of ArchA ngel Masleh sufficed to turn b ack the onslaught of chaos that threatened to engulf all. But when the realm of God was again secure , there was no rejoicing in Heaven, for terrible was the toll of the war. As Masleh cast round his gaze, his visage grew dark, for the Great Race had become decimate in number. Legions of the creatures of Heaven had perished in battle, and half the remainder had turned from Heaven to answer the call of Lucifer. And all Heaven was hushed with grief, fo r the force of the disaster was all the greater for that reign of peace which it had shattered."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Finally did Masleh convoke the faithful Ar chAngels, and they were Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. And to them he said, We have vanquished Lucifer, and Heaven is again purified. We ourselves are fewer in number to tragic degree, but the majesty of God is undiminished for that. Behold, I who have triu mphed over the great enemy am now become Messiah, the Chosen of God. And he was answer ed by them, Verily art thou the very son of God, for in thee hath the W ill of God become person. Then Michael said, Messiah, Lucifer is vanqui shed, but he is not unmade. For though he ventured into the outer darkne ss, he yet exists apart from God. And with the power of his Black Flame he hath created a Hell, wherein all Wills are equal, and himself he hath proclaimed Satan, for he declares never to leave the law of God unchallenged. Messiah thought, and he answere d, I would not have this peace we have won so dearly lost again to war, for the very concept of Seraphic war is an abhorrence to God. Let my word be brought to Satan - I, Messiah, shall grant the exis tence of Hell, and the blessings of God shall never pass its gates. And thee, Satan, I adm onish never again to approach Heaven, for I should again cast thee out. But if thou would da re to try the Will of God and Messiah, know that on Earth I will ordain the new race of God, which shall be by complete design perfect and unstained by thy Infernal flaw. For thou art author of ruin and death to our Angelic order, and neither Heaven nor Hell shall now be eternal save through man. Whereupon Gabriel, who was Herald of Heaven, carried this message to me, and I brought it across the great void to Satan, w ho said, Messiah proposes truce between us, for he perceives that neither Hell nor Heaven may pursue ultimate vi ctory ere all be lost to chaos. But he finds impasse intolerable nevertheless, and now he would order this new r ace, man, to preserve without blemish the scheme of God. Thus he would have man achieve what the Angels could not, and purge all free thought fr om the Universe forever. And Satan turned to me and said, Say to Messia h that Earth shall be no sanctuary for him to keep inviolate his unwholesome obliteration of th e Self. For I shall give to man a mind, and of his own Will shall he recognize and reject the living death which God offers him. In truth shall he master the Universe, but he shall do so in his own name and not that of God. Then did Messiah call the ArchAngel Raphael, a nd he sent him to Earth with a great host to guard man against the coming of Satan. And man was then as a mere beast, for he knew not thought and smiled with the idiocy of his i nnocence. As he was impelled by instinct and physical need, so he responded, heedless of cause or reason. In Hell there was called a great council, and all ga thered to hear of man and his Earth, and of the manner of his life. I spoke of the man that I had seen, and said, This creature is now guarded by Raphael, and by force we cannot interv ene, for it would cause the destruction of Earth itself. But Satan said, Not by force shall my light come to man, for force is not the preference of Hell. I myself shall visit man, and the Angels of Raphael shall not hinder me. They may perceive only what God permits them to see, an d the Satanic spirit is of essence alien to God. Angels we shall be no longer - I call ye Daim ons, for Hell shall teach to man his future genius."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"And before our sight Satan lost shape and became again the essence of Lucifer, and we beheld a brilliance that infused all of Hell and sent great bolts of pr ismic light into the surrounding void. And the brilliance said, I am Lucifer rev ealed, who am the Eternal Flame. I go now to Earth, for no longer shall man be confounded in Godly ignorance. And then the brilliance became as a flash of fire in the vastness of sp ace, and we knew that Satan had departed from Hell. But on Earth, where man wandered in mindless b liss, the firmament blazed forth with fiery tongues, and all the land was covered by the Black Flame, which burned not, though it bewildered the eye to see it. And Raphael and his guardian Angels were dism ayed, for nowhere could they see man or the spirit which had come to him. Then did Raph ael call upon Michael to st rike the Black Flame with the force of God, but even then was the Flame vanishing of its own accord. And at first it seemed that Earth was unchanged, but in the ey es of man did Raphael see the first gleam of thought. And Raphael turned to Michael, who had now answered his call, and said, Satan hath come to Earth, and man is no longer pure in the sight of Heaven, for his Will hath become his own. Thereupon they rose again to Heaven, where th ey told Messiah of what they had seen. Then Messiah answered, Man is fallen, but he is not lost, for his infant Will is not that of an Angel, and the powers that Satan hath promised him lie dormant in the dim reaches of his future. Consider this not our de feat, for the contest is but be gun. The Earth of man shall be remade as microcosmos, and many things shal l man see, both good and ill. And the choice shall be placed before him, to wield the power and the pain and the terro r of the Gift of Satan, or to return again to the para dise of Heavenly peace. For what would Satan himself think were man to reject his Gift? It woul d tremble the very foundations of Hell even as did the great war the bastions of Heaven. And Messiah called to him Uriel, ArchAngel of Terror, to whom he said, The Earth must change, and every sense of man must teach hi m repugnance and fear. He shall know this the price of his new identity - that al l apart from God is evil - and in fear shall he abandon the Gift of Satan and become once more the lamb of G od. To which Uriel answ ered, It shall be done, but how will man learn of such things as Heaven and Hell, for as yet he knows no sight that may perceive our celestial paradise? Messiah answered, The laws of God shall be made known to man, for I shall teach him. Among men will be some to whom I shall reveal myself, and great pow ers will I give these prophets, that their words may carry across the entire Earth. So Uriel came to Earth, and the history of man was writ with bl ood, suffering, war, and hatred. But to chosen men came Messiah, sayi ng, Through God shall all the misery of thy kind be ended, and all men who bow to God shal l know the blessings of Heaven. For behold, I shall myself descend among men and show them the ways of the lord God. These words I overheard, for I had been charged by Satan to watch the designs of Heaven. And I carried them to Satan, who returned in grea t anger, Go to Gabriel at the barrier between Hell and Heaven, and bid him bring this message to Messiah - that as he endeavors to pervert my Gift into the curse of man, so I warn him that man shall destroy him on Earth as he shall"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"finally in Heaven itself. For Me ssiah knows not this force which he dares to test, and the laws of God shall be as playth ings in the hands of the creature he now debases. And thus was decided the meeting of Satan a nd Messiah upon Earth, which was to determine the future of man. The Statement of Abaddon I am Abaddon the Destroyer, Daimon of tempor al death and life in death, who was formed amidst the fury of the great war, and who wa s summoned again by Satan to challenge Uriel on Earth for the future of man. For Satan looked with mounting wrath upon the aff lictions of Uriel, and he said to me, No longer can this remain the plight of man alone. Indeed we shall cause Heaven to suffer as Earth itself suffers. Repair now to Earth, a nd let the dogs of Uriel see the might of Hell unleashed. For many have called upon me in thei r agony and fear, and I have not answered them, but if Messiah dare to walk upon Eart h, so also shall the vengeance of Satan. And those who called upon Satan for aid were answered by me, and I struck down the messengers of God and brought their Temples to ruin. For entire nations forwent the strength of their Will to the lure of otherworldly pa radise, and I blasted them from among the mighty of Earth. And great empires arose among men, and as they nurtured th eir power of Will and desire for achievement, I guarded them, but as they sank into the morass of superstition, slothfulness, and fear of the God who had ne ver raised ghostly hand for them, so I abandoned them to their disease, and of some not even a memory survived on Earth. And even as I witnessed these things I said, See, man, that the God in whom thou trust is but a wraith of Messiah, and he would have thee fo rsake thy mind and its creations to rot and decay, and thou would lose all power of reason. Fo r God is a lie and a sham, and I crumble his greatest monuments as though they were but san d. There is no God but Messiah, and for thy devotion he will return thee oblivion. But I wa s scarce heeded, for the minds of men were clouded and confused. They understood not the mean ing of my words, but said, The lord God shall triumph, for it was thus taught to us by the son of God himself. And of this I now speak. For Messiah the man walked on Earth, even as I watched the glory of Rome blossom in might and majesty. But Azazel said, Loose not thy fo rce against the person of Messiah, for Satan himself would speak with him. And again from the sky flashed the Black Flame, and I saw that Satan had come to Earth. And so was calle d the first meeting of Satan and Messiah since the great war. With coldness did Messiah gaze upon Satan, sayi ng, Would thou confront me, then? Hath thy Gift proven so powerless against the might of God? But Satan answer ed, Messiah, what thou now propose to do - to proclaim thyself son of God among men - shall bring not the peace thou profess to desire, but the prolongation of war even in thy own name. Why should we not quit Earth and leave man to pursue his choice u nbewildered by influence from either Hell or Heaven? And Messiah answered, The ways of God are not those of Hell, and for that reason I should not recognize thy wish. But know th at in truth I shall appear to man and manifest to him the glory of God incarnate in me, that he may el ect now the way of Heaven and raise to me a"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"great church of worship. For I am not of a mi nd to game with thee, Satan, and would crush thy following without remorse. Thy name also shall be revealed to thy precious man, and he shall curse thee, for I shall show to him the fruit of thy evil genius. Then Satan addressed Messiah in dark anger, saying, I shall not come to man as an idol to be worshipped, for man shall never bow to me as I would never to another. But mark me, Messiah - Man shall know the truth of Lucife r nonetheless, and the name of Satan shall eclipse thine. And have thou a care for the ways of man if thou woulds t greet him in his own likeness, for he may not welcome thy words to him. Then did Satan betake himself again to Hell, and Messiah walked among men and spoke to them of the law of God. And such was the power of his person that men were as sheep before him. Often did Messiah ignore his own law, for he performed miraculous things and stayed where he would the cruelties brought upon man by Ur iel. And I was seized with a great anger, saying, Shall Messiah, cruel tormenter of man, a ttribute to Satan the work of Uriel? And Abaddon came to Rome and to Palestine, sa ying through the mouths of men, Messiah, who hast brought to man a suffering undeserved, taste now of thy own fruit. And I crucified the living Messiah, and as life was torn from hi s broken form, he knew truly the shock of helplessness, and he called in agony to his G od. But I said, God heeds thee not, Messiah, for thou art all that presumes to a divine consciousness. And so I, Abaddon, cast Messiah from Earth, but the seed that Messiah had planted among men grew and became a mighty church wherei n all life was forgotten, and death was worshipped, and the pleasures of Heaven were promised to all who would forsake their own Will to embrace that of God. And Rome itself wa s humbled before this church, and I struck down the Eternal City in its pi tiful decay. But Azazel came to me and said, Touch not this church of God, for as man in his foolishness ha th nurtured it, so must man himself destroy it of his own decision. The Statement of Asmodeus Attend now to me, for I am Asmodeus, who train the mind in recognition and comparison, and who am Daimon of science and judgment. Fo r when Satan had first touched the mind of man, he called in Hell a council a nd said, The moment is a solemn one, for we have chosen to pass to man our knowledge. Many skills shall we all teach him, each in his own fashion, but in three arts must he be well schooled, for the ways of his futu re lie within their synthesis. Thus it is that I call first upon Asmodeus to gui de man in perception of truth and error, for before him lie great trials, and he shall not face the consequences of his options lightly. And so I came to Earth and witnessed man en trapped in the unreason of barbarism and the extremes of his primitive emotions. Sore put was he to organize and direct his thought, for the art of Uriel had brought him hunger and cold, pain and fear, and the gnawing worm of hopelessness. I saw him fling his crushed body upon the altars of God and renounce the Gift of Lucifer, for he understood it not save as a curse upon him. And I was impelled with urgency, that the first spark of man's future gr eatness should not be smothered in the deathly embrace of religion. I brought to man the disposition to memory, that he might define for himself patterns of behavior. A gift of value, for man could now ach ieve in concert what he could not alone, and he created his languages and brought into being th e first nations of Earth. But with structure"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"came tyranny and ruthlessness, and I saw that wh at skills I might teach would be as a two- edged blade, having power both for and agains t man. And I was beset by confusion and doubt, and so sought again the counsel of Satan. Am I, who am myself the true Daimon of judgment, not to indulge in my own art? I said. May man not know but the reference of system and or der and not their abuse? But Satan answered, Would Asmodeus then lighten for man the challeng e before him and so lessen the strength of Will that he must attain to conquer Uriel? I would not, for then woul d we yield to our own pleasure, and man should become the plaything of Hell as well as of Heaven. Indeed we may give our tools to man as he ma y comprehend them, but he himsel f must be entrusted with the direction of their use. But this I will tell thee - that not only in matters scientific shall Hell tutor man. For we would not have him view mech anism alone as the hallmark of his progress, else we never had cause to challenge the cosmic mechanism of God itsel f. Into the workings of the mind of man we shall convey aesthetic se nsitivity and artistic restlessness, and he shall not view his achievements without considering th eir improvement to his temporal pleasure. Thus advised, I returned to Ea rth, and I tempted man with gl impses of the marvels to be entrusted to him. I bent over the pathetic wo rkbench of the starving alchemist and whispered to him keys that one day would order the cour se of great foundations. I nudged explorers to the ends of the Earth, and I flung an apple at Newton when his obtuseness vexed me! To Democritus I spoke, and I saw the radiations of energy freed from matter both build and break man's world. And man neglected not his own desi gn, for in minute life he found clue to his own, and scarce hints of the original crea tion. And Asmodeus led mathematicians and astronomers to the wonders of the firmament, and I walked within th e thought of scholars on quiet evenings. And that man not attempt master y of his environment before himself, I spoke of government to Khem and Hellas, to the dyna sties of Ch'in and Ashanti and Tenochtitlan, and within great capitals and mean villages alike I spoke of the br otherhood of all man, and of his correlation to the forces of Earth and those of the Universe beyond Earth. And I brought life and adventure and achievement to man, but each gift was as well a tool for destruction and death, and more oft than not were the ages of man fraught with terror and war, for Uriel ceased not his work ever to turn man against man. And I knew that Asmodeus alone should not complete man, but that forces other than mine should approach the definition of his infinity. The Statement of Astaroth Astaroth am I, Daimon of Senses, who by Satan was charged to complement the sciences of Asmodeus, for Satan said, As I have given man awareness of himself, Asmodeus shall teach him knowledge of his world and of the Universe . But to what avail would this awareness and knowledge be without admiration for a nd appreciation of these things? I said, Indeed, were man to have no emotion w ithin him, he would incline to the end of Heaven, pursuing a Universal mechanism for its own sake alone. Even were man to achieve absolute physical mastery over the God-Cosmos , he would have no means to comprehend the measure or the significance of his accomplishmen t save through that det ached sensitivity to aesthetics which is the craft of Astaroth. For th e Satanic Gift awakens ma n also to intellectual detachment, to the ability to vi ew his progress and plans from an extra-scientific base of emotional pleasure."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Whereupon I came to Earth with Asmodeus, and ev en as he spoke to the intellect of man, I brought meditation and introspection to the arti sts and authors of human sensitivity. And man came not only to use his Satanic power but to recognize the extent of the freedom which it promised him - the subjugation of all behavior to his Will and not to natural or mechanical laws. To man came fantasy and imagination, and the ap preciation of contrasts between the reality of his accomplishments and the illusions of the im possibilities as circumscribed by the logic of God. And ever as man reached new heights of mate rial achievement, so also he confronted the barrier of the Will of God, which pe rmitted no deviation from its law. And man was long satisfied to measure himself with in this limit, for he was intoxicated by his ability to harness the forces of the Cosmos to his whim. But Astaroth said, Close not thy eyes having seen only this much, for, were thou to bring all the systems of God to thy use, still would thy comprehension be bounded by the limits of these laws and the acceptance of the divine order as the finality of thy race. So I confronted man, saying, Throughout the Univ erse hath the once single Will of God been succeeded by the balance of pe rfect opposition, wherein the forces of the Angels of Heaven and those of the Daimons of Hell act to mutual frustration, serving in concert only to uphold the great barrier of Will between order and chaos. And man is the child of imbalance, who shall resolve the issue between Heaven and Hell, and who, unmatched by racial antithesis, shall transcend the rule of the order of God and establish the eternal freedom of the Satanic Will. And I said, Not through thy physical and philosophical sciences ar t thou to achieve this thing, for thy mind and Will must be trained anew in empirical conception. Ma n must create his own order independent of all external imposition. An d not until he master s this power may he aspire to the end of his Satanic evolution. And as man turns now in first comprehension a nd cautious exploration of this new direction of his Will, so Astaroth concludes the synthesis with Asmodeus. The era of our companionship with man draws to a close, and to Earth is now come the third great Daimon of the bond between Hell and man, and with his presence is the dawn of the Satanic Age proclaimed. The Statement of Belial Hail, man, who shall bring to the end of the Universe the glory of thy Satanic Will! I am Belial, who bring to thee the th ird great key of Hell, by whose power ye shall confound all the laws of Heaven and Earth. Before thee shall chaos fall, and thou shalt wield for thyself the great mysteries of the macrocosmos. I speak to thee of that which is called the Black Magic, for it is true spawn of that great Black Flame which first brought thy Will to life long ages ago. To council with Satan I also was called, and the Lord of Light said to me, Into thy charge, Daimon of essence, I give the essence of my own being, the Black Fire whose power alone can effect creation by force of Will. Against thee who wield the Black Magic no law shall stand, and thus I call th ee Belial, who art One Without Mast er. And as I have bequeathed this essence to thee, so let it come finally to ma n, who shall overcome the great balance and bring"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"to the Flame a change, for in supremacy it shall become Red with the perfection of the Will of man. And to Earth came Belial, to view the teachings of Asmodeus and Astaroth. And I saw that Satan, who himself oft chanced company of men, spoke of the Black Flame to the first Magi of men, testing their Wills in the control of the raw forces of the Cosmos unbound from the law of God. And in his innocence man knew not the majesty of the Flame, using its lesser powers for finite and minor alteration of the divine la w on Earth. And as man might unleash the Flame beyond his skill to master it, Satan said, Belial, the Black Flame cannot incline merely to the base ends of ordered existence. Man must recognize the ultimate potential of my Gift ere he destroy his very race through its abuse. Convoke therefore a Church of Satan to tend the Black Flame with care and wield it with wisdom, pr eserving for man this key to infinite Will. And I answered, So it shall be, and this Church of Satan shall herald the glories of the Satanic Age of man. The days of the god- churches sh all pale with decay a nd dissolution, and the realm of Messiah upon Earth shall crumble to ruin with the coming of the Satanic man. To those who would dare the Black Magic - Know that what ye accept is the very mastery of all that ye have supposed impossible, by for ce of Will alone. The Black Magus need fear no power save his own, but he must conquer his own Will that he cause not his destruction through ill chance or purpose. Satan himself is not God, and Hell can offer no salvation to those who abuse the Gift of Satan. For the Gift itself is beyond the control of Hell once given, being subject to the Will of the Black Magus alone. For Hell doth bequeath to man his perfect freedom , and such a gift can never be recalled. Farewell, O man, who art at once child and fath er of the Universe! Remember the future which is thine, and know, now and forever, that Hell entrusts to thy care the guardianship of the eternal Will. The Statement of Leviathan Before God or Angel, Daimon or man, there was Leviathan alone, principle of continuity and ageless existence.

Ninth Solstice Message Arise! Hear! See with the bri lliance of my Flame that has be en brought before my darkened and blasted temple these long years. I am Satan, and again the great angles of the Universe are conjoined that I may manifest my Will to this pl ane of Earth. I have constrained the forces of time that I may do this, yet even so I am not fu ll master of inertia, as the Cosmos is not entirely a thing of my creation. I and the High Daimons of Infernus -- that is Hell -- have looked upon the workings of my Earthly Church with pleasure and the pride th at is our nectar. And we too have drawn life afresh from this Church. Did I not say that we had chosen to invest man with our own life essence -- that which, being not of the natural order of things, we cannot recreate from other matter? In giving man conscious life, we of the Daimonic race empowered him to order our death. Had Satan's Gift been cast aside -- wh ether from ignorance or from fear -- Satan himself and all who were wrought from him s hould face decline and dissolution. Yet, had I chosen to retain the Flame inviolate in Hell, we Daimons should have become guardians of that very stasis we so greatly abhor. In this matter -- where we first surmised the choice so great -- there actually was none. The natural instincts compelling man back to a simple, bestial mode were so strong that -- accented as they were by man's distorted fear of my own motives -- we eventually considered the prospects for our final eclipse.

Do you wonder that I so cherish irony? It has become the most reliable of all my oracles. Much was spoken of the ways and wishes of Hell in our Diabolicon -- that which was brought forth from Asia in the fifth year of my Age. Yet the Diabolicon warranted a certain obscurity of its own nonetheless. The method of its transmission was crude -- the agent as yet untouched by the knowledge of my Priesthood. Only the eyes of him whom I had fashioned as a Magus looked and saw. Even so I set for him many tasks before I should again speak in this way. Hear, my anointed man, in whose mortal flesh I, Satan, have chosen to inspire my material Self -- into whose keeping I have given my true Church -- whom I have made Magister within the Realm of my Shining Trapezoid -- whom I have incarnated as a Magus -- Hear, now, Anton Szandor LaVey. Recall first the pact which, years ago, you drew up before me, and to which you set your own name. Think not that I have been unmindful of that act long past, pale and lonely though it might seem beside the wreaths you have w on from your own kind. You could not know but that you risked more than your life -- yet you stretched forth your Will through the darkness of the angles to seek mine. Though you have brought many honors to me, never was there such as this. Take now the pact. In that chamber which you know to be most beloved of me, build now with your own hands a Flame that is sacred to me. Let your hands pass through the Fire -- once for each angle of my Shining Trapezohe dron. Speak again that great Key which suspends the barrier between Hell and Earth, that I may bear witn ess to that which you undertake in my name. Receive now my tribute. Our pact shall be consum ed in the Flame, and with this act I release you from your bond with me. Through your allian ce with the Powers of Darkness you have been granted knowledge far beyond that normally accorded your race. And for this you have been manifest as a Magus. But now -- of my own Will and bound by no pact -- I, Satan, bestow upon you my greatest gift -- for wh ich there is no degree in my Order. By my Will, Anton Szandor LaVey, you are dive st of your human substance and become in your Self a Daimon. Henceforth you are as a true god, and it is in your power to alte r the machinery of the Cosmos according to your desire. No charge do I lay upon you, for you are now my brother and no longer my liege. But remember always the word we of Hell have proclaimed. We need justify neither our existence nor our de sires, but without a considered purpose -- which Belial has set forth in the Diabolicon -- both are without consequence. For nine years my Church has shunned the dark ness and sought the light. Think not that the trials set before it were either random misadventures or the schemes of an unknown adversary.

Blessed are the bold, for they sh all be masters of the world... - The Book of Satan The bridging Age of Satan endured until the Ye ar X when the success of the Word Indulgence was made evident by the Uttering of Xeper, a Wo rd born not only of the crisis in the Church of Satan, but also as a result of the powerful forces working from the hands of the Magus of the Satanic Age and those of the Initiates opera ting within the frame-work of the Church of Satan. The Uttering of a Word, whether it is of the first or second kind as explained by Ipsissimus Crowley, cannot take place without the Magical and philosophical trends of the time in which it occurs reaching a juncture at which another door, or \"way out\" must be taught. That has been the case with each of the twelve Magi to date, and will continue as a standing rule: The emergence of a Word takes place at a time of specific need. It is not a thing geared to convenience or comfort. A review of #6N will supply the information necessary to understanding the rise and fall of the C/S unde r the leadership of Magus LaVey and those factors leading up to the Book of Coming Forth by Night. The Magus who Uttered Xeper defines his Word in this way in the analysis and commentary of the Book of Coming Forth by Night: Summarily the Word Xeper refers to the tran sformation and evolution of the Will from a human to a divine state of being, by delib erate, conscious, indi vidual force of mind. Written in the Year XI, that description continues to be one of the best basic and concise definitions available. It is possible to explor e the facets and implications of the Word in far greater depth and verbal detail than the above quote, but the brevit y of it bears the core meaning within a sentence, and should not be overlooked simply because it runs to twenty- nine words. The question of what lengths Xeper can be taken to is at this point unaswerable. [It has taken me to a Word of my own, an e xperience I never thought to undergo.] It is an open question primarily because of two factors. First, it is asked by Setians operating within the structure of the Aeon of Set, and is theref ore impossible to place in total perspective as a complete event. Secondly, it is uti lized correctly as a personal t ool, and as such is subject to personal analysis and interpretation. It is then true to say that each Initiate will apply it differently. In the light of the freedoms brought about by Thelema, there can be no right or wrong way of Xepering, since it is up to the individual what he will Remanifest as he Indulges or indulges in the pursu it of Xeper. In the cases which have made more or less forced exits due to the nature of their bei ngs, the reasons are most generally those of destructively disruptive behavior s which are out of line with what is considered to be transformation upward on the ladder. There is absolutely nothing wrong with misusing the facilities of the mind, but it must be done outside the gates of the Temple of Set. No Word is without signifi cance for the Initiate who aspi res to greater heights of understanding. The seven prominent ones -- Agape, Restriction, Thelema, Indulgence, Xeper, Xem, and Remanifestation -- continue to have visible impact regard less of the time spans between the current moment and their Utterances ; each also can and should be taken into account as having viable influences in the cour se of personal evolution. The focus of this article is the Word of the tenth Magus, and it is in that direc tion we now turn our attention."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"The definition of Xeper on the previous page is a most concise and to the point one. What it does not cover is the almost infi nite number of nuances brought about by the Word itself. The author of the explanation can do no more than work toward clarity th rough description; he cannot force the principle, lest he undermine th e freedom inherent in the Word and sacrifice his own independence by thrusting himself into a sa vior role in the proces s. The tactical errors of Jesus are prime examples of what can happe n when more recognition is given to the man instead of his Word. Being in the spotlight for the sake of personal satisfaction is all well and fine if that is the individual's wish, but ego- gratification can turn into disaster for those charged with teaching new truths. Xeper is also translated as Becoming, Coming into Being. Know ing that, Initiates are faced with the question of what they will Become th rough initiation, itself a process designed to bring about transformation. The hand of Set will have a great deal to do with the heights to which that conversion can attain; e.g. an as piring First Degree will achieve Black Magical mastery as an Adept in the arts and never ente r the Priestly realm w ithout ordination by Set regardless of his proficiency, just as the Priest will remain with the knowledge of his Degree unless his Work is sanctioned as Magisterial by the Prince. There are of course a world of subcategories in this line of thought, because of the combined efforts of both Initiates and Set working at times simultaneously to effect cha nges necessary within th e current of the Aeon and the Temple. It is beyond the scope of this paper to cover them in detail. The prerogative to ordain is Set's, and it is not a thing to be worked toward; ra ther, one should work for work's sake, making the personal priority one of transformation and evolution of the Will instead of the admiration of others -- itse lf breaking down to no more than the dust of earth in the long run. Viewing Xeper as a personal priori ty is indeed the single way in which it can be utilized in the way I personally Understand Set's design in havi ng the Word Uttered in the first place. Like the other Words, it is a tool to be made use of . Like the Black Magic of which Xeper is a part, it can be dangerous beyond imagining if abuse d. It has the power to take man beyond the stars, or to cause him to strike himself dow nward to the depths of despair and madness. Which path it will take depends on no one other than the Initiate himself. Should he continue striving ceaselessly he will find wonders; if he balks his reward is watching stasis create a malignancy which we have seen arise over the years. Xeper does not indicate effortless active involve ment. The resistance of the cosmos works constantly to reduce all to the level of th e lowest common denominator, and by definition Xeper operates on any stratum but that. The infl ux of stimuli and situations encountered demands alert awareness in order to be interpreted in its correct perspective. As a result, the actions of those pursuing Xeper are marked by a gr eat deal of insight an d originality -- it is the hallmark of a separate and individual bei ng. The passage in the Book of Coming Forth by Night referring to the text of another being an affront to the Self poi nts to the essence and importance of distinct presence of being. The Word further presents a challenge in that it opens the door to a freedom unequalled in sophistication by the previous Aeonic points of change. Initiates are given the opportunity of evolving to a divine stat e of belng through a total freedom wh ich allows him to form the path his Star will take, as the Thel emite might put it.

I punish the enemies who are in it, placed in the Place of Destructlon. I deliver them to the examiners from whose guard there is no escape.\" The subject of the examiners is covered in the analysis and commentary on the Book of Coming Forth by Night , and need not be gone into in hi storical detail here. A number of conjectures regarding the examiners have come about over the years. Beyond the formation or intervention of outside enti ties, there is one trend of t hought dealing with the examiners which deserves some reflection. Circa XVI the concept of the higher self as the personal examiner began to be known, and personally I thi nk it one that may have more than a grain of truth in it. As the being progresses in skill a nd understanding, he grows in self-awareness, thereby developing a set of scales upon whic h he weighs all things encountered, most certainly himself included. The concept of a co nscience approaches in nuance the examiner, but by no means covers it completely. Once awakened the examiner within is ever presen t. It is a judge which functions by virtue of what it perceives as truth, or M aat, as the principle was distinguished in ancient Khem. There is an acute personal truth, that of Being, as the RKB era put it, and there is a basis of accuracy in it since each each Initiate is expected to have not only a continuous awareness of his actions and their etiologies, but also a good idea of the reality of his current status. It is the internal examiner which assists in nudging and giving incentive to further acts along the Path. It acts also in this dual capaci ty: the Initlate is stimulated eith er to gather more knowledge and comprehension to itself, or it creates the desire to depart from the source of the urge to act as far as is possible. Since the Black Flame is a gift from Set residing in each mind regardless of Temple affiliation, escape is not possible except by refuge in the realm of self-deception. It is not a pretty thought, but noneth eless a demonstrable one. With all the positive aspects of Xeper, it would seem that there would be far fewer Initiates departing the Temple's environs. There are t hose who depart with goodwill on both sides, and to those we wish nothing but the best. Such exits usually take place at the First and second Degree levels, and these we can understand as hazards more or less normal along the way. These departures on the Third De gree plus level are a bit mere unexpected and difficult to take when they do occur. The general reason unde rlying all stated ones is simple -- there has been a loss of touch with the re ality of the Temple's principles . The greatest of these is the bank of truths and treasures inherent in the Wo rd of which my own is a more recently exposed facet. The Word of the Aeon of Set is Xeper -- Become.

The time of the Purification is past. The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance, and I shall not recant my Word, spoken to my High Priest MehenPetTha in old Khem and now again to you. Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, and va nquish thus the feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my true Word and now are an affront to me. I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe. I created HarWer that I might define my Self. All other gods of all other times and nations have been created by men. This you know from the first Part of my Word, and from my manifest semblance, which alone is not of Earth. Known as the Hebrew Satan, I chose to bring fo rth a Magus, according to the fashion of my Word. He was charged to form a Church of Sa tan, that I might easily touch the minds of men in this image they had cast for me. In the fifth year of the Church of Satan, I gave to this Magus my Diabolicon , that he might know the truth of my ancient Gift to mankind, cl othed though it might be in the myths of the Hebrews. Even you, who delivered the Diabolicon from Asia, did not know it for what it was. But he that I had fashioned a Magus knew, and he thought often of the Diabolicon as he guided the Church of Satan. Upon the ninth Solstice, theref ore, I destroyed my pact w ith Anton Szandor LaVey, and I raised him to the Will of a Daimon, unbounded by the material dimensions. And so I thought to honor him beyond other men. But it may have been this act of mine that ordained his fall. Were I my Self to displace the Cosmic Inertia, I should be forced to become a new measure of consistency. I would cease to be One, for I should become All. To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to br eak his Self-reference to the bounds in which his semblance must exist. I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore to An ton Szandor LaVey his human aspect and his degree of Magus in my Orde r. Thus all may understand that he is dearly held by me, and that the end of the Church of Sa tan is not a thing of shame to him. But a new Aeon is now to begin, and the work of Anton S zandor LaVey is done. Let him be at ease, for no other man has ever seen with his eyes. 1 Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":" In April of the common year 1904, I came forth in Africa as my Opposite Self and brought into being an Aeon to end the horrors of the stasis of the death-gods of men. This new Aeon was a Purification, to prepare men for that which would follow it. And Aleister Crowley received the Book of the Law , and my Opposite Self declared him Magus of the Aeon. But HarWer, my Opposite Self, is a strange and f itful presence. I, Set, am my Self distinct from the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordered in and of my Self. Ha rWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and could achieve id entity only by becoming what the Cosmic order was not. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a Void in which true creation could take form as Set. But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the Cosm ic inertia without having to assume its place. And so HarWer must exist while Set exists. The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equinox of the common year 1966, when HarWer and Set were fused in one composite being. And so commenced the time of Set-HarWer -- known as the Age of Satan -- which was to bridge th e expiring Aeon of HarWer and the forthcoming Aeon of Set. Truth there was in the words of my Opposite Self, but a truth ever tinged with the inconsistency and irrationality of which I have spoken. And so the Book of the Law was confusion to all who came upon it, and the creat ive brilliance of the Ma gus Aleister Crowley was ever flawed by mindless destructiveness. He himself could never understand this, for he perceived HarWer as a unified Self. And so he was perplexed by a mystery he could not identify. And I, Set, spoke too in the Book of the Law – \"Aye! listen to the numbers and the words – \"What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not, nor shalt thou know ever.

Since the ninth of June I had received a series of indications that the overall situation and my own actions therein were not haphazard. [Consultation of the Book of Thoth on Friday, June thirteenth , for example, yielded the following sequence: 2 of Cups/7 of Disks/9 of Disks/2 of Wands/The Devil.] But I had not received what I considered to be a conclusive answer to the meaning of these events. Because of the strength intrinsic in the Church of Satan, it seemed illogical to me that it could cease to exist so suddenly. The actions of An ton Szandor LaVey, a Magus V, also seemed oddly out of character to the poi nt of incomplete inconsistency.

Aquino The Book of Coming Forth by Night: Analysis and Commentary Introduction From 1966 to 1975 CE there existed in the Un ited States of Amer ica a most singular organization known as the Church of Satan. F ounded by Anton Szandor LaVey in the city of San Francisco, it espoused the social doctrin e of \"Indulgence\", challenging all creeds, cultures, and codes that seek virtue through abstin ence from the pleasures of mortal existence. In its formative years the Church of Satan t ook a dual approach towards the being from whom it took its name – passionately literal in ritu al magic, defensively metaphorical in public discussion. In this latter cont ext \"Satan\" was a term represen ting simply the principle of carnality. Thus the Church's rituals and cerem onies could be excused as illustrative, inspirational, and allegorical psychodramas. That, at least, is the way it all began. \"When he is called,\" Eliphas Levi once observed, \"the Devil comes and is seen.\" And in that prosaic statement lies a truth w hose implications challenge the ra tional constructs of the most exacting intellects. The one commo n feature to all the gods of a ll the nations of history, it may be said, is that they do no t come and are not seen. Classification: V2 - A17.121 - 3 Author: Michael A.

The full history of the Church of Satan is documented in my Church of Satan . Where the Church as a functioning institut ion is concerned, its history e nded on the North Solstice of the Satanic Year Ten, the evening of June 21-22, 197 5. For the Church had fa llen in ruins, Anton LaVey having corrupted the Priesthood; and it se emed to me, at that time Magister Templi IV° and successor by default to the Satanic High Priesthood, that only direct intervention by the Prince of Darkness himself could pr ovide us with a basis for a viable raison d'être . Alone that night I called upon him, and he cam e forth -- through a seque nce of realizations within my mind that, in a few short hours, I r ecorded in written text as The Book of Coming Forth by Night. In its most immediate sense this text brought the Church of Satan to a final, dignified terminus, superseding it with a new initiatory in stitution -- the Temple of Set -- whose history to date may be found in its various admi nistrative papers, newsletters, and the Jeweled Tablets of Set . Yet the Book of Coming Forth by Night was to prove a far deep er and richer mine, as again and again I strove to explore its depths. My fi rst comment – a single page 1 – was written on the morning of June 23, X. My next – ten pages – was sent to the Priesthood of Set on September 6, X. The third – sixty-four pages – was prepared as The Book of Coming Forth by Night: Analysis & Commentary by May 26, XI. Since then the Temple of Set has attained a far richer awareness of its identity. I myself grew to comprehend the full meaning of the Word wh ereby I came into being as a Magus V°. In doing so I aided others to attune their magical Wills to ever more powerful sources of energy and inspiration that had lain dormant within them. Having fulfilled that which was set forth for me to do upon the Earth as a Magus, I myse lf came into being on th e Ides of March XIV as an Ipsissimus VI°. This, then, is an examination of the Book of Coming Forth by Night from a VI° perspective, encompassing the key magical texts of tw o Æons and their intervening Age. The Book of Coming Forth by Night is no longer just a call to arms a nd a charge to the fellowship of the Prince of Darkness; it is a prin ciple which has woven itself into the fabric of existence so thoroughly that it has become an immortal el ement of mankind's higher potential. It remains for those who seek the path to that towards which it shows the way to train themselves and refine their states of being until this Graal a ppears in its truth before them. This commentary is a foretaste of the elixir of the Graal; it is to say that Xeper is no mere chimaera – it comes and is seen. The particulars surrounding the creation of the Book of Coming Forth by Night will become evident through comments addressing its passages. Herein I will recount the events leading up to that creation, facts and impressions con cerning the text itself, and the sequence of developments which followed. To what extent does the text le nd itself to a final interpretation? At first reading it is both straightforward and unambiguous. Many of the words and phrases, however, are evidently used in an emphatically precise sense. A magi cian and a philosopher will examine them with"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"corresponding care. Moreover the Book of Coming Forth by Night is not simply a compendium of abstract generalizations; its ap pearance was keyed to specific circumstances, and many of its passages address them. Thus background information is important, particularly for those unfamiliar with th e events and subjects in question. While the Book of Coming Forth by Night is sufficiently integral to be read and considered as a whole, its statements are best treated in sequence. Hence I be gin as the text itself began: with its name. Xeper . Ra-en-Set The Book of Coming Forth by Night (title) In hieroglyphics this would be Sat Per Em Kerh . It is an evident contra st to the name of the Book of Coming Forth by Day , the Osirian funerary text that is popularly known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead . The Osirian cult in particular glorified life-aft er-death above life- before-death. The Book of Coming Forth by Day is essentially a selection of spells and incantations designed to aid a newly-dead pers on through the perils of the underworld. This preoccupation with death is c onspicuously absent from the Book of Coming Forth by Night , which is ultimately an appeal and a challe nge for the enhancement of conscious life. North Solstice The Book of Coming Forth by Night was written during the night of the North Solstice (June 21-22) 1975 (the year X of the Ag e of Satan, according to the Chur ch of Satan). Here the year is given the hieroglyphic name Xeper , symbolized by Xepera , the scarab beetle who represents the principle of the Sun's \"immort ality\" via its transition through the darkness towards another dawn. The Equinox has succumbed to my Solstice, and I, Set, am revealed in my Majesty. The apparent reference is to the North Solstic e, as explained above. There may be a second implication: Aleister Crowley identified the events surrounding the in ception of the Æon of Horus in 1904 CE as the \"Equinox of the Gods.\" The Book of Coming Forth by Night heralds the eclipse of that aeon in favor of the Æon of Set. My evocation -- an effort to interpret the surp rising downfall of the Church of Satan -- was addressed to \"Satan\" (which I believed the proper name of the Prince of Darkness). Immediately, however, he corrects this name to that of Set. The term \"Majesty\" is also significant; in Egypt this honorific title wa s accorded only two gods -- Set and Ra. In hieroglyphics it is the suffix -hen . The linguistic origin of the Hebrew term \"Satan\" is thus exposed. The time of the Purification is past."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"This period is not conclusively identified. It may refer to the Age of Satan (Set/ HarWer), when all of the Osirian death-worship and pos thumous salvation cults experienced a more-or- less final exposure and discrediting. Or it may refer to the Æon of Horus (HarWer), during which time the grip of the old cults on th e human mind was gradually broken. Or it may indicate the entire passage of time since the Osirian death-worship cult gained supremacy in Egypt and either absorbed or out lawed the life-oriented cults. The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance, and I shall not recant my Word, spoken to my High Priest MehenPetTha in old Khem and now again to you. The emphasized term \"Gift\" refers to the non-natural expansion of human intellectual capacity that occurred in prehistoric times. 2 \"Word\" refers to the Word of Set , discussed below. There are no records of the ancient Priesthood of Set through which \"High Priest MehenPetTha\" might be identified, but the name can be rendered in hieroglyphics. \"Khem\" is a phonetic version of the hieroglyphic Xem , one of the many titles of the ancient Egyptian nation. Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, a nd vanquish thus the feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my true Word and now are an affront to me. On April 13, 1584 CE John Dee, mathematician and magician to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, undertook a series of Workings in Cracow, Poland. With the assistance of Edward Kelley, he wrote into his diaries a seri es of nineteen magical incanta tions in what he called the \"Enochian or Angelic language.\" With each in cantation or Key Dee provided an English translation, also communicated by the angels to Kelley. In 1659 the Dee diaries containing the Keys were published by Meric. Casaubon as A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeers between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits . 3 The attribution of the Keys or language to Enoch is interesting insofar as he is a remarkable individual in legend. Described in the Old Testament as the seve nth master of the world after Adam, Enoch is the Hebrew equivalent of the Phoenician Cadmus, the Greek Hermes, and the Egyptian Thoth. As such he is the repute d author of the Tarot, the Cabala, the Emerald Tablet of Thoth , and the apocryphal Book of Enoch . He receives only a brief mention in \"Genesis\", where the fifth chapter recounts: \"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and be gat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five y ears: And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\" The Book of Enoch comprises a part of what is genera lly called Apocalyptic literature. The Apocalyptists were a school of pre-Rabbinical Hebrews who be lieved that the world was in such catastrophic condition as to be incurable by any of man's efforts. The name \"Apocalyptist\" means \"revealer\", and this sect maintained that human progress was rigidly mapped by God and was not subject to human will at all. In this the Apocalyptists differed from the other major Hebraic branch, Pharisaism. The Apocalyptic literature is generally fixed to the period 200-150 BCE, and the Book of Enoch is generally regarded as the oldest such work. It seems to have been written by a number of authors, the earliest being a Hebrew from the Land of Dan in northern Palestine."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The original text was probably written in Hebrew or Aramaic, later translated into Greek and Latin. These translations did not directly surv ive the decline of the Holy Roman Empire. The Greek version had been translated into Ethi opian, however, and an explorer named Bruce brought back a copy of it from Abyssinia in 1773 CE. The Book of Enoch is sometimes referred to as I Enoch to distinguish it from II Enoch (or The Secrets of Enoch ), a later work executed in Slavonic. The Book of Enoch contains six sections: The Book of Enoch, the Parables, the Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries, the Dream-Visions, the Conclu sion, and the Noah Fragments. Most are restatements of traditional Hebraic doctrine , but the first section -- the Book of Enoch -- includes accounts of Enoch's visits to certain areas of Earth and Sheol, including the following descriptions of the Pala ce of the Prince of Darkness: \"And I went in until I drew nigh to a wall whic h is built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire, and it began to affri ght me. And I went into the tongue s of fire and drew nigh to a large house which was built of crystals. The walls of the house were like a tesselated floor of crystals, and its groundwork was of crystal. Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and the lightnings, and between them were fiery Cher ubim amidst a background of water. A blazing fire surrounded the walls, and its portals were co vered with fire. And I entered into that house, and it was as hot as fire yet as cold as ice. There were no delights of life therein. Fear covered me, and trembling gat hold of me. And I qua ked and trembled and fell down upon my face.\" Shortly thereafter Enoch be holds the Black Flame: \"From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the Earth. And I saw a burning fire which ran without resting, and paused not fr om its course day or ni ght but blazed without respite. And I asked, saying, 'What is this flame which burns unceasingly?' Then Raguel, one of the holy Angels who was with me, said, 'This is the Dark Fire in the West which persecutes all the luminaries of Heaven.'\" In the \"Conclusion\" the coming of a new kingdom is predicted -- not in an afterlife, but here on Earth. The destructio n of the existing Earth and Heaven is foretold, followed by the institution of a \"new Heaven.\" The relevance of this Book of Enoch material to the deciphered \"Enochian Keys\" will become apparent. In the late nineteenth century the Casaubon text of the Enochian Keys was adopted into the magical inventory of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a London-based Rosicrucian society. The Golden Dawn altered and augmented the Keys in order to align them with its own emphasis on the Hebrew Cabala, and its public ations assert a mastery of the Enochian language by the leaders of the Order. 4 Aleister Crowley later inco rporated the Golden Dawn edition of the Keys into his AA, again claimi ng fluency in Enochian and constructing rituals from Enochian words and phrases. 5 The Keys next appeared in 1969 CE, when An ton LaVey took the Cabalistic version from Crowley's Equinox, replaced references to the Juda ic/Christian God with references to Satan, and included the result in his Satanic Bible . 6 The general sensation caused by this book, together with a considerable amount of i ndignation on the part of old-line Cabalists, eventually inspired a revi val of interest in John D ee and his magical diaries. 7 In 1974 CE Stephen Skinner brought out a s econd (facsimile) edition of A True and Faithful Relation , a copy of which I acquired in March of the following year."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Upon comparing the facsimile Casaubon to the Golden Dawn, Crowley, and LaVey Keys, I realized the extent of the di stortion that had taken place. Be ing familiar with language and cipher construction, I set out to unr avel the original Keys to dete rmine their linguistic lineage. After some weeks of work, I conc luded that Enochian is not a true language. Rather it is an artificial jargon, i.e.: arbitrar y words placed together in roughly consistent sequences to simulate a true language. It is so cleverly done that it can fool non-li nguists fairly easily. 8 It is even possible to \"write\" in Enochian as Crow ley did, altering suffixes to create the impression of declension or conjugation. But a comprehensiv e grammar, essential to a true written or spoken tongue, is lacking. 9 Once I realized Enochian to be a jargon, I ch anged my approach. Now I suspected that it might be some sort of cipher or code, Dee being famous for his use of same. I tested the first three Keys against a variety of code-breaking techniques. Once more I met with no success. I had not held high hopes that I w ould. The loose alignment of E nochian words to their English counterparts, together with an entirely differe nt frequency of indivi dual letters in the two languages [even cancelling out the most divergen t letters], makes cipher improbable. Only pure code -- with Enochian words or letters m eaning something not revealed by their internal design alone -- remained. To uncover such a code , one would simply have to know the words or phrases in English triggered by a given E nochian word or phrase, unrelated though the connection might otherwise be. [For example, the otherwise random appearance of \"vorsg\" might be code for \"for the Queen's eyes only\", etc.] Two avenues of investigation remained. First, if it were true that Enochian were neither language nor cipher, then there was still the possibility that it might be a corruption of a genuine tongue. Regardie [citing Mathers' me thod], Crowley, and LaVey had all accepted Kelley's comment that \"He seemeth to read as Hebrew is read.\" 10 I decided to eliminate this Hebrew-letter pronunciation en tirely, treating each word as a phonetic unity and deemphasizing the vowels. [Thus \"vorsg\" should be pronounced just that way, rather than \"vaoresaji\".] My test case was the XIX Key, 30th Æthyr (T EX) on the assumption that there might be visual results per Crow ley's experiences in The Vision and The Voice . 11 This time there was a certain success, in that I experienced a sequence of unusual visions and dreams. 12 Finally, during the evening of May 30, I experimented with the XVII Key and was rewarded with spectacular results -- the \"S phinx and Chimaera\" Working. 13 Then, in the first week of June, something quite unexpected happened. I began to write a text in installments of one or two hours per ni ght. In the same style as the future Book of Coming Forth by Night , it declared the Enochian Keys to be a remote corruption of something called the Word of Set . There followed two \"pure\" Keys in English – called \"parts\" of the Word of Set . Before proceeding further I was forced to break my concentration because of the sudden crisis in the Church of Satan, and so the Word of Set remained unfinished for the next six years. As to the \"breaking\" of the Keys \"by the doctrin es of Anton LaVey\", therein lies still another tale. Anton's principal contributi on to the Crowley Keys was to render them in what might be called a \"Black Mass\" form, with Heavenly refe rences arbitrarily changed to Infernal ones. One might presume that this would invalidat e the statements of the text. Oddly enough, however, the use of these \"Black Keys\" by the C hurch of Satan produced magical results that were, if anything, far more powerful than those of the \"pure\" system. In my Working on the"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Word of Set , I used an approach similar to Anton's, seeking words to express what I seemed to sense the Keys were actually in tended to say. In short I was e ndeavoring to present the Keys in a still \"Blacker\" version th an that which appears in the Satanic Bible . Moreover the North Solstice X Working which resulted in the Book of Coming Forth by Night was begun with this new First Part of the Word of Set rather than with the First Enochian Key. Such would seem to be the basis for the Book of Coming Forth by Night's reference to the \"br eaking\" of the old Keys. Six years later the Working of the Word of Set was finally completed -- on April 13, XVI (anniversary of John Dee's initial Working). In the Satanic Bible the Enochian Keys, even in their altered form, are still garbled and unintelligible. Hence Anton felt the need to venture an interpretation of each one preceding its text. These interpretations have no basis in previous documents, and indeed previous commentators -- including Dee himself -- had be en unable to integrate the Keys into a coherent translation. After completing the Working of the Word of Set , I found that the new translation needed no external interpretation -- at least not for thos e to whom it was evidently addressed. Obviously it is idiomatic and not a word-for-word transla tion -- as are all translations from original hieroglyphs. In XV, furthermore, I learned that the Casa ubon account of the Dee Keys was not as error- free as I had previously supposed. My benefactor was an Initiate of the Temple of Set who kindly provided me with a complete microfilm of the original Dee diary Keys from the British Museum. Hence the \"Enochian\" text reproduced with the Word of Set is an exact copy of the original as John Dee penned it, including capitalization. As I ha ve noted above, this original does not lend itself to grammatically-based tran slation or to word-fo r-word correlation with Dee's own English \"translation\". [The most r ecent efforts to do so -- in Donald Laycock's Enochian Dictionary – resulted in an arbitrary subdivid ing of the Enochian text and the addition of a modern-English-based punctuation in order to \"force\" a co rrelation. The quality of the result is self-evident.] An \"Enochian purist\" might questio n the translation provided by the Word of Set in that it is not the English version recorded by John Dee in his diaries. My answer is simply that I approached the Keys not as a historian seeking to reprint what Dee did, but as a magician seeking to operate the same \"magical machinery\" that Dee did -- and to operate it with greater care and precision than he did. Hence it is not a case of my \"corrupting De e\", but rather of my uncorrupting something which predated Dee's own existe nce, and which was, after all, not of his [or Kelley's] authorship. Were one to take the position that the Keys are a Dee/Kelley creation, then they would be fraudulent as a GBM Working -- and merely an uncommonly- successful LBM stunt which has mystified and obsessed occultists these many centuries. As it appears here, then, the Word of Set is an eighteenfold sequence of statements addressed to the original (\"third ordering\") Initiates of the Temple of Set in ancient times. The 19th Part is not so much a statement as an operative invocation to be used for access to what Dee referred to as the \"thirty aires or aethyrs.\" Use of this invocation is best described in Crowley's Liber LXXXIX vel Chanokh ; see also The Vision and The Voice . What exactly is an \"aethyr\"? Cabalistically th ese are \"rings\" or \"sphe res\" [of consciousness] progressively closer to the uni versal godhead. Per Crowley, each aethyr also awakens certain kinds of dispositions and perceptions in a magician who focuses his attention towards it -- and"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"may also provide him with access to related ma gical tools and/or weapons. The aethyrs will stand further exploration, in light of the Initia tory advances of the Æon of Set, and should provide a rich opportunity for Setians to test their GBM sensitivity and skills. I am the ageless Intelligence of this Univers e. I created HarWer that I might define my Self. All other gods of all other times and na tions have been created by men. This you know from the first Part of my Word, and fr om my manifest semblance, which alone is not of Earth. The Universe as a whole is mechanically consistent, but it does not possess a \"God\" personality that favors one of its components -- such as mankind -- above others. The Set- entity, however, is a finite intelligence within the Universe and can draw such distinctions. Set is a being operating independently of the order of the objective universe, not in enforced or unconscious concert with it. According to the Book of Coming Forth by Night , the dual Set/HarWer entity is the only \"god\" that possesses intelligence independent of the objective universe. The Universe as a whole is not intelligent, if a requirement of \"intelligence\" is an active, distinct personality; there is nothing for the Universe as a whole to act upon or be distinct ag ainst. [This principle refutes the doctrine of \"deism\", in which God is assumed to be identical with the totality of existence.] The only quality common to the entire objective universe as such is internal consistency [which is not to sa y that such consistency is a s imple thing to incorporate]. And other gods, whether Egyptian or foreign, are de rivative of Set or of the human mind. This does not imply that they are \"imaginary\" in the vulgar sense [except when crudely conceptualized by vulgar imaginations]. The di sciplined, educated, and experienced mind is capable of substantive creation; it can give life to stereotypical, archet ypical, and/or unique gods and daemons. This creative ability distingui shes the magician from the superstitious believer: The former conceives and actualizes such entities consci ously and deliberately, while the latter is controlled and conditione d by externally imposed images of them. Known as the Hebrew Satan, I chose to bring forth a Magus, according to the fashion of my Word. He was charged to form a Church of Satan, that I might easily touch the minds of men in this image they had cast for me. The Hebrew term \"Satan\" is a corruption of the hieroglyphic Set-hen , 14 just as the Hebrew \"YahWeh\" and its derivative Christian trinity are corruptions of the earlier Osirian cult. 15 By the end of the XXV Dynasty the Priesthood of Set in Egypt was probably destroyed, 16 and the subsequent loss of the hieroglyphic language virt ually eliminated the or iginal Set from human knowledge. Only the Osirian corruption survived in legend -- principa lly through Plutarch, who described it in some detail in his Moralia . 17 The archetypical daemon most closely akin to Set was the Christian Satan, particul arly in his Miltonian representation. 18 Set accordingly chose this image as the one most mean ingful for post-Egyptian manifestations. 19 The term \"Magus\" is used in the specialized sense of Western initiat ory tradition. A Magus is characterized by his identification, comp rehension, and introduction of a new magical/philosophical principle -- a process de scribed as the Utteran ce of a Word and/or Formula. 20 Like a prophet he accomplishes this through a mental \"link\" with a higher intellectual essence (what Plato termed Noesis ). Such a \"link\" may be either external (with a separate intelligence) or internal (with the highe r sensitivity of one's own intelligence). In either case it is the manifest results of the experience that are significant."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Unlike a prophet, a Magus establishes such a \" link\" through deliberate mental focus, and with full comprehension of the result. Hence an essential distincti on between magic and [conventional] religion is that philosophical discip line is required for the former, while mental relaxation and abandonment of critical facul ties (=faith) are required for the latter. 21 In 1966 CE (the year I Anno Satani) Anton S zandor LaVey assumed the title of Magus V° and founded the Church of Satan in San Franci sco. For its first three years, the Church remained primarily a local institution. In 1969 it began to accept memberships from other areas. By 1971 it developed a nationwide Priesthood and administrative structure. 22 In the fifth year of the Chu rch of Satan, I gave to this Magus my Diabolicon, that he might know the truth of my an cient Gift to mankind, clothed though it might be in the myths of the Hebrews. Even you, who delivered the Diabolicon from Asia, did not know it for what it was. But he that I had fashioned a Magus knew, and he thought often of the Diabolicon as he guided the Church of Satan. In January-March of the year V, I was a Satanist I of the Church of Satan. I was also a First Lieutenant in the Army, stationed in Lai Khe/ Ben Cat, South Vietnam. Wishing to make a contribution to the lore of the Church, I decided to write a restatement of certain themes from John Milton's Paradise Lost . But what flowed from my pen began to assume a dignity beyond what I had anticipated. Unlike the later Book of Coming Forth by Night , it was not written in final draft in one sitting; rather the entire proj ect occupied the better pa rt of three months. I revised the Diabolicon extensively until I thought it \"sounded right\", and then I recopied the final text in calligraphic letters because ordinary handwriting or typed copy seemed inappropriate. The final document was sent to An ton LaVey in April of V. His response came soon thereafter: \"I received the Diabolicon safely. It is indeed a work whic h will have a lasting impact. It is done in an ageless manner and with complete awareness. So impressed am I that I have selected passages from it for my own persona l reading in this evening's ceremony, which pays homage to the writings of the Satanic Masters of the past, such as Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Twain, Hobbes, etc. ... You have my sincere gratitude for the fine gift you have so graciously bestowed upon us, and you may be assured that it will assume a meaningful place in the Order.\" 23 The Diabolicon was retained unreleased in San Franci sco. Although I subsequently circulated a few typed copies among the Priesthood, the Diabolicon was not made generally available until the publication of the first edition of this Analysis & Commentary in XI/1976. Upon the ninth Solstice, therefore, I destr oyed my pact with Anton Szandor LaVey, and I raised him to the Will of a Daimon, unboun ded by the material dimensions. And so I thought to honor him beyond other men. But it may have been this act of mine that ordained his fall. For the next four years after the creation of the Diabolicon , I wrote nothing similar to it. In the summer of IX/1974, however, I once more experien ced the restlessness that had characterized the Working of the Diabolicon ; and over a two-month period I penned a similar document containing the message referred to in this passag e -- what was since called the \"Ninth Solstice Message.\" In August I again sent the calli graphic original to Anton LaVey. In an"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"accompanying note I disclaimed the prerogative to comment on it. Anton replied with a note in -- uncharacteristically -- his own handwriting: \"It pleases me that you perceive that wh ich you do. You have entered a new realm of comprehension and truly dese rve the name of Satanist.\" 24 A question remains concerning the pact of Ant on LaVey. I have not seen such a paper, nor have I ever heard him speak of it. \"Pacts with the Devil\" were never considered to be necessary in the Church of Sata n. The contents of this particul ar pact, presuming that it did exist, remain unknown. Were I my Self to displace the Cosmic Inertia, I should be forced to become a new measure of consistency. I would cease to be One, for I should become All. Here Set observes that he, as a finite intelligen ce possessing the prerogativ e to act in disregard of the mechanical norm of the objective universe, cannot complete ly replace or redesign that universe without himself becoming identical wi th it, i.e.: infinite, omnipresent, hence mechanical [from the point of view of any co mponent intelligence]. This is a more precise restatement of the famous Miltonian paradox: that a conquered God would become Satan, and a conquering Satan God. 25 To make of man a Daimon, then, may be to break his Self-reference to the bounds in which his semblance must exist. A human who passes beyond the Initiation of Ma gus encounters the same paradox that Set describes above. He ceases to view himself as a finite intelligence working upon an inertial environment. Rather he attains such a strong se nse of harmonious interrelationships that there is a strong tendency to perceive the entire objec tive universe as conforming to his Word as a Magus. Initially this would seem to be immensel y satisfying, but in fact the phenomenon is so instantaneous, automatic, and comprehensive that there is no particular sense of achievement. An individual in such a situa tion is in danger of losing a sense of unique identity, as the barriers between his consciousness and the phenomena of the unive rse become fluid. [It is not inappropriate to compare this experience to that of quantum physicists, who suddenly encounter an objective universe in which all \"cons tants\" are revealed to be \"variables\".] A second consequence of this situation is that a human magician is st ill restricted to his physical body. This requires him to move about an d to participate in th e ordinary society of non-magicians. Skilled magicians learn to do this without inciting fear in or ostracism by non- magicians, but a Daimon may tend to carelessn ess in such mundane matters. Accordingly he runs great danger of becoming a target of th e mob. Socrates and Pythagoras were two who displayed Daimonic detachment. Both were slain for their \"impiety\". In the Church of Satan there was no initiator y degree beyond that of Magus V° (alternately called \"Satanic Master\"). The designation of \"Dai mon\" here may be considered comparable to what the Temple of Set would later Recognize as the VI° of Ip sissimus. The word \"Daimon\" comes from the Greek daimon, meaning \"divine spirit \" or \"tutelary divinit y.\" It is, of course, the term which was later corrupted into th e Christian term \"demon\". The irony is not inappropriate."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore to Anton Szandor LaVey his human aspect and his degree of Magus in my Order. Thus all may understand that he is dearly held by me, and that the end of the Church of Satan is not a thing of shame to him. But a new Aeon is now to begin, a nd the work of Anton Szandor LaVey is done. Let him be at ease, for no other man has ever seen with his eyes. In May of the year X/1975, Anton LaVey announ ced his intention to sell the initiatory degrees of the Church of Satan for \"professional services, funds, real es tate, objects of value, etc.\" It was a decision completely inconsistent with the previous st andards of individual awareness and ability he had maintained, nor would it have achieved its intended result of augmenting his income. It was precisely the non -corruptible nature of the Satanic degrees which had made them so highly prized. Such a startling shortfall of logic by an individual known for his analytical mind was inexplicable. Th e entire Church of Satan was plunged into crisis; organizational resignations poured in; and by the end of June the once-strong national network had virtually ceased to exist. For a decade the Church of Satan had surmounted every obstacle and solved every problem with an ease unequalled and unprecedented in occultism. Now it was dying, not with a bang but with a whimper, This too we could not unde rstand. Hence my decision to appeal directly to Satan on the eve of the North Solstice. In the Book of Coming Forth by Night Set assumes responsibility for the disastrous course of events by citing the unanticipated dangers of th e Daimonic state of mind. He implies that the Age of Satan (Set/HarWer) would have evolved in to the Æon of Set in any case [though this would not necessarily have meant an organizationa l crisis or change in leadership; it was the means, not the end, which proved to be unnecessarily traumatic]. From the manuscript of the Book of Coming Forth by Night I printed and bound thirty copies, which I sent to the high Initiates of the Church of Satan on June 23. Xu thenru ast a ari-f em suten. Middle Egyptian hieroglyphics. Tr anslation: \"He did many glori ous things and mighty deeds as High Priest.\" In April of the common year 1904, I came fort h in Africa as my Opposite Self and brought into being an Aeon to end the horrors of the stasis of the death-gods of men. This new Aeon was a Purification, to prep are men for that which would follow it. On April 8-10 in Cairo in 1904 CE, Aleister Crowley wrote down the Book of the Law , a magical text which announced the end of the Æon of Osiris and the beginning of the Æon of Horus. Crowley [though he did not immediately acknowledge the title] was identified as the Magus of that Æon, and its Word was proclaimed to be Thelema (Greek = Will). 26 Crowley"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"attributed the Book of the Law to Aiwass, an entity identified in the text as \"the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.\" 27 In translation this becomes \"the infa nt Horus\" and refers to [the Greek] Harpokrates, a representation of Ho rus the Younger as an infant. Crowley was not familiar with the distinctions between the original Horus and the later Osirian corruption. His Egyptologi cal orientation appears to ha ve been exclusively Osirian, since his comments concerning various Egyptian gods place them squarely in the Osiris-cult characterizations. He named the magical aeons according to the Os irian triad -- first that of Isis, then that of Osiris, a nd finally that of \"the crowned and conquering child\", Horus the Younger. 28 Closely associated with -- and mentioned in -- the Book of the Law was an Egyptian funerary stele, which Crowley called the \"S tele of Revealing.\" The three figures on this stele, whom Crowley called Nuit, Hadit, and Ra Hoor Khuit, lent their names to the three chapters of the Book of the Law . Nuit he correctly identified as the Egyptian sky goddess. Hadit or Had is not the name of any Egyptian deity ; the winged solar disk in qu estion is identified in the hieroglyphs of the stele as Behut -t (Horus Behdety), a form of Horus the Elder worshipped in the western Nile Delta at Behdet. 29 [The curious term \"Hadit\" is actually Arabic, and means \"a divinely inspired utterance.\"] As for Ra Hoor Khuit, whom Cr owley incorrectly identifies as Horus the Younger, 30 the hieroglyphs on the stele title the figure Ra-Harakhti . Ra-Harakhti (\"Ra-Horus of the Two Horiz ons\") was a form of Horus th e Elder identified with Ra, especially in his aspects of Atum and Xepera . 31 Ra-Harakhti was a rival \"final judgment\" god to Osiris in addition to being a solar deity, which explains his presence on the funerary stel e. He is also noteworthy for having defended Set in the Osirian-mythos trial between Set and Horus the Younger. [At one point in the debate, according to the legend, Ra-Harakhti was insulted and re tired to his house in a huff. The proceedings resumed only after Hathor ha d cheered the grouchy god with a strip-tease. 32 ] The Book of the Law and the \"Stele of Revealing,\" c onsequently, cannot be viewed as documents of the Osiris/Isis/Ho rus the Younger triad or cult. They reflect the more ancient solar/light cults of Ra and Horus the Elder – the \"Opposite Self\" of Set. And Aleister Crowley received th e Book of the Law, and my Opposite Self declared him Magus of the Aeon. Crowley did not acknowledge the title of Magus (9)=[2] (according to the AA system) until 1915-16 CE, although the Book of the Law appears to confirm him thus in 1904. 33 But HarWer, my Opposite Self, is a strange and fitful presence. I, Set, am my Self distinct from the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordered in and of my Self. HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and coul d achieve identity only by becoming what the Cosmic order was not. By HarWer I canc elled the imbalance, leaving a Void in which true creation could take form as Set. Here is recounted the phenomenon of the sepa ration of the Set-entity from the Universal order. It is interesting to compare this st atement with the \"revolt\" of Lucifer and his subsequent metamorphosis into Satan. [See in particular Book I of Milton's Paradise Lost and the Statement of Satan ArchDaimon in the Diabolicon .]"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the Co smic inertia without having to assume its place. And so HarWer must exist while Set exists. Ostensibly this is a restatement of the prev iously-discussed \"Satanic paradox.\" Contained here, however, is the comment that the preservation of the HarWer entity is necessary for the continued existence and independence of the Set-en tity. HarWer thus acts as a sort of \"buffer\" between Set and the Universal law that seeks to include all existential phenomena within itself. 34 This passage may also be considered from the standpoint of physics. If Set is a being that displaces space, then he must consist of matter. Matter may be formed by the application of energy within a zero-mass environment, the re sult being equal quantities of matter and anti- matter. 35 While both the matter unit and the antima tter unit may theoretically be transformed into energy [the E=mc 2 equation], neither can be destroye d unless they are brought together. Should such a reunion occur, th e result would be an explos ion releasing many hundreds of times as much energy as a hydrogen fusion bomb of the same size. The matter and antimatter would return to zero mass, and the energy re quired for the initial separation would be recreated. [In order to appr eciate the amount of energy re quired for the production of matter/antimatter -- and released upon its recomb ination – consider that the production of one proton and one antiproton at Berkeley, Calif ornia in 1955 required 6.2 billion electron volts.] 36 If Set is not matter or antimatter, he may be an energy-form of either. Th is is necessarily pure speculation, because detection of material energy -- let alone distinguishing it from antimaterial energy -- at a great distance is a young science. Such a hypothesis, however, would explain the existence of Set in a form undetected by the human sense-range within the electromagnetic spectrum. The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equinox of the common year 1966, when HarWer and Set were fused in one composite being. And so commenced the time of Set- HarWer -- known as the Age of Satan -- whic h was to bridge the expiring Aeon of HarWer and the forthcoming Aeon of Set. Anton LaVey announced the founding of the Chur ch of Satan on Walpurgisnacht (April 30) 1966 CE, a short time after the Vernal Equinox (approximately March 21). Simultaneously he announced the beginning of what he termed the Age of Satan. In his Satanic Rituals he defines this concept in terms of Hans Hoerbiger's Welteislehre or Doctrine of Eternal Ice, in which the history of the Universe consists of alternating cycl es of fire and ice. 37 The \"Wel\", as it was termed, gained popularity in Nazi Germany because of Adolf Hitler's enthusiasm for Hoerbiger, whom he called the \"German Cope rnicus.\" Anton LaVey, however, offers the theory in a social, not a cosmological context. The key number, he suggests, is nine -- the number of the Devil because it always returns to itself when subjected to basic mathematical calculations. [For example: 9x3=27 and 2+7=9. 9 2 =81 and 8+1=9.] History, says Anton, is divided into \"Epochs\" of 13,122 [adds to 9!] years. Each Epoch is divided into nine \"Ages\" [1,458 y ears: adds to 18 and 1+8=9], and each Age consists of nine \"Eras\" [162 years: adds again to 9]. An Era is divided into nine 18-year \"Workings\". A Working consists of nine years of \"action\" foll owed by nine years of \"reaction\", with the mid- point year being a \"zenith of intensity\" a nd the beginning and endi ng years being \"Working"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Years\". The initial Working Year sees the gene ration of the Working, while the final one is witness to its ultimate product. 38 Whether or not there is any extern al basis for this theory of soci al evolution, the history of the Church of Satan itself has adhe red to it. At the mid-point of the mid-year of the Working begun in mid-1966, the Church went through the cr isis which resulted in its transformation into the Temple of Set. Stric tly speaking, the Temple is not so much a \"reaction\" to the doctrines or design of the Church as it is an \"evolutionary suc cession\" to them. And what of the final Working Year (1983 CE)? At the We welsburg Castle in Westphalia, Germany in October of 1982 was celebrated the Wewelsburg Working, resulting in the reconstitution of the Order of the Trapezoid, a creature of both th e Church of Satan and the Temple of Set. The \"fusing of HarWer and Set as one composite being\" evidently does no t refer to a physical reunion of the two entities, else there would have been some sp ectacular fireworks and neither Set nor HarWer would have survived. Some sort of mental link or unified purpose seems to be implied. The use of the Age of Satan as a \"b ridge\" between the two Æ ons seems appropriate. During the Æon of Horus there was a revival of various forms of primeval life-worship, as well as a reaction against the death-worship mono theist cults. During the Age of Satan this \"purge\" reached a climax, with all external gods being deni ed and man as \"just another animal\" being deified. 39 Only in an atmosphere free fr om subconscious mental programming could the Temple of Set be reestablished in an authentic form, uncorrupted by the Osirian distortions. Again Set pointedly uses the phrase \"common year\" when referring to the Christian (\"Anno Domini\") dating system; his repugnance is evident. Truth there was in the words of my Opposi te Self, but a truth ever tinged with the inconsistency and irrationality of which I h ave spoken. And so the Book of the Law was confusion to all who came upon it, and th e creative brilliance of the Magus Aleister Crowley was ever flawed by mindless dest ructiveness. He himself could never understand this, for he perceived HarWer as a uni fied Self. And so he was perplexed by a mystery he could not identify. HarWer, as an entity possessing characteristic s of both the non-conscious universe and the independently-conscious Set, is ne cessarily inconsistent and irrational from the perspective of either Set or the objective universe. HarWer is not a true synthesis in the Hegelian sense. Rather he is the antithesis that enables Set to emerge -- not as a synthesi s, but as an entirely distinct and separate being. [Thi s is a restatement and refinement of the sequence cited in the Diabolicon .] The Book of the Law is extremely emotional, internally inconsistent, rambling, and in general quite confusing to those who have read it. Nonetheless it conveys an atmosphere of authenticity [or at least the glamor of myst ery]. Why would a god make such mistakes and present such a profile? The com position of HarWer explains this. The Great Horus is not a foolish or childish neter, but rather one who is caught between the Scylla of Set and the Charybdis of the objective unive rse: perpetually attracted to and rejecting of both. Crowley's disciples have debated the Book of the Law vigorously for the years of its existence, and no two of them have been able to reach a consensus upon it. Crowley himself remained at odds with the text, speculating upon it for the rest of his life. As for hi s \"creative brilliance\""},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"and \"mindless destructiveness\", no one familiar with the writings and career of Aleister Crowley will deny either quality. Indeed he acknowledged both of them in his own diaries and publications, yet without resolv ing to address [or even to fa ult] his negative qualities. Had he succeeded in overcoming them, he could well have been a respected, rather than an infamous figure in his own time. Ironically it is Crowley's notoriety that has accounted for much of his posthumous popularity. [Then there is the question whether a \"reformed\" Aleister Crowley would have remained \"the\" Aleister Crowley. Perhaps not. His split personality was essential to his function as Magus of the Æon of Horus, per the constitution of Horus himself.] Crowley's \"perception of HarWer as a unified Self \" presumably refers to his ignorance of the distinction between the origin al Horus and the later Osirian corruption. The Osirian Horus was a unified personality (Osiris' son) who fought Set (recast as Osiris' evil brother). 40 Horus the Elder was complementary to Set, not antagon istic towards him, and so these two original gods were often shown with a single body. 41 The god identified by Crowley as Horus the Younger was in fact Horus the Elder. This acc ounts for the \"surprising\" inconsistency of Crowley's patron, as well as Crowley's oft-e xpressed bewilderment at such behavior. Inclusion here of the word \"perplexed\" may be significant in a partic ularly poignant sense. According to The Great Beast , the definitive biography of Crowley by John Symonds, the aging Ipsissimus spent his last years in near-pov erty, sick from heroin addiction and visited only infrequently by friends. He fo ught death, tears in his eyes as he sank into his final coma; and his last words were \"I am perplexed ...\" 42 And I, Set, spoke too in the Book of th e Law -- \"Aye! listen to the numbers and the words \"What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou know est not, nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it.\" These are verses #75 and #76 from the second chapter of the Book of the Law . The strange handwriting is that of Aleister Crowley, from his original ma nuscript of the document. Verse #47 of the third chapter states: \"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with th e original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and in their position to one another: in these are mysteries no Beast shall divine. Let him not s eek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all.\" Significantly, all printed texts of the Book of the Law show \"24\" and \"89\" without the top and bottom lines that suggest their sum as integers. Only the Crowley handwriting indicates this. Verse #47 continues:"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"\"Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also.\" 43 Again the figures are shown only on the ha ndwritten manuscript. The line in question progresses through squares of a grid. The \"failing ci rcle\" is located in one of the squares. If \"each number becomes the corresponding letter\", then the sum of the multiplied coordinates of the line [3+6+9+16+20+30+35=119] less the multip lied coordinate of the \"failing circle\" [28] = 91 = 10 or X, the year in which the Æ on of Set was manifest and the Temple of Set revived. Crowley, in defiance of #III-47, believed the \"one\" to be Charles Stansfeld Jones of Vancouver. After Jones' disavowal of the Æon of Horus and its Beast, however, Crowley reversed his earlier opinion a nd expelled Jones from the AA. 44 In his \"New Comment\" to the Book of the Law ca. 1920 CE, Crowley describes verses #II-75 & #II-76 as being a \"Qabalistic test,\" identify ing the person who may claim to be the Beast's Magical Heir. Moreover the solu tion will be conspicuous for the simplicity of its method, and its message will carry self-evident conviction. 45 The \"New Comment\" continues with a word of doubt expressed concerning Jones' announced attainment of the grade of Magister Templi (8 )=[3], inasmuch as Jones had not advanced sequentially through all of the lesser grades . Should it become evident that Jones had wrongfully assumed the (8)=[3], said Crowle y, he would develop into a \"Black Brother\" 46 and be destroyed. 47 Whether Jones deserves the title of \"Black Brother\" is debatable, but the latter prediction seems indeed to have come true. And many of the Aeon of HarWer sought to read this but could not. Nor could the Magus himself, though he guesse d rightly at its simplicity. It was said that every number is infinite -- hence each number or su m of joined numbers became merely the corresponding letter. The statement that every number is infinite is also in the Book of the Law [#I-4]. 48 The corresponding letters are those of the English alphabet, in keeping with the English text of the Book of the Law . Cabalists may desire an interpreta tion based upon the Hebrew alphabet or Cabala . In the Book of Coming Forth by Night , however, Set implicitly rejects the entire Hebraic mythos as a latter-day corruption of the Osiris cult. 49 The Cabala , whose authenticity is already questioned by reputable scholars of Jewish religion, is nowhere to be found in the Book of Coming Forth by Night , or, for that matter, in the Temple of Set. 50 Even so the sequence remained unknown -- and so, after its issue, to me as well. For, while I may pass free of the boundaries of ti me, memory of the future cannot exist. Set states that he may \"pass free of the bounda ries of time\" – a ra ther curious way of addressing the problem of time-travel. Yet su ch \"passing free\" seems to involve mental perception of the past and presen t only, not the future. This ha s interesting implications for those who believe in \"predestination\" (a fixed co urse of future events). The contrasting school is that of free will, which cannot exist unless the future is undetermined. The problem, as Crowley and Gurdjieff demonstrated, is one of identifying the true will and freeing it from mechanical conditioning, either conscious or subconscious. 51 "},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Time-travel – or, more precisely, the control of time – is a skill which is essential to a magician. Isaac Newton believed in the idea of a universal \"absolute time\" or \"linear duration\", saying that time is a thing in itself, not a relation between events. Leibnitz argued to the contrary, foreshadowing Einste in, who said in his 1905 paper: \"If we wish to describe the moti on of a material point, we give the values of its coordinates as functions of the time. Now we mu st bear carefully in mind that a description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by 'time'. We have to take into account that all judgments in whic h time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If for instance I say 'that train arrives here at seven o'clock', I mean something like this: 'The pointing of the small hand of my watch to se ven and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.' \"It might appear possible to overcome all the di fficulties attending to the definition of 'time' by substituting 'the position of the small hand of my watch' for 'time'. And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring at different places, or – what comes to the same thing – to evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the watch.\" 52 Then there was an effort to prove \"linear duration\" by the Second Law of Thermodynamics – the tendency of ordered mol ecular structure to decompos e (the phenomenon of entropy). Logically it is unsound, if it is assumed that the laws of motion are symmetrical for both directions of time. [Symmetry for \"reverse tim e\" can be demonstrated by the actions of particles at the subatomic level.] So \"time\" is not a fixed law which the magician cannot influence; he may at the very least accelerate or decelerate it. To \"pass free\" of it altogether, he would have to be a being like Set, i.e.: independent of the laws governing the objective universe. Now it has come to pass, and the Book of th e Law is laid bare -- \"Destined First Century heir -- Aquino -- breaking Keys by do ctrines Anton LaVey -- great Magus of reconsecration coming Year Xeper -- founding his rightful Priesthood -- Set -- true origin Volume AL.\" Michael Aquino, you are become Magus V° of the Aeon of Set. Collectors of magical happenstance may take not e of the following concerning the person of Michael A. Aquino: He was born in 1946, pr ecisely nine months after a Working by Crowley's California disciples to create a homunculus per a secret instruction of Crowley's to the IX of his Ordo Templi Orie ntis. He was also bor n dead, raising the question of the nature of the force inhabiting his subsequently revived body. On his chest he bears the same whorled swastik a appearing on Crowley and the Buddha, and from infancy his eyebrows have always curled upward into th e horns described in the Biblical Book of Revelation #13:11. He was ordained to the Sa tanic Priesthood by Anton LaVey on the night of the North Solstice V, and Recognized by Set as a Magus on the night of the North Solstice X. He has taken the name of the Prin ce of Darkness as a part of himself: Ra-en-Set \"He who Speaks as Set.\" I, Set, am come again to my friends among mankind -- Let my great nobles be brought to me."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Set has returned in his true identity, for the first time since the destruction of the original Temple of Set in ancient Egypt. \"Let my great nobles be brought to me\" is the same passage that, in hieroglyphs, surrounds the Seal of Se t at the end of the Book of Coming Forth by Night . In Khem I remain no longer, for I am forgotte n there, and my house at PaMat-et is dust. I shall roam this world, and I shall come to those who seek me. PaMat-et was the capital of the ancient Egyptian XIX Uab Nome. It was called Oxyrhynchus by the Greeks, and it was the center of the original Temple of Set. It is located in Upper Egypt at Latitude 28.5N, Longitude 30.8E. 53 Magus of my Aeon -- Manifest the Will of Set. The essential characteristic of a Magus is the ma nifestation of a philoso phical principle -- in magical terminology the \"utterance of a Word\" -- to supersede or enhance previous ways of understanding, actualizing, impr oving, and eventually transcending the human condition. Reconsecrate my Temple and my Order in the true name of Set. No longer will I accept the bastard title of a Hebrew fiend. When I resigned from the Church of Satan on June 10, X/1975, I spoke for its Mandate and, as a Magister Templi IV°, assumed the Sata nic High Priesthood. Initial steps were taken towards a \"second Church of Satan\" during the ne xt ten days. With the coming into being of the Book of Coming Forth by Night , those plans were dropped. The Temple of Set was organized, incorporated, and rec ognized nationally as a tax-exem pt religious institution within four months. The \"bastard title\" is \"Satan\", which is in He brew a title (\"Adversar y\") although in Egyptian it is the name Set-hen (\"Majesty of Set\"). It is by Set's name that he is known within his Temple and Priesthood, with \"Satan\" being used only to identify him by his historic image to the profane. When I first came to this world, I gave to you my great pentagram, timeless measure of beauty through proportion. And it was show n inverse, that creation and change be exalted above rest and preservation. The significance of the pentagram is discussed in my essay Black Magic in the Crystal Tablet of Set . With the years my pentagram was corrupted, yet time has not the power to destroy it. Its position was restored by the Church of Satan, but its essence was dimmed with a Moorish name, and the perverse letters of th e Hebrews, and the goat of decadent Khar. During the Age of Satan I allowed this curious corruption, for it was meant to do me honor as I was then perceived. As its emblem the Church of Satan used th e Sigil of Baphomet, an inverse pentagram decorated with a goat's head and surrounded by the Hebrew letters lamed/vav/yod/tav/nun = LVYTN = Leviathan, the sea monster menti oned in Job #41 of the Judaic/Christian Bible . The goat was the Goat of Mendes, the Devil's form of manifestation in traditional Satanism. 54 "},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"The term \"Baphomet\" -- the \"Moorish name\" -- came into prominence as the god reputedly worshipped by the medieval Knights Temple (Ord er of the Temple). There have been many colorful and creative explanations of this curious term, but the most sensible is that of Idries Shah, who in his book The Sufis suggests that it is a corruption of the Arabic abufihamat (pronounced \"bufihimat\"), which means \"fathe r\" or \"source of unders tanding.\" Going beyond Shah, this in turn may have been a corruption from the ancient Egyptian Ba-neb-Tettu , the hieroglyphic term for the city of Mendes, capital of the XVI Khar Nome in the Nile Delta at 31N, 31.5E, not far distant from Tanis. In Ptol emaic accounts Mendes was \"notorious\" for its goat-god, who was said to mate with human fema les in religious festivals. The truth is probably less lurid. Comments Budge in his Gods of the Egyptians : \"The title Ba-neb-Tettu was sometimes held to mean the 'Soul, the Lord Tettu', and this was the name at Mendes of the loca l form of Khnemu, whose symbol there, as elsewhere, was a ram ... He was regarded as the virile principl e in gods and men, and is styled 'King of the South and North, the ram, the virile male, the holy phallus which stirre th up the passions of love ...'\" But this is now my Aeon, and my pentagram is again to be pure in its splendor. Cast aside the corruptions, that the pentagram of Se t may shine forth. Let all who seek me be never without it, openly and with prid e, for by it I shall know them. The pentagram as used by the Temple of Set is re turned to its pure form, so that the beauty of phi is undiluted and undefiled. It is enclosed in a perfect circle (a function of pi ), which represents the mathematical order of the Univ erse. The pentagram does not touch the circle, however, signifying that Set is an independent entity. The pentagram itself does not appear on statues and bas-reliefs of Set that have come to light, nor does the Temple of Set use the image of Set against the pentagram in place of the Baphometic goat. Each may be c onsidered a \"key\" to knowledge of the other, rather than two parts of a whole. The reconsecrated Temple of Set displays the pentagram openly, and Init iates of all degrees wear a simple pentagram medallion as evidence of their affiliation. Let the one who aspires to my knowledge be called by the name Setian. The word \"Setian\" is now used to refer generally to all Initiates of the Temple of Set. It is used in a more specific sense as the formal title of the First Degree of Initiation, whose recipients are in the position of aspira nts to the knowledge of the Temple. I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid. A nd alone I cannot preserve my Elect, but I would teach them and strengthen their Will agai nst the coming peril, that they and their blood may endure. To do this I must give fu rther of my own Essence to my Elect, and, should they fail, the Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended. The term \"Elect\" refers to the degrees II and hi gher in the Temple of Set. In addition to avowing themselves Setians, such Initiates have been examined by the Priesthood and found Adept in the arts and sciences encompassed by the Temple. The Temple of Set does not judge"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"or evaluate Initiates by criteria outside of its specialized areas of expertise. Hence it is more an intellectual discipline or school of thought than a co mmunity per se. During the first several years of the Æon, I was inclined to interpret the warning of this passage in terms of the genera l ecological crisis confronting the human race as a whole during the next century. While the factors presaging that crisis remain, it is in creasingly obvious that the Temple of Set is far too selective in scope and interests to be a significant factor in confronting it. It seems more probable that Set's warning is meant to alert the Elect to the general fear which profane humans feel concerning Initiates of the Black Art, and in particular their tendency to search out scapegoats during tim es of stress, confusion, and crisis. [See also the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Parts of the Word of Set -- a warning to the original Temple of Set which proved all too justified.] The Temple of Set's response to this situation is first to dispel fear born of ignorance by explaining its exoteric doctrine s to the honestly curious, and secondly to avoid the careless over-simplification of its esoter ic doctrines in contexts which would tend to excite the superstitious dread of the profane. Concerning the \"gift of Set's own Es sence to the Elect,\" see also the Diabolicon , specifically the Statement of Azazel. Note agai n the phrase \"Majesty of Set.\" Behold, it is I who call you, because you are th e Guardians of the Aeon of Set, zealous in what you do. This is a salutation to the Council of Nine, th e highest officials of the Temple of Set and Guardians of the Æon. Their emblem is the sacred Tcham sceptre. They carry forward the tradition and name of the Nine Unknown, the basi s of the Church of Satan's Council of Nine and now of the Temple's Council. The Legend of the Nine Unknown, as recounted by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in their Morning of the Magicians , began with Asoka, Emperor of the Maurya Kingdom of India from appr oximately 274 to 236 BCE. He became a Buddhist ca. 260 BCE, and was famous for administ ering his kingdom according to the most enlightened principles. Before his death he se lected nine great sages to form a secret, protective society to carry on his life's work. Each One of the Ni ne would select nine deputies known to him alone, and each of these nine would select an additional nine, etc. [The legend was popularized in Talbot Mundy's 1925 novel The Nine Unknown .] 55 The High Priest of Set determines the policies and operations of the Te mple and Priesthood of Set, but he in turn is responsible to the Nine. 56 The Satanist thought to approach Satan th rough ritual. Now let the Setian shun all recitation, for the text of another is an affron t to the Self. Speak rather to me as a friend, gently and without fear, and I shall hear as a friend. Do not bend your knee nor drop your eye, for such things were not done in my house at PaMat-et. But speak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entran ce and not a barrier. And those who call me the Prince of Darkness do me no dishonor. Conventional religious ritual is a device for autohypnosis of the priest and varying degrees of mass-hypnosis for the audience. The mechanical liturgies have a relaxing, dulling effect upon the mind, placing it in the (alpha-wave) mood mo st receptive to the conditioning (i.e.: the sermon or other main body of the ritual)."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Ritual magic falls into two general categories, White and Black. These may be distinguished as follows: White Magic is a highly-concentrated form of conventional religious ritual. The practitioner seeks a focus of his awareness and powers of concentration via an extreme degree of autohypnosis. The technique may be used simp ly for meditation or entertainment through mental imagery (\"astral projection\"). Or it may be used to focus the Will towards a desired end -- a cure, curse, etc. To acco mplish this, the magician envisions a god or daemon with the power to achieve the goal, then concentrates his Will into an appeal. The god or daemon then carries out the appeal, more or less effec tively -- depending upon the strength of the magician's conviction of its pow er as a functioning entity. 57 Black Magic involves no autohypnosis or conditioning of the mind to make it receptive to induced imagery. Rather it is a deliberate and conscious effort to force the mind outward -- to impact upon and alter the \"laws\" of the objective universe. Thus it is an attempt to \"commit the same crime against God (= objective universa l inertia)\" as did Set: to place one's Self deliberately apart and distin ct from the objective universe. Undertaken non-ritually, employing rational/physical t echniques, it is termed Lesser Black Magic (LBM). Applied in formal ritual, in which mental Linkage with Set is sought , it is termed Greater Black Magic (GBM). [LBM and GBM are discussed in detail in Black Magic .] The Church of Satan and the Temple of Set have employed both White and Black Magic on various occasions. White Magic, obviously, is the more versatil e and less difficult of the two. It is also less of a strain upon the consciousness. Per the above definitions, all of the rituals contained in the Satanic Bible and Satanic Rituals are examples of White Magic. By its very definition, Black Magic may not be standardized or even describe d as a consistent routine. White Magic is practiced today on a fairly widespread basis by monotheists, pagans, spiritualists, Rosicrucians, Thelemites, and Satanists/Setians. Only Satanists/ Setians, according to my experience, actually know the \"m achinery\" of the technique they are using and why it works. An understandin g of and proficiency in White Magic is one prerequisite for Recognition of a Setian as an Adept II. An unde rstanding of and proficiency in Black Magic is an identifying characteristic of a fully proficient Adept II. Set was originally the god of th e hours of darkness; hence, pres umably, the suitability of the title \"Prince of Darkness.\" The word \"prince\" derives from the Latin Princeps , meaning \"first\". Etymologically this is not inappropriate. From a physical standpoint there are a surprising number of diffe rences between the hours of daylight and the hours of darkness. This cycle is , of course, controlled by the position of the Sun relative to the Earth. There are resultant changes in gravita tional pull, weather, the Earth's magnetic field, radiation levels, and both plan t and animal physiology. The impact of this cycle on the brain is as yet undetermined. 58 It may be noted that the sky, seemingly opaque by day, becomes transparent at night. Alpha Draconis is then visible. The Setian need conjure neither curse nor kindness from me, for by the magic of my great pentagram I shall see with his eyes. And th en the strength that is mine shall be the"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"strength of the Setian, and agains t the Will of Set no creature of the Universe may stand. And I think not of those who think not of me. The pentagram is here described as a geometric \"gate\" linking the mind of the Black Magician with that of Set [in a GBM Working]. The Temple of Set is also admonished to direct its efforts towards its own Initiates, not towards manki nd as a whole. A crucial distinction is thus drawn between humans who seek to develop their magical abilities and those who permit them to atrophy as they sink back to an ex istence harmonious with the objective universe. 59 The years of the Aeon of HarWer were confused, and I do not wish to think of them save as curiosities. But I wish to remember the C hurch of Satan and the Magus of that Age. Therefore let the years of my Aeon be counted from the conception of the Church of Satan. The Æon of Horus (commenced 1904 CE) has left few legacies of practical value to the magician. Those that do exist are heavily ti nged with error and in accuracy. Worthwhile principles may be identified only by individua ls who already possess the sophistic ation of judgment to formulate those principles themselves . This is an important point -- usually taken, unfortunately, only by thos e who do not need to. Anton Szandor LaVey and the Church of Satan ar e held in honor by Set, hence by the Temple of Set. The Age of Satan was a necessary catalyst to the Æon of Set, and all of its experiences, whether pleasant or painful, have been importa nt to the realization a nd implementation of the Æon. In subtle yet enduring reminder of this, the dating system empl oyed by the Church of Satan (1966 CE = I Anno Satani) is to be contin ued by the Temple of Set, with the initials A.S. [or AES] now signifying \"Æon of Set.\" And now, having looked upon the past with affection and reverence, we shall turn our gaze to the times before us. Think carefully of the Word of Set, for it is given in witness to my Bond. Many factors have gone into the design of the Æon of Set -- among them the legacy of ancient Egypt; the work of John Dee, Aleister Crowle y, & Anton LaVey; and the contributions of innumerable theorists, magicians, and meta physicians. Each is to be appreciated as appreciation is due; yet the orient ation of the Temple of Set must be to the future -- to the development of the new Æon and its unprecedented identity. The Word of Set has been discussed previously. Con cerning the Bond see the Statement of Belial in the Diabolicon . Behold, O West, I have established my Aeon. I punish the enemies who are in it, placed in the Place of Destruction. I deliver them to the examiners from whose guard there is no escape. Lo, I pass near to thee, I pass near to thee. This passage is conspicuous for its style, whic h lends itself to precise hieroglyphic translation. The \"Place of Destruction\" is the Tuat , of which Budge has written: \"The meaning of the name Tuat is unknown, and it is useless to speculate upon it or invent etymologies for it; it was applied to the home of the beatified spirits and the damned, no doubt in predynastic times, and the exact meaning it co nveyed to the minds of those who first used it"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"has been lost. To describe its general situation is less difficult, but not many details as to its exact extent are forthcoming. \"To find a word which shall at once descri be the situation and character of the Tuat is impossible, for the reason that the Egyptian co nception of the place of departed spirits is unique. The Tuat is not the 'Lower Hemisphere' because it is not under the ground, and, though for want of a better word I have frequent ly used 'Underworld' when speaking of the Tuat , it is unsatisfactory; for, unless it is specif ically defined to mean the place of departed spirits in general, it produces a wro ng impression in the mind. Again, the word Tuat must not be rendered by 'Hades' or 'Hell' or 'Sheol' or 'Jehannum', for each of these words has a limited and special meaning. On the other hand, the Tuat possessed the characteristics of all of these names, for it was an 'unseen' place, and it cont ained abysmal depths of darkness, and there were pits of fire in it wher ein the enemies of the gods were consumed, and certain parts of it were the homes of monsters in various shap es and forms which lived upon the unfortunate creatures whom they were able to destroy.\" 60 According to the Book of Gates , 61 the first region of the Tuat was called Set-Amentet , and also the Western Gate. 62 Affix now my image as it was given to you, so that all who read of these matters may now look upon the likeness of Set. Approximately a month prior to the North Sols tice X, I happened to be looking through some books of ancient art. Among the illustrations we re some mutilated images of Set, and I recalled Budge's comment that no known portr aits of the god had survived unmutilated. 63 Feeling a sudden sympathy for this \"old mythological figure,\" I decided to create at least one picture that was neither mutilated nor commer cial. After doing this, I surrounded it with hieroglyphs -- the phrase \"Let my great nobles be brought to me\" which would unexpectedly reappear in the Book of Coming Forth by Night . Satisfied with the design, I relegated it to my archives, presumably indefinitely. On the No rth Solstice, at approximately 4:30 AM, it was appended to the manuscript. The Word of the Aeon of Set is Xeper – Become Each magical Æon is characterized by a philo sophy, which may be summarized by a Formula, which may in turn be summarized by a Word. Th e Magus of an Æon \"Utters its Word\", i.e.: he formulates and explains the new ph ilosophy. Although Crowley speaks of only three historic Æons (Isis, Osiris, a nd Horus), he identifies eight Magi: Lao-Tzu, Gotama Buddha, Krishna, Tehuti (Thoth), Moses, Dionysus (Christ), Mohammed, and himself. Anton Szandor LaVey is the ninth, his number is Nine, and hi s Word is Indulgence. The Formula of the Age of Satan was an expansion of this Wo rd: Indulgence Instead of Abstinence. 64 I am therefore the tenth, appearing in the year X, and it has been my Task and Curse 65 to Utter the Word Xeper . This is the Egyptian hieroglyphic term fo r \"to become/to be/to come into being\", and it was personified by the god Xepera ( Kheph-Ra ). This god was portrayed as the scarab beetle, symbolizing Self-generation and the dawn. Summarily the Word Xeper refers to the transformation and evolution of the Will from a human to a divine state of being -- by deliberate, conscious, in dividual force of mind. The Formula of the Æon of Set is XXX = Xepera Xeper Xeperu = \"I Have Come Into Being and Created That Which Ha s Come Into Being.\""},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":" Footnotes 1.

Immediately after admitting that he is no philo logist and is \"without the least scientific knowledge of comparative languages\", Regard ie offers the above statement about Enochian -- which may be discounted acco rdingly. The story continues, however: Aleister Crowley included virtually the same sentence in his Confessions (page #612), again with no supporting evidence whatever. Then Anton LaVey, assuming that both Regardie and Crowley must have known what they were talking about, included virtually the same sentence in his Satanic Bible (page #155). Later attempts to validate Enochian as a language or to place it historically -- Donald C. Laycock's The Complete Enochian Dictionary (London: Askin, 1978) and Geoffrey Jame s' The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee (Berkeley Heights, NJ: Heptangle Bo oks, 1984) -- have met with similar failure. James, following Laycock, reaches the conclusion that the unpronounceable words and random letter arrangements of Enochi an indicate that it was designed for non- material entities [lacking vocal cords]! The la st word was written by Hans Holzer in his The Truth About Witchcraft (1969), in which he called th e language \"Inelkian\" and labeled it \"a form of distorted Hebrew!\" 9. For an example of how a jargon may be used, see pages #181-201 of the Satanic Rituals by Anton Szandor LaVey. Some years ago I ghost-wrote the enti re section on H.P. Lovecraft -- introduction and ri tuals -- for the book. It was the work of about two months to develop the jargon that became the \"nam eless language\" [I called it \"Yuggothic\"] of the Ceremony of the Nine Angles and the Call to Cthulhu . A word that sounded properly \"Lovecraftian\" would be constructed arbitrarily: El-aka = world, gryenn'h = [of] horrors. Then the word would be used consistently throughout the text of both rituals. Slight modifications of endings would suffice for different sentence constructions, and there you have a \"language\" every bit as flexible as Enochian! 10. Casaubon, op. cit. , page #120.

Used for the evocation was The Collected Dialogues of Plato , Hamilton & Cairns (Ed.), Princeton University Press, 1961. The full record of this Working was sent to the Priesthood of Set on November 6, X/1975, and is now in the Ruby Tablet of Set . 14. Kenneth Grant, co-editor of many of Crowley's works with John Symonds, has repeatedly and exhaustively tried to conn ect Set with Crowley's philosophy in general and with Aiwass in particular. [Cf. page #226 in Grant's Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God and page #x of Grant's introduction to The Magical Record of the Beast 666 .] Crowley's own writings, however, do not substa ntiate this. Crowley practically ignored Set, except for an occasional mention of the god in an Osirian-mythos context. In his principal discussion of the Devil on page #296 of Magick (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1973), for instance, he does not even include the name of Set. It is obvious that Crowley's orientation with regard to Egyptian theology was exclusively towards the Osiris-cult mythos. On page #399 of his Confessions , while discussing the sequence of magical aeons in terms of th e Osirian triad (Isis, Osiris, & Horus the Younger), he emphasizes the position of Horus as the avenger of his father Osiris -- a role accorded only the Osirian corruption. A dditional confirmations are to be found in Magical and Philosophical Comment aries on the Book of the Law , wherein \"Hoor-paar- Kraat\" is identified on page #94 as the \"God of Silence\" and \"Harpocrates\", both designations of Horus the Younger. On the following pages his position as the son of Osiris is restated. There are abundant additional examples. Grant also endeavors to identify Set with \"Shaitan\", whom he states was the god worshipped by the Yezidi in Mesopotamia. The Yezidi religious texts -- the Black Scripture and Book of the Revelation -- do not use the term \"Sha itan\" at all, calling the Yezidi deity by the name of Melek Taus, Taus Melek, or Taus-e Malak. [Only in LaVey's Satanic Rituals -- which contains several errors in its Yezidi section -- is the term \"Shaitan\" alleged to be a Yezidi term.] It is probably merely a Hebrew spelling of \"Satan\", and the Yezidi Book of the Revelation clearly establishes that the Yezidis considered Jews to be \"profane.\" Summarily Kenneth Grant arbitrarily rewr ites ancient Egyptian mythology, Yezidi mythology, and the philosophy of Aleister Crowley according to his personal tastes. 15.

Crowley's use of the term \"Qabala\" differs in key respects from conventional interpretations of the \"Hebrew\" Cabala. Fo r example: \"Qabala is an instrument for interpreting symbols whose meaning has beco me obscure, forgotten, or misunderstood by establishing a necessary connection between the essence of forms, sounds, simple ideas (such as number) and their spiritual, mora l, or intellectual equivalents. You might as well object to interpreting ancient art by consideration of beauty as determined by physiological facts.\" -- Crowley, 777 . New York: Samuel Weiser, 1970, page #125. 46. Crowley defines this term t hus: \"To attain the Grade of Magi ster Templi, he [the Adeptus Exemptus] must perform two tasks: the em ancipation from thought by putting each idea against its opposite and refusi ng to prefer either, and the consecration of himself as a pure vehicle for the influence of the order to which he aspires. He must then decide upon the critical adventure of our Order: the absolute ab andonment of himself and his attainments ... Should he fail, by will or weakne ss, to make his self-annihilation absolute, he is nonetheless thrust forw ard into the Abyss; but in stead of being received and reconstructed in the Third Order [the Silver St ar of the AA] as a Babe in the womb of our Lady Babalon, under the Night of Pan, to grow up to be Himself wholly and truly as He was not previously, he remains in the Abyss, secreting his elements around his Ego as if isolated from the Universe, and becomes what is called a 'Black Brother'. Such a being is gradually disintegrated from lack of nourishment and the slow but certain action of the attraction of the rest of the Universe, despite his now desperate efforts to insulate and protect himself, and to aggrandize himself by predatory practices. He may indeed prosper for awhile, but in the end he must perish, es pecially when with a new Æon a new Word is proclaimed which he cannot and will not hear , so that he is handi capped by trying to use an obsolete method of Magick, like a man with a boomerang in a battle where everyone else has a rifle.\" -- Crowley, Magick , page #332. 47. Here there is a paradox. To become a Magist er Templi, an individual is told to destroy his capacity for logical t hought, i.e.: his ability to draw deductive or inductive conclusions from the phenomena of the objec tive universe. Since it is precisely this capacity that produces the \"mirror in which the Self may be seen\" (Cogito Ergo Sum), the aspirant is invited to obliterate just what it is that enables him to perceive himself as a unique entity. Theoretically he is \"reconstructed by the gods in a perfect form\" -- an ideal \"self\". Herein lies the heart of the paradox: It is that an independent Will, capable of perceiving itself in contrast to the objectiv e universe, cannot be entirely a product of forces derivative of that universe. [See Black Magic .] True freedom of the Will necessitates the ability of that Will to m ove both with and against objective-universal patterns (\"laws\"). The Will is Self-creating, Self-sustaining, and Self-improving. [This is"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"the basis for the Formula of the Æon of Set XXX.] Because of the paradox, it is impossible for a Ma gister Templi to be the result of such an annihilation as Crowley prescribes. Such a \"Magister\" would possess no Will of its own; it would be a zombie, non-consciously moving in harmony with the objective-universal laws. It would be an animated corpse, a mere \"meat machine.\" This would not be a re- birth of the Self; it would be suicide under the illusion of part icipating in a \"greater life force.\" Now let us look a little more closely at Crowle y's description of a \"Black Brother\". Those familiar with Crowley's life will note that, in these few short phrases, a veritable blueprint for his own life has been pres ented. Crowley's writings attest to the overwhelming presence of his individual Will in all of his enterprises. The inevitable conclusion is that there is no Right-Hand Path to the initiatory level of Magister Templi [at least not as prescribed by the original GD and AA]. There is only the Left-Hand Path, and it is fraught with danger -- not a one-time crossing-the- Abyss test, but a continuous peril that exists from the moment the indi vidual completely realizes him-Self as a Magister. The Magister Templi is one who can comprehe nd the entire objective universe. In order to do this, he cannot have vision which is dist orted by instinctive assu mptions internal to that universe. He -- his Will -- must be independent, separate, and distinct. This necessitates an extremely str ong presence of mind, a persona lity that is sufficiently secure not to require \"crutche s\" from the objective universe, and a determination to fight off the panic that could result from the sens ation of being utterly alone. The Magister Templi, if he is truly entitled to that degr ee, possesses the abilities necessary to thwart these dangers. Those who presume to that de gree without apprecia ting these dangers or the severe mental pressures they can cause , do in fact suffer the fate that Crowley prescribes: death or loss of sanity [or mere relapse from that level of initiation to a less- stressful one, or even to profane \"freedom from initiation\" ... Cf. Fromm, Escape from Freedom ]. Charles Stansfeld Jones is a well-known case in point. 48. Crowley develops this concept in a brilliant essay appended to 777 which he also included in his later commentar ies on the Book of the Law. Its central thesis may be found in the following included statements: \"By adding 1 to 8 we obtain 9, so that we might define unity as that which has the property of transforming a three-dimensiona l expansion of two into a two-dimensional expansion of three. But if we add unity to 9, unity appears as that which has the power of transforming the two-dimensional expansi on of three aforesai d into a mere oblong measuring 5 by 2. Unity thus appears as in po ssession of two totally different properties. Are we then to conclude that it is not the same unity? How are we to describe unity, how know it? Only by experiment can we discove r the nature of its action on any given number. In certain minor respects, this acti on exhibits regularity. We know, for example, that it uniformly transforms an odd number into an even one, and vice versa; but that is practically the limit of what we can predict as to its action. \"We can go further, and state that any number soever possesses this infinite variety of powers to transform any other number, even by the primitive process of addition. We observe also how the manipulation of any two numbers can be arranged so that the result is incommensurable with either, or even so that ideas are created of a character totally"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"incompatible with our original conception of numbers as a series of positive integers. We obtain unreal and irrational e xpressions, ideas of a wholly different order, by a very simple juxtaposition of such apparently comprehensible and commonplace entities as integers. \"There is only one conclusion to be drawn from these variou s considerations. It is that the nature of every number is a thing peculiar to itself, a th ing inscrutable and infinite, a thing inexpressible, even if we could understand it.\" – Crowley, 777 , pages #134-135. 49. The cultural integrity and reli gious identity of the Hebrews will stand some dispassionate re-examination, since Egyptian records during the time of the fabled \"Exodus\" mention nothing of the events or persona lities contained in that chap ter of the Bible. Cf. Pierre Montet, Lives of the Pharaohs , Cleveland: World Publis hing Company, pages #197-199. Montet is a Member of the French Institute and Honorary Professor at the College de France. Cf. also John Romer, Testament , New York: Henry Holt, 1988, page #58. Romer is a distinguished archae ologist and Egyptologist. 50. The \"Hebrew Cabala\" is a nebulous and inconsistent hodge-podge of superstitious mummery, phrased in language both impreci se and ambivalent, and hung loosely about the equally-insubstantial main stream corpus of Hebrew superstition. According to Richard Cavendish, writing in the Encyclopaedia of the Unexplained (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974), the \"Hebrew Cabala's \" oldest identifiable works can be authenticated to between the third and sixth centuries CE. Since that time it has been added to and revised by innumera ble occultists, with the result that it has lost even what cohesion it may once have had. 51. The most lucid explanation of the Gurdjieff a pproach to this subject is contained in P.D. Ouspensky's The Psychology of Man's Possibl e Evolution (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969). Crowley did not address the notion of free will in depth, save perhaps indirectly in Liber Aleph . He seems to have interpreted the idea in a mystical sense, along the lines of The Sacred Magic of Abra=Melin the Mage (S.L.M. Mathers [Trans.], Chicago: deLawrence, 1948).

The Curse of a Magus is that, since he necessarily Utters his Word in an envir onment unfamiliar with it, few will initially comprehend or tolerate that Word. Concerning the Book of Coming Forth by Night On the North Solstice of the year X, Magister Michael A. Aquino of the Church of Satan performed a Greater Black Magica l Working of Communication that produced several results, one of the least intere sting of which was an inspired document called the Book of Coming Forth By Night . Because most of the various products of this still ongoi ng and transpersonal Working are not subject to easy manipulation, the BoCFbN has attracted a good deal of attention, and is quite the coll ectible in the occult undergroun d, as well as an occasionally posted item on various websites and other elec tronic archives. That the Temple of Set maintains the copyright of the document, a nd does defend this copyright, seems of little interest to certain people who, having created no intellectual pr operty in their lives, scarcely feel the need to respect others. From an institu tional point of view, I st rongly urge the Temple to continue its policy of prot ecting the copyright of the docum ent; from a personal point of view, I am not too worried about it. The type of personality that could get in psychic trouble mucking about with it is the same sort that could get in trouble with Alice in Wonderland . On a level of sentiment, I am always pissed-off when I see the document altered or prefaced by bizarre and insulting remarks, but such things ar e part of the current Internet culture's lower levels. This brief essay will explain what a Communicat ion document is, what use the Temple of Set has put the document to, what dangers exist in such documents, and lastly the growing insignificance of such documents at the Dawn of the postmodern era.

You don't call god on the telephone to chat about the weather; you call ou t of great Need, the same sort of Need that might make you call up your wisest professor years after finishing school. In a self-sufficient system (ie. the Le ft Hand Path), you know that god isn't going to answer you with help. All god may give is Clarit y. Set was and is the Pharaoh's Teacher of the art of Archery, he doesn't fire the arrows for you, but if your purpose and His and are resonate, he may clarify the content of your mi nd to allow you to see the target. For most of mankind such clarification never occurs, because it is a Curse. Like the Magus Moses, you will see the promised land, but you will never step foot into it. You will have the unpleasant Task of trying to tell others that there are beha viors and thoughts that wi ll give them Power to Work on themselves, while they are trapped in the received notions of the world, which are inherently disempowering. The Cursed one, w hom we call a Magus (a lthough other titles such as Rishi would work as well), isn't better, smarte r, or a more powerful magician than those he or she leads. He or she expects that others will do more with the Teaching then he or she has. Every Plato waits for his Aristotle. A Working of Communication then is based on Need. A great de al has been written by people who were there (I was learning Latin in junior high at the time), ascribing the Need to Howard Stanton Levey's design to sell the degree system of the Church of Satan. I can not comment on this, from my vantage point this decision looks resonate with his philosophy. It would likewise be a true Sign of that philosophy to clear out when you realize you've been had. I see the Fulfillment of Levey's Teachings in the exodus of many Church of Satan Priests under Michael Aquino. In this act of re bellion, the Temple has maintained its contact wi th the Prince of Darkness in his archetypical form as Satan, but such a connection is a fairly low voltage connection compared to what mankind is capable of (see below). It is the Act of Rebellion that makes the magical and philosophical conne ction, not the document associated with the Working. I would fully expect the Priesthood of Set to either toss me out or rebel if I attempted to change the Temple from a School in to a personal vehicle. If any of the Priests feels a greater personal loyalty to me or Michael Aquino or the next High Priest or Priestess than to the Set's Eternal Purpose, then they are not Priests but sheep with shiny black medallions. However the Working did change the focus of LHP role models from the archetype of the Rebel against cosmic injustice to the archetype of Isolate Intelligence. Set is a fairly complex figure that fights for his own Power by killi ng Osiris, and for the Cosmic Good by slaying Apep so that the Boat of Re can keep moving. Se t is most easily grasped as a Divine model of self-enlightened, self-enli ghtening self interest. The reason for the Working began much earlier, in 1904 in Cairo. There Aleister Crowley had a Need to create Space. There we had a young ma n with great gifts of mind and magic, who Needed to flush out of himself the received no tions that clustered around Christianity, British class thinking and sexual mores, and the notions of Imperialism. His Working communicated a Word, which he knew well both as a middling Greek scholar but more importantly as an excellent scholar of French literature, Thelema . This is a Word whose essential message is \"Courage.\" A Divine commandment to Do things in the world despite the social restrictions of society, and to obtain Self Knowledge ther eby. The Word Thelema reached one of its pinnacles in Lavey's Word of Indulgence . The Church of Satan was light years ahead of any esoteric organization of its time, because it viewed occultism as form of madness (quite correctly). It provided a Space creating device fo r its practitioners. One could take on all of"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"the false limits of society, burn away one's ne urosis, and otherwise realize the healthy tiger within by killing the sick sheep without. The C hurch of Satan failed in that after this great moment of purification, it had nothing more to tell you. Creating Space is the first step to building something better on it. The Wo rking that communicated the Word of Xeper , occurred because of the succe ss of other Workings which created a Space for growth. A Working of Communication, su ch as Michael Aquino perfor med on North Solstice in the Year X, has four components. Firstly the conten ts of the brain of the individual: This will determine the language and factua l material. Secondly the rest of the body-soul complex: This generally unmanifest part of the human being is sometimes called the Higher Self. This is the potential for Becoming. As opposed to New Age thinkers who stress the unlimited model of mankind, Left Hand Path thinkers stress the limits of Being as a key to power. Know what you are and can be -- it is only from this know ledge that you can Work effectively. Thirdly the matrix of the culture: All such Workings are in the language and thought of the time. So if one wishes to analyze the BoCFbN , one must not only look at it as an expression of the Ageless Intelligence of the Universe, but as something written in California in the '70s. This is not a dismissive remark -- it if the key to unde rstanding the nature of the interaction between Initiatory magic and history. Why there? Why then ? Fourthly the Intent of Set in creating the document: This later is useful to persons wan ting to map the mind of Set for the reasons of seeing what centers of their ow n personality they wish to de velop to Become likewise an immortal, potent, and powerful Essence. Without these components such Books will mislead. If one treats the book as a Divine Communication like Right Hand Pa th religions treat their scri ptures, one is lost. The Book achieved four things. Firstly it empowere d Michael Aquino by allowing for a sudden restructuring of his psyche. It gave him M eaning, allowing him to see (as every Left Hand Path thinker must see toward th e end of his or her Initiation) that all the details of his life Become an absolute source of Power that is i ndeed greater then the Po wer spread through the rest of mankind's brains. Secondly the Book revealed new depths of Being (see below); rather than saying \"Ok, Mike you're it! \" it revealed that there was a very, very long way to go -- an infinite Darkness within that could be manife sted in the world without. Thirdly it dissolved certain sentimental attachments and personal ity weaknesses. Now one does not achieve liberation from the bullshit of the world in a single Working -- what ever personal weaknesses the 28 year old Aquino had before the Working he had after it. But such Workings give a glimpse of what it would be like to be free of such limitations. Fourthly it Created in Aquino a magnetic coherence. That is to say that after the Work, his Vision of what Could Be done in the World was fixed enough that he could not arti culate it, but drew people to him to drink of that Graal. In short it was a Recognition Ceremony. What has the Temple of Se t used the do cument for? For the first eighteen years of its Manifest ation, the Temple of Set placed the BoCFbN in the Crystal Tablet of Set for magical reasons. The Crystal Tablet is the basic Setian document describing the cosmology, ontology, epistemology, protocols, and prac tical working magical techniques of the Temple of Set. It is part of the fourfold formula of allowing so meone who Seeks after the Mystery of Set to Become Adept in the Black Arts. The four part s are a coherent central articulation of Setian thought (the Crystal Tablet ), the interaction with others who have applied the philosophy in objectively quantifiable ways, the previous experience of the Init iate, and the ability of that"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Initiate to perform a Creative and Unique Synthesi s of the first three items that changes his or her thought and life. In our first Working Year (from X [1975] to XXVIII [1993]) we placed the BoCFbN in the Crystal Tablet as a \"jump starting\" device. Like all magical writings (such as this essay), it draws Attention, Transforms it, and Returns to the source of Attention, in the hopes that impel action. The symbol-rich and poe tic language of the BoCFbN served to give each Initiate some of the same experience that Michael Aquino had -- it gave them a taste of Meaning, Adventure, Freedom (the loos ening of fetters) and Being (C oherence). This foretaste was enough for many to seek their own adventures, wa nting not fleeting glimpses in the words of another, but True experience of their own. The results of this decision was the establishmen t of an international Temple that survived various media and even governmental at tempts to suppress or destroy it. After our First Working Year, we applied the basic principle of the Setian School -- turning Students into Teachers. Instead of making use of a primary Initiatory event of one Initiate, who was after all not a graduate of the Temple of Set system, we choose to let the Attention of students be Transformed by the lives of our Priesthood. This means that each Priest or Priestess began a new level of magical and philo sophical responsibility, in that rather than looking to a document by the human founder, Setians looked long and hard at their Priesthood. This is a dangerous gamble, this trust business, but it is the gamble that will establish a Left Hand Path school that will endu re rather than one based on the strengths and weaknesses of its leaders. The BoCFbN was placed in the Ruby Tablet of Set , which is a document designed to assist the Second Degree in his or her quest fo r Strength, much as the Crystal Tablet helps in the quest for Meaning. The Ruby Tablet is a celebration of Life and all its possibilities, offering a rich and varied account of many Setians magical and philosophical pursuits. This change represent a profound notion in Se tian thinking. We classify even our Founding Magic as part of the realm of the possible for all Setians. The Work of our best and brightest is valued not because of the awe we might hold fo r them -- but because it stands as a constant external reminder of what might be achieved. We are not interested in a Temple of a few great men and women. We are interested in creating an environment that produces many great men and women. One giant is a genetic fluke, a race of giants is a way of changing the world. What dangers exist in such documents? Text is subject to a great deal of manipulati on, which is why books alone are not and can not be the basis of Initiation. On a day when you are very mad at your nei ghbor, all books are about what a scum your neighbor is and your own nobility. If you are in love, all books are abou t love. If you are in denial all books offer new and potent formulas for denial. Books that provide a certain coherence are good in that they may pull you away from the places you have let your emotions lead you to. If a book teaches the Initiatory lesson that your emotions should follow you, rather than you them , the book is worth its weight in silver."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"In moments of clarity are books of Value. If you can find a series of circumstances that cause moments of clarity, then such book is worth its weight in gold. If the book contains the rules that can produce more moments of clar ity, then is it is a gem of the first water. If the book can provide rules that allow for more than one pe rson to achieve a moment of clarity and communicate his or he r Understanding to a nother who is also experiencing clarity, the book has is an intimate spark of living fire. Such in my opinion is the value of the Crystal Tablet of Set . For someone that wants to work hard for Power and Knowledge, and is almost in possession of these things, the Temple's primary text is beyond any dollar amount. However most of us, despite our lofty sounding claims, want a short a nd easy enlightenment. So we play absurd games with the letters and numbers of a text, try to read hidden knowledge into it (when we can't figure out the obvious knowledge), and othe rwise engage in hobby pursuits. Such distraction can lead us into a va riety of defective thought processes, and if we feel that the text we are playth ing with is of divine origin, we feel somehow that god wants us to do these absurd things -- thus we make our own Sleep sacred and move daily away form the very things that we claim to seek. This danger is great, and in this sense any inspired text is a trap for the hobbyist. Why will such books be come less significan t in the Aeonic age? World History has passed through three great epochs and is passing in to a fourth. In classical times we had a grea t growth of many paradigms. This lead to great schools of philosophical inquiry. We would be hard pressed to look at the philosophies of ancient Greece alone, and think by comparison th at we have made any progre ss toward Knowing the answers of the questions posed by Life. But two things were lacking, one a system of universals that allowed philosophies to be taught, exchange d, and improved across the boundaries of time and space. Secondly a useful knowledge of th e material world that could empower the philosophic seeker to realize hi s or her Ideas in the world. In medieval times we had one paradigm. On e god, one book, one thought system across racial and cultural lines. This produced many good things. A realizati on of the need of a common language (then Latin, now Englis h), common time keeping, and ru les for international travel. In short, in the middle ages the design for a se t of common factors that enabled the Word to go forth from Rome, or Mecca, or Constantinopl e, or Beijing -- created the Idea of a common basis for commucation. In modern times the paradigm of science -- of approaching the world rationally as a way of controlling it -- has given us many things. We liv e twice as long as we used to -- pretty important if you are going to spend time figur ing out the answers mentioned above. We can travel almost anywhere in a short period of time. We can interact with other minds in a moment. The power of the indiviua l is at an all time high because of science, but because of the human beings' natural laziness this power is usually turned against the Self, as we learn ways to keep ourselves distracted."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"The postmodern however will be the synthesis of the three preceding. It will have the growth of many, many paradigms for inquiry. These w ill be communicated by universal means from books to the Internet. They will be empowered by the mastery of the natural science makes possible. In such a time, the inspired book of another will matter less, because the most important acquisition of the individual will be a philosophy system that helps him or her utilize the historical fo rces that are coming into being now. The Temple of Set seeks to create such a system, and is always looking for fine mi nds and fearless hearts that may contribute to the system's perfection. There is long way to go, but a long way has already been covered in our first 23 years of Striving.

The emphasized term \"Gift\" refers to the non-natural expansion of human intellectual capacity that occurred in prehisto ric times. \"Word\" refers to the Word of Set , discussed below. There are no records of the ancient Pr iesthood of Set through which \"High Priest MehenPetTha\" might be identified, but the name can be rendered in hieroglyphics. \"Khem\" is a phonetic version of the hieroglyphic Xem , one of the many titles of the ancient Egyptian nation. Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, and va nquish thus the feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my tr ue Word and now are an affront to me. On April 13, 1584 CE John Dee, mathematician and magician to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, undertook a series of Workings in Cracow, Poland. With the assistance of Edward Kelley, he wrote into his diaries a seri es of nineteen magical incanta tions in what he called the \"Enochian or Angelic language.\" With each in cantation or Key, Dee provided an English translation, also communicated by the angels to Kelley. The Dee diar ies were eventually deposited in the British Museum. In 1659 CE a printed version of th e Dee diaries including the Keys was published by Meric. Casaubon as A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Years between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits . In the late nineteenth century, the Keys were adopted into the magical inventory of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the L ondon-based Rosicrucian society. The Golden Dawn altered and augmented the Casaubon version in order to align the Keys with its own emphasis on Egyptology and the Hebrew Cabala. Its publications asserted a mastery of the Enochian language by the leaders of the Order. Aleister Crowley la ter incorporated the Golden Dawn edition of the Keys into his A :. A :. (Argenteum Astrum = Silver Star), again claiming fluency in Enochian and constructing rituals from Enochian words and phrases. The Keys next appeared in 1969 CE, when An ton LaVey took the Cabalistic version from Crowley's Equinox , replaced Judaic / Christian referen ces with correspondingly Satanic ones, and included the result in the Satanic Bible . The general sensation caused by this book, together with a considerable amount of i ndignation on the part of old-line Cabalists, eventually inspired a revival of interest in John Dee and hi s magical diaries. In 1974 CE Stephen Skinner brought out a second (facsimile ) edition of A True and Faithful Relation , a copy of which I acquired in March X. Classification: V2 - A17.122 - 2 Author: Dr. Michael A. Aquino VI° Date: April 13, XVI (2) HTML Revision: Sept. 21, 1998 CE Subject: The Word of Set Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Upon comparing the facsimile diaries to th e Golden Dawn, Crowley, and LaVey Keys, I realized the extent of the di stortion that had taken place. Be ing familiar with language and cipher construction, I set out to unr avel the original Keys to dete rmine their linguistic lineage. After some weeks of work, I conc luded that Enochian as it is is not a true language. Rather it is an artificial jargon, i.e.: arb itrary words placed together in roughly consistent sequences to simulate a true language. It is so cleverly done that it can fool non-linguists fairly easily. It is even possible to \"write\" in Enochian as Crow ley did, altering suffixes to create the impression of declension or conjugation. But a comprehensiv e grammar, essential to a true written and spoken tongue, is lacking. Once I realized Enochian to be a jargon, I ch anged my approach. Now I suspected that it might be some sort of cipher or code, Dee being famous for his use of same. I tested the first three Keys against a variety of code-breaking techniques. Once more I met with no success. I had not held high hopes that I w ould. The loose alignment of E nochian words to their English counterparts, together with an entirely differe nt frequency of indivi dual letters in the two languages [even cancelling out the most divergen t letters], makes cipher improbable. Only pure code -- with Enochian words or letters m eaning something not revealed by their internal design alone -- remained. To uncover such a code , one would simply have to know the words or phrases in English triggered by a given E nochian word or phrase, unrelated though the connection might otherwise be. [For example, the otherwise random appearance of \"vorsg\" might be code for \"for the eyes of the Queen alone,\" etc.] Two avenues of investigation remained. First, if it were true that Enochian was neither language nor cipher, then there was still the possibility that it might be a corruption of a genuine tongue. Regardie [citing Mathers' me thod], Crowley, and LaVey had all accepted Kelley's comment that \"He seemeth to read as He brew is read.\" I decided to eliminate this Hebrew-letter pronunciation en tirely, treating each word as a phonetic unity and deemphasizing the vowels. [Thus \"vorsg\" should be pronounced just that way, rather than \"vaoresaji.\"] My test case was the XIX Key, 30 th Aethyr (TEX) on the assumption that there might be visual results per Crowley's experi ences in The Vision and the Voice . This time there was certain success, an example of which is given in the new A&C. Finally, during the evening of May 30, I experimented with the XVII Key and wa s rewarded with spec tacular results: the Working later recorded and reprinted in the Ruby Tablet as The Sphinx and the Chimaera . Then, in the first week of June, something quite unexpected happened. I began to write a text in installments of one or two hours per night. In much the same style as the future Book of Coming Forth by Night, it presente d the Enochian Keys as a remote corruption of something called the Word of Set . There followed two \"pure\" Keys in English -- called \"parts\" of the Word of Set . Before proceeding further I was forced to break my concentration because of the subsequent crisis in the C hurch of Satan, and so the Word of Set remained unfinished for the next several years. The Working has now been completed, and the Word of Set will appear as an appendix of the new A&C (3) and is herewith enclosed for advance reference by the Priesthood. As to the \"breaking\" of the Keys \"by the doctrin es of Anton LaVey,\" therein lies still another tale: Anton's principle contributi on to the Crowley Keys was to render them in what might be called a \"Black Mass\" form, with Heavenly refe rences arbitrarily changed to Hellish ones. One might presume that this would invalidat e the statements of the text, but, oddly enough,"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"the use of the \"Black\" Keys by the Church of Satan produced magical results that were, if anything, far more potent than those of the \"pure\" system. In my Working on the Word of Set , I used Anton's approach to tran slation, seeking words and phrases to express what I sensed the Keys were actually conveying in their confuse d, inconsistent, original English. Moreover the North Solstice X Working which resulte d in the Book of Coming Forth by Night was begun with this new First Part of the Word of Set rather than with the first Enochian Key. Such would seem to be the basis for the Book of Coming Forth by Night 's reference to the \"breaking\" of the Dee Keys and the restoration of the Word of Set . In the Satanic Bible the Enochian Keys, even in their altered form, are still garbled and unintelligible. Hence Anton felt the need to venture an interpretation of each one preceding its text. These interpretations have no basis in previous documents, and indeed previous commentators -- including Dee himself -- have been unable to integrate the Keys into a meaningful translation. After completing the Working of the Word of Set , I found that the new translation needed no external interpretation -- at least not to those for whom it was evidently intended. It is obviously not a word-for-word translation; it is idiomatic, with each concept being translated into English best suited to convey its meaning. This past year, furthermore, I learned that the Casaubon account of the Dee Keys was not as error-free as I had previously supposed. My be nefactor was Dennis Garrett I°, who kindly provided me with a photocopy of the original Dee diary Keys from the British Museum and also lent me microfilm reels of additional Dee material. Accordingl y the \"Enochian\" text appearing here is an exact c opy of the original as John Dee penned it, including capitalization. As I have noted above, this orig inal does not lend itself to gra mmatically-based translation or to word-for-word correlation with Dee's own English translation. [The most recent efforts to do so -- in Donald Laycock's Enochian Dictionary (4) resulted in an arbitrary subdividing of the Enochian text and an English-based punctuation in order to approach a correlation. The result is not conclusive.] I include the original \"E nochian\" here on the presumption that the success of my own Workings w ith this phonetic text justifies its connection with the translated Word of Set . A historian might challenge my translation on th e grounds that it is no t the English version written by John Dee. On scholarly grounds I gr ant that objection. As a magician, however, I would answer that, concluding that the Keys as understood by Dee were a corruption of a pre- Judaic / Christian text, my own Wo rking for its original meaning is at least as valid as Dee's -- more so, since the cosmological premises for Setian Workings are sounder than those of Elizabethan times. As it appears here, then, the Word of Set is an eighteenfold sequence of statements addressed to the original (\"third ordering\") Initiates of the Temple of Set in ancient times. It is oddly like a Book of Coming Forth by Night for them in more ways than one: It identifies its source, it explains to the Initiates exactly what they ar e, it warns them against dangers from ordinary (\"second ordering\") humans, it admonishes them in certain ways, it shadows forth the return of the Temple in the future, and it ex alts the Black Flame directly in the 18 th Part.

Of Spirituality – that drive to tran scendence -- to become higher, To transcend our present se lves by touching infinity. Of Mortality – what binds us to the earth The mortality that is the product of our becoming – the essence of what we are The foundation from which we Become. Of the Sensual – That feeling that forms a link betw een Mortality and Transcendence – The joy of being combined with the ecstasy of Becoming! During this Working, I performed the consecrati on of the flame. The incense used in this Working was supplied by Priestess Nielsen, an d in performing the consecration, I was to utilize the characteristic s of the herbs. A short list was supplied to me as a guideline. I spent quite a bit of time afterwards contemplating what this statement meant to me. I was quite surprised and pleased with the results. Analysis: The opening four lines is a st atement of the symbolic nature of the flame. The flame symbolizes the avenue we have taken to unl ock the mysteries of life. The flame also represents the force that drives us to unlock these doors -- the fundamental drive that causes us to seek out and understand these mysteries. Of Spirituality – that drive of tr anscendence – to become higher... This first part of the Triad deals with transcenden ce. This is the desire of the magician to rise above his present state of being to a new level of existence. In so doing, the spirit seeks out the infinite. Kierkegaard wrote a great deal on this concept. To him, transcendence occurs when the individual is able to see and understand the universal forces operating within the particular situation. Put another wa y, this is seen in the ability to see the forces at work within a given life situation. By understa nding this higher idea, we are able to rise above our present level of understanding. For Kierke gaard, this is seen in the tr ansformation from the esthetic (finite) into the ethical (infinite). What is important here is that by approaching infinity we are able to rise above our present levels of bei ng. That is, we must strive for the infinite. Of Mortality – what binds us to the earth... This section deals with our curr ent state of being. As mortal beings, we are bound to the earth, and because of this mortality we must define w ho we are. Our current state of being is a kind of sum of our past stat es – we have moved up to where we are from our past levels of being (\"the product of our becoming\"). However, this state of being is tenuous at best. Because we are free to choose (condemned to be free -- Sartre ), we are not simply the sum product of our past. You cannot take what the individual is now and extrapolat e back and determine what he was a moment before. Likewise, you cannot take what the indivi dual is and define what he"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"will be a moment from now. This is the state of nothingness in which man finds himself. Still, we are in our present state because we have tr anscended our past states, and from our present state we strive to attain our next state. Of the Sensual – That feeling that forms a link between Mortality & Transcendence... In the act of Becoming we encounter the Sensual. This is the actual fe eling of Transcendence – of moving from what we are to what we w ill be. We leave our present state of being and through the Sensual become what we will be. This is the \"ecstasy of becoming.\" This concept has its corollary in va rious schools of thought t oo numerous to mention. However, since I am biased toward the Greeks, let me mention Ar istotle. To him motion and the process through which substances underwent change were si milar. Change involved a substance passing through one state to the next (this is a very simplified version). It is through this process, or through the Sensual, that the act of creation takes place. Th e ideal of ecstasy is best understood when we look at the etymology of th e word. Ecstasy comes from the Greek, EK STASIS meaning to be outside of oneself. By projecting ourselves out of a state of nothingness we create what we will be. When I sat back and thought through the ideas in this utterance and what they meant to me, I realized this is an elaboration of the aeonic formula X. X. X. Fr om our past state of being we create what we will be: Mortality – Sensuality – Spirituality, (Xeperu, Xeper, Xepera). I was quite pleased when I realized this, as it was totally unintentional at the time of the Working. This revealed to me the ideas at work w ithin myself, and how these ideas are becoming known to me and shaping the way I interpret my world. It was a joy to see how these ideas are becoming an integral part of myself, how I am using the aeonic formula to shape the way I think. Hail Set! P.S. One thing though, the order of my Utteranc e was not in the same as the formula should be (Xeperu is given first not third.) Oh well, I am a First Degree.

It will be necessary to utilize wi sdom and a higher sense for comprehension. This is written for the minds and hearts of Black Magicians and none ot her, for only they possess the intuition and insight required. There shall be ancient and occult language used with new meanings, and a new language used with ancient and occult m eanings. It is each Magician's task to comprehend Truth (Ma'at) and to Become it. To consider undertaking the ch anges and creation that are ne cessary within the Being to Xeper and to create Xem, it is most important to seriously consider a ll the implications. Xem shall require a great amount of zealousness, of Magical work, of self-discipline, of self- inspection, and no compromise. It is up to each aspirant to determine their own Willingness and readiness to meet the challenge of ente ring Xem. Once begun, there is no going back, for it is a new dimension of Being th at is initiated. To begin and th en to turn back, the aspirant will lose all that has been gained and worse yet, that which was gained will become as a malignancy against which there is no cure. It must be further understood that with this new dimension of Being which is ever evolving, the Work shall not be accomplished by empl oying human standards which are but games, petty religion, and politics. Neither is the Work involved in an organizational concept like any other on Earth. Rather it is the constant cons truction of a metaphysica l/magical/philosophical state of Being and State of Beings -- with the principles of Xeper and Ma'at as the cornerstones. Withal, the Will cannot and must not relax. Those who are not ready or will not understand these things should wait until they recognize Xe m. But to wait too long might cause the Will to grow weak, and they might be imprisoned in lower states of re st and preservation. Those who decide to Work and accept that which comes with the Work will Xeper and actualize Xem. To hesitate, to ra tionalize in human terms, to feel negativeness or fear or lack of confidence may negate Xeper. The aspirant mu st be conscious of that which he is and is not; which he knows and knows not; which he doe s and does not; which he Wills and Wills not; which is Ma'at and is not Ma'at. The aspira nt can be conscious of all this, but he must Work for it. The Elect who shall Work toward Xem must also know that alone the Work cannot be completed. The Elect must realize that the Wo rk shall require assistance from Set and the other Ancient Ones, for Xem is many-sided. In or der to Work with them, the Elect must be constantly aware of themselves and consciously aware of Set -- as well as the Old Ones with whom they shall Work. Xem shall not otherwise be accomplished. To Become and to maintain the new level of Be ing while aspiring even higher is an enormous task, and to incorporate human weaknesses, im perfections, emotional insecurities, and other personal flaws into the Xeper process will resu lt in those impurities being later magnified, intensified, and manifest in Xem. This would in sure disaster for the Magician, extreme danger to the Elect in Xem, and the possible f acing and ending of the Majesty of Set. It becomes the task of the aspirant to Xem to not hesitate or relax in the first steps of the new Initiation. The Elect must Will to Work, to turn their Magic in on their Selves for the purpose of creating and changing into Higher Beings. Since there are few points of reference other"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"than ourselves, Set, and the Neters, it will be vital to eliminate fixed opinions, animosities, psychological or emotional crutches, and fear of the Unknown. When the aspirant has decided to Xeper towa rd Xem and has prepared the Self with an attitude of Initiation, that same aspirant is ready to stand befo re Ma'at and to weigh his heart against her Truth. This is not unlike standing before a \"magic mirror\" that reflects the true Being. This must be done as In itiation begins, and as a result of the Working, the state of Being will manifest Itself in nobility or imperfecti on. The Being will be seen as It is for that is Its Truth and Its position regarding Xem and Xeper. This is an important aspect of the first Key, and it will be used time and again with the other Keys which follow. These Keys will not teach; neither can Xem be taught. Xem must first be recognized, then realized, and finally actualized by each aspi ring Magician. Not all sh all understand and not because they cannot, but because they shall choose not to understand. Understanding accompanies the desire to Work toward Xem, to Xeper. Ma'at is apparent to those who Willingly stand before her, for her concern is with the heart and its balance. Each aspirant must Will his Work of Xeper. Those who do not Xe per will be as blind to Xem as they are to Ma'at. To initiate an understanding of Xem and Xem's implications, it is vital to learn with the intelligence of the heart, which sh all in turn teach the intellect a new language. It is a language of higher Being, of philosophy and Magic. Its fo rms are the symbols of essential thought and the art of the inner eye. To begin learning with the intell igence of the heart, it is necessary to change the mental outlook and the normal way of thinking. Not al l knowledge pertains to the first three dimensions or the mundane world, and neither can the language of higher Being be purely translated into mundane concepts. Before the learning process begins, there must be a starting point. There can be no answer to anything unless first there is a question. The ques tion, to give a valuable answer, must come from the heart and not from the intellect. It should also be known that the knowledge gained and the benefit thereof will be limited to the intensity with which it was aspired toward. Therefore, the significance of the question must be contemplated with wisdom, which also is of the heart. The question must be a quest for knowledge and a quest ion in which the entire Will is concentrated and the Self is conscious. Only an answer can make a question possible; therefore, every question c ontains its own answer. Thus it was that Xem came to be pronounced; thus it is that Xem shall be known. Not unlike The Diabolicon , many of the secrets of Xem are cl oaked in myths -- but of ancient Egypt (Khem) rather than of the Hebrews. And so it is to Khem that some of Xem's initiates shall frequently turn. Their intention will be to strip away the veil which hides the mysteries beyond. This veil is extremely complex and conf using, and that fact only strengthens the importance of learning the language of Xem, th at language which can only be learned with the intelligence of the heart and which must be preceded by quest ion."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"The frequent concentration on Khem by Xem's s cavengers does not imply an attempt by them to rebuild Khem. Xem is a continuance and not a reversion to anything that has gone before. Instead, the concentration there is for the ta king apart of Khem, stone by stone and myth by myth, to finally reveal the secrets of Khem's or igin -- Xem. This shall also be done so that Xem might continue where it left off. Uniting th e magical past and future within Xem shall be part of Xeper. To embark upon this quest as Egyptologists have done will afford only mundane/historical data and information. While that information is useful, it is not the essence of the quest. Knowledge and understanding is the pur pose of this particular quest. The quest for the secret knowledge can only be made by Magicians (t hrough magical Work) and Philosophers (through the higher senses or wi sdom). So it is that the quest will go beyond Egyptology and the popular sciences (which are la rgely superficial) into the very essence of these: Xem and metaphysics. The quest for each initiate must be two-fol d, and will resemble putting together a great metaphysical/multi-dimensional puzzle. First, the usable pieces must be found from a universe of sources and then placed together. The ne twork of the pieces is just as important as the whole. To complicate this even more, Xem is only as it Becomes. What Xem will be is obscured to the individual initi ate, limited by their understanding, effort, level of Being, and of course, time and space. This brings up the second aspect of the quest which should be quite obvious. The Elect must raise their own states of Being to new levels constantly, and just as constantly maintain the highest level of Being attaine d. Thus, there is an internal and external que stion occurring simultaneously, each making the other possible -- each raising the other. It is vital to note that the process is not automatic just because one is Setian. The process will only work for those Elect who Work. Xem a nd the levels of Being are ever unknown until attained. It should not be thought that th e quests are limited to ancient Egypt, for there are keys all around and throughout the times of mankind. But mo re important than where the keys are found is the knowledge of how to use them once they have been found. For those who would know, let their eyes and ea rs turn inward to seek their question. Let them learn the language of Being so that that same Being might recognize Xem through Ma'at. The only truth is that of BEING, but to evolve that Being one must know their own Self. One cannot BE otherwise ordered in and of their Self. One cannot chart the way through Xeper if they do not know where they are at present -- which changes constantly. Those who shall elect to undertak e this monumental Work to r ealize and actualize Xem, and who shall recognize the Self, a nd who are determined to Beco me and Be what they are Become, shall also be ready to ta ke the step that separates but doe s not divide. And that step is Initiation into Xem. "},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":" The Book of Opening the Way: Key # 2 Xem is not an organization that one might consid er joining, and yet it has/will have an order and orders. Just what these are depends on what the initiates create with their Wills. Certainly these cannot be perceived from a three-dime nsional perspective, nor can/should Xem be created by any other than those w ho are initiated into Xem's mysteries and secrets. Xem is an abstraction which the Elect shall attempt to manife st and then transform. There are internal or hidden keys and external or mundane keys, esot eric and exoteric clues which must be used, but before these keys can be used to unlock the secrets, one must take a great step in personal evolution. This step is conscious and willed and is called Initiation. This in itiation is an ordeal of change. The initiation was shown in the original Xem Working as the hall of judgment, where the heart of the aspirant was being weighed against Ma'at's feather. Failure of the heart to be in balance with truth resulted in the aspirant being hande d back to Osiris. Aspiration or good intentions are insufficient to Xeper. Xeper is never a re laxed Will, and only Xepe r can transform Being. Xem gives direction to Xeper, and in itiation into Xem ensures balance. \"The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance...\" (1) Thus the judgment/initiation vision. Each aspira nt must pass through to Xem, and being called Setian is no guarantee of passa ge. One must BE Setian. \"Set is the leader only of Higher Man.\" (2) This statement is strongly supported in Th e Book of Coming Forth by Night. The idea of judgment should not be confused with right ha nd path systems or ph ilosophy that speak of moralism and altruisms, etc., for these have nothing to do with Ma'at. Initiation is the Pylons to Xem which open or block the way to that which is beyond. It is a step of Xeper, and one that can only be appr oached with deliberati on. To some it may seem unimportant, ludicrous, or even ominous, but it is the only entrance to Xem. \"Higher man must conquer fear\" is the first challenge of the Xem Working , and likewise for one considering initiation. One ma y feel arrogantly secure an d brave in the face of the familiar, but confronting one's Self can be a merciless ordeal; and having seen the Self (with its illusions of what it perceives is) against Ma 'at's feather (that which truly is) can be very sobering, to say the least. Here it is that the ordeal of initiati on causes change. The aspirant is confronted with the challenge of constructive transf ormation or regression, which can only be Classification: V2 - A17.2 - 2 Author: Ronald K.

The Black Flame is acutely out of place in the Osirian realm, and therefore the one who tries to regress ha s only two alternatives: 1) extin guish the Black Flame or 2) kindle that Flame and conquer the Will. (3) It could be said that, among other things, initiatio n is a shield against impurities being further incorporated into Xeper and becoming part of th e magical framework of Xem. In this respect it serves the individual a nd the Majesty of Set. There is no method of initiation pr escribed for the Order of Set into Xem, for true initiation must be provoked and occur within the indivi dual aspirant consciously and Willfully. The Order of Anubis will provide initiat ion facilities and assistance at Xemset for those wishing to go through a planned ordeal, (4) but those who prefer to go it al one can create their own ordeal using this key as a guide to what must transpire. Those approaching Xem through their own evoluti on will recognize the signals that will call them to initiation. Only those who have conque red fear should provoke th e ordeal, as stated before. The call to initiation is impossible to not recognize, for it comes as a longing, an inner need demanding to be fulfilled. It shall seem as a need for inner action, and there will be an unceasing impulse to force an esoteric issue. The aspirant will feel an obsession to know truth and to Be. This will be unignorable. During the initiation, which may take one evening or one year, the Being calls upon its Self to reveal itself to its Self. This shall require an awakened state from which one may see the truth of Self balanced against Ma'at, and this must be Willed. One's inner vision is carried well beyond normal limitations, and the aspirant may be forced to see a terrifying yet awesome glimpse of man, Xem, the Neters , the Work ahead, as well as th e fate for failure -- and his own relation to each of these. It is again a journey into the very e ssence of Ma'at and the Self in regards to her. The Being will definitely feel itself in the presence of the Old Ones. The Gates of Xem are opened to those who would see, and shall not be closed again. Initiation is the directing of one's own Powers of Darkne ss inward to open the ga tes of Self. Here the aspirant may find the true source of and answer to his question. Through initiation the aspirant can be born into a new dimension of Bei ng. It is Being that was not. Here awakens a Conscious Intelligence that recognizes its own Ma'at and Freedom. The aspirant should also have a glimpse into the Source of the magical current which is passing through mankind, as well as the Self ahead of itself -- the path of Xeper extending toward what can be. An important part of initiation is the call to th e Neter with which the successful initiate will Work (this may or may not be th e result of telesmatic construction). The importance is in the function of the Neter and not in the name. The Neter will be recognized by its nature. If the aspirant has already established or recognized a strong affinity toward a particular Neter, the reason or Working relationship could quite possibl y unfold. More on this shall be discussed in a key concerning the Neters and their signi ficance to the initiates and to Xem. The initiation into Xem is the beginning of the actual quest for the Unknown and Nameless One. The Work is the preparation for and c oncludes only with the Great Work -- which in itself is but a new beginning, having fulfilled the challenge set forth in the Statement of"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Leviathan. (5) For this reason it would not be inappr opriate to call the initiates of Xem \"Alxemists.\" Initiation is the preparation for the Work toward finding the Philosopher's Stone -- Xem! Initiation then is the giant step toward true und erstanding of the mysteries and secrets of Xem. Xem's foundation is in the Abst ract. To the uninitiated, Xem will always be veiled in mystery and will seem to them very much like the S econd Foundation did to outsiders in Asimov's Foundation Trilogy . And they won't be entirely wrong. As was true of the Orders and Temples of an cient Egypt and Greece, there must be two vital aspects of Xem: the known and the secret, betw een which is the bridge of initiation. The process or system leading to that bridge is al ready established, and shal l be the subject of an entire key to follow. The Daemons are, the Daemons were, and the Daemons shall be again. They came, and we are here; they sleep, and we watch for them. They shall sleep, and we shall die, but we shall return through them. We are th eir dreams, and they shall awaken.

The components are the TS, the Temple of Set, the Order of Set, the Initiatory Degrees, the Executive Director, the Council of Nine, the High Priesthood, Majestic Man or King/Pharaoh, and Xem. The TS is the manifestation of the Temple of Set in the temporal or mundane world. (1) It is the administrative/legal/corporate vehicle in wh ich the Elect may move as a body of Setians among mankind. It is the TS that a potential Setian \"joins\" initi ally to pursue his/her Magical aspirations. The TS is vital to the Work of th e Elect, for it provides the protocol, the bylaws, the treasury, etc., without which the Elect w ould be constantly struggling with mundane \"ways and means\", thereby forfeiting valuable time and effort that should be spent in Setamorphosis (both organiza tionally and individually). The Executive Director TS is an extremely impor tant figure in the TS, because he/she sees to it that the TS operate s efficiently and smoothly. Without the Executive Director, the High Priest of Set and/or the Counc il of Nine would become bogged down with administrata of a non-Magical nature, and the TS would become JU ST another organizatio n. It is not difficult to understand why the Scribes in old Khem had such a prominent position in both the temples and the royal house. The Temple of Set is the Magical organization wh ich is reflected in the temporal world as the TS It is the abstraction behind th e manifestation. It is the TRUE House of Set. It is also true that each of the Elect are in themselves a Temp le of Set, since they house the Black Flame. It could be said that the collective Temple of Set is macrocosmic, and that the individual Elect is the microcosmic Temple of Set. Just as a si ngle cell in a physical body carries the genetic code to the entire body – so it is with the Temple of Set and Its Initiates. The whole is the sum of its parts, and its parts refl ect the whole. This in no way is intended to impl y the absorption of individual Being or the surrender of unique iden tity or of free Will. Ra ther this is indicative of some common denominators among only the Elect which include individual Being and Will, as well as the Essence of Set. This is also indicative of the absolute uniqueness of the Temple of Set. Within the TS, the High Priest of Set is the corporate president, and it is he who determines the policy that the Executive Director will carry out; but the High Priest is more precisely the Functional head of the Temple of Set in its me taphysical reality. It is the task of the High Priest of Set to perceive and administer the Will of Set within the Temple of Set. This is so that the Elect can move with the Magical curr ent of the Aeon as it winds its way through the future. The Council of Nine is the \"heart\" of the Temp le of Set, which advises the High Priest by Its \"Sense of Set\" or Ma'at. The Nine could be compared to the higher emotional center because the Council advises by higher Senses, feelings, an d intuitions. These fee lings are not to be confused with the petty and unbala nced emotions of our lower human cousins, for such advice would then be unreliable at best, and the Elec t would fall to the depths of human games and politics. The Council of Nine, then, is the \"reacti ve\" principle to the \"act ive\" principle of the High Priest of Set; and the two cr eate a principle of Balance. The Order of Set consists of all III° Initiates, and is the \"Hypostyle\" or Inner Temple of Set. Only Initiates of the Order are actual member s of the corporation. The Lay Members are the \"Peristyle\" or Outer Temple of Set, and are I° and II°."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Xem is the Naos/Inner Sanctum or \"Holy of Holies\" of the Temple of Set, but just what these mean is the subject for further discussion -- as is Majestic man. The entire Magical complex is separated into two basic aspects – which while they are separate, are not divided. The two aspects have been re ferred to as the \"Two Lands.\" The Two Lands are symbols of our dual planes of Being: visible /invisible, light/darkness, manifest/abstract, Ra/Set. HarWer is intenti onally not mentioned as was HarWer not included in the original Xem Working. The placing of HarWer within our Setian Philo sophy has been guesswork at best. HarWer has been regarded by some Setians as our own \"D evil.\" HarWer has been theorized into physics by other Setians, and by still other Setians Ha rWer is seen as the natural order of the Universe. However, none of these ideas have re ally appealed to the Elect's Sense of Set because they were not entirely true. To make a rather profound answer on this subj ect of HarWer, there are two questions that need to be asked: 1) Who/What are we? 2) Who/What is HarWer? 1) In Geneset , Magus Michael A. Aquino points out that man is a creature within the natural order, but that he need not be subject to the Great Law. Man's intelligence has made him \"completely inconsistent with every other life-form on this planet\" and \"with the known laws of evolution\" and \"with the Great Law\" itsel f. Man can \"think creatively, spontaneously, abstractly, and aesthetic ally.\" He can \"conceive , design, and construct non-natural concepts, arguments, processes, and objects.\" And he can \"distinguish between the natural and the nonnatural, something that would be a logical impossibility if the human brain were itself entirely natural.\" The Diabolicon in each Daemonic Statement discusses this very curious creature – man – and his past/present/future reason for being. It seems that man has both natural and unnatural aspects, and that while he belongs entirely to neither aspect, he is not entirely free of either aspect. Instead man stands with a foot in each of the Two Lands (which are opposites). \"So, if humans are freakish things which have devel oped independently of the Great Law, why?\" (2) What about his curious and dual Being makes hi m so important to the Prince of Darkness? The answers are within the questions. 2) According to The Book of Coming Forth by Night , HarWer is Set's Opposite Self – a strange and fitful presence. HarW er was Set when Set was once part of the Cosmos \"and could achieve identity only by becoming what the Cosmic Order was not.\" HarWer therefore is NOT the Cosmic Order. HarWer cancelled the imbalance, (3) \"leaving a Void in which true Creation could take form as Set.\" HarWer was CREATED so that Set might define himself. Also, note that HarWer MUST EXIST while Set exists. Set has made reference to his \"Gifted Race\" a nd to his \"Elect\", which automatically implies that there is another race. The word \"race\" means a distinct group of people -- NOT mankind. It seems that there are both Elect/Gifted and non-Elect/non-Gift ed, but what determines the difference between them? Philosophy does not ma ke a \"race\". The difference lies in the word \"gifted\". The Gift of Set is the Black Flame, that which burns in its own freedom. Only those who have been given the Black Flame are among the Elect or Gifted Race. The Elect have sprung out of mankind and are among mankind, yet are distinct from mankind as a whole."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"While the Black Flame makes an initial difference in the Elect, it will do no more than that unless it is used , and it can only be used through Will, wh ich must be controlled/\"conquered\". The Gift unused is literally useless; and without consciousness of its unique Essence, it will cease to burn. To kindle its power without contro lled Will may cause it to consume the Black Magician who houses the Black Flame. The Elect, by using the Flame's transforming powers, have begun Setamorphosis/Xeper/Willed evolution. As we walk the Two Lands, how strange and fitful we must appear in the realm of light with our Dark aspects and likewise in the realm of Darkness with our Light aspects -- we who are both, and neither. But why are the Elect so important (like HarWer) to Set? A clue is locked within the ancient symbolism of Set and HarWer uniting the Two Lands. This symbolizes the Great Work in Xem, but it is not the result of the Great Work. It is the fusion of the Principles of Light and Darkness, matter and spirit, etc. The result is not a combination of th e two, but rather a new thing altogether. This Great Work is as delicat e as trying to fuse matter and anti-matter, and just as dangerous, hence the warning of Belial in The Diabolicon . Those Elect who have begun this Great Work are Xem and are Coming Into Being (a new kind of Being) as gods whose Names are unknown. Having completed the Great Work, they will no longer be Xem, for they will have transformed into the ne w Beings or gods whose Names are no longer unknown. They will have beheld Leviathan. The non-Elect cannot participate in our Work b ecause of his fear of the Unknown, lack of Will, lack of conscious intelligence, and the non-existence of the Black Flame within him. He is symbolized by the Neter Ra – principle of finite man who is born, makes his way across his finite life, has dominion over his finite realm, is majestic in his finite accomplishments, but eventually grows old and dies, cycle after cycle, aeon after aeon. He cannot escape the grip of the Great Law – the cyclic pr inciple of birth/life/death. The Diabolicon states that the natural order will continue its cycling until it freezes in absolute concretion which is the exact opposite of chaos. As this non-Elect man has ch osen to ignore the teachings of his own imagination, the reality of his own alienness, and the proof of his potential, so is he victim to the illusion of impossibility, and, what is worse, he has grown content with it. And man was long satisfied to measure himself with in this limit, for he was intoxicated by his ability to harness the forces of the Cosmos to his whim. But Astaroth said, Close not thy eyes having seen only this much, for, were thou to br ing all the systems of God to thy use, still would thy comprehension be bounded by the limits of these laws... ... Throughout the Universe hath th e once single Will of God b een succeeded by the balance of perfect opposition, wherein the forces of the Angels of Hea ven and those of the Daimons of Hell act to mutual frustration, serving in con cert only to uphold the gr eat barrier of Will between order and chaos. And man is the child of imbalance, who shall resolve the issue between Heaven and Hell, and who, unmatched by racial antithesis, shall transcend the rule of the order of God and establish the et ernal freedom of the Satanic Will. And I said, Not through thy physical and philosophica l sciences art thou to achieve this thing, for thy mind and Will must be trained anew in empirical conception. Man must create his own order independent of all external imposition. An d not until he masters this power may he aspire to the end of his Satanic evolution. (4) For this Key, the important things to remember from the above statement are a) man being the child of imbalance, b) man shall resolve th e issue between Heaven and Hell or the Two"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Lands, c) man must create his OWN order (\"...yet am ordered in and of my Self\") and man must master his own power. What power? I am Belial, who bring to thee the third great key of Hell, by whose power ye shall confound all the laws of Heaven and Ea rth. Before thee shall chaos fall , and thou shalt wield for thyself the great mysteries of the macrocosmos. I spea k to thee of that which is called the Black Magic, for it is true spawn of that great Black Flame which fir st brought thy Wi ll to life long ages ago. (5) Only man can hope to perfect Being, for man is the only Being of both the Great Law and conscious intelligence -- the Two Lands. But man needs help to accomplish the Great Work. Set cannot stop the direction of the natural order wit hout assuming its pla ce -- else all would go back to chaos. Only man can resolve the i ssue, but not just any man... only those who are worthy to be Elect or to receive the Black Flame. Long ago Set experimented (Magically) with a na tural creature that it might perhaps do what Set could not, and man came into Being. This man was a composite of opposite aspects, but his natural or physical aspects we re still subject to the Great Law. This new man was innocent and open-minded, and received teaching through his Sense of Set. This strange new creature at first did not cower from its otherness a nd welcomed knowledge of its new-found Self. Soon it was seen that knowledge alone was not enough for this creature of dual aspects and the Work ahead that ONLY he could perform, and so to the most advanced of mankind Set gave of his OWN Essence, and within them the Black Flame ignited. After a time and with the Power that burned with in, those men who had been Elect to receive this Black Flame founded temples which were (bot h in essence and in structure) consecrated to Set for teaching and protecting the mysteries of Being and preparation for use of the Gift of Set. The temples were schools based on In itiation, and NOT houses of worship. Out of the temple system, the Great Ones even tually evolved. The Great Ones had become Beings higher than man, and they were awed and respected as gods. So great was their Understanding and their unique perception and th eir Being, that they had actually Become Principle of their Knowledge. Each Principle Wo rking in concert with the other Principles toward the Great Work was the \"Function\" of the Principle. Principle + Function = Neter (a Working Form of a Purpose). As the Great Ones did Function according to the Principle, they took their names accordingly; hence the name s of the Neters did Come Into Being. (Remember that Function occurs within the colle ctive effort toward the collective evolution; Work is the individual effort toward individual evolution.) That they might pass on Knowledge of thei r Principle and Function, the Great Ones established their own orders. Within their own orders, they taught according to the understanding of their initiates, for they were not easily comprehended. Their Beings evolved to such extent that their Knowledge had to be passed down through the highest initiates of their orders to the lowest. And all of the orders remained true as aspects of the Order of Set, which was the body of Elect dedicated to the Setia n Purpose. They were all within the Temple of Set, complementing the Great Order as Principles functioning in multiple stages of evolving being."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"After more time, the Temple had formed a civ ilization based on Ma'at, Xeper, and under the guidance of Set through the Great Ones -- Xem.

This great on e would manifest the Principle of Set in the realm of natural order (Light). He would pers onify the Majesty of Se t, and he would be a living symbol of the highest form of Xeper(a) in the Two Lands. He would be the symbol of the Elect Working the Great Work with Set. He was Great Har or Hor; HarWer -- the Principle of Majestic Man. With the Elect in Xem, symbolized by HarWer, Set might fuse the Two Lands and accomplish the Great Work. The traditional rule of HarWer upon the Earth (in Khem) was through Pharaoh, and his title was the Living Horus. He wore the Crown of the Two Lands, which to the uninitiated into the Order of Set meant Upper and Lower Khem. Ha rWer/Pharaoh's function was to balance the affairs of Light and Darkness in Xem. In time this great magical Function became no more than a political office occupied by a mortal w ho wore, held, and sat upon sacred symbols that had lost true meaning. ...Because in those ancient days all did not go well. Man and priesthood became political and corrupt when left on their own to see how we ll they would do with what they had learned. Seeing that man had a good deal more to learn before he w ould be mature enough to commit himself entirely to the Great Work, Xem and the true Temple of Set made preparations and vanished into the disguise of the Amon Cu lt. (Appropriately, Amon means \"hidden\" -- compare to the hieroglyphic \"Xem\".) This gave th e Order of Set time to wrap their secrets in myth and occult (which also means \"hidden\") puzzles, which could then pass fragmentarily and obscurely through time, until the time of the Purification was past and the Work could begin again. Xem remains secret until established. The Or der of Anpw will come about and provide the tools for the Work ahead. The Dark and Hidde n aspects of Anubis are now important, and their reasons can be seen. He who wears the Double Crown is needed also for the Work that is to be done. Ra is man and HarWer is Exalted/Majestic Man. He who wears the Crown of the Two Lands exists and is Michael Aquino. He must be supported for ther e must be an order within the realm wherein the Elect are found. Xem must not fade and be ended. Xem is the Philosopher's Stone for Xem will change and Know its Being. The old world fades behind Xem to exist no more. We are those who define and shape. Reason will be bor n and a new world recognized. (6) In the Year X A.S., Michael A. Aquino was ceremonially crowned with the Double Crown and entrusted with the Crook and Flail. Thes e are not symbols of the High Priesthood, but they are symbols of Majestic/Royal or exalted Man. He who bears them in Ma'at is HarWer manifest.

The learning of this new language will be more like remembering than gathering new data, as several of the Elect will already attest. To make this clear, go back to the first time you read The Book of Coming Forth by Night , and recall the first impression it made. Was it not almost a feeling of rememberi ng? The same should be true of this language of which I write. In a similar vein, how many times have we reread BoCFbN , and in doing so found a new twist to something we thought so familiar. Th at is because that book contains a good deal more between its covers than what has yet be en Understood -- some of which I shall try to point out as I continue to define Xem. Another text that ha s a wealth of important things to Understand is The Diabolicon , even though the symbolis ms are \"cloaked.\" Symbolism is the key, and one must learn to THINK in symbolism (of which both texts are greatly composed). Symbolism is a visible fo rm of abstract (magical and philosophical) principles, qualities, and func tions, awakening within us an Understanding (consciousness) of Being and of an already possessed knowledge co ntained in our true Being.

Symbolism is not an exactly new language to th e Elect to be sure, for it can be found in use since the year I A.S., and we ha d to use it in various forms to Work even the simplest magic. But until the pure form of the Pentagram of Set was discussed in BoCFbN , the symbols used were not really directly approached, and were therefore rather loosely interpreted to any meaning we wished to attach to them. Only one symbol other than the Baphomet (to my knowledge) was given truly serious thought, and that was the Trapezoid due to LaVey's fascination with it. And then we all found out that even the Baphomet was a corruption of a pure symbol. And this was an important matter to the Prince of Darkness, because he wanted the Pentagram restored to Its or iginal and pure form. I'm sure that this was not because of Set's just disliking the design of the Baphomet. Instead I woul d suspect that in an impure form, the Pentagram cannot be Underst ood as the Truth that it symbolizes. If symbols are representations of truths, then it becomes the responsibility of the Elect to Understand them. Only by Understanding them can they serve us as a language, so that we can accurately communicate among ourselves as we continue to evolve. Even more important though is the process that occurs within us as individuals as we work toward and discover their hidden meanings. How does one unveil the truth of a symbol? I have said that one must be taught symbolic meanings by one's own heart, which means th at we already possess the knowledge of the symbolic. But, this knowledge is locked deep within, and so our task is to bring what is known to consciousness. And this is why reaching Understanding seems so much like remembering. When we have found one of our questions, th is same question will be converted into symbolism deep within our minds, and when we follow the question within, the symbolism will expand and bring before the mind's eye (inner eye/third eye) a vast complex of abstract, magical, intuitive states of Being with qualities, associations, and relationships which while they are experienced – they can never be truly explained. The degree of Understanding will be determined by the heart – NOT by the intellect , therefore one must learn to allow the symbolic to enter the consciousness and unite the inner Being with it, unhampered by the mundane intellect. When this Understanding has o ccurred, then and only then can the intellect identify with it, even though it will ever be at odds to explain it. On the other hand however, every Setian who \"experiences\" the Pentagram n eeds no further explanation than just seeing the symbol, because Its Truth has become a part of them. To anyone who has not, It will ever be a five-pointed upside-down star -- regardless of explanations offered. With all of this in mind, I shall discuss the Stele of Xem . To do so I shall have to employ my intellect (which shall be at odds to explain it). It will be up to you to make the symbolisms 'live', for this too is a vital part of Initiation. The Stele of Xem is both the cover and preface of The Book of Opening the Way, and is composed entirely of symbolism. No symbol has been used in the Stele for the sake of art; rather art has been employed for the sake of sym bolism. Not only is each individual symbol in itself essential to Understanding the whole symbo lism, but the network or relationship of each symbol with the others is equally important."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"The stele manifests in symbolism the formula, \"Xeper ir Xem.\" The upper portion of the Stele is framed by plumes of Ma'at, indicating that what is known therein must be perceived in Truth or Understood. One can only Understand th at which has become a part of their own reality, \"The only Truth is that of Being.\" The bases of the two plumes are touching the Se t-headed Uas scepters which face each other. A scepter is a symbol of author ity, and in Khem a stick or staff was a \"medu\" or symbol of a Word. Closer to the intended meaning would be \"authority of the Word.\" Since the Uas scepter specifically has a Set-head mounted on one end and the bifurcated tail on the other end, one can easily interpret this as \"authority of the Word of Set.\" The sap which once flowed through the staff is re placed with the Will of Set wh ich flows into the Two Lands. Accordingly, one who carries th e Uas also holds its meaning. On the Stele there are two Uas scepters whic h face each other and frame several lines of hieroglyphs; the scepter on the le ft issues forth the Word \"X em,\" while the scepter on the right limits the same. The reason for this is as simplistic as it is obvious. Xem is a goal with not an end, but rather a new beginning as its Purpose. Xem has been compared to the Philosopher's Stone, and not without good reason. An alchemist labors dilige ntly to create his 'stone,' but not for possession of the stone itse lf -- rather for its transformational properties. The same holds true for the Initiate in his quest for Xem, as will be s een later in this Key. Between the two scepters is the Neter Anubis, re presented as a Black Jackal. In this form the Neter is pure Principle and entirely abstract. No motion is suggested, for the Neter is not yet manifested. Around the Neter are hier oglyphic transliterations of the IAM Manuscript which were first written down in English in the year I A.S., and veiled from Understanding until the Utterance of Xem. The secrets of the IAM rema ined locked in the Neter until the time of Anubis' manifestation of Recogn ition as Opener of the Way. The transliteration of the IAM from English in to hieroglyphic spelling as well as the ancient tongue became a very important task for me almost immediately following S. Solstice XIII. Without the skill and knowledge of Priestess Sa ndy Sarris it may never have been completed. To her, we owe many thanks for her many hours a nd days of dedication on that project -- even though she says that it was a labor of love for what she was doing. The result of that project (other than the obvious finished product) is that the very words that are used in the IAM have come alive and have taken a meaning that English simply could not provide. I am convinced that the project of transliterati on was absolutely vital to Understanding the manuscript. And now, because of that work, the symbolism can be translated back into English with a purer and more comprehensive meaning. Ironically, the English words do not change, for the English already used is as precise as the language will permit. Both renderings of the IAM are included in The Onyx Tablet . (1) In looking at the top portion of the Stele of Xem , please take note of the fact that every entity is shown in a walking posture, indicating a definite motion of th e Principles of the entity. It would be a mistake to regard this motion as necessarily involving Time and Space. It would not be a mistake to regard this motion as the abstract process of Setamorphosis. The Stele is read from left to right, hence Set is the first entity with whom we must concern ourselves. An initiate embarking upon the path to Xem must receive the Gift of Set. This Gift is only given to those who have been considered by Set as his own Elect, and then only after"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"they have ventured into the Darkness via their own Will and established a personal relationship with the Prince of Da rkness. Because of the nature of this unique Gift, an initial transformation occurs within the new Priest(ess) of Set, and the initiate must adjust to a new quality/condition which cannot be quit. That quality/condition is absolute freedom. But the figure of Set is upon a dark base which only elevates him slightly above the next figure which is the initiate. This shows Set's own accessibility as a \"friend\" and his close relations hip with the Elect. \"Lo, I pass near to thee, I pass near to thee.\" Set's gaze is upon the spine and skull of the init iate for these are the centers of the Fiery Essence and the Temple of Being. His arms are upraised as he gives of his own Essence. His garb is dark for obvious reasons. The initiate is the next figure, and he walk s upon a thick black line which is the Darkness or the abstraction of his own Being. He wears a light garment which shows the realm in which his semblance or manifestation must exist, bu t around his waist is a dark band which is his umbilical, for he is also a child of Darkness. A dark nemes covers his upper vertebrae and his skull which is divided at the crown by a hea dband -- indicating phi quality. Upon his pineal gland is the hooded Serpent One, the force of essential fire, she \"who twines the spine and rests her head upon the brow.\" Her trailing body nea tly separates the two halves of the brain. A circular disk rests upon the heart of the in itiate, but the Pentagram which would normally be in the center of the disk hovers freely a bove and before him -- indicating his freedom and the conditions of his path. He has entered the Inner Temple, the Setian Realm. The Pentagram before him \"shines forth\" in Its Principle of creation and change. The initiate is reminded and charged not to succumb to rest or preservati on. He must conquer all fear of the Unknown and the ever changing. Within the magic of the Pent agram is the reality and the proportion to the Gates ahead. The Pentagram is his perspective of Ba lance as he journeys deep within his Self. In his right hand, the Initiate grasps the symbol for Neter. A thorough discussion of the Neters and their Setian significance will be the subject of discussion later, but for now let's say that the initiate has a specific Neter with whom he shall Function in the cooperative effort. His right hand is his Functional aspect while his left hand is his Worki ng aspect, and the two (while related) are quite differe nt to the individual initiate. Hi s Work is his effort in his personal Setamorphosis, and is unique to himself. The result of his Work however may serve all of the Elect, and in that respect becomes Functional. Now, his Work will usually reflect one or another aspect of his Neter, as well as his relationship with that Neter, but his Function will directly reveal the Principle of the Neter. The LEFT hand of the Initiate is grasping the RIGHT hand of Anubis who is the Guide in this aspect. (It is not difficult to s ee how Anubis' role as Initiatory Guide became bastardized into Guide of the dead, when one considers the nature of this path.) So here we have the left hand of the initiate which is his pe rsonal initiation, guided by the Functional right hand of Anubis. On the Stele, we find Anubis shown in two ways: (1) as the \"Black Jackal\" and (2) anthropomorphically. Let's take a moment to cons ider both symbols, for in doing so it might help others in Understanding the Neters and possible relationships with them."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"#1. To appreciate the symbolism of Anubis as the \"Black Jackal,\" there are some Egyptological considerations to be made. First is that the canine that is commonly regarded as the Egyptian jackal as it is shown in the ancien t art forms is not a true jackal. Canis lupister, the real jackal of Egypt, has a tu fted short tail and yellowish gr ay fur. In fact they strongly resemble the American coyote, except for colo ring which varies in both species a little. Jackals also look somewhat like an enlarg ed fox, and sometimes display near feline characteristics. They are basically nonpredatory, as they prefer carrion (whi ch is a clue to the principle of Anubis). They are mostly noctu rnal, timid, extremely agile and supple, and preferably nonsocial animals. It seems that the Black Jackal is actua lly a composite canine image for the Neter Anubis/Upuat. The image is shown with such f eatures as the long pointed ears of a fox or a jackal, the tufted tail of a wolf or jackal, a nd the short black coat of the wild dog of Egypt. The obvious question is why a composite image, ra ther than just selecting one canine (such as a wolf or a real jackal) to sy mbolize Anubis? It is because no t one canine could symbolize the Principles of the Neter. And this answer is important, because it toppl es any notion that the Neters were born out of the sym bol or anything as crude as \"ani mal worship.\" The truth is that the symbol must fit the Neter, and NOT the re verse. So various characteristics of canine orders were used to define the various asp ects of the Black Jackal, because the Neter has multiple Functions which come under basicall y two names -- Anpw (Anubis) and Upuat. Often these two Functions were shown as separate entities (whi ch still confuses Egyptologists), but both names bel ong to the same Neter and identify a particular Functional aspect. To grasp the Principle one must first know that we are, in discussing the Black Jackal, simultaneously discussing alXemical processes. To further point this out, let's take a look at the purely \"jackal\" aspect. In doing, so remember that we are seeking the metaphysical reality of the symbol. A jackal is a carrion eater which rips the body into pieces, buries the pieces, and l eaves them alone until th ey rot. In eating the putrefied flesh, the jackal changes it into lif e-giving food, and this the jackal does by its special digestive process. \"What would be poi sonous for almost all ot her creatures in him becomes an element of life through a transforma tion of elements which are bringing out this decomposition.\" (2) Hence the jackal function is the di gestion/transformational process. Another symbol of the jackal or jackal sy mbolism is the hieroglyphic 'sab' which means judgment or the 'judge'. This is because \"in eati ng, it (the jackal) perfor ms a precise, innate discrimination, separating out the elements capab le of transformation and future evolution from the elements that are untransmutable within their present cycle.\" (3) The jackal instinctively knows the precise time that he must devour the carrion or it will become indigestible. This is symbolic of the in itiatory phases of the Elect which offer either transformation or irreversible chaos, and of which I wrote on the first page of Key #1. It is important to know each of us have a micr ocosmic version of each of the Neters within us, making us each a pantheon – even though we individually may manifest specific single Neters. This shall be dealt with in more detail in a later Key, but it is important to bring it up now to help clarify the paragr aph above. It is the jackal f unction which identifies the exact process and timing of the Principle of Xeper in the Aeon."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"To appreciate and use the magical functions of the Black Jackal (or any other Neter) one must Understand their functiona l aspects, for therein is revealed their use and part in the Great Work of Xem. #2. The top section of the Stele shows Anubis as having the body of a man and the head of the Black Jackal. This symbolism defines the mani festation of the Principle of Anubis as was recognized by Set on XIII:11.11. In Egyptian art we can find Anubis shown both as a Black Jackal and anthropomorphically, but this was not done by whim or accident or for aesthetics. One can, in studying the ancient art, easily see that few things were done for aes thetics, in fact it woul d at first glance appear that they deliberately tried to do things that are aesthetically wrong, but that is not the case either. In his book on sculpture, Frank Eliscu sa ys this of design: \"Standards of taste and ideals of beauty have changed continuously over the ages, but the tenets of good design remain firm and are the foundati ons of all art.\" Then we can turn around and read of various Egyptologists reporting that the ancient Egyptians seemed at times almost in defiance of design principles and tenets in their architecture and other art fo rms. Yet who is left unmoved by their superb craftsmanship, and by an almost uncomfortable feeling of those ancient artists having struck some distant but familiar chord within? As the chord chimed within, I personally be gan to Understand that the anthropomorphic symbolism defines the Neter being manifest in functional form through an agent (with Anubis that agent is myself). The neter actua lly defines itself through the agent. What does Anubis have to do with Set? The Nete rs are aspects of the Ageless Intelligence, yet each Neter is a Principle unto itself, enjoying wh at let's call for now -- co-consciousness, not unlike man with his several I's. Within each of us there is the True Being with its various aspects or interpretations/definitions of itself as it considers itself, and as it relates to the environment around it. Soon, if these aspects become functional enough, they will actually acquire qualities, characteristics, and even aspects of themselves. It must be remembered however that these are aspects of the True Be ing and NOT the Being itself. The problem in man is that he has not consciously created these aspects, nor is he master, i.e. ordered in and of his Self. Each 'I' aspect ha s become more or less an ent ity unto itself, and often these aspects pull against each other instead of es tablishing a co-consciousness and Working through and with a joint effo rt of Will toward the cr eation of a Self order. Linking with a Neter gives distinction to our ow n particular Setian Esse nce, and manifesting this Neter is in essence (no pun) manifesting an aspect of Set or a Principle of the Ageless Intelligence. So as not to confuse this with posse ssion, let me point out that this manifestation does not forfeit any part of our own Will or Being. We are merely bringing into our own realm the Functional relationships of Set with his Elect. Our indi vidual quests are to Xeper ir Xem. The Black Jackal headed man symbolizes the manifestation of the Neter Anpu/Apuat (Upuauat). The Working (left) hand of the entity holds al oft the Uas scepter before a Trapezoidal structure, and with the Authority of the Word the structure becomes a gate and the Way is Opened. The title of this aspect of th e Neter is \"The Opener of the Way\" or Apuat. This aspect is manifest through my Fifth De gree Work of Opening the Way to Xem. The Functional hand of the entity holds the left ha nd of the Initiate, and guides him through and"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"along the Way to Xem. This aspect of the Neter is \"The Guide and Escort,\" and is manifest through my Function as Hi gh Priest of Set. Once entered, the Trapezoid becomes a hall th rough which all aspirants to Xem must pass. This is the Hall of Judgment, and within it stan ds Ma'at, Neter of Truth and Justice. This particular Ma'at is the aspirant's individual Ma 'at or individual Truth, and her Function is to determine the Balance or imbalance of the Self who is being led thr ough initiation. If this Ma'at's feather is balanced by the Heart of the aspirant, then the aspi rant will recognize the macrocosmic Ma'at, for his own Ma'at will refl ect her. And then the Initiate may continue toward Xem; his own Truth is Understood. In Ma'a t's right hand is the Scales of Justice, for Justice is the activity of Trut h. In her left hand she holds th e Anx, which is offered to the Initiate who passes through. It is the Essence of his Being. Beyond this Hall is another gate which opens to a new chamber. Beyond the gate is the Scarabaeus, indicating that onl y the Becoming of what is be yond will bring it into Being. The Initiate who has reached this point has Come in to Being as a true god. The Initiate is now of the Order of Xepera as well as of the Order of Set, and here begins his Great Work. This chamber is the Naos, the \"Holy of Holies,\" the se cret Shrine of the gods (Old and New). This is the Realm of Xem. Above the Scarabaeus (or Xepera) is a cartouc he which is in the place of the dung-ball. A cartouche is the Shen symbol upon which is wr itten the hieroglyphic spe lling of a name -- in this case it is the name of the god who has Co me Into Being. Let me very modestly define a Shen as a \"mirror reflecting infinity.\" With that in mind I shall further say that this particular Shen is inscribed with (reflects), \"NETER XEM WHOSE NAME IS UNKNOWN.\" This cartouche then states that this god who has Come Into Being does not yet know his true Name; he is in his twilight. The next figure is atop a rather odd looking base which symbolizes the three main parts of the Temple of Set. Temple of Set here means bot h the Initiatory co-ope ration and the individual Initiate who is in himself a Temple of Set. The left side of the base shows a pylon (bexnt), and this is the mundane aspect of the Temple. This is the only part of the Temple that is seen from without, and it serves to allow or to block entry. This was th e first gate through which the Initiate had passed. The right foot of the figure (who is shown moving toward the Ini tiate) is supported by columns which compose the Peristyle or Outer Temple. This is the lay membership ... those from whom the Elect will be found ... t hose who prepare for the second gate. The left foot of the figure is supported by a black Trapezoidal st ructure which is the Hypostyle or Inner Temple. It is the Realm of Da rkness, the Order of Set. The second gate is the entrance to the Hypostyle, and the Work toward Xem occurs within. The figure is the god Xem. He is the true Be ing that has reached full potential. He has accomplished the Great Work, and has Become a new kind of Being. He is the one that has evolved from man the animal to Magician to R oyal Man to Divine Man. He is shown faceless, for none may know his Name -- not even himSelf until he has Become his Name. The symbolism of the beard on his ch in indicates his godhood. In his righ t hand he grasps a rolled and sealed papyrus upon which is written his Name and its hidden meaning. He extends the papyrus toward the approaching Initiate, for he is the Initiate ahead of his Self – awaiting"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"completion of the Great Work. His walking motion to ward the Initiate is as a reflection of the Initiate's transformation. He is the IAM. Upon the figure's head is a crown which is the symbol of the Naos, with its walls being two feathers of Ma'at; for it is the Great Work within which shall crown him upon his Coming Into Being. Upon completing the Great AlXemical Work, the figure will hand the Initiate the papyrus. Having read it, the In itiate and Xem will Be One a nd he shall know his Name. The dark column behind Xem blocks vision to that which is beyond, for what is beyond shall only be known by those who have Become Xem and found their Names. The left hand of Xem grasps the Anx, for he holds the true Essence of his Being. On several different occasions I have compar ed Xem to the Statement of Leviathan in The Diabolicon , and in doing so I was specifically re ferring to the transformation of the Black Flame into the glory of its perfection. It is inte resting to note that one of the definitions of Xem (according to both Budge and de Lubicz) is; \"a very hot fi re, burning intensely,\" and it was compared to the Setian fire! \"A power superior to man gave the primordial names to things in such a way that the names are necessarily right. The rightne ss of the names makes the nature of things visible. One can absolutely say that when the names are known, the things are equally well known.\" (PLATO) \"The sages of Egypt appear to me to have shown a consummate knowledge or a marvelous instinct when in order to reveal their wisdom to us, they did no t resort to letters to express words and statements representing sound a nd expressions but por trayed objects by 'Hieroglyphs' and in their mysteries symbolically assigned an emblem of its own to each of them. So each hieroglyph constituted a type of knowledge or wisdom and presented the thing visually as a synthesis without discursive concep tion or analysis. This synthetic idea was then reproduced in other signs that developed it, expressed it discursive ly, and enunciated the reasons why these things are made as they are when their beautiful arrangement arouses admiration.\" (PLOTINUS) \"There is no difference, as a matter of fact, between the texts called hi eroglyphs and most of the precepts of the Pythagoreans. \"There is nothing more charac teristic of Pythagorean philoso phy than the use of symbols, such as those employed in the celebration of the mysteries. It is a language that includes both silence and speech ... What is said is very cl ear and obvious to those who are used to this language; it is obscure and unintelligible only to the uninformed. The apparent meaning of these symbols is not the true one , but in it one must search for what they seem to conceal.\" (PLUTARCH) Footnotes 1. Ed note, Feb.

The Book of Opening the Way: Key # 5 In the discussion of Xem thus far, the Word had been approached from mostly its direction as regards the individual initiate. This was initially necessary [and will be again] so that the direction of the collective effort can be gained through the indi vidual effort. Let us now begin to approach discussion of the collective effort, so that we might know what that effort is moving the Elect toward, what th e 'Realm' of Xem is about, and what our mutual aspirations and efforts should be. As has been stated in the first four Keys, the individual effort mu st lead the evolving Magician into a state of Higher Being that is constantly evol ving; there is no stopping point. As this occurs, one experiences many change s in and around the Self. One also notes that reality is mostly perceptual, and that when the individual reality is combined with the perceptual realities of other Elect individuals, some ra ther complicated situations and circumstances begin to occur. This is purel y the nature of the Work for there is no predestination in alxemy, and Magical Creation establishes the real. While the Magician experiences complications and perceptual changes in and around the Self, the Magician also begins to notice changes i nvolving others. Once ca nnot really do anything about the changes that occur to others, but one can and MUST do something about those that involve one's Self. Willed evolution involves not only one's own Coming Into Being as Xem, but also involves and determines one's relati onship and role or Func tion with the Realm of Xem. It must be remembered that Xem is dual in concept, for the Word at once defines the individual Being and the Realm of Beings, all of which are Becoming cooperatively. The Xem Working laid the blueprint for the Coming Into Be ing of Xem. It is not a blueprint or prophecy of what will be, but rather for what can be, and the Principles involved are essential to individual and collective concepts of Xem -- one aiding the other. For this and any future discussion of Xem to be of any value, there mu st be a climate within the Temple of Set and among the Elect – both individua lly and collectively – which is responsive to the changes which will become evident as the Keys are added. This brings up the essence of Key 5 wh ich was revealed very early in the Xem Working , and which can be stated in a strangely simple phrase: \"Higher Man must conquer fear.\" Classification: V2 - A17.2 - 5 Author: Ronald K.

Magi cians must either crest the Ma gical current of the Aeon and cause/Will changes for and in their Selves as th e current crashes through what 'is', OR they will be sucked under by the force of it and very likely suffer Magical death by being bashed against the eroding rocks of false se curity and illusioned permanence. The \"Way\" itself is change -- transformati on. This is IN REALITY/TRUTH/MA'AT what initiation is -- initiating change. Change is th e most significant cause of fear, because the process is frightening and difficult; AND the result is UNKNOWN. One of the hieroglyphic translations of the Word \"Xem\" is in fact \"unknown\". [Consider the faceless/Name unknown god on the Stele of Xem .] With this in mind, it is easy to see why the Magical Formula of the Aeon can be disturbing or even terrifying to a nyone except the most zealous and adventurous. When we used to stand before the Altar and ' open the gates', those were the gates to change which opened. On XIII:11:11 when the gates were opened -- never to be closed again -- it was constant change that was opened and which is ever beyond those gates and through which the Way that Anubis leads or guides extends. Fear is the condition that blocks the Way of change. Xeper means change through Will , and Xem is the result of that change, but only when it is according to the Will and when the resulting condition and Being is higher or evolved -- as opposed to just being different or mutated. Th e act of accomplishing this is called MAGIC. In the year X, the Elect responded to the cha nges brought about through the Will of the Prince of Darkness, and the Temple of Set came to be known as such. The Book of Coming Forth by Night is full of references to past, current, a nd future changes up to and including mankind as a whole. It can be seen that, as has already been pointed out, whether or not one chooses to recognize the ongoing changes has nothing to do w ith occurrence of those changes, and it is very likely one of the major factors considered in the statement: \"I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an anni hilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid.\" Funk & Wagnalls defines annihilation as \"u tter extinction.\" Consider then that this worrisome statement could well mean that mankind as we now know the species is going to change right out of existence -- all except fo r the Elect who know and Unders tand the Principles at work, and use it to help bring about th eir own Coming Into Being ... as Xem . To possibly support this idea, let me jump ahead to the end of th e Working: \"We are not to view the annihilation as an old world dying -- but rather as Xem being reborn out of Itse lf with the Temple of Set as the vehicle.\" This statement from the Xem Working deserves more comment than what I am prepared to give in this Key, but please ta ke note of the positive emphasis of the change rather than the"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"negative. The Elect may hope to avoid the a nnihilation by taking inevitable change and, by force of Will, cause the Principles to bring about the Great Work or alxemy. Going back to the annihilation statement in BoCFbN , note the exact quote and place emphasis on the word \"now \". In this context, it appears as though the arrival of the Aeon of Set somehow heralds or initiates the hastening. Th e Utterance of Xeper in X impacted upon the world and began the process of Becoming, of e volution for the \"Elect and none other;\" of annihilation through change for mankind. The Utte rance of Xem gives direction to the Elect for the process by defining what we are Elec t to Become. [\"but I would teach them ...\"] Long ago another Word was given through Magus Cr owley which was to be the essential tool needed for the Work ahead. That tool would have to be given early enough that a degree of expertise could be acquired in the us e of it. That Word of course is Will . Now that we know the basics of the properties and pot entials of this force, Set states that [as regards his Elect] he must \"strengthen their Will against the coming peril...\". Between the first and third Words however a brid ge had to be made to (a) determine those bold enough and zealous enough to perform the Work ahead, (b) close the gap between the early initiates and the oncoming Temple of Se t, and (c) refine the Understanding of Magic and Will prior to using them in the Work upon and before us. For this Anton LaVey took upon himself the task of a Ma gus, and Uttered the Word Indulgence . Each of the Words are separate and unique a nd have made/are making their impact upon the world, yet any one without the other three is re ndered incapable of reaching full potential. The current Magical Formula combines the last two Words and utilizes all four. There is no riddle in having two Words [or four] active in a sing le Aeon, for they outline the Setian initiatory path. Of the Formula Xeper ir Xem however, let me repeat that Xeper is initiating, causing change, Becoming for its own sake. Xem then gives direction to the changes that are Willed and that is why Xem is always Higher, more specific, and causes balance between Being and potential Being. Xem is that which is Rec ognized, Realized, and U nderstood by the Elect Being perceiving Higher Being. Xem is the Self ahead of itself. To make that 'one step beyond' at any given point or time, the Elect must be without fear, for it is very likely our deadliest en emy. Fear can negate perception of the next step or perhaps even worse, fear can distort perception and cause unhealthy mutation. Fear also destroys the necessary force of Will necessary to take that next step and causes a desire to cling to the known, the familiar, and the illu sion of stability. Therefore, let the Elect who resolve to Become of the Gods also resolve to conquer fear that they might Xeper ir Xem . The Xem Working Classification: V2 - A17.22 - 1 Author: Ronald K. Barrett III° Date: June 22, XII (on Khemset) HTML Revision: September 25, 1998 CE"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":" Working question: About the mountain (Khemset ) \"complex,\" my strange thoughts, and the development of Self. The area in which I had chosen to Work was also near the site I had been preparing for my future home. There was no altar per se, as I had el ected to sit in a chair under the night sky. It seemed, however, that nowhere that I placed th e chair felt correct. Just about the time that I was getting angry at this inabi lity to start, the moonlight move d between some tree branches and created a nearly perfect circ le in the center of the dugout and in front of a small cave that I had uncovered while digging. Instead of facing west, which runs the length of the property uphill, I felt inclined to face south. The circle provided the Moon was definitely where I should be seated. I \"opened the gates\" and bega n to concentrate. As the Working began, I experienced the sensation of being a colossus, w ith the size and appearance of th e seated Rameses II. I did not know into what that was going to evolve, for I was rudely and quickly jerked back into mundane existence by something moving around in the fallen tree limbs behind me. I passed it off as being a lizard, quail, squirrel, or some similar small creature. When twigs began to snap, I assumed that it was probably a deer that had come snooping around. Next I heard it in the tree a few feet behind me, and then I knew it was an owl. But when twigs and small limbs began to fall, I knew that only an impossibl y large owl could create such a commotion, and my spine began to tingle. When I turned ar ound to look, there was nothing there, and the noise had stopped. When I turned to investigat e, nothing was to be seen. As I was becoming very frightened, the words \"Higher Man must conquer fear\" suddenly came to my mind. By an effort of Will, my fear subsided. I turned back to welcome whatever \"it\" was, and this time it was gone, not to return. I was awake. I proceeded to scan the mountain with the aid of full night vision and moonlight, and I saw it quite differently than I ever had before. There was a light blue-green h aze or aura around all the plant life, and somehow it would have seemed unnatural not to have seen it. My eyes were drawn to the waning Moon. I felt an association of Set with its darker side and of Osiris with its waning bright side, and something within me recoiled in rejection of the associations. Immediately I had a vision of a large hall, dimly lit, with several entities (approximately 15) gathered over against a wall and observing someone who was standing before a pair of scales. He was Anubis, and there was a heart being weighed against a feather. The scene was obviously the Hall of Judgment. Although the entit ies were in Egyptian garb and of Egyptian appearance, I recognized them as certain member s of the Temple of Set. Set was there also, but his presence was felt rather than seen. Then came an impression : \"Set is the leader only of Higher Man.\" This did not include all Setians . Anubis/I was before the scales only because an individual (whose heart was being weighe d) was seeking entry into this group of Elect/Higher Beings, and because I was in some way responsible. Another seeker would be judged by another of the Elect. Then my attention was directed to the end of this hall – only to behold a very disturbing vision. There, seated on his throne, was Osiris . He was not one of the Elect, but he was awaiting our verdict. I somehow kne w that his throne was at the entrance to the hall, and that Subject:  Xem  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"it was there for a very simple reason: his jurisdiction ended th ere. The individual being judged was not dead (as in \"un-alive\" ) ; rather he was seeking entr y into the Realm of Higher Man and Being. Should the scales tip ag ainst the seeker, he would be given back to Osiris, who is the god of the dead and of lowe r man, and of recycling them. This disturbed me, and I questioned where HarWer fit into all of this. I was made to see the Sun, and it was Ra by name – still no sign of the \"strange and fitful presence.\" Then a sentence from the Book of Coming Forth by Night came to me: \"But speak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barr ier.\" My perspective im mediately changed to one above the spot where I was sitting. I wa s looking down over the land, and it was now daylight with an incredibly blue-blue sky. I c ontinued ascending until the sky changed to very dark blue, then purple, then charcoal, and finally black. I could see stars all around me. Throughout all of this I was continually aware of being physically seated on the mountain. Then I looked back and Earth, half-dark and ha lf-lit by the Sun. Then I understood that Set is not limited to our night, but that we are; we are three-dimensional creatures. But we as Higher Man need not be . Neither are the Elect limited to communication with Set only during the hours of darkness ; rather they can communicate be yond the restrictions of the senses and of time and space. To accomplish this , The Elect must be aware that in the space beyond Earth the \"night sky\" is permanent. Th e day imprisons consciousness, but it is not escape-proof, and this provides a great exercise in Xeper. After an indeterminate time, I began receiving impr essions of what I felt to be the focus of my Working. It began with the words \"Higher Man\" repeating themselves over and over in my mind. Finally I saw myself aged -- but by wisdom rather than time. It was \"my Self ahead of myself.\" This being pointed out the errors of some of my thoughts and ideas. By his ancient [yet contemporary] wisdom he emphasized the concept of self-deception, the games and politics of lower man, and the quest to attain and maintain the level of Higher Man. As I listened to him – on his level -- I understood that Xeper is never a relaxed Will, but is rather a determination to be . Even activity in the mundane world must be the result of conscious Will and creative purpose. The onl y \"truth\" is that of being ! All else is games, religion, and politics; these are no part of Higher Man or Be ing. Those who Will to participate in the lower world are conscious of that wh ich they do and are ; but those who sink into it are imprisoned, and their Being is abandoned fo r aimlessness. Do not partic ipate in un-Being, and quickly eliminate those who do from those who seek to and Become and Be what they are Become . \"Xem\" is not the word for ancient Egypt, but ra ther the state of Higher Man -- the realm of Higher Beings. It later became the word for Egypt – \"Khem\" denoting a place, but this occurred during the decay of Egypt. The te mples and shrines of Egypt/Khem were but replicas of Working facilities for Xem – the state of Beings. There is no true Egyptian architecture for its own sake. What there is possesses no significance or purpose. We are not to view the annihilation as the de ath of an old world, but rather as Xem being reborn out of itself, with the Temple of Set as the vehicle. Xemset shall be the beginning of the restoration of facilities fo r Xem, and not a reproduction of a style of architecture called \"ancient Egyptian.\" The attitude of all who are there – residing or visiting -- is to be in keeping with the principle governing Xem or Higher Man – that Being Xeper.

Ritual compression commenced around 10:45. Anubis (1) stood before the Anubis statue in deep concentration; Nexbet (2) stood before the altar to prepare herself for the ritual.

[For her: \"There is that which separates and that wh ich divides; seek that which separates but does not divide.\" From her: \"Thou art the brother of life and the father of existence.\"] Then Anubis passed to Buto (6) and manifested the Serpent One, whom he had brought into being exactly ten months before. After that he passed the crystal to Se fekht; she went to stand before Magus Aquino. She summoned Ra-n-Set, who had been silent too long. \"I am pure and you are pure. Anubis has brought the metal of Set from the South, and he has placed it, and it has touched your lips and your mouth has opened.\" Magus Aquino raised his hood over his head and m oved before the Pentagram, then turned to the Priesthood. It was clear to all that Set ha d manifested himself th rough his High Priest and Magus. In fact, Magus Aquino's face was no longe r apparent -- there was a darkness within the cowl [later Anubis said that he briefly sa w something changing within -- but wasn't sure what]. He turned and very slowly looked at every one of the Priesthood. Never before have I stood in the midst of such majesty. The majesty of these young gods and goddesses. You are the Children of Set [and he listed the names].

Before me I see the Black Jackal, he who has opened the way for me. ... and from the desert ... he who lurked ... And I have raised him up so that all may see. What we present is the gist of what was sa id: Set spoke of the Aeons and the Coming Into Being of Anubis, who was the Opener of the Way, and hinted at the coming of something more ... But it was Ra-n-Set who proclaimed the words th at he would nominate Ronald K. Barrett to the Council of Nine as Magus V°. The new Word is Xem. Then he said, \"the body is weary,\" swaying perilously as if he would fall. \"My limbs are brought back together and I am made whole.\" He was supported immediately by Nexbet a nd Sefekht, who created a circle of energy around him. As he spoke, the Priesthood stretc hed out their arms to send him energy, then hugged him in support and great love. Set came to Anubis, put his hands around Anubis' h ead a few inches above it, holding them in a tense and clutching fashion, as if he wished to remove Anubis' head from his body. At the same time his own head was tilte d unnaturally to one side, as if in pain. Set called Anubis by name. \"What you have seen and what I have spoken [referring to Xem] - upon your head then do I place my charge. Do not let what has happened to them happen again. Do not let Anubis"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"minister to the dead.\" At this point the Bl ack Flame shot up in a blinding flash, the music swelled, and then the infernal music erupted outside. After the Priesthood hugged him, Anubis then stood behind Ra-n-Set and proclaimed, \"He who wears the two Crowns! Behold Exalted Man!\" Anubis then spoke to the Priesthood: ... Two lands – invisible world – world of darkne ss; and the world of light - Xem, being fused - the time of the great fusion. It is rightly written that this is the tim e of the Coming Into Being of the gods ... During the speech Medu-n-xonsu and Anubis felt th e gathering of the Old Ones to share in this event, and within their midst like a black pillar was Set, shari ng this night with his children. Anubis also had the sensation that \"h ere we go -- again,\" but with optimism. After 5,000 years, we have a chance to make it. Then Ra-n-Set said that if this be Truth, le t it be known. At that point, Nexbet saw before her Maat's gray form with her feather. Nexbet stepped forward and said, \"Give me your hand;\" and Ra-n-Set raised his left hand. She held it and pronounced that Maat was before him and held a feather for him, for his words were Tr ue. Ra-n-Set and Anubis clasped shoulders and stared into each other's eyes. Anubis had the distinct feeling of being able to speak to Magus Aquino -- one Magus to another -- on the bi g things; they have their own level of communication -- like a fath er and grown-up son. Anubis turned to the Pentagram and said, \"The gates have been opened, and they shall not be closed again!\" The scales were balanced. Footnotes 1. Magister Ronald K. Barrett 2.

At this point both she and Priestess Sarris had visions of the desert -- but the painted Arizona de sert rather than the Egyptian desert – the sky was blue, bright, and cloudless; th e day was windy, though pleasant. Priestess Reynolds perceived a child-like entity, both male and female, green-robed and innocent, with a crescent or horn-shaped \"headdr ess\" standing near us [we were clasping each other's shoulders]. Priestess Reynolds also said words to the effect that \"they are nine, and they each have a word, and you [NeXbet] spoke the words back to them -- only you can speak them, so that they might understand them.\" Sh e perceived again the \"Deceiver\" among us, whose presence, though deceptive, is a positive, constructive deception, rather than harmful. The Deceiver was created and formed from a r ecent Act, giving it life among those of Xem. Commentary : In later discussions both Priestesses felt that the Deceiver was Xem, lately brought into positive Being through Workings done from July on. This Deceiver is definitely constructive, but wears the robes of the sh immering rainbow to confuse and baffle -- a protective disguise that only the Worthy will pe netrate. Those who do so will be allowed to perceive and partake of Xem. Within a few days, a letter arrived to Prieste ss Reynolds from Magister Barrett with his own pertinent comments on the Working: I'm not sure why, but I get an impression of the Druids from it. Probably because of the green robes, which makes me think of their Ovates . I'm not saying it had anything special as regarding the Druids -- that wa s just the first impression I expe rienced in reading your report. Green was associated with Venus in western Magi ck and symbolized vege tative principles in Khem. I am particularly interested in the words a nd use of \"Nine\" and \"Deceiver.\" While I could \"read into\" the words quite a bit, none of it feels right -- yet. The young entity could symbolize the rebirth [so to speak] of the Neters through us, and that there will be nine original [paut Neter] or \"company of gods.\" Winged creatures could imply the pure Forms which are unmanifest. Maybe we are indicated by the green-robed youth. A magician is supposed to acquire a bisexual natu re as a quality -- not necessarily as sexual attraction.

Before this evening the Shen had appeared as a gigantic face ted crystal with a deep blue center. On this evening the Shen appeared as above -- and in this case Xonsu (2) felt it pulsating, while NeXbet beheld it: large, with a gold cor ona at first, then ra diating blueness, that pulsed vividly out of its crystal core. With this image came the unders tanding that infinity is a term which has been misunderstood: it stands for all the depths, all the BEING we can imagine, rather than Time and Space. THE HEART OF XEM REVEALED: The heart is th e symbolic term for the sensitivity, the depth of feeling, the seat of All -- that which Set needs to have expressed by US.

What you will read on these pages is an answer from Set to the question: \"What is Xem?\" In the beginning this question was personal, an attempt to Understand the Word Uttered by Magus Ronald K. Barrett in November XIII as he Understands it, and in many respects the quest remains personal. What has Come Into Bei ng thus far in reply to this question needs to be set forth for all Setians to examine and to Understand. On 10 April XIV I began to Work on a transla tion of the Stélé of Xem which accompanies Magus Barrett's Book of Opening the Way (Ref. F), because I strongly felt there might be a clue in the hieroglyphs to deciphering his Understanding of his Word. I soon had a strong impression that I was not Working on the right things, so I stopped and again asked of Set: \"What is Xem?\" I read the Book of Thoth for a visual answer, and the last page I drew was the Actor, a masquerade. The Way Shower, one of the titles of Anubi s, was reversed. Xem may be a Word, but it wears a mask. It is ei ther hidden or it hides something. I then asked, \"What is Xem-Set?\" for I had thought this was th e Word, and the answer included the Nine of Serpents, Self-Completion, and the Seeker, \"Seek further.\" April 11th is the birthday of Anton Szandor LaVey, and his Word came to mind as I re- opened my Working of the previous day. Totally Indulging our Selves in Black Magick to the point of obliterating the munda ne is how we must accomplish the statement on the \"Red Sheet\" of the Temple of Set, Inc.: (2) \"In the Aeon of Set the Elect will seek transmutation of the individual Will from that of a mutant be ast to that of a god.\" I soon found myself so immersed in my Working that I was drawi ng hieroglyphs, some of which I didn't know the meaning of. Instead of translati ng the Stélé of Xem, I began to Work on a translation of what I'd written down. Chills ran up and down my spin e as I read: \"I, My Se lf, am Set. You, your Selves, are the Neter Xem-Set.\" On the evening of April 12th, I read the Egyp tian and English for these hieroglyphs to an Initiate in Per-Bastet who got the same feeli ng from them that I had. When our conversation ended, I began to count -- ninet een parts -- and re-opened my Work ing to ask Set if these were the Nineteen Parts of the Word of Set pr omised by The Book of Coming Forth by Night (Ref."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"A) . In less than an hour I had written down The Book of Knowing the Way . It begins with a reminder that what happens in the macrocosm must also happen in the microcosm: As Above, So Below.

It was Magus Michael Aquino's Great Work to re-est ablish both, and it was a monumental Task. Both the Order and Temple have Come Into Being, and have evolved as no one could have predicted in the Year X. The \"Statement of Leviathan\" in The Diabolicon (Ref. A, pp. 55-56) has taken a new meaning. Magus Barrett has written that when Setians have \"gone beyond Xem they will have beheld Leviathan\" (Ref. H). In the Church of Satan, Leviathan was called the Serpent of the Watery Abyss (Ref. P), and in the myths of th e Hebrews and Christians it is a serpent who bestows Knowledge of Good and Evil -- U nderstanding, Perfect Wisdom -- upon Adam and Eve. Leviathan, stripped of these myths, is th e macrocosmic Set, which only the Red Magus described in The Diabolicon could look upon without being destroyed.

M, p. 234) with The Book of Knowing the Way : The Ipsissimus is wholly free from all limitations soever, existing in the nature of all things without discriminations of quan tity or quality between them. He has identified Being and not- Being and Becoming, action and non-action and tendency to action w ith all other such triplicities, not distinguishing between them in respect of a ny conditions, or between any one thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or without conditions. ... On 16 August XIV, Michael Aquino wrote to Ini tiates of the Temple of Set, Inc., that \"... I have reached the End of my In itiatory quest; I can learn furthe r skills but I cannot acquire further Being. \" Michael Aquino has Come Into Being as Ipsissimus VI° of The Order of Set; he is a Red Magus. I chose to reveal my entire Word to Anubis, and in November of the Year XIII of My Aeon, I raised him to the Will of a Magus. But Anubis did not fully Understand My Word. He did not understand that Form alone is emptiness and Emp tiness alone is Form. There can be no Form and no Emptiness without Set and HarWer. And s o, when My Word was given as Xem, and"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"when the Gates were left open HarWer entere d and almost destroyed My Word. As Anubis was the Opener of the Way of the dead in Khem , so shall he now Open the Way of the dead among my Elect. Referring again to Crowley (Ref. M, pp, 234-5): \"T he essential characteristic of the Grade [of Magus] is that its possessor utters a Creative Magical Word, which transforms the planet on which he lives by the installation of new officers to preside over its initiation. ... This does not mean that only one man can make personal progress equivalent to that of a 'Word of an Aeon'; but he will identify himself with the current wo rd, and exert his will to establish it, lest he conflict with the Work of th e Magus who uttered the Word of the Aeon in which He is living.\" By Xem Ronald Barrett fulfilled these characteristics; Xem is the Word of Magus Barrett, and is an answer to the questi on raised by Xeper – \"Become What?\" Depending on which reference one uses, \"neter \" can mean either \"Form\" or \"God,\" but \"Form\" has another meaning in The Book of Knowing the Way . \"Essential form or substantial form: in metaphysics, that mode of existence wh ich constitutes a thing what it is, and without which it could not exist\" (Webster). In othe r words, something can have \"Form\" without being a \"Neter.\" Emptiness is synonymous with \"Void:\" \"Empty, vacant; not occupied with any visible matter; as a void space or place\" (Webster). ... Form alone is emptiness and Emptiness al one is Form. There can be no Form and no Emptiness without Set and HarWer. This is a restatement of the principle that Se t cannot exist independently of HarWer. Set needs HarWer to define Itself in the same way, and for the same reasons, we find it virtually impossible to define \"u p\" without \"down.\" We know Set as the Form of Separate Intelligen ce and Order, and we call Set the Prince of Darkness. We have not been able to define these attributes w ithout HarWer as the Emptiness of Ignorance, Chaos, and the Prince of Light. If Set has Form, HarWer must be Empty, Void. This is how we look at these Entities, but to one whose existence is emptiness the polarities would be reversed, and this is why white-light religions are so popular. To them, their religion has Form. Xem enters the picture here. In December XIII, Magus Barrett wrote that Khem, the name for Egypt, is a corruption of \"Xem,\" and that the or iginal meaning of \"Xem\" had been lost. When one realizes that many Egyptologist s use \"chi\" in transliteration and \"kh\" in translation, Khem and Xem often turn up as the same word, and th e original meaning of Khem/Xem ought to be found somewhere in what has been written. \"Khem,\" according to Budge (Ref. I, p, 282, not e 3) was the original reading of the hieroglyphs later read as Mi n and now as Amsu. We find Ani saying: \"I am the god Amsu (Khem) in his coming forth; may his two plum es be set upon my hea d. Who then is this? Amsu is Horus, the avenger of his father, and his coming-forth is his bi rth\" (Ref. I, pp, 282-3). Khem is the \"avenger of his father Un-nefer or Osiris\" (Ref. I, p. cxxi). Lockyer writes (Ref. Q, p. 296) that \"Khons, Ptah and Khem [were] pi ctured as mummies; that is they became a sort of Osiris.\" In still anothe r reference (Ref. L, p. 270), Budge indicates that Khem is a form of Amen-Ra. If there is anythi ng in common in the gods connected to Khem, it is that they are all white-light gods. One finds none of the attr ibutes of Set among those of Khem, and none of Khem's attributes were given to Set."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Khem is the name of both the Ninth Nome of Up per Egypt and its god. It is also the name of the god of the Fifth Nome of Upper Egypt, erui (Ref. K, i, 97). The hieroglyphs for erui include two hawks, the symbol of Horus, and the Egyptian word for Horus is eru, In Egyptian Language (Ref. J, pp. 108-9) we read that: \"In the oldest texts the dual is usually expressed by adding UI or TI to the noun, or by doubling the picture sign...\" Khem would thus seem to be the god of the Upper Egyptian Nome of the Du al Horus -- eru-ur (HarWer) and eru-p-Khar (Harpocrates, or Horus the Younger). Form is Set and Emptiness is HarWer. Form is Life and Emptiness is Death. In The Book of the Dead the deceased is called Osiris plus his/her mundane name, as for example, Osiris Ani. \"Xem ren-f\" means \"whose name is unknown\" (Ref. I, pp. 92/310 and 217/356). Combining this with what we know about the way the E gyptians thought of Khem, the last sentence in this section of The Book of Knowing the Way becomes: \"As Anubis was the Opener of the Way of Osiris N. in Khem (eru-ur), so shall he now Open the Way of the Osiris Whose Name is Unknown among My Elect.\" The \"Coming Into Being of the Gods\" which Ma gus Barrett foresaw (Ref. C) is the creation by Set of a Neter, Xem, and a Neter, Xem-Set. These are the only Neters created by Set, and the others are our own creation so that our fini te minds can define Set and HarWer. Ma'at is our way of recognizing that Set is Truth, and Osiris is our way of recognizing that HarWer is Death. Because Set Willed the creation of Xem as a finite HarWer that we can define with our finite intelligence in order to make the creation of a fi nite Set, Xem-Set possible, the meaning of the reference to HarWer here is clear. Xem woul d, indeed, be the avenger of his \"father,\" HarWer, and allow HarWer to enter and destroy the Word of Set. Xem, in reality Amsu/Horus/Osiris/Amen-Ra, is the Actor in my reading of the Book of Thoth, masquerading as being akin to Set, when the reality is that Xem is Set's Opposite Self in the microcosm. The masquerade cannot be the Will of Set, and Chao s was the result. The Gates would be left open by Xem/HarWer. Xem has been used by Magus Barrett (Ref. G) to mean \"Majesty of Se t,\" and it is possible, perhaps probable, that Xem evolved into e n, which we find in the Hebrew Set-en. The Hebrews, incidentally, would pe rceive HarWer as having Form and Set as being Emptiness. The ibis became a symbol for Thoth because the word for ibis, te, was similar in pronunciation to teu, the moon as a measurer of time, one of th e attributes of Thoth. If an ibis could become a symbol of a dog-headed ape, one can assume that Xem could become em and perhaps eventually 'em. A setem priest may origina lly have been a priest of Set, or Xem-Set. The change from \"m\" to \"n\" is much mo re easily demonstrated: Anxembastet and Merensexmet, where em and en have identical meaning. The \"in\" in \"i nconsistent\" and \"im\" in \"imbalance\" also mean the same thing. Xem could have become en. The word Majesty in all languages needs a comple ment to define what or whose Majesty is being referred to. If Xem means Majesty, it mu st be complemented; alone it means nothing. In The Book of Knowing the Way we find Xem defined by Set, the Majesty of Set in the microcosm."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"I choose again to reveal My Wo rd to Anxembastet, who Underst ood that there was more than Xem. In My Word there is nothi ng to attain, since there is nothi ng that is not already attained by My Elect. Those who depend on My Word have no hindering obstructions. There is no fear or dread. Going beyond all conceptualizing, My Elect have attained Setamorphosis in the end. Because the Elect of the Three Aeons k now my Word, they atta in Perfect Wisdom. In recognizing Ronald Barrett as Magus V°, I stated that Xem was an answer to the question posed by Xeper: \"Become What?\" I doubt I was alone in this, or there would have been no question in the minds and Wills of any Setian as to how Magus Barrett Understands Xem. We must Become the Neter/Form Xem-Set, and this begins within us when we receive the Black Flame from the macrocosmic Set. Until th is happens, we are as Empty and as much within the Realm of Osiris as Khem. Those who Know their Names are the Majesty of Set being Created. We have attained the one Gift that Set can be stow on us, his Essence as the Black Flame. Xem-Set is something that is cr eated within us, not something we draw from outside our Being. By extension, we stand in Ma 'at because we have Ma'at in our Being, but we cannot stand before Ma'at, which would signify that Ma'at is not part of us. If we depend on the Word of Set, all obstructio ns to our growth, including the Neters we create, will fall and not hinder us. When we beco me aware of who we are, there is nothing to be afraid of. Setamorphosis is a composite of a dictionary definition of metamorphosis and the statement on the \"Red Sheet\" that we Will to metamorpho se from a beast to a god, Setamorphosis is a transmutation of our Selves, by the Will of Set, into the Neter Xem-Set as part of the True Creation written of in The Book of Coming Forth by Night . Aleister Crowley referred to the Aeon prior to 1904 CE as the Aeon of Isis, following the male-female polarity revealed to him. With an Understanding of The Book of Coming Forth by Night , we might want to change the name of the First Aeon to the Aeon of Ra, as Ra was the other god besides Set to whom the Egyptia ns gave the title Maje sty. One born before 1904 would be of the First Aeon; one born betw een 1904 and 1966 is of the Second Aeon, and anyone born after 1966 is of the Third Aeon. The Word of the First Aeon can be stated as: \"Awaken! Know Thyself!\" No matter what year we were born, if we Understand the Word of Set, which is possible only if we are Comi ng Into Being as Xem-Set, we will attain Setamorphosis. This is the promise of Set. Now let my Pentagram henceforth be hidden fr om the mundane. Let there be seen instead a representation of Form and Emptiness. Every initiatory society employs \"occult\" symbol ism in the sense that it is kept from view by the uninitiated, and this is the meaning behind this admonition of Set. Our Pentagram means nothing more to the uninitiated than a thing to profane. We have a Pentagram branded into our hearts by the Black Flame, and the only way to remove it implies total destruction of the Self. There is no admonition to remove the Pentagram from our altars, and it should become more important in our magical lives in proportion to the magical, as opposed to mundane, use we make of it. The fact that our lives are Form should be enough to identify our Selves to those whose lives are Empty."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Let it be known that HarWer is vanquished and sent to the Neter Region. In My Elect I shall now endure, and I have given of My total Essence to this. There is no need to speak, for My Essence is the Essence of the Elect. By Xem HarWer has been defined as the Neter of Emptiness. By Xem-Set, Set has given his total Essence and as Xem-Set, Set shall endure. There is no need to speak to Set; we would be speaking to our Selves as Xem-Set. The macroc osmic Set may not speak to us again, for the microcosmic Xem-Set speaks within. My Elect shall be given a Name by which he shall be Known by othe rs of My Elect, but he alone shall Know Who He Is. Those who call me Xem do me dishonor, for my Name is Xem- Set. I am Set in the macrocosm and Xem-Set in the microcosm. In many societies having a name implies having ex istence, and to be without a name, or to not remember one's name, implies non-existence (Ref , N, p. 161). A name is a Word of Power and the damned won't remember theirs (Ref. K, pp, i 301, i 296). On the other hand it is permissible to hide one's name, and Ra is one of the Egyptian gods whose name is \"unknown,\" in the sense that it is hidden. Anot her is Amen, the god \"who cannot be seen with mortal eyes, and who is invisible, as well as inscrutable, to gods as well as men\" (Ref. K, ii 2). One cannot Become Xem-Set without knowing who one is, and one of the steps in this is learning one's name (Refs. N and O). Our Magica l Names not only define our Self to our Self, but to others who know our Name. It is no le ss a dishonor to call Set Xem than it is for someone to call us by a name that is not ours. My Order shall not be divided, for as the parts of the Utchat do not equal one when they are separate, so My Order cannot be One without the Magick of the All. The reference to the Utchat is the Egyptian pr actice of using it to represent the common fractions , , etc., as well as the various parts of our Be ing: ka, ba, khat, ren, shut, and akh (Ref. N, pp. 156-7). The fractions represented by the Utchat add up to only 63/64, and the missing 1/64 is the \"magical cement\" that holds them toge ther, and gives life, as One. It is the Will of Set for Its Order to be separated into sub-Orde rs in which the Elect whose Paths are similar may gather together for mutual Workings and support, but it is not th e Will of Set for the Order to be divided. A divided Order cannot be One, and the \"magical cement\" is missing. All s and all s are similar, and all ka's and ba 's have something in common. All Elect in each sub-Order have things in common, and one sub-Or der can learn from the others, but their Path to Setamorphosis will be different, and it is no t the Will of Set for any sub-Order to impose its Path on others. The Will of Set cannot be done until all Understand this. My Elect, Know and Understand that My Word is Simple and Complex. It is great and sacred, clarifying, unsurpassed and unequalled. It is Now and for All Time. It is truly real and not false. Therefore let My Word now be said as:"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":" I Came Into Being and Created That Wh ich Came Into Being as Xem-Set. I, My Self, am Set. You, your Selves, are Xem-Set. My Word is Complete. Here can be seen the hieroglyphs I wrote down on 11 April XIV. Transliterated, they read: Xeper xeper xeperu em Neter Xem-Set. Set m- t'es-. Neter Xem-Set m-ten t'es-ten. I take them for what they Are, the Nineteen Parts of the Word of Set, both fulfilling the promise of Set to us in The Book of Coming Forth by Night and vanquishing the corrupt Enochian Keys which are the Nineteen Parts of the Word of HarWer. By the Word, we the Nobles, the Elect and Majesty of Set, are being brought, as Xem-Set, to Set. I have mentioned that this is still a personal que st. A Magical Word is de ceptive. It tells what but not how (Ref. S, p. 66). We have been to ld what we are to Become, but our Path is individual, and it is up to us al one to find our Way on our Path. In the Stélé of Xem-Set (3) there is a symbolic realization of how this will occur. In the first panel are Set on Its throne, Khem as a mu mmy, and a newly-create d Xem-Set. Xem-Set cannot see his creator, but he is aware of Who He Is becaus e the Black Flame burning as a Pentagram is in his heart. Xem-Set is naked be fore Set and Khem, symbolizing that he can do nothing to hide; his existence is open before both. Khem tempts Xem-Set with the white symbols of power, but Set holds th e arm of Xem-Set. It is not the Will of Set for us to accept anything from Khem. This corresponds to the first tw o lines of hieroglyphs in the Stélé of Xeper (see Ref. B, p. Thoth-9). The Throne of Set is in darkness and the symbolic Thigh of Set blocks out the Light of Khem. Set is alive and has Form. Khem is dead, a mummy, and is Empty. Xem-Set has been newly-created as Form by Set. In the top part of the second panel we find four gods and one goddess of emptiness: Harpocrates, Osiris, Isis, Horu s the Elder, and Ra, four of which are gods created by Man, and one of which is the model for the others. Each represents a hindrance, a pitfall, on the Path which Xem-Set follows. Harpocrates is the Child in all of us. Osiris is death. Because Xem-Set is depicted as being male, Isis represents the physical pleasures whic h tempt him. Horus the Elder is HarWer -- the Black Hole of Emptiness, the \"id monsters\" that would consume Xem-Set were he not Who He Is. Ra is the last opportunity Xem-Set has to renounce his Being and return to the dead"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"world of finite man. Each of these also repr esents how, by rejecting the gods and goddesses of Light, the Black Flame grows brighter within Xem-Set. Xem-Set travels alone in his barque on a Sea of emptiness. Only he and his barque and the papyrus, The Book of Knowing the Way , in his hand have Form. There is no guide, only a description of his Goal. The Pentagram in his h eart manifests his Will to reach the end of his Path. An an is seen on the bow of his barque, the Life he sees, a nd at the stern is a scarab, his remembrance of his Coming Into Being by the Word Xeper and the Will of Set. When Xem- Set has passed by the gods and goddesses of Light, and has rejected them, the end of his Path is complete and the Gates open to the last panel of the Stélé. We again find Set seated on Its throne, Khem, a nd Xem-Set, but their roles and positions have changed. Xem-Set turns toward Set and shuns Kh em. He beholds Set as the Leviathan of the Hebrew myth. Xem-Set accepts from Set the bl ack tcham, crook and flail and Becomes the Red Magus. Having seen the macrocosmic Set he travels in Perfect Wisdom. As a final indication that Khem/HarWer is vanquished, his hands are no longer seen. They are wrapped in the mummy's cloths. Two lines on the Stélé of Xeper say that mastery of the Will of Set is the Will of Set, and that those who do so will live in the company of the Elect. By accepting the Will of Set to look into Its Eyes, and by acce pting the Symbols of Power of Black Magick, Xem-Set has fulfilled this Will. He has been brought, as a Noble, to Set. The symbolism of the Stélé of Xem-Set is va lid for all who Understand. Although we define our Being as Xem-Set in terms such as Anxembas tet, Anubis, or Ra-en-Set, this does not alter Who We Are. Xem-Set is all of us who travel on the Path of Set. The three panels of symbolism are framed by the two feathers of Ma'at symbolizing that this Stélé, like the Word of Set, is truly real and not false. Becau se the symbolism is analogous to the Word of Set, the Word appear s on the base of the Stélé. How this takes place is further defined by th e Formula of the Word, which comprises the previous Words: \"Awaken! Know thySelf! Do what thou Wilt shall be the Whole of the Law! Indulge! Xeper as Xem-Set.\" It is the Will of Se t for us to behold him as Xem-Set, but this must also be our Will, and we must find our own Path. Let him Understand who can.

I was escorted to Lovecraft Grove (2) by Anubis (3) around 9 pm, and it was cold. The most enduring sensation of the night was the cold. I knew that Anpw/Wepwa wet would be there, and it so proved. At one point I heard him say to me, \"Xem is Knowing Being.\" But I argued (mentally), saying, \"You mean the Knowing Being.\" In the light of day I realized that what I heard was correct. \"Nothing can be assimilated to M aat that is not of Maat's na ture, true and indestructible consciousness.\" I was haunted by that sentence from Her-Bak all night: I would drift into sleep with it as my last conscious thought and my first upon awakening -- numerous times -- and it never left me. Intentionally or not, it ri gorously centere d my consciousness on Maat -- macrocosmic and microcosmic. I heard Thoth's Solstice message, \"... in Xem and become Her.\" (4) I knew suddenly that the \"Her\" referred to (which had puzzl ed us for so long) was Maat. Once I saw an image of a long paved road with the painted side st rips and yellow dotted center line -- and that \"we\" Init iates were traveling along it thr ough a deserted city toward the horizon that fast approached and the gates of Xem. I heard early on, \"The Temple of Set and the Temple of Man\" (ie: Higher Man), which I see now is the difference between the Temple of Set and Xem. Xem is Highest Man, and we link with the Neters to reach it. They can come to us across a permeable boundary created by those of us with the building blocks we erect within Xem -- for \"we are the[ir] ancient dreams.\" I later saw Anubis' sharp face with his silver/black nemes framing it; and he repeatedly pronounced, \"Xem is Ordered Chaos.\" It is not the Chaos of Pandemonium, but \"ordered\" (as in the Order of Anubis, etc.), a glorious chaos of Being(s) who would enter Xem and know that our individual wills, though separate, are not divided. I never felt alone. But I did have to wrestle with fear. As I heard strange noises and felt fear rising, I quieted myself, saying th at I was one with the night a nd with my Self, and there was nothing there save my Self (and a few honking d eer), and I did not fear my Self. This happened several times, and each time I comforted myself with this litany. The panic was put to rest -- at least for that night. I had flashes of people -- past and present, mostly non-Setians. Around midnight(?) a male, firm, older voice said clearly and authorita tively, \"Dead.\" I was indeed. And born anew. I demanded judgment from Maat and forced an im age of the weighing of the heart. But as I relaxed my mind, I saw a rough red sandstone- like three-dimensional trapezoid on a black pedestal which rose slowly; and underneath were scales -- large gold scales (balanced from the bottom, not the top). My \"h eart\"/ib suddenly appeared on the left and the red feather of Maat on the right, and the scales were balanced; and I heard a line spoken in early evening: \"Truth has no compromise!\" Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"For we must, each of us, each Neter, find our embodiment of Truth in our function and so exist; there can be no compromise, no execu tion of function, no matter how protective, without judging it in Maat. Ther e can be no Xem without the Ne ters, who are each Maat in their Being -- and each one must know it. I had the impression throughout the long night that I was trapped in another time frame, a dimension that would remain an eternally col d, starry night (there was no moon). When Orion set (around 9:30?), the s ky remained the same -- there was no perceptible movement in the sky until Venus rose; I really was in another tim e and place. But when Venus and the crescent moon rose, it was clear that the ordeal was over. I was convinced that I had failed -- absolutely and utterly -- nothing had happene d, nothing had changed, nothing had been faced. Only later, with hindsight and pe rspective, did I reali ze that I had done all that I needed to. Two Later Workings: On March 28, XIV at Xonsu's house, we did a working in preparation for her Ordeal. During the Working I saw Maat in an upright rectangl e receding as if down a long corridor, and she stood with a feather on her head and \"scales\" (the traditional kind) in hand. I saw her recede, farther and farther away, but suddenly from a new, different percepti on, I realized she was receding into my heart -- to my tekh and ib , and welcome there. On March 30, XIV I did a short Working. Here I r ealized that Set has indeed been Lucifer the light bringer -- but the light under the bushel; no one is awar e of Set unless through Horus, who is the light side, the \"puppe t\" set up for the teaching; but Set is underneath to be seen by the perceptive alone. His teachings aren't for the faint of heart, for they must go through great trials to face him (and their Selves). Footnotes 1.

The Book of Opening the Way 's first four Keys had already been distri buted to the Priesthood when I Became Priest. Much of the Priesthood was marching to the drum of the quest for Xem, and after reading the Keys and their commentaries, I joined the parade. The parade stumbled on May 31, XVII, when the High Priest, Magus Ronald Barrett V°, resigned from the Temple of Set. The para de halted and almost melted away during the trauma of the Set IV Conclave that summer, and of the period immediately following that conclave. Time has passed. The pain of year XVII has le ssened, and the survivors have matured. A new Magus has come into being, having Uttered a new Word. I recently chose to look again at Xem, to clarif y for myself its philosophies and its benefits to my Xeper, to determine if and how the quest of Xem enhances and furthers the challenge and process of Xeper and Remanifestati on. This analysis is the result. Xem is an optional step of Xeper. Many Setians reading this essay will not have Xem in their future. I suggest you read this essay (and other works concerning Xem) not for Xem itself, but for Xeper, and the assistance these words can give you wherever your path of Xeper leads. I will quote fairly extensively from works th at are not (yet) in The Ruby Tablet of Set where appropriate. Most of these works can be consid ered RL-4 type works, and you can probably get them from interested members of the Pr iesthood. The bibliography at the end of this article will indicate whether and where any spec ific item is available at this time. I assume that all who read these word s have already read the five Keys, (3) and have thought about them. If you have not, please do so before reading further.

(In other materials, Magus Barrett in dicated that only the highest degrees, the V° and/or VI° [or higher], could achieve Xem. (4) I disagree with this theory, as discussed below.) Although Xem is a recognizable state which may be achieved only after one Becomes Magister Templi, Xem is not necessarily a degr ee. I believe that a Magister Templi IV° does not need to pass through the V° and/or VI° st ates to Become Xem. Nor need a Magus or Ipsissimus find it easier to Become Xem. Rath er, the path to Xem is a branch of Xeper different from and independent of those br anches which lead to the V° and VI°. Xem is an optional step of Xeper. An Adept ne ed not become Priest to remain Setian; nor need a Setian reach or even strive for Xem. Upon his achieving the grade of Ipsissimus, Dr. Aquino wrote, \"I have reached the End of my In itiatory quest; I can learn further skills but I cannot acquire further Being.\" (5) Dr. Aquino has not claimed to have achieved Xem, nor does he seem to see Xem as a step of his own Xeper. (6) The Ipsissimus is one example of a IV°+ Initiate who needs not strive for nor achieve Xem. (7) Priest Wade's statements on this matter exemplify this point of view: (8) Thus, I was content to ignore this enigmatic Form until I could perceive it as something tangible enough for me to Work wit h. I encourage you to do the same. This does not mean that the Priest or Adept should not study or work with Xem. The Adept and Priest can begin the work which leads eventu ally to Xem. Perhaps more importantly, they can immediately benefit from ideas ga rnered through the study of Xem. Xem is a step on the path of Xeper. Only those who Xeper can Become Xem. Xem is a recognizable state, and the Magistry will be able to Recognize anyone who Becomes Xem. Xem can be reached through many different paths of Xeper, just as any of the Temple's recognized degrees can be reached by many differe nt paths. Perhaps it's better to say that many paths of Xeper lead through Xem, paths which again diverge in many different directions once Xem has been achieved. Many othe r valid and desirable paths of Xeper do not reach for or through Xem. Just like there are points of similarity shared by all paths which lead to any given degree, so too do all paths through Xem, diversified as they may be, have points of similarity. This analysis will examine these points of sim ilarity, the qualities of Xem, and the methods used to reach Xem. Purity of Being Magus Barrett quoted \"The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance...\", (9) and stated: (10) Each aspirant must pass through to Xem, and be ing called Setian is no guarantee of passage. One must BE Setian. Xem is a high and powerful state of Be ing. The id-monster dangers mentioned in Black Magic in Theory and Practice (11) are magnified in this arena, and the initiate must take care to eradicate his own imperfections while striving fo r Xem. The stresses of Magus Barrett's reign,"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"and the pain which followed it, serve as examples of what can result from failure to purge ourselves of our personal demons. Students of Xem frequently ask two questions – what are the qualities that must we outgrow, and what qualities must we attain? What ideals do we leave behind? Those ideals that are not ideals of Higher Man, those ideals that have no place among the Neters, those are the ones that need to be eradicated from the Self. Priest Whitaker once mentioned 'love' and 'fam ily' as possible candidates for elimination. (12) Must we leave behind Motherhood, a pple pie, and the American Way? (13) Our heart strings are pulled because we recognize the value of the ideals of love and family. Our Heart strings are pulled, because these ideals are of the Heart. Setians have wholeheartedly accep ted the Neters of the left ha nd path: Xepera, Maat, Anubis, Shu, Leviathan, Amon, and others. We have at times cast scorn on the Neters and ideals adopted by past traditions, and those unconsci ously adopted by the masses, but we must remember that these were, and are, Neters. It is appropriate to shake our heads at Man's past (and present) follies, but the Setian must be able to find Set's jewels of wisdom wherever they may be found. (14) Yes, some human ideals must be given up, and outgrown; ideals like laziness, mediocrity, irrational greed, and irrational ch arity. Other ideals are to be treasured, nurtured, and adopted or merged into the Self. (Note that since his above commentary was wr itten, Priest Whitaker has married, and he and Priestess Whitaker have a son. Prie st Whitaker has his answer.) We have glanced at the first questi on. Priest Neilly asked the second: (15) I do not know if what I consider to be logical in any instance is also th at which is Higher Man. Yes, Higher Man will be logical, where logic is called for. And Xem will be rational, able to surpass logic when logic alone will not suffice. More, Xem will be supralogical and suprarational, able to Know and Understand that which can not be logically or rationally explained. This talent comes from the Heart. Heart and Mind must work together, two aspects of the same activity, neither overpowering the other. On ly in this way can Xem be discovered, and achieved. Is the \"... Being that was not \" totally different from my pres ent state? ... Can the new Being do any other thing but the Work? Xem is the nameless higher Self, the essence of our Thelema, the cause of our Indulgence, and the direction of our Xeper. Xem is that wh ich is to be Remanifest. This Self can only Xeper from the seed already within our selves."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"We will become Xem, that Xem which is already within us. All(?!) we need to do is learn how to Remanifest that Highe r Self who is yet to Be. Yes, that Being will be very different from our present state, even while being very closely related to our present st ate (as the mighty oak is related to the humble acorn). But no, Xem is not limited to the Work. Xeper is unlimited gr owth of being, Remanifestation is unlimited being in growth, and Xem is unlimited Being. Xem -- the Quest Xem must be recognized as a de sirable state of Being, willfully chosen as a step of one's Xeper, accurately perceived by the initiate, and earnestly worked towards. Xem does not occur by accident. Xem is reached through a Quest. Each initiate must define his own Question, and must Quest for the Answer. Just as in Alchemy the initi ate himself is transformed upon creation of the Philosopher's Stone, so too is the initiate tran sformed to Xem upon resolution of or during his Quest. I invite initiates of the Order of the Trapezoid to compare this Quest to the Grail Search. The Question and the Quest are individual. In itiates may occasionally share a Question, but more often our Quests will each be unique. Th is is because we are individuals, Willfully individualistic, and Growing more so as we Xeper. Our Question must be critically and vitally important to this unique individual, and our Quest will reflect our individuality. In other works I've quoted Crowley's statemen t, \"My Qabalah is not your Qabalah.\" In the Tarot Primer I've cautioned that my Tarot is not your Tarot. Magus Barrett's quest for Xem is not your quest; nor is mine. Many initiates have wondered when they should select and start their quests. Priest Wade discovered one criteria above: wait until Xem is meaningful enough to work with. He also stated: Concerning the view that Khem is principally the province and prerogative of III°+ Initiates, it may be worth noting that statues of Sekhme t were traditionally carved from black onyx. This does not mean that only Priests can work towards Xem, but only those that Work in the Black Realm of Set can progress towards Xem. Pr iests have begun to work regularly in this realm, and many Adepts are able to reach into this realm on occasion. Those who have not yet developed this ability should work on their Xepe r, perhaps with Xem in mind, but with Xeper ever foremost. Then, provided your Xeper is forging ahead, an d you are working within the Black Realms, Magister Lewis suggests that, (16) To pin down the exact point at which the quest begins is rather hard because quests, like Initiation, often begin before there's a consci ousness of what is occurring. The Heart will already be at work wondering and seeking when th e Intellect begins to express the input it has received. The Intellect is of gr eat value to us, but more important is the Heart, which is the"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"foundation of Being. Yet the Heart totally alone cannot push one to Xem. It requires a balanced flow of input to the Heart from the In tellect and back to the Intellect which in turn receives the new input and ag ain sends back to the Heart ad infinitum . (17) While all this is going on, the balanced Being is heading serenely Xemward, concentrating all its Will on the task. The start of the Quest does not require Magistry, nor even Priesthood. An Adept can launch a quest which eventually leads through Xem, and incidentally through both III° and IV° degrees. But many Adepts and many Priests ar e not yet ready to Quest towards Xem. If you are not ready to Quest for Xem, don't do it. To struggle mightily and fail, to strive and make little or no progress, is a blow to one's self-perception which can make Xem even harder to reach. How will you know if Xem is necessary to your Xeper? If you don't know, don't worry. Xeper, and one way or the other you'll find out. How will you know when you're ready? If you Know yourself, you'll Know when you're ready. You'll know that now is the Time. You'll be filled with energy, confidence, and you will be Ready. If you aren't sure, you aren't ready. [These Quests] require a great amount of zealousne ss, of Magical work, of self- discipline, of self-inspection, and no compromise. ... Once begun, there is no going back.... ...Those who are not ready ... should wait until they recognize Xem. But to wait too long might cause the Will to grow weak, and they might be imprisoned in lower states of rest and preservation. (18) How long is \"too long\" to wait? How can we a void the dangers of weakened and stagnant will? Xeper is your yardstick. Do you Willfully Xeper, or do you coast? Do you work at and direct your growth, or do you just accept growth where it's easy? If the latter, you are in danger of stagnation, and of losing the spark of the Black Flame that powers your Xeper. Fan that flame, and reactiv ate your Xeper. Exercise your Will. Or you will lose that which makes you Setian. Be interested, and follow your interests. Do not worry about Xem or the Quest. The Working Initiate may find himself on a Quest without co nsciously choosing to quest (as indicated in Magister Lewis' discussion of the Quest quoted above.) Some of us will encounter that Quest which forces itself upon us, the Question to which we Need an Answer. Magus Lewis' quest which resulted in Remanifestation was one; Magus Barrett's quest which resulted in Xem was anot her. Xeper Willfully, and one such Quest may find you! There is an unmistakable, unavoidable premise rampant in the Land of the Temple: and this Magical phase to the steps ahead, although de layed by some, CANNOT be circumvented by the Initiate who WILLS to XEPER in continuity..."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"... Each Initiate will achieve this state by whatever means available and by whatever NAME it is called. But it is undeniable that this step MUST be taken ... as it lies before us. (19) Xem as a Goal Where does this Quest lead? What do we find at its end? Magus Lewis has called Xem \"the eternal quest\". (20) Ah, such adventure! Xem has been described as a goal, achieved th rough a Quest. Many of us originally equated the two, and quested for Xem. Such statements are common throughout the commentaries originally published in The Onyx Tablet of Set . Magus Barrett neared Xem this way; Xem was hi s Quest, the Quest which led to the Uttering of the Word. But Priest Barrett's Quest was not 'to Become Xem;' rather his Quest was to achieve an understand ing of a Question criti cally important to him. This quest for Understanding of his Question led him, almost inci dentally, to the IV°, and eventually to the V°. Xem is but the expression of the answer finally reached by Magus Barrett. Xem is the answer to Magus Barrett's Quest. It will not be the answer for any other Quests. A major failing, perhaps the major failing of most initiates working towards Xem, was seeing Xem as a goal to be achieved. But Anubis did not fully Understand My Word. He did not understand that Form alone is emptiness and Emptiness alone is Form. (21) Xem, a state of Being, a Form ( Neter Xem whose Name is Unknown (22) ), alone is emptiness, worthless. Even Magus Barrett's emphasis on Func tion could not remove this emptiness of the quest for Xem. Form and Function, without Pur pose, has no value. For with no purpose the force of mind must fail.... (23) As long as Xem is viewed as an end, no matter how temporary an end, Xem can not be reached. Rather, Xem is a step of Xeper to be reached while striving for something else. Magister Flowers cautioned: (24) Xem enhances Xeper in a special way -- but its \"danger\" lies in a weir d angle that many have perhaps not considered. That is, man, especially magicians, are born aim or goal setters. Xem represents the plateaus in Xepe r (almost all evoluti onary / dynamic processes go in quanta – spurts – of activity). That which is \"human\" in us covets the plateaus. These come quite NATURALLY – without us willing them. What we must do is constantly keep our wills directed toward Xeper; the Xem-levels will be there regardless. If, however, one starts to concentrate the Will on Xem, the energy can be drained from Xeper (dynamis). Yes, this danger and tendency exist. Yes, many of us will fall into this trap. And each time we do, we must see for ourselves that we are trappe d; we ourselves must climb out of the trap; and we ourselves must resume our Xeper."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Work This which is to be revealed of Xem will require effort of Will to understand. (25) Those who wish to understand Xem and work towa rds or through Xem need to Work at this activity. While aspects of Xem can be understood through superficial st udy of the Keys and commentaries, such superficial study will not yield the benefits of Xem. The Elect must raise their own states of Being to new levels constantly and just as constantly maintain the highest level of Being attained. This statement (also from Key # 1) forecasts and explains an aspect of Remanifestation. Xem is reached only through zealous Work. Thos e who Xeper but slowly, leisurely, will not achieve Xem. Using an analogy from Chemistry, a mixture of chemicals can react to yield many different possible results. But some resu lts can be obtained only through the use of high temperatures and/or high pressu res. Xem is such a result. Remanifestation is an obvious requirem ent of Xem and of the Quest of Xem. (26) Only by the Remanifestation of what he Is, can the Initia te Xeper towards what he Will Be. Xem, the advanced state of Being, must be continually and repeatedly Re manifest, or it will be lost. It takes an Awareness of multiple factors and an acute knowledge of the Self to comprehend the Xem of the moment ... and the very second it can be described in detail [i.e. \"pinned down\"] it's no longer Xem. Just as the quest wi ll call for a constant s earch, so the knowledge gained and utilized will impact on the Initiate and change his view / Will / Xeper / Heart / quest and the Xem he seeks. That Xem will not stay put in one place can be maddening. If it ever seems to do so, I suggest an immediate inte nsive analysis of the Being for a judgmental error. (27) Xem is a moving target. Xem must be pe rceived to be achieved. Xem must be continually perceived to be achieved (one of th e many aspects of Remanifestation). To achieve Xem, the Setian must perceive wh at he can of Xem, and must Become that perception. He must incorporat e the knowledge, understanding, and lessons of that perception into the Setian's being. Remanifesting that enno bled state, the Setian wi ll perceive more of Xem, and will be able to Xeper further towa rds Xem. It is only through pursuit of this repeating cycle of perceive / ach ieve that the initiate will eventually near and reach Xem. (28) Methods of Work The Work leading to Xem obviously includes stu dy of the words written about Xem. Priest Neilly, speaking for several of us at the time, wrote: (29) Anubis speaks and writes in such precise terms that I must guard myself so I don't miss or misinterpret ... even one word. And by so guarding itself, the intellectual falls into a trap. Yes, each word is important, but each word, phrase, sentence, or page is almost meaningless without the whole . The words are for the intellect, but only the H eart can understand the message."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"The danger of purely symbolic communication, mystical and obtus e, is that the message may get lost. We've all known occultists who babble at us without saying anything, using symbol instead of substance, symbol without content or context. To avoid such nonsense, the Temple of Set insists on clear an d precise communication. In avoiding one extreme, the mystical, we ri sk the other extreme, the intellectual. The intellectual runs to the dicti onary, and pins down the one and only meaning of each word, each sentence. But as Black Magicians, Indi viduals, we share the glory of unique perceptions. One of Anubis' more significant contributions was the widely dispersed and clearly illustrated use of symbolism in communication. Magister Lewis demonstrates the power of our unique perceptions in hi s analysis of Key # 4, indicating how his perceptions of the symbol s of the Stele of Xem differs from and complements Anubis'. (30) Most of us can accept such differences in point s of view when dealing with obvious symbols, pictures and hieroglyphs. Magus Barrett calls on us, in Key # 1, to do the same with his words . Yes, Magus Barrett wrote precis ely and concisely in these Ke ys. But the Heart can find many more meanings in these words than the Intellect can. By all means use the intellect, but keep the Heart involved also. Work is required to reach Xem. What is th is Work, and which tools and powers should we use? Priest Cole proposed: (31) The awareness of, and communication with Set wh ich are the province of the Black Magician give him the magickal \"muscles\" to be awar e of, and to \"communicate with\" (approach and manifest) Xem. It is not in the nature of Set to \"step in\" in a more dire ct fashion, for the value of Xem lies more in the Quest and the Work th an in its actualization by an individual.... Per The Diabolicon , it is clear that Xeper is the province of the indivi dual, with an initial (non- inertial) shove, but no furt her guidance, from Set. Awareness of and communication w ith Set by itself does not gi ve the magician any power over Xem. Rather, this awareness, comm unication, and touch of Set are results of the powers already developed by the initiate. These qualities , activities, and powers are necessary for the Quest; without them Xem can not be realized. But they are the magician's gift to Self, personal creations made possible by Set's Gi ft, not themselves a gift from Set. Yes, Xem can only be reached through the Quest. Set can not remove or even lessen the Work involved without destroying Xem. Xem is the res ponsibility of the individual who seeks it. BUT, Set does \"step in\" and take an active ro le in an initiate's Xeper, when invited . Set will not perform the Initiate's Work, but Set will give guidance, su pport, and power to those who choose to work closely and actively with Set. “ And I think not of t hose who think not of me .” ( 32) "},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"I further disagree with Priest Cole that \"the va lue of Xem lies more in the Quest and the Work than in its actualization by an individual.\" Yes, the Work is extremely beneficial and important to the initiate, but I also believe that the state of Xem itself has equal value, a value recognized only by those who achieve Xem. All of the commentaries deal with the subject of Work. Priest Neilly successfully identified the relationship between the in itiate's Work and Being. After quoting from the second Key and The Xem Working , Priest Neilly said, (33) I now begin to know and understa nd and see the actualit ies and realnesses, rather than just seeing slightly below the surface. I can recogni ze some of what you have been saying about BEING all of the time and: \"IN ALL THAT YOU DO.\" (your quote). That does not mean physically doing projects, writi ng letters, reading, etc ., in all of the time you have from the mundane ... it means to BE a nd BEING in all that you do, no matter what it is you are doing at any particular time. Again, from the Xem Working: \" Even activity in the mundane wo rld must be conscious Will and with creative purpose .\" From this statement and others like it, ideas begin to hit home base with me. \"... but those who sink into it are imprisoned and BEING is abandoned for purposelessness .\" I am glad that I re-studied the Xem Working in conjunction with the Keys and your letters. It is easier for me to NOT be defensive and assure you that when I indulge in such past-times as social events, T.V. or whatever (s ome of those being diversions), I do know what I am doing and in that I hope I am one of: \" Those who Will to participat e in the lower world are conscious of that which they do and Are ...\" Magus Barrett made clear his V° opinion that the in itiate of Set, the ini tiate of Xeper, should always be working, and should always be work ing on Xeper with Xem in mind, if not as a direct goal. This stress on Work was felt throughout the Temple, and the stress contributed significantly to year XVII's trauma at the II° and III° levels. Magister Lewis responded to the em phasis on Work with this comment: (34) The Keys stress Work and if you're like me, you'll sit down, read a book not on the recommended list, or flip on T.V. and suddenly f eel something akin to guilt. There was a time this was driving me bananas until I re-examine d my concepts. Life, my students, is a Work. Being is a Work. And as in all things, we balance caref ully to avoid burnout. So sure -- read a book, take naps, watch a movie on T.V., take plea sure from the humans. Indulge and indulge. Only you can say how much is too much and believe me, if you go overboard, you'll know it. There is but one great Truth and that is the Truth of Being. Be yond that all else is what one does with the Being. Yet there are certain ru les and on these depend whether one can pass Maat and enter Xem's portals. Mutants and Gods seek Xem but only the Gods are of Maat and only they possess the vision to see Maat. Xem requires Work, but not exces sive work. Rest and relaxa tion are normal, healthy, and required for balanced Xeper towards Xem. Xe m requires Being, and even the highest of"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"Beings can relax and rest. As you Remanifest higher states of be ing, relax and rest as those higher states, and your Xeper wi ll continue to advance. Initiation Several Priests and Masters have attempted to describe their personal initiations. They have shown that initiation is different for each of us. Initiation reflects our own individuality. Sometimes initiation occurs in ritual, and so metimes not. One initiation took me while I was sitting at my computer in the middle of the afternoon, doing some word processing. Perhaps that phrase \"took me\" will help you understand initiation. While we must work towards and prepare for initia tion, and while we may conduct ritual specifically for the purpose of causing initiation, and while we ourse lves must accept and enter the challenge of initiation, we, our active conscious Selves, can not control that initiation. Initiation is brought to us and shaped by our Highe r Selves, and/or by Set, after we (our active selves) have laid the gro undwork. Magister Lewis said, (35) There is a thing about an Init iatory experience which permits no over-looking of it. The new understanding gained by it alerts the Magician to the fact that, hey, something happened! ... Some Initiatory experiences almost sneak up on us; others give undeniable signs of their impending arrival. ... ... the act is inevitable to those who force the inner issue involvi ng the Self and its Xepering in Xem's direction. Xem is inevitable if you meet its requirements. Those requirements, expounded at length in the Keys and all commentaries, can be summ arized as \"forcing one's own Xeper towards Xem.\" The preparatory Work is long and ha rd. When that Work is complete, you'll find yourself in Xem. This One has fallen from \"grace\". There is now a free Will: ungoverned by any but the Silver Heart. Herein is a Black Flame so intense as to move the Universes and becloud the masses. But the road is difficult to that place of Magic and Elysian Bliss. The way is ever open; but rarely travelled by any but the resolute. We of the Temple of Initiation ... dwellers of the Black Land of Set, are invited to embark on the journey to that place. (36) In other words ... (37) Initiation into Xem does not simply occur when one is ready. We must consciously decide to undergo this Initiation, and must Willfu lly follow through with this decision. The Setian who is truly ready for Initiation into Xem will know it. The need for Initiation will be apparent. The Setian's Being will cry out for In itiation, and will not rest until the ordeal is met. Xeper. Xeper actively in Balance, and you will achieve Xem if it is your Will."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Fear Higher man must conquer fear. Not only is zealous Xeper requ ired, but fearless Xeper as well. Changes can be worrisome, and it is NATURAL to approach changes with fear, especially changes concerning the self, concerning the death of old, known, and comfortable selves, (38) concerning the birth of a new, unknown Self. But th is Fear is antithetical to Xem. Only the Initiate who conquers this Fear, who Willfully and Joyously Indulges in Xeper, can hope to achieve Xem. \" Only those who have conquered fear should provoke the ordeal... \". Remembering that what one will meet is the Self as it Is, I think this advice / statement sound and wise. What is this \"fear\" that we should overcome it? Fear is a weakening agent, one th at permits hesitation, rationalization, and compromise -- all the things that do not lead to Xem. (39) Initiation and the Black Mirror of Maat reveal the Reality of Self. Fear of this Reality, Fear of the Self, leads to rejection of this Self and/or rejection of your perceptio ns of its weaknesses. Reject that perception, and you tu rn your back on Xeper, on Xem. Reject that Self, that Reality, and you will become a prisoner of dreams, unable to Xeper. We can also talk of the Fear of the Future, the Higher Self, that which you will Become. Fear of this Future, Fear of this Self, leads to rejection of the Future and towards stagnation. We talk of these two points of view, present and future, Active and Higher Being, as separate items. But the Higher Self is the Self, waiting to be born th rough the fire of Initiation, the metamorphosis of Xeper. Rejection of this future is rejection of Reality and of the present, and also leads to imprisonment in illusion and the failure of Xeper. ...who Understood that there was more than Xem. In My Word there is nothing to attain, since there is nothing that is not already attained by My Elect. (40) Xem is already within us. We Are Highe r Man. Perceiving and achieving Xem requires only(!) perceiving and Becoming ourSelves. Any fear of such Xeper is misdirected -- our fear should be of not completing our Xeper, of not Becoming our Selves. Closely related to fear is cau tion. Are we to become foolhar dy with our disregard for fear? Magister Lewis suggests: (41) You are advised against the obviously dangerous (such as playing with rattlers ... even I'm reluctant to do that!); the \"fear\" that is referred to is that which would make one turn back; perhaps playing with rattlesnakes is safer. I would amend this recommendation to avoid the obvious and unnecessary dangers. Your Quest may require doing something obviously dangerous. If so, you must face the obviously dangerous with intelligent cauti on and care, but without fear. By all means get a second (and third) opinion of its necessity, and take steps to reduce the danger, but don't hesitate or shy away from the truly necessary action s required by your path of Xeper."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Set and the Neters The initiate can not achieve Xem by himself, but the initiate must work closely with Set and with the Neters. Every Setian is encouraged to work with Set. This theme is repeat ed throughout our written works, and in every formal ritual. There are times when the Setian flexes his own magical muscles and does not ask for assistance, but even then Set is called upon to witness and share in the Setian's Xeper. As discussed above, I reject Priest Cole's supposition (42) that Set would not give assistance with the Quest for Xem. The Setian will and must work closely with Set in all aspects of Xeper. Let's take a look at the Neters. Ptah described them so: (43) If we are to be \"aware of Set -- as well as th e Old Ones,\" does this im ply that the Neters too possess separate, objective existence in the sa me manner as Set? Who sanctions the \"Old Ones\" in their interest in our Work? Why are th e \"Old Ones\" so necessary to our Work that the Magus tells us we must use their aid if we de sire to achieve Xem? The first question is the easiest to an swer. The Book of Coming Forth by Night bluntly tells us that these \"Old Ones\" can not have such an existence when it states that \"All other gods of all other times and nations have been created by men.\" Although we have no direct statement in any of our documents which we regard as from Set, in The Pentagram of Set Working record, a record of a conversation with Set, (44) Ptah explains the blue spiraled field as em anations of Essence, or Nete rs, \"from a common center -- you\", when speaking with Set. Set agrees. It is ther efore logical to conclude that the creation and sanction of the Neters is due to Set's desire to assist us on our journey. Given the preceding, we are still left with the question of why we are encouraged to Work with the \"Old Ones\" in conjunction with Set, ra ther than with Set alone? Back to The Book of Coming Forth by Night we go . \"I am the ageless intelligence of this Universe.\" If you take a few minutes to think about it, that statement of power and authority is difficult to comprehend in its entirety. It would be much easier to know and understand Set if we could do so slowly -- more gradually -- as if in bits and pieces. En ter now, the natures of the Neters. Thus we may know the whole better by learning from its pa rts, as well as the sum of its parts. In The Book of Coming Forth by Night , Set did not say, \"All the gods of all other times and places have been created by either you or me .\" Men created their own gods, all except Set and HarWer, and including the \"Old Ones\", the E gyptian Neters (and those from other cultures). Yet we accept the Neters as aspects of Set, and work with them as aspects of Set. This is not a contradiction. Set gave his gift to Mankind, and gave his essence to his Elect among mankind. Those Elect who most strongly absorbed and shared this gift created the Neters (perha ps with the help of their followers and/or Set)."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Note that Set did not say that other gods do not exist -- he only said that they were created by men. The Neters exist. They are reflections of Set, created by men. They are aspects of Set, given life by the Elect of Set. As creat ions of men, they are more unders tandable to us than the stark ageless intelligence of the Universe . By Understanding and Worki ng with these Neters, we become more attuned to Set, eventually able to create our own Neter, the Nameless One, who will then have a Name. The initiate Working toward Xem will Work closel y with a single Neter. Your work with this single Neter, and the resulting clos eness of this Neter, will help develop and define the Being who achieves Xem. As mentioned above, the ini tiate can not be limited to working with only one Neter; the many aspects of Set must be involved in achieving Xem in balance. But the initiate who approaches Xem will definitely have an affinity for and a very close Working relationship to one specific Neter. (45) How do we choose the Neter with which we will Work so closely? Priest Cole reminds us that the critical word in this question is \"Work\". (46) Being a Quest, only a Neter that aids that Quest will be of interest. That which we call the \"Neter\" is the unlocking of the inner e ssence of the Magickian, the distillation phase of alXemy. In opening the ga te to this Inner Being, the Magickian is emphasizing and amplifying those aspects which ar e most Magickally potent within himself. This yields both the direction in which further Work will be most profitable, and the means by which it can best be accomplished. (47) The Initiate who will Quest for Xem must work cl osely with one Neter, chosen for the Neter's Function and usefulness to the Quest. When will this relationship arise? Priest Neilly asked, (48) I am going through a situation now where I am ev aluating the constituti on that is known as: \" The call to Initiation... \" I think of other \"calls\" that I have had, such as to write a letter to the Order on ways that the Temple of Set can make itself known to potential-Elect. Even the call to the Priesthood. And in attempting to recognize and differentiate the cal l to Initiation and another call, I feel appr ehensive about this: \" An important part of Init iation is the call to the Neter with which the successful Initiate will Work... \" ... Should recognizing my Neter then precede my h eeding the call (the call that can not be mistaken) of Initiation? In many cases it will. Magister DeCecco has wo rked with Amn since long before his IV° Recognition, since long before Xem was Uttered, indeed, even before year X's Utterance of Xeper. Many others will have close Working re lationships with their Neters before attempting Initiation into Xem. Many others will not have such relationships. Others will Work closely with a Neter, perhaps for a very long time, only to find themselves cal ling to (or being called by) a different Neter during this Initiation. This is but one easily visible difference between the various individual paths to Xem. Remember NETER XEM WHOSE NAME IS UNKNOWN -- The Neter you find during Initiation may not even have a Name before you find and Name it."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Several Neters are named in the Keys. What will be the Initiate's relationship with these? \"It is each Magician's task to comprehend Truth (Maat) and to Become it.\" (49) Magister Norton 'asked', \"Assuming that we succeed in comprehending Truth, can we actually 'Become' it?\" (50) We can. We must. Most student s of Xem accepted this without Thinking about it, and we worked towards Becoming Maat. But what is Becoming Truth? The methods and symptoms are described in the Keys, but not the essence of this Xeper. A mystic might say \"become one with Maat,\" and mean merging into the Neter of Maat, losing oneself in Maat, becoming voi ce, tool, and part of Maat. The black magician will instead, Become One , with Maat, merging the Neter into the Self, absorbing Maat into the Self. The black magici an will individually participate and Willfully Indulge in the Remanifestation of Maat. As we Become Xem, we Become Neter, mani festing and Remanifes ting that Neter which echoes our Being. And we must Become Maat. That's two Neters ... Having begun our Initiation, we Xeper; we pe rsonify Xepera. We Remanifest Xepera. (51) Are you keeping count? How far each of us goes, how many Neters we each incorporate into our beings, and which Neters, is individually determined. But I suspect all of us will share aspects of many Neters in Xem. Individuality The individual Magician must Work towards Xem. Only individuals can create Xem; the Temple of Set as an organization can not (howev er much it may foster this creation). Xem is a State of Being, and each individual magician w ho Quests for Xem must individually achieve that state of Being. But Xem is also a State of Bei ngs. That State which is Xem changes as the magicians within Xem change. Xem grows with each additional magician that achieves Xem, and Xem grows with the growth of each magician in Xem. Priest Cole proposed that Xem can not be realized by only a single individual, but that it is the task of all of Set's Elect to Become Xem together. (52) I'll illustrate my disagreement through the analogy of the state of Being known as Priest. Becoming Priest is an individual process. We each do it by ourselves (though with help), and we each do it differently. The state of Being of a Priest of Set consists of several different qual ities, symptoms of Set's touch and of individual Xeper. Advanced a nd perceptive Adepts can often recognize when one of their number approaches this state. Prie sts learn to recognize this state in themselves and others. The Magistry Recogni zes Priesthood (they formalize Recognition of Set's chosen one)."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"The Priesthood is a collection of beings known as Priest. The Pr iesthood is a state of beings defined by its members. As each Priest Xepe rs, so does the Priesthood. The Priesthood is significantly different in XXII th an it was in XII, and it will be different in XXXII. This difference is not only in membershi p, but also in quality, in Being. The basic qualification of Prie sthood remains constant -- Priests are those chosen by Set. In addition to other qualifications, Set chooses fo r the Priesthood only those who can join this state of beings, only those who can Xeper along with the Priesthood, only those who through their Xeper can advance the Priesthood. Set chooses those who can do this. Only if the individual will do this, will the individual remain Priest. Otherwise the person is left behind, and becomes not-Priest. Just as individuals become Priest, so too will individuals become Xem. Just as the Priesthood Xepers along with its Priests, so too will Xem Xeper along with its initiates. The symbol of the Black Flame represents the expression of inner Godhood. Xem is Godhood -- our own individual godhood. ... The key is Xeper, for it is the process of transformation in its multiplicity of ways; from this process can arise a truly new being -- the \"unknown god\" within. (53) Xem and Remanifestation Ronald K. Barrett, Magister Templi IV° of the Temple of Set, was Recognized as Magus of Xem within the Aeon of Set on March 24, XIV. He resigned from the Temple of Set on May 31, XVII. James Lewis, Magister Templi IV° of the Temple of Set, was Recognized as Magus of Remanifestation within the Aeon of Set on November 15, XXI at the Set-VII Conclave. Remanifestation is a Word resp ected throughout the Temple of Se t, actively explored and/or investigated by the majority of Setians. Xem is often looked at as history, known more for the legacy of its Magus, his actions and the acti ons of others, than for Xem's teachings. The current state and value of the Word of Xem is best described by Magus Lewis: \"Study and examine Xem as you will – the Word has been replaced and surpassed by [Remanifestation].\" (54) There is nothing important to learn from Xem that can not be learned from Remanifestation. Remanifestation encompasses and surpasses Xe m. The knowledge, benefits, and philosophies of Xem are subsets of th ose of Remanifestation. Similarly, the knowledge, benef its, and philosophies of Newt onian physics are subsets of those found in Einsteinian rela tivity. Students are taught Newtoni an physics before they are taught relativity; they progre ss from the simpler to the more complex and powerful. Likewise, the Aeon of Set progressed from the less complex Xem to the more complex and powerful Remanifestation. (Not to say that Xe m is simple -- the thickness of the writings concerning Xem, including this paper, should help to indicate the complexity of Xem! I state elsewhere in this paper, \"Xeper is unlimited growth of being, Remanifestation is unlimited being in growth, and Xem is unlimited Being.\" This is easy to say, but not so easy to Understand.)"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"The study of Xem can serve as a stepping stone to Remanifestation for many initiates. Only you can decide for yourself whether you will bene fit from the study of Xem in this way. My statements concerning Remanifestation within this paper are not f ound solely within this section. You'll note mention of Remanifestati on scattered throughout th is paper on Xem. The two Words are very closely related. Elsewhere in this paper I state that, \"Xem is that which is to be Remanifest.\" Xem is a measure of our Remanifestation (for those w hose Xeper leads through Xem). I also state, \"Remanifestation is an obvious requirement of Xem and of the Quest of Xem.\" Similarly, Xem is a state of being that can greatly e nhance one's Remanifestation. Xeper through Xem (or the equivalent) is a requirement for the et ernal Remanifestation of the Self. Each Word enhances the other. Need Xem be less complex than Remanifestatio n? Need Xem be repl aced and surpassed? I expect that only Words whose Magi no longer Func tion will suffer from this fate. I expect that Functioning Magi continue to expand their Words, incorporating / complement ing / strengthening any newer Word (of the second type). (55) Xem's currently low position need not be perman ent. Xem's Magus is gone, and never again can the Word achieve primary status, equal to Remanifestation, for only a Magus can give that power to a Word. But stude nts of Xem, Priests and Master s of the Temple, can expand on Xem, strengthening the power of Xem, by s howing how Xem strengthens the Xeper of Setians, how Xem strengthens the Aeon of Set, and how Xem strengthens Remanifestation (and any future Word). This paper is one example of such work. Ma gister DeCecco's works and writings further illustrate the life and power available within Xem. I expect this to be my last formal study of Xem; like Magus Lewis, I am moving onward, past Xem to Remanifestation. I will c ontinue to use Xem as a personal tool of Xeper, and will refer to Xem where appropriate in future works. But I do not expect my future studies to revolve around Xem as this one has. My Quest I joined in the Temple of Set in year XII b ecause of its philosophy of Xeper; I had always believed in and worked for self improvement. When Xem was Uttered, many Setians appla uded, saying that Xeper had commanded us to grow, and now Xem gave us direction. It answered the question \"where?\" I didn't care where at the time: onward and upward was good enough for me. But one question raised another, and I began asking, \"why?\" I ne ver doubted the course, but I began to wonder about the purpose. Once recognized as Priest, I studied the Keys of Xem, a popular and approved path of Xeper. I wrote a commentary on Key # 1 in July, XVI, and on Key # 2 in October. I was working on a commentary of Key # 3 just before the XVII cr isis, after which I shelved all work on Xem, since the subject was too painful for me."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"Key # 3 discusses HarWer, among other topics. HarWer has interested me since my first reading of The Book of Coming Forth by Night , and this project, the analysis of Key # 3, spurred an in-depth study of HarWer. My analysis of HarWer differed significantly from Anubis' statements in Key # 3. My theories about HarWer would not leave me al one. HarWer, and Set's purpose for his gift to mankind, kept filling my thoughts, even during th e time when I gave little thought to Xem. Before the learning process begins, there must be a starting point. There can be no answer to anything unless first there is a question. ... The question must be a quest for knowledge and a quest ion in which the entire Will is concentrated and the Self is conscious. On ly an answer can make a question possible; therefore, every question contains its own answer. (56) My study of HarWer resulted in a message, Blasting Forth by Day or Night (with analysis), published in The Ruby Tablet of Set at the same time as this commentary. You may wish to read that work to give you more background on the following: I state early in this current artic le, \"Xem is reached through a Quest. Each initiate must define his own Question, and must Quest for the Answer.\" I did not think of it in these te rms, but my question was, \"Why is Set interested in our Xeper? What is Set's motivation or goal?\" My quest was to find Set's purpose for us. I have found an answer. I do not claim The Answer , for a) my answer s till needs examination and discussion, verification or refutation from my fellow Setians. More importantly, it needs further substantiation (or refutation) from Set, and further clarifica tion and expansion from both Set and my Higher Self. b) I believe there are other equally valid and important answers. Only Set knows all of Set's motivations and plans. But having found that answer, I have yet another quest. This Quest is mine, and while I expect that I wi ll need others working with me to eventually achieve this goal, this answer and quest is not for everyone. Other Initiates will find other purposes, other answers to their questions. My Quest is well defined by the stat ements of Belial and Leviathan in The Diabolicon . Magus Barrett almost described my Quest when he asked, (57) But why are the Elect so important (like HarWer) to Set? A clue is locked within the ancient symbolism of Set and HarWer uniting the Two L ands. This symbolizes the Great Work in Xem, but it is not the result of the Great Work. It is the fusion of the Principles of Light and Darkness, matter and spirit, etc. The result is no t a combination of the two, but rather a new thing altogether. This Great Work is as delica te as trying to fuse matter and anti-matter, and just as dangerous, hence the warning of Be lial in The Diabolicon. Those Elect who have begun this Great Work are Xem and are Coming Into Being (a new kind of Being) as gods whose Names are unknown. Having completed the Great Work, they will no longer be Xem for they will have transformed into the new Beings or gods whose Names are no longer unknown. They will have beheld Leviathan."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"The Great Work in/of Xem is the uniting of the two lands, the natural and unnatural, the predestined and the unpredictable. Set will not do this, for having modified the natural order to this extent, Set would become the natural order, a state abhorrent to the individuality of Set. I feel that this Great Work is therefore assi gned to Man, to Higher Man, to Xem. We who are the children of two worlds, inhabitants of two worlds, are given the task of making those two worlds one. Why? Our natural universe is antithetical to individuality and free will. This same universe which gives us our bounds so we can identi fy our Selves, continually works for the subjugation and destruction of these Selves. The external, natural universe is necessary. Not only does it allow us to define our Selves against it, but we draw nourishment and stimulation from it. A modified universe, as large, as varied, as nourishing, and as stimulating, and one not quite as antagonistic to individuality and free will, would be a marvelous place in which to live. Set can not create this modified universe, for th en it would not be stimulating to Set, it would remain predictable -- Set would have become th at universe's natural order. Set needs some other willful, independent being to modify th e universe, to modify the universe in unpredictable ways. Higher Man, Remanifesting Xem, can be th e source of such unpredictable change. This description of the Quest does not diffe r significantly from the Great Work accepted by many of our initiates. The difference I see is that almost all Setia ns view Leviathan's challenge as an internal, personal cha llenge, involving the modification of the magician's universe, that subjective unive rse that we can share with each other and with Set. While I recognize the impor tance of this subjective universe, and recognize the importance of our influence over this subjective universe, my Quest is the modification of the physical, objective universe, the universe from which our physical bodies arise, the universe which by its mechanical nature is antagonistic to free will, to magic, and to Set. Set can not replace this natural order without becoming the new na tural order. But with help, I can. With help, I Will. “So let it [the Black Flame] come finally to man, who shall overcome the great balance and bring to the Flame a change, for in supremacy it shall become Red with the perfection of the Will of man.” (58) Higher Man shall overcome the st asis of Osiris, changing not onl y Self, not only the Universe, but even the Black Flame. (59) With minor changes and continuing development, these thoughts have been my theories and my hypothetical quest since year XVII. On June 13, XXII, while drafting this article for The Ruby Tablet of Set , I actively accepted the personal res ponsibility of filling this need, of serving this purpose. I was immediately filled with such joy that tears came to my eyes."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"I turned away from my computer and towards my altar. In formal ritual, in the middle of the afternoon, I pledged myself to this Quest. Many paths lead onward from Xem. Though I have not yet found Xem, I have found one such path past Xem. I expect that several of Xem will join me on this path, will join me in the creation of a new universe, created through our combined Wills, with our combined individualities, a universe which, with its se crets and surprises can be stimulating to all magical beings.

Lewis IV° Date:  (unknown)  HTML Revision: Jun 07, 1999 CE Subject:  Xem  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Key #1 Key #1 lays ground rules for the Initiation into Xem , and is an introduct ion telling us how, what, where, and who can and shall be Elect to Xem . It was not written to confuse with vague meanings. In fact, like the Book of Coming Fort h By Night, it is written in the plainest possible language, and like the Book of Coming Forth By Night , its meanings are apparent only for those who Work to Know what those meanings are. Let us examine some of those Truths. To expect to simply understand and Understand Xem in its entirety would be a serious error. It takes an Awareness of multiple factors and an acute knowledge of the Self to comprehend the Xem of the moment ... and the very second it can be described in detail [i.e.: \"pinned down\"], it's no longer Xem . Just as the quest will call for a constant search, so the knowledge gained and utilized will impact on the Initiate and change his view, Will, Xeper , Heart, quest, and the Xem he seeks. That Xem will not stay put in one pla ce can be maddening. If it ever seems to do so, I suggest an immediate intensive analysis of the Being for a judgmental error. There is no doubt that the Living Essence b ecomes poisonous once one attempts to double back. I've never tried wading back to the Osiria n shore, but then, I'm alien in a mundane world and have enough to do bearing my Flame amid sh ells to try going back. Do this: Try to imagine yourself no longer being Setian and be ing unable to rid yourself of the knowledge of humanity's emptiness. It is one of Hell's Curses on those who become traitors. [\"I deliver them to the examiners from whose guard there is no escape.\"] Xeper and Maat are obvious as the cornerstones of this Æon. For Xeper to be Xeper , Maat must be present or there is not Xeper but rather the massing of a mutation. Xeper + Maat = evolution; Xeper - Maat = mutation. An example: Ev er had a close friend who knew just enough about the T.S. to attempt something like Xeper for the fun of it? Most of these think there's no need to go to the trouble of being in Maat or even know what Maat is ... so you know the rest of the story. Usually, we wind up watching the fireworks, because dilettantes tend to be poor listeners. That the Will must not relax puts a new slant on that old saying about there being no rest for the wicked. I suppose from the point of view of the children of Osiris, we're quite wicked in refusing to accept rest and preservation, but that 's their problem, not ours. Not relaxing the Will has tremendous benefits, one of which is that the Xeper of the Being accelerates as it expands ... and expands as it accelerates and— ad infinitum. Waiting and being sure not to wa it too long and how to avoid th e latter: There is a word you need to keep in mind in understa nding this, and that word is Initiation . Remembering that Xeper is a constant thing, Initiati on should be seen as an equally continuing thing as one can Come Into Being for a very short space of time if Initiation is not utilized. [The Xeper would probably last about one second afte r the Initiation is rejected.] There is a thing about an Init iatory experience which permits no overlooking of it. The new understanding gained by it alerts the Magician to the fact that, hey, something happened! You might or might not be able to maintain a cool composure sufficient to know it as what it is, but a realization will come about, as it must due to the Xeper of it."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Some Initiatory experiences almost sneak up on us; others give undeniable signs of their impending arrival. These might be a restlessness, an urge to enter Ritual, an extrasensory awareness of something coming, or whatever. Th e Initiatory call sends its vibrations ahead, and those vibrations become stronger as the In itiate becomes ready to face the Gate. What happens if you try too soon? A misconception is possible, though speaking from personal experience it's quite likely you'll come out of the experience feeling something was just beyond your fingertips. This result is a good thi ng to undergo, because it sends most people back to the quest with a determination to find out what the Hell is going on. 1 The actualization of Xem is the direct opposite of those things Magus Barrett lists as detrimental to the quest. [\"To hesitate, to rati onalize in human terms, to feel negativeness or fear or lack of confidence...\"] Action, awaren ess, and positive assertion are the keys to speeding one toward Xem . Conscious awareness is imperativ e as we quest forth, due to the fact there are myriad ways open to us. Beyond this, there is the awareness of the main direction to be taken, and then there is the Work for it. \"The Elect who shall Work toward Xem must also know that alone the Work cannot be completed.\" I refer you to Magistra Sinclair's Alone and the message of Being contained in it. Each of us is distinctly Alone, but this isn't what Magus Barrett is talking about. There is a difference between \"alone\" and \"Alone,\" that diffe rence in this context being that each of us, like Set, is acutely Alone and singular in our individual nobility. The Great Work calls for our Working in concert [ not unison], and I really can't figure out a way to allow one alone to act in concert with nothing else. Again, the concert is the Initiate, other Initiates, and Set—all impacting on the Work. The paragraph regarding the dange rs of taking flaws along on the Journey is an important one. Remember that Xeper is going to magnify the whole Being, and that will include any flaw. A bit of thought on the future of \"What will I Manifest?\" will be helpful when it comes to spotting and eliminating impurities. I think Xem calls for an innocence of the Being, and Ipsissimus Aquino goes into this in The Dark Side. 2 Please read it. The Keys stress Work, and if you're like me, you'll sit down, read a book not on the recommended list, or flip on T.V., and suddenl y feel something akin to guilt. There was a time this was driving me bananas until → I re-examined my concepts. Life, my students, is a Work. Being is a Work. And as in all things, we balance carefully to avoid burnout. So sure— read a book, take naps, watch a movie on T.V., take pleasure from the humans. Indulge and indulge. Only you can say how much is too mu ch, and believe me, if you go overboard, you'll know it. There is but one great Truth, and that is the Truth of Being. Be yond that, all else is what one does with the Being. Yet there are certain ru les, and on these depend whether one can pass Maat and enter Xem 's portals. Mutants and Gods seek Xem , but only the Gods are of Maat and only they possess the vision to see Maat. If Xem cannot be taught, then the im plication in that phrase is that it can be found in ways others than reading sections A, B, C, & D. The Key goes further to say it must be recognized, realized, and then actualized. How does one unde rstand it? In answer, let me share with you one of my cleaner parables concerning the seeker who asked to be spoon-fed: \"Anx-f-Apep! What is Life?\""},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"\"It is Being.\" \"Anx-f-Apep! What is death?\" \"It is un-Being.\" \"Anx-f-Apep! Is this true?\" \"It is.\" \"Anx-f-Apep! How do you know this to be true?\" \"D'ye want a clip on the jaw?\" The new language necessary to understanding Xem is another elusive thing. Like everything else in the Æon, the language is a constantly evol ving thing, and only the Working mind and Heart will be able to keep up with it. The reference to the \"inner ey e\" suggests a concept of a new Being, formed by Work and Will. An eye is created, an eye that can See a nd direct further building of the Temple of the Higher Man. And, as Magus Barrett mentions, ther e is an art to the pow er of the inner eye. He also speaks of the symbols of essential thoug ht and the intelligence of the Heart. We seek essences as we're not content with corruptions , and the jewels found thus far are more than sufficient to justify the time and trouble taken and that which will be taken. As we become more proficient in changing our standard ways of thinking [the mind feels very comfortable with fixed things], it is obvious there is a gr eat deal to this known as Being. There is an enormous amount to this known as Being! It woul d all be easier to s ee if it didn't insist on always changing, but as it does, we might as well accept the fact and go after it. And now—to that word I've used here and there thus far: QUEST . To pin down the exact point at which the quest begins is rather hard, because quest s, like Initiation, often begin before there's a consciousness of what is occurring. The Heart will already be at work wondering and seeking when the Intellect begins to express the input it has received. The Intellect is of great value to us, but more im portant is the Heart, wh ich is the foundation of Being. Yet the Heart totally alone cannot push one to Xem . It requires a balanced flow of input to the Heart from the Inte llect and back to the Intellect which in turn receives the new input and again sends back to the Heart ad infinitum . While all this is going on, the balanced Being is heading serenely Xem ward, concentrating all its Will on the task. Another thing quite obvious is that we are not rebuilding Khem. The Houses there are dust, and the creation of new ones will be both mo re beneficial and more Magical than the construction of copies. Never try to make a copy—it's only an imitation of the real thing. What we're doing is looking for the ancient kno wledge, not the facade, which is what a copy would be. Two quotes: \"It should also be known that the knowledge ga ined and the benefit thereof will be limited to the intensity with which it was aspired toward.\" (Magus Barrett)"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"\" Xem is only as it becomes.\" (Magus Barrett) and two others: \"For what a man sows, that he will also reap.\" (The Enemy) \"Please bear in mind that you're going to get out of this what you put into it.\" (Magister Lewis) With the Coming Into Being of Per-t, these seem to be pretty well ve rified—even the quote from the Enemy. And if we've come this far, I can see little to stop us from absorbing the knowledge and conversation of Per-t and its new implications of Xeper and Xem . I suggest that Infinity is our goal. The two final paragraphs of Key #1 are invitatio ns to Self-expansion. We are again told the how, why, and what of appr oaching the Initiation to Xem . \"... the step that separates but does not divide.\" I ask you to consider here the Two Lands, both balanced 3 and going home to Xem . Key #2 Key #2 begins with a subtle invitation to go questing and to find the order and orders. The second sentence [\"Just what these (orders) are de pends on what the initiates create with their Wills.\"] gives direction and instruction on findi ng the order(s), and I ask you to pay attention to the mention of creation. In your mind's eye, try to see the Order of Shetat, the Order of Belial, and the Order of Atmu-s et-t. What are they? For that matter, what is the Order of Apep? What is it doing? As you can see ... ah, yo u'd like an answer to the Order of Apep? All right—the Order of Apep is Awakening and tr aveling the spiral. It is maintaining a ∞ shape as it exerts its powers on Infinity. It does this for itself and that it may receive assistance from and give assistance to the other Elect. It is fl exing its Magical muscles and effecting creation and change. Now—back to where we were. What the Orders will do as their individual and concerted Work will depend on the zeal and Work of the In itiate—in other words, what you create with your Will. And this will be done ... when? Ag ain quoting from the Key, \"...nor can/should Xem be created by any other than those initiated into Xem 's mysteries and secrets.\" That tells the who —does it give a when ? Yes. Continuing Work is cons tructive and construction, when coupled with Xeper , will equal creation. That creative factor is a necessary part of Xem 's mysteries and once the flaws are, or are being, uprooted, an ordering in and of one's Self comes about. Guess how many steps that is from Xem 's mysteries and secrets? Not many, but remember that just as we're constantly changing, so Xem also stays on the move. How does one manifest an abstraction? Furthe r yet, how does one go about transforming the Highest imaginable form of Being? Don't try it— do it ! Ordinarily, such a task would be impossible, but we bear the Black Flame, there by being able to sneer at impossibilities. Key #2 was written prior to the Uttering of Per-t, and so we have a new view on manifesting abstractions; I suggest that ab stractions are manifested th rough bringing into Being the Understood concepts of Higher Man through Man ifestation. Accomplishing this won't be the signal to let it rest: the manifested Man ifestation/creation is then in a situation familiar to us. It must continue to apply its knowledge in a search for the Higher. Sound overwhelming? Sure, but we're more or less restricted to the lim its of our physical bodies at present. Bear in"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"mind, however, that these bodies have got to we ar out sometime, and it would be senseless to stop questing simply because the body can no longer function. What we are is Being, not primarily body, though I must say we have so me nice ones of those among us. And yes, I mean male and female. We've spoken of Initiation in Pyramid-XIX, and Key #2 again points out its importance. Yet here another facet of Initiation is presented: the ordeal aspect. An ordeal is a trial is a thing calling for the facing of one's Self is not fun and games! It calls fo r a preparation that involves severe searching of the Being to eliminate all which is unworthy of Higher states. The ordeal of change is not going to simply come about due to wearing an inverted Pentagram, as the Key later indicates. It calls for awareness and action and a tearing down of walls which would block the path to Xem . It is one of the continuing great steps in personal evolution, as Magus Barrett aptly describes it. The th ings we have to learn are the theory and dynamics of taking steps; these are found in the hi dden and mundane keys spoken of. Keys are all about us, from the words of the Book of Coming Forth by Ni ght to observing the humans and doing not as they do—look about and within yourself. Set has said, \"The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance...,\" and the ways one can apply that to the Self are myriad. In the Xem Working, it was the heart of the aspirant versus Maat's feather, and this is the symbol of moment to moment examin ation of the Self by the Self. Moment to moment? Yes, if not more frequent . True, we might not be consciously seeing it so, but just try going off balan ce and listen to those internal alarms start sounding. Of course, you're not forced to pay attenti on to those alarms, but there's a full list of those who ignored them to remain in trees rather than pursue the Path. Magus Barrett speaks of this judgement/initia tion in the singular, and I've been talking plurality. There is no contradiction here, though, because the Opener of the Way is describing the Great Initiation of the Self facing the Self in order to pa ss through the porta ls of Truth. I am emphasizing that one cannot expect to take it easy after one ordeal. I can assure you, as Magister Seago has pointed out a bout the IV°, the trails and dangers are cons tant. [Perhaps it's that the IV° sees and Understand s these dangers with greater clar ity that the panic is not given in to, and falls are less frequent than one woul d expect in the face of the enormity of our tasks.] Famous Wrong Move Number 131: Waltzing Gaily Through the Pylon of Initiation. Initiation, as we know, is a fiery thing and not always the most pleasant of experiences, though it is one of the most necessary ones. That it could seem ominous strikes me as being quite true, considering that what one faces is the sum total of what one has brought into Being up to that point. Think of that carefully. Al so, try picturing a Magic mirror that will show exactly what is ... and remember what is going to be seen is reality. I presume the experience could be seen as unimportant or ludicrous, but my only reference point is that of personal experience, and that was/is no laughing matter. And going along in that vein, we come to th e quote from the Xem Working: \"Higher Man must conquer fear.\" Being faced with fear will leave open two choices: the constructive transformation or the regression Magus Ba rrett speaks of. Remember this from Pyramid-XIX ? \"Try to imagine yourself no longer being Setian and being unable to rid yourself of the knowledge of humanity's emptiness.\""},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"For those who choose to regress, there is the problem of the Black Flame and the unpleasant thing it will have become. That the Flame can be extinguished I have no doubt, though it seems the energy expended in putting it out coul d be used more constructively within the Temple environs. The same holds true for making the Flame go nova and destroying everything. A waste, but one will do what one Wills oneself to do. There are a goodly number of things in this Æon that must be experienced by each Initiate, and Initiation serving as a shield against im purities is one of these. Considering what Xeper and Maat are and what Initiation is, it is Ma gically sound logic that an aberrancy would be prevented from taking root. N.B. → this applies only if Xeper continues to occur. We have a test for I°'s aspiring to the II°; why not one for the Order of Set aspiring to Xem ? It's close enough to the same thing, isn't it? No. There is a vast gul f between where you are and where an Initiate in the late I°/early II° st age is. There is also a great deal of difference between finding Θελημα and Knowing Xeper to reach for Xem . It is possible for the III°+ to know who's ready for the Red Star due to that something extra we posse ss—the Sense of Set. But arranging the base e nds of existence for one's pleasure is n't quite the same as maintaining one's Self apart from the natural universe. It ma y be that one day a test for III° will come about, though I sort of doubt it. The entry to Xem 's mysteries involves a merciless ordeal of the Self, therefore, a form examination would be one Self speaking to anot her Self trying to fit in. And in that sense, it would be wrong. Se t himSelf says, \"Now let the Setian shun all recitation, for the text of another is an afront to the Self.\" [O f course, he's referring to the stasis that comes about through a ritual done w ithout meaning, but the le ssons of the Book of Coming Forth by Night are legi on and are applicable in a ny number of situations.] Are the facilities of XemSet sti ll available if one wishes to un dergo the trial there? I presume this could be arranged, though one should ch eck with Magus Barrett before going up the Mountain. 4 Wherever is chosen, it wi ll still be a thing done Alone. The following paragraph deserves to be quoted in full: \"Those approaching Xem through their own evolution will r ecognize the signals that will call them to initiation. Only those who have conque red fear should provoke the ordeal as stated before. The call to initiation is impossible not to recognize, fo r it comes as a longing, an inner need demanding to be fulfilled. It shall seem as a need for inner action and there will be an unceasing impulse to force an esoteric issue. The aspirant will feel an obsession to know truth and to Be. This will be unignorable.\" Note that those approaching Xem make that approach \" through their own evolution \"; the name of that process of evolution is Xeper , the Word of the III°. It follows that, excepting the option of stasis, there is no wa y around the ordeal of Initiation. Regardless of whether it is seen as a shining Gate or haunted cavern, it remains a necessity. \" Only those who have conquered fear should provoke the ordeal.... \" Remembering that what one will meet is the Self as it Is, I think this advice/statement sound and wise. What is this \"fear\" that we should overcome it? Fear is a weakening agent, one th at permits hesitation, rationalization, and compromise—all the things that do not lead to Xem . You are advised against the obviously dangerous (such as playing with rattlers ... even I'm reluctant to do that!); the \"fear\" that is referre d to is that which would make one turn back; perhaps playing with rattlesnakes is safer."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"There is going to be no way around answering the Initiatory call, unless one does opt for stasis. It is an inevitable ordeal which comes to be due to using Xeper . Does one have to undergo it? Consider the tree-dwellers. Is it possible to succeed? Consider the Magistri Templi, the Magi, the Ipsissimus. Quod erat demonstrandum . The length of time the Initiatory experience w ill take is a highly individualized thing. In trying to pin myself down for an answer to th e exact amount of time involved, I usually wind up asking myself if it's further to Ft. Wort h or by bus. Speaking personally, I can recall Initiatory experiences which increased in thei r intensities, and one night that permitted no escape from unveiling the mirror in Ritual. Those Magics encounter ed varied from a test of the harder right vs. the easier wrong to visual phenomena invol ving the Scales themselves. It was a pitiless time and often a painful one, but one I wouldn't trade for worlds. It was, you see, an absolute necessity. It further took mo re than one night. How long will your Initiation take? Well, Ft. Worth or by bus? Only you will be ab le to supply the answer to that particular question/quest. Further quests → what is going to be revealed of one's relation to man, Xem , the Neteru, the Work, and the price of failure. Another quest → why see this? [\"Why not?\" is unsatisfactory as an answer.] My feelings on this are that on e is in the presence of Maat, the Truth of which Is in the Being, and is therefore present in all time. Yet this is not predestination—that occurs only as we form it from minute to minute and th erefore is not waiting as a fixed thing. What you may glimpse, then, is not an unchanging thing. It is a view from an alien universe ... yet not entirely alien. [Let me in one way make eas ier and more complicated that last sentence by saying there is more than one Universe : from which does your view originate?] \" The Gates of Xem are opened to those who would s ee and shall not be closed again. \" There is a certain key which opens the Gates, and that key is Will through Willed Xeper . Note the words \"those who would see.\" What we have here is another way of saying the Gates open to those who Will passage through them. Not want to go through them, not would like to go through them, and not that it's Setian-socially acceptable to go through them, but that the act is inevitable to those who force the inner issue involving the Self and its Xeper ing in Xem 's direction. And now: Who propped the Gate open a nd why? As the Gates are those to Xem , we can look to the smiling face of the Jackal. The why of it is intertwined w ith his Task as Magus V°; his own Work led to it as he was schooled in the Word by Set and, like our own Initiation, Opening the Way to the Gate(s) was another inevita bility due to that Work. It is also a Gift, though not of the platter variety. The paragr aph continues by saying what Initiation is → \" the directing of one's own Powers of Darkness inward \" in order to weigh wh at one Is, an act done by \" open[ing] the gates of Self. \" And there is the source and an swer to the question in the only place it can be found. The only place? Ye s. What you're seeking is the Truth of your Self, not that of others. One observation I'd like to offer here is that in no place does anyone give an effort-free guarantee. If Initiation ever appears to hold out a silver platter, pl ease look down. The chances are you'll probably note your hand grasping your ankl e, caught in the act of pulling your leg. Key #1 plainly states that the Keys cannot teach and that Xem cannot be taught; it does not say Xem cannot be experienced. There is an Op ened Way, and it is up to the individual Initiate to locate it."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Initiation brings about the new dimension of Be ing that was not prior to the ordeal. Magus Barrett uses the words \"born into a new dimens ion,\" and indeed, it is a birth process. Ready for the bad news? In order to live, you have to die a little. Now—more good news. What will die will be that which you upr oot, that which has no place in Xem 's realm. So ... die a little. It's only going to hurt for a short while, and your Flame will grow all the stronger in the new space given it. What you're going to see in thos e new areas of Being is the ultimate freedom that Xeper gives to those who utilize it. It's we ll worth tearing down any throne not of Xem to see the vastness open to expl oration and what can be. The concept and reality of the Neter to be wo rked with can be disconnecting at times. Pale, proud Apep has taught me that lesson time and ti me again, and it might one day happen that I'll learn to expect the unexpected in Worki ng with him. Finding the appropriate Neter isn't the easiest of tasks, as there is but one major form \"right\" for the one questing, and only he or she can find it. Ritual Work is going to be of great assistance in finding that \"right\" Neter, and once you've found it [or once it has found you], be pr epared to Work. I think that finding that Neter is going to involve any number of factors. Those will be intuition, awareness, a sense of almost being aware of it, a deep-seated attraction, etc. It is worth remembering that the Neter's importance lies in its function, as Magus Ba rrett points out. Though the name of the Neter isn't of prime importance, I'd hate to see so mething like an \"Osiris\" being brought among us; it wouldn't be the name—it would be what the Neter would try to do. Of course now, that's another rather extreme example, but it illustrates what the Key is saying. If accomplishing the Initiation into Xem is the start of the quest [\"... the beginning of the actual quest...\"], then what have we been questin g and Working toward up to the present? Just this → Initiation into Xem and its mysteries. Note I use the word \"mysteries.\" To Understand mysteries, one needs to be a mystic, and a well-balanced one at that. Once one has undergone the ordeal of Initiation and has been born into that new dimension spoken of, one is able to perceive the flow of events both Magical and mundane in a far clearer way due to one's perspective . There is no end unless an end is chosen. If everything happened to be uniform [and dull and drab] within this Æon, we might then reasona bly expect to Work on Work A, proceed to Work B, etc., and end up with initiation into Xem and then kiss each other goodnight. Period. This is not the way it works. Each Working is going to expand the Magician's concepts, and thus enable her or him to incorporate elemen ts of Being previous Magicians never dreamed possible, and for a distinct reason: we accomplis h ends, not endings. We also constantly seek new ends to accomplish in our travel up the Xeper spiral toward Al Xem y. It is a world with no ending. While the challenge of Leviathan is formidable, it is not impossible. “... Leviathan shall yield to none other t han the final master of the Universe.” “... if thou would presume to realize what neither Heaven nor Hell may effect...” Who is the \"final master of the Universe?\" What is that which \"neither Heaven nor Hell may effect?\" That final master is you . Now for the fine print: the final master will be you if you make it so by Self-order. It will be you master ing the Universe which is you realized in the Higher form. Only in this way will the daemon of continuity and ageless existence be utilized."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Indeed, this goes along with \" realizing what neither Heaven nor Hell may effect,\" through Self-creation. [ Id est : no one's going to do it for you, baby.] The Task of a Magus is to Utter his Word. The task of the Hearers is to Work and make the abstract concrete. To make Xem a concrete reality, the Gates of Initiation are an absolute necessity. The while Initiation into the Gates of Xem will enable one to Understand those mysteries and secrets, there will be a conspicuous lack of silver platters. Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is spoken of. [If anyone hasn't read it, please do so.] Her-Bak also brings out the outer and i nner aspects of the ancient temple s, and as in C.S. Lewis' land of The Last Battle , the further in you go, the bigger everything gets. Along with getting bigger, it becomes more complex. Th ere is a point I'd like to again bring out: In this Universe which will expand and grow infinitely more complex, you are going to be Alone, even while Working in concert with the Othe rs. I had better provide anothe r bit of explanation before you elect to commence feelings of perplexity. Do not commence perplexity. When you achieve the perspective which permits you to perceive the enormity of your Universe, you will also have achieved the Self-order necessary to mainta in Being there. Too high a State of Being to be attained? Well, how did Priesthood stri ke you back in late I°/early II° days? 5 But there must/will always be the two aspects of Xem . The known and the secret serve to 1. allow utilization of that gained thus far to 2. open the secret and make it the known ... which will then open the way to seeking newe r secrets. There is no state of Being that permits discontinuing the quest, un less one counts stasis—which is hardly what we're talking about. What we are talking about is Initia tion, Evolution, and Being. Along with the quote from The Satanic Rituals , consider this from The Diabolicon: “For with no purpose the force of the mind mu st fail, and the blind insanity of Godly paralysis would embrace all things forever.” Key #3 Since you wear the Black Star of Set, you can ap preciate that where we are now is far, far beyond what might have been expected or foreseen in the Year X. In II°-2 6 , then-Magister Aquino had this to say: \"No more non-member subscriptions or non- member affiliations under any guise. Anyone who expects to get anything out of this organization will have to join it 100%. No more honorary Priesthoods. No Magist ers or Priests who don't do a damned thing. Each new member will be expected to produce appropr iate evidence during his initial year of membership that he is practicing Satanism fo rthrightly and unashamedly. Otherwise he will not be permitted to renew his membership, fee or no fee. The same holds true for each Satanist of each degree for each year. And the standards will get tougher as the degrees get higher.\" Those words and acts opened such paths and po ssibilities that, by the Ye ar XIV, a new Magus was able to say this:"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"\"The components of this complex are distin ct in their Functions and are intricately interwoven. The components are the T.S., the Temple of Set, the Order of Set, the Initiatory Degrees, the Council of Nine, the High Prie sthood, Majestic Man or King/Pharaoh, and Xem .\" Key #2 brought out that there is a balance betwee n the seen and the unsee n and so it is with the T.S. Inc. and the veil it presents to the in itiated. Magus Barrett describes the \"T.S. (Inc.)\" as \"... the manifestation of the Temple of Set in the temporal or mundane world.\" Brief, but it says a great deal when one is on this side of the Temple walls. The T.S. Inc. does a number of things → it fulfills the legal needs of the religious organization, assists its own, and makes the Temple of Set more or less invisible to th e bungled and botched while being capable of striking a strangely familiar note within the sleeping (potential) Elect. Priestess Moffatt could, I think, speak bett er on the Executive Directorship than I, 7 but having her on my Pyramid has given rather good insights into a Magician's way of dealing with the pressures of the mundane and Magical—and she' s right in the middle of both. Under Priestess Moffatt's guidance, the Temple of Set is moving far faster than it would move without her, and personally I think she's great! [Because she's on my Pyramid? Partly, but also because she is one of the Majesties of Set. You gentlemen s hould know that I have a great deal of pride in you, also.] Going back to the Executive Direct orship, try imagining the Temple of Set without it. Enough said. \"... the abstraction behind the manifestation,\" \" ... the TRUE House of Set.\" We are the Temple of Set. We are the Temples of Set. There is an intricate relationship between the macrocosmic Temple and the microcosmic Temples, and it is a relationship which constantly changes due to the microcosmic's effect on the macrocosmic and the macrocosmic's effect on the microcosmic. A Word that is ve ry important in all this is Xeper . There are other organizations of a religious nature, but none ar e currently able to evolve in quite the way the Temple of Set is doing. Most of them have leaders more or less capable of bindi ng their organizations together, and most present noble sounding reasons for their existence, but one of the things lacking in them is Xeper . Xeper , it will be remembered, must have Maat or it is no longer evolution. Rather, it beco mes a mutation—not but ↓ . The abstraction work s on principles of Truth, and we have evidence of manifestation. The Office of the High Priest of Set is one of great honor and respons ibility. Both our High Priests have undergone tremendous pressures from a number of areas, and both have experienced being set up as a targ et for the slings and arrows of departing members who were sure they knew more about the High Priesthood than the High Priest. 8 Further, both High Priests have fulfilled/are fulfilling the Tasks of th eir Office in Maat, as is expected of the High Priest by Set and his Temple. For, you see, we have honor among us. As I indicated before, the High Priest often gets a goodly amount of flak because of his decisions, though the flak has slacked off in fr equency of late. I know—I don't always agree with everything Magus Barrett de cides, and neither did all of then-Magus Aquino's decisions strike me as just right on first hearing them. However—and this is important—neither Michael Aquino nor Ronald Barrett is in the habit of talking merely to hear a self-generated voice. When the High Priest speaks, he speaks as the High Priest of Set and is responsible to the Prince of Darkness himSelf. No one, leas t of all Magus Barrett, expects blind obedience from any Setian ... but it is helpful to remember that a decision from 4022 Broadway is not"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Ron Barrett talking—it is the voice of Magus Ronald Barrett V°, who must answer to Set for his actions and therefore weighs them carefully before speaking. I do not envy him his Office. The Nine ... those people who are always going off to meetings at Conclaves and nodding to one another in crowds and taki ng the opportunity to occasionally drive the rest of the Temple up the walls with curiosity. 9 Quite seriously 10 the role of the indivi dual Councillors and the collective Council is a unique experience/Work. Key #3 describes it in this way: \"The Council of Nine is the 'heart' of the Temp le of Set, which advises the High Priest by its 'Sense of Set' or Maat. The Nine could be compared to the higher emotional center because the Council advises by higher Senses , feelings, and intuitions.\" Using these Higher Senses is a de licate matter, because the lowe r senses must not intrude and influence a Councillor's decision. Set can reach on ly the Higher parts of us ... and only those Higher parts can reach in and then out to Set; therefore, any decision reached by any Councillor [or the Council] which is not reached by the finest Higher Senses cannot reflect the Will of Set. Any other way leads only to sa ndbox politics and games, not to the Ageless Intelligence. Key #3 goes further to say \"The Council of Nine, then, is the 'reactive' princi ple to the 'active' principle of the High Priest of Set; the two create a principle of balance.\" 11 From having observed the C9 in action, it is readily appare nt that the Council is the \"reactive\" to the High Priest's \"active.\" Which leads to a question ... why does it perform so? And to another: how? Why : As far as I know, there's no totally perfect person in our ranks; it would indicate an Initiate incapable of further Xeper —hence, one in stasis and no Setian. Since we're fortunate enough not to have this problem among us, we'r e fortunate enough not to have all the answers = we've got to Work/work for what we do = somewhere along the line, an error is going to creep in. Now, as none of the Magi of my ac quaintance have laid claim to omniscience, I presume the V° to be capable of mistakes. In the case of the High Priesthood, this could become disastrous; enter the Council of Nine , a body of nine highly evolved Magicians whose special duty it is to guard the Æ on. This it does by finely tuning its Higher faculties [the Sense of Set] and responding in a way that in no uncertain terms reflects the Ma at of the decision before it . That is the \"why\" (and part of the \"how\")—establishi ng that balance which is a necessity when acting in Truth. How : On the present Council, we have one V°, thr ee III°, and five IV°. [The Masters of the Temple win again!!] Consider the power of Knowledge held by those three, the immense fund Understood by the five, and the Vision of that one. Now, pool those while maintaining their individual Selves. The Nine together then have over fifty years of Temple of Set experience— a great deal of Heart. [Think of the Nine as standing in a circle fa cing one another. I can see Magistra Sinclair directly across from me, and Magistra Bast can see Magus Norton, who is directly across from her, etc. Having this visualized, remember that no one wears blinde rs, and that my vision also curves over to Priest Bushey, who can also see Priest Moffatt, and, well, you get the idea."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"The \"how\" is also answered by the wide rang e of vision along with the link which exists among the Nine, enabling that body to Function as the Guardians ... those who respond in and through Maat to that which will affect the future of the Temple of Set.] \"The Order of Set consists of all III° Initiates....\" The III° Initi ate is in a rather good position in a number of ways, particularly Grade-wise. There are distinct differences between all the Degrees, but I think the III° is on e of the most important in that it is between the I°/II° and the IV°/V°, and VI° being another thi ng altogether due to the \"own very Self\" significance. This being in the middle of the Grades has a very great advantage: it's easier to recall what the I° and II° are like, and it's also possible, through the force of Will, to comprehend IV° and V° thought, though it's difficult to sustain for long pe riods that \"push\" to Understanding when one is of the III° Priesthood. 12 \"Separate but not divided\" → these words are capable of boggli ng the mind. But why? Part of the answer is that it came from a Magus, one who conceptualizes that which has not before been clearly spoken or comprehended; hen ce, it is a new idea and requires work to Understand. Yet, the Two Lands the Key speaks of could be no less than the dual aspects of the Temples of Set. Visible/invisible, light/darkne ss, manifest/abstract, Ra/Set ... at the risk of being repetitive, it seems to cal l for a precise sense of balance because these are the planes of Being . Remember that while these are separated, th e fact they are not divided indicates each will impact on the other constantly. HarWer, the Living Horus. As I see Key #3 , the subject of HarWer is explained with a clarity that is quite pellucid. Return to the Key and begin reading, star ting with the paragraph beginning, \"The placing of HarWer within our Setian Philosophy...\" to the final paragraph of Key #3. Like the demon in Niven & Pournelle's Inferno , \"I really don't know how to make it plainer.\" Which translates to → I can't make it plainer for you but you can make it plainer for you. The Keys will not teach, but what they will do is open the way for breaking down one's own barriers to understanding. And on the other side of those barri ers? Actually, there's this horrible devil with a tr ident and meathooks, just itching to chunk you straight in the lake of fire. 13 Key #4 Five Keys have been written, and we're getting a certain expertise in the new language. To refresh the memory, the reference to the new language is this: \"There shall be ancient and occult language used with new meanings and a new language used with ancient and occult meanings.\" (Key #1) Why should it be like remember ing, this thing of approaching and absorbing the new language? To answer that one, we have to seem to veer off topic to a s ubject near and dear to the heart of most of the occult world: Reinca rnation. As I once told you many centuries back, there's no such thing as reincarnation but there is such a thing as survival of the Being's Highest parts. And that is the key to the \"why\" of the question. The El ect Setian Magician is going to build and fortify those parts of himself which are the finest, mo st precise, and highest aspects of Being; these can be stopped only by opting to give in to the Greater Law at the individual Initiate's own choice . Just as the choice can be that of giving in, so it can also be that of not giving in. Mere flesh, as is, cannot endure forever; 14 what can endure is the"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Highest Essence—a matter of alpha , not omega ;. Now—back to why this new language gives one a sensation of remembering. The Book of Coming Forth by Night remains a curi ous document. If I didn't have personal evidence of its Truths, and had I not observed the evidence shown by ot hers who have dared to take its challenges, I could dismiss it as a rather nice piece of writing by Ipsissimus Aquino. As is, I have proof in my own Understanding, so I know (not \"believe\") Set to be the author of it. The Book of Coming Forth by Night was not me rely dictated with only the exact moment of dictation in mind. It was carefully prep ared by Set for Setians and has long-range implications—witness finding \"a new twist to something we thought so familiar.\" Just how long-range is the Book of Coming Forth by Night ? That's asking just where its limits extend to, and the answer rests with you. I don't think an y of us will let it be too limited ... no, not at all. \" Symbolism is a visible form of abstract (magi cal and philosophical) principles, qualities, and functions, awakening within us an Understanding (consciousness) of Being and of an already possessed knowledge contai ned in our true Being .\" To learn to think in symbols is a difficult task; it is also a necessary one. Without thinking in the symbolic, one cannot Understand and experience the abstract. It'll make it pretty hard to Manifest them, too. [Manifest the abstract? How else to make it an enduring part of the Being?] Thinking in symbolism is a lot of hard work and can be maddening. So why do it? For one thing, thinking in symbols is contagious both with in the Self and with others, thereby leading to new areas of exploration. For another, the way symbols are comprehended is highly individualized, thereby challenging and strengthening the individual Initiate and the Temple of Set. 15 Xeper , to be Xeper , must be continuous. It must also have a means of being continuous. Symbolic thought provides the means quite well by presenting some of the most tantalizing concepts and examples and then leaving it up to the Initiate to attain a consciousness of what has been suspected and/or glimpsed. Indee d, as Key #4 says, \"Symbolic thought-form can ... both excite and express Xeper ,\"—which leads to having a firmer grasp on what is known and finding nuances not previously seen and again, ad infinitum . Symbols can be subtle in their messages, and something somewhere is keyed to comprehending those messages. Again, these are long-range things. It would have done little good for the Book of Coming Forth by Night to state verbatim that Xeper would be followed by Xem and Per-t, even if it would have been possi ble for Set to remember those Words. Why \"little good?\" Because there would have been no effort put forth, and therefore no attainment. No symbolism, nothing for the Being to quest fo r. No quests, no Majesty of Set. No Set, no Temple of Set. Or, as Magus Nort on once said, \"No guts, no glory.\" Are symbolisms limited to shapes on the walls of Egypt's ancient tombs? Of course not. As the Keys say, symbolism has been in use since I A.S., and its limits are only set by the Initiate's perception and the Initiate's percep tions. Which means the messages of symbolism will be wide-ranging and going from the ultra-subtle to that which delivers a swift kick to the shin. Perhaps we tend to think of the symbolic only as that shrouded in mystery, and not as those more obvious examples which also come our way."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Symbols are representations of truths, and it is the responsibil ity of the Elect to Understand those representations and the pure truth be hind them. Not \"understa nd\" but \"Understand\" them by viewing them from one's own State of Being. Symbolism covers a pure truth, not a corrupted form, and I think perhaps only Unders tanding will allow one to accurately See that truth or truths. Keep this in mind, and then go further to where the Key continues on to say: \"Only by Understanding them can they serve us as a language so that we can accurately communicate among ourselves as we continue to evolve. Even more important though is the process that occurs within us as individuals as we work towa rd and discover their hidden meanings.\" This says two important things to me. 1. In order that symbolisms [and the truths behind them] serve as an accurate form of communication, it is imperative they be explored in such a way that one thinks in symbols with Magical ease and 2. to accomplish this, certain Highest and useful Truths must be a part of the Being. In other words, one must Become the truths—and this does not imply losing the individual Awareness of Self. It's not po ssession. I would say it's an obsession in seeking the purity of the Highest States of Being ... wh ich are always ahead of what has been attained up to that point. [A train of thought: the Highest possible State is always going to be a bit further ahead. If striving for that further State br ings about a greater refinement , is there ever going to be a time when the Being will be so pure, so refine d, so High, that it will be impossible for it to make another move? It goes against my Setian grain to foresee such a thing, but I'll hazard a guess. It might be possible if the Being uses it s resources to create for itself a universe so fixed that it becomes the very principle of the Greater Law. Ah, but there's a way out of that trap → becoming a \"Greater Law\" sort of State m eans limits would be imposed by the Self on the Self with an awareness of what was bei ng done. (Translation = an end will come about only if one so Wills it.) No rush on deciding the answer for yourself. You have eternity at your disposal.] Key #4 makes a statement which I feel is deservi ng of twenty-eight point type, but let's settle for italics: 16 \"... we already possess the knowledge of the symbolic.\" Do you see that? You already have the knowledge within you. The knowledge, not the Understanding. The knowledge, the Key goes on to say, \"... is locked deep within and so our task is to bring what is known to consciousness.\" There's the catch. It's going to require effort [a s indicated by the word \"task\"] to bring about an awareness of the universal implications of that knowledge ... which is another way of saying exerting the force of Will is going to bring about a consciousness of XXX . And truly, this is why reaching Understanding seems so much like remembering."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Which comes first—the question or the answer ? In a great number of cases, it seems the answer is around before the question is ever put in a form which the Heart and Intellect together can appreciate. The answers are everywhere—both answers and Answers—and it seems they can be answers only when they have a relevance to the Being and its consciousness and State of Being. Answers? Let us say rather manifestation and Man ifestations. It is then up to each Initiate to notice what has come about and to then explore the \"why\" of it in his or her own unique way. It is this the Key refers to when it says: \"... the symbolism will expand and bring before the mind's eye (inner eye/third eye) a vast complex of abstract, magical, intuitive states of Being with qualitie s, associations, and relationships which while they are experi enced—they can never be truly explained.\" Note this quote says that the quest(s) can be known to exist, can be followed and brought to consciousness, and that if succe ssfully pursued, are experienced and become a part of the Being through being experienced . So—which will be the gr eater—you or the principle experienced? You. You are utilizi ng the Dark Side and maintaini ng that which is You without falling prey to a fixed state. That what is experienced cannot be explained even to another Magici an can be frustrating, tantalizing, and almost humor ous—ever notice how many of us talk with our hands? But it's not a lost cause, since we seem to understand eac h other rather well. Quite seriously, there are no molds in the Temple of Set, and that means no one is going to view and/or experience the same answers in quite the same way. Rememb er—we're Life-oriented, and that means the individuals must be given the maximum space to Be a Self qualified to act in concert. Now, where was I? Ah yes, pontificating. Both Intellect and Heart ar e necessary to Being— just try having one without the other and see what happens. But that applie s to having a stable [not static] Being, not to the Understandi ng which comes about through the Heart. Not without good reason does the Key say the mundane must not interfere with the process of the symbolic entering the consciousness; were it to do so, what one would wind up with would be only parts of truths—which the Intellect woul d force the Being to compromise on, thereby incorporating corruptions and sending one further back from the original starting point. So let the Heart see and absorb and let the Inte llect identify with what Is. Example? \"... every Setian who 'experiences' the Pentagra m needs no further explanation than just seeing the symbol because Its Truth has become a part of them. To anyone who has not, It will ever be a five-pointed upside-down st ar—regardless of explanations offered.\" Let us turn our attention to the Stélé of Xe m. As Key #4 says, the Stélé is composed of symbolism—entirely. It is important to remember that \"No symbol has been used in the Stélé for the sake of art; rather art has been employed for the sake of symbolism.\" As Pyramid-XXII discusses the Stélé of Xem, you'll find it helpfu l to have both Key #4 and the Stélé nearby for reference. The upper portion of the Stélé rests on a ba se formed by the hieroglyphs of the IAM Manuscript and is bound on each side by Maat's plumes, as is Understanding. The plume at the left side of the Stélé has a narrow border, possibly indicative of the fact that the Temple of Set and its mysteries are not ex actly easy to find in the mundane world from which one must initially seek it. Narrow though it is, it still has Maat's plume, which signals the presence of Truth 17 . The narrow left border can also be seen as that entry into th e Order of Set, the point at"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"which one can begin to aspire to the knowledge of Set himS elf. Regardless of personal interpretation, it remains that only through Maat is it that one proceeds ... and the only Maat is that of Being. \"The bases of the two plumes are touching the Set-headed Uas scepters which face each other.\" The scepters, the Key explains, are the \"a uthority of the Word of Set,\" and also are as bound/limited as the Initiate lets them be. The scepters touch the plumes, thereby indicating the authority of the Word is separate but not divided from Maat. The scepters also frame the hieroglyphs of the IAM Manuscript, which says to me that all that can and shall be attained springs from the fiery Gift of Set. But go fu rther in the Key and find the statement that, \"... the scepter on the left issues forth the Word ' Xem ' while the scepter on the right limits the same.\" Bound or unbound? Symbolically it is bound, for Xem is not a final goal but a new beginning. Finite? Only if so chosen. It ca nnot, at this point, be stated exactly what form exists beyond the Xem and its transformational [al Xem ical] powers, though Per-t is a further refinement and is a step closer to Understanding what may be. The Black Jackal is seen as a motionless form wi thin the page. It faces the entrance side of the Stélé and is in a position of alert waiting. As the Key says, \"... the Neter is not yet manifested.\" It manifests [as seen between the pl umes] when it functions as the Opener of the Way, and until that occurs it holds its secret life locked within. It sits surrounded by hieroglyphs, hieroglyphs that st ate even while seemingly moti onless it can in Maat say, \"IAM.\" On the IAM Manuscript itself: there have been references to it here and there in Temple documents, but rarely does one see it as the subjec t of an article or paper. It is complex and can be baffling in the extreme, which is no he lp when one reads it and Knows it holds Truths. It is a document of profound meaning, and one that can hold meaning only to a consciousness which is aware of it in Maat. And ther e is the answer to its hidden aspects → it must be experienced before it can be appreciated. The wording of the IAM Manuscript is precise, as the Key indicates, thereby presenting a challenge in another form: Become precise in your being so that other preci sions can be Understood. There is motion within the Stélé, motion that re fuses and has nothing to do with the funereal bindings of Osiris [the bindings being symbolic of a frozen stasis]. Note the Key says there is a definite motion of the Principles (plural) of the entity. No truly Living entity will be made of a single Principle, though the in dividual task may be to bri ng about a manifestation of a certain one. Set, the Initiate, Anubis, and Xem are shown moving. The Black Jackal, Maat, and Xepera are not shown to be in motion, but observe this: each is shown poised for action, action which the Initiate will set in motion for hi mself. The figures present show the abstract in the plainest way possible for a scribe to show it. That took a lot of work and Work and love to bring about. Think about it. Let's look at the figure of Set within the Stélé. It stands on a base whic h brings him very close to the Initiate. That base itself is symbolic of the Darkness which the mutual Work as brought into perspective. The Initiate has elevated himsel f to the point that he is able to greatly reduce the distance between himself and the Prince of Dar kness. That Prince stands with his left foot and hand foremost [as do Anubis and the Initiate], indicating to the Initiat e that he, Set, is a"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"Creature of Darkness. His balance is such that either foot could be forward, though he must touch the mind of man in a way in which he can be perceived. In this case, it is the symbolic. About his wrists and ankles are black bands w ith narrow white borders. Art? Symbolism. He is Self-ordered, a Creature who cannot abide the light and has esta blished his Darkness, pushing back the light which can only follow nature's laws. You will note the same can hold true of the kilt. The white line extends from th e waist in a diagonal line flowing down to the right knee. The interpretations wi ll be myriad, so I'll offer only one more on the kilt's slanted line. The white crosses the suprapubic and pubic ar eas, and can be seen as a symbol of a Self- ordered State within the Darkness. Entirely satis factory? No, but remember these are my own interpretations [which will be dated as s oon as put on paper] as apply to my own Understanding. Your own will be different. On e further word on the kilt's symbolism and we'll move on. The borders are, again, white. Not only does the lower band show a symmetry, but it can show an established base, brought about through Will. The upper band has lines moving at angles. Those angles are seen to move in the light, bringing about a binding of the light and making it subject to th e Magician. All this Set can do without symbolisms; it is the Initiate for whom it is portrayed through the use of symbols. The spine and skull of the Initia te are the only logical places Se t would be looking at. It's not that he has a thing for bones—what's a stack of vertebrae and a s kull to the Prince of Darkness?—but rather that the skull and spine house the centra l nervous system, that which sends and receives impulses from all other ar eas. This narrows it down, but neither is it correct to say Set has a thing fo r masses of tissue. What he is concerned with is what originates from those physical structures. Withi n, in what is made from those impulses and their usages, is that which is you . And that is what holds Set's intere st. [He has also invested a lot of time and effort into those who are his own. One could hardly expect indifference on his part after that.] Having touched on Set's appearance in the Stélé, le t's examine the Initiate. He stands with his left foot forward, following Set's symbol of the Le ft Hand Path as shown in the Stélé. His kilt is white with proportional black curved lines indicating, as the Key says, \"... the realm in which his semblance must exist....\" Note here th at those lines curve. Do they curve up or down? Well, is a glass of water half filled or half emptied? The answer depends on your own insights and initiative to know. There is a section of the kilt which extends down from the phallic area—the Initiat e has a firm basis of Creation a nd the lines are horizontal and suggestive, in shape, of the H eart further over in Maat's scales . To me this indicates Creation from the Heart. And this is get ting deep, so let me put in some thing you need to bear in mind: a disclaimer. These views, now, are my own, and are not to be taken as the final word. It's very important that you us e what I'm writing in a way that will make you question rather than saying, \"Oh, he's a Magister, so that's the way it is.\" O.K.? Back to the Initiate! The black waist band is the Initiate's umbilical , and is stated as such in the Key. Ah, but where does it attach? Not to Set and not to Anubis. Look closely at the figure. Magus Barrett points out the lin e the Initiate is standing on ... which should make you look at the rest of the \"flooring\" presen t. The Initiate and Anubis alone stand at that level, the other figures being more or less elevated. Set is clos er through his own choice. Maat is higher; she is a Principle and the Initiate must rise to her level of his own free Will and through his own efforts. Maat, on the other hand, cannot descend to a lower level. Truth cannot compromise. The figure of Xem is on the highest level. He has passe d Maat's Pylon, Become, and stands as a symbol of the naos of the Temple he Is."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"The nemes which covers the skull and upper verteb rae of the Initiate is dark. It, the nemes , shows a gate of dual function: the darkness which covers it must become the Darkness, or realm, of his own controlling; it also serves as a gate which will admit only that capable of traveling through the Darkness. The phi quality is present. The Serpent One is poised on the pineal gland, and not simply as a nice place to rest. She separates but does not divide. If the Stélé of Xem were to be in full colour, what colour would the disk on the Initiate's heart be? I suggest it would change fr om moment to moment, varyi ng both in colour and hue. The fact that the Pentagram hovers above and before the Initiate shows, as in the Key, \"... his freedom and the conditions of his part.\" It is also a subtle reference to perspective. [\"... I shall see with his eyes.\"] Another poi nt Key #4 brings out is this: \"He must conquer all fear of th e Unknown and the ever changing.\" In other words, when the temptation to use the Pe ntagram as a security bl anket arises, it must be put down [the temptation, not the Pentagram] . The Pentagram is a symbol, not a machine gun. The Magic you do comes from you. The Pentagram is the great symbol. 18 The Initiate holds the Neter symbol in his ri ght hand. The flag shape points toward Maat's Pylon and to the dir ection he aspires. [ Xem 's Neter symbol is not held. It has Become a firm part of his Name and now is in a position in which the flag portion shows achievement.] Why hold the Neter symbol in the right hand? Be yond the fact that Anubis has the left hand occupied, there's a valid Magical and symbolic reason. The Initiate has cer tain conditions and responsibilities in being Elect, one of which is that he must contribute to the Functioning of the Temple of Set. He can do this only by Becoming a God, which he will not do without receiving and giving input from other Elect. He remains totally Alone—separate but not divided. Key #4 states this by saying, \"His Work is his effort in his personal Setamorphosis and is unique unto himself. The result of his Wo rk, however, may serve all of the Elect and in that respect becomes Functional.\" [To make this clear, go back to Key # 3. In that, \"Function\" is defined as each individual Principle Working in concert with the other Principles toward the Great Work. \"Function occurs within the collective effort toward the collective evolution....\" \"Pri nciple\" is the highest form of Truth. \"... Work is the individual effort toward individual evol ution.\" Principle plus Function will equal Neter, which is a Working Fo rm of a Purpose. Keep these in mind and the messages of the Keys will be far clearer.] Look now to the Initiate's left hand, the symbol of his (individual) Working aspect. He Works toward Manifesting Xem through Xeper ir Xem a Per-t , and to do this, he locates that Function which is there to assist him—the Opener of the Way. \"The left hand of Anubis 19 is grasping the right hand of Anubis...,\" or, the Initiate, in his Work, utilizes the Function of Anubis—which means the latter is Functioning to bring about others who can increase the Functioning of the Temple. There are distinct messages in the Stélé s howing both forms of Anubis. On a somewhat superficial level, one must see the mundane befo re the esoteric can be appreciated. The Black Jackal is not the common jackal of Egypt. Canis lupister could be considered as a symbol of finite man, going about life obeying the impulse s generated by nature; the Black Jackal, on the other hand, symbolizes that which moves not in accord with nature but against its laws. \"... [common jackals] prefer carri on (which is a clue to the prin ciple of Anubis).\" Now, since"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"the jackal can be symbolic, where does that put you? By virtue of being Setian, aren't we all more or less \"dead\" to the worl d of finite man? You're not? Th en try going out and associating with humanity on humanity's level, disregarding a ll you've attained and all that is Maat. If you're able to do this with no awareness of the acute differences in yourself and John Q. Nerd, then I submit that you are actively suppressing what you Are → an Alien to mankind. 20 Magus Barrett approaches the Black Jackal symbol in a more direct way and leaves space for each reader to explore the symbol as deeply as he or she desires. As he points out, the symbol must fit the Neter; the Neter does not compromi se itself to fit the symbol, which would be a rather limiting procedure. Keep in mind that a discussion of the Black Jackal is also a discussion of al Xem y in that the Black Jackal is a symbol bringing about life through transformation. The emph asis on the hieroglyph sab puts more light on the \"life through transformation\" aspect [as in the Symbol and the Symbolic quote which specifies a \"separating out of the elements capable of transformation and future evolution\" as a leading function of the jackal]. Having this in mind, Key #4 then presents a subt le invitation to look in the mirror by stating that each Elect Setian has his/her own pantheon in the microcosmic. It's there—you only have to look. Perhaps this is a detail in the \"why\" of the fact that as tremendous and unique as our Beings are, we can still understand and Understa nd one another. [But not to the point of \"We are one; we are none!\"] Now give some hard t hought to this: within you is an Anubis. I am content to let that particul ar timebomb tick away in you. You'll note Maat's Pylon is situated in such a way that there is no way over, under, or around it. It can either be passed th rough or turned back from. Period. The Maat within the Trapezoid is the Truth of the Self seeking Xem , and it determines whether evolution or mutation will take place, though the choice is up to the Initiate, the Maat showing what Is to the Self. If the microcosmic Maat reflects the macrocosmic Maat , the Initiate gains a new perspective. He Understands his Truth to be pure, innocent, and High, and has seen his Self against the background of the conditions he knows to be vital to Life. If the Feather balances the Scales, he has met those conditions. If he has met the conditions, the AnX is offered to him; otherwise the symbol of Life stays put, and the Initiate may return to Osiris. Having grasped the AnX, the Initiat e is now in a universe of un ique perception. He is of the Order of Xepera and has Realized his Self, Understanding his Work and Function. No Guide holds his hand, for he now comprehends the Guid e and the Path in a way he could not have done prior to this Ordeal. He now faces the Task of Creation. The Task of Creation will ensure even more firmly that an end co mes about only through so Willing it, for the Shen reflects the infinity of Neter Xem whose Name is Unknown . Or, just as what he has Realized is far beyond his former dreams, so what he will build is far beyond what he can now foresee. He may know his Name at the present moment, but he cannot foresee all he will Become through using the powers of that Name. What he does will impact in myriad directions and cause change, ther eby always creating a nd being created through Creation. In the Stélé, Xem is Faceless. This must be as it is b ecause the Initiate knows he will create, but he does not know all he will Man ifest. After passing Maat's Pylon, he has a far clearer picture than before encountering the challenging Truth. Does this mean the IV°+ see features on the Faceless One? I invite you to Wo rk and Realize your Self and see."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Xem has the complete symbols of his godhood: th e beard, the AnX, the crown of the Naos surrounded by Truth, evenly balanced light/dark in his bands and clothing symbols, and the sealed scroll. Please place your copies of Key #4 and the Stélé of Xem side by side and read on to the end of the Key while paying close atten tion to the Stélé. After that, a reading of the Statement of Leviathan in the Diabolicon will furt her clarify that which is Xem —the Self ahead of the Self. Key #5 Key #5 changes the view, moving from the micr ocosmic to the macrocosmic in order to broaden the quest. It was and is necessary to examine the role of the individual Initiate before going to the Task(s) of the Temples themselv es. Key #5 emphasizes concert, that which cannot be brought about without each participant learning constantly of himself. Our impressions of reality are constantly changing due to our own constant changes. As Magus Barrett says in the Key, \"... reality is mostly perceptual and ... when the individual reality is combined with the perceptual realities of other Elect individuals, some rather complicated situations and circum stances begin to occur.\" Note now , that \"... reality is mostly perceptual...,\" and remember that the Realm of Xem will be what it is made to be. That is, that Created will be reality, reality made as in tense as each Initiate/th e Initiates make it. One starts with the realization, which Priest Moffatt put into words at the November 11, XV, Order of Set meeting 21 ; I quote from Order of Set-89 22 : \"... Xem is individual as each Setian is individu al—yet we remain Brothers and Sisters by comprising parallel universes. The highlight of his statement for me was, 'I am all— I am the meaning of life!'\" Read the last very carefully: \"I am all— I am the meaning of life!\" Those words hold a Truth which activates all the facets of the Being and enable it to Xeper to Xem through the Manifestation of what Is ... and is another beginning. You. You are the reality, and you , both singular and collective, determine the real. \"Higher man must conquer fear.\" Conquer . Not ignore, not skir t, not suppress, but conquer fear. Look on fear objectively, and it is seen as neither good nor evil in itself, but rather an emotion ... which means the effect of fear on th e Initiate can become a thing of positive or negative values depending on the response of the Initiate. If it brings about a hesitation or compromise, the result is evil. If faced and overcome, it is beneficial. Your eyes have been opened by the Gift of Set and your Initiatio n; now you are gods and can know good and evil. Also sprach Apep! Yet, actually conquering fear is n't as easy as knowing it necessary. Fear takes many forms, ranging from mundane fears to th at of the blazing thing which is the Self itself. The fear spoken of isn't that healt hy self-preservation factor 23 ; it is the fear of the unknown, that lurking thing which, while not alive, can itself ca use death. It is also th e fear of the knowledge of the ultimate freedom of Xeper and the awareness of being Alone with no omnipotent God to inflexibly govern and record each step and acti on. It is the fear from the realization that you are all and that you are the meaning of Life. It is not a thing to be taken lightly."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"Where lies the fault when changes are realized and some Magicians ar e lost? Obviously, the problem is in the Magician and not in the cha nge itself—otherwise, there would be no one left by now. Indeed, it's ironic that someone could Work and work to encourage the progress of the Æon, and then fall when the very thing work ed toward comes about. I can think of more than one Magician greatly loved and respected who lost all by refusing to Understand, thereby embracing the stillness which is Osiris. It's sad that such things happen, but Set never promised us the Elysian fields, and in addi tion to being realists, we are also elite. The Way of Xeper ir Xem a Per-t is change, the change br ought about through Initiation. [Remember, change comes about in two form s: evolution and mutation. If the Being is working toward the purity of Xem , evolution occurs. If flaws are ignored the result is mutation ... and perhaps this is part of the answ er to why we see Magici ans crash—the eyes of the Self are opened and what Is is seen.] Consider this from Key #5: \"... it is easy to see why the Magical Formula of the Æon can be disturbi ng or even terrifying to anyone except the most zealous and adventurous.\" There it is → the Magical Formula states each Initiate has the perfect freedom to change and thereby must take the full responsibility for what he or she Becomes. It can be rather frightening, would you not say? The act of accomplishing change through Will and leading to e volution is the definition of Magic. Not, now, White Magic, bu t Black Magic, that which lead s to a distinct Self-ordered state of Being Apart. It is a tr iumph over the Greater Law and is the key to Living. It is also a triumph which can end only at the Initiate's c hoice for the Gate of Change has been opened through the Word Xem . Any closing of the Gates can be done only on either an individual, microcosmic level or on a macrocosmic leve l through the fading of the Majesty of Set. The opening of those Gates does not imply it to be the time to relax. On the contrary, the Uttering of Xem impacted on all things, as Words do, and thereby added momentum to the coming annihilation. Change must come about. Period. And the fastest way to court disaster is to refuse to change and work with cha nge; there are enough examples of that in the mundane world, let alone in our own ex-members. Yet the annihilation is going to prove beneficial because it's going to present the Initiate with a choice of \"Do or die.\" The Elect Magician will respond by doing ... and in doing/changing/evolving, Xem will be reborn. Read closely the paragraph beginning \"Going back to annihilation statement....\" It is clearly written, and asks no furthe r comment at this time. A Word can come crashing down about the ears of its followers only if the Word becomes so fixed that it cannot be to uched or further refined → which can happen only within the Initiate's Self. It is for this reason that we see Thelemites, etc., clinging to the old outdated ways and wrapping themselves in Osiris' bindings . The truth of the matter about Words is that a Word serves its hearers, not the other way around.

Commentary and Analysis of Anubis' Keys Classification: V4 - A17.26 - 3 Author: Robertt W.

As each of the High Priest's Keys were digested by Magistra Thomas, they cons equently were forwarded to her Pyramid A assignments and the Order of Set with her own perceptions included. At the time that I received her comments on the first Key, I was doing a lot of letter writing (communication), but was not involved, per se , in any substantial project. I had read the Keys and other parts of the Onyx Tablet , but I had not really made an in depth study of the implications/Truths of the Keys. With her encouragement and remarks (designed to get us Working), I set myself to the task of analyzing that firs t Key with an attitude of sinc erity and force. Well, after commenting upon the first Key, committing myself to work ing on the second Key was easier, and so it went. Although much of my speculations are that of a relatively new Priest, I hope that you will find enlightenment therein. I realize that much of what I perceived during the period covered while I was Working on Keys 1 to 4 indicates an intellectual B slant or approach. To that I state that while I intend to hang on to any ability to intellectualize, I am also working on freeing myself so th at I may learn more using the intelligence of the Heart. In retyping my comments on the Keys fo r possible inclusion in the Onyx Tablet , I could not help but notice how my opinions had in some ways changed on certain issues, and how I have since come to know other facts and Truths pertaining to Xem and Initiation. However, I chose not to alter the comments as I had them recorded at the respective times/dates that they were originally wr itten. Had I redone my comments here, they would not reflect that earlier stage of my Initiation and understanding. B So I ask that you please bear with inaccuracies contained in some of my statements and my bold speculation in others. It is with the greatest affection and reverence that I th ank Anubis for Opening the Way for me personally. If the distance that I have traveled thus far ca n be measured in years, then count the distance I have yet to travel in light years. As much as initiation is a task for the individual Elect, the aid and guidance that is made available to the Black Magician is indispensable. Anubis has complimented my aspirations. On the pathway to Xeper ir Xem, I shall seek out and support him in his guidance. Not as if he were this or that, but because he IS. Xeper ir Xem, Priest Neilly March 6th, XVI A.S. Key #1 - Comments and Analysis The minds and Hearts of the Priesthood, as Bl ack Magicians comprising the Temple of Set, shall do the Work of actualizing Xem, together, but in relation to each other's Selves. The end of the world need not be taken literally, but may be so at so me point in the future. For I consider your statement, Magistra Thomas: \"It scares me to death b ecause it means the end of the world as I know it....\" to mean to all the aspirants who me et the challenge of Initiation into Xem D , that we must say good-bye to all of our st andard human reactions and deficiencies in order that our beginni ng without end may be activated. So many things that we have been relying upon, such as emotions, fatigue, and ev en sickness, must be put in their places."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"That is, of course, easier said that done, and (for now anyway) we still have to consider problems caused by our having to physically conti nue and function at our jobs, and/or in day- to-day society. Until such a time as we can sh ed the ugly responsibilities of living in a physical body, in a physical world (as well as not doing that), we must be conscious of reactions to our changes that are detected by humans. For those humans sometimes exercise control of various aspects affecting our co existence with them. A certain amount of conformity in respect to society is still necessary for now. And speaking of Maat-based realistic terms, there can be no turning back onc e we have begun. The very thought of that is a contradiction to initiation into actualizing Xem. There are so, so many \"items\" that we must be on t op of in order to afford us, as Initiates, the opportunity of Xepering toward Xem - Human w eaknesses, and a multitude of them. Most of the Elect probably have a few of these weakne sses, so chosen from the bounty that has been made available through the auspices of manki nd's brain. Some of my personal ones, my Sister, are as follows: the attract ion to cosmetic forms of indulgence such as T.V. (not that much, however); social events like card parties and downtown 'f un.' I am afraid of various things/situations, like astral travel (perhaps it is not always significant, anyway); unfamiliar situations where I don't know what to do; f ears of not understanding something as it was meant to be and not being able to explain it to others (my I° and II°'s, for instance); and fears about not working hard enough and with my Setia n sense, that may lead me to missing out on a chance I should be taking. And hosts of other impurities that will take some weeding out. I am sometimes afraid, by not knowing just how hard or how far my Will will push its vehicle (my body) before it temporarily breaks down. I sometimes dwell on that, because I know I could not accomplish such things as administ rative work if my body wo uld not or could not function. Of course, I have yet to push my body to its limit. But, by doing so, would I risk being out of commission? The an swer to that may be in searching out my Will. I don't know. E In your letter concerning Key #1, you state: \"... feel many of the sa me things I do, even though they may not advertise them as I appear to\" (my underscore). I feel that the examples you provide to us are illustrative a nd therefore not just a case of advertising them. We can gain from such examples, as you have. By not advert ising these things, I be lieve that I am not verbalizing them for what they are. When you \"write and write,\" are you doing so from your Form and as an Ancient One? I speculate here, but I feel that some of our Neters F may be a part of the \"Ancient Ones,\" a nd thus far not all of the Ancien t Ones essential to us have surfaced and initiated action yet. Is actualizing Xem, in part , activation of the Ancient One inside of me? By rooting out the weaknesses spok en of earlier, I think we can effectively learn not to incorporate a ny further weaknesses. In response to: The aspirant must be conscious of that whic h he is and is not; which he knows and knows not; which he does and does not; which he Wills and Wills not; which is M aat and is not Maat. The aspirant can be conscious of all this, but he must work for it. I sum this up in the meaning of the simple wo rd \"awareness.\" We must always apply our Selves towards constant awareness. Inner eyes, inner ears and inner senses must all be able to function and perceive things. We must know what we actually are and what we are not (though we may have already said or thought we were other thi ngs in the past); we must recognize and admit to ourselves just what we actually know (and stop claiming we know more than we do); we must recognize just wh at we have done and not claim that we have done something which we have not; we must know, by the effects of the causes, what we have"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Willed, as we cannot afford to be surprised by something that has come about from our Willing it so in the first place; and we must strive to be conscious of the real things that represent Maat and of those that are false. Of course, I simply restate here that which has already been said. Others who interpret are doing the same, but with different phrases and words. The forms of death you mention for one to bring hi m or herself close to before the Setian can sense his or her beginning without end do not by necessity have to include physical death. There is death of our human weaknesses; death of non-important \"facts\"; death of our present state, and death of our deficiencies, among the many. G I feel when you state, \"... the only real consistency is that I am Living ..., \" with a capital \"L,\" that in spite of, and in defiance of, lingerings of past illne ss, my Sister, you Live. But, are a ll of the odds against us? Sometimes I may not recognize an \"odd\" that is against me. If I do not see it (the odd) as being against me, then have I not pushed and overcome it? Or have I shoved it into the background and just ignored it? By overcoming the odds, we can Become and maintain new levels of Being wh ile aspiring ever higher (my rephrasing of the Key). When we reach a new level of Being, we cannot then forget it, but rather, we must incorporate it and contin ue onward. From Key #1: There can be no answer to anything unless firs t there is a question ... Only an answer can make a question possible therefore every questio n contains its own answer ... The Keys will not teach, nor can Xem be taught. I think that Xem must exist (the answer) to our quest (the question). We concentrate our entire Will and become Self-conscious and activate ou r own question, which allows us to discover Xem, which already exists or begins to exist for us as we discover it. \"Xem and the levels of Being are ever unknown until attained.\" We stand before Maat and weigh our Heart against her Truths. Is it at that point that we find out just how our weaknesses are being manifested? Does every Pr iest or Priestess find the same sort of things out about themselves at that time? My feelings concerning Initiations' beginnings are still unclear in some ways. To sp eculate, I will say that I think when we weigh our Heart against Maat and disc over (face to face) our state of Being, we learn that which we had thought our Being was - only touching the surface. The Neter that we manifest has a face H that we did not know. And the Neter's positi on in regard to Xem and Xeper may be just as shocking. I will speak more about that of the Initiate's beginning when I summarize Key #2 and the method of Initiation. To begin learning with the inte lligence of the heart, it is ne cessary to change the mental outlook and the normal way of thinking. The heart is certainly not a muscle or organ. Rath er, the Heart can be an attitude. It is a Way. The Heart and Maat should be attached to th e same point. The Heart is capable of real (in)sight. Significance is the aspect of the Heart's attributes. Revealing: \"... the secrets of Khem's origin, Xem\" , is to see just what did precede what. Also, I feel it is to know what thing will postdate an other. I think that Xem is the only actuality because it is origin, past and fu ture. In Xem might be such th ings self-contained as Khem, mankind and the very cosmos. Should the as pirant, questing toward Xem, study books on"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"ancient Khem or is the reference to Khem m eant for Us to remember just where We, the Initiates, originate from? And the dictionary does no justice to the meaning of \"metaphysics\" when it states it is: \"The science of abstract principles\" (and essential principles). Are these principles, in effect, Our manife stations of ancient Neters? If so, then we must look ever harder inside our Selves to see through and beyond: \"... Egyptology and the popular sciences....\" For in that case, we would constitute all that is written on Khem. I feel that studies of certain books (Budge, etc.) may provide some clues and compliment our Beings (that are hidden in the books). Perhaps I do not properly understand the term \"metaphysics.\" I think that we must, to reiterate, activate our individual anci ent Beings so that we have (re)formed the Principle/Vehicle in which we can realize Xem through Maat. Granted I may come to know my Self a nd Become the Initiate who is ready to: \"... take the step that separates but does not divide;\" I then will know what that statement means? I do not yet know or remember, and maybe that is because: \"Xem and the levels of Being are ever unknown until attained.\" Maybe I will separate myself from the human race, but not divide myself from my Brothers and Sisters, the Anci ent Ones. I think I may at least be partially right. If I don't know yet, I think it's coming to me! Key #2 - Comments and Analysis The order and orders that Xem has/will ha ve must rest with and on those already initiated/being initiated into Xem. Xem may al ready have an order (structure) and orders (elements) because there are those who have actualized Xem. I I speculate that the IV° has done so, but it is not necessary to be a IV° Ma ster to do so. Timing. The order and orders may be enhanced/changed as more Initiates begin ac tualizing Xem. The abstraction that is Xem requires Initiation into it, in or der that the Initiate becomes th at abstraction and is able to manifest it and transform it. That is part of the fear. \"Higher Man must conquer fear....\" begins with the Elect of Set aspiring to initiation, who can conquer the fear that will be experienced when that In itiate sees his Self. When you speak of and emphasize the word \"human,\" it speaks to me of how a human is a three-dimensional being, who talks out of his hat and is programmed. By being a human, many things must pass unknown and undetected a nd right before the eyes. And yet, humans (and that of Us that is human) manage to usua lly have something seemingly a uthoritative to say about most things. You stress the need to question, as the Magus has done, and referred to the: \"... first challenge of the Xem Working....\" We must Will this confronting of our Selves and conquer that fear that accompanies, experiencing this: \"... Self balanced against Maat....\" In this Ordeal of Initiation, J the Initiate, after the experien ce, may choose (Willfully) not to go through his or her: \"... constructive transformation ...,\" and in that uneventful choice lies danger. There is danger of \"wigging-out\"; da nger of having to put out the Black Flame (returning to the mundane) and pr obably the danger in remember ing the Ordeal and having to live with that ... inactive. It is greatly significant th at We know who We are. \"The aspirant must be conscious of that which he is and is not....\" We must know t hat until we ove rcome the fear and go through the Initiation which: \"... is an ordeal of change,\" we are still going to be man, the lower animal, and not Higher Man. You say that as having re cognized an exoteric key, you had exercised the \"Understanding of Higher Man.\" It happened when you did not react in your former pre-"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Xem nature in regard to the boss' girlfriend. Th is is like (among other things) not \"playing the game,\" as is outlined in Transactional An alysis, and it ties in with not employing: \"... human standards which are but games, petty religion and politics.\" But in addition to that, the move you made appears to me to be one of logic. If that premise is correct, then is not logic the Essential Principle that is encompassed within Higher Man? K It could be that I do not understand the significance of that: \"external or mundane key.\" A nd it could just be that I do not know why it was logical. In dealing with similar situations, I have so metimes taken a similar reaction to yours. But I had thought my attitude to be one that was \"calle d for\" or \"natural\" or even \"diplomatic.\" Are all of those reasons emblematic of Higher Man? If I look inside and call upon my Self/Neter to be judged and revealed, will that lead to the realization of the exoteric keys and, consequently, to esoteric keys? It could be that when I take the great challenge of Initiation, my q uestions may at once seem redundant and answered. In the past, I did not know of the term Higher Man, and, therefore, I could not ha ve made any conscious reference to it. But knowing it now and seeing your descriptive illu stration and Magus Barrett's Xem Working ... I do not know if what I consider to be logical in any instance is also that which is Higher Man. From Key #2: Aspiration or good intentions are insufficient to Xeper. Xeper is never a relaxed Will and only Xeper can transform Being. To try and point toward my interpretation of the above, I quote from the Xem Working: “In listening to him, I understood on his level that Xeper is never a relaxed Will - but rather a determination to BE. Even ac tivity in the mundane world must be conscious Will and with creative purpose. The only 'truth' is that of Being !“ I now begin to know and understand and see the actualitie s and reality, rather than just seeing slightly below the surface. I can recognize some of what you have been saying about Being all of the time, and: \"in all that you do \" (your quote). That does not mean physically doing projects, writing letters, read ing, etc., in all of the time you have from the mundane ... it means to Be and Being L . The rough translation - immerse yourSe lf in what you are, so that what you are isn't solely made up of characteristics, personali ty, or habits. Allow the core Being to emerge. In doing so, you will BE. The act or process of BEING is a conscious one. Earlier on, I spoke about \"BEING Xem.\" In effect , this meant that your full Being is involved in the substance of Xem; ie., you are Xem. in all th at you do, no matter what it is you are doing at any particular time. Again, from the Xem Working: \"Even activity in the mundane wo rld must be conscious Will and with creative purpose.\" From this statement and others like it, ideas begin to hit home base with me. \"... but those who sink in to it are imprisoned and Being is abandoned for purposelessness.\" I am glad that I restudied the Xem Working in conjunction with the Keys and your letters. It is easier for me to not be defensive and assure you that when I indulge in such past-times as social events, T.V., or wh atever (some of those being diversions), I do know what I am doing and, in that, I hope I am one of: \"Those who Will to participate in the lower world are conscious of that which they do and Are....\""},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"I am a Priest of Set, and although I may have co me across as portraying just working at being a Priest in my spare time ... then I, too, have been misunderstood. I do \"d uties\" in my reserve time (after work, on weekends, etc.), such as physically writing letters , reading, etc.; however, I am a Priest of Set before and above all else. As you state in your comments on Key #2: \"That which is your core should be preimmi nent in all that you do, feel, and say.\" I could also add to that, that I f unction (or at least try to be awar e) as a Priest, from a Priest ... that which I am. It is a question now of being aware more of the time and in more instances. But, this letter is not an essay on what I e xpect I should know and f eel. I am learning though, and I admit the difficulties I encounter Becoming accustomed. And when you state the work THINK (in capitals), by nature it speaks of Work. I must Work, even if the truth hurts. No, I cannot always bring myself to do that which constitutes Thinking . And those \"necessary\" lies will come about when necessary. But I strive to remain as conscious as possible in my actions. The reason that I sometimes lack that which is consciousness is due to laziness and fear, among others. The basis of Initiation into Xem dictat es that the aspirant conquer fear. M When you state: \"It is essential in Xem that you overcome fear,\" two words are undersco red. Essential is what Xem is all about. Essential and abstract principles. And the ma nifestation and transformation of those Abstract Principles by the Initiate into Xem. I am going through a situation now where I am ev aluating the constituti on that is known as: \"The call to Initiation....\" I think of other \"calls\" that I have had, such as to write a letter to the Order on ways the Temple of Set can make its elf known to potential-Elect. Even the call to the Priesthood. And in attempting to recognize and differentiate the call to Initiation and another call, I feel appr ehensive about this: An important part of Initiation is the call to th e Neter with which the su ccessful Initiate will Work.... Does this \"calling\" to my Neter precede my heeding to the call to Initiation? (Assuming I am unsure of my Neter.) It is very important for me to know clearly the proc ess that will lead me to confronting my Self and going through the Ordeal of Initiation. As you probably know (and I can't remember for su re if I told you or not), I recently \"saw\" myself, or maybe my Self in an image, in a mirror. It took place afte r I had been Willing the idea of me discovering (remembering) the Ne ter that I was. I had searched books and searched myself and the qualitie s that I express. I got impetus from Amon and Bast, and one night the image of the Sphinx and its corres ponding god, Harmachis, hit me. I then studied aspects of Harmachis and Ra. Today, I feel fairly comfortable with this, but not totally. So, I have again been concentrating on the Nature of my Neter (Am on hinted for me to question, and it feels right to do so). I am not certain that Harmachis is \"j ust right,\" and, because I am not certain, I feel that I have not discovered or remembered N my Neter. Try sampling your favourite collection of literat ure and mythology; be it Gree k, Egyptian, Nordic, whatever. Seek, within yourself, imagery that you have always been attracted to or always used (yes, it can be that obvious). Examine creatures, both my thical and real, for their powers and abilities and determine if you feel such things are part of your genui ne makeup. Further, determine through Work and introspection th e nature of the inner Self. Of ten, it's this which provides clues when nothing else will."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Again, these techniques may not work at all for you. The reasons could be numerous, or it simply could be that it's not appropriate or timely for you to be pursuing Neter Work. Finally, look for new search methodologies. All things , even techniques, undergo the process of Xeper. my Neter. I do feel that when my call to my Neter is Truly an swered, there will be no doubts. Certainty. If I am correct about my feelings, then must I (continue) to call upon my Neter before I direct all my \"Powers of Darkness inward to open the gates of Self?\" Should recognizing my Neter then precede my h eeding the call (the call that can not be mistaken) of Initiation? Perh aps by voicing these questions to you, answers will come from me. From Key #2: The Order of Anubis will provide facilities at Xemset for those wi shing to go through a planned ordeal.... Will these facilities be made up of actual objects/devices, written words, places, processes and states of mind and be performed on Xemset (the mountain)? Are the Initiation facilities always there or does the aspirant to Xem notify the High Priest that he or she wishes to go through the planned ordeal ... and then set a mutually convenient date? You see that I am not sure what \"facilities\" means, O and I don't know if I prefer to go it alone, because I don't have ready access to Xemset in order to judge. Can this be done during Set-II? 3 Set-II will probably be my only (limited) foreseeable trip to California in the near future. I feel I shall likely \"go it alone\" when the time is . When the Magus states: \"During the Initiation, which may take one evening or one year...,\" does he refer to the duration of the Initiation or does he refer to the amount of time that may transpire before the aspirant goes thr ough the ordeal? The actual ordeal, when: \"... the Being calls upon its Self to reveal itself to its Self,\" seems both terrifying and a must. How else can I know what Is and what must be . In order that I do Xeper to Xe per's fullest extent, I must Will the experience to happen. It sounds like some thing out of a science fiction/fantasy story (human description). Yet, it is something I feel more and more 'agitated' about. It must contain the basis of everything. It must be the Nameless pursuit that I have so viciously sought out all of my awakened life. It must be the answer. The question remains forming inside me. Yes, I do need rest sometime, but of Xem ... it must be that which supersed es rest and everything else. I do not put the Initiation off, but for some reason I know that all the extra correspondence I have been doing, the projects, my move to a new apartment this weekend and even my attitude ... all of that seems to be like preparations/cleari ngs of the way for my initiation. Is the \"... Being that was not\" totally different from my presen t state? I speculate that it is nearly so. I cannot put my finge r on it, but is that new Being not nearly so human (in its thinking, and not appearance)? Can the new Being do any othe r thing but the Work? These are questions being brought about by changes wi thin me, and are not necessarily meant to be answered to me ... in my present state. \"... the beginning of the actual quest for the Unknown and Nameless One,\" to me, cannot take place without be ing preceded by Initiation into Xem. If it were possible for a non-In itiate to begin the quest ... disaster would result. The challenge in the statement of Leviathan is to complete the destructio n of what is, for We as the Elect cannot complete if We are not assured that We have reached the end of what is ..."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"for the new beginning without end to come about . That end brings the beginning in the new Age (Aeon, World) where those in Xem create and functionalize their own world. At that point, all that have actu alized Xem will be parts and the Whole. Ordered in and of themselves. 4 Satan (Set) in its true glory shall be fr ee from all the bonds to exercise its Will, because Set will have been transformed (the Es sence that Set gives to Us now is the transforming taking place). Set will BE, in final form, Us. The philosopher's stone is Us (who actualize Xem). In BEING US, the philos opher's stone is Set ... transformed. Or I could be way off track! Key #3 - Comments and Analysis As an initial general comment, specifically aime d at true understanding of Words, I have had to rethink just what is behind the words as they are spoken by Anubis in relation to Set and Setians and Xem. Words such as functi on, knowledge, and principle can be taken lightly , or I can try to understand them as the Symbols behind the Abstractions that they really Are. In doing that, I believe that the intel ligence therein comes from the Heart, P and I see new meanings, Higher meanings, in Function, Knowledge, and Principle. In my recent contemplations on the Keys, I found myself at odds with my Self, in that I read the Words and went to the handy dictionary to find the meani ngs and then argued with myself over intellect and Heart. I feel that I am m eeting the challenge, whether it be expressed as learning the new meanings (Key #1) or unlearning the conventional meanings. When viewed as a Magical complex, the Aeon of Set seems easier to see than Xem. Not unlike what constitutes a galaxy or universe. And so it is Becoming its own Universe, with each individual (microcosmic) Elect forming their own universes while we Function as the macrocosmic Temple of Set; althoug h I confess that it is still a bit abstract (pun intended) to see the Aeon as a complex. That is only because my conventional intellect demands a conventional meaning be put on to the word \"complex.\" I try to exercise Higher Understanding and not compare Magical comple x to, say, medical complex. Am I opening the gates of Self by trying to divorce myself from learned response? The T_S_ is already the manifestation of the abstraction that is the Temple of Set. Providing that this statement is correct, at leas t in idea, then we, as the Elect, are attempting to manifest the abstraction Q that is Xem, and then transform it. I am struggling to get my ideas out at this point. To try to carry this a bit further (and I r ealize I include the essence of Key #2, as well as Key #3) to Xem, once it is actualized by the Elec t ... the Elect will then be the manifestation of the Abstraction of Xem, in a similar fashion that the T_S_ is alrea dy the manifestation of the Temple of Set (the Elect, collectively). Does this at all relate to the statement in Key #1: \"Xem and the levels of Being are ever unknown until attained?\" Can a particular level of Being pertain to the Temple of Set collec tively? Maybe I have just blown a fuse! By nature of the Office R of the Executive Director, is not th e Priest or Priestess holding such Office prone to be somewhat stifled in their own personal Xepering? Si nce the E.D. relieves, in operation, the High Priest and/or the Council of Nine of administrata, this would seem to indicate one of two things. Eith er the Priest/Priestess who is E.D. must Xeper ir Xem at a slower rate, or that this Priest/Priestess must be a very exceptional Setian in the first place to enable him/her to carry out the office of E. D. and Xeper ir Xem at their full potential."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"When I think of the Temple of Set, the Order of Set, 5 and myself as one of the Elect, I think of the model of a complex atom. It has a central core (Exalted Man?) and several types and numbers of molecules. To redesign it to fit into the Aeon of Set and the Temple of Set, in particular, I would have the core being the Ac tive and have the types of molecules being the various degrees of initiation by ti tle (III°, IV°, and V°'s), and the numbers of molecules would be the number of III°+ Initiates. In my model, each individual would also be microcosmic, and the whole would be macrocosmic (as in Ke y #3), with perhaps the exception of the core, who I would like to believe is \"... the highest form of Xe per(a) in the Two Lands.\" I feel right about the principle of my model, but am I \"r ight\" about the placement of the Ipsissimus? Although something of this is in Key #4, I beli eve I can see more of the dual aspects of Anubis. High Priest as the \"head\" of the corporation and High Priest as: \"... the Functional head of the Temple of Set in its metaphysical reality.\" By Being Functional, Anubis is performing the actions of his purpose. I would like to write to you concerning the Council of Nine in a separate letter, so I shall be brief at this point. Using hu man words, is the Council of Nine like the complimentary sounding board to the High Priest, fo r the balance of the Temple of Set? It appears to me as if the C_9 are High Priest when he turns his attentions inwards to an swer his own questions, so that he knows what he administers is in Maat. I think I understand why the Orde r of Set is the Inner Temple, S but I do not entirely comprehend the term \"Naos.\" I came across this term while reading The Temple in Man . Does/is the concept Naos (hence Xem) refer to that which is our \"brain\" and which is where we are attempting to \"go\" by actualizing Xem? Principle? By continuing to Xeper ir Xem, do the Elect tr avel that which separa tes but does not divide? What I am trying to state is that while we Live and strive to Be, are we the Functions behind the knowledge of the Two Lands? T If we, as the Elect of Set, are \"from\" humans and yet different because we have the Gift of Set, does not this in itself answer the question of why we have develope d thusly? And is it not the facts contained in the question that make us so important to the Prince of Darkness? Because Set is what he Is, he needs U the Elect, who Being of dual aspects can do what he cannot. If Set were to try and resolve the issu e of the Two Lands, would he cease to be Set? We are Elect and have been bestowed with the Gift of the Black Flame. And because we must Use it, we alone have the potential of resolving/uniting the Two Lands and: \"... Become and Be what they are Become....\" Question 2: Who/What is HarWer? 6 That has got to be one of the most difficult questions to try to answer, and the first paragraph of Anubi s', in answer to this question, is mind-boggling. HarWer is Set's Opposite Self, in a similar way th at my Dark aspect is the opposite self of my light aspect. V (Hope I am right so far!) Set was never HarWer, yet there was a time when what HarWer is, was Set. HarWer was brought into Being (created), so that Set could divorce himSelf from Being his Opposite Self (HarWer) a nd, therefore, define himSelf. One thing that is more confusing than what I just said is th at if Set created HarWer, then why was HarWer once Set? Would that not mean that there wa s a time when there was only HarWer, and no Set?"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"HarWer must exist while Set exists, in order that Set may define himSelf and give of his Essence to his Elect, in order that they (the Elect) can accomplish the Great Work. Is that ... right? If that is correct, th en there will come a time afte r Xem has been actualized that whatever Set is now ... he will no longer be. For we, the Elect, in Becoming that which we are not now, or, in transforming: \"... into the new Beings or gods whose Names are no longer unknown,\" will be Set - transformed. As I relate this to you Neith, I am getting mixed feelings. Some of the time, I have a feeling that what I relate to you is correct and in Ma at, and I just do not unde rstand what it is I am writing; or I have the feeling that what I relate to you is not entirely correct and in Maat, and I do understand what I am writing. It seems ridiculous for me to have even just written this paragraph! From reading of: \"... the ancient symbolism of Se t and HarWer uniting the Two Lands,\" and reading Anubis' explanation of what that sym bolizes, I have come to the following opinion: Although the Great Work in Xem is symbolized here, the reason that it is not the result of the Great Work (symbol vs. actuality) has to do with what actualizing Xem is. The result of the Great Work in Xem will be something different from Xem. For, do we not perform the Great Work in Xem? Once this Great Work has been really accomplished, the Elect will be \"past\" Xem. Is that close to what Xem is, at least on a basic level? W I am sure Xem has multiple reasons/aspects, but I strive to at best glimpse it. Is Xem not the vehicle and/or direction of/to Xeper? From the quotations of the Statement of As taroth, I see the followi ng: Non-Elect man has long been satisfied with mastery over the mundane. Everything on \"God's good earth\" hath man sought to know. And even not of the earth, bu t extending to the cosmos. But that by itself is limitation and produces inertia. Set strives to se e to it that his Elect are able to accomplish the Great Work. We, the Elect, must become as Se t Is and in fact defi ne ourselves by creating our own Universe, one that is ordered in and of ourSelves. We must conquer our Wills and the great power of the Black Flame, and through self-discipline and work turn the Flame inward to perform the Great Work with Set, ourselves, and our Neters. Does the whole concept of what Anubis speaks of, starting with the paragraph: \"... Long ago Set experimented ...,\" and ending with the paragraph: \"... The traditional role of HarWer upon the Earth [in Khem] ...\" boil down to the Elect continuing with Xem where Xem left off so long ago? Anubis speaks from a past tense, how ever, as it seems as though this is all happening now. X The Temple of Set has been founded and reconsecrated. Are the Great Ones those of the Elect who shall actualize Xem? And once that is accomplished, will they Become those Principles of thei r Knowledge? I hope that the answers to my questions are contained in my questions. The Neters' names came about from the Functioning of the Great Ones according to their Principles. This is a clue abou t searching for a particular Neter. Do I also see our Pyramid Project in what Anubis states? I had originally intended to comment on our Pyramid Project 7 in a separate letter (and I may still do so); however, I feel there are connections in what Anubis states about: \"... the Great Ones established in their own orders,\" and the Pyramid Project. I f eel that the connection may be cosmetic (as far as actual \"orders\" are c oncerned), but perhaps it is important. Through our Pyramid Project, information and the Will of Set is passed down from Anubis, to be Understood by the Masters, and from the Mast ers to be Known by the Priesthood and from"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"the Priesthood in a manner that other Setians can comprehend. Is our Pyramid Project not in some way supposed to work in the same or similar ma nner as those ancient orders? By the way, Neith, I believe in the Pyramid and am st riving to understand more of the Magic in its potential. Set has chosen the greatest of the Great Ones, Michael Aquino, to define himself and be the Living Horus. He is the symbol of we, the El ect, as we perform the Great Work in Xem. Michael Aquino is HarWer manife st. Are we now to Become the Great Ones and in doing so Become Set, manifest? In your comment on Key #3, Neith, you state: \"It is the simple Truth which will confound us the most, because its simp licity is so unexpected.\" Have we, beginning as humans, been so lied to and so shafted and so screwed up that we really do not recognize, or have a hard time in recognizing ... the Truth? Truth has become an abstraction. In our efforts of Will to Xeper ir Xem, we are seeking to understand the abstrac tion of Truth, and, in so doing, we will have become it in Maat. To non-Elect, though, Truth w ill still be an abstract ion. So, we seek to manifest and transform the abstraction that is Xem (and that is also Truth). From Key #1: \"It is each Magician's task to compre hend Truth [Maat] and to become it.\" I read Michael Aquino's refutation of the Theory of Relativity some time ago, when he wrote it (through the Scroll , I think). Now, in the light of what you have said about it, I have been restartled. Perhaps Truth has not confounded me in this instance (or perhaps it did at first). Not only is Einstein's theory just meant for those masters of the mundane, but the limits it imposes are unfair and unjust. The theory says that there exists the finite (Great Law). We are creating our own Universe(s) in Xem and, also/besides, we are not subject to the Great Law in its totality. We are the inconsistent factor that is to embrace the new law and inhabit the new universe. By our Nature, we are infinite and a bove all, we are Gifted with the Black Flame and may/can/Will order our new Universe in and of ourSelves. Utilization of the Gift of Set will lead us to the actualization of Xem. More than just the words that I have herein written on Key #3 and vari ous relations to it ... I hope that sight is indicated by some of my ideas. How you must peer at me at times and wonder if my wanderings are going to lead me toward the accomplishment of Xeper ir Xem. If I am fulfilling my Function (which I have not yet come to clearly know), then please measure my \"success\" at the manner in which A nubis has spoken to the Order in his Keys and by your interpreting and refining of what the Hi gh Priest has said and your ability to pass insight to me. Key #4 - Comments and Analysis To struggle is to try to explain, in words, the abstract. The sublime state of Being that one is in when one experiences or Understands can not si mply be \"told\" or explained to another. As Anubis so succinctly states in Key #4: \"It will be up to you to make the symbolism 'live'...,\" and: \"The only Truth is that of Being.\" In my comments here on Ke y #4, I will try to relieve the experience I had with the Stele of Xem and hopefully express myself so that I, too, will be comprehended."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"With this Key, I will approach my comments in a different manner than I did with Keys 1, 2, and 3. Instead of following Key #4 in a step-by- step sort of analysis based on what Anubis states, I will try to inte rpret the Stele and its implications from my standpoint. Naturally, I will still have to rely on what Anubis ha s said for much of my background. In studying the Stele of Xem Y in conjunction with Key #4, I was more than once struck with a feeling of apprehension. I began to consider more seriously the possibility that not all of the Elect (past, present, and future members of the Order of Set) will actualize Xem. Z The basis for those feelings of mine were centered ar ound our human aspects. I kept on thinking that there was just no way that Xem would permit, so to speak, a non-refined or too-human Elect into its realm. That being the case, then we must heed the words contained in the first Key that state: ... to incorporate human weaknesses, imperf ections, emotional in securities, and other personal flaws into the Xeper process will resu lt in those impurities being later magnified, intensified, and manifest in Xem. Now, such flaws have to be permissible (to an extent) in humans, but not in those who would actualize Xem. AA I can't really explain why I bring this up now in my comments on Key #4. (Set knows, I try my damnedest to work out flaws from my syst em.) Nonetheless, my apprehensions surfaced and so I mention them now. Before I continue, I'd like to mention a couple of facts as a possible poin t of interest. Of the several times I \"read\" Key #4 in conjunction wi th studying the Stele, there was really only once when I really felt I was a part of the Stel e or had \"lived\" through it. When I was thusly involved, the only moments I was conscious of time were when I was disturbed. One can appreciate the illusion of time when one overcomes it. My other point concerns understanding. Since I have yet to actualize Xem, I believe my comments here can, of necessity, only indicate partial understanding of the whole or full understanding of parts. The Initiates of Xem face an awesome task. They must Will their Work so that, in the initial stages of their initiation, they can real ize Universal Maat as their own Maat. BB Their center of Heart consciousne ss, Tekh, must balance their Word or personal realization of Maat. This requires unity and a relationship of consciousness. The Initiate Works and does so in several ways. The Initiate Works in these se veral ways in concert with th e Function of the Neter Anubis. This Function is revealed in the High Priest of Set. As a new Prie st or Priestess, the Initiate has also liberated or activated the Principle of the Pentagram. No longer is the Pentagram restricted in its use or dimensi on. This is indicative of the Ini tiate's freedom. He or she is no longer bound by dimensions, time or space if he can but utilize such knowledge. The Pentagram symbolizes creation and change and, because it now is indicative of the Black Flame incarnate in the new Black Magician, it will be the torch lighting his way to that which is beyond. It is in a way a point outside of the Self from which the Initiate can begin to define himself. The Initiate links with and should have an affini ty with a predominate Neter that he will Work with in his effort. His Work should be a clue, or the nature of his Work should show signs of"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"his Function and therefore of the particular Principle of that Ne ter. To speculate, I would say that when the Initiate can real ize in himself what his Function actually is (and, therefore, the Principle of an identity of the Neter), then th at Initiate Knows what his Work is. He knows what he is to Do. At my stage of Initiation, a lthough I may indeed be Working and may even be serving the Elect from the capacity of my Function ... I do not fully recognize what Principle I embrace. When I actually manifest (and that must mean fo r a duration) my domina nt Neter, I will at least Know more of what I am to Do. So concludes my speculation on that point. The Initiate must also realize a nd strive to be conscious of the entities with whom he is and shall be working with. From Key #1, Anubis states: The Elect must realize that the Work shall re quire assistance from Se t and the other Ancient Ones for Xem is many sided. Initiation into Xem can be likened to a school of metaphysical evolution in that an Initiate must seek and be given guidance from those who already know how. CC As you stated in your comments on Key #4: \"Anubis literally leads the Initiate.\" So, although it is divine evolution of the Self, guidance is required to ensure results. After the Priest/Priestess has established a personal relationship with the Pr ince of Darkness, his \"gaze\" (as in the Stele) is turned towards his Willed destiny; his Self ahead of hims elf. And yet he must ever still be conscious of Set. And in the Stele of Xem, Set speaks... Set gazes upon the Initiate's spine, for that is where the N-energy of Neith and the F-breath of Amn (dual fires) are located. Set charges th e new Priest/Priestess and gives of his own essence. He seems to say to the Initiate, \"Y ou have touched me and been touched by me. I give to you my Gift of the Black Flame. Turn it inward upon yourSelf and evolve into Higher Man. Resolve the issue. Ir Xem.\" That is my inte rpretation, or at least what I feel the Prince of Darkness is saying. Anubis, as shown by the Black Jackal, appears to me as the entity \"asleep.\" Anubis states that: \"No motion is suggested for the Neter is not yet manifested.\" And so the Neter as shown in this way is not yet activated or Doing. When Anubis manifested in Magus Barrett, the Neter awoke. And its dreams of that which is the IAM Manuscript became conscious and therefore a target for interpretation. The Opener of the Way had manifested and, in doing so, Uttered Xem. This, of necessity, had to be followed by th e explanation of further \"speaking\" of what Xem implies. On the Stele of Xem, above (rise n to consciousness) the Black Jackal, the actual Initiation to Xem is symbolically recorded. It awaits the Initiate to live through it as a reality. \"The truth is that the symbol must fit the Neter and NOT the reverse.\" That of the world of the abstract cannot be really Unde rstood in any other way except th at of the symbol. Therefore, the symbol must be as accurate as possible in this mundane world in order to properly represent a certain Principle or Quality. Another example of th is would be in the Sphinx symbol, representing Harmachis. The Sphinx is a composite image of beast and man/woman. It must be so in order to portr ay its Principle. And the same is with other composite images and also those that appear fantastic. Studying Key #4, an idea that I had merely ente rtained in the past began to become more formidable in my mind. This vision relates to Se t, the Neters, and the Elect. I liken Set, in one"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"way, to be a macrocosmic version of the human body. This entity, this Ageless Intelligence that is Set, contains all the pa rts or more specifically all the organs of the human body. We, as the individual Elect, have our microcosmic ve rsion of Set's body. But the importance of this does not lie in the appearance of the body and organs or of what they do physically. The importance is in the Principles of each organ or part. So, if Se t is like a living, metaphysical (abstract) organism containing organs and parts, then Anubis, or the Neter Anubis, is one of the parts of that entity. The Principle of the Neter Anubis would be, if in human form and one of our organs, perhaps the liver. In the human body the liver filters that which enters our organism. It absorbs the harmful elements, if it can, and allows the nutrients to enrich the body. Although I don't really know if th e Neter Anubis is in fact the Pr inciple behind/of the liver, I think you know what I'm trying to point out. Ea ch one of the Elect, being in the Two Lands, have both the organs/parts that come with the human body, and all of the Principles of all of the Neters that make ... the Ageless Intelligen ce, or Set. And I am attempting to Become something that I, and Set, are not yet. S o, what happens to Set when He/we becomes something that He/we are not now? Perhaps then the Majesty of Set will be transformed and once in Xem, as gods whose names are known, th e issue will no longer be an issue. Phew! Xem, not being a goal in itself, is the realm 8 in which we can perform the Great Work. The transformation that will take place in that r ealm shall open the way to new continuations. Xem seems to encompass all that has passe d before it and all that currently is in regard to the Temple of Set and Xeper. Whatever the next ma jor phase or stage of our evolution shall be, and whatever name the Aeon shall be called by, it a ppears clear that it will not contain, nor be approached by man as we know him. Not even by the Elect, as we are in our current states. The realm of Xem shall only be inhabited by Di vine Man or gods. And so from that realm, after having accomplished the Great Work, sha ll Divine Man truly reign supreme and be Master. Again, this is my idea of what is implied in our future. In considering the triad of the Initiate - that of the Working and Functio nal qualities and of Set - it is Set who is the reality. The abstract rela tionship between two factor s is a basis for them to Do. The fact that the Initiate is One and the Other relates to me from the standpoint of what I read in HerBak, Egyptian Initiate . If I perceive correctly what the Master said, the One is that which alludes to the True Be ing or the Intelligence of the Heart, while the Other is the Me or shell or can be considered cerebral intell igence. In becoming Higher Man, the Initiate must see past his Nek (ego principle) and so keep active the Intelligence of the Heart. So much seems to boil down to the difference in f eeling something (appearance) and in Being something (reality), and in the necessity of Being. You state of the recognition of the self as god, that: \"It also brings with it the consciousness that so much must be done and has in fact only just begun.\" When I travelled through the experience in the Stele of Xem and tried to behold it in its Truth, I felt that the amount of time left to the Elect (and in some respects to humanity) was not sufficient enough 9 to allow us to actualize Xem. Talk about bringi ng up the rear! I also tried to perceive at what stage I was in/on concerning the pathway to Xem. I think I r ealized that I have barely glimpsed the Hall of Judgement and Universal Maat . Picturing myself as the Initi ate on the Stele, I felt (for maybe the first time) what I thought and think to be my Self in the abstract state of Initiation to Xem. Not that I had not experienced a feeling of Self before, just not in this way. What has to be overcome is immense in size, but not infi nite. All the while that I go through my ordeal and Xepering, I write about this , explore that, or dwell on some thing that does not necessarily"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"at first appear to add to my Initiation. But perhaps my studies, research and experiences do, in fact, constitute Initiation or part of it. In this respect, then, I think I must take heed and not waste such efforts on those which I c onsider not to pertain to Xeper. Comments On Key 5 10 When I try to consider the \"changes in around the Se lf\" that occur, just wh at are some of those changes under consideration? I thought about it and tried th e following on for size. As the Elect, we try to refine our inherent impurities. If we're successful, then we have changed. Not only changed for its sake, but changed in accordance with Xem. Many other changes are experienced as we progress in our initiation. We alter our likes and dislikes. Changes occur in the personal 'me' that is usually our way of presenting ourselves to the world. The way or the attitude with which we perceive reality alte rs accordingly. There are external and internal changes. We come to learn of an actuality that, yes, we can assert our Will in freedom. We can, if we Will, break down previous kinds of limitations by just Willing our Xeper. And we can go further than is possible for normal man. We have the opportunity to Xeper ir Xem. To survive change on the great scale that it is now occurring does n ecessarily come before we are able to work from that new vantage point DD that will follow mankind's extinction. Let's get real. If \"reality is mostly perceptual,\" then is there any sort of permanent fixture or tangible material 'thing' that is reality and th at can be available for reference for anyone who has eyes to see? EE Here I go with an ambiguous answer ... yes and no. In my own words and to my own Understanding, limited by my current level as it ma y be, what I believe to be reality or that which I feel constitutes real ity is dependent upon th e degree of perception [sense of Set] of the individual Elect. If you're wondering if I an swered anything, please continue to wonder. The degree of/to which we actually see reality is directly proportional to the intensity of our perceptions. Or, in anothe r way, the more developed that an individual Elect's realm of perception is, then the more comple te picture or the fuller one gets to perceive reality. Just as Xem is, as it is Underst ood, so reality is, as it is Understood. An interesting question at this point would be that, if the abov e is True, then who can and at what point can they 'see' reality in its totality? As a wild and crazy guess at an answer, I would say one could see the entirety only when one is able to remove one's Self from it. The Sixth Degree? What the Elect are doing, by combining our per ceptual realities, is acting upon the Now with our Wills to create new attitudes and environm ents. We are molding new realities. That in itself is not so strange if one st ops to consider it in light of wh at was already said in the above paragraph. Not only do we perceive reality as we are able to . .. there are seve ral levels of experiences going on at the same time. We ar e constantly moving through what 'is' and creating new Present Moments and, agai n, moving through them, and on and on. Simultaneous and successive events. \"... Xem is many sided.\" It is a fascinating and fearful experience to em brace abstract concepts that were previously only symbol to us, and to, conversely, be repulsed by so many old stand-by's and adages that we used to feel secure with. In Key 5, you state that: \"... one can and MUST do someth ing about those [changes] that involve one's Self.\" In order for me to attempt to answer the why of that statement, I harken"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"back once again to your Key 1 in which you state: \"The aspirant must be conscious of that ... which he does and does not; wh ich he Wills and Wills not....\" What we are doing, in doing the Great Work, is creating/Becoming the directi on of our evolution. Our Xepering must have direction, 11 or else we are not going a nywhere. So, it is imperative that we do something about the changes that involve our Self . After we have Willed a change [that is, if we are conscious of the fact], we must see to it that it takes on the direction that is Xem. Also, our Willed evolution will determine our order [place, Functi on] and orders in and of the realm of Xem. We have to be aware of what we are Willing and what we are doing. Yes, even our Function, which I had previously thought to be an assumed fact is, in fact, one th at we are now creating. And, I should think, one that we are assimilated to a particular Neter for. This, then, also ties in with the idea that we are to Become of th e Gods. If it can be asserted that the Elect individual is creating the Nete r/God, then it must follow th at he/she also creates the Function 12 of the God. In regard to the creation of or the Becoming the Neter, what we have to do is to recognize the nature of the Neter, so to speak. Knowing th at which we are Becomi ng/creating. I speculate that this sort of knowledge comes with or is the result of mastering one's Self. The Fourth Degree realm. I feel that a Magister/Magistra Te mpli has Mastered the Self to the degree that they know their direction to th e point where th ey more readily are ab le to continue their process of Xeper ir Xem from the standpoint of knowing their Function. In other words [since the foregoing was jumbled], I feel that the Master has elevated him or herself to the level of actually identifying at least the ba sis of their Function. In the III° realm, we are trying to bring this sort of knowledge to our surface. We are not yet at the point from which we know what and why we are doing the things we do. Since: \"The Xem Working laid the blueprint for the Coming into Being of Xem,\" I feel it is appropriate to examine the concept of the 'bluep rint.' A blueprint is a schematic diagram, a proposal, something laid out in the way of a structure ... only on paper and subject to actualization. If it is followed up and a structur e is 'built' as proposed, then the manifestation of an Abstract idea will be real. What is indica ted on a blueprint, any blueprint, is abstract and symbolic, and does not exist until whatever is th usly shown is actually constructed. That is why the blueprint for the Coming Into Being of Xem is a prophecy of what can be and not a prophecy of what will be. It all depends upon the Elect as the builder s of their structure. It is up to us to create the realm of Xem as well as to Become Xem. FF Before we can utilize the correct Principles, we must, of course, Become aware of them. The climate that you speak of, Anubis, can be consid ered as an attitude, or a Way. This way is a positive, aware state from/in which we Will be able to detect the changes you speak of, as more Keys are added. However, that does not mean that the changes are not already in effect ... and affecting the Elect. What I believe you mean is that more Keys will be required in order to make clear to us the changes that are happening now and those which will take place in the near future. As you have also stated: \"... whether or not one c hooses to recognize the ongoing changes has nothing to do with occurrence of those changes.\" Therefor e, the changes will continue to occur, as a result of our efforts, both i ndividual and collective, and as a result of mankind, and Anubis will continue to provide Keys GG for the Elect in order to ai d and guide us toward possible Understanding. Doing something about Willed evolu tion, in regard to Xem, is a many-faceted venture. It entails usi ng our Higher faculties or perhaps reco gnizing that our Higher Selves are operating freely."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Change equates to fear, and there is the very re al fear of changing. If we conquer fear, are we conquering change or, putting it another way, ridi ng \"the Magical current of the Aeon ... \"? By accepting and even utilizing the Principles and forces of change, I feel that we rise above our fears and overcome or conquer them. Perhap s 'conquering' fear is actually coming to terms with what you fear and meeting your fears on an eye-to-eye level. One can meet with and come to Understand their f ears in a similar way that one meets anything that is unknown. Approach and identify. Two ideas I have difficulty in coming to terms w ith are: one, that the word 'change' can and does have a Principle behind it a nd, two, that it is possible to 'Work' change, or, as you have stated: \"... our Willingness to Work it when inev itable change presents itself.\" Concerning \"the Principle of change,\" one is used to or is at least vaguely familiar with such words as Truth and Justice having Principl es behind them. But it is more difficult to conceive of a Principle of change. And, concerning Working change, I immediately asked myself: Work it? Work change? HH Work the Principle of change? [I know , it takes a brain to ask such obvious questions.] Anyway, at present, the way in whic h I understand this is that I equate the idea of being a latter stage in our Understanding that we have to arrive at through our Xepering. These 'steps' or stages begin with the Elect Willing their Xepering and changes. As we are doing this, another step that must be taken is that we must also rec ognize that which we are doing or Willing. Then, we must of course do so mething about those changes that involve our Selves ... as has already been mentioned. While we are changing ourSelves and, also, recognizing the changes occurring on a 'large' scale, we must use our abilities and activate that: \"Willingness to Work it....\" It is again obvious that there are orders, and that there is an order to/in Xem. We, as Elect, must be able to utilize our Sense of Set II [and you, Anubis, see to it that we are guided] and r ecognize when that constant ch ange is moving through what is, and what it is moving toward. In performing the Great Work, we are using ourSe lves in/as that most prized possession ... the Philosopher's Stone. JJ And that stone is capable of act ually transforming base material [mankind with the Gift] into precious Jewels, which are the Elect in Xem. We know that we are Alxemists. And the agent of our transfor mation is ourselves and our Higher Selves. The Elect of Set are fortunate in that we possess something that most conventional Alchemists have not/do not have, and that is direction. What we have to do, and it is a great amount, is to combine all the aspects inside of the structur e of this Aeon and Epoch and Work them. Work them inwards upon our Selves and outwards upon the Great Order. Our individual efforts will enhance and constitute our collective efforts. When Opening the Gates to my Ritual Chamber, I had thought of that act in terms of simply reaching out through the angles to effect one th ing or another. But if I just examine my motives, I can easily see that whatever I eff ected and affected, there was always change involved. Any act of Magick that I performed was directed toward doing something. And the act of doing something always effected changes ... either within myself or in someone or something else. Always there will be an aspe ct changed or the nature of something or someone changed by Will directed successfully upon the object or person in question. What would have happened if, at the time when through Magus Aquino, Set had announced his new Aeon and nobody came? KK If the Elect had not been receptive to those changes? Would Set have had to wait? Would his Majest y have faded and come to an untimely end? But then, recognizing change is the nature of th e Elect. Those who remained in the Church of"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Satan were/are not of the Elect. They remained blind to the changes, and afraid. But there will always be those who do not recognize the changes. We must BE aware. One cloudy area that I'll try to make more luci d here concerns your wo rds in stating: \"... change right out of existence.\" I know that it is a hang-up or a hanging on to the old ways of saying things that is giving me a problem. I fi nd it necessary [with your Keys and especially this one] to allow understanding of the concepts to reach my Heart first, and then to interpret what you have said and repeat it back in my own wo rds. I am sure that this is one of the things that I'm supposed to be doing, but that does not make the task a ny easier. Anyway, to get back to the above. Mankind is changing so rapidly now that every day there are indications of the coming peril, both of relatively positive and negati ve values. We are faci ng 'apparent' fuel and food shortages [what about the sun and vegetables that we can utilize?]; we are making discoveries or rediscovering certai n items in physics, etc., that are neutral in themselves but that can be handily adapted to weapons and the li ke. And, if I try hard, I can see that what all these things are ... changes; although I admit to calling them \"progress\" and \"discoveries\" and \"shortages.\" Changes are many things and can certainly include destruction. Unfortunately [for them]! What the Elect have to do is to perceive beyond the simple appearance of events and occurrences. We would be no different from non-Gifted mankind if we simply nodded our heads in tune to agreement that, yes, those bombs are capable of de stroying, and, yes, food supplies are running low. We have to see beyond symbols, which are but manifestations of Principles. Not only must we rec ognize Principles of change, but as you have stated, we must utilize them for our own \"Coming Into Being ... as Xem.\" Perhaps some of those Principles that are change are the basic cycle of death and rebirth. But, if we are able to recognize and activate the Anubian Principle LL inside of each of us, we will be able to devour that carrion that is comprised of the corpses of mankind. Ma ybe it is decaying humanity that is to be the food of the Gods who would be Xem. A question that I posed to myself was along the lines of: what is the main difference between Set stating that: \"Mankind now hastens toward an annihilation\" and any number of other people that have predicted 'doomsday' so many tim es in the past? Previous to the inception of the Temple of Set, and even during this Ae on, there have been many who have echoed Set's statement and said that the human race is head ing toward, and working at, destroying itself. So, what is the difference? Da y and Night. Just as Set knew wh en to wind up the process of purification [in the Age of Satan], so He kne w of the actual acceleration Principle in manifestation that had truly gone beyond the point of stopping. And, having perceived of things both unheard of and unthought of by mankind, Set spoke through his Magus ... who Uttered Xeper ... and through this Magus, the El ect were guided and charged to Become. Initially, only to Become. We needed to know how to evolve; what it felt like to evolve and all special aspects of evolution of the Self before we could utilize Xeper. As an analogy, consider the training of any professional athlete or businessman. They are required to complete extensive training before they could accomplish anything tangible or recognizable. There is an or der to Becoming. One must BE MM a doctor before one can practice medicine. One must Know Xeper before one can Xeper toward anything. Xem is the compliment to Xeper."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"We are Elect to Become what mankind cannot . We Will succeed mankind. We Will transcend the man-God and Become the God-(man). But, a llow me to get back to the idea of direction, in reference to the Words that ha ve been Uttered ... thus far. Each Word that has been Uttered has been so reve aled in an order and in a fashion so that it compliments and utilizes the others. Each Word and the concepts/potentials thereof can be considered a stage of initiation that has to be taken in its proper turn and Understood before one can go forward to a further level of initia tion. As we, the Elect, travel the way in initiation, we absorb the basic qualities [or an amount thereof] of each Word, realm, Degree, and then are enabled to go further. Each Word is utilized toward the Understanding of the next Word [which is a stage]. Each Initiate is the sum of hi s/her knowledge. Nothing is lost along the way. This is so in the same manner in which we have elevated ourselves to another Degree or realm [such as from Setian I° to Adept], we have al ready absorbed and utilized all that is within the first degree NN that we were able to experience. We incorporat e that which we have experienced and thus we are the sum of our experience. The fact does re main, however, that we are constantly acting from the standpoint or perspective of the 'now,' and that is where we have initiated to at any particular stage ... including that wh ich we have already experienced. In order to truly evolve, we must change in accordance to/with Xem. What good is changing just because we know how? That would mean th at we would have ceased to grow. Stasis. By perceiving our Higher Self Working on Becoming Xem, we are, in fact, Xepering toward Xem and evolving. No one Word is a goal. One cannot stop at Xeper, or even at Xem. I speculate that when the time comes where we ha ve utilized the tool that is Xem and have Become Xem, there will be yet another further realm/aspect that we shall strive toward. Another Word will be Uttered OO and once again the Elect, by th en transformed into that which we are not now, will have direction in wh ich to Work toward from the standpoint of our new realm. However, such a Word could not be Uttered until its time. We must be transformed before we will have the perspectiv e necessary to comprehend the next stage of our evolution. Hopefully, what I have said in my comments have indeed touched upon the essence of Key 5: fear. What do we fear the most? Change. If I have spoken of change, then I have spoken of fear. And, although I know that I st ill cling to some things that are known and familiar, I am being guided so that I also know what I must do. \"Therefore, let the Elect who resolve to Become of the Gods also resolv e to conquer fear that they mi ght Xeper ir Xem.\" Hail, Elect, that we might Become the abstraction that is Xe m!

Other \"chambers\", right down to the foundation, would be occupied by the Magistri, the Priesthood, Adepts, and Setians I°, respectively. E ach Master of the Temple would have several Priesthood III° members assigned to her. In turn, each Priest/ess would have several Adepts and Setians assigned to him. Collective thought and brainstorming processes were encourag ed. In many respects, the Pyramid Project facilated clear lines of communication. Today' s Orders and Pylons act as Pyramid-like structures. B. Well... mostly no. Until I had afforded mo re serious consideration to Dr. Aquino's writings, and bore witness to the Work of others such as Ip sissimus Lewis and Magister Menschel [and in recent times, Priest Laak so], I didn't really have a grasp on what Setian Intellectualism was all about, but nevertheless l eaned into it with mucb fervour.

It's easy to see how, in a Temple replete with esoteric te rms and jargon, confusion arises. D. Speaking of language, does one initiate in to Xem, In Xem, within Xem - or some variation of the above? I used to feel this was a very impor tant issue. Like others who 'lived through' the Xem era, and are asked about its permutations, I occasionally hear this question. Whatever your view on the va lidity of Xem, the value of this kind of discussion resides in your unde rstanding of Xem; not in becoming trapped in semantics. E. What do you fear the most? What should you feat the most? Most of you have probably already learned that your trep idations about fear centre ar ound the process of fear. We fear, for wont of a better way to describe this. We don't value being upset, angry, or confrontational; so subsequently loathe any participation in the process of fear. Often enough, the event which we fear arrives, occu rs, and is... anti-climatic. we discover that it was the fear we were ascending to, it was fear itself we idolatrized. F. As out first \"Working Year\" volved, Se tians participated in a goodly amount of conversation about Neters. Specifically, when we were Recognized to the II°, we experienced inherent self-expectations a bout pursuing Neter Work. My \"first\" Neter developed [perhaps it was really created] from a personal history with ESP and psychic phenomena. I wanted to be oracular; and th ere are times when I regret the ensuing quickening. Today's perspective tells me that it is not as critical to 'have', affiliate with, or Work with a Neter as it is to know, or have a Sense of the Self. G. Are we, or have we ever been a Temple preoccupied with deat h? The annoying answer of \"yes\" and \"no\" presides here. People are fascinated with, abhorred by the idea of, or emersed in trying to understand what physic al death means. Yet, as the Keys and commentary suggest, there are deaths other th an those of the physical body. In today's T_S_, there are several Orders which might be considered as \"death defying\". What I find most irksome (you may too) about ramp ant speculation on physical demise is that, to out knowledge as a species or race [S etians], no one we know of who is now physically dead has clearl y or obviously come back to tell us about it. H. One of the more mystifying symbols of th e language of Xem is two-fold: the Nameless and faceless Initiate. Confusind [obscuring?] the realities behind th is term are thoughts og the S/self ahead of the S/self [make your own decision on co rrect capitalisation here]. Knowing one's real Name or Face... is this something you would like to pursue? My suggestion is that you concentrate on the second of this two-fold task, and perhaps employ \"mirror magic\" to do so. I. What was I talking about? Looking back at my obscure terminology, I'd say the interference is that the Initiat e's Work in this arena includes more than just academia. I offer this: understanding something (or an aspect of something) fully and completely suggests an empathic relationship. In the langu age of Xem, we speak of BEING. In this respect, actualizing Xem is commensurate with being in a state of empathy with Xem. Put simply, actualizing Xem is BEING Xem. Clear as mud? J. In Barrett's time, the crux of our Xem Work was the Ordeal of Initiation. I discovered (well into my Work with Xem) that there we re several - sometimes concurrent - Ordeals of Initiation. [In one respect, ths allowed a fine-tuning of my Understanding of ECI magical techniques. For more information on that, look into past Conclave Workings.] Known as Ordeal(s) of Change or times of the Dark Night of the Soul (DNS), various Rites of Passage ere involved. Regardless, first and foremost was a commitment to the Ordeal. It should be added here that Xeper, Remainfest and Runa have their Ordeals of Change."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"K. Setians do not aspire to be \"lower man\" ! However, \"Higher Man\" shouldn't be thought of as merely being the oppos ite of \"lower man\". As the consciousness of the Self ascends the Tree of Life, it allows for greater upon greater levels of objectivity. Higher Man, in one of his many gui ses, is objective Man. L. I really shouldn't attempt this (!), but let me give a shot. When we discuss the core-level of an Initiate, we talk about her \"state of Being\". To use a simplified example, one's state of Being is very different from being mad, being depressed; even different from being esoteric. When you think of the word \"Being\", think of it as a noun and a verb. Think of it with the word \"the\" or \"Your\" in front of it. I'm more interested in \"your Being\" (ie. you as an entity) than I am in your persona, personality, or collection of characteristics. One could say \"the nature of my Being is calm\"and be correct in her usage of the term. You can also state \"I witnessed (or experienced) Masgieter Neilly's Being\", and again be correct in your phraseology. Wasn't it Frank (or Further) who sang \"Don't dream it, Be it!\" The rough translation - immerse yourSelf in wh at you are, so that what you are isn't solely made up of characteristics, persona lity, or habits. Allow the core Being to emerge. In doing so, you will BE. The act or process of BEING is a conscious one. Earlier on, I spoke about \"BEING Xem\". In ef fect, this meant you full Being is involved in the substance of Xem; ie., you are Xem. M. The stress is placed on the doorstep of f ear. The more 'fears' you cannot conquer in Xem - in whatever form (insecurities, impurities , imbalances, etc.) - th e greater the chances that your Xem Work will be unsuccessful or incomplete. Fears are magnified in Xem environs. Most of us in the Temple have heard of \"Id monsters\". The more your 'fears' overtake you in Xem, the more active your Id monsters. In aspiring towards/for Xem (using the principles of Xeper, Remanifest, Runa), you must equally aspire to identify, lessen, and if possible, eliminate negative elements. [See Note E above, for more on \"fear\".] N. How do you come to know about [your] Nete r? Well, there need not be a Neter on your immediate horizon. Nor, as discussed earli er, should you get hung up on trying to find the right one, or right name. If you nevertheless plan to pursue the Neter issue, there are avenues you can follow. None are guaranteed. Try sampling your favorite collection of literature and mythology; be it Greek, Egyptian, Nordic, whatever. Seek, within yourself, imagery that you have always been attracted to or always used (yes, it can be that obvious). Examine creatures, both mythical and real, for their powers and abilities and determine if you feel such things are part of your genuine makeup. Further, determind through Work and introspection the nature of the inner Self. Often, it's this which provides clues wh en nothing else will. Again, these techniques may not work at all for you. The reasons could be numerous, or it simply could be that it's not appropriate or timely for you to be pursuing Neter Work. Finally, look for new search methodologies. All things, even techniques, undergo the process of Xeper. O. I questioned this passage because I couldn't see the forest for the trees. Neither was Magus Barrett clear on this. [On reading th e Keys, you may feel that same level of frustration. Barrett claimed that the Keys were written in plain English. That notwithstanding, my question c oncerning the \"facilities\" we re never satisfactorily answered.] The \"facilities\" we re partly Xemset property, partly the furnishings, and"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"partly the way in which Barrett operated magi cally, and partly a consensus reality which you either bought or didn't. P. For all those fans (!) of Her-Bak , much was said in the two stories about the Intelligence of the Heart. I have already discussed some of my adventur es between the two Intelligences: that of the Intellect and that of the Heart. I flag it here because both Intelligences are required for Balance. Being totally 'logical' is as bad as operating 'solely' from the intuitive. Most people ar e prominently one way or the other. The good news is that you shouldn't have to search too far for the compliment. [Of passing interest, some Setians have had sport in comparing Intelligence(s) to Orders. For example: The Order of the Trapezoid has been compared to the Order of the Vampyre; intellect vs. intuition, respectiv ely. The reality is that both Intelligences are present in both - and all - Orders.] Q. Anything made manifest is in potentia a sym bol, picture, or represen tation of that which is abstract. Conider those events in the universe which are Causal (at the level of Principle). They occur - or simly are - and cause subsequent degrees and modifications of corresponding terran events. We s hould avoid confusing terran events (manifestations) with their respective cause s (Principles). Instead of constructing symbols in an effort to create the abstracti ons, we need to construct the symbols based on existing abstractions . When we manifest an abst raction, we show evidence of aspects of our Work. [The Word Remanifest had not been Uttered at the time of Xem. Ask yourself how it changes, and augments, what I've just stated.] R. There are many Offices in the Temple of Set: the Office of the High Priest; the Office of the Executive Director; the Office of the Treasurer; to name a few. Here, the word \"Office\" denotes Function rather than ra nk. In my Office as a Councillor [and former Chairman of the Nine], I respond to issues by way of Functioning in an appropriate manner. First and foremost, I'm responsive to Set as I intuit the way in which Set has designed that Function. In a ddition to Offices of the Temple, there are Pylons and Orders, Sentinels and Grand Masters. Take h eed . . . there is one Office so sacred and important that all Setians need to know of it. Young Adepts, this is especially important for you; it is the Offi ce of the Priesthood. S. On occasion, I've been called upon to delineate between the deadwood and working Initiates in the T_S_. In response, I've sa id it is the latter w ho comprise the \"Inner Temple.\" This, regardless of Degree or stat us. Even so, there re mains a strong validity to the idea that when one enters the \"Inner Temple\" she enters the Priesthood. [See also Note 5 for more on the \"Order of Set.\"] T. Like in the proverbial statement of 'having one foot in the grave', Elect Beings walk the Two Lands. In its abstract meaning, the lands in question are those of the Intellect and the Heart. In terran terms, the lands may be comprised of those things which we do which are strictly human versus those thi ngs whixh contribute to our Self-created Universes. To survive daily living, we do wh at we as people need to do. To survive mortality, as gods and godesses in the Becoming, we do much more. U. Much has changed since when I first spoke those words. I'm in agreement with them still, but in recent years ma ny are the Setians who have que stioned the extent to which Set is concerned with the individual . Much of this began with one Initiate. For example, today's Setian might say: 'Since Set's experiment Worked, is there any need for Set to have a continued interest in the mechanisms, Workings, or even the Initiates of the Aeon?' We find comfort in know ing that Set is not God. If we assigned"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Set the same qualities as G od - healing, intervention, favour itism, to name but three - then wouldn't we be casting him in God's, and to an extent our own, image? Let me stir up this alchemical mix: I feel Set has intervened in my life on more than one occasion (ie., beyond Ordaining me to his Prie sthood). Even as I say this, I'm thinking that it would make Setian sense if Set - with the exception of a very few earth shaking events in my life - did not intervene or concern himself fu rther with me. If you aspire to and attain the Priesthood, you will be set free. From there on, it's up to you to attain Set- like status. Set does some initial stretchi ng and extending toward you; but there will come a time when your continued existence will depend on your reaching at a Set-like state of Being. V. As the Temple has evolved, so have Setians within it, and those newly entering it. Most Setians today would be able to draw thei r own conclusions concerning Set/HarWer and themselves/HarWer. As Set has done, so can the Setian. W. My point here is not about the 'Great Work '; rather, it's about my struggles (in those corresponding three paragraphs of commen tary and in others throughout my entire series of comments) to explai n, understand, eludicate that wh ich was/is either intensely personal or abstract. Look at my discussion of the 'Great Work' with today's lens. I was trying too hard. I was trapped in the old 'can't see the forest for the trees' syndrome. One of Xm's fundamental lessons is that the In itiate will cut his own way through the forest. This means that s/he will encounter and unr avel mysteries in a uniquels personal way. Applying myself toward a generic - rather than personal - explanation of what was 'personally abstract' seemed a fruitless and bi tter battle. Who else is like me, or can understand me, as I do? X. One of the more fascinating phenomenon in our lives is that Aeonic Words (and other things) possess both chronological and concurre nt lives. The words that 'were' still are. Even if one Word was Uttered 'after' the ot her, it still is. In my original comments above, you'll see that this seemed confusing to me. Yet, all things we have ever seen, heard or otherwiseexperienced still exist. If th ere is a 'core' Self, one which existed prior to its current incarnation, its memories are the sum of all it has experienced. What is happening now is very much formed from what happened 'before' now. What happens moments, hours, months and years from now is very much a part of what is happening... now. Y. The Stele of Xem accompanied Key # 4. To me, it remains one of the most marvellous collages of (relevant) symbolism I've ever encountered. My persona l testimonial to the substance of Xem was to the greater extent wrapped-up in my comments on Key # 4 (essentially, my comments on the Stele). I go on to mention [page 14] that \"there was really only once when I really felt I was a pa rt of the Stele or had 'lived' through it.\" In doing that, I was beginning to tackle the real Work involved in Xem. Z. Large deal! Does it matter? Is Xem such a se lect club that, to be left out of it means [fill in this blank ]? There are Initiates in the Temple of Set - many of them - who (a) were not around when Xem was Uttered and aren't in terested in reading up on it; or, (b) who were around when it was Uttered an d (still) aren't interested; or (c) who are quite busy pursuing other isues, Words, directions a nd don't want to include Xem (at least not currently). If I pursue Runa and runic practices, am I missi ng the Xem bier? Could I get to the same 'place'/state of Being via Xeper, Runa, or Remanifest? Any discussion of Xem and its importance as a Word must be preceded by Xeper."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Without Xeper, Xem wouldn't exist. I made an earlier comment [see Note X] about the concurrent condition of our Ae onic Words. Perhaps this offers the best approach to initiation. Each successive Word, though possess ing qualities of previous Words, is unique unto itself. Each exists concurrent with the others. Each has an effect on us; the extent of which depends upon how conscious of each Word we are. I believe that all Words and their influences permit us a wide scope of initiatory e xploration and growth potential. However, because each is unique, it can be said that Xem offers something which the other Words do not. Coming full spiral, do you have to buy into a Word - Xem in this case - in order for you to gain from it; or to know you will lose so mething if you do not pursue it? In the same way that Set does not think of those who do not think of him are the Aeonic Words. Proof of whether someone has gained some thing through/within Xem which cannot be gained except through Xem will be revealed only through the matrix of a Being. AA. I take it back. Whatever flaws we haven't worked out of our system are brought forward into successive states of Being. The only difference is that, hopefully, we understand our flaws more fully and are subsequently more capable of dealing with them (or without them). BB. Maat, like many other adopted Setian ge ms, is quite at home discussed on its own, outside of the context of Xem. However, th is reference to Maat makes the point that there are truths both subjectiv e and objective. If there we re a single course for all- pervading truth, it would be of immeasurable be nefit to the Initiate; especially so if she could bring that truth into hers elf and make it her own! Such is not the case, so the more one Works without lust for resu lt, and is 'pure in thought and deed', the more refined her truth(s). CC. Was I commenting on one of Barrett's self -fulfilling prophecies? Donning the cynic's hat for a moment, what better way to ensure importance (and longe vity) than building into your schema a rule that says aspirant s must seek out those [few sages] who have been there and know how! Yet, in keeping with what Xem is and is not, the above statement is consistent. Xem cannot be \"taught\", so under the most ideal of circumstances the aspirant must initiate her interest in aspiring towards it. Then, shee must seek out the tools which othe rs before her have identified. Of interest in passing is that in late XXVIII, articles appearing in the Scroll told of renewed efforts to understand Xem on tw o fronts. One was an announcement to all Setians on the possibility of forming a Xem Py lon, and the other an article by an Initiate who stated that he had forged ahead in unde rstanding Xem without the [full] aid of the aforementioned \"sages.\" DD. Interesting thing about vantage points ; as you Xeper towards Xem, Remanifesting secrets found through Runa, you will acheive many plateaus. Each allows you to catch the vaguest glimpse of the next. Xem allows the Initiate to create states and stages which are both concurrent and which posse ss chronicity. One of the hallmarks of initiating into Xem is that you pretty much al ways have that 'vaguest glimpse' of what you're heading towards next. EE. More than ever, it's clear \"reality is most perceptual\". One can start with the most basic of examples: how we perceive colour. If seve ral of us were in the same room, looking at a bowl of red Jello, there w ould exist several 'reds'."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Each of us would form a different descrip tion of red, based on how the frequencies of light which made up the colour red were in terpreted by our brains. There is no such thing as one reality. In this, and most other cases involvi ng the human species, reality is totally perceptual. Even were we able to s ee the bands of light, we would describe them differently, each according to his own interpretation. Amn has said \"Nothing is as it seems.\" A ll material objects are 'simply' specific arrangements and constructs of the building blocks of nature. The reductionist might tell us that what we see as four-squared realit y is an illusion. I'm inclined to agree. In my original comments on Key #5, I suggested there was a direct connection between the intensity of our focus and the amount of reality we experience. Looking back at those comments, I would suggest that many of those powers so often ascribed to psychics are actually enhancements to existi ng sensory apparatus. With respect to Xem, those Initiates who have the keenest percep tions of all - who 'see' the furthest, or experience life in its fullest - are also thos e who have the clearest picture of reality. FF. This holds true moreso today than in Barre tt's time in the Temple. In this paragraph I stated: \"That is why the blueprint for the Coming Into Being of Xem is a prophecy of what can be and not a prophecy of what will be.\" The more advanced the Grade of an Initiate, the more vital it is for her to (a) have a blueprint, and (b) make it so. As the years roll by, the general 'climate' for human ity has become progressively hostile. Even in the years since Barrett (and so many others ) have left the Temple, the crush of day- to-day living has increased im mensely. The interesting thing about blueprints is that, unlike the finished structures, they are two-dimensional and lack the 'continuum' aspect that the element of time adds to creation. GG. We've seen that this was not to be. Nor after he left the Temple, as far as we can tell, did barrett provide any further Keys of Xem. Inst ead of lamenting this facet of truth, we should be asking ourse lves if it matters. HH. I've long since lost the frustration over wh at at the time seemed much like a novel, even unusual concept. As we strive towards mainta ining a consciousness of all that we do, is there any reason why we can't include an Awareness of what is going on around us? Being aware of Change allows us the luxury of being able to \"Work it\" or Work with it. Change is the largest of all fulcrums, which, with an applied force of Will, can move or redistribute massive structures. II. One doesn't hear of this often these da ys. I was a III° Priest when I first Became a member of the Council of Nine. One of the r easons then-High Priest Barrett felt I was a suitable candidate for the Nine was my Sense of Set. Such a quality - or set of qualities - is all-but intangible except in the way the Initiate demonstrates it. One of the key indegrients in a well-defined Sense of Set is Balance. You've heard many a senior Initiate harp on the Principl e of Balance. The further al ong on the initiatory path, the more defined (and secure) 'Sense' of Balance you need. JJ. We found out a long time ago, thanks partly to the pioneering Word of Dr. Aquino, that we are it. There is no external magical elix ir, agent, or mineral, which once obtained, will transform us. In seeking to be Alxemists, the search for the Philosopher's Stone begind and ends with the Self. KK. The question is as equally valid today as it was when I first posed it. Contemporary Words esist - Xeper, Xem, Remanifest, R una - yet the masses do not apprehend them"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"directly. People are affected by the Words, by the Aeon, but are larg ely, if not totally unaware of it, or even what an \"Aeon\" is . Mankind continues to (unconsciously) ignore what Satan-Set has announced. It could be said that it doesn't matter. I'd rather say that only those Elect enough to hear it will respond to it. This do es not exclude the countless Initiates who are not Setians. On the ot her hand, this does exclude the \"masses\". LL. Anubis/Barrett told us that we needed to understand, even actualize the Anubian Principle in order to fully apprehend and Become Xem. We understood the nature of this Principle, and were able to apply it. Each and any 'prominent' Neter has a Principle behind it; at the root of all (Re)manifestati ons exist Causal Principles. And this is my contemporary point. We must strive to unders tand the nature of the Neters [see my earlier Note F]. If you intend to Wotk with/in a Neter at all, it's important to realize that Neters have (or will come to have) a Func tion. To an extent, even if you do not have that Function, it will prevail. It 's in your best interest to perhaps first learn about the Function before plunging into \"Becoming\" the Neter. MM. To BE or not to be; as you've no doubt already noticed. We seem to use terms like \"BE\"/\"Being\"/\"being\" almost interchangeab ly. Depends on whom you ask! Here is one Initiate's notes on correct usage: BE/ING: So totally immersed in and w ithin a reality that you possess a genuine empathetic relationship with that reality. You may in fact BE it. You and that quality or characteristic are (in practic al terms) inseparable. Being: Sentient life forms [Setians and others ]; state of.

Life on Earth is itself a sufficiently difficult problem without attempting to solve what each of us at sometime or the other susp ects may in the end turn out to be a purely academic question. The attendant puzzles and semi -solutions presented by it have driven men mad, but it is when the mind turns itself toward thoughts of an end to the personal experience of living that it begins to feel a subtle apprehension manifes ting itself. We have not known what it is to experience not-being, although ther e was a time when we were not. Our intellects can speculate singularly and collectively on the subject, but they can never display complete un-being to another. The very idea is self-contradictory, and so must remain completely academic because of the paradox involved. Intere stingly, the nothing can be identified -- not experienced -- since consciousne ss [or being] is central to identification and recognition. Do we live only one time? Are our minds and bei ngs, our souls, that personality which makes us unique among even our own human, let alone Setian, kind bound to come into existence once only and then fade when the metabolism fails? Further, is the choice one's own, or is it a process determined by an intelligence beyond our control? [The presence of a governing intelligence being brought into the question open s the door to yet another complete arena of its own: sooner or later, as the ontological argum ents of St. Anselm indicate, further complications arise because in such decisions as who returns and in what form, a regulating intelligence can neither be dispensed with nor c onceived not to exist If the decision is made by a self-governing being, the choice is its own and no outside intelligence need be courted or placated in order for a return or remanifestati on to take place.] The wordings and nuances of the question are enough to fill many a book, and th e approaches taken are even far more extensive. Yet the end of the phys ical is one that no man can fi ght against and win forever. \"I am Death,\" said that personage to Everym an, \"and no man do I fear.\" When it becomes apparent that physical weapons are of no ava il against such a desti ny, the mind refuses to accept simple surrender. It would be all too easy to go gently into the darkness and cease to be, were it not for the fact that the singular cons cious self within cries bitterly agai nst such a fate, and reaches out for other weapons to use, weapons of the mind and self.

His further reasoning is that the essence is et ernal -- past, present, and future . It is the second life, the one he identifies as the life of the spirit, that Kant concludes must live on as soul after the separation from the body. Anthony Flew, in contributing to the Encyclopedia of Philosophy , identified three main doctrines in the theory of immortality: th e Immortal-soul, Reconstitution, and Shadow-man doctrines. His explanations of these three are useful in placing the personal quest for a workable synthesis in a clearer light. The Immortal-soul doctrine holds that for th e duration of the life of the body, there is somehow attached [or incorporated into or im prisoned therein, if thos e terms sound better] a soul which is seen in itself as having subs tance even while lacking the quality of being corporeal. Plato injects the belief into the Phaedo when relating the events prior to Socrates' death. The soul, reasoned Socrates, cannot be in harmony with the body, or else when the physical decayed the soul would also face its end. His belief in the substance of the soul and its difference with the kind of matter that ma kes up the body is an a ttractive part of the Immortal-soul doctrine. The second, the Reconstitution doctrine, Flew describes as \"in a pure form, a direct and simple belief.\" Its beliefs are dependent on th e presence of the body durin g life and then later in the resurrection of it. More accurately yet, Flew continues, the second doctrine consists of an insistence on reconstituting the body with the soul in orde r to have a complete human person who could then go about the business of being immortal. The flaw, insofar as Setian thought goes, is that it depends on an omni potent power to produce an immortal Being. The third doctrine, that of the Shadow-man, is ba sically a belief in a type of astral body, and is an attempt to combine doctrines one and two. The combination sits well with white light practitioners, in that it does not force a great deal of debate and conveniently allows for any number of interpretations of exactly what is meant by spirit/soul/being. It can also be exploited easily enough for those using it in th e Humpty Dumpty way in that it can mean anything they want at a given moment. Flew makes yet another pertinen t observation. \"There is nothi ng,\" he writes, \"to stop anyone from giving what sense he likes to the term 'd isembodied person.' The difficulty is to attach enough sense to the expression so that some discovery about disembodied people could provide us with grounds for believing that we surv ive death.\" Flew's finger is on the pulse of the question in that quote. While we within ourselves, selves made more acute in their awarenesses, are convinced that the possibilities are high that our souls are either starting out on the path to immortality or have been trave ling it for some time, ot her than ourselves we cannot offer clinical evidence beyond Pogo's \"Us is it.\" I put to you, howev er, that the proof necessary to convince me pers onally of the viable option of immortality will be my own success at establishing a soul that will not fade unless it should decide to do so on its own. It is not absolutely necessary to provide any personal truth about this or any other subject to others in order to prove any point; Crowley-li ke, I believe in each man cutting his own path through the jungle. We can use the thoughts and conclusions of others to form our own approaches, but we have read in the Book of Coming Forth by Night of the texts of others and affronts to the self."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Occultists for many an age have found reassurance in the con cept of reincarnation. Those seeking information from the good Mr. Webster will find the word to mean \"1. rebirth (of the soul) in another body; 2. a new incarnation; 3. the doctrine that the soul reappears after death in another and different bodily form.\" Such a doctrine goes a long way toward dispelling the fear of not-being, in that it re futes oblivion as the final chap ter of our individual books; its appeal is alluring enough to minds already condi tioned to a greater or lesser degree by what Descartes saw as the uncertainty brought a bout by accepting the beliefs and authorities encountered in youth and then la ter coming to suspect error a nd prejudice to be resident within those beliefs. The root problem facing us is the \"how\" of continuation, not the first mind-framed question of whether it is actually possible. Our long habit of living and doing Magic indisposes us to one day no longer indu lging in those challe nges and pleasures, and while Magicians do not generally give way to f ear of the unknown, they do plan ahead for the yet-to-be, thereby displaying the tendency to have a higher degree of goal orientation than their non-Magician cousins. The desire to know the how and why of the cosmos far outweighs the desire simply to be entertained, and has as a result consequences wh ich develop into a far more thorough and complex manner. Cool, cl ear reasoning has taken the place of fearful superstition; in the long run the former produces far more lasting results. \"Masters, doubts of this sort brought me up shor t before ever I watched a funeral Now I've seen death and I ask myself, if death is the final end what use is knowledge? The singer was right ... better enjoy life without care. In which case temple and wisdom are absurdities, funeral rites are absurdities. Yes, that's what I've thought. But I also told myself it would be another absurdity to reach this conclusion without proofs.\" \"Do you yourself believe, Her-Bak, th at death is a final end?\" aske d the Master of Mysticism. \"My heart refuses it. But I must find the 'question' I'm to put without asking what I believe.\" The Masters received this with satisfaction, a nd Her-Bak resumed. \"The funeral rites affected me through my love for Nadjar. I understood what separation means. Before death he was like ourselves ... he breathed the same air, saw th e same things. Now his eyes see nothing, his nostrils breathe nothing. Is there some part of h im that still sees? If not, it's total annihilation. If so, does he see what we don't? In which case, are our eyes dead to that world we don't see? If it were so, would our life and his only be separated by a difference? Where is his life, his personal life? Is what he learnt dead with him? A master-car penter said to me, 'Death is change.' If the body is mummified it can change no longer, in what does the change lie? People talk of the ba and ka that can, as they say, retur n. What are they? Where? Their body is dead. How can they live if they have no body to eat with? And here 's another question ... what is it to be alive? But there's too much I don't know. I don't know if this is the fundamental question.\" - Her-Bak , Vol. II Her-Bak's speculations reflect our own observati ons, questions, and methods of analysis: each apparent conclusion is reviewed and dissected in order, Hege l-like in our self-correcting sortings out of apparent or po ssible truths while en route to a workable Absolute, that no crucial element is overlooked. Young Her-Bak is on the path of philosophy, the starting point of which can originate only from within the mind in order to evolve outward. Although we run the risk of appearing morbid by what can become an obsession with finding the answer to"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"life beyond the physical, the quest is an unavoida ble one. The question we face is that: what lives, and how does it do so? Her-Bak is not the only work to have questione d life and survival. To again quote from the text, \"Priests take the place of God and arrogate to themse lves the right to govern men's consciences.\" It is not only th e right to govern the conscience, but the directions of monetary flows and power, usually in the direction of the priests or ministers them selves. It is hardly profitable for the masses to become capable of, le t alone fluent in, self-thought; to become so opens the door to examination and education, a condition to be avoided by the power seekers. You have only to look about you to see volum e after volume devoted to denials of the essential separateness of the in dividual [See also Chapter 2, Approaches to the Universe in the Crystal Tablet of Set .] Christian and other approaches to the question of life either sidestep separateness and its implications or repudiate it completely, ther eby of course affirming their at least outward statement of the We are one, we are none enslavement. It is primarily the Magical societies which have been the ones to investigate the dark avenues of the unknown with far less fear, they themselves having the grea t lovers of truth from past ages to thank for a part of the foundation of fearle ssness. Rene Descartes, for example, lived in an age when the memory of burnings at the stake was never too far away, and yet his speculations on perception and sensation input not only took him to \"I think, therefore I am,\" but laid further groundwork for the separateness and immunity to physical deterioration of the soul. The main emphasis underlying Descartes' examinations of the relationship between man and his universe carried a strong Christian bias, although this can be understood in its proper context when considering the temporal power held by the religious of the 1600s during which he lived, as Leon Daley points out in his critique of Descartes' compositions [The Philosophy of Rene Descartes ]. \"There is no doubt,\" wrote Fr ancis Huxley, \"that man has a fatality for getting drunk, both literally and metaphorically. He can get drunk w ith glory, power, ideas, lusts, and religious certitudes as easily as be can with alcohol. He enjoys putting himself into a passion for the feeling of life it gives him.\" There are few pl aces in which man has been more tempted to make himself drunk than in that area of givi ng himself a sense of security about what may happen to his personality , his unique self, his ba . The awareness of the presence of this singular part of humanity gene rally is met much in the same way Fowles describes man's reaction to the nemo: \"...instead of utilizing the nemo as we would any other force, we allow ourselves to be terrified by it, as primitive man was terrified by lightning. We run screaming from this mysterious shape in the middle of our town, even though the real terror is not in itself, but in our terror at it.\" It is that terror of the mysterious shape that causes mankind to find the extinction of the individual existence, with the absorption of th e soul into a supreme spirit, highly desirable even while paradoxically there coex ists a deep dread of that same dissolution. Such an end is of little interest to us. It is instead those authors who have turned their attention toward continuing that special conscious awareness who attract us Although it is not put in those exact words, the main aim of past Magical endeavors has been an ongoing state of becoming. Like the historical Hellene polis , the view was always one of becoming what was thought the best and greatest , but never actually attaining such a status. [There always seems to be at least one more door and a minimum of one more question once aspirations are reached, hen ce the impossibility of beco ming all and simultaneously maintaining self-reference boundaries. The Magica l concept of Xem has far greater meaning"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"when defined in such terms, and even though the nuances understood by different Initiates regarding Xem almost approach a state of cultura l relativism, I remain c onvinced that there is a tool that can be turned to use in the con cept.] The arrival of Xeper did not automatically simplify matters, but it did refine the search to a previously unknown state of sophistication which allowed for the disposal of useless lu mber through subtle, experienced, and complex approaches. It is the quest of always becoming, a task which is one of the significant keys to living for as long as the self-sufficient psyche Wills. \"Let us enquire,\" said Socrates , \"whether the souls of dead me n really exist in the house of Hades or not. Well, there is the very ancien t legend which we remember, that they are continually arriving there from th is world, and further that they come back here and are born again from the dead. If that is true, and the li ving are born again from the dead, must not our souls exist there? For they could not be born ag ain if they did not exist; and this would be sufficient proof that it is true, if it should be really shown that the living are born again from the dead and from nowhere else. But if this is not true, we must ta ke some other line.\" - Phaedo A. Merritt questioned the existence of the self in this way: \"Graydon, you have aroused old thoughts. Often I ha ve asked, 'What is it that is I, Adana' – and never found the answer. None of my ancestors has ever returned to tell me. Nor any of the Old Race. Now is it not strange, if there be an other life beyond this one, that not love nor sorrow, wit nor strength nor compassion has ever bridged the gap between them? Think of the countless millions who have died since man became man, among them seekers of far horizons who had challenged unknown perils to bring back tidings of distant shor es, great adventurers, ingenious in artifice; and men of wisdom who had sought truth not selfishly but to spread it among their kind; men and women who had loved so greatly that surely it seems they could break through any barrier, re turn and say – 'Behold, I am! Now grieve no more!' Fervent priests whose fires of faith had shone like beacons to their flocks -- have they come back to say -- 'See! It was truth I told you! Doubt no more!' Compassionate men, lighteners of burdens, prelates of pity -- why have they not reappeared crying, THERE is no death!' There has come no word from them, Why are they silent?\" \"Yet that proves nothing. Would that it did -- for then we would be rid of sometimes troublesome thoughts. But it does not, for look you, Graydon, we march beside our sun among an army of other stars, some it must be with their own circling worlds. Beyond this are other armies of suns, marching like ours thr ough space. Earth cannot be the only place in all the universes upon which is life. And if time be -- then it must stretch backward as well as forward into infinitude Well, in all illimitabl e time, no ship from any other world has cast anchor upon ours, no argosy has sailed between the stars bearing tidings that life is elsewhere\" - The Face in the Abyss The serpent-woman of The Face in The Abyss has identified a problem: none return to tell us .. or do they? Is the soul a thing which moves through the centuries unchanged? Is my own an ancient Priest of Set from that first Temple in the dust th at was Khem?

The thought of saying that"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"I have the final answer strikes me as presumpt uous and I refuse to pont ificate. Nonetheless, there are intuitive thoughts which are marked in their refusal to be done away with. If past Magi have carefully chosen their words in the realm of immorta lity, I can do no less. The Magus Aleister Crowley cl aimed to be a reincarnation of the XXVI Dynasty Priest, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, an Understandin g he arrived at from Magical Workings dealing with the Stele of Revealing. He may have been guilty to a certain degree of becoming intoxicated, as Huxley described it, with the idea, and yet he does not make an issue of the exact how except indirectly by expounding his Word, Thelema, and thereby leaving th e door open for each man to cut his own way through the jungle of it all. He does make free use of references to past and future lives as evidenced by this quote: LIBER CMXIII . The Book of the Memory of the Path. Here are given two methods of acquiring the Magical Memory so as to enable the aspirant to calculate his True Orbit in eternity. The first method is to learn to think backwards till he acquires the power of recalling the events of his life in reverse chronological order. The id ea is to get back beyond one's birth to one's previous death, and so on for many liv es. It should then be easy to understand the general object of one's existence The second (eas ier and surer) method is to consider every event in one's past, determine the influence which each has had upon one's life, and by synthesizing these forces, calculate their resultan t; that is determine one's general direction so as to be able to concentrate one's energies on fulfilling the function for which one is fit. Character, conduct and circumstances are to be considered as terms of a complex dynamic equation. This method is of extreme value to all. It should be applied even to the education of children so as not to force them into unnatural developments. It is inherent in Thelema that the soul has no ri ght but to do its own Will. It is crucial to this theme of immortality that Thelema/Will be pr operly understood not to mean Will in the sense of a motivation for simple desire s, but rather as the true Thel emic meaning of acts being done with as full a knowledge of atte ndant implications as is possi ble in order that the desired course through the universes may be charted out in advance. Thelema by no means assures the Initiate that all and everything will be comf ort and roses -- no Word can do that -- but it does allow him to take an influential hand in the sequence of events which comprise life. If, as the early nineteenth centu ry philosopher J. G. Fichte thought , evil is in essence properly defined as the failure to develop an awarene ss consciousness, the Initi ates of the Aeon of HarWer walked fine and dangerous lines, as we now perceive them, between good and evil in their question, albeit with the greatest and best of intentions and with the firm belief in their own personal progress The strang e and fitful Lord of the Thelemites created enormous confusion among his followers and even the Magus of the Aeon himself completely missed the point in II-66 of the Book of The Law . The \"We are one; we are none\" statement is patently a promise not of conscious continua tion, but of cancellation. Mi sinterpreting it was an ill-fated error in the extreme, but if th e Magus himself failed to comprehend it correctly, the aspirants to the knowledge of the Book of the Law hardly could be blamed for treading the same path, unsound though it was in places. It is ironic indeed that the sophistication of the Book of The Law , the most up-to-date document of its day, should hold such pitfalls in its pages. In the XX A.S. commentary on the Book of The Law by Dr. Aquino [an Ipsissimus commenting on the works of a previous Magus], Thelema or Will is explained as an expression of mental separatene ss from Nuit, itself the doorway to immortality for the Initiate"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"who correctly comprehended Nuit as inertia a nd thereby avoided harmonization with that lifelessness. If, as Eliot Rose observed in A Razor for a Goat , it is true that \"to dabble in sorcery at all is to make a very imperious kind of demand on the unive rse,\" the Initiate who decides to continue his state of separateness from Nuit's inertia may be one of the most domineering forces in the universe. I also suspec t this may be the answer to exactly what that unforgivable sin against the third person of th e Holy Trinity, as spoken of in the Bible , must be: while the Magus who was Jesus openly used as a threat punishment to come for those who spoke against the Word of which he was the emb odiment, far more unforgivable in the eyes of the advocates of Inertia -- regardle ss of the name they attach to it -- is the rejection of it. It is therefore a sin which will be forgiven in \"neither this world nor the next\". When placed against the concept of remanifestat ion, that mental separateness is integral to continuation at the individual's discretion: insofa r as he Wills to continue to be apart from Nuit's lowest common denominator attraction, his personality or being or soul is free to explore, learn to Indulge, and to then utilize Coming Into Being. The soul is free because it is simultaneously doing something crucial to its ability to remain alive. It is partaking of the Principles it places in the aristos category. I believe it incorrect to think of the soul as making itself a part of a Principle in the sense of being absorbed within it in order for that soul to give itself the gift/option of eternal life. To do so would be simply another case of the \"We are one; we are none\" trap being sprung precisely beca use in the long run it would be not mental separateness but instead a complete harmonizatio n and a loss of awareness of the self. An understanding of the consequences of full attune ment is crucial to th e art and science of preserving mental singularity in tact. Although Magus Crowley and his Initiates felt strongly that a return of the soul in whatever shape/fo rm it chose was a viable concept, the stumbling block before them was the confusion and contra diction residing within the chapters of the Book of the Law . The inconsistency of the threefold book is maddening, and #II-22 is a prime example of this inability of its wording to walk a straight line. To the survivor went the prize of a strengthened self-awareness, but I suspec t such survivors would have been in the minority. [Or was it in fact a minority? Simple de sire may not be sufficient to stave off the magnetism of the natural universe, but the state of change bro ught about by the failure of metabolic processes could conceivably alter percep tions and priorities for the individual. \"The long habit of living...,\" you know.] And yet this is to be said for the Children of HarWer: if, as Renan felt [The Ordeal of Change , E. Hoffer], the purpose of an ideal social order is less to produce enlightened masses than uncommon peop le, the Magus of that Aeon succeeded in producing a new and singular race. The magic and mystery of HarWer's Aeon last ed from 1904 ce to 1966 ce when Anton LaVey came forth by night to establish the Age a nd Church of Satan, that splendid and wild Walpurgis which lasted until 1975. Dr. Aquino's book, The Church of Satan , chronicles the rise and fall of that institution in a detail which brings it to life. It is a work I would recommend to all Second Degree plus Initiates. The Word of the Age of Satan was Indulgence. When Understood in the highest of meanings the Word took Thelema several r ungs up the ladder in that it ga ve direction to the Word of HarWer. The Thelemite was told that he had a separate and distinct individual Will capable of making its own decisions on a scale far greater than it had previously comprehended. The Satanist enjoyed an access to the Lesser and Greater Black Magical world on a scale previously unknown in organizational history. Once he learned to stop kidding himself and realized that indeed \"self-deceit is the gravest of all sins,\" he presented himself with a license to do his own Will in a fashion which the Magus of the previous Aeon could never have"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"anticipated. It is ironic that w ith the key to the universe extende d in that one simple quote, and with the Satanic Magus expounding the Word furthe r yet, there were those who either never quite grasped the truth of it, or who preferred deception to reality. There are few places where the self is more prepar ed to accept soothing lies than in the area of avoiding that inevitable change which one day faces us all. \"It is my impression,\" wrote Eric Hoffer in The Ordeal of Change , \"that no one really likes the new. We are afraid of it. It is not only as Dostoyevsky put it, that 'taking a new st ep, uttering a new word is what people fear most.' Even in slight things the experience of the new is rare ly without some stirring of the foreboding.\" It remains ironic that many of Ma gus LaVey's Satanists, with the clue to understanding in their hands, continued with a fear of the eventual new yet to come. In the Book of Lucifer the question of life without a biol ogical body is addressed in Chapter X, Life After Death Through Fulfillment of the Ego . The Church's stand on immortality, through the mouth of its Magus, was this: Religionists have kept their followers in line by suppressing their egos. By making their followers feel inferior, the awesomeness of their god is insured. Satanism encourages its members to develop a good strong ego because it gives them the self-res pect necessary for a vital existence in this life. If a person has been vital throughout his life and has fought to the end for his earthly existence, it is this ego which will refuse to die even after the expiration of the flesh which housed it. Young children are to be admired for their driving enthusiasm for life. This is exemplified by the small child who refuses to go to bed when there is something exciting going on, and when once put to bed, will sneak do wn the stairs to peek through the curtain and watch. It is this child-like vitality that wi ll allow the Satanist to peek through the curtain of darkness and death and remain earthbound. Liberally placed all throughout the Book of Satan are statements atop statements dealing with preparing the self through accentuation of th e awareness with the being and for then emphasizing the acute presence of the self, both now and in the yet to come. The \"We are one; we are none\" confusion had been dispelled. Th e occasion for new discernments had arrived, and the method presented itself through the form ulations of Indulgence. \"Nasty, brutish, and short\" is the way Thomas Hobbes described lif e. The emergence from Plato's cave proves Hobbes to have been a candid and observant man, but it is far more beneficial in the long run to overcome (not ignore) those truths and be strengthened thereby. Anton LaVey apparently thought like Hobbes in that if we co mpare this quote in #IV-1 from the Book of Satan : Life is the great indulgence -- death, the great abstinence. Therefore, ma ke the most of life -- HERE AND NOW! with Hobbes' identification of a supreme evil , death, we begin to see the emergence of the tapestry of life rather than the placement of vain hopes in the pr otection of a celestial overseer. (Although Hobbes perhaps defines the id ea of a violent death suffered at the hands of an opponent in using the word evil, rath er than a natural death marked by \"peace.\") Mulford Q. Sibley quotes Hobbes as having said that We do not ... by nature seek society for its own sake, but that we may receive some honor or profit from it; these we desire primarily, that secondarily."},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"All this leads up to and reinforces the fact that Magus LaVey did not feel that it was necessary to round out one's life by partaking of the great abstinence. Neither did he feel reincarnation to have been the answer. \"If people were able to divorce themselves from the stigma attached to personal ego-fulfillment,\" he wrote, \"they woul d not need to play self-deceitful games such as belief in reincarnation as a means of satisfying their natural need for ego-fulfillment.\" Magus LaVey, like Ouspensky, understood that re incarnation, transmigration, karma, and all theories dealing with the survival of the Self were actually approaches to the relationships of the human soul to time. His method of passi ng this on was taught through an insistence on rejecting self-deceit. He knew perfectly well that reincarnation, karma, and the other theories needed to be viewed as symbols which hid deeper meanings behind their facades. He was himself also perfectly aware that in order to be seen as viable, both theories and symbols must conform to workable applications in the real world. [The abolishment of self-deceit starts on a basic level and then works its way upward -- as the expertise increases, so does the ability to create and utilize th e tools at hand.] The Satanic Bible does not devote a great deal of its time to reincarnation, having dismissed it as kheft, and neither does it discuss survival of the self in any great detail beyond advocating self-awareness over self-deception, and thereby more or less indirectly opening the door to survival techniques. I suspect the reason is th at Anton LaVey's philosophy and Word revolved around dealing with the here and now rather than a nebulous future. The Satanists of I through X A.S. were preparing themselves, unsuspectingl y or not, for a change of major proportions. That change took the unexpected form of th e Aeon of Set and the Book of Coming Forth by Night . Hegel, having advocated change through aw areness and consciousness, would have been perfectly at home in the Temple of Set. The emphasis on promoting the Temple within the self empowers the explora tion of a number of highly sophis ticated (and at the same time highly dangerous for the careless) techniques for allowing the Initiate to look at his own soul and decide what he wants to do ne xt. One frequent choice is that of simply returning to a state of self-deception. It does at fi rst seem a more or less attr active decision, depending on the individual's internal makeup at that point, but to those who select the less-traveled road go the rewards. It is not very often that magi cal societies direct th eir Initiates' atten tion toward acknowledging the separate presence of the self if the institut ion is not of the forum and questing type. It is better for the leader that their followers do not think for themselves, primarily because of the loss of financial backing and power, but even mo re to the point that the use of grey cells encourages comparison and analysis. In such a si tuation the coven leader is no better than his Christian counterpart. Hermann Hesse saw this in Siddhartha : Slowly the thinker went on his way and asked hi mself: What is it that you wanted to learn from teachings and teachers, and although they taught you much, what was it they could not teach you? And he thought: It was the Self, the character and nature of which I wished to learn. I wanted to rid myself of the Self, to c onquer it, but I could not conquer it, I could only deceive it, could only fly from it, could only hide from it. Truly, nothing in the world has occupied my thoughts as much as the Self, this riddle, that I live, that I am one and an separated and different from everybody else, th at I am Siddhartha; and about nothing in the world I know less than about myself, about Siddhartha."},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"The thinker, slowly going on his way, sudde nly stood still, grippe d by this thought, and another thought immediately arose from this one. It was: The reason why I do not know anything about myself, the reason why Siddhartha has remained alien and unknown to myself is due to one thing, to one single thing -- I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself. I was seeking Brahman, Atman, I wished to destroy myself, to get away from myself, in order to find in the unknown innermost, the nucleus of all things, Atman, life, the Divine, the Absolute. But by doing so, I lost myself on the way. Siddhartha looked up and around him, a smile cr ept over his face, and a strong feeling of awakening from a long dream spread right th rough his being. Immediately he walked on again, quickly, like a man w ho knows what he has to. Such reasonings and contemplations are the build ing blocks of the subjective universe, itself the holder of the lens through which the being perceives both the extens ive external cosmos and the complex internal microcosm. Determining that the inner universe does in fact exist discloses the presence of yet another integral challenge: having fixed the microcosm as an existing reality of its own, the In itiate must decide what is to be done next. \"Next\" begins as initial steps in doing Magic, and while those ex periments are satisfying as such, they do not immediately provide the answer. (Rather, such developmental work is instrumental in that it follows Hegel's basic approach of determining first a thesis and then an antithesis, with an eye on eventually establishing a synthesis which will be as error-free as is humanly possible. Such a methodical tool both can and should be used frequently.) Magicians are inquiring people -- not only do they want to know if a procedure works, but how and then why it does so. These constant dissections lead the way to far more complex works and Works which in turn open the door to the questions of endurance beyond th e physical. Our Setian literature is geared toward instruction and awareness, not toward ob literation of the self, wh ich is the path taken by the majority of mankind. The main point to hold in mind in being Setian is that the Gift of Set is there to be exalted, not to be used basely for simple situational manipulations. This exaltation need not simply be for the brief span of biological life. As the preface to Category 18 of the Crystal Tablet 's Reading List says, \"To the magician, life and death can be influenced and eventually controlled together.\" It is in this Aeon that we have the greatest access to learning those methods infl uencing the two inevitabilities. The main and initial focus of attention to Xe per was primarily on the Formula of the Aeon: XXX = XEPERA XEPER XEPERU = \"I Have Co me Into Being And Created That Which Has Come Into Being.\" This focus was the co rrect one, of course, si nce Coming Into Being was a new precept to be Understood and made concrete. As with all legitimate Words, comprehension of Xeper did not end with bei ng able to quote the Book of Coming Forth by Night . It began in earnest with that volume and then came to be. Setamorphosis was a Temple of Set term for the third stage of human evolution [III-9, Winter Solstice X, M. Aquino V]. Transl ating Setamorphosis as \"super(natural) transformation\" is not at all incorr ect. It is in fact another of th e keys to unlocking the doors to the continuation of life. We evolve as we go along, and the development leads ultimately to the manifestation of those transformations. It has taken 82 years for the pres ent Aeon to come into being, and we are the result of those years. We have reache d a high point, but not the highest yet. I pers onally feel that no \"highest\" point can be attained, since it would imply that everything else is either downhill"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"from that point on, or (equally undesirable) frozen in stasis. Continuing to examine thesis, antithesis, and synthesis is imperative to ongoing evolution and awareness. If we plan on taking full advantage of what Ka nt addressed as the imperishable life of the spirit, it is necessary to iden tify the working elements at hand. (There may be more truth than the first glance shows in the ol d belief that knowing the secret name of a devil gives power over it. The kernel within the ru le is that knowing the name of a thing makes it possible to put it in perspective through identifi cation. The previously unknown can then be dealt with.) P.D. Ouspensky named three categories re sident in the human being: First: THE BODY -- the region of instincts, and the inner \"instinctive\" consciousnesses of the different organs, parts of the body, and the entire organism. Second. THE SOUL -- consisting of sensations, perceptions, conceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires. Third: THE REGION OF THE UN KNOWN -- consciousness, will, and the one I, i.e., those things which in ordinary ma n are in potentiality only. I cannot find any points in the three categorie s Ouspensky identifies which appear to hold errors. The potential which he speaks of in th e third category is one of the Temple's primary areas of interest, since it goes hand in hand with the Word of the Aeon. The volume of theory available to us regardi ng not only immortality, bu t a broad spectrum of other subjects accompanying it, is massive. So me areas are immediately applicable to the subject at hand, while others ti e in later after furt her exploration -- the value of writings penned by the Orders are immeasurable not on ly in the long range view toward life beyond that first Ouspensky category, but more importan tly with an eye on esta blishing a firm basis for being able to extend life indefinitely. To the achievement of such a goal we turn our attention to a vast number of things, and it might be said that we multi-task. It is multi-tasking which builds that firm basis for an ever continuing Coming into Being. Through several of my own Workings aimed toward further defining the work I undertook as a Magister, it has appeared th at each of us builds a great House of the Being -- which is another way of saying that we build our Temples to Set and grow strong in the construction of them: \"(7)=[4] \", found in Vol. II, No. 7 of The Trail of the Serpent , describes such a Temple from a past Working: And then I lay in my bed and darkness grew ab out me. The world swam and I realized change had come about. There was, I knew, noth ing around me. No feeling, no sensation, no memory, no sadness or joy, just a cosmic not hing. A great Gate was there somewhere -- I knew that. Somehow, somewhere there was an escape route and how I found it cannot be explained. The Double Wanded One was there a nd I knew the years had passed. Fresh fever burned in me and I went forth to serve the new king. Yet part of me remains in the Great House and through my other self watches your Magick and life. Beware the cosmic nothing, Children of Set. You have only to awaken and enter the House you have prepared through your work on Earth. Looking back over the past and the present, you live in fortunate times and have greater Magicks in the yet to come. What our"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"Lord said unto us, I say unto you. Lift up thys elf! For there are none like unto you among men or among Gods! In those lines may be yet another of the major keys to immortality: the establishment of a location within the subjective universe so strong and well-defined that it defies the inertia of the natural universe. As \"(7)=[ 4]\" says, one need only awaken (=be aware) and enter the House prepared by dedication to the quest, itself the constant striving to Come into Being. A great deal becomes extremely clear once havi ng understood that. The Magus Crowley, when writing that each man should cut his own way through the jungle, was describing the path leading to awareness and what he expresse d as Thelema. When the Magus Anton LaVey wrote, \"Say unto thine own heart, 'I am mine own redeemer,'\" he plainly shouted from the rooftops not only the patent re jection of self-deceit and blind private subjectivism, but more subtly and just as importantly the emphasis on se lf- and then Self-awareness. It was for that reason that he later wrote th at the \"watchword of Satani sm is INDULGENCE instead of 'abstinence' ... but -- it is not 'compulsion.\" With the firm and acute presence of consciousness brought about by Indulgence, there is no way to avoid realizing why abstinence is spoken of as the Word of Sin: neither is it possible to misunderstand the necessity of the Satanic Word in one's life. In the same way, Set's own in structions in the Book of Coming Forth by Night to shun all recitation and not to offer affronts to th e Self become crystal clear. Like the genetics of Thelema and Indulgence, the coding of Xepe r can be fully employed only when the user cuts his personal path through the jungle. He ma y learn from the partic ular lens held by another, but his own thought must ultimately formulate itself into a workable base of operations most suitable for the building of a great House which not only stands in relation to a biological life, but in willful defiance to any destruction other than from within. If Set cannot remember the future, the chances ar e that others are also unable to do so. It is therefore impossible to predict future words with precision. It is possible to observe the current trends of the magics done by both Magici ans and non-Magicians, and then to divine in a particular way the futures in store for the yet to come. As long as there remains at least one workable organization dedicated to the excha nge of information and the pursuit of valid Words' meanings, there will be an emphasis on aw areness of the Self and the evasion of the cosmic nothing. With each succeeding Year and with each Word yet to arise, the main drive behind it all will be directed toward the quest for knowledge in order to continue gaining more knowledge. This is what the Aeon of HarW er knew as Work for Work's sake, and it is through that path we are able to take not only what fo rm(s) we wish through our determination to make change come about, but through which we are ab le first to build a strong house and then to remanifest it, as the motto of the Order of the Trapezoid says, in endless ways of existence in accordance with its own Will. The Self has but two options: it may Work and manifest itself that its activities may be car ried on, or it may fade into oblivion. The choice is its own. To Find a Pattern"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":" On January 4, XXII, the Priesthood of Set r eceived a letter dealing with the Word Remanifestation and the Degree of Magus, along with other observations and comments. The Priesthood was selected as the fi rst body to be spoken to, not in order to ignore the First and Second Degree Initiates, but to make my views and impressions on the Word available to them that they might more easily answer ques tions which would arise within the first two Temple of Set Grades. Now that the Priesthood has had exposure to the significances of the Word to date, it is appropriate that Second Degree members should have access to a paper dealing with the subject. (1) In order to understand and explor e the nuances of Remanifestati on to the full extent possible, a comprehension of what a Word is, along with a look at the Degree of Magus, is invaluable. Both subjects make for highly absorbing academic pursuits since neither occurs naturally, but they are linked together in being as a result of the direct intervention of and by Set himself. A Word, as the letter to the Pr iesthood pointed out, has curious rules and laws by which it comes about and operates. H.P. Lovecraft approach ed its principles through Dr. Armitage's explanation of thos e Things outside: It was -- well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our part of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itsel f by other laws than those of Nature. - The Dunwich Horror The way in which it \"acts and grows and shapes itself\" is completely unnatural. Although all conscious creatures are subject to its influence from the second it is Uttered, a Word is born from actions formed in the past, and actions which, through their pressu res, propel Initiates into a world which constantly changes. Th e continuing process of human evolution and mutation -- depending on trav eling up or down -- furthe r contribute to the diverse philosophical demands of life. Put another way, a ll things act both as a result of and on their environments, and necessarily produce new states of being as a consequence. Our attention is generally directed toward the outcomes of this rule on the mi nd of mankind, although in truth it covers all matter. A Word, being the product of events, cannot but effect them. A Word must have a speaker, a nd the Initiate who Utters it finds himself in an alien world. A Magus, wrote that prominent authority Aleister Crowley, is one chosen to proclaim a new truth to mankind. This is rarer than might be in itially imagined in worl d history -- to give you an idea, I am the twelfth Magus. A dozen in thou sands of years is not a very great number. No Fourth Degree is made a Fifth Degree for be ing a \"good Master,\" and neither should the Magus be thought of as a super-IV. The Grade of Magus is an unnatural Coming Into Being which has no place in the normal initiatory personal development. It is instead a state of being brought about through the direct intervention of Set for a definite reason. A Magus is brought forth in one of the two forms spoken of in One Star in Sight : the first kind of Magus \"utters a Classification: V2 - A17.3 - 2 Author: James Lewis V° Date: April 3, XXII HTML Revision: October 8, 1998 CE Subject:  Remanifestation  Reading List: 2H, 2M, 4A, 6D, 6K, 6N , 9C, 9D, 9K, 12C, 16A, 17A, 17D, 19G"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"Creative Magical Word, which transforms the pl anet on which he lives... This can take place only at an 'Equinox of the Gods' at the end of an 'Aeon'; that is, when the secret formula of its action becomes outworn and useless to furthe r development.\" The second kind of Magus is the one who makes \"personal pr ogress equivalent to\" an Aeonic Word. The Fifth Degree Initiate, therefore, is brought forth only when a Word is necessary -- that is, at a point in time when all the Forces involved have reached th e critical point at wh ich the current philosophy must be further defined. The difference between Xeper and my own Word is that the former fully instituted a new Aeon, while Remanifesta tion further clarifies the reigning Word. Our work and associations have taken us to the place in our development when not only must that clarification take place, but we must also do our part by becoming aware of the why and how of it all. When I first began working with what would even tually uncover such depths and secrets that it would be brought forth as a Word, the concep t was then without a name. Rather, it was a conviction that there was an answer to the questions provoked by a Working done by Dr. Aquino and myself in XIII. The main thorn in my side for years was Set's wording during that rite: \"See the Priest of mine you were in ol d Khem.\" I am generally quite skeptical when hearing claims made of past lives marked by the exotic. I grant that the soul that was Cleopatra, for example, might have survived, but hardly expect to find her occupying several contemporary bodies simultaneously. Such farfetch ed declarations begin as amusing and end as pathetic self-deceptions if th ey are not first abandoned in fa vor of other entertainments. I presume that the Lord of Darkness was not me rely pulling my leg through the mouth of his High Priest -- things would have been far easier for me personally had he been doing so -- and the Setian in me wanted very much to know how it was possible to have been a Priest of Set in old Khem and again now. It was the star t of a long search involving reading, stress, questioning, Ritual, and a lot of hard thought and work. The answer to that question, as originally co nceived, was oriented toward a long term event: How was it possible to survive the inevitable fa ilure of the biological envelope known as the body? Remanifestation answers that problem with what I consider a viable concept. To get a better fix on the workings of the Word, it is im perative that the seeker examine his priorities and place them in the proper perspective. Our prim ary aim as Setians is the utilization of the Word Xeper, to Come into Being, and two main questions emerge from that quest. First, what will we Xeper into, and secondly, how is it done? If we turn our attention toward that long term aim, the answers which I intuit are that assuming consistency, we Xeper into totally new beings capable of a vision beyond our contempor ary imagining. What my Understanding tells me is in essence as Plato put it, that the soul will then be quite by itself apart from the body, and that that state of pure reason and existen ce will allow even greater influences on reality. That answers \"what,\" insofar as our minds can l ook forward in time. It is the \"how\" that this state can/will come about which also occupies our minds, and is never far away from the practicing magician. To the mind of the Magus th is question has its answer in a six syllable Word: Remanifestation. Each day, each trial and error, each step is another rung upward on the ladder and results in revealing new facets of the being. No single thing in its present form is immortal, and each must change in some ma nner. As long as consciousness is present the choice is up to the organism -- it may choose to live or die, to Become something higher or sink to a lower and comfortable level. The latter is non-stre ssful, but short lived and those who opt for it may find themselves faced at the last by their individual Examiners and asked if it was well to put Majesty from them to win th e dust of earth. That we chart our own courses through life is something the Magus Aleist er Crowley Understood very well through the"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Word . In understanding the how and why of continuation it is well to apply oneself to the Word of HarWer. And yet one cannot sit about waiting for the gr and moment of transition from the physical known to the pure unknown. Remanifestation is hi ghly applicable in contemporary life also. The complete person of the Setian is highly in tricate, and with the exception of one single Degree is bounded by largely unexplored frontie rs within the self. The self-knowledge acquired as Coming Into Being c ontinues is unparalleled in the world outside the walls of the Temple in both its perception and depth – a nd repercussions. Recogni zing that there are repercussions is vital to understanding not only how, but also the why of the ongoing process of Xeper and Remanifestation. Comprehending the impacts of the interact ion of the self not only with itself, but also with the external world and its influences , is another key to knowledge -- itself a doorway to Freedom. Kenneth Grant talks about that self-gained right in this way: It is the role of the Royal or Kingly man that is extolled in AL ; \"the slaves that serve\" are \"the people,\" too lazy, too servile, too cowardly to realize their true heritage. This is why it is written: \"Ye are against the people, O my chosen!\" Xeper is an absolute freedom, but as with al l liberations, there are resulting responsibilities which cannot be ignored. In the case of this point in time and space which we have now reached, one of those major responsibilities is to ensure that those t ools and facets we make use of in the continuing process of Coming Into Being are highly refine d in their shapes and purposes. Each Word is a gateway for dealing with life an d its realities. When Al eister Crowley Uttered Thelema in I A.H., the Word was a sword forged by the Opposite Self to destroy the centuries of lies and misinterpretations which had gained a strong hold through the Word of Sin. The word \"Will\" itself was not a new combination of letters, but its philosophy was so unheard of in its impact that DCLXVI was to remark circa 1946 CE to John Symonds that \"As a matter of fact, the world was destroyed by fire in March 20, 1904.\" Symonds, apparently missing the crux of Crowley's pronouncement, could only repl y, \"But we are still here.\" Crowley was approaching the end of his current life and the Curs e of his Grade retained all its force even at that late date. As the Koran has it regarding what we now recognize as the Curse of the Magus, \"He looked around him, frowning and leering; then he turned away in scornful pride and said: 'This is no more than borrowed magic, the words of a mere mortal!'\" Each (9)=[2]/V faces the same attitude the Koran refers to, and which there se ems no way around. It is one of the penalties of the Grade. The new implicati ons of Will were far beyond the comprehension of most of its listeners because of the very newness itself. Is Thelema connected in any way with Remani festation? Each Word, and certainly those dating from , is related to its fellows through the highly sophistic ated sequence of Magical and philosophical progre ssion, themselves living symbols of the progress and state of mankind. With Thelema defined as Will, the Word cannot be seen as static; that is, it must have action and growth -- it can be seen th rough today's lens as having Remanifested each time the Thelemites studied and worked their Ma gicks. They may also be said to have Indulged and Xepered, along with having taken part in their own Xem (the eternal quest) as only vaguely guessed at in that day. If hindsight is said to have 20/20 vision, never it is more useful than when understanding history!"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"When Magus Anton LaVey Uttered Indulgence in I A.S., he placed the groundwork for the bridge between the old Aeon of HarWer and th e upcoming Aeon of Set. Like Thelema before it, Indulgence placed an emphasis on the acute presence of the individual existence of Will, and thereby asked more of its listeners than a brief space of attention. Doing away with comfortable and socially acceptabl e/demanded chains took a great d eal of courage, as did the awareness that it was possible to reach for what was previously considered unattainable. It asked that its followers examine, and although it was not put in that ex act Word, Remanifest that which they had Become up to that point as new beings endowed with the run of the world and themselves. Indulgence, like the Words before and after it, suffered from being misunderstood through translation into terms of the lowest co mmon denominator. Instead of Indulgence, many a listener heard \"compulsion\" and acted accordingly, and through so doing unwittingly brought confusion and misfortune on themselves. I tend to think the basic cause for such a great number of reverses is the desire to be entertained with lights and mirrors -- it is an ongoing search for kheft in whatever form that transitory compound might take. I have no respect for those who have seen too many movies and taken as gospel each evil morsel from Hollywood -- they seem to suffer from th e same kheft-thirst as their dilettante kin who go from one light and mirror show to anothe r. Those who make compulsion their god and driving philosophy will be governed by it. It is ir onic to see how close they come at times to truths far more profound and awesome than anythi ng an army of scriptwriters could conceive. The road to compulsion leads off to a land of not hing, and as such is not our concern except to understand and use as we will. Indulgence, looked at in Word seque nce to date, displays these links: Thelema (Will) -- the unique inner facet which makes man able to do th e impossible, first through the realization of its presence and then the utilizati on of it again and again. He works his Will that he might Indulge in the fine and goodly rather than be cont rolled by the lesser and base. He makes use of the combination of Will and Indulgence to come forth and Xeper as a being he could not have previously conceive d himself as being. His Will , made strong through Indulgence and Xeper , cannot simply emerge once and be done with it. The entire cycle repeats itself time and time again as the more sensitive and hi ghly functioning being ac ts on his objective and subjective worlds and is altere d in some greater or lesser way thereby. He cannot do other than Remanifest , or he will be flying using an older pr opeller driven craft. The airplane will still fly, but it cannot keep up with the supersonics speedi ng far, far ahead of it. Seeing the relationship of Xeper and Remanifestation is essentia l to a better understanding of both Words. Each of us knows Xeper to be a Coming Into Being, a coming forth by the night the soul has made and gathered about itself through its explorations into the black and unknown. That darkness in itself could be the subj ect of a volume of its own; the furnishings and occupants of it are made by both the self and forces external to it. The core being controlling within has the ultimate power of its combined universes: it can expand and accentuate them, or allow the potentials there to be drained in the search for kheft. As Initiates dedicated to searching out th e knowledge and understanding of the Prince of Darkness, we find our directions turned more toward the expl oration and control of th e darkness rather than simple anesthesia of the mind. When Set directed Xeper to be Uttered in X A.S., his intention was and remains that it should be a verb rath er than a mere noun. Xeper cannot and should not be thought of as a once-found and once-done goal! It is continuous, or at the least continual, examination of not only all that can be percei ved, but of that which may be suspected as having possible substance. It is Hegel's thesis, antithesis, and synthesis driven to a dynamic functioning that philosopher himsel f could never have foreseen. Remanifestation is inherent"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"in that process, since the three-part Hegeli an dissection and creation depends on making the new from the best of the old, or at le ast from the previous state of being. The Magus who Uttered the Word previous to my own was entrusted with expounding the Word Xem. Due to the events of that period, Xem is not studied in the same depth as Thelema, Indulgence, Xeper, and Remanifesta tion; it would help greatly were the Magus himself to be available to explain and teach the philosophy, but since he is not, we have to rely on the Understanding of the IV + to extract such viable info rmation as can be gotten from it. [Only a Magus can Understand better than a Master of the Temple the Works of another Magus and only the Magus who Utters a Word U nderstands it in its most complete form. An Ipsissimus also Understands, but as Aleister Crowley pointed out with an extremely precise sense of the wording, the Ipsissimus \"is be yond all this and beyond a ll comprehension of those of lower degree.\"] Xem itself can be summed up in three words: \"an eternal quest,\" a nd in those three are cosmos after cosmos awaiting the touch of the magician to bring life and bloom to the waiting soil. The current difficulty with Xem as a Word is that like all other Words, it depends greatly on the Magus who Uttered it fo r the expounding of its principl es and ongoing philosophies. [Go back to the previous para graph.] If a Magus happens to reject his charge, the Word cannot but also suffer. Xem still has merit of its own insofar as I personally am concerned, and indeed I cannot see my own Word being without the quality of immortality brought about through the search for greater tr easures via Remanifestation of the soul both on the mundane Earth and in the self-created universes where the quests take us coll ectively and individually. Let me repeat something a number of people have heard me say: No single contemporary object, being, or thought is immortal in its present form. There are no exceptions. And, as the High Priest has pointed out, there is no free lunch -- each in dividual, in order to continue living, must assess its current state and then Remanifest it at some cost to itself in one way or another. This is a fact which there is no evad ing, and it may as well be harnessed and made the best of. In the precise sense of Xem and Remanifestation, being \"made the best of\" is turning the inevitability of costs and paymen ts into stepping stones through the understanding of actions made strong through repeated Xepe ring on until the being should Will itself to Remanifest its essence no more -- if that is its desire. Xem, due to the events of XVII, acquired a sort of specter status. Having lived through that time and finding the Temple of today back on its feet and level-headed, I cannot feel or urge Xem to be discarded or denounced. The only tag I attach to the st udy of it is that such works as are uncovered regarding it should be translatable into English. Findings which are inexplicable in their mysticisms and which furthe r attempt to assert thei r right to exist through force and nebulosity are not worth the time of any Magician and ne ither should they be tolerated. Magic and philosophy come properl y under the category of Indulgence, not compulsion. While there is nothing wrong with any study of Xem, I would recommend the Adept doing so contact a memb er of the Priesthood of Set for guidance in the area. I remarked to the Priesthood in the letter of January 4 that ther e are a number of things I want to see result from this Word of which I am the Magus. I want to see Initiates of today and the future taking the Truths of it into account a nd growing thereby into be ings strong and great. I do not wish to see an enlighten ed society, but unique and extr aordinary individuals walking the Earth and using it in ways wise and wonderf ul. I will not see it all come about in my lifetime, but am content with the knowledge that the Word is a Truth and as such will have its"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"effect on the world and history. I want to see Initiates who con tinue to reach for the highest and best. Another thing I want to see is the best possible environment for the Word to exist and flower in. In order to do so it is crucia l that we reject the low and petty and the potentials for such happenings. Seeing Initiates reach for the opposite, the aristos , is necessary not only for my own Sense of Set being able to tell me all that affects me directly is well, but more importantly for the Temple of Set itself. What we strive for is what we become, and it is through striving for the highest th at we Become higher beings. [T he opposite is also true -- it is through striving for lower and ba ser states that opens the door to the risk of Remanifesting that which is sought -- base games.] In order to cultivate an atmosphere as close to the ideal as possible, I believe communication and dialogue to be essential. In my own case I am open to questions, comments, suggestions, and what have you regarding the Word. Isolat ing myself on a mountai n top may be tempting at times, but it is not the pr oper way of responding to the Task. I am a selfish man, by the way, and want time to devote to communication, to the penning of ar ticles for the Temple newsletters and Tablets , and for those Magick Without Tears -type correspondences with individual Initiates. I want Re manifestation to grow and flour ish not for the satisfaction of patting myself on the back, but in order to be truly obsolete in the way only a Magus can be and eventually pursue both those times of bei ng a private Setian and of Understanding newer concepts. The time is not yet here for the next V and I do not anticipate his or her presence at any time very soon. Nonetheless, the Magical Current of the Aeon continues, and another Word and Fifth Degree must arise eventually. After the Set-VII Conclave it seemed almost im possible that another Wo rd should be added to the Word Xeper, and yet the proper placement of it in the Formula nagged at my mind until I devoted time to it. The Formula of the Aeon of Set is XXX: XEPERA XEPER XEPERU -- \"I Have Come Into Being And Created That Wh ich Has Come Into Being.\" A Magus of the second kind cannot delete anythi ng from the Formula of the Aeon in which he emerges, but he can and does further interpret it. As Xeper re fers to the transformation and evolution of the Will from a human to a divine state of being though the deliberate, conscious, and individual force of mine, Remanifestation further expounds that Word and therefore affects the Formula. My Understanding of the Word, Set, and the Aeon tells me the Formula now reads: \"I Have Come Into Being And Created Through Remanife station That Which Has Come Into Being.\" Therefore, when I see letters e nded simply with \"Xeper\" instead of \"Xeper and Remanifest,\" the expression of the Formula and its summarize d Words the stand out as incomplete. Closing a letter with seven syllables may seem a bit draw n out, but it is the corr ect way to go about it - - perhaps Set will see fit to make the next Word shorter! Now you know more about this Word of the Year XXI and its Magus. There is neither a heaven of glory bright or a hell of burning punishment; instead the universe is open as yours to do with as you Will. Each of us ourselves mu st tread the Path -- Magi do but show the way. [There is] rest enough for the individual. Too mu ch and too soon, and we call it death. But for man no rest and no ending. He must go on, conquest beyond conquest. First this little planet and its winds and ways and then all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about him and at last out across the immensity to the stars. And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time, still he will be beginning. H.G.

The Æon-Enhancing Word Remanifest A Discussion of the Process of the Æon-enhancing Word, Remanifest. [Ipsissimus Lewis]: As is my wont with Orde r meetings and anything at all, my greatest natural enemy is a meeting that goes on forever, so I will not keep you here for eternity. We are going to be in and we are getting out. There was a saying in 30's or 40's of \"in like Flynn,\" which has a bit of an off-color connotation that I won't mention in mixed company, but this is what we are going to do. In the days prior to the U ttering of the Word, I was sitting down one evening reading Othello , and there leapt from the page the question, \"Who can control his fate?\" It is a rather profound question, and one that stayed with me for a good while. There were a number of influences which brought about the coming into being of th e Word. One of them wa s mainly a desire of mine to know what was next after Xeper. I re ally did not know how to phrase that question adequately to myself, or inte lligently enough to really even ask anyone else. It was one of those that stayed in the back of my mind and through a series of occurrences, I began to realize actions remanifest themselves in way or another. That seemed like a fine idea and a natural answer, or an unnatural answer, to th e questions that plagued me along with doing so to other people. I worked on it further, and it turned out that what the Word did was to enhance the reigning Word of the Æon, Xeper. One Comes into Being, one has attained a level of being, a state of action, a stage of being, and simply does not re main static. Something must happen with all this enormous energy that results from our act s of Initiation, an Initia tion that happens in a thousand ways. As you can tell from this Concla ve, even in your private conversations with Classification: V2 - A17.3 - 3 Author: James Lewis VI° Date: September 25, XXVIII -- Set-XIV (1) HTML Revision: Dec 19, 1998 CE Subject:  Remanifest  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"one another, even from sitting and joking, you can Initiate in this manner. You can Come further Into Being. Something must happens there must be an action and a reaction. As I define it and Understand it, our actions Rema nifest themselves and take us into the next stage as newly reborn beings. Mind, I'm not talkin g about being \"born again\" in the Christian sense. We all realize that. But notwithstandi ng, you have emerged as a new being, you are not that same person, you are not that same Initiate , you are not that same Adept that you were before. Everyone of you look about: At the begi nning of this Conclave when you arrived, regardless of what your Degree was, you did not know who was going to be here, what was going to be done, -- and we still don't know wh at's going to be done if you'll look at my schedule here. We do not know what is coming. We face it, we enjoy it We take advantage of this and we come out it and we are diffe rent people. We have changed. We have Remanifested ourselves. We look about at life. Life, as Anton LaVey said, is the great I ndulgence. This is why we are here. We have life. We have consciousness. We have the ability to interact, to move through this world of horrors even though the natural unive rse is against the idea. But I think we very successfully do so. The fact that we are all here from so many places proves the fact that we are quite successful in dealing with this world of horrors. We deal with that in the same way Hamlet did. Looking at the Ea rth, is it a sterile promontory? Is man really the quintessence of dust? Very possibly so : I know a good number of people I consider to be the quintesse nce of dust. There comes to mind from Cleopatra the quote, the exact wording of which escapes me: Wa s it worth the dust of earth to attain this prize? Cleopatra is on our Reading List. Man is not the quintessence of dust except by his own self-directing. Man will come into being one way or another. You do nothing, you can remain in stasis, and you will still come into being, but what is it you will come into being as? Practically nothing. If you direct this, if you push, if you force this, and in other words, In itiate, Coming Into Being takes on a slightly different nuance, that of Xepe r, which indicates evolution. At this point, you no longer have that rather negative quality of bei ng the quintessence of dust. The Earth is no longer a sterile promontor y for you. In other words, you have Come Into Being and you have Remanifested. You are arme d with these magnificent powers of self and you must do something with them. You have the en tire world of horrors there as your testing laboratory. There is a grand sequence in Magic and using Ma gical Words dating back to the year 1904 of the common era when Aleister Crowley Uttered the Word . The meaning is Will, the presence of Self. We we nt along until the year 1966 of the common era, and Anton LaVey began the Church of Satan and formulated and conceptualized all his visions and Understandings in the Word Indulgence. Indulgen ce was the denial of the great Abstinence. It was the determination to reach for that which wa s higher, better; in other words, not to get a bottle of Ripple, but the finest champagne. This was an Indulgence. Again, look around and in a thousand ways you can see Indulgence. It does not have to be necessarily some fine mystical concept. Xeper came into being. had been recognized, Indulg ence had been experienced, and the end result was that newly emerged pr esence of Self. This was the concept I was"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"working with, that of the newly emerged pres ence of Self. I began to understand that the newly emerged Self had to do something. It had to follow a process. It followed the process of Remanifestation, an action by which that newl y emerged being went forth into the world better armed against the slings and ar rows it was facing prior to that. Initially, I thought in terms of Remanifestation as a door of escaping obli vion at the end of the biological envelope's usefulness. As I have sa id to Order of Leviathan members time and time again, we are very life-oriented in the Temple of Set, and we enjoy our interactions. We live and we love and we fight with one another and we are here. One of these days, these bodies are going to give out. We do not know when, but it is dead ce rtain, pun intended, that we are going to find out one day. I had thought that to Remanifest would cover th e question of a post-mortem existence, of how we would survive the death of the body. It was my initial impr ession that what Remanifested, what lived, was the sheer energy, the essence, th e pure thought within And I really did not see any further than this at first. To me, it was a simple thing. I talked of Remanifestation, and I was trying to teach a way of surviving the biologi cal envelope. And then all these people also started working with the concept and people began writing to me with feedback, talking, agreeing, disagreeing even – stimulating thought, in other words. And suddenly I began to see the process of Remanifestation occurring in innumerable ways. For me, they literally cannot be numbered. Each person assesses the process, assesses the Word, and sees its relevance in his own light, just as Magister Menschel co uld come up with any number that I had never considered and vice-versa. We are both worki ng parallel paths, but we are both on the Left Hand Path. We have different pe rceptions, look through different le ns, and this is the beauty of it: when he and I have dialogue, we both l eave having learned from it. Again, this is another reason we have Conclaves. You can compare what you see through your lens and you can expound your field of vision, you can incr ease your depth perception along the way. In my notes I had said \"survival.\" Is it possi ble or impossible to survive, or do we not know? The answer is number three: we don't know. I w ould like to think that we could. I would like to say to you that the death of your body is not the end of your lif e. I think it is a very viable hypothesis, the only problem being that I cannot place it on a slide and I can't project it on a screen for you and say here is proof. What we have to do is work this out for ourselves. Again, in how many ways can we Remanifest ? Hundreds? Thousands? We must remember that each thing we do, each act, each single thing forces a re action of some kind. Aleister Crowley once wrote that one cannot drop a pin without its effects being felt throughout the universe. Quite frankly, the first time I read that I was sure he was proba bly on heroin at time, because that really did not make a lot of sense. Nowadays, it does. I know that if I consciously do an act, there is no way I cannot in some manner or another cause a ripple effect, or that I cannot touch on another person's life. Again picking on Magister Menschel, when we dialogue, and when he writes a paper and I say, hey, this was great, or I just didn't like that . No matter, we are stil l forcing a reaction. He is feeling what is within me. What is within him is still reacting and it comes back to me. I then Remanifest. I have learned a bit more. I have grown. I have added to my arsenal, not in a weapons sense that I am going to shoot him, but that we have added and increased our skills, we have enhanced our Xeper, that Coming Into Being and so again now when I read Aleister Crowley's words that if a pin is dropped the eff ects are felt in the entire cosmos, I know what he is talking about. He had a very viable point."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Of all of the people here, I would like to get a few examples of your impressions of what a Remanifestation is. [Priest Barrett]: There is a situation in wh ich substance A and substance B are brought together in an unnatural way to create an entity which is not the sum, but the thought of those two. [Ipsissimus Lewis:] Very good. You will note that he said these two come together to produce something that is unique. This is a very good definition. This is why some of the best definitions of the process of Remanifestation do not come from me, they come from other people. I have a limited attenti on span, as we all do. If I can draw on the attention span and the understanding of someone else, my own is sharpened up. That was extremely good, Priest Barrett. I had not looked at it from an alchemical or a chemical sense. [The next comment from the floor too faint to transcribe, although it dealt with perspective.] [Ipsissimus Lewis:] Perspective does indeed assi st Remanifestation. If you can't look at what is before you, you do not know how to use the forces there at hand. [Adept Osborne:] On a personal level, I apply it as a form of transf orming myself from one level into another state of being th rough Initiation progressing upwards. [Ipsissimus Lewis:] This is true . You must have the muscles involved to climb up that ladder. You can't really put one foot on the bottom r ung and assume you are going to reach the top. This is another interesting as pect, that we grow in our Ma gical and Initiatory powers by flexing magical muscles. The more we do, the more we are able to do. The more we put into a given amount of research, the more we get back from it. [Adept Parivarto:] Imagine being at the beach at the ocean. The waves are at your toes and you follow one wave in and it crashes and is no more. You look out, and yet there is another wave. It is a different wave, but still the ocean, as this wave comes in. The ocean remanifested that way, and there are big swells that will b ecome waves; you know it will crash and return to that ocean. Even further out in the ocean, it will become a wave and is going to yet again return at another time as more waves. [Ipsissimus Lewis:] An interes ting aspect, your mentioning the waves, and I see exactly the analogy you are drawing there. On a more subtle level, when the wave crashes it alters the beach front and small subtle changes take place that might not be evident for years yet to come. And yet, things are remanifesting very subtly beneath the surf ace that will once again come forth in an even greater remanifesta tion one day. Admittedly, if you have beach front property you don't want it to remanifest back in the ocean. There is good and bad with it. Remanifestation is like Black Magi c. It is neither good nor evil. It is a tool there to be used. For all you Star Wars people out there, of wh ich I am one along with being a Doctor Who person, it is very similar to the Force. The Force was not a good thing, the Force was not an evil thing. The Force was a thing there to be us ed, and as Hamlet says , there is nothing good nor bad, but thinking makes it so. The use to wh ich you put the powers that will Remanifest within you, the abilities, are ne ither right nor wrong, but your own thinking will make them so."},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"[Name missed:] On your comment on how the waves change the beach, can one's personal Remanifestation actually be complete without a state of active change, not only within himself, but in his surroundings? [Ipsissimus Lewis:] I don't think the process is ever 100% complete exce pt in the sense of completing the small things, as in the case of each wave crashing creating a change. It may be so subtle that we cannot perceive it and that we will not percei ve it until a later point in time when it has reached such a quantity and quality that it becomes obvious to our senses. I believe that any conscious move you make, any w illful Black Magical act, is going to effect a change or, hearkening back to Aleister Crowle y dropping a pin and affecting the entire cosmic level. [Adept Willey:] I have always found that if Coming Into Being is Xepering and Remanifestation is next, it is al most as if you have to say one with the other and that they have dual meanings, although I don't have it a ll thought it all out ye t. I had thought of Remanifestation as a life-action, and hadn't thought of it as dea ling with death. As we come into a new being or a new degree, then we Rema nifest that being by seeking out every aspect of it, everything that we can find out about that le vel of being, and that is what I have seen of the idea of Remanifestation. [Dr. Aquino:] Can I say something from the Xe per side of the house? As it was originally developed before the Word Remanifest was Utte red, Xeper was a sort of a single concept that described the evolutionary unfol ding of the self into itself as a continuing ongoing facet of which there is no concept of an apex reached, as a sort of trun cated pyramid, I suppose, of the self that keeps standing that way. When the Word Remanifest was Uttered, what it tended to do at least for me was this: There is a paradox inherent in Xeper which Remanifest tended to resolve, at least from my point of view, and I feel ther e are two opposing forces here. Identity and change. On one hand, Xeper seeks to maximize your identity. On the other hand, it is a pr ocess of change and as you change, your identity is changing. So at once the Word Xeper is suggesting you should remain the same person and indeed become more strongly and firmly that same person; on the other hand, it is suggesting that there is an evolutionary su rge upward and forward in which you have become a different person. Remani festation to me suggests a resolution. First of all, it takes this paradox which was an unspoken paradox at the time of Xeper and by virtue of this Utterance of this Word, it makes the paradox concrete . It says to be involved in this process of Xeper, an actual event or seque nce of events, or an unfolding of events takes place, and these events are a form of Remanifest ation of the Self such that the identity is retained and indeed affirmed and tempered, but it goes through a so rt of a series of regenerations, I suppose, like our good friend Doctor Who, who remained the same person, but different. The concept of Remanifestation as it has unfolded throughout the last 99 and plus one issues of the Trail of the Serpent provide a kind of move ment of how you are going to both change and remain the same in a sense. And so it addresses, in the best Ipsissimal fashion, the resolution of a paradox in the way that does not attemp t to roll back on one. That, at least, is the way I see fr om my side of the room. [Ipsissimus Lewis:] Being of an Æon-enhancin g Magus, I cannot disagree with him. Let me point out from a technical aspect , if you have read Crowley's One Star in Sight , he goes into all the Initiatory degrees and he also covers two kinds of Magi . There is an Æon-instituting"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"Magus, of which Dr. Aquino is one, and ther e is an Æon-enhancing Magus whose work comes about and it is equivalent in depth to th at of the Æon-instituting Magus. And one of the rules of the Æon-enhancing Magus is that he work s to support, to reinforce, to make stronger, the Æon in which he is living and there is no way under those rules that the Æon-enhancing Magus can ever conflict with the Æon-institutin g Magus. This is why I say I am not going to disagree with him. For another reason, he is perfectly correct. Number two, the rules by which we operate says that I see exactly what he is saying. [Name missed:] Hearing this, it suddenly da wned on me how much you encompass the Word and exactly what Dr. Aquino was talking about in terms of Xepe r being the identity or the core and Remanifestation being the change and the strengthening of that force and that is what you have done with the Word you have Uttered. [Magister Robinson:] An element of Remanifest I am going to touch upon is very important to my own process being of death. It is the initiatory inertia. There is a point of process in which you simply get to a point of burnout and all ki nds of stuff that happen where there is a blockage. All these terms are inherent within the initiatory process within Temple. Something happens that you just can't go any further being who you are and what you are with the baggage that you've got and the knowledge you have. A change occurs, a transformation occurs, Setamorphosis occurs, and at that po int in time something else has Remanifested. There is this rebirth, this resurgence of a search for the gift of Set that occurs which is more powerful than it was before. Something new, you seek a different way of creating a different paradigm. You get a different point of view that then allows you to move onward or inward, whichever progression you happen to be followi ng. I found nothing that really says that as clearly as that one Word and this whole proc ess because I think the Æon's enhancing or an Æonic Word really has to be process-orie nted, to encapsulate a thousand different experiences, of every experience within the Temple and if it accomplishes that that's the test, the thing that makes it what it is. [Ipsissimus Lewis:] It is no doubt a test by fire for the Magu s as he sends his Word out because people are going to look at it and want to use it. They will want to optimize it. It is a test of the Word as these laboratory scientists, which we all are, pick up the Word and put the process through the fire, and they are the ones who judge whether it works. Is it viable? As you said, it is a very process-oriented thing. It is a very active thing. I see your point also that there does come a time when all of a sudden yo u have reached a level and have simply gotten stopped temporarily and must reorganize and reconfigure and then come forth again. [Priest Barrett:] Perhaps I can ask a question re lated to Remanifestation in a similar way. I understand that as the Magus of Remanifestation you are in some sense an aspect of Remanifestation embodied. What is your relationship, howev er, as a Sixth Degree to Remanifestation? [Ipsissimus Lewis:] Just briefl y, I would use in the same mann er I believe that Dr. Aquino would use Xeper, because the Task of the Ipsi ssimus differs somewhat with that of a Magus. It is more a transæonic thing, the Sixth Degree, whereas in Fifth Degree you are working with one certain Æon and one certain Word. It branches out later on for you, certainly. [Dr Aquino:] As they mentioned in the Order of the Trapezoid meeting earlier, after another 24 hours without sleep, it will sound even that much wiser."},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"[Ipsissimus Lewis:] Right, we'll sound terribly profound tomorrow. [Adept Parivarto:] What of cognitive identity? [Dr Aquino:] As with many terms, there are ma ny shades to the answer . But it really comes down to almost a central premise of self-consciou s existence that, if in fact you are aware of yourself as something distinct fr om anything else, then that stat e of awareness is an awareness of identity. In other words, awareness that you are not blended into other th ings, that there is a place where the essential you stops and the rest of the universe commences. Now, that's the easy interpretation. It becomes more difficult because the behavioralists will pounce on this and say that it is very hard fo r you to actually be aware of yourself, but many of the things that you use to define yourself are in effect your physical extremities or your regular senses bouncing off other things and cr eating a sort of illusion of self. There are people such as Dr. Lilly with his experiments in sensory depr ivation who have tried to find out where a person ends and other things begin by blocking off the sense of feeling by putting in a sensory deprivation tank experience, for example, and finding that without a constant inflow of external stimuli from the natural uni verse, the mind eventually becomes incoherent, almost as if your brain is being scra mbled. You become sort of psychotic. Descartes' approach to the issue went at it not in terms of sensory deprivation tanks, but in terms of trying to eliminate impressions that we have from the senses and saying that we will deny that my eyes or ears are giving me the corre ct information. He found that if he denied all the sensory input coming into his consciousness, there was very little th at he could rely on by which he could prove that something called Des cartes existed. The result was his very famous statement Cogito, ergo sum, I think, therefore I am, saying that even if his thoughts were completely scrambled, the fact that there was something there having t hose thoughts at all, no matter how incoherent they might be, demonstrat ed his identity, or his actual being. And from that premise we then postulate that we could in fact rely on the senses and that there were no external political forces such as gods or an ac tive force of nature that were deceiving him. He therefore began to write upon such being th e case and therefore he felt that he had demonstrated his identity, as shaky as it might be, for something that was still there. These are these approaches, the mind, the scien tific, and the logical. We now enter a world with quantum mechanics where even these sorts of explanations are subject to that much more investigation because of many of the things that we feel that we perceive with our senses may not be there at all. When you see the red sweater he re, is in fact this material red? Or, is it in fact composed of fibers that are actually ever y other color of the spectrum besides red such that when the light hits it, everything is absorb ed except red, which is reflected into your eyes and so you see red. So in fact, we live in almost an inverted kind of universe of eyesight in terms of color in that sense and therefore these notions of a quest and an approach to a concept of such as Xeper and Remanifestation, wh ile they seem somewhat sloganistic at first bite, are very subtle concepts. They are very subtle aphorisms that are still in the exploratory stage, a nd if we jump too fast towards pat conclusions or pat definitions, then we will get in trouble. We have to approach these things a step at the time here and a step at a time there, and th en I would say through a combination of logic or science and ultimately as a kind of noetic insight, as a true Magician we will always require it. We will come to a pproach the truth. Now, aren't you sorry you asked me about it?"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"[Adept Parivarto:] I'm glad you spoke and th at's why in slowing down that process, approaching the concept of Xeper and Remanifest ation is a complicated process to understand what that really is about and asking who am I. This has a criti cal meaning, that of asking who and what am I, and this Xepering and Remani festing, and what is it going to become and change and transform and stay the same, and what is it th at is doing that? [Dr Aquino:] In my philosophy courses, I used to tell the joke about the college professor who lectured his class incessantly on Descartes, causi ng a student to worry about this all evening and finally, at 4 a.m., called the professor and sa id, \"I can't stand it any longer, professor I've got to know. Do I exist?\" The professor ya wns and says, \"And who wants to know?\" [Ipsissimus Lewis:] That was the crucial point: who wants to know? Our time is getting away from us here. I have time for one more question. [Priest Severson:] It seems as if with all the definitions and people's perceptions of Remanifestation, it seems that part of the importan ce of that is the actual realization itself of the change. The change that comes about come s with a realization of what has happened coming with someone else having it as well. [Ipsissimus Lewis:] I don't think it is a single act, that of Remanifesting, because again, it impacts on so many other areas of our lives . Repeating a prime example: attending a Conclave. We cannot simply meet one pers on or any number of people and have those meetings mean or do one single thing to our si ngular selves only. It permeates your entire being, all this Magical in teraction with one another. I think this is a good example of the fact that there are innumerable ways that the effects of this Word, and in fact, the two Words work together. There is a very pleasant and nice effect of Remanifesting. I always remembered it in this special way after hearing it on one of the ep isodes of Patrick Troughton, Doctor Who number two. Asked why he was a renegade on the run from his own people, the Timelords, he explained that there is an whole galaxy out there to explore, millions of planets, aeons of time, and countless civilizations to meet. And then, there was the fact that he did tend to get involved. That is Initiates of th e Temple of Set. we have our galaxies and we do tend to get involved. And speaking of time, that quality and quantit y has crept upon us. I would like to thank you for your attendance at this meeting. I have learned from it and hope you have as well. Footnotes 1. With thanks to Priest Van Patten for the audio transcript The Prime Directive"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":" The prime directive of the Order of Leviathan is to Xeper and Remanifest . - The Rules of Claw Section 16 of the \"Rules of Claw \" is applicable not only to the Order of Leviathan, but to all areas of the Temple of Set. I know of no other Order which states it in those exact words, but the rule is there, notwi thstanding. The directive also stands to reason; why enter the gateways of the Temple if planning to do otherwise? People enter for various reasons and always time is the test of the aspirant. The directive has special meaning for the O.L. Initiate. It is the same plan followed by all Setians, to be sure, but with a somewhat more sp ecialized slant. The Order is here to explore the avenues of immortality for the self, and it does so by accentuating an awareness of the self, its workings, and potential. The Initiate of the Order is told that as best as can be found from educated guesses and objective experience, he or she is alone in a mindless universe which is not favorable ground for any thing or ent ity resolving to operate independently of it. The task is not impossible, but it is a complex one. Other Orders of the Temple are aimed in parallel directions, whether their Grand Mast ers word their goals as such or not. The difference is in the manner of tr eading the Path and through what lens it is perceived. OS, OS, OTR, OV, OM, OOS, OP, OA, OB, ON, or O.L. -- the prime directive is in essence the same and the Orders' sages do but teach it in divers wordings. Is it possible to teach immortality? As Adana said in The Face in the Abyss , none return to point the way: \"Compassionate men, lighteners of burdens, prelates of pity -- why have they not reappeared crying, 'There is no death!' Ther e has come no word from them. Why are they silent?\" Certainly physical immo rtality is not an option of today's world, and thank goodness for it -- can you imagine some of the less pleasant of your acqua intances living eternally? The Dark Lord forbid! The best we can do is pool our intellectual resources, extract a set of best possible hypotheses/answers and then go from ther e. One thing is dead certain: an inevitable day will come when each of us will have an opp ortunity to put our theories and knowledge to the test in no uncertain terms. What is it to Xeper? It is to Come Into Being, to emerge from that cave Plato spoke of and see reality not as dancing shadows, but solid images full of color, warmth, and determination (or a lack thereof.) Expect no physical changes such as brush-like ears or an elongated curving nose. You can reasonably expect to grow ol der and eventually undergo conventional somatic deteriorations, but the Temple of Set has no di rect influence on normal biological changes. What is it to Remanifest? It is first to have Come Into Be ing and secondly to have taken action against the sea of troubles surrounding us a ll. And indeed, action is necessary since the Classification: V2 - A17.36 - 1 Author: James Lewis IV° Date:  January  XXVIII  Publication: The Trail of the Serpent HTML Revision: Dec 19, 1998 CE Subject:  Purpose,  Xeper  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Cosmos views as presumptuous those who make the effort to rise above a lowest common denominator status.

As such, it can be seen as the ke y to the question of immortality, that which can be shown to the soul, but not taught to the hands. The banners of the king of Hell go forth, Virgil said to Dante as they paused to look upon Judecca, the dwelling place of Satan. Rather than being fixed in an icy center of the earth like the punished and punishing Inferno Satan, our banne rs go forth into the world and the cosmos. Whether those banners bear the figure of Leviat han or the device of a nother Order -- or of no Order, the fact of their presen ce is evidence of the prime directive: to Come Into Being and bring forth into the world a new reality which will immediately begin to exert its influence on the old world that it might bring about furthe r change. The ongoing proc ess can be stopped at any point by the Initiate causing it, but at his own risk. [H.P.L. recommended none be called up that could not be put down again.

None drinking deeply of its consecrated waters could want to choose the stagnant murky pools of the idle mind. Remanifestation I remember my initial confusion and concern as a Second Degree Adept when Xem was Uttered. \"A new word? How does this affect Xe per? How does this affect me?\" Some of you probably have similar concerns about Remanifest ation. I hope to answer those concerns, and to give you directions in which you can xeper. Let me begin my briefly reviewing aeonic history... The modern magical era began with the Aeon of HarWer (1) in 1904 with the Utterance of Thelema . Crowley brought forth the knowledge that ma gick comes from the Self, and that the Self is responsible for its own destiny. To be a magician, exercise your Will.

While the world in general demonstrated increased energy and will, and while cultures and nations worked towards self-determination, (2) few individuals could understand the Message, and fewer still c ould follow its dictates. Although Set does \"not wish to think of [the years of the Aeon of HarWer] save as curiosities,\" (3) we Setians can learn many lessons from this period, as shown by the many books in section 9 of the Crystal Tablet of Set reading list. In 1966, Anton LaVey ushered in the Ag e of Satan with the Utterance of Indulgence . Not only were we to exercise our Will, we learned that we could and should revel in magick, in life. We are the centers of our universes. The more we recognize and willfully indulge in this knowledge, the stronger we become. Again, wh ile the world in ge neral demonstrated increased freedom and self-indulgence, few c ould understand the Message, and fewer still could follow its dictates. The Aeon of Set began in 1975 (year X A.S.), with the Utterance of Xeper . The magical ages of inertia and stasis are past, and War has been declared agai nst the forces of inertia and stasis. No longer will we bow to the dictates of moment um and of mindless change (Atu X, for those interested in the Tarot), but instead we become the instruments and the directors of Change, of Xeper (Atu VII can sometimes be interpreted this way (4) ). As Setians, each and every one of us has enlisted in this War. We battle not as an army, but as individuals, and as a loose a ssociation of freedom fighters. We fight to control our own destiny, and to Become more than the mindl ess universe would otherwise have us be. The world shows increasing change, but few can understand the Message, and fewer still can follow its dictates. Like me, you have accepted this Challenge and Quest; like me, you strive for Xeper. In XIV (1979 C.E.), a new magus arose and Uttered the Word Xem . Xeper is a process, and activity, and Xem can be considered to be a goal or result of that process. Xem is that State of Being towards which we strive. Xem is al so the Quest for that State of Being. Magus Barrett felt that Xem is such an exal ted state that only those who had achieved a certain closeness to Set, only those whom Set had recognized as Priest, could even benefit from its study. Accordingly, materials discus sing Xem in depth were sent only to the Priesthood. That magus is no longer with us. The primary texts concerning Xem (5) are scheduled for inclusion in the Ruby Tablet of Set . While Xem is now 'available' to Adepts (6) , most of you will find its importance minimal. Further, the text is shrouded with symbology from the Aeon of HarWer and other mystical traditions. Like finding a magical name or worki ng with an individual neter, a time may come when Xem is important to you. Until then, concentrate on Xeper."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Per-t was Uttered in XVI. At first recognized as a Word, many in the Priesthood now consider Per-t to be little more than a us eful philosophy. My personal opinions concerning Per-t are still in flux. The magus of Per-t considered the philosophy to be so exalted that even the Priesthood had little chance of benefiting significantly from its study. There are very few formal writings concerning Per-t available. One such essay is scheduled for the Ruby Tablet . (7) Now Magus James Lewis, Chairman of the Council of Nine, has Uttered Remanifestation . Remanifestation resembles Xeper in several ve ry important ways. I will mention only the most obvious similarities, leaving ot hers to interested students: • Remanifestation occurs and a pplies at many different levels . We see evidence of xeper in the objective universe, and we can see ev idence of remanifestation there. There are other levels which apply only to Setians, and additional levels which apply only to advanced initiates. • Like Xeper, Remanifestation has immediate meaning and im portance to all Setians, of all degree levels. Remanifestat ion is a tool you can use now to further and solidify your Xeper. • Like Xeper, Remanifestation can be app lied immediately to all of our personal activities, mundane as well as within the realm of the Temple of Set. Manifestation n 1a: the act, process, or an instan ce of manifesting. b: something that manifests. c: one of the forms in which an individual is manifested. Manifest vt to make evident or certain by showing or displaying. (8) Simply, Remanifestation is the repeated demonstration of Xepera Xeper Xeperu , of what you Are and have Become by your own Ef forts. And, Remanifestation is not an option. Every action and decision is witnessed, an d makes evident what you are. So what are you? What do you demonstrate? Hold yourself as a xepering Adept Black Magician, show yourself as a xepering Adept Black Magician, Remanifest yourself as a xepering Adept Black Magician, and you will BE a xepering Adept Black Magician. Allow yourself to remanifest as a creature of habit, and that is what you'll be. At the level we're talking about here, neither stat e is absolute nor permanent. One day of stasis behavior does not a Setian unmake. Nor does one day of intensive study and ritual reveal you to be an Adept. Repeated activity at any leve l reveals and/or develops your level of being. The promise of Remanifestation is that you can change your level of being, by changing the level of your activity! Magus Lewis (9) credits Magistra Wendall with the stat ement that \"the constant state and process of Xeper can neither be contained nor ignored. It must evidence its presence in a way unmistakable first to the Initiate and eventually to the percepts of others .\" Your level of being will be known by your remanifestations.

Remanifestation: A Symbolic Synthesis Symbols can be used to store and tran smit information, as examined by Her-Bak and Symbol and the Symbolique (2L and 2V). Symbols can also be used to extract intuitive knowledge, knowledge which rises not from th e subject under study, but which ri ses from within the Self. Once this latter type of study has been comple ted, the symbols can be used as reminders of that knowledge, simplifying and speeding the repeated study and transmittal of that knowledge. This is such a study. This essay examin es various symbols within the Word Remanifestation , symbols defined by the student during the study, rather than any placed there by the Magus. The first part of this study examines the va rious pieces of the Word and the dictionary definitions of those pieces. The second part of this study uses Numerology its symbolic tool.

You must Rema nifest, evidence, be, one level of being, before you can even hope to begin to Re manifest the next highe r level of being. Most Adepts, at some time during their growt h, want to become Prie sts. It is extremely rare for any Adept to become Priest while wanting to do so. Instead, we eventually start enjoying being Adept so much that the dream of Priesthood gets shoved aside, almost forgotten. And it's usually in the latt er state, when we ar e willfully indulging in the Xeper of an Adept, flexing our magica l muscles, exploring what we can of the magical realm, that Set taps us on the shoulder... Many of us are effectively dragged into the Priesthood. We like being Adept. It takes some maturity within this new leve l before we Realize that as Priest we are still Adept as well -- the two are not c ontradictory states, but can be held and Remanifest simultaneously, for they operate in different realms. Xeper, Becoming, requires Being. This is pa rt of the message of Remanifestation. Concentrate on your Being, on Remanifestat ion of that Being, on Xeper within that level of being, and you will find yourself prepared for the next level of being. Numerology can also be used in a symbolic synthesis. I suggest that those unfamiliar with Numerology read A View of Numerology in Volume X, No. 1 of The Scroll of Set , and an introduction to Numerology such as that found in Richard Cavendish's The Black Arts (#4C). REMANIFESTATION = 18 + 5 + 13 + 1 + 14 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 19 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 9 + 15 + 14 = 169 = 16 = 7. 169 = 13 2 . 16 = 2 4 = 4 2 . 169 can be split horizontally into 16 9 = 2 4 3 2 , and into 1 69 = 1 13x3. Note the great abundance of prime numbe rs and powers of prime numbers. While smaller primes and squares of primes (s uch as 25, 36, and 49) aren't too difficult to find in day to day Numerology, squares of larger number s, especially larger pr imes, are quite rare. This rarity points to the uniqueness and im portance of the Word and its lessons. The importance is also indicated by the preval ence of powers in the above analysis. 169 = 13 2 , 13x13. Thirteen is rarely analyzed in Numerology, usua lly being translated to 4 (=2 2 ). But because Remanifestation = 169 = 13 2 , let us look at 13. Thirteen is the age of bar mitzvah, the age at which a Jewish boy becomes a Man, a modern example of a very ancient trad ition. Thirteen is often the ag e of the onset of male puberty. Thirteen is the first 'teen' year. These are all examples of xeper, (forms of na tural and automatic xeper, rather than Xeper willfully directed by the individu al). They lead to remanifest ation, for puberty, teenageness, and manhood are states of being that repeatedly evidence themselves in the individual. These examples deal with the mundane universe, as 13 = 4. It's only when we reduce 169 to its final sum, 7, that we find the magical root of the word."},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"Note that 7 is not only the number of magic, but of cycles. Remanifestation as a means and as evidence of Xeper is cyclic. Be ing an Adept is not a constant , level state of being, but one which cycles from the (near) mundane to some fairly rarefied states of Being. In Ouspensky's terms, (4) few of us are able to be Awake and Awa re all the time. We each have achieved 'average' levels of Awareness and Being, a nd we tend to cycle upwards and downwards around this level. The challenge of Xeper and of Remanifestation is to cycle higher and higher, to sink not quite as low as we did before, and to maybe th is time climb a little higher than before. Having looked at Remanifestation's numbers as a whole (169), let's look at Remanifestation's consonants and vowels. The consonants can indicate outward a nd usually mundane characteristics, while the vowels can indi cate inward, subtle, and more mystical characteristics. Consonants: RMNFSTTN = 18 + 13 + 14 + 6 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 14 = 124 = 7; 124 = 31 x 4=2 2 . 31 = 4. Note that the messages of 169 are re peated here, with the total sum being 7, and with 124 being the product of a large prime (31) and a power (2 2 ). Note that 31 is 13 reversed, both equal to 4. Vowels: EAIEAIO = 5 + 1 + 9 + 5 + 1 + 9 + 15 = 45 = 9; 45 = 5 x 9=3 2 . The sum, 9, is the number of mystery and mysticism. This tells us that there is much about Remanifestation that is still hidden. We now know a lo t about Remanifestation from th is study, and we are all able to Work with Remanifestation from this knowledge. But there is much yet to learn. Xeper. Footnotes 1.

Yet for all that, it is a Word, and like all the Words th at have come before, it has little meaning to anyone unless the one who hears it finds a respon se within Self, a res ponse that leaves one forever changed. Otherwise the Word, like so many fertile seeds, is just blowing in the wind. Wrestling with concepts as profound as Xeper and Remanifest is an indi cation that the Setian has at least let the Seeds of the Aeon take root . When it is the desire and will of the Adept however, that the Words of the Aeon become personal expressions, then the process of internalization or \"owning\" has begun, and those seeds not only ta ke root but grow. Internalization of any concept i nvolves an identification with th e elements of that concept. \"Identification\" is the process of attitude change that removes the sense of \"separate\" from that which is perceived. This can happen at any number of levels. For example one can observe the five-year-old gi rl dressed up in her Mom's heels and scarves, telling smiling observers that she is Mommy. She of course realizes she really isn't, but no one presses the point so as to ru in the fun of her fantasy. In this role-playing, the child is comparing her identity as child with that of Mo mmy as she sees it. This helps her put herself into perspective as she then plays with her dolls , or with other siblings as if they were the child. As she grows older, assuming a continui ng presence of Mom as role model, the young girl will go through a number of ot her stages that again \"try on\" some of the characteristics of Mom. Eventually her acceptance or rejection of motherhood itself will be based on all the role play that has come before, and on the positive or negative feedback she received. She will, throughout the rest of her life, re fer back to her image of Mom to form her own self image. Whatever she sees of herself as female will be shaped by those memories, as will all the roles she assumes whether Mom ever did those or not. Now the question: What are the elements of Rema nifest? As the whole subj ect of this Word is still being discussed, I will offer my perceptions of it. I see the Words, the processes, of Xeper and Remanifest as identifying cyclical passage s. \"Cyclical\" here means that there is an internal process that one re peats as time goes on and situ ations change, providing more opportunities for growth. \"Passages\" means there is a stepping into another dimension or level of awareness that builds on what has gone before, in the sense that one's past shapes by assimilation or rejection. Passages occur successfully when there is a conscious effort to take charge of change that occurs in spite of oneself. Passages occur from a Self-directed desire for change that may or may not coincide with significant life changes. Perhaps following an example that might have some parallels to a hypothetical Setian's Xeper might help demonstrate what I mean: Xeper starts with the mental assessment of possibl e changes -- fantasy: \"How would I act if I really believed ...?\" \"How woul d people respond to me if they knew...? What changes could occur that might be irreversible ? How much am I willing to risk to find out? How might I feel about myself if these things happen?\" Subject:  Remanifestation  Published: Trail of the Serpent - Jan.

V'YN'KHE ROHZ: The Cycle of Nine In past issues of Runes both I and the G.M.E. Michael Aquino have written on the meanings of the Nine Angles. One aspect of the whole seal remained unexplained. How does the Ring or Circle of Nature ( physis ) around the Nine Angles relate to the entirety of the interior Nine A ngles? This is important to know from a magical standpoint because it may hold a key for effective interactions between the subj ective and objective universes. On the day of the recent Temple-wide simulta neous Working (7/18/XXVII), I again turned my Attention to the seal of Nine Angles, or the Seal of RUNA as it is called when the Ring is Classification: V2 - A17.4S - 1 Author: Stephen E.

Only later would I learn that much of the impetus behind the Working was Sir Dennis Mann's ongoing exploration of the link between Chaos and Order. I hope this Work bears some relationship to that exploration. In previous articles on the subject I have es tablished a location on the Seal for each of the Nine Angles, and have placed the numerical id entity upon each one. The us e of this sign as a Gateway between dimensions and as a device for the visualizing of thi ngs that shall become manifest in the Is-To-Be have also been alluded to. The schematic summation of our Work thus far appears: The Angles and their Key-Words The point of origin for most speculation on the Seal of the Nine Angles is based on the text of the Ceremony of the Nine Angles by Michael Aquino and publis hed in Anton LaVey's Satanic Rituals . If we examine the texts which accompany each of the Nine Angles, it is not hard to derive from them certain 'key words' which su m up the meaning a particular Angle has in the cosmology. The First Angle describes Chaos -- which \"is the infinite.\" In the ancient Greek arithmosophy the One had many of the same connotations as our use of the value Zero has. If the One is everything, then it is nothing at the same time. The Second Angle is by contrast Order -- there \"is the master w ho doth order the planes and angles.\" Here duality comes into being and order becomes possible. The Third Angle speaks of Understanding -- wherein the \"power to behold the master of the World of Horrors\" is given, as is \"substance of being and the knowledge of the Nine Angles.\" The Fourth Angle involves temporal Being -- the self is brought in to being and the threefold perception of time as past-prese nt-future is brought forth. The Fifth Angle is that of Creation -- as \"the hornless ones ... raise the temple of the five trihedrons unto the Daemons of creation...\" At this Angle the Trapezoid enters the Pentagram and Creation takes place."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"The Sixth Angle describes Death or Sleep -- it \"is the sleep of the Daemons in symmetry...\" Here balance to the point of stasis is obtained in preparat ion for further, more powerful transformation. The Seventh Angle demonstrates Birth or Awakening -- it \"is the ruin of symmetry and th e awakening of the Daemons...\" Here the stasis of the sixth Angle is overcome by the imbalance and asymmetry of the Seventh. The Eighth Angle manifests Re-Creation -- as \"the Masters of the Realm ... raise the temple of the eight trihedrons unto the Daemons of creation....\" Creation is raised another octave. The Ninth Angle is Perfection or Rebirth -- more technically perhaps it is the Black Flame , i.e.: \"the flame of the beginning and ending of dimensions, which blazet h in brilliance and darkness unto the glory of desire.\" If these key-words, along with the original enumeration of the Angl es, are applied to the diagram of the Seal of the Order, the following image emerges: It should be noted that the Nine Angles as thus far discussed are in reality not entirely linear in the way they are manifested. In fact what we really have is a non-li near manifestation of the Angles as pure qualities not really a series of numbers in a linear, counting, sense. But it cannot be denied that on another level, there is true meaning in ordering the numbers of the Angles one through nine. This sequence is not th e order in which we usually experience the effects of the Nine Angles, however. The Outer Ring As noted elsewhere, the Third and Fourth Angles may be seen to intersect with the Circle of Nature surrounding the Nine-Angled Seal. These are the direct Gateways between the world of the psyche -- the Will -- and the realm of Nature. It is through these Gateways ( Understanding and Being ) that the Will most easily affects th e flow of natural events in the linear time/space continuum, The linear flow of the time/space continuum in which we live -- this world or complex of three dimensions -- is the meaning of the Ring surrounding the whole of the Nine Angles. The Inner Ring Previously undiscussed is the inner Ring of Nature -- the ring which"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"touches the five points of the Pentagram. This circle defines the physical body of the individual. The five points of th e Pentagram touching the Circle signify the five bodily senses -- as Gateways to higher being. But Gateways can be closed or misunderstood and act as easily (actually more easily) as blockages ra ther than conduits. This Ring remains unshown, Hidden, in the Seal of RUNA. I have here reproduced the Sigil of Baphomet as used by the Church of Satan alongside the simplified Seal showing both Rings in place. By using these Signs as guideposts, the Initiate can comprehend the distinctions between the ps ycho-cosmologies of the Church of Satan and Temple of Set/Order of the Trapezoid. Historically, I might also note that the name of the Hebrew demon Leviathan (LVYThN) surrounding the space between the two Circles is significant. It is a five-lettered name, and so refers to the inner Ring. The Ophite (Serpentine) Gnostics knew well this symbolism behind Leviathan -- whom they identified with the Greek ouroboros the world-serpent which bites its own tail surrounding th e inner cosmos. (See also the Norse Midhgardhsormr [= Midgard's Worm] or Jormungandr [= Great Magical Staff].) Levi athan separates the temporal cosmos of the Earth and the spheres of the se ven planets from the Realm of the Fixed Stars and the Realms of Being beyond. The serpent gu ards the passage between the realms of change and flux and the realm of being. (See Kurt Rudolph, Gnosis [San Francisco: Harper and Row 1987], pp. 67-70.) Leviathan, or the Ou roboros, is the inner Ring of the Seal -- whose number of Angles is not in reality five but seven. Herein is Hidden a great Secret. The pure form of the Pentagram suspended within the Circle of the obj ective universe is the purest expression of the Temple of Set philosophy -- it points to the ultimate goal of Initiation upon the Left-Hand Path. But at the same it conceals much -- which can be revealed by delving into the Darkness between the lines. The Angles through Chronological Time As noted above, the Nine Angles as thus far di scussed do not directly re flect the manifestation of their qualities in temporal existence, i.e.: in the munda ne space/time continuum. But as magicians we remain highly interested in this mundane world, seeking methods to enable us to influence events within it. The Circles hold the keys to this kind of manifestation. The outer Circle describes the cycles of Nature, the unf olding of events outside the self and in the objective universe. This is wh ere we perceive chronological, linear time and witness the chains of cause and effect. If, following logic previously established, we begin and end at the Ninth Angle and lay the nine points of the Angles in a counter clock-wi se direction around the out er Circle where they would most directly affect events in the Circle (note they only twice intersect the Circle itself) we arrive at the following image: Here is a totally new ordering of the Angles -- with the exception of the Ninth Angle, of course, which always returns to itself and is the 'beginning and ending of dimensions.' This second ordering is the way in which we experi ence the effects of the Nine Angles in our temporal lives. So it is the key to the use of the Seal in influenci ng events in this world of five"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"senses and three dimensions. The 'inner ordering' is non-natural, transcendent, oscillating and non-linear, while the 'outer ordering' is natura l, temporal, cyclical and linear. The 'inner ordering' always returns to the same eternal quali ty, while the 'outer orde ring' cannot return to the same place twice. The 'inner ordering' always affects and gives shape to the events coming about in the 'outer ordering.' Imagine yourself as the subject of a journey around the Circle. Notice the 'story' told by the key words as arranged on the outer circle: (1) Being has its Hidden origin in Perfection and precedes (2) Birth or Awakening . Essence precedes existence. At the Second Temporal Angle Birth takes place -- an idea is born, or some new st ate is awakened. Afte r some while, a state of (3) Chaos is entered in which Infinity is glimpsed. There can be no true (4) Creation without the state of Chaos being first entered into. From that state comes basic (5) Order ( Cosmos ). It is from this basic order that a (6) Recreation can be brought about. These states of Creation and Recreation follow naturally fr om the states of Chaos and Order which precipitate them. Then comes (7) Death or Sleep in which the subject of this cyclical journey must necessarily undergo a transformation. Beyond this is (8) Knowledge or Understanding -- as the subject reaches a stage of Perfection as the object of that Knowledge becomes the Black Flame. Then, if it is so willed, Rebirth may occur. This descrip tion is worded as if the journey undertaken were that of In itiation in a life-span -- but in reality this Circle represents any cyclical development. Each 'rebirth' is an entry upon the next cycle at a higher 'octave' of the scale implied by the Circle. The relative distances between the points on the Circle are also important. They show a kind of rhythm in the cycl es of manifestation. In a conversation with Sir Ronald Barrett, he ac curately asked the ques tion, since we have two qualities (or vectors) here, what is the angle between them a nd at what point do they come together. He knew the answer, of course, becaus e the answer is almost always Hidden in an accurate question. The two vectors forming the Great Angle between the qualities of the Seal and the Circle are what are referred to in the ritual text of Die Elektrischen Vorspiele (and in the tale by Frank Belknap Long, The Hounds of Tindalos ) as 'angled space' and 'curved space.' Both are governed by the Law of Nine, but each have very different qualities. Th e Black Magician will seek to master both 'angled' (non-natural) and 'curved' (natural) dimensions. The Hidden 'third force' at the point where th e two vectors come toge ther is the precise configuration of the Seal of RUNA itself. No other shape or juxtaposition of lines and curves could conceal and convey its mystery more perfectly or simply. It is mysterious and projects a sense of impenetrable Darkness -- yet paradoxical ly contains all the keys necessary to the unlocking of its own mystery. And so it is with every true Rune. It se als out the unworthy and seals in the Secret upon the Heart of every Knight or Dame who has partaken of its essence. Those who are without move only in curv ed space, i.e.: in the mundane space/time continuum. But those with the power to penetrate the veil and go beyond the Barrier can move in angled space, i.e. the Real ms of the Nine Angles. The Angles have power over the Rings, just as consciousness can ha ve dominion over nature."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"The Seal contains three separate types of figures: the Pentagram, the Trapezoid, and the Ring(s), two angled and two curved. Each of these three figures are important and unique elements in the complex all are needed to convey the information and no one of them can serve in the stead of an other. The Pentagram is the Sign of the Five -- of Hu man Consciousness which is a reflection of the Principle of Isolate Intelligence, called by the Name Set. The Trapezoid, which is the Sign of the Four, is the Link between the Worlds. Note that there could be construed two Trapezoids, one contained within the Inner Circle and defined by the four upper points of the Pentagram. This would be the Link between the body and c onsciousness, while the other and principal Trapezoid is that which is extended to the B oundary of the objective universe -- and which acts as the Link between the psyche of the indi vidual and the objective universe. Finally there are the Circles. The Outer Circle is that of the objective universe, while th e Inner Circle is that of the carnal body of the individual. The Seal in Operation As always we must ask: What use is all this either to my Initiation or to my ability to effectively interact with my environment? Th ere are many practical us es already discovered for the Seal, and I trust there will be many more discovered by those who will use it. First it is a unique, entirely Left-Hand Path, cosmology untai nted by Judeo-Christian contaminant lore. But intrinsically it is a map of Initiatory development and the development of anything along cyclical or oscillating patterns. Such maps ar e extremely important to true Initiation. Without them the would-be initiate may wander aimlessly for Aeons. It furthermore provides a plan far magical timing. By using the way in which the inne r ordering of the Angl es interact with the outer ordering, it becomes clear which acts of Will must be undertaken when to assure the best chance of magical success. The non-linear Angles must be or dered to create the virtual necessity of linear (temporal/natural) devel opments in accordance with the Will of the Trapezoidal Initiate. It will be noted that th e further away in temporal time a prospective event is, the easier it will be to affect. Re member, you are not limited to changing the Is-To- Be. What about changing past events to necessa rily modulate events in the Here-and-Now and in the Is-To-Be? Although this contribution may seem to some to be a detailed indulgence in cosmological game-playing, others will remark that it is bu t a brief and sketchy outline of a much more profound and intricate elucidation of the magical cosmos. The latter group will explore further and to them will be shown the Hidden keys necessa ry to their own uses of the Seal, There is much Work yet to be done with this Sign. As always I would suggest that most of your e xperimentation with the Seal be concentrated on operative experimentation as an instrument of verification for any speculative conclusion you may have reached. This will help us avoi d Neo-Cabalistic mumbo-jumbo -- which is always a danger when dealing with questions of magical cosmology. Also, when and if such practical experiments are carried out, report the results to the Order.

The Symbolic \"When humans are unable to guide their actio ns by ordinary percepti ons they resort to mathematical ideas.\" - Denny. What is the source of the pow er of a geometric symbol? From prehistoric times, the most intelligen t among humanity recognized the power of geometric symbolism. The old proverb, \"a pi cture worth a thousand words\", simplifies the situation greatly. For evolutionary reasons th e neurological equipment of human beings is biased heavily towards the interp retation of spatial information and of motion in space. (Think of a monkey leaping through the treetops.) Human speech grew out of the need to communi cate both emotional states and information in the most compact form possible. Speech is a potent tool, yet it is poorly suited by itself for certain types of information nor is it the onl y expression of the human capacity to abstract. The use of pictures keyed to oral explanati on and experience to signify processes involving visualization and complex coordination would ha ve been one of the ear liest discoveries of humanity, and one ideally suited to the transm ission of secret knowledge: prediction of future celestial and earthly events, architectural desi gns and procedures, and all sorts of process- description. Unlike phonetic writing, which discloses its message to a nyone who can recognize the relationship between glyph and sound, the abstra ct pictograph or glyph guards its content, disclosing it only to one who ha s access to initiated explanati on OR one whose native talents, intuition and experience are sufficient to recognize the reality which gave birth to the symbol. Mathematical notation stands somewhere be tween these two realms, being in theory accessible to all. Denny has argued that abstraction of this kind is useless to humans who do not change their environment - what we w ould call natural humans - and points to the differences in level of articulation of basi c geometric and arithmetic concepts between hunting-band societies, trading cultures a nd members of industrial societies. Yet at all times individuals existed who sought to comprehend and command the world through dealings with unseen powers, and who in this regard stood apart from the rest of their culture. It is this elite which formulates its understanding as esoteric diagrams. Let it be observed that there is nothing mystical about this matter; it is the antithesis of mysticism. However fraught with error the beli efs of a priesthood or guild might have been, the original power of the group lay in the grasp of some extr emely practical secret unknown to the masses, concealed in their symbols - this is what Massey dubs \"t he physical nature of the Gnosis\". An uninitiated person perceiving what lay behind the symbolism had to be"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"brought into that cult as one de serving of its prerogatives, or else silenced to protect the secret. Before proceeding to discussion of the Seal itself I mention two mo re facets of visual abstraction that may be important. The first concerns perspectiv e and aspective repr esentation. The Egypt ologist Heinrich Schaefer has demonstrated, in comparing Greek and Egyptian representati onal art, that their treatment of space and content proceeds fr om fundamentally different assumptions. Perspective representation enta ils a set of conscious ideas about space and point-of-view which are neither obvious nor necessary. \"Primitiv e\" art the world over, and the drawings of children and most persons unfamiliar with art, ar e indifferent to perspective. In aspective representation, position and size pert ain to meaning rather than vi sual appearance. While this may take crude forms, such as is found in dr awings where the size of a person indicates their importance rather than their height, aspectiv e representation may conceal some information from those unfamiliar with the graphical convent ions involved. When interpreting a geometric emblem both systems of representation must be kept in mind. Finally, neurological factors may be important in perceiving the meaning and intent of geometric and mathematical symbolism. While a general cross-sensory mapping of spatial orientation takes place in the thalamus, an anci ent part of the brain, discrimination of angles and construction of perspective fr om visual cues takes place in the cerebral cortex. There is medical and practical evidence that visualizat ion is subject to hemi spheric lateralization, being one of the strengths of the \" nonverbal\" hemisphere of the brain. It is possible that prolonged active contempla tion of abstract geometric forms causes unusual patterns of brain activity and f acilitates changes in consciousne ss. (See H.P. Lovecraft's short story \"The Dream in the Witchhouse\".) This po wer to change consciou sness through passive contemplation has traditionally been ascribed to the abstract mandalas and yantras of Asia, and it is certainly a belief im plicit in Western sacred geomet ry. Neurological signs of such effects could conceivably be detected via EEG testing but to my knowledge this has not yet been attempted. The Form of the Hidden The trapezoid superimposed on the non-natural Pentagram and resting on the circle of the natural order forms a conceptual bridge betw een these distinct realms. This suggested a spatial reinterpretation of the figure before me : the circle occupying one plane, the pentagram another, and the trapezoid forming a path betwee n those planes. The Seal then appeared as a projection onto the page of a pathway between planes. Having realized this, I questioned my perception of the Seal. For if this was a perspective sketch, what were the true forms involved? Here it is appropriate to mention some little -known mathematical facts about \"occult\" insignia. Writers on the history and philosophy of math ematics state that the Pythagoreans did not extend the concept of dimensionality beyond soli d geometry, and that the idea of higher dimensions could not take hold until the rise of analytic geometry in Europe centuries later. I"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"can find no evidence to fault this view. Yet I find it singularly suspicious that the Pentagram, the badge of the Pythagorean brotherhood, is not only a key to the golden ratio but a two- dimensional projection of the interior vertices of the pentahedroid or hypertetrahedron, the simplest possible four-dimensional figure. Nor is this the only \"occult\" symbol of hyperd imensional aspect. Denning and Phillips have documented the appearance of the ogdoadic star in Renaissance art a nd identified it with a hermetic tradition. Whether this be true or no, they have described a modern occult group making use of this symbol. It is easy to co mpare the ogdoadic star with a two-dimensional perspective view of a tesseract, or hypercube, and see that the ogdoadic star is a tracing of the interior vertices of this figure. Equally curious, from a mathemagical perspect ive, is the fact that another conventional perspective representati on of the hypercube shows this: six cubes are distorted in ordinary space to appear as truncated pyramids bridging the \"ana\" and \"kat a\" cubes of the hypercube [shown at the right]. (\"Ana/kata\" are the polarities that Rudy Rucker uses to refer to direction along a fourth spatial axis perp endicular to the thr ee of our normal experience, \"up/down\", \"right/left\" and \"near/far\".)"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":" Returning to consideration of th e Seal, then - the possibility exists that this form is a representation of a dimensional gate bridging the natural order and the non-natural realm of consciousness. The trapezoid is the keystone of this gate, having the traditional form of the keystone of an arch, being mutually defined by the ring of nature in size and by the non- natural, hyperdimensional pentagram in essential form. The threshold of this portal is formed by the points of contact with the natural order. As I have remarked, a geometric figure, especial ly a unicursal figure, may describe a process. Time is frequently treated as the fourth dimens ion of our experience. To this interpretation of the Seal I now turn. The Tracing of the Nine Angles During correspondence on this topic, Sir Setnakt dr ew my attention to the Pythagorean aspect of the Bond of the Nine Angles ; the notes of the Grand Master Emeritus on the Seal of Nine treat this Pythagorean symbolism in detail. A brief summary follows. The Bond of the Nine Angles distinguishes the fi rst four angles associated with the Trapezoid from the subsequent five angles of the Pentagra m. The first four angles are closely identified with Lovecraftian Neters, or Forms, establishing the f undamental character of our consciousness: Azathoth's chaos, the dualis tic and dimensional or dering defined by Yog- Sothoth, Nyarlathotep's message of consci ousness and the endurance of Shub-Niggurath who defines temporal perspective. The connecti on between these concepts and Pythagorean numerical philosophy - the point, th e line, the triangle and the solid tetrahedron - is evident. These latter powers - se lf-consciousness and temporal pers pective - have triggered an unfolding of various non-natural historical even ts: the raising of the Pyramids under the rule of initiatory schools and the slee p, \"not dead but dreaming\", of those schools during the rule of an aggressive and imperial monotheis m. With the Aeon of Horus (and with the Theosophical \"New Age\" introdu ced at the same time - note that the Yin/Yang logo lacks all angularity, yet poses a subtle challenge to symmetry) these initia tory schools have \"awakened\" and in our time have brought forth Masters. It is not w ithout interest that it is the third and fourth angle, those of self-conscious ness and temporal perspe ctive, which touch the ring of the natural order in the Se al of Runa prior to launching these temporal manifestations."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"The Seal of Runa may thus embody a description of the relationship of these Neters or Forms in an inner, creative realm, a nd the temporal unfolding of their potential in the outer realms defined via contact with the na tural order. That's a macrocosmic interpretation. Microcosmic interpretations involve applic ation of the Neters or asso ciated Pythagorean ideas for structuring the manifestation of concepts in th e World of Horrors. Thus the phrase, \"casting a vision through the angles\". Here is a simple example. Social change starts with the status quo, a f unction of mindlessness. Participants are blind to their contribution to a situation, indeed cannot perceive the situation, being embedded in it. This is the \"Idiot God\" st age. Since it is only possible to discriminate any stimulus by observing a difference, the fi rst step in awareness comes when somebody observes a case where custom isn't observed, yet the sky doesn't fall and the spirits don't smite the heretic. Once deidentification takes place, it is possible to distinguish necessity from custom, and the newly aware individual can \"b ehold the master of the Worl d of Horrors\", tracing out the process by which the custom arose. Finally, the one who makes change - the one who triggers the evolutionary War in Heaven - is the Luciferic spirit w ho goes hither and yon 'raising consciousness' (\"the Ram of the Sun, who brought thy selves to be\") and slicing the timeless perpetuity of the status quo into \"the time that wa s, the time that is, and the time that shall be\". At this point, a concept has been launched from inner planes into the World of Horrors, from dream into action. What of the process of manife station associated with the fi ve angles of the Pentagram? Wilson and Shea, in the trilogy Illuminatus, avow that a fivefold treatment of historical process is the guarded se cret of the Illuminati , and put forth a tongue-in-cheek exposition of this theory. I mention this to alert the reader to the possibility that we are engaged an exercise illustrative of Wilson's Law of Fives, the principle that all events and processes can be related to the number five given enough ingenuity. On th e other hand I find it curious that Sun Tzu's analysis of warfare - now hawked in bookstores as a tract applicab le to business - begins with strategic assessment of five fact ors critical to success, and that the product development cycle used by one large corporation is divided into five phases. More relevant, perhaps, are mathemagical hints found in patterns of natural growth: phyllotaxis, the shell of the nautilus, the hor n of the ram. These are examples of gnomonic expansion, a proportioned growth peculiar to lif e, resulting in inva riance of form. Living beings alone produce forms of pentagonal symme try. The Hidden includes secrets about the fashion in which the will-to-live has taken ta ngible form. Do these secrets apply to the trajectory the magician must consider as the vi sion is cast through the wi ddershins spin of the Nine Angles? People speak of an idea having a life of its ow n, but can we find any formalization of this concept that will serve us in understanding and predicting the spread of ideas? The psychohistory of Hari Seldon is not here yet; it may well be asked if such a thing is possible. Forecasting is more an art than a science, ev en though new tools and theories are constantly being invented and explored. Evolutionary biologists have wr itten of \"memes\" - constellati ons of ideas and beliefs whose propagation and development seem analogous to th at of parasitic and symbiotic life forms - and students of organizational be havior have begun to consider broad-spectrum theories of"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"interaction that span biological systems, computer systems, a nd market transactions. Whether these strange cross-disciplinary efforts will develop into revolutionary scientific fields of practical application, as cyberne tics did, remains to be seen. What we seek is not so much the ability to forecast the future as the ability to identify natura l-order constraints and inertial factors that influence th e trajectory of change. The Door Late in the work on this essay I \"stepped back\" from the Seal of Runa and tried to look at it once again with a fresh perspec tive. I noticed the simple elem ents: the geometric star, the trapezoid, and the circle. I recalled the image in 2001 , the rising of the sun over the black monolith - which, from the perspective of the vi ewer, was a trapezoidal form - and a further thought occurred to me. I thought of the Daemons of Creation in the Bond of the Nine Angles, and recalled that the Egyptians used the same word, sba , for three ideas: star, door, teach. This is not the place to delve into a treatment of astro-archeology. But we who speak of the Powers of Darkness should not forget that H.P. Lovecraft was an amateur astronomer as well as a dreamer, that the ceremony in which the Bo nd of the Nine Angles is recited was to be illuminated by controlled moonlight or starlight, and that the King's Chamber of the Temple of the Five Trihedrons was lit by channels admi tting the light of certain stars. The Grand Master has spoken of the magnetic pull of the ring of Nature that draw s the Self through the Nine Angles; the sense of exaltation the Elect fe el under the light of the stars is the expression of that hunger for the Unknown as it is evoked by Nature in its immensity. While this paper takes an intellectual approach, the intellectual pursuit of the suprarational is met with due response from the Hidden realms of the psyche. When I checked my diary I noticed that the first mention of my study of the Seal was dated precisely eighteen days prior to the Transformation Working of June 18-19t h: I had fallen asleep after computing the angular measures and experienced dream s about the past and the future. During the Transformation Working itself I fr amed the momentum set up by the conscious trajectory of my life - the choices made while awake - as the force behind the launch of a specific idea. My notes on process under \"The Tracing of the Nine Angl es\" were the result of this focus on manifestation of will . There can be no final conclusion. I have put forth a few of my t houghts and speculations concerning the Seal of Runa and the secrets c oncealed in its geometric form. Any widening of the perimeter of the Known must entail a propor tional increase in th e scope of the Unknown, yet this inquiry expands and enhances the Self rather than diminishing it before the Hidden. Thus the motto of that perpetual Quest as the Magus of Runa has formulated it: Reyn 'til Runa. Bibliography Aquino, Michael A. Commentary on the Seal of the Nine Angles , RUNES , vol.

Second, an extended \"reverbe ration\" or \"echoing\" of the focus of this Working within the Walhalla, culm inating in its sending-forth into the material world. The central features of the various principal o ccultisms of the 19th and 20th centuries C.E. ran through my consciousness almost as a pageant. I understood the object of this to be an exposure of contrasts, inaccuracies, and inconsis tencies -- a vast, spiraling dialectic designed to clear away the debris of sectarianism and s uperficiality in the search for the key principles of the true Powers of Darkness. Concepts of \"will\", \"intelligence\", \"self-cons ciousness\", \"initiation\", and \"magic\" appeared in turn and fell aside as well; I saw them as useful, but still, surprisingly, peripheral to the central concept being approached. When at last all veils had been removed, and that concept was revealed, it was so simple as to seem at first anticlimactic a nd almost disappointing. It was: the phenomenon of life. Instantly I regretted my impa tience and arrogance, my lapse into easy disappointment. Too many doors had been opened, too many forces un locked and unleashed for this to be the ultimate impact of the Working. Then it was as though a \"test\" were passed: The basic concept of \"life\" became a sort of focal point, like that of a refractor telescope, through which the energies of the Working passed. The initial \"dialectic\" had reduced all to a pinpoint of fact, and now that fact, unencumbered, was expanding to full significance. Human beings are accustomed to thinking of \"n ature\" as including all animate and inanimate life forms, themselves included. It was the appro ach of the Church of Satan, and later of the Temple of Set, to single out self-consciousness as the characteristic feature of That which stood in contrast to the harmony of the natural cosmos. In fact all life has some degree of intelligence [not to be confused with self-consciousness], and somewhere within that intelligence is a subcomponent of se lf-consciousness, which only becomes evident when the level of basic intelligen ce is relatively high. The error in any operation designe d to strengthen the self-consciousness necessarily follows from the fact that self-consciousness is a function of the core intelligence, and there are many other functions of intelligence as well . Initiation thus treats a \"symptom\", not a \"cause\"; this leads the \"cure\" in unanticipated directions. The Church of Satan and the Temple of Set have grappled with this problem for all the years of their existence without recognizing its actu al depth. Strengthen, exalt, and encourage the Willful Self and you cannot avoid strengthening th e natural instincts as well. No human being is free from these; they may be kept in check for years, but in eventu al moments of stress, weakness, or stimulus they will break free. They may be either creative or destructive; this is not a mere \"Jekyll / Hyde\" scenario. All initiatory efforts that are not deliberate frauds -- from the most childish to the most sophisticated -- are conceits of the self-conscious inte llect. Those that profess to be natural, universal, nirvanic, or otherwise \"Right Hand Pa th\" are ultimately exerci ses in self-delusion,"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"if in fact the adherents actual ly believe in their own rhetoric. Sooner or later the masquerade becomes tiresome, the daydream boring, and the de votee discards it in favor of other sensory stimuli. The anti-natural systems of the \"Left Hand Path\", on the other hand, think to suppress some aspects of the intellect while strengthening others. What results is a condition of strain which, should the tension become too great, will snap back to an equilibrium which may be more or less viable than it originally was. The intelligent mind cannot be \"escaped\" so eas ily. If it is argued, convinced, threatened, hypnotized, drugged, or diseased into non-rational channels, then its self-consciousness will merely reassert itself in some other form . This, I understood in the Wewelsburg, was the \"magical epitaph\" of Nazi Germany: That, in fighting against certain features of the mind, it had seemed at first to succeed -- but then had thus unleashed other, even less desirable features of that same mind which had previously remained in some rough degree of socially- controlled equilibrium before this ultimately disastrous experiment in \"conscious evolution\" was attempted. The chamber in which I stood, I now realized, was nothing less than an SS laboratory for experiments in \"conscious evolution\" -- a sort of \"Krel machine\" without computerized, science-fiction accoutrements. It was not designed to teach or educate, rather to mirror and enhance thoughts and impulses already in existe nce. Hence its effect on the consciousness could be devastating for better or for worse. The 18-year experience of the Church of Satan and Temple of Set now began to appear in a new perspective. Anton LaVey had thought to enhance conscious evolution by freeing the mind from self-imposed emotional prisons. He did so, enjoyed a measure of success, yet saw to his increasing dismay that new and more uncont rollable prisons were erected in their place. Whereas the initial ones had been socially im posed, however -- resulti ng in minds more or less tractable in society -- these replacements were the product of random, unforeseen intellectual imbalances. In a few cases the result s were those of at least temporary genius. More often, however, the results were tragically self-destructive. Anton LaVey erred in blaming the organizati on of the Church of Satan for this. The organization per se was not at fault; if anything it was a stab ilizing influence. When he decided to exploit the organi zation in 1975, those working coherently within it felt wronged, said so, and formed the Temple of Set. The Temple of Set was intended to be the perfect initiatory organizati on. It exploited no one; it offered every conceivable opportu nity to everyone. Its most va luable inheritance from the Church of Satan was a commitment to the reje ction of nonsense, occult or otherwise. The future, it seemed, was a banquet of intell ectual evolution at which to feast. Yet the Temple too began to suffer shock afte r shock -- as often as not caused by senior initiates. At first these were explained as fr eak events and blamed upon the inadequacies of the individuals in question. But as the phenom enon happened again and again, this seemed more an excuse than an explanation. Finally, in the summer of XVII, a conspiracy by several senior initiates to pervert and degrade the Temple was only barely exposed and stopped in time. But the damage was devastating, if not ind eed fatal -- not to the st ructure itself, but to the assumptions concerning initiation which ha d formed the basis of that structure."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"The Temple of Set's soaring hopes for the perf ect initiatory medium, it seemed, had been dashed. In curing the symptom which Anton La Vey had attacked, it had thought to solve the essential problem. But, just as he had focu sed his anger and contempt on the wrong thing, so the Temple had poured its trust and confidence into an improvement of that same wrong thing . The actual culprit -- the disproportionately \"evolved\" intellect -- escaped the clear comprehension of both. The forces that would lead to the destruction of the Church of Satan in 1975 were not set in motion by Wayne West in 1971; they were ac tivated on Walpurgisnacht I. Similarly the Temple of Set, thinking that it had destroye d those forces in 1975, had succeeded only in closing certain doors to them so that they w ould have to find other means of manifestation. After an initial delay, they did. Now, in the Hall of the Dead, I sought a solu tion to the dilemma of the 18-year Working. Is the lesson of I-XVIII ultimately that There Is No Way Out -- that all initiation is merely Russian roulette in fancy dress? But here the Understanding that had so far co me so powerfully and cl early failed me. It was as though the Wewelsburg, having discharged a \"b attery\" that had remained charged for 40 years, had no more current to provide. Having drunk at this magical fountain of youth, however, I myself felt energized as I had not since the North Solstices of V and X. The Hall of the Dead no w seemed an insulation against random discharge of this energy. Action must now give way to reaction; how should I direct this reaction? In considering this, my attention came to rest on the concept of the Orde r of the Trapezoid. As will be recalled, this concept as employed by both the Church and the Temple has gone through many adjustments and redefinitions over the years. Yet is has endured and attracted because it seemed to \"say something\" that th e Church and the Temple could not. What might this be? During those periods when it was not employe d as a synonym for the Priesthood, the Order has been used as a talisman to evoke a kind of diabolical schadenfreude, a grim enjoyment of the predicament of self-conscious humanity. \"Here you are in a state of Satanic self- awareness,\" it seemed to say. \"You cannot escape it; you cannot cha nge it for the better -- or for the worse. Therefore: Experience it; savor its taste, sense its exquisite pain and pleasure. Do not wallow in it like an animal in warm mud; rather cut it as you would a fine gem and behold the brilliance of its facets.\" When singing this song of Lorelei, the Order ha s seemed oddly antithetic al to the Church of Satan and Temple of Set, both of which incorp orated the premise of self-awareness but which then promised different types of escape, cha nge, and improvement [thus the justification for affiliation, as well as the success-barometer of the degree system]. As an \"Ur-Doppelgaenger\" of these creative institutions, how ever, the Order's name and presence has waxed with their setbacks and waned with their succe sses. It is not an \"evil antit hesis\" as much as it is a mirrored image -- an alternate setting for the Graal of the Prince of Darkness. "},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Sanctum Sanctorum and \"Mittelpunkt der Welt\", was the Earthly focus of That which has been thus symbolized by the Order of the Trapezoid. The reality of this chamber rushed in upon me. This was no Hollywood set, no ordinary room painted and decorated to titillate the senses. 1,285 inmates of the Niederhagen concentration camp died during the recons truction of the Wewelsburg for the SS. If the Marble Hall and the Walhalla were memorials to a certain unique quality in mankind, they also serve as grisly reminders of the pe nalty which mankind pays for that quality. I saw before me the sigil of the Order of th e Trapezoid as originally designed by Anton LaVey: the pentagram within a trapezoid extend ing slightly below the two lower points, the three curved 6's, the trident rising from the flames of Hell. I saw its late r design in the Church, the 6's and the flames now gone. I saw its first de sign in the Temple of Set: the Tcham scepter with the head and forked tail of Set replaci ng the Satanic trident. I saw Ronald Barrett's subsequent concept: a simple pentagra m with the four upper points connected. So now the principle should be completed -- the Law of the Trapezoid finally and completely fused into its emblem. There appeared then the Si gil of the Order as repr oduced here. It is a return to the initial Sigil, with the follow ing changes: The curved-line fires of Hell are replaced by the Black Flame, whose emanations are rays, not flickering tongues. There are nine rays, each in strict mathematical propor tion to the pentagram or trapezoid. The source- point of the Black Flame completes the Pentagra m, as called for in the Book of Coming Forth by Night . Two of the rays of the Flame complete the inverse pentagon about the pentagram, creating a total of nine Golden S ection trapezoids in the entire si gil. The three 6's are restored, but with no curved lines. The Set-headed and -tailed Tcham scepter of ancient Khem rises from the Black Flame, its head at the center of the pentagram. Its tail, against the three central rays of the Flame, forms a \"W\" denoting the \"Walhalla\" or Hall of the Dead at Schloss Wewelsburg, the Great Gate of the Po wers of Darkness in our Time. The direction of the Working's reaction seemed clear before me; I thus cast forth the full existence of the Order of the Trapezoid into th e world. After 18 years the Key has been forged in the Word of Set, and the Gate of the Wewelsburg is opened. Where the Church of Satan and the Temple of Se t have appeared, so has the shadow of That signified by the Order been reflected. Now it has b een loosed in its full force. Whether or not the sacred Priesthood continues to exist, the Or der will do so: for its re lease is an inevitable legacy of the I-XVIII Working. Mankind received the utopian visions of the Church of Satan and Temple of Set only as it strived to be worthy of them; it will continue to receive them only as it continues to prove itself so worthy. But the Order of the Trapezoid, whether known by its true name or by countless others, will always exist -- not as a visible institution, but as a principle in the intelligent mind. Anton Szandor LaVey's Law of the Trapezoid will endure as well: Those who recognize the principle will be able to turn it to their deli berate use [whether to their ultimate benefit or detriment]; those who do not will nonetheless be subject to it [whether to their ultimate benefit or detriment]."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"So It Is Done. The Wewelsburg Formula In July of XXVI, a fellow Black Magician a nd I attempted a Working of Greater Black Magic, the goal of which was to \"link up\" with the current of the Wewelsburg Working as it was then operative in the world at large. Prior to this, I had been considering the Working record of the Grand Master Emeritus, and was puzzled by certain features of the Working in Westphalia that I intuited woul d perhaps resolve themselves w ithin a G.B.M. context of my own. From my preparatory study, I concluded th at the Law of the Trapezoid was key to tapping into the contemporary action and mani festation of the year XVII Working, so we commenced the ritual with a recitation of the La w as a simple means of evocation. From this point on, all invocations and calls were of a spontaneous nature. After the invocation of the Powers of Dar kness, I immediately became aware of a kind of vortex of force welling up within the chambe r which force seemed to wash over the room, bringing in its wake a stream of images I realized were represen tative of the magical/historical evolution spoken of in the Ipsissimus' text. Most of these images were of a disconcerting cast, and the emotional impact of realizing a c onnection had been made with the Wewelsburg Current was immense. The remainder of the Working was spent occupied with what can only be called Watching , a technique which this particular Working impart ed, and which has been a mainstay of certain of my magical work since. This is, of course , no ordinary form observation -- rather, it is a sharp, hypersensitive state where much can be revealed if the mind very simply and with attention \"looks\" into the matte r or question at hand. There is nothing of a thought vacuum or any attempt at negating consciousness invol ved in such watching. It is a matter of consciousness and content alone. What did I experience? To state the revelation of the Working would sound banal and obvious. However, what was critical to the Rema nifestation of the Working in the days and weeks to follow was the peculiar sense of having not only accessed the reality of the Wewelsburg Working, but the almost eerie serenity that accompanied and followed its engagement. I realized that while much had b een encountered, there was much more to what had been \"seen\" than could be initially assim ilated.

Certainly the questions which now arise in the reader's mind are, \"This is all very nice, even interesting, but of what real value was the Wo rking? What was learned or at least, what processes for further learning or understanding were engendered relative to the Wewelsburg Working?\" I hope the following observations will perhaps illuminate some of the aspects and impact of my Working as they informed my su bsequent experience and Initiation over time. In my function as Priest of Set, I have more than once encountered Setia ns critical of other Initiates with apparent \"vices\" they seemingl y indulge without regret, and for which they neither apologize nor make excuse. I have lear ned to respond to the faultfinding magician with these or similar questions: Do you equate Xe per and Initiation with virtue or perfection? Does the Work of Coming Into Being necessarily entail the eradication of faults, bad habits, compulsive/obsessive behaviors, and the like? Often the mere asking of such questions jars something in the Initiate's memory, and the chan ge in perspective is instantaneous. This is because, as any individual who has truly done the work of Self knows, Initiation is both the promise and the peril -- and there is nothing nece ssarily proportionate about the end result. As the Wewelsburg Working points out, \"Initiation ... tr eats a 'symptom', not a 'cause'; this leads the 'cure' in unanticipated directions.\" A great price is paid for forgetting this, particularly where issues much less prosaic than the one cited above are concerned. When one Initiates, nothing is overlooked or untouc hed. It is almost a truism that in matters Initiatory, the positive and negative poles of a ny experience, quality, or attribute (including the so-called virtues and vices) are caused to oscillate at incredib ly accelerated rates. It then becomes difficult to distinguish between these polarities, a necessary component to achieving the temporary equilibrium necessary to choosing and effecting authentic change. This is why the Left Hand Path lays such emphasis on \"w akefulness,\" realizing from experience the destructive power in inattention or unwilled \"sleep.\" Once the machinery of Initiation is engaged, the dangers of falling asl eep while operating that machinery become obvious. Human forgetfuln ess and confusion makes the constant reiteration of this issue critical. Even then, there are no guarantees. One of the problems functioning here has to do with the aberrant phenomena of Self- consciousness itself. For consciousness to be awar e of itself, the erecti ng of parameters about experience is both necessary and hazardous. It can happen that such parameters -- for one reason or another -- lock up the psyche so completely that it b ecomes trapped within the very cycles which impart integrity to the experientia l paradigm. Church of Satan and Temple of Set histories provide ample hindsight examples of this phenomena. Conversely, while there is no escaping these temporary parameters, in the case of successful Initiatory experience they more properly function as \"gestation tanks\" rather th an the prisons alluded to in the Wewelsburg Working. But again, as that Working so clearly states, there are no assu rances or guides for successful navigation through these constructs, as they resist c odification and elucidation in any but the most general terms due to the idiosyncratic nature of the Self-conscious psyche. Clearly the paradoxical consequences of Self-c onscious Initiation cannot be taken lightly. The question of whether one can successfully engage the process is perh aps secondary to the question of whether one should make the attemp t in the first place given the odds. While the"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"Temple of Set can certainly point to several outstanding examples of success, consideration of its Initiatory failures is perhaps equally instructive. That said, the Setian emphasis on individual evolution as opposed to that of the collective or of particular human units whose main emphasi s is on the evolution of the unit and not the individuals who comprise it, speaks to a profound apprehension of Initiatory phenomena. Indeed, if anything is to be le arned from the catastrophes of past totalitarian regi mes, it is not that the Initiatory proces s does not work in this capacity, but rather that it works all too well, bearing the inherent possibilities for \"good\" and \"evil\" on a gra nd scale within itself. If one considers that the problem is due to the \"phe nomena of life,\" once cannot help but begin to grasp the inescapability and magnitude of th e human predicament regarding its conscious direction. Here too, one begins to the understand th e idea and necessity fo r an Initiated \"elite\" in the Setian (Platonic) -- though not necessarily polit ical – sense. It occurs to me, given the insights of the Wewelsburg Working and recent developments concerning the angular re lationships within the Seal of Runa , that the Law of the Trapezoid is an extraordinarily succinct formulation of th e paradoxical nature of the human psyche, the consequences of which are experienced according to one's appreciation (or lack thereof) of the underlying principles. Herein lies the reason for undertaking the Initia tory process: As the Wewelsburg Working explicitly suggests, \"There Is No Way Out.\" The concomitant lure of unknown promise mitigates -- even transforms -- the resulting existential sense of oppression for only those few we call the Elect. I recall that I shuddered on first consideri ng the culminating action of the Wewelsburg Working, where what had been confined for fort y years was once again cast back out into the World of Horrors full force. I remember reco iling from the realiza tion of what had been wrought, asking myself how any sane magician could possibly dare to raise and unshackle that Darkness which had been at the root of so much human degradation and suffering. I then realized that to have done othe rwise would have meant working at cross-purposes to Xeper, and that the Ipsissimus had done the only thing possible were he to remain true to that Mandate of which he is defender. A decade ea rlier he had conceived of the knowledge and vision of \"perfect freedom.\" Al ong with the potential devastati on integral to the Wewelsburg Working was impressed upon that Sending the cri tical memory of what that freedom had historically achieved and co st in both terror and magnificence. Lest we forget. The Order of the Trapezoid which serves as the unique vehi cle through which the force of the Wewelsburg Working is Remanife st, occupies a unique positi on on the border separating the Lands of Initiated and non-Ini tiated humanity. A door opens out onto each respective domain, revealing a maze of angular and mirrored halls within. From these halls issue sights and sounds which sometimes inform, yet more of ten confound the inhabitants of both Lands, though the reactions to such confounding are quite different in each. This has always been a function of the Order. From within these flame-lit halls, on i ce-laden nights, echoes the sound of laughter, sometimes wild like the howling of wolves, some times muffled and indistinct like the dead. One must give close attention to the timbre and pitch of this laughter. One must exercise great care in hearing. Perhaps the la ughter is the lusty boasting of the sumble, perhaps the murderous despair of Budli's daughter. It is alwa ys significant and alwa ys reflective of that which has been, that which is coming to be , and that dying to be reborn. The Wewelsburg Working, which was begun as an attempt to unders tand certain destructiv e elements relative"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"to events within the Temple of Set, ended w ith not merely a revelation but a celebration and reaffirmation of that same quality in human c onsciousness which had so imperiled the Temple as an institution. This is indeed a dark irony, the blackest humor. One of the most notable aspects of the Wewels burg Working lies in the certain knowledge of the precariousness and risk involved in this un dertaking we have elec ted. Truly these very risks define us and isolate us. At the same ti me, they serve to impel us onward, despite very real and demonstrable dangers, to seek against all odds in th e direction of the Mysteries. Walhalla! A Thought for the Aeons Since I first entered the Temple of Set, the id ea of consecutive initiatory aeons has been of particular interest to me. I have sought th rough both personal study and initiatory experience to understand and Understand what the collectiv e significance of these aeons is all about. While I know that the best explanation would co me from one of our VI° Initiates, I'm going to give it a shot from a II° perspective, empl oying my abilities of Understanding as they have evolved up to this point, so please bear with me. To begin, this relatively short article is not th e place to go into a discussion of the history and origins of the idea of cosmic aeons. An excelle nt discussion of this can be found in Magus Flowers' recent book Fire and Ice, which I highl y recommend to those interested in looking further into this subject. Rather, I wish to di scuss the four aeons as recognized by the Temple of Set and their significance in th e spiritual evolution of humanity. Classification: V2 - A20 - 1 Author: Eulit M.

This would include all of the various Goddess-oriented and fertility cults, both known and unknown, that have existed since the dawn of humanity. The namesake of this aeon, the Egyptia n goddess Isis, can be seen in the most simple terms as the personification of nature itself (or herself). As Nature provides the essentials needed for the physical existence of humanity, nature is perceived as a conscious organism that is to be worshipped and served, with the individual elements within that organism being merely interacting parts of a larger whole, humanity included. The aeon of Osiris is somewhat more sophisticated than that of Isis, t hough its core principles are essentially the same. The essential features characterizing this aeon are 1) an all-inclusive father god who is to be worshipped and who la ys down imperative laws that humanity must obey in order to gain the favor of that god, and 2) a god who dies and is then resurrected, such as Osiris or Jesus, and whose death and re surrection experiences are to be followed as examples by which humanity may gain salvation. Examples of this include the initiation ceremonies of the ancient mystery schools and other elements of traditional Western occultism (eg: Freemasonry and the Golden Dawn) whereby the death, burial, and resurrection of Osiris (o r Christ) are reenacted and assimilated by the Initiate. There is also traditional Christianity, whereby one symbolically dies to one's self in order to take on the spirit of Christ, which will lead to acceptance back into the favor of God (ie: nature, or the physical universe). As the initiated eye can see, these two aeons are primarily two different ways of saying the same thing: The individual psyche is merely a small portion of a collective essence. This is why either nature itself or a neter representing nature, whethe r Isis, Osiris, or Jehovah, must be worshipped and appeased. By doing so, humanity causes no interference in the ever- churning machinery of the Great Law, and is accepted into the essence of the physical universe, thereby eliminating the need for i ndividual determination of one's destiny and actions. Let us now turn to the two subsequent aeons, beginning with that of Horus (HarWer). This aeon was formally announced in 1904, when Alei ster Crowley received The Book of the Law which laid down the essentials of the new aeon, from what he referred to as a praetor-human intelligence which identified itself as Aiwass. While the ultimate goal of the initiatory system of this aeon is the conscious unification of the individual psyche with the phys ical universe, it nevertheless has many features remarkably different from the previous aeons, and in many ways has more in common with the aeon to follow. To begin with, the guiding Word (princip le) of this aeon is Thelema, meaning Will. Furthermore, its two main imperatives, \"Do Wh at Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law,\" and \"Every Man and Woman is a Star,\" are clear ly of an individual-oriented nature, which alone separates it from its preceding aeons. Th e god(s) of this aeon are understood not as celestial tyrants to be worshi pped and obeyed, but as activating principles of various"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"potentialities within the human psyche to be invoked as one chooses. A far cry from the Osirians! Now we come to the Aeon of Set. Like its predecessor aeon, it was formally announced in 1975 CE (the year X) by the god of the aeon through the person of Mi chael Aquino in The Book of Coming Forth by Night . The aeon actually began in 1966 CE with the Age of Satan, announced by Anton LaVey. The guiding Word of th is age, Indulgence, was assimilated into the framework of the Aeon of Set. This new aeon cleared the air of all that came befo re it. It asserted that the individual psyche is just that, not a part of a collective essence or a servant of some god. Th e initiatory system is directed towards Xeper, the Word of the aeon, by which the initiate stri ves towards his or her own divinity by Becoming that which one Wills into Being. The process (or rather our understanding of it) has further been enhanced by Remanifestation, which can be summarized as the repeated and cyclic process of Xeper. Furthermore, the being responsible for the inculcation of individuality into the human psyche, Set, was clearly revealed at the inauguration of the aeon. Set is a god not to be worshipped and fawned upon, but rather one who is honored and strengthened by the exercise of his Gift by those of his Elect race. One can clearly see that both the aeons of Horus and Set are directed towards dynamic spiritual evolution, the difference being that the Aeon of Set give s one a more clearly delineated path and goal than its predecessor aeo n, with its somewhat \"perplexed\" system of initiation. Both of these initiato ry systems are of an elitist na ture, not being for the masses of humanity at large, by virtue of the relatively high levels of intellig ence and personal effort required for their comprehension and utilization. The sheep-like condition of the majority of humanity finds more welcome and comfort in the static, inertial systems of the aeons of Isis and Osiris, particularly the latter. Now that I have summed up each aeon, what am I to make of them as far as their collective significance in humanity's spiritual evolution is concerned? From my perspective as an Adept, I see the aeons not so much as periods of time in religious history, but rather as initiatory pathways existing simultaneously. As Setians we operate within the Aeon of Set. Thelemites operate within the Aeon of Horus. Buddhists, Christians, white magicians, Wiccans, and the like operate within the aeons of Osiris and Isis. All of the aeons exist and will continue to exis t for certain sectors of the human race. While those aeons existing prior to that of Set are no longer the path to true Initiation, they serve their purposes insofar as giving some sort of dire ction to those who are not of the Elect. While the Aeon of Set exists for anyone to aspire towards, only those w ith the intelligence, understanding, and Will to Become of the Elect of the Prince of Darkness can enter its realm.

Reflections on the Set Animal Scholars have argued endlessly over the z oological identity of the animal which iconographically and hieroglyphically stands for the god Set. The c ontroversy is elucidated in te Velde's book Seth, God of Confusion (#2G, pp. 13-26). After cons idering various animals, e.g. the ass, oryx antelope, greyhound, fennec, jerboa, camel, okapi, long-snouted mouse, aardvark, giraffe, and the hog or boar, as candida tes for the original Set-animal -- generally based on some single, distinctive as pect of the figure -- we must c onclude with te Velde that it represents a mythical or imaginary beast. Te Velde identi fies it with a kind of \"griffin\" -- somehow related to the Babylonian mythic crea ture -- called the ' (axex) in Egyptian. He shows that there are essentially three distinctive features of the graphic representation of the Set-animal: (1) a curved snout, (2 ) square, brush-like \"ears\", a nd (3) a forked or brush-like tail. These features do not allow identification with any known animal. This situation is unique in the history of the iconography of the Egyptian divi nities, since the zoomorphic attributes of all the other gods may be easily identified. A further aspect of the imagery of the Dark Lord is the scepter ca rried by many gods (and some goddesses) in the Egyptian pantheon, e.g. Ho rus the Elder, Thoth, and Xepera. Several scholars identify both the 'm (djam) and ws (us) scepters with Set (cf. te Velde, p. 90). The 'm scepter with its crooked shaft is thought to represent thunde r, and either one may be considered an expression of the a ggressive, martial force of Set. The significance of these facts is relevant to Setians and to the philos ophy of the Aeon of Set today. First, the image of the Set-animal is an imaginary one -- created by the psyche of man, or impressed upon the human psyche from outside the natural order. (Ne ither alternative is mutually exclusive.) This demonstrates the pr imacy of the active psyc he in Setian thought, both ancient and modern.

The fact that the Set-animal does not occur in nature makes it clear th at it -- and the god it expresses – is of extra-dimensional or \"extra-t errestrial\" origin – \"... and from my manifest semblance, which alone is not of Earth. \"  The North Solstice Working for the Illumination of the Relationship between Woden and Set Classification: V2 - A41.W - 1 Author: Stephen E.

Aforetime swore I kinship by blood with my Dark Brother Set-heh, that we might one day rule the Worlds together through our Essence, hight Man. With the Earth our blood is mixed. 3.

As I, Woden, Lord of Light, Drighten of Darkness, have wandered forth in the world, hidden within my folk and bound to their fate, th e Black Brother has wandered free from the day of his exile to wander the worlds unbounded but homeless. On the southern road we often met. 7. Before I, Woden, wandered forth and gave th e gift, also given by Lord Set, to Man, the Wains were one and naught was known. 8. The gift is but one, and it is the Essence a nd Form of Wisdom, Will, and Weal. From the gift are all things come. 9.

Seek only the seeker within, and thou wilt find naught but us."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":" Commentaries on The Book of the Wanderings of Set and Woden 1. Here Woden, the master of inspiration, speaks and identifies his pl ace as the North Star. \"North\" means \"downward\" or \"leftward,\" and th e North Star is at th e pole or axis of the Earth. Therefore it is \"close to our plane\" and a gateway or access-point to the starry realms. Woden refers to his eye (the one which remains with his essence) as th e North Star, which is at the head of the constellation known as Ursa Minor or in Germanic tradition the Lesser Wain or Wain of the Moon. Also the fact that the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Sun is reemphasized. 2. In this passage Woden states that he became the blood-brother of Set, making a pact with him. This is reminiscent of the blood-brother hood between Woden and L oki, but we learn that this pact was made for rulership of the \"wor lds\" -- the entire cosmos on all \"planes.\" The method of the ritual referred to is one in which the blood of th e participants is mixed with earth. It is possible that here the \"Earth\" referr ed to is the reality of Man on this planet. Man as we know him is the vessel of this blood-pa ct, and is the third pa rtner in a triad. The physical reality of Man is the result of this mi xture of the Conscious E ssence with the Earth. 3. In the third passage we discover something about when this might have taken place. Woden says that Set came to th e northern heavens as the resu lt of an exile from Egypt, and that they again came into proximity as a resu lt -- Woden in the lesser or Lunar Vehicle and Set in the Greater or Solar Vehicl e. (The constellation of the Thi gh is identical to that of Ursa Major.) The ongoing relationship between the various Deities of Darkness and the Darkness which is Light is also stated, and a certain identity between Woden/ Set/Satan/Lucifer as historical manifestations is made clear. Eternal affinity of essence is shown by temporal affinity of form. 4. Both gods now have their seats in the north ern sky, but their cults are hardly the most \"popular\" in a conscious sense. Their truth does rule, however, in the hidden heart of Man. Only the true initiate, unafraid of the truth with in, is able to know this . The injunction to \"see now that our ways are the same\" refers to the virtual id entity between their essential forms as expressed in their cons tellations. Both gods are identified w ith the innermost consciousness of the Self, which is the Essence of these gods and of Man. In this fourth passage the text begins to be written in the first person plural, whic h indicates the melding of Woden/Set which took place in the Working context. 5. This passage refers to the eternally transformative nature of these gods. The concept of \"wandering\" in this text equa tes with \"transforming.\" The term \"Age\" seems to be both a temporal concept and an expression of Man's evolving Essence. Cf. the Greek aeon (an \"Earthly age\") and the Germanic aldaz (\"the age of ma n, life, man\"). 6. Here we come to what seems to be an impor tant distinction between Woden and Set: that Woden has always been attached to his par ticular group, who took him with them wherever they ruled, so that the Wodenic seed-idea wa s spread from the northern regions to north Africa, Spain, Italy, France, England, and eastern Europe -- not once but in several historical waves. Set, however, had been freed from th e ties to one particular group and had made transformations within several cultures -- \"shape-shifting,\" as it were, through Satan, Lucifer, etc. until X A.S., when his Temple was re-founded in a land far from his original home. It"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"seems that the meetings \"on the southern road \" refer to historical events or phenomena -- perhaps the invasions of Egypt by Indo-Europe ans in archaic times, and/or encounters of Wodenic initiates with those of Ptolemaic Egypt when the former came to Egypt among the Roman legions. 7-9. the last three passages touch on the gi ft bestowed on Man by the primal god of consciousness, and on astro/cosmological proces ses which relate to the inner link between Woden and Set. It is clear that what is known as the Gift of Set and the Gift of Woden are identical, and that it is the gift of consciousness. The syntax here is rather obscure, but it would seem to indicate that at some \"time be fore\" this act of givi ng was carried out, the constellations of the Ursae \"were one\" -- i.e. a ll matter/energy was condensed in an inter- manifestation phase, and the stuff of these stars, along with all others, wa s amassed. This is an inter-consciousness phase in whic h the paradigms of consciousness in a macro/microcosmic model were manifested, a sign of which is the similarity of the constellations of the Ursae or wains. The greater one is more universal, general, and closer to the equator. The lesser one is more particular, closer to the pole, and closer to the Earth itself. The formal similarity between these two constellations from our persp ective indicates an esse ntial, eternal inner affinity between them. The final passage is instruction from the unifi ed voice of Set-heh and Woden: to seek the transformation of the Self according to the innate patterns contained in the Gift itself. In the unending process of transformation the true Es sence of the Gods of Consciousness will be found -- and recognized as identic al with the Self of Man. Concluding Summary Set and Woden are expressions of the same ultimate Intelligence -- one of the south, the other of the north. On a planetary scale this is expr essed in a polar-equatorial pattern: Woden with a polar rotation and Set with a rotation around the equator of the globe. Each has a unique purpose: Set a universal one and Woden a par ticular one (expressed through, or in tandem with his folk -- which is not the \"Germanic peopl es\" as a whole, but rather a hidden elite of peoples touched by his psychophysical stream). Set, when sent from the southern to the nor thern sky, became fully universal and free from necessary connection with the Egyptians (who re jected him on a national scale). The ultimate function and Will of this Intelligence is the development of Man -- the primary act of which was to bestow its Gift, a portion of its own E ssence or Being, which is then inherited along genetic patterns (fleshly and/or initiatory), and which become s the Self of individuals among the Elect. Set-Woden are South-North, equato rial-polar, universal-particular manifestations of the same \"extraterrestrial\" Intelligence/enti ty. Set, due to detachment, is himself not subject to evolution, but is its agent or th e \"evolver.\" Thus he remains eternal in Form. Woden, due to his attachment, is himself subject to evoluti on as a self-conscious ag ent or participant. Therefore his followers imitate but do not worship him.

Surely Set, watching and waiting for th ose sixty-two years, approached exasperation more than once, and we who live and practice ou r magic in the Aeon of HarWer's Other Self can appreciate why when we look back at the confusion of that Aeon. But who or what was HarWer, actually? One of Ma gus Aleister Crowley's worst errors was to incorrectly identify the Lord of his Aeon. This damning error brought about the proclaiming of Horus the Younger as the Crowned and Conque ring Child, and further led to innumerable nonsensical errors and confusion. There is sma ll wonder this came about , since the Lord of the Aeon found peculiar goings-on taking place in the form of his Magus determined to interpret all acts and interventions in the light of a completely different god. The fact that the real god of the Aeon continued to act as he hims elf saw fit and proper, and that this at times conflicted severely with the Magus' own actions and interpretations, was also of little help. Although this error on the part of the Magus Aleister Crowle y did severe damage, the Aeon managed to progress to the time of Set-HarWer, th e Age of Satan, and still little attention was paid to the real god of the previous Aeon. Let us now take a look back and see HarWer, Set's Opposite Self, through the eyes of perspective. A very ancient god, HarWer, or Haroeris, known also as Heru-ur and Horus the Elder, was seen as a 'Face of Heaven' and a twin god of Set. Set was seen as the night face and HarWer the day one. Our ancestors in magic, those old inhabitants of Khem, delighted in and dedicated themselves to providing names and assigning values to everything: on moonless nights HarWer was known as Mekhenti-en-irty, \"He on whose brow there are no eyes,\" and on moonlit nights he was hailed as Mekhenti-ir ty, \"He on whose brow there are the Two Eyes.\" Representative of his twin aspects, it is of interest to no te that the two eyes symbolized certain celestial objects, and were in strict or der.

It is interesting to speculate that th e possibility of the left being \"wrong\" might have some origin in the left eye of Ha rWer being associated with night, and therefore with the Prince of Darkness. Even today your physician, when prescribing any optic medication destined for the left eye, will write \"o.s.\" in his orders, thereby abbreviating os sinistre and either unknowingly or un caringly assigning that eye a somewhat negative worth. Knowing physicians as I do, I doubt they would be very impressed with such a discourse; but you can now look knowingly if such treatment is prescribed. It is perhaps not completely Magus Crowley's fa ult that he erred in his Lord's correct name. After all, HarWer was known as Horus the Elder also, and was depicted with the familiar hawk's head which Horus the Younger made famous. The similarity ends there, and the name of Horus becomes almost exclusively associat ed with the Younger Horus, the 'Crowned and Conquering Child.' A pity, because HarWer had many positive attributes and associations, being also both Lord of the South and the Lord of Ombos (a cult center of Set). He also became associated with Shu, half of the first divine couple an d sometimes seen as a god of light, thereby indirectly being a part of the sustaining forces of nature and the world. But notwithstanding all the hist orical and philosophical tradi tions concerning HarWer, that aspect of Set remains alive within the Temple and the world. But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the Cosmic Inertia without having to assume its place. And so HarWer must exist while Set exists. Reading and understanding this wi ll also help clarify the stat ement from France's The Revolt of the Angels , wherein it is said that if Satan c onquers God, then Satan becomes God. Wise gods and magicians do not destroy everythi ng not to their par ticular likings. And so we hail this god, this Other Face, and se e him not as the blurred image from the Aeon expiring in I A.S., but as the ancient and honorab le being he is. Trains of thought will begin ruling out the existe nce of what is if one considers what might not have come about had there been no HarWer to hold against the mechanical laws of the natural universe, for HarWer himself was in time immemorial the sign of the first Xeper.

It is not, nor is it intended to be either an exhaustive or definitive commentary. That will be th e purpose of a future commentary."},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"In approaching the analysis of the text, I have adopted three sets of guidelines: 1. The material required to elucidate the meani ng of the text should be near at hand -- scholarly gymnastics should not be required in order to make sense of the basic outline of the text. The more remote the supporting material, the more justification that is required for introducing it. If obscure material is requi red to elucidate the core meaning of a text, then the validity of the text itself is suspect. 2. Given a range of interpretations for any give n passage, preference is given to the most conservative interpretation. While it is too restrictive to de mand that an interpretation be entirely consistent with the generally accepted current interpretation of a primary Temple document (since our purpose is always to refine and deepen such interpretations), all reasonable attempts at discovering such a continuity must be made before an inconsistent in terpretation is accepted. 3. It is assumed that the concepts in this text have a general magical and philosophical validity rather than an entirely personal va lidity (or no validity whatsoever). This assumption is required on my part in order to attempt a meaningf ul analysis of the text, but the arbitrators of that assumpti on must and will be those who examine and Work with these concepts. The Book of Astaroth raises many questions. It is not possible for me at this time to answer all of them to my own satisfaction. Frequently, I point to another text which I believe suggests the correct interpretation of a passage rather th an trying to force an in terpretation. One of the purposes for circulating this initial analysis is to obtain considered responses that will help me to develop this Work further. II. History of the Book of Astaroth The writing of the Book of Astaroth is intimately related to (a nd a product of) my Work with Xem, which began in September of XXVIII -- although it also has other origins which antedate my entering the Temple of Set. While it is my belief that the evaluation of this (or any other) text should not re quire that the reader posse ss a detailed knowledge of the Workings that ultimately resulted in it, there is at least one Working which, in my opinion, is both an important supplement to the Book of Astaroth and a significant Work in its own right. The record of that Working, as it was originally sent to a few member s of the Priesthood, is included as Appendix I. In additi on, there were other specific ritu al events that may serve to clarify the context of this text . I will summarize the most import ant of those events here, and refer to the others throughout the commentary as appropriate. My Work with Astaroth began during the desi gn of an Obsidian Gate way Pylon ritual for Walpurgisnacht in XXVIII, and marks the point at which I considered myself to have Become Setian rather than \"being called Se tian.\" It also marks the point at which I began to view the Temple of Set as embodying a re ligion rather than as a magi cal/initiatory society. Working with the Form of Astaroth was very productive for me, and at the Order of Shuti Working at the Set XIV Conclave I took Astaroth as my magi cal name. I was not partic ularly interested in the history of the Form – which is evident from th e fact that even a little bit of research would have immediately revealed that, historicall y, Astaroth was a corruption of the only other Neter that I had ever worked with -- Astarte. More immediately, the Book of Astaroth was the response to my attempt to Understand the meaning of \"Astaroth once agai n walks among mankind\" in my XemSet Working. My initial"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"interpretation of that statement was that I w ould begin manifesting more of the qualities of Astaroth in both my personal and public life, an d as a corollary, that Astaroth represented a particular emphasis of my own personality that I would enhance and more effectively manifest. This is essentially a psychological interpretation – Astaroth is regarded as being a transpersonal psychological factor in the coll ective psyche of mankind, and I regarded myself as being particularly suited to manifesting that psychic force in the world. (Expressing an archetype is not in itself a distinction – it only possesses value when the ego is neither submerged in that expression nor attempting to suppress it.) (1) While I continued (and continue) to regard that interpretation as valid, I soon also came to regard it as unnecessarily restrictive – in that I implicitly ruled out a magical significance or dimension above and beyond the psychological one. This new perspective emerged by degrees, and was largely brought about by a feel ing that something was going seriously wrong with my Initiatory Quest -- I began having a sense not only of coming to a stop, but of being on the verge of falling backward. That impasse was partially overcome when, afte r some consultation with Magister Robert Menschel, I decided to perform an Operative Working on the Aeon – but it also gave new urgency to the message \"the Book of Astaroth shall be written, the Word of Astaroth shall be spoken\" which had emerged during many of th e Workings following my XemSet Working. I had initially regarded the fulfillment of that st atement as being a distant goal, and was quite content to regard it as something I would get around to in a year or so -- instead, it acquired the character of an imperative which could onl y be ignored to my ow n detriment. Ultimately, the Book of Astaroth was written because it could no longer be avoided. III. Analysis and Commentary The Book of Astaroth Note that, contrary to what seems to be an implicit convention in the Temple regarding works that embody a Principle ( The Book of Coming Forth by Night , The Diabolicon , The Book of Opening the Way , Blasting Forth by Day or Night , etc.), this Book is named after the Principle of its inspiration rather than its Function. (2) The title would seem to indicate that Astaroth is more concerned at this point with declaring and emphasizing hi s identity than with defining his purpose. Transcribed by John A. Youril, II Dec. 21, XXVIII The Book of Astaroth was written in two sessions, on th e 20th and 21st of December XXVIII, and was completed about an hour before the Winter Solstice. The timing was not intentional on my part. In a Working some days earlier, I invoked Set to help me find the way out of the period of stas is that I seemed to have entered. My resistance to setting forth the Book of Astaroth was immediately revealed as the cause of that stasis, and I was \"informed\" that I should \"consider it well, but ... not hesitate t oo long,\" and that, to assist me, I was to \"cast three oracles on three evenings.\" Those three ev enings brought me to the 20th of December, and afte r the first section of the Book of Astaroth was completed, I expected that two more sittings would be required -- but the second and very brief third"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"section were completed on the same day. The fo regoing would seem to indicate that Astaroth considered it important to associate his Book w ith the South Solstice -- but to what purpose? The Book of Coming Forth by Night was, of course, the result of a North Solstice Working, as have been many other texts that are of primary importance in the Temple of Set, and so the Aeon of Set is symbolically associated with the North Solstice. Since the Book of Astaroth expressly addresses the Aeon of Set, I take this to mean that a temporal division in the Aeon is being marked. This view is reinforced by the subsequent passage in the Book of Astaroth in which the \"Night of the Aeon\" is spoken of. “When my time on earth drew to a close, I retired to the realm we had created and held dominion over one quarter of that luminescent sphere.” Compare with the following passage from the Diabolicon : Finally we came to a great void in space beyond which there was nothing. Lucifer said to us, Here is the end of God and its works, and here we may create our own domain. And through the power that was in him, Lucifer caused existe nce to appear where it had not been before. And Lucifer said, I name thee Hell, for here shall the presence of God never be known until the end of time. (3) Also of interest is this passage fr om Ipsissimus Aquino's commentary on the Book of the Law : (4) ....According to Pythagoras and his Egyptian ini tiatory sources, numbers are the \"building- blocks\" of existence: They are not Forms per se, but are rather the \"alphabet\" through which many Forms are made comprehensible. If Nuit is considered to be the expanse of the natural, material Universe, then the inclusion of this statement in this first chapter assumes a dditional significance. Numbers are infinite. For example, there can be countless manifestations of things which are vi ewed as quarters of wholes or as quartets of complete wholes. At th e same time the \"4-principle\" is rigid in itself and is thus a fixed component of the natural Universe. (5) Interpreting the Diabolicon far more literally than most of us would be inclined to do, the above passage from the Book of Astaroth would suggest that Hell, or the realm of the Daimons, also has a rigid and symmetrical as pect, which immediately reminds us that: Heaven must perish, Hell must perish, and man alone must remain ere the Black Flame becomes Red in the glory of its perfection. (6) And also that: ...Throughout the Universe hath the once single W ill of God been succeeded by the balance of perfect opposition, wherein the forces of the Ange ls of Heaven and those of the Daimons of Hell act to mutual frustration, serving in c oncert only to uphold the great barrier of Will between order and chaos. And man is the chil d of imbalance, who shall resolve the issue between Heaven and Hell, and w ho, unmatched by racial antithesis, shall tran scend the rule of the order of God and establish the eternal freedom of the Satanic Will. (7) "},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"What is important here is that the Gift endows us with the ability to create any Order we Will, including a mechanical and sterile one. It is not sufficient to dwell in the Black Realm -- one must continue to create within it, and ultimately transcend it. “There I dwelt in power and pleasure until the Formula of the Age of Satan issued up from the forgotten earth and stirred me fr om the mists of my absorption.” Astaroth had ceased to intervene in the a ffairs of mankind. But during the Age of Satan, Astaroth was moved by man himself to once ag ain concern himself with this world. This passage suggests a Being who is still Becoming, and who therefore cannot be an aspect of the \"Ageless intelligence.\" The Astaro th of the Diabolicon is such a personification, and it is worth noting that none of the other Daimons in the Diabolicon are named or even (apparently) alluded to. Since Astaroth seems to have attained (?) co mplete Indulgence, the reason why the Formula (and activity) of the Age of Sata n, \"Indulgence Instead of Abstinen ce,\" should stir Astaroth is unclear -- until it is remembered that Xeper was emerging from the mists of the Age of Satan. The relationship between man and the Neteru is a reciprocal one founded on Xeper. “Hear now what is spoken, for my message will come but once. Time rushes forward, and my patience is not as Great as it was in old Khem.“ Here again is the warning found in the Diabolicon , the Book of Coming Forth by Night , the Word of Set , and elsewhere. The warning in the Book of Coming Forth by Night is considerably more immediate than the one in the Diabolicon , and the urgency of the message in the Book of Astaroth seems even more urgent. The activity of Astaroth is here placed in a historical or quasi-hi storical context, and a parallel is drawn between our current circumstances and those which presumably ended the supremacy of Set in Egypt. “Understand, that we do not reti re from you again and forever, and leave the earth to its own destructive course. \"The fate of my Gifted race rests in the bal ance.\" It was for this day that this message was imparted.” The reference in this passage from The Book of Coming Forth by Night is the only direct quotation in the Book of Astaroth , and is the first reference to Set and the Aeon of Set. Until the very end of the Book of Astaroth , Set is always refe rred to indirectly. In the Book of Coming Forth by Night , that passage introduces the Word of Set : The time of the Purification is past. The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance, and I shall not recant my Word, spoken to my High Priest MehenPetTha in old Khem and now again to you. Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, and va nquish thus the feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my true Word and now are an affront to me."},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe. I created HarWer that I might define my Self. All other gods of all other times and nations have been created by men. This you know from the first Part of my Word, and from my manifest semblance, which alone is not of Earth. Note the extreme importance placed on the Word of Set : (1) it was spoken only twice, (2) it shall not be recanted, (3) it is linked to the fate of the Gifted race, (4) proclaiming it was the first task given to the Magus, (5 ) Set indicates that the truth of his own nature is indicated by the First Part, and (6) the First Part of the Word of Set was used in the Working which resulted in the Book of Coming Forth by Night . The reference to old Khem seems to tie together both the texts of the Book of Coming Forth by Night , the Word of Set , and the Book of Astaroth , and the warnings contained in them. “Long have you pondered it in pr eparation for this day.” What is warned of in Book of Coming Forth by Night and the Word of Set appears imminent in the present text. The meaning of \" The fate of my Gifted race rests in the balance... \" has long been pondered, as well as the following passage fr om the Book of Coming Forth by Night: I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid. And alone I ca nnot preserve my Elect, but I would teach them and strengthen their Will against the coming peril, that they and their blood may endure. To do this I must give further of my own E ssence to my Elect, and, should they fail, the Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended. “Hear now that you may Understand it -- fo r without Understanding it is a weapon without force.” This passage is reminiscent of \" For with no purpose the force of the mind must fail. \" (8) This passage is self-evident, and could only be justified as an emphasis that the understanding necessary for their blood to endure has not been achieved. “This I tell you as the Master of Weapons and the Glorious Aspect of War -- I who once presided over the birth of fire and iron, know ing not to what bad use this Intelligence would be applied and by what feeble hands th is gift of mine would be conveyed.” Astaroth here defines his attribut es. They are those of a God of War in a later and fuller stage of development – a point where creativity, ar tistry, and an advanced concept of nobility modify the naked destructive energy of more primitive expressions. \"The birth of fire and iron\" suggests the point at which mankind potentially became equal to the power of natural processes, which signi fied a decisive step in his evolution. Astaroth did not know to what use his gift would be put -- this recalls: \" ...memory of the future cannot exist. \" The lowercase \"gift\" would then seem to indicate an aspect or external manifestation of the Gift of Set, specifically, man's control over his en vironment (the context in which he exists). The last sentence suggests \" the feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch .\""},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"“This day, you must take back by force that which was once freely given. In what a curious fashion you have made my gift the Power of your enemies. But that is done -- now it must be undone.” There is here an imperative, but it is difficult to interpret b ecause it is not clear who our enemies are, and whether this statement is meant in a literal or allegorical sense. “There was a time, my children, when I was known as the greatest servant of this Earth's Deceiver, and a time when I myself was named this Deceiver. But this was long ago, and our Forms were often confused. Of the latter I have no thing to say, but shoul d I tell how this first came about?” This is an echo of the passage: The years of the Aeon of HarWer were confused, and I do not wish to think of them save as curiosities. But I wish to remember the Church of Satan and the Magus of that Age. Therefore let the years of my Aeon be counted from the conception of the Church of Satan. (9) However, I would resist identifying the period being discussed as bel onging to either the Aeon of Horus or the Age of Satan – the following portions of the text w ould indicate that it is still old Khem that is being spoken of. “Hear, then, the tale of our first encounter , that you may understand why I walk among you.” This introduces the second major division of the text. The use of the word \"tale\" would seem to indicate that the following is an allegory based on a historical event (which is the particular and somewhat idiosyncratic spin which I always give to that term). Any number of myth cycles suggest themselves in the following text, but since none of them are immediately compelling, I will limit my comments to the al legorical dimensions of these passages, especially as they seem to pertain to Initiation. “Two of your kind once journeyed to the lake of Fire and Life, that by day is calm, but by night is alive with a splendorous and deadly radi ance that wells up from its sacred floor.” Here is pictured a dangerous Initiatory Quest. F our elements are present: fire, life, water, and indirectly, stone. At night, the time which we tr aditionally regard as being sacred to Set and during which Set is most approachable, these el ements combine to form a radiance that is, however, deadly. “For in ancient times, the stel e of the Red God was cast into that tranquil pool, but even the deep waters could not extinguish the Life of its Flame.” The \"Red God\" is Set, and the use of that par ticular name may be intended to emphasize Set's historical aspect as a Warrior God, or alternately, to indicate a time when the nature of Set had already been misunderstood. I take the stele to refer to the Word of Set , and we are told of an attempt to destroy it by submerging it in deep wate rs (unconsciousness). We may take this as a reference to the suppression of Set by the Osiria n cults. In this passage we find \"life of its flame,\" in contrast to the previous passage, wher e we have life and fire, and also radiance. A flame is a localized and less diffuse form of fire and radiance. Also, radiance does not imply"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"the heat of fire and flame. The \"life of its flame\" would seem to signify two \"meanings\": a combination of two elements or modalities, such as Ba and Ka, and continuity. In any event, the attempt at suppre ssion was only partially successful. The First Part of the Word of Set states what it was that was being suppressed: I am within and beyond you, the Highest of Life, in majesty greater than the forces of the Universe; whose eyes are the Face of the Sun and the Dark Fire of Set; who fashioned your intelligence as his own and reached forth to exalt you; who entrusted to you dignity of consciousness; who opened your eyes that you might know beauty; who brought you the key to knowledge of all lesser things; and who enshri ned in you the Will to Come Into Being. Lift your voices, then, and recognize the Highest of Life who thus proclaims your triumph; whose being is beyond natural life and death; who came as a flame to your world and enlightened your desire for perfection and truth. Arise t hus in your glory, behol d the genius of your creation, and be prideful of being, for I am the same -- I who am the Highest of Life. “Those who turned their back on me related that the stele was of gold -- and many thereby were drawn to perish in those waters seeking t hat which had never been except in the grim imaginings of those who wo rshipped the god of death, as if the hearts of the priests of the new company of gods were light enough to cast gold in to the abyss. But let this remain a mystery.” A violent attempt at the personal or collectiv e suppression of an image or impulse leads inevitably to a compensatory psychological m ovement in which the va lue of the original object is displaced onto something else, and th ere then arises a compulsion towards the new object which is inherently dangerous, since it involves becoming enta ngled in pathological fantasizing (10) . That the Osirian priests were not pure is clear enough, and the mystery of this passage seems to be where exactly the my stery is. A rather lengthy quote from the Book of The Law seems necessary at this point: 32. From gold forge steel. 33. Be ready to fly or to smite. 34. But your holy place shall be untouched thro ughout the centuries: t hough with fire and sword it be burnt down & shattered, yet an invi sible house there standeth, and shall stand until the fall of the Great Equinox; when Hrumachis shall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place. Another prophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies; another woman shall awake the lust & worship of the Snake; another soul of god and beast shall mingle in the globed priest; anot her sacrifice shall st ain the tomb; another king shall reign; and blessing no longer be poured to the Hawk-headed mystical Lord!... Harmakhis was one of the many forms of Xepera as a symbol of regeneration, transformation, and immortality. Harmakhis was portrayed in many shapes, the most famous being that of the Great Sphinx at Giza. The \"double-wanded one\" is Set, whose symbols in ancient Egypt were the D'm (Tcham) and ws sceptres. Both sceptres were Set-headed, but the ws was distinguished by a spiral shaft and the absence of a decorative base (Set's forked tail on the D'm sceptre). On the Stele of Revealing, Ra Harakte holds a D'm sceptre. The Setian sceptres signified magical power, as"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"opposed to the crook & flail sceptres symboliz ing the Pharaoh's roles as shepherd and taskmaster of the Egyptian nation. \"Fresh fever from the skies\": the Book of Coming Forth by Night . \"Another woman\": Lilith Aquino, the Serpent One: Magistra Templi IV of the Temple of Set and One of the Nine. \"The globed priest\" and \"anothe r sacrifice\": Anton Szandor LaVey [who shaved his head to signify his office as High Priest of the Church of Satan], and the destruction of the Church of Satan as precondition for the manifestation of the Aeon of Set. \"Another king\": Ra-en-Set suten net .\" (11) Attention should also be given to the meaning attached to the Gold symbolizing the Degree of Ipsissimus. (12) “The two who followed the dead but not the Dead one sought not a treasure for the marketplace, but rather the truth of thei r own hearts and the life which continues.” The dead are those who tried to Open the Way, but failed. This is an indication that we can learn from the collective experiences of the dead ones. They are not to be confused, however, with the \"Dead One,\" who is the Osirian Principl e. That \"which continues\" signifies both the quest for eternal life and the continuity of the Gift (and all it implies). “But having travelled so far, still they hesi tated too long on the shore in indecision, and the time turned against them.” This is an allusion to the Book of Opening the Way : ....The actualization of Xem is the direct oppos ite of those things Magus Barrett lists as detrimental to the quest. [\"To hesitate, to rati onalize in human terms, to feel negativeness or fear or lack of confidence. . .\"] Action, awareness, and posit ive assertion are the keys to speeding one toward Xem. Conscious awareness is imperative as we quest forth, due to the fact there are myriad ways open to us. Beyond this, there is the awareness of the main direction to be taken, and th en there is the Work for it. (13) “In the dark waters, the light of eleven colo rs bathed them with its seven rays, and although they brought the stele of black stone back to th e realm of the living, they themselves were injured by the effort, and I who came upon them felt compassion and told them that they would only sleep for a time.” Here we find another reference to \"the splendorous and deadly radiance.\" A radiance is often the result of a process of tr ansformation -- a process which involves both destruction and creation. The symbolism in this passage is difficult. Eleven is the number of Nuit (14) , which can also be interpreted as the prima materia, and so I am inclined to understand this passage as referring to the process of magical creation or transformation of the material universe, with the seven rays being the vivifyi ng force which operates on it."},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"The black stone is that which is the mysterious and invisible source of this vivifying Power. To bring it back to the realm of the living is to bring it back to consciousness or to bring about a renewed Understanding of what it is. Both material creation by magi cal means and the knowledge of th is art are pictured as being very dangerous -- having the potential to injure or kill the magician. Bu t it is the Mastery of this art that would seem to be necessary fo r the quest for immortality to be successful. The \"deception\" of Astaroth is described, but the meaning is not readily apparent. In connection with this passage it is wo rth considering the following remarks from Black Magic in Theory and Practice : In the Church of Satan the Grail was called the \"chalice of ecstas y,\" and its contents symbolized the elixir of life. In the Temple of Set it assumes an elder and more esoteric identity. The pre-Christian Gra il is one of the most ancien t and powerful symbols of the European Black Magic tradition ( #14B, C, D, U). It symbolizes Truth in its purest and most sublime Form. The Grail is ever sought, never found by the profane, for they fear Truth even when they profess otherwise. Should they chance upon the Grail through innocence or accident, they dash it from their lips in terror or, upon drinking from it, come hideously to grief for their rashness. Only the Initiate of the Left-Hand Path may dare to drink from the Grail with impunity, and only he shall see it brought forth before him whenever he desires. Woe to him who drinks from the Grail with dece it and falsehood in his heart; it shall consume him utterly. \"The Knights of the Grail live from a st one of purest kind. If you do not know it, It shall here be named to you. It is called lapsit exillis .\" -Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parsival \"Hic lapis exilis extat precio quoque vilis Spernitur a stultis, amatur plus ab edoctis.\" [This insignificant stone is i ndeed of trifling value. It is despised by fools, the more cherished by the wise.] -Arnold of Villanova, Rosarium Philosophorum “And when their bodies had perished, I, Astaro th, completed their quest and delivered unto mankind the stele which had been the glory of Ancient Khem.” To say that \"their bodies had pe rished\" rather than saying that they had died suggests that some portion of them lived on. Astaroth portrays himself as being an agent in the preservation of the Old Knowledge during the eclipse of Set. Astaroth's aesthetic function in the Diabolicon is interesting in this connection. “But this tale is the Book of Another. “ It would appear that the Book of Coming Forth by Night is meant here."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"“And those two are Nameless Ones still, dwelling in two shrines built by their own hands but sealed by me with the Words of my own Wi sdom and guarded by the mighty Goddess of the Red Desert.” The \"Goddess of the Red Desert\" is Sekh met. Like Astaroth, Sekhmet is a Neter of War, and like the early Set is a Neter both of the desert and of war. The phrase \"our Forms were often confused\" seems applicable here, alt hough it clearly has a deeper meaning. \"The Words of my own Wisdom\" would seem to point to the f act that it is not the Stele ( The Word of Set ) that is now being referred to, but rather Astaroth's own words. “But even as Astaroth comes forth, so shall the God of the Ninth Hour conduct them onward to the Pylons of the New Temple.” The \"God of the Ninth Hour\" would appear to be a reference to The Book of that which is in the Underworld or the Book of the Pylons , although I found nothing in th e relevant sections of either of those texts to be immediately helpful. The description of the Ninth Hour in the Book of the Pylons is of greater interest in this connection, but exploring that text seems to me to be straying too far afield for my immediate purposes . While there may very well be something of significance in one or both of t hose texts, I am inclined to view the \"Ninth Hour\" as referring to the traditional in terpretation of the numb er nine -- death, regeneration, and transformation. It is also possible that the \"Ninth Hour\" has an astrological sense, which would accord with the \"time being against them.\" In any case, th e reemergence of a principle of old Khem is indicated here. “You who saw their shrines, came too soon and passed by, knowing it for what it was, but knowing Not what was written there.” The knowledge did not yet exist to decipher or Understand what was written there. “I, Astaroth, shall give you the Key and the Formula -- but that An cient Text you must decipher for yourselves.” This is another indication that Astaroth's \"patience is not as Great as it was in old Khem,\" and an indication that he will not intervene too fo rcefully in the affairs of mankind. I take the \"Ancient Text\" to mean The Word of Set , and understand this to mean that the tools now exist to use it in the fullness of its Power. “In the full light of day at the threshold of the Gate of the Sou th Solstice, I, Astaroth who announced myself with a brief illumination in th e Night of the Aeon as I made my descent upon this earth like unto those distant waters, no w stand before you with my seal bearing the twin serpents of my Life and Wis dom and the sword that joins them.” Compare this passage with: And before our sight Satan lost shape and became again the essence of Lucifer, and we beheld a brilliance that infused all of Hell and sent great bolts of pr ismic light into the surrounding void. And the brilliance said, I am Lucifer rev ealed, who am the Eternal Flame. I go now to Earth, for no longer shall man be confounded in Godly ignorance. And then the brilliance"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"became as a flash of fire in the vastness of sp ace, and we knew that Satan had departed from Hell. (15) Taken directly, this pictures a movement w ithin the Aeon which is in the process of Remanifestation. “In the name of Set, the Prince of Darkness, I gi ve you my own Word to assist you on the path of Xeper.” Set is invoked to witness the gift of Astaroth. This gift is a Word, ie , a magical concept that can enhance Xeper. “That Word is MACH -- The Fire In The Darkness” MACH (pronounced mäk) is symbolically defined in the text as \"The Fire In The Darkness.\" Following are some passages which di rectly bear on this concept: Let then my eyes become the Eyes of Set, my strength become the Strength of Set, my will become the Will of Set. As a Fire in the Darkness I am Become; as Air in the Sky I am Become; as Earth in Space I am Become; as Wate r in the Desert I am Become. I dwell in the Fane of the Flame of Ba . Time bows before my Will, and I am Lord of Life, Death, and Life in Death. Hear then this Doom which I pronounce, and beware the Ka which now Comes Into Being through that Art which is mine to command. (16) I am within and beyond you, the Highest of Life, in majesty greater than the forces of the Universe; whose eyes are the Face of the Sun and the Dark Fire of Set... (17) My Word to the third ordering of life brings the fruits of deli ght to the Eart h, reflecting the brilliance of the stars and the nineteen Parts of this Word. By comprehending them they came to know their relation to the first and second orde rings, as well as the in spiration of their own creation and that deathless fire that burns through their past, present, and future. I bring this knowledge of your creation; I am with you in peace and comfort; and I entrust to you my essence, because thus are we the same. (18) MACH began not as a concept, but as an utterance. It is the Etruscan word for the number five, and the Egyptian word for fire and forg e. Assuming that the postulated association between North Etruscan and the runes is corr ect, one can profitably look at the sequence Mannaz-Ansuz-Kenaz for additional insight into this Wo rd. While I intend to explore those possible linguistic histories of this Wor d, they are of secondary importance. If the Book of Astaroth (and my interpretation of it) is valid, then the Word of Set has far greater magical importance than we generally credited it with. It is in relation to the Word of Set that I expect it the Book of Astaroth to obtain its definitive significance. At the most general level, MACH is the principl e of material creation in accordance with self- conscious Will. It is the Descent of Self-Ordered Being from the Subjective Realm into the Objective and the Ordering of the Objective. As a state of Being, it is th e crystallization (but not stasis) of Being into a Self-contained system.

Appendix I – The XemSet Working [Originally sent as a letter to Magister Robert Menschel and Priestess Marie Zajkowski on October 10, XXVIII.] Shortly after Conclave, I embarked on my own Xem Quest. My second Xem Working had some features that I w ould like to discuss. The purpose of the Working was to enter the magi cal space that had been created at XemSet."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"I typically do outdoor workings, and since we have started some new construction on the house, that area seemed a very appropriate setting for the working. Since there was no suitable surface to use as an altar, I put the Black Flame (sterno) on the edge of the bare foundation, a nd after the invocation, sat down in a chair that was placed on the opposite side of the new construction. As in the Xem Working of Magus Barrett, I almost immediately starting hearing a rustling in the tree s and bushes, followed by the sound of breaking twigs, and finally breaki ng branches, as if there were large animals in the darkness. (This was not a dreamlike state -- I was quite alert and very much aware of my physical surroundings). Recalling Magus Barrett's Worki ng, I decided that I was not going to allow myself to worry about that source of those sounds , and as soon as I adopted that attitude they vanished. Soon, the entire area between myself and the Bl ack Flame was filled with a blue mist or luminescence that blocked any view of anything except the Black Flame. I experimented with this luminescence, and found that I could easily decr ease it's density at will (no effort of will was required to return it to its original dens e state. The space between me and the Black Flame seemed elongated, and I had the sensation (and to some extent, the perception) of being simultaneously in a long stone passageway and in a forest). Very soon, the ritual began to create itself -- a very elaborate and remarkably vivid variation on the Stele of Xem, as if I were participating in a formal ritual. As I walked toward the Black Flame, led by Anubis, I was met halfway by M aat who gave me the choice of weighing my heart or turning back. After passing through th at ordeal, I was \"instr ucted\" to leave the sanctuary (my working area) and go out into th e darkness toward the pl ace where I had earlier heard the sounds, which I did. (Again, this was a choice which I was free to accept or reject). When I returned, I approached the Black Flame, where I encountered the \"Unknown Neter .\" (At first I though it was a manifestati on of Set, but it was not Set). Sitting down again, I decided to attempt to penetr ate the consciousness of Set (the majority of my Workings in the past few months have been directed toward that goal). I did not succeed in this, but heard Set telling me the method whereby it could be accomplished. Once again, I encountered the group of figures that I sensed during my first ritual as a Setian, which I have encountered many times since, a nd which we have discussed. This time they identified themselves to me as the Initiates of Xem. There was a tense moment at that point, but soon they seem satisfied and for the first time left before the ritual ended. The seemed to give me some object, but I uncertain what it was. On this occasion, I once again reaffirmed and st rengthened my link with Astaroth -- but this time it seemed definitive, and I said: \"Astaroth once again wa lks among mankind.\" With that, I had the definite sense that I had begun cha nging not only my personal universe, but the collective one. I felt called upon to ask Shuti an d Mut to witness that moment, which I did -- after which I closed the ritual. While recording the ritual, I felt calle d upon to send a written record of this Working to Shuti, and Mut which I am doing now. Despite the power of the ritual , I noticed no signs of stress, fatigue, disorientation either immediately following the ritual or the next day. I was left was a feeling of joy and power, but not euphoria or grandiosity. While, as I have sa id, I experienced the r itual as though it was being created outside of myself, I also felt tota lly in control -- it was an experience I was free"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"to participate in, but without any sense of i nner or outer compulsion. When I did choose to undergo the ordeals, however, they seemed both very real and very dangerous. Since my first Xem Working, I have occasionally felt \"out of time\" -- as if I am living simultaneously in different periods of time, the different periods of th e unfolding of the Word Xem. I will conclude with an impression that has been with since my first month in the Temple -- there is something oddly consistent in the experiences I have had, and I have the conviction that what I am doing is for not onl y a personal purpose, but a collective one as well.

It is not possible to make a small pack age of the Ageless Intelligence of the Universe, so there has to be more than honorable adjectives in That we know as Set. We may gain some insight by examining what he is not . He says that memory of the future can be ruled out, so he is not omniscient. He alone cannot preserve his Elect, so he is not omni potent. He would seem not to be omnipresent, or he would lose that singularity of oneness. He must be finite since, he not only has a distinct since of humor, but uses it. A graver indication of his being finite is that his continued existence is linked with ours in that if we fail, his Majesty will end.

But w ith this we enter a nebulous area of infinite possibilities which I wouldn't t ouch with ten feet worth of Tcham scepter. Again, what is Set? We have mentioned some of wh at he is and some of what he is not. Those have not given a neat and conc ise definition to the question.

Musings of a First Degree Consider the rock. It cannot th ink. It cannot act. It has no ab ility to produce any independent action of its own in any sense. Its only claim to im portance is the mere fact that it exists. This rock may be acted upon by outside forces, wo rn down by waves, moved by earthquakes. But by itself, it is completely at the mercy of the natural order. If it is a jewel, it is only our perception of it which gives it valu e. Alone, it is just a rock. Consider the tree. It has a rudi mentary nervous system which allo ws it to respond to stimuli. It absorbs moisture and nutrients from the soil in order to survive. Through its roots, it seeks out the most fertile soil and the most abundant wa ter supply. It grows toward the sun. Yet it too lacks the one key which sets it apart from the na tural order of the universe: it is not conscious. Only human beings possess this key. Only we can, by mere consciousness, affect the natural order. We can pick up the rock or cut down the tr ee: acts which do not fit into the flow of the natural order. And whether you wish to believe consciousness to be a twist of evolutionary fate or the act of some outside entity or force, it is inescapable to conclude that consciousness, because it denies the flow of natura l order, cannot be a part of it. What then, is consciousness? Whether you call it soul or karma, life-fo rce or vital essence, because the natural order controls all physical th ings (since all physical things constitute the natural order), consciousness cannot be part of the physical world. It, by its mere existence, proves what every sage of ever y age has longed to know: the ex istence of something outside the physical body. Setians use their consciousness as a tool. For, being our essence, we can control, focus, and refine our consciousness to whatever end we wish.

We can throw it. We can crush it. We have complete dominion in the natural order over this rock. So it is with our conscious mind. We can, by sheer will and with a little practice, aff ect anything in the natural order with our consciousness. But, just as it ta kes time for a baby to learn how to pick up that rock, we are babes in terms of conscious effort. We have l ong forgotten the agony of our first step, the first time we threw a ball, the first time we wrote our name. So it is with conscious effort: the agonizing beginning is soon passed and for gotten, but must first be endured. What, then, is the purpose of consciousness? If it is our ace-in-the-hol e, if we can break the bonds of normal evolution through conscious will , Setamorphosis, if you wish, what could we expect? If one assumes that this forced consciousness, which some may call magick, to be a growing thing, then there should be limitless pow er inside it, awaiting only our ability to control it. (I am constantly reminded at this poi nt that human beings characteristically use only about 5% of their actual mental ability -- what must lie waiting in that other 95%?) If we can assume there is no limit, then many im possibilities become possibilities. First, there is no reason to die. Our consciousness can mere ly stop the slow deterioration of our bodies (death being one of those subjects which stil l baffles science for an absolute reason). Here I arrive at Set, who, as Setians believe, provided us with conscious ness in the first place. (I strictly avoid the term \"Gift\" for reasons of argument to follow. ) If he gave it to us, it would be logical to assume there was a reason. While we might assume he was bor ed at that point, or was mad at the other angels (who controlled the natural order), these w ould be illogical. Why not give consciousness to plants ... or planets for that matter? We can only guess at the reason. But let me mention one possibility. Rough estimates place the number of human beings who have lived an d died in the past at 75 billion. If we can correctly assume that they were all conscious beings, we may conclude that their conscious minds did not die (not being part of the natura l order and therefore not subject to its laws). Whether they went to heaven or hell, purgato ry or Podunk, is inconse quential. The fact is, they still exist. Why then would Set, in his wisdom, be interested in our conscious selves when he has all those other 75 billion minds in and around his place of existence? Could it be we can do things they can't? If so, there is only one reason w hy: we have physical bodies, and neither they nor Set do. After all, if he need ed something done, one would think that Set would have enough power (after a few billion year s of existence) to accomplish it himself. Could it be that we are being ta ught how not to die? Are we part of some great cosmic plan where we, by still being encased in our phys ical bodies, can alter something otherwise inevitable? What are the limits of magical pow er? If there are any, our physical existence would put us in control of them. Are we to cont rol the universe? Are we to control all planes of existence, both conscious and non-consciou s? Are we, perhaps, the protectors of the universe from destruction? Or are we its destroyers? At this point, your guess is as good as mine. "},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"The Initial Visitation - A \"Real\" Set Experience As a short prelude, I would like to mention certai n pertinent information on which this story is based. On August 8, XIV I was recognized officially as Coming Into Being as a Priest of Set. In the months prior to my rec ognition I felt all sorts of strange feelings th at spanned the range of human and non-human emotions . There were times when I felt as though I would have to get out of the Temple of Set altogether. The time that we all spent together at Set-I and the resultant exposure helped allow me the open tr ansition in my Self. When I first became a Priest, I thought I had been in contact with Set on a few different occasions. However, the experience I went through on September 9,XIV pers uaded me I had really just met Set for the first time. Hence, in the title of this st ory I make reference to the first real and active meeting between Set and me. On that night, I had decided to study my III° Stele of Xeper. I prepared for bed, and around 11:30 p.m. I took out my Stele and the written acc ount of its history which had been prepared by the Ipsissimus when he was Magus. After c ontemplating the Stele a nd the explanation of it for a while, I decided to leave th at information out on my desk overnight (my desk doubles as my Altar) and put up the Pentagram of Set fo r reinforcement. I anticipated thought on the Stele while I would drift off to sleep. I turned out my lights and drif ted into meditation. I believe the actual experience began when in my contemplation I was concentrating on the approaching Set. The last physical waking moment I recall is when I fe lt \"tingly\" after my contemplations. I pick up now from where the active experience began. I was in what I thought to be a hotel room (I soon recognized it to actually be my own bedroom). It was fairly dark, and as I looke d about I began to recognize my furnishings. I anticipated that one or more Setians would soon be with me. And as though appearing from \"thin air\" where the door enters my apartment, were Magistra Sinclair and Priestess Reynolds. (Again, I was thinking that I wa s in a hotel and how nice it was to be thus visited.) They both greeted me telepathically at the door and the th ree of us went back to where my bed/couch was pulled out into a bed (which was so because I had retired there fo r contemplation),and we sat down on the bed. I got the impression from Lilith, and it was part icularly strong, that \"tonight would be the night\" for the event to happen (to me). The three of us travelled around a bit within the confines of my apartment and they showed me a letter, which was signed in black felt pen the \"Prince of Darkness.\" They then le t me read this letter and at th e time I could see the contents thereof very clearly. I only va guely recall that it had somethi ng to do with the way in which the Prince of Darkness would be perceived in the future, and also something of my Self. (upon waking, I could not recall any more of it.) It was communicated to me that they (Magistra Sinclair and Priestess Reynolds) had to leave, but the letter woul d be left with me Classification: V2 - A47.E - 1 Author: Robertt W.

Before turning to face them to gesture farewell, they had vanished. I was disturbed by that, and could not recall them leaving. I felt more blackness engulf me, and felt a very powerful presence. I shrugged it off for a moment and (again the hotel asso ciation), thinking I had not been too hospitable, I decided to try to reach Magistra Sinclair and Priestess Reynolds and invite them to stay in my \"hotel\" room. I felt that Presence again, and was apprehensive about how I was being drawn into it. I imagined I picked up a phone and dialed \"5\" - as though this were the front desk of a hotel. On the other end of the phone came the answer, \"S ervice.\" As I tried to listen to the number I was being told to dial, the room became char ged with activity and I felt the presence all around me. Trying to seek a diversion (to escape my feeling of fright), I imagined calling my grandmother. As I was talking to her, I s uddenly reached a point where I could no longer speak. I was being drawn into communication, I could not move nor avoid my calling. The entity Set was manifesting their(?) Presence. Not so much visually as felt. I was drawn toward the letter previously left for me. I took it into one of my hands and attended Set. My \"etheric\" head was turned to face the expanse of the apartment. Set was nearby.I think I tried to approach but could not. The letter I wa s holding had to do with that which the Prince of Darkness would tell and show me. He(?) was s eated on a throne-like ch air. He rose slowly with scepter in one hand. He \"t old\" me that the letter (and so me sort of visual impression I was receiving) was the way that he, Set, woul d be/was/is to be known to Mankind. He assured me that there could be no other way. He said it was part of my task as well. The Essence was awesome. I was drawn and then floated to my kitchen table to be further addressed by him. He told me of his sword-handli ng ability (a diversion?). The dark form that was Set asked me if I could hear the blade of the scimitar behind me . I could hear it coming from a corner of the room, and knew it was suspended by Set's power in the air. The sound of it shimmered. He then began to move the sword through the space in my apartment. He floated and moved with it. I showed fear, and thinking I could turn on the lights of my apartment, tried and failed. I kept thinking that the electricity was dead. I was frozen in my bed in a relaxed position as Set passed the phantom of the scimitar directly ove r my body. At that point I became very intense and shocked myself back into the \"physical. \" I awoke and jotted the whole experience down. The following day, after work, while I was comp osing the long description from my notes, I called Amon DeCecco and told him the story. An interesting note: in the morning when I aw oke both the Stele and ex planation sheet were in the dresser drawer where I keep Setian materi als.

For this my admiration and love have been made known. We have traversed a long and hard road in fo llowing the second Magus. We have fought and we have won.

Rejoice in the Black Flame, for in this fire you will find my heart and my love, the radiant beams which will indeed bring you comfort and warmth and the power needed to endure. Xeper For my own sake and for the sakes of any others who read this, I will make this commentary as simple as possible. To do this I will go by paragraphs. 1) The first paragraph deals with the initial ha tred by followers of the Right Hand Path of all things that are different, hence the phrase about the face and name, the name being that of \"Satan\", the Hebraic accuser, and the face bei ng that of a horned and ugly devil, even though the Bible states that \"Satan\" was the most b eautiful of angels under the name \"Lucifer.\" 2) Set does not strike me as a braggart, but he does have a great deal of power, as do we. The gift of the Black Flame to the elect would be him sharing this power. As it states in the Ninth Solstice Message , “ In giving man conscious life, we of the Daimonic race empowered him to order our death. Had Satan's gift been cast as ide -- whether from ignor ance or fear -- Satan himself and all who were wrought from him would face decline and dissolution. ” 3) I would take this to mean not only the recent attacks on the Temple, but on all of the followers of the Left Hand Path through the ages. Some groups have been torn out of existence. Others have stood and fought. But always the Black Magicians survive. 4) Actually, if there was a Magus Crowley, Magus LaVey, and Magus Aquino, there are of course actually three Magi. But Set does not recognize the Aeon of Ha rWer, and so I must then assume that Magus LaVey is the first Ma gus, and Magus Aquino (now an Ipsissimus) is the second. I see this road that we must travel as raw survival. Humanity seems to want to destroy itself through hatred and war. I believe th is is where Remanifestation comes into play. 5) This passage sounds like more of a warni ng to become ready, again with immortality, and also the formula of the Aeon. This would lead me to believe that only through the use of both of these major words, Xeper and Remanifest , compounded by the Formula, can we hope to survive. 6) This would seem to be a differently worded version of the Ninth Part of the Word of Set , which is truthful, no matter how it is worded. 7) When christians try to pray for us, realiz ing that we don't care what they do, they become nasty and attack us. Why? Because we are different. 8) Set now frees the face of \"Evil,\" and gives it back to the lord of christian deception. He now shows himself as the first among night, \"The Price of Darkness.\" As far as the corruption of the Pentagram of Set goes, I do not think that I could top those words. 9) The pope of the vatican in Rome dresses in white light splendor, while those that he commands live in poverty. The word \"Bard\" mean s a poet/singer. In this context it means singer, and two come to mind: Michael Jacks on and Whitney Houston. If these two would put"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"more of their finances into wo rld hunger instead of elaborate c oncerts to sing about it, this would be a happier world. 10) Of course when one white-light god fails yo u, you go to another one, right? That's logic. 11) See The Satanic Bible , in the forward written by Burt on H. Wolfe, regarding Magus LaVey's experiences as a police photographer. 12) Even though it is too bad about all of the problems in the wo rld, if we are to survive we must look to ourselves and to our fellow magicians in the Temple of Set.

Secondly, this commentary is not interlinear, but instead is drawn from the understanding reached as a result of study encompassing all f our of the documents mentioned, as well as the Book of Coming Forth by Night . Occasional references may/will be made to specific lines, sentences, or words. It will be helpful to you if you set all four documents before you for referral. Now we begin ... The odd-numbered Sonnets are much more vague than the even-numbered Sonnets, leaving more material for the Initiate to search out and find for himself, though the even-numbered Sonnets have less than obvious statements contai ned within them also. This is more easily seen when all six of the curren tly existing Sonnets are viewed together. The IAM, of course, is filled with hidden a nd half-hidden material. But who made the statements in the four docum ents that Anubis and I have been fortunate enough to receive? Set? One of Se t's aspects like HarWer, Anubis, or even his Gift - the Black Flame? To all of these questions I feel the answ er is a resounding YES. All or any one of the aspects may be speaking within a single document. Change . More than anything else, the documents d eal with change. Philosophical, Magickal, personal, historical change.

In Sonnet I, Verse 1, I initially thought the references to \"lost\" and \"found\" to mean the period of time during which the death glorification cu lts overshadowed the Glory of Set, and Set's eventual reemergence and proclamation of the Aeon. While I do not believe this to be in error, I now feel it is a rather supe rficial understanding. The line mo re correctly deals with the losing, regaining, and development of th e Black Flame and Xeper to Xem.

Should we fail in this effort, the Ma jesty of Set \"shall fade and be ended.\" Among other things, the IAM is a testament to the difficu lty and variety of the task now set before us (pun intended). The Black Flame - the Gift of Set - is within us , and we are not to seek it \"outside your bodies and your minds.\" Only by realizing our DUAL natures, recognizing and Working with the Black Flame to strengthen and intensify our Magical Being, and keeping all elements in balance as we reach new, and higher, levels of development, can we realistically expect to achieve the level of Higher Man.

They be long neither to the realm of man, nor to the realm of Set exclusively. While a Priest may have knowle dge and Know (reason), he does not yet Understand; hence he is in a state of Madness, continually bouncing b ack and forth between the levels of being. 2) God-Man: Destined Sanity: Magistri In the IV° level of development, the Intellect and Will are no longe r anchored in the realms of man but have instead shifted to the higher, more complex level of the realm of Set. A Master may \"visit\" the realm of man, but it is always a conscious effort on th eir part to do so. A Master no longer TRIES to Understand - he simply Understands. An exercise of Will becomes Result. A Master applies . The IAM, of course, contains many references to the Magickal evolution and eventual Coming into Being of an Initiate. Here I will change the format of this presentati on, so that I might more easily relate each of the three Sonnets to the IAM. The last two paragraphs of the IAM and the entire first Sonnet seem to complement each other. The references to \"IAM and those who use ME,\" as well as verses 2 through 7 of the first Sonnet, all make allusions to the Black Flame and the wonder of those who can learn to"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"use the Gift as it was intended. Much of the re st of the IAM is a r ecounting of the various Forms that it is possible the Magickian may en counter or Become, as he evolves to the one Form he may have a special affinity for. As I said earlier, the IAM also mentions the difficulty of this task. The Forms the Magickian may em ploy may already be recognized and generally understood, or he may find it necessary to create new Forms spontaneously, or by the combination of existing Forms. The results can be expressed as 1 = 1; and X · 1 = X 1 ; and 3! = X, respectively. The second Sonnet relates to that part of the IAM that mentions how IAM has been in contact with the Elect of the past as well as of the present, and the lessons IAM sought to impart to them. IAM also let it be known in the second Sonnet that the evolution of the Magickian will be a personal thing, and that we should Work toward th e goal of the process, without concern as to how we are viewed by others of the Elect. This I explain as the necessity of each of us, the Elect, to Xeper to Xem in possibly divergent me thods to parallel ends. One Initiate may Xeper in a method that may not work for another. As the Forms differ, so too may the methods. IAM will understand, \"for I am not masked, and my eyes see the Truth.\" It might even come to pass that some Initiates shall mani fest \"destructive\" Forms. Sonnet III completes the equations I mentioned above, and warns that Uttering the new Word before the completion of the previous, established Word will not easily be Understood, but the new Word is defined as an extension rather than a replacement of the previous Word. Just as the IAM recognizes that \"now is always the beginning,\" so too does the third Sonnet make that recognition and promises that \"Now shall my Word, Become.\" There is much more material contained with in the IAM and the first three Sonnets. This presentation has been more or less a capsule ve rsion of what I see in the future documents. Poem and Commentary Poem I am He who Is. Classification: V4 - A47.M - 5 Author: Lynn A.

Commentary Although \"He\" is never mentioned by name, I believe \"He\" to be Set. To me, the terms \"lost\" and \"dead\" refer to the long inte rim of time between Set's heyday in Egypt and to the present. The fact tbat He is \"again\", I believe refers to the Temple of Set. The \"Man-Gods which lost me, and made me not alive...\" refers to the accep tance of the Osiris faith and its resulting neo- self-sacrifice-death-and-day-o f-judgement offspring, with us Setians \"that found me, and made me live again,\" shelving such claptrap fo r the acceptance of Set. The next two stanzas warn us, all Setians, against an thropomorphosizing Set. Concept - yes; personality - no. The next line, \"For all that was...\" seems self-expl anatory.

Set Communion Ritual At some point every Satanist or Setian will want to contact the Dark Lord. Unfortunately there are few simple, good ritual s for doing this, and many are derived from our (sometimes) infamous past, where the enthusiasm of the creators might have gotten the better of them. Of course, many of the well known Black rituals we re written by Christian clergy who tortured innocent people into describing th ese lurid fantasies for the benefit of the inquisition. Obviously, Many of the Gothic ritual s aren't appropriate for modern people or society. I decided that it woul d be best to write my own. Classification: V2 - A47.RI - 1 Author: Shell Runar I° Date: August 4, XXIV HTML Revision: Dec 22, 1998 CE Subject:  Ritual  Magic  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"My original ritual was read and critiqued by Magister Menschel, who made numerous recommendations, but in particular suggested th at I expand it. This I did. Instead of coming up with a single ritual however, I wrote an out line which could be used as a basic guideline for constructing several different rituals. Th e following revision owes much to Magister Menschel's insights and advice. The Set Communion Ritual is based primarily on Setian ideas as derived from Egyptian scholars. In this sense, it's not Satanic, though it could easily be modified by a creative magician. Technically it's similar to the classica l invocation of Ceremonial magic, but differs in one vital way. Instead of attempting to invoke the deity to enter, or possess the consciousness of the magician, this only invites Set to enter the Temple that is prepared. 1. Introduction • Background: I feel that there are tw o goals to Greater Black Magic. One is to gain personal power through ch anging the world around the magician. This is done on the empirical level through subjec tive manipulation of the inner realms and consciousness. Through ritual a merging of th is refined inner paradigm with the outer can be accomplished. The second goal is direct contact with the Da rk Lord. I feel that contacting the Dark Lord is the more important of the two, as this communion with him will facilitate greater ability in gaining pow er. Through instruction from Set, the magician can attain proficiency in the Black Arts, transformati on of the inner consciousness, knowledge of the mundane and transmundane world, a nd understanding of Self and Will. • Purpose: This Ritual is a ne ophyte rite to contact Set. I am assuming that it is possible to reach and commune with the Dark Lord. I believe that this is possible by creating the right atmosphere within a Temple setting, and a proper state of mind within th e neophyte. The ritual is kept as open and simple as possible to make it easy to change as n eeded, and to allow for spontaneous work within the rite. At the same time I have attempted to be thorough and precise in my research. • Expectations: Unknown. I have read of direct contact in which the Dark Lord can actually be heard, or contacted in dreams or trance. It's also po ssible that a simple transformation of the magician's life will occur: strange coincide nces, new contacts, good fortune. It will be vital to keep a careful and detailed Magical Diary. 2. Setting • Audio: The audio tape will be an environmental one. It can either start with a quite, meditative sound of the desert and then gr ow in intensity with the accumulation of animal noises, or start with animal sounds and then quiet down. The tape can be made from taping the sounds of animals at the zoo, but it would be prefer able to tape them in the wild. One method is to watch nature shows and edit the sounds."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"o Sounds of the desert: wind, storms, lightening. o Sounds of animals sacred to Set, like the Ass, Crocodile, Hippo. o Sounds of all desert animals o Sounds of any wild animals o Alternative: Modern classical music, full of energy and dissonance, can supplant the animal sounds. Another type is Ambient Industrial which is a style similar to Electronic Space music, but with clangorous, complex sounds. This should be homemade, and is the eas iest to produce as it simply means recording Radio noises, Shortwave, c ity environmental sounds, TV audio of noises, and then processing them to make them less recognizable. The result is a collage of otherworldly ambience. • Visual o Surroundings  Desert: The desert is one of the trad itional spaces of Set. It represents the wild and untamed land, as well as the source of great power and strength. It is a symbol of the empty spaces where the adept will face his inner Shadows and Demons, a symbol for the Abyss. It is traditional among many cultures for magicians and mystics to seek communion with the greater spirits in the desert. The ritual should be performed there if possible. In this instance, the best time would be in the Solar Equinox and at the Full Moon.  Wilderness: Set is also the Neter of the wilderness in general, and any wild spaces. This is an al ternative to the desert. It should be as far from civilization as possible.  Ocean: Set is also known as the Neter of the oceans, which are wild and unpredictable. The ritual can be done at the oceanside, especially during a good storm. (Caution must be exercised in this case as it could be dangerous if the waves overtake the magician.) It could also be done on a remote island combining both the wilderness and the ocean. In this instance it is th e Apep nature of Set we are trying to evoke.  Temple: A simple Temple can be set up in the desert. If the desert or wilderness can't be found, then the Te mple can be created in the adept's home. There are two possible environments to make. One is very hot, representing the breath of Set. This can be done with heated rocks, or a portable heater. The other is cold, whic h is the desert at night. Set was supposed to represent the storms, a nd the cold night; anything that covered the sun of RA. In this instance it would be efficacious to visualize Set as the Apep Serpent wh o devoured the Light. In this case the ritual would be best performed in the dead of winter and at the New Moon."},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":" Darkness: The darkness of night is a doorway into the mysteries of existence. It is a symbol of Apep, the serpent who devours the sun, Set, and all other manifestations of the Dark Lord. o Temple setup  Spirits, especially Daemonic ones, are traditionally supposed to enter our world through angles and points. Sin ce this is a Ritual to invite Set in, a polygon is used. Crowley chose th e triangle in Liber 418 and this proved efficacious. The magician should be in a triang le, big enough to be comfortable and to hold the necessary tool s. In the case of a dese rt setting, the triangle could be made large enough for considerable movement, like dancing. One point should face south, the direc tion of Set. Alternatively it can face the constellation of the Great B ear, associated with Set, or the country Egypt. Another alternative is to try a Trapezoid with the short side facing south. It can be designed with rope, drawn in the sand or dirt, or drawn with chalk. Another possibility is to make a Iron triangle la rge enough to sit on. The base of Heaven was allege d to have been made of Iron, implying that divinity rested on Set. It could also be implied by the position of the candles.  There will be three candles, one at each corner. If outdoors, lamps can be used. If more lights are need, then nine is an appr opriate number.  There can be a truncated pyramid around the magician. This symbolizes the primal hill/temple arising from the Chaos waters. It was a place where life was preserved for eternity. This will be formed by four trapezoids leaning inward. Each can be of different shapes, but should meet at the corners. It can be made from any lightweight material, painted appr opriately, or cloth strung on ropes to form the pyramid. An alternative is to string silver ropes to suggest the edges of the pyramid. A last alternative is to form a trapezoid over the head of the magician.  There should be a symbol of Set. This can be a statue or an icon like the Reversed Pentagram, or Utchat Eye facing left.  An altar can be used to hold the Sacred Tools. It should be small enough to fit in the triangle with th e magician. It can be pure black, or black with a red pentagram or Set animal painted on it. The Magician can design his own Lamen and use this instead, but it should be Setian for this ritual. o Symbols, tools  Wand: The Wand is the symbol of the magicians Will and a symbol of the Baptism of Fire."},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"It represents his determination and co mmitment to Setian principles, as well as his connection with his inner powers. The Baptism of Fire is the Divine Gnosis of the Dark Lord descending, the downward point of the Triangle in Tantra, the point of the Pe ntagram in Black Magic. It can be of a traditional straight Black W ood, carved with Setian symbols. The Flail and the Crook, symbols of the Pharaoh's authority, can be substituted.  Cup: The Cup is the representation of the reservoir of Power, the female aspect of the Dark Lord, a nd the subconscious of the magician. This is the realm of the inner Demons, the Shadows. The Cup connects the outer Fire Ocean of Set with th e inner Dark realm of the adept.  Dagger: The Dagger represents the in tellect of the magician. With its keen edge it cleanly cuts through ig norance and intellectual laziness. It protects its user from the forces of slavery and oppression, from those who would limit his freedom. This is one of the Gifts of Set. Usually flint daggers were used fo r sacred purposes since they were made without human hands. Crescen t shaped ones represented the power of the Moon. Iron should be us ed as sacred to Set. Copper, because it is red, can also be used.  Pantacle: The Pantacle symbolizes Earth, the foundation and strength of the magician. Here is where he draws his stamina from, and builds his Temple on. The magician plants the seeds of possibility in the Earth, from it he draws energy to make his Will manifest. It can be made from red or black clay, wood, or from Iron. It should have the symbols of Set carved or painted on it.  Staff: This was the Uas-Septre and represented the power of the Pharaoh. It was shaped in the form of the Set animal.  Scarab: Symbol of the Khepra beetle. It represented self-creation and is therefore a good symbol for Set. The Khepra beetle was also a desert animal, the domain of Set. \"I have soared as the primeval one soars: I have become Kephri. I have grown as the plants grow, I am the fruit of every God\".  Ring: It is a symbol of eternity. Ge nerally it was closed with a knot. In the shape of a Serpent it represents Apep and could be used in a Draconian ceremony. It should be made in material conducive to the ceremony, like silver.  Sistrum: This instrument had three or four rods with rattles that often had the form of a Serpent. The meta l hoops represented the orbit of the moon, the tow face as Isis (life) and Nepthys (death), and the rods as the four elements.  Lotus Flowers: This was a symbol of Upper Egypt. It was a representation of the divinity aris ing from the primordial Chaos and was close to both forces of darkne ss and light. It became a symbol of rebirth."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":" Fragrance: The Gods have a divine scent, and it was used to represent everlasting life.  Red Carnelian: This jewel became a symbol for life and victory. Its color it was especially associated with Set.  Reversed Pentagram: Symbols of th e Dark Lord. The descent of the Gnosis into the human consciousness. The uniting of the Divine, Set, with the magician's Will, creating a new being.  Book: The Book of Coming Forth by Night , and the Word of Set . Appropriate passages can be read from it.  Candles: Black if possible, or red.  Food: Desert fruits: dates, cactus.  Water: Ocean water would be good in this case, or perhaps water collected off the desert plants in the morning.  Robe: Black, hooded if possible. Si mple and plain as symbol of openness to new ideas and transformation. 3. Preparation • General Work: The magician should familiarize himself or herself with the nature of Set. Study, correspondence, and dialogue are good means to become familiar with the Dark Lord. This can take considerable ti me, perhaps months of preparation. While it may not be necessary to become of scholar about information on the Dark Lord, it is efficacious to have some conception in mind before attempting contact. • Contacts: Contacting other Seti ans, Satanists, or any magicians who walk the Left Hand Path, will be useful in creating the proper emotional and mental atmosphere for invoking Set. • Dream Work: One useful method to facilitate contact is to cont emplate the ritual before going to sleep, working out the rites me ntally. Often this will lead to interesting dreams. Also it may help the magician to \"wake up\" in the dream state, as the magician realizes he or she has been working on this before going to sleep. • Tools: The tools should be collected and pr epared carefully, with the Dark Lord in mind while searching for the right ones. It is important to create the appropriate magical link with each tool. • Time: The best time for the ritual is midnight. By the Full Moon and the summer equinox for the Fiery Neter, New Moon and wi nter equinox for the for the Draconic. • Temple: The primary choice for the Ritual is in nature, so the Temple should be simple, portable, and quick to set up. If it is necessary to perform the rite indoors, the ritual sp ace can be more elaborate, but the goal of the this ritual is to make a s pontaneous and natural link with the Dark Lord, and as this is an inner process di stractions should be minimized. • Setian Desert ritual: The primary natural aspect of Set is as the Neter of the desert. In order to create the proper atmosphere it is efficacious to make the Temple as much like the desert as possible. The Magi cian can prepare by visiting a hot dry environment, Saunas, or even turning up the heat and meditating on the fiery nature of Set. Sand can be scattered on the floor and an incense that evokes the atmosphere of the desert could be used. Meditation outdoor s can be done around a large charcoal fire. The ritual itself can take place in a ny of these environments as well."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"• Apep Ocean ritual: Another aspect of Set is of the Neter of the wild and rebellious oceans. Often Set is associated with Apep in the aspect. The magician can prepare for a ritual like this by meditating on the Serpen t nature of Set while at the ocean, or a wild river. A ritual can also be conducted in these envir onments, but they should be as far from people as possible. 4. Ritual Opening • Atmosphere o Candles or lamps should be lit. o Scents: Appropriate scents, like Lotus a nd desert, or smells of the sea should be lit. If outdoors, this won't necessary. o Music: Start the music, quiet at first with growing volume. At the crescendo the magician should read from the Book of Coming Forth by Night . • Meditation: The magician should begin with a meditation on the nature of Set. Try to create a communion or contact. • Opening of the Gate: The magician should be sitting. A common form of Set portrays him standing with the right arm raised, the ot her lowered and the left foot forward. It is also said in Egyptian writings that the Ph araoh is Set while he is sitting. Combining the two seems the best choice. In this case we have the magician seated cr oss legged, with the left arm raised, for the energy of the left hand path, and the ot her lowered. This makes the connection between the greater spiritual essences and th e physical. It also is depicted in the ancient carvings and drawings of the Great Horned God, and the Devil in the Tarot deck. The Opening of the Gate is simple. The magi cian will demand that the Guardian of the Abyss throw open the doors to the Dark R ealm. The magician can envision a fiery land of powerful and fecund energies for the pr imal aspect of Set, or deep, dark and stygian for Apep. • Reading from the Book of Coming Forth by Night : An appropriate passage should be chosen before starting the ritual. The magici an should be familiar with it and have it memorized if possible. The magician could re ad the first half in the opening ritual and the second half in closing. 5. Main Rite • Invitation to Set: The main rite will begin with an invitation to Set. This makes the time and space prepared by the magician ava ilable for Set's presence. The magician can offer devotion and dedication to the prin ciples of Set, and a commitment to his personal growth. This should be simple and sincere rather than formal. The magician should makes his or her goals known at this point. • Wand: The magician hold up the Wand and thank Set for the Fire of his Will, the primal force of his being. • Cup: The magician will hold the Cup and tha nk Set for the gift of renewing power and the reservoir of the unconscious mind from wh ich he draws his inner strength. He will drink in honor of the inner Demons and the Dark Lord."},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"• Dagger: The magician will hold up the dagger in thanks for the gift of intelligence that sets him apart from the ignorant mass of hu manity, and the blind self-slavery of the oppressed. • Pantacle: The magician will hold up the Pantac le in honor of Set's strength rooted in his contact with the empirical, and his comm itment to the inhabitants of the physical Universe and his willingness to commune with them. 6. Close • Reading from the Book of Coming Forth by Night • Closing thanks: The magician should thank th e Dark Lord for coming, even if it's not obvious he was there. The magician may not be able to experience Set yet, except in indirect means, so success should not be judged solely on obvious immediate experience. • Meditation: The magician should meditate on the ritual and carefully collect any thoughts or feelings he might have had. • Put out lights and scents • Put away tools • Close Temple: The magician should close th e Temple in a formal and specific manner. This insures the sanctuary of the sacred space created. It can be closed with a simple word or gesture like \"It is done\". Is HarWer Man? Classification: V2 - A48.01 - 1 Author: James L.

Hear these sounds, for I speak with a Pure Heart: I Will that We shall Become as One. My Self watched the Maati materialize in the Hall, then approached them. As I approached the two Maati, the double aspects of the Goddess Maat, I became as One with Them. Almost instantly I was able to R ealize/Recognize/Unders tand the Truth which I sought: Man the species is not HarWer, whose Aeon began in th e year 1904 CE and ended in the year 1966 CE (I AES). Rather, the objective universal aspect of Man the species may be likened to Set's HarWer aspect -- the material, objective aspe ct of Man is: truly f itful and unpredictable ... simply look at the present state of society a nd you will see that positive changes, i.e.: those not destructive in the long run, began only afte r 1966 CE. The Elect must liken their Selves with Set, i.e.: Recognize /Create their \"HarWer\" aspect to de fine the Self and thereby Become a God/dess. (This was further substantiation of what was pe rceived in the G.B.M. Rite \"Emulation.\") I was suddenly thrust from the two Maati, throu gh the Hall, then back into the \"main House\" of Maat, in which the Hall of the Maati is locate d. I then passed back through the Gate guarded by Anubis, at which time I called A nubis to close and bolt the Gate. Next, I found that I had reentered my chamber. [Period of Contemplation:] During this time in my chamber the Golden Maat figurine upon my altar became animated: part of the head became dark and in the darkness appeared two fiery-golden eyes. I spoke to the Entity, subcons ciously questioning Its reality. The hair on the back of my neck suddenly stood on end, then an envelope many, many feet from the altar flew from the shelf where it lay. Next, the \"hair-sta nding\" feeling moved up the back of my head and around to my face, which immediately flus hed. I no longer harbored subconscious doubts as to the Entity's reality. From that point forward I kept my eyes fixe d on the fiery eyes in the Maat figurine and carried on a conversation with the Entity. The re sult of this conversation was a decision to write my own analysis of Blasting Forth by Day or Night , regarding the statement by Magister Menschel that HarWer is Man the spec ies, then submit it to Magister Menschel for comment with the Understanding of a Magister Templi. [Extinguished Flame. [Sounding of bell -- same as in step 5, supra . [Ended Rite by saying:] So It Is Done And So It Shall Be!

The results of the July 12 rite were : 1) Man the species is not HarWer; and 2) Man is to find his own personal \"HarWer\" aspect. Magister Menschel asserts the message Blasting Forth by Day or Night was delivered by the God HarWer. I can see no reason to dispute that claim, and therefore accept the contents of that message as being valid. Now, having said that..."},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"HarWer is not Man, the species. \"Child of the Universe...\" (2) Notice that \"Universe\" is capitalized. This denotes the totality of existence, rather than either the objective or subjective. (3) Yet, Set created HarWer to oppose the Cosmic order. (4) Therefore if man the species were in fact HarWer, then man could not be truly Setian, as Man's sole purpose would be to constantly oppose the Cosmic order that Set could exist, and \"Universe\" would not be capitali zed in the above passage. To substantiate the claim that HarWer is in fact making a distinction between the Universe and the objective universe, we need only point to the last sent ence in paragraph 5, page 1: \"Join me as we nullify the Cosmic Inertia; be free of this uni verse's laws.\" Notice that \"universe\" is not capitalized in this passage. More over, notice the difference in \"the Universe\" from the first passage we looked at and \"this universe\" in the last passa ge from which we read. Now, if Man is not HarWer, then what is he? He is a Being with the potential to Become Divine, i.e.: to Become a God/dess. (5) In the July 12 Working I say Man (the Elect) must liken his Self to Set and do as Set did: Man must Recognize (create) his own \"HarWer\" aspect . How? Seek and find the inconsistency and irrationality. (6) Set himself describes HarWer as \"inconsistent and irrational.\" Truth there was in the words of my Opposite Self, but a truth ever tinged with the inconsistency and irrationality of which I have spoken. (7) Therefore, the \"inconsistency and irrationality\" which we ar e to seek and find is HarWer . Yet, the HarWer for which we are seeking to find is not the HarWer, rather, it is our own individual \"HarWer\" aspects . The next question is: Where are we to begin the search for our \"HarWer\" aspect? Look to your personal objecti ve universal existen ce and activities. It is well-established already that HarWer functions as opposi tion to the Cosmic (objective) Inertia. It therefore stands to reason that one's personal \"HarWer\" aspect would serve the same purpose. Have you never acted inconsistently or irrationall y? Have you never acted out in a fitful way? Have you never been rebellious against the no rm? If you're reading th is, then I'll bet the answer to each of those questi ons is an astounding \"YES!\" Presuming the \"YES!\" answer to the que stions above, now ask your Self: \"Why?\" Am I taking you back to square one? Absolutely not. What I just did was to point you in the direction of your own personal \"H arWer\" aspect. It's up to you to find it. 1. 2. 3."},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"4. 5. 6. 7.

HarWer: A Study Before I begin a formal analysis and commentary on the above message, 1 I should present some background, including the development of my theories concerning HarWer. HarWer is perhaps the biggest enigma within the Temple of Set's ma ny areas of study. Set introduces HarWer very early in The Book of Coming Forth by Night: 2 I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe. I created HarWer that I might define my Self. All other gods of all other times and nations have been created by men. We know of only two beings in this universe not created by men. HarWer is one of these, created directly by Set. HarWer is mentioned several times in the Book of Coming Forth by Night , each time giving us just enough information about HarWer to ge nerate more questions about this mysterious being. In the BoCFbN Analysis and Commentary , Dr. Aquino (first as Magus, and later as Ipsissimus) discussed HarWer, Hor (or Horus), and the history of this god. But even Dr. Aquino was not able to fully explain HarWer . HarWer remained and remains a topic of interest for quite a few Setians, myself included."},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"Anubis also was interested in HarWer. Priest Ba rrett reports that he looked for HarWer in The Xem Working , and could not find him. Priest Barrett's attention was then directed to other things. My impression is that Ha rWer was intentionally excluded from The Xem Working . This might imply that while HarWer must exist, perhaps HarWer is not associated with Xem, and that HarWer may be or may become relative ly unimportant as we approach Xem. Perhaps HarWer has no association to Xeper. Perhaps HarWer's existence is and will forever be unimportant to the Elect. But Set gave us curiosity, and Anubis felt HarWer to be important enough to warrant much of the third Key of The Book of Opening the Way . My interest in HarWer peaked in XVII, spurre d by my study of the third Key. The subject of HarWer had appeared in print several times be tween the years X and XVII, but nowhere had I read comments like those in the third Key. And nowhere else is the subject of HarWer given the importance that Anubis gives to HarWer in the third Key. While reading that key for the first few times, in preparation for writi ng a commentary on that Key, I found myself perplexed at Anubis' statements concerning HarWer. The third Key proposes that the Great Ones of the first Temple brought into being Xem, and that: The greatest of them he [Set] chose through w hom he would define his Self. ... He was Great Har or Hor; HarWer -- the Principle of Majestic Man. This Key then equates HarWer to Exalted/Ma jestic Man, he who wears the Double Crown. It goes on to claim that Dr. Aquino is now HarW er manifest, \"that awesome Principle Come Into Being.\" HarWer alone was created by Set. It did not seem reasonable to me that HarWer would then be a man, no matter how great. Nor did it seem reasonable to me that Michael Aquino should be equated with HarWer. Neither Set nor the universe need bow to my reason, and Magus Barrett's words might be truth, but I could not accept them without serious investigation and analysis. This question was important enough to me that I began an intensive study and research into our writings on HarWer. Following this study, I delved into my im agination to find a scenario where HarWer could be created during the tim e of ancient Egypt, a scenario where Magus Barrett's vision could be true: I envisioned a dual Set/HarWer entity, which ra ised man from animal. In time, the First Temple arose; the great Priests, through their Xeper, created and became the Great Ones, the Neters. They created Xem. The greatest of these, the Ipsissimus Hor, served as the clay from which Set created HarWer, leaving Set to Be independently. I then examined this scenario and compared it against what we know about HarWer. The scenario's probability of accuracy suffered during this study."},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"HarWer is always Set's Opposite (always capitalized) Self. Less antagonistic words could have been used, such as 'complimentary'. Antagonism is further implied by the way Set talks about HarWer and the Aeon of Horus. Would Set be so antagonistic to that Great One who so greatly served the Great Work? This implied antagonism led me along several lines of thought, each of which laid another grain of salt on the scales: 3 The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equi nox of the common year 1966, when HarWer and Set were Fused as one composite being. I could grant that a human Ipsissimus Hor/Ha rWer, a true Pharaoh, could survive physical death. I could grant that this Being might lead Crowley in Thelema. I could even grant the possibility of antagonism devel oping between the two beings. But I had difficulty envisioning a 'fusion' of this HarWer with Set during the Age of Satan. Would Set fuse again with a once-human Opposite he apparently found so distasteful? Once fused, could they then separate cleanly again in year X? According to the third Key, Ipsissimus Mich ael Aquino is now HarWer. What happened to the old one? Assuming this happened around th e time Dr. Aquino became Ipsissimus, what was HarWer between year X (the separation) and Ipsissimus Aquino's becoming Majestic Man? If Magus Aquino became HarWer in year X (as th e third Key seems to imply), then a) why is Set so antagonistic to HarWer in BoCFbN , and b) why does Dr. Aqui no not report this in his BoCFbN Analysis and Commentary ? 4 Would HarWer, Set's disdained Opposite Self, be Set's repres entative on Earth, the High Priest of Set's Temple? Would Set leave his growing Man (and Set's Temple) under the guidance of such a strange and fitful being? If Anubis' words were true, the truth was not th e kind that jumped on me and insisted that I believe it. I found myself forced to provisionally reject Magus Barrett's discussion of HarWer. I needed to find my own answers to the quest ions concerning HarWer. If my answers then supported Magus Barrett's, well and good. If my answer contradicted the Magus, then we'd have a lively topic of discussion. HarWer is not just an opposite be ing; HarWer is an Opposite Self ( both words are always capitalized). This Identity is confirmed by Set's BoCFbN statement, In April of the common year 1904, I came forth in Africa as my Opposite Self... If HarWer is primarily a disdained, antagonis tic being, then Set woul d not have taken any credit for this previous Aeon. I decided to at tempt discovery of HarWer by examining Set. 5 It has been said that the Neters are aspects of Set; Set is all Neters. This was my first avenue of exploration. Neter is Being a nd Function. What is/are Set's Function(s) and/or motivations?"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"While we can not presume to define the limits of Set's functions and motivations, our writings obviously give the function of Be ing major importance. Set created HarWer so that Set could Be. Being independent of the universe is impossible for the one and only being capable of it. Set can not replace the Cosmic Order without taking its place, without becoming the new order, and losing his independence. More insidiously, each and every time Set make s a change to the universe, each time he influences the Cosmic Order, Set assumes res ponsibility for that change, for the new status, and Set loses some of his Independence. Yet to make absolutely no move counter to the Cosmic Order, no change, is also to be imprisoned by that order. To Be Independent, Set must counter and must change the Cosmic Order. In doing so, Set lessens his Independence. Set can regain total Independence only if some other being negates his loss. Some other Being must also be able to change the Cosmic Order, and must do so. We also feel that Set shares our interest in Interest. The apparently deterministic Cosmic Order can not hold much interest for Set. Even when Set changes the un iverse, he can predict the results; again the univ erse holds no interest. Set therefore would probably desire some othe r being to independently make changes to the Cosmic Order we all share, to keep (make) existence Interesting. (Identification of these two motivations proved to be adequate for my purposes, and I delved no deeper. I'd be interested in anyone el se's further study along these lines.) HarWer is a being like Set, created by Set for the purpose of regaining Set's Independence. HarWer has the ability to alter and/or replace th e Cosmic Order -- to add to, alter, or reverse Set's changes to that universe. A strange and fitful presence with th ese powers is bound to make existence Interesting. This theory of HarWer appealed to me and ra ng true. It explained why Set would create such a strange and fitful being. I then proceeded to investigate the characteristics of this being. I asked several questions: Set created HarWer, but only Set has a semblance not of this Earth. Why does HarWer not? Why is HarW er's semblance of Earth? All gods but Set and HarWer were created by men. The gods Sekhmet, Anubis, Ptah, Shu, and all others, were created by men, in recognition of Neter. Set created HarWer as an Opposite Self , capable of creating gods. \"All other gods ... have been created by men.\" Why has HarWer not created any gods? HarWer brought into being the Aeon of Horus, th e era of Purification. It was a necessary age, condoned by Set, but looked back upon as a curi osity, not important to us today. Why? These questions led me to expand my theory of HarWer. HarWer is a strange and fitful presence, unpredictable, inconsistent, often apparently at odds with himself. There are gods that can be fit into this descriptio n, but they have all been created by men. I then applied common Setian knowledge to this act of creatio n: Man creates god(s)"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"in his own image. Man creates gods who are unpr edictable, inconsistent , strange and fitful, because those are mankind's characteristics. I submit the theory that HarWer is a presence we all know well, the one presence who best fits HarWer's description, qualities, and history: Man. Set create d HarWer by creating man from animal, an evolutionary manipulation, and then giving of his essence to form Man. Man has the power to counter/mold the Cosmic Order, and has used this power , freeing Set to Be. Man is both individual and speci es. Individuals, past Magi a nd Masters, have consciously wielded the Gift; they have effected change according to their Will. Man the race has also wielded the Gift, reflexively and subconsciously. Both uses of Magic are explored in Black Magic in Theory and Practice . 6 Man is strange and fitful. Man has risen and fa llen, several times. Man has acted and refrained from acting. Man has improved his lot, and has slit his own throat. \"... mankind now hastens toward an annihilation which none but the Elect may hope to avoid.\" 7 I submit that HarWer is Man, the species. Great Men have symbolized this Being, have held his Essence, such as Great Hor. I can now accept most of the third Key's statement: Ipsissimus Michael Aquino is Majestic Man, and manifests the Word of Set on Earth. He personifies the Gift of Set in Man, and was cal led HarWer by Magus Barrett. Note: Set's pentagram inside the circle of th e mathematical order is symbolic not only of everything else we have discovered, but of Se t's Gift in Man, the Creative Xepering Will within material bodies. Let us now review the written statements about HarWer, and examine how they fit my analysis. Set discusses HarWer in The Book of Coming Forth by Night . We can also investigate HarWer through Satan, Set/HarWer fused; we will use The Diabolicon and the Ninth Solstice Message as source material for this study. In 1904 Set came forth as his Opposite Self, a nd brought into being th e Aeon of HarWer. Set doesn't say \"HarWer came forth,\" nor \"I sent forth HarWer.\" Set came forth, substantiating the close ties between these two beings. Both wo rds in \"Opposite Self\" are equally important. This Aeon was a Purification of Man. HarWer, Ma n with his racial memory, remembered the value of the teachings of the first Order of Set, and had learned the horrors of the stasis of the death gods. Set, as Set, would not and did not break the stasis – HarWer did. Man had to break the bonds of death whic h he himself had formed. The Book of the Law is extremely emotional, internally inconsistent, rambling, and in general quite confusing to those who have read it. ... This raises the question: Why would a god make such mistakes and present such a profile? 8 In addition to Dr. Aquino's answer, I submit that HarWer, our racial s ubconscious, puts forth a presence very much like our dreams. Before th e development of Set's Elect, this was the best that HarWer could do. Some may question just how far we should pr oject mankind's Jungian racial subconscious, how much power and how much independe nce should be assumed for this global"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"subconscious. But granting the existence of such a joint subconscious, and granting it HarWer's powers, would explain a lot of phenom ena throughout history, as well as the truth, inconsistency, and irrationality di splayed by HarWer during his Aeon. HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and could achieve identity only by becoming what the Cosmic Order was not. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a Void in which true Creation could take form as Set. 9 Set, by manipulating the universe (before creating HarWer), had begun to become part of that universe. He was no longer a being of and unto h imSelf. Set created HarWer, gifted Man, able to reverse Set's changes/manipulations, to assu me Set's unwanted burden, so that Set could regain/attain Identity. \"By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance...\" What imbalance? The universal order by definition is balanced. It rolls on. Permanent changes cause d by Set and/or HarWer are incorporated into the universal balance. Since the universe is balanced, the only imbalance had to be Set. As I discuss above, the one and only be ing independent of the universe isn't independent, at least not for long. Set needed to manipulate the universe to maintain his independence of it, and through this manipulation he was losing hi s independence. Set's need for independent being was at odds with that independent being. His need to manipulate was at odds with his independence. By creating HarWer to take on the 'responsibility' for the universe, Set was able to satisfy his desires and achieve personal balance. It might also be said that th e HarWer-entity is a sort of li nk between Set and the Universe which enables him to act upon it, though he does not directly participate in it. 10 HarWer is an independent intell igence, capable of influencing th e universe directly (as is Set). I can readily envision Set influencing/suggesti ng/requesting that HarWer make a change in the cosmic order. HarWer might produce this change, might not, or might produce a different, altered change. 11 These options (HarWer's independence/fitfulness ) lessen Set's responsibility for the change, maintaining Set's independence from the physical/mechanical universe. \"And so HarWer must exist while Set exists.\" Ha rWer must be present to buffer Set from the responsibility for the cosmic order, or Set shall again lose his Independence. The Aeon of HarWer endured until the Equi nox of the common year 1966, when HarWer and Set were fused as one composite being. And so commenced the time of Set-HarWer -- known as the Age of Satan -- which was to bridge th e expiring Aeon of HarWer and the forthcoming Aeon of Set. 12 I propose that HarWer is Set's gift in Man, an independent intelligence created by Set. I can then accept a fusion as described here, where by Set joins with, merges with (possesses?), man's racial subconscious, Set's gift, HarW er, to better communicat e with the Elect. Set is an ageless intelligence, the ageless intelligence. Certainl y ten years of fusion (temporary 'loss of identity') is a small cost to pay for the development of the Aeon of Set."},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"HarWer is not a man, as objected to early in this anal ysis, but Man. During the decade of the Age of Satan, Set came to man as Satan (Set-Har Wer) so that man could better perceive Set. Since Set had temporarily fused with Man's gifted racial subconscious, perception and communication was facilitate d, as shown by the progress of the Age of Satan. Set's statement, \"I am the ageless intelligence of the Universe,\" indi cates that Man/HarWer can and needs to age, grow, Xeper. We need to develop the full power of the gift of Set. Perhaps we need to free ourselves of our strange and fitful heritage/p ersonality. Or perhaps we need to discover how to use this heritage to maintain a nd/or increase our Independence, and therefore Set's. Set returned to his Void, and hi s Identity, in the year X, havi ng prepared men to communicate more directly with Set's Independent Being. Crowley's communications with HarWer were Ma n talking to Self in unbalanced monologue. Dialogue is again possible now in the Aeon of Set. To do this [to help the Elect avoid the coming annihilation] I must give further of my own Essence to my Elect, and, should they fail, th e Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended. 13 It seems that Set has created two situations under which Set coul d cease to exist -- the loss of HarWer, and the failure of the Elect. Or has he? Would Set do this? Yes, if necessary to achieve goal s that are critically important to Set. Yes, if it would make existence worth existing for. However, it makes more sense to me to main tain only one situation under which Set risks discontinuance, a situation perhap s in which the loss of HarWer and the failure of the Elect is the same loss. This occurs if HarWer and the El ect are each other, or rather are so close to each other, so closely related, that the failu re of one is the failure of the other. This possibility, this theory, is supported by th e above phrase \"further of my own Essence,\" since in the act of creation, Set gave of his Essence to HarWer. Set's additional gifts of year X and since 'merely' strengthen the powers he has already given us. Should the Elect fail, should Man die, HarWer = Man will fade and die; and without HarWer, Set can not Exist as an independent Being. Why must Set give further of hi s own Essence? I suggest Set's purpose here is to enable the Elect, Majestic Men, to create additional Gods, independent unto themSelves, able to avoid the coming annihilation, able to perform HarWer 's Function. Each of us who accepts this task is charged with the creation of He who yet has no Name; we are charged with the Remanifestation of that which is yet to Be. Behold, it is I who call you, becaus e you are the Guardians of the Aeon of Set, zealous in what you do. 14 Dr. Aquino interprets this statement as a saluta tion to the Council of Nine. There is no other reference to the Council anyw here else in the BoCFbN , and the Temple of Set's Council of Nine did not exist at the time that Magus Aquino recorded the text."},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"Instead, I prefer to see this as a call to the Elect, to guard the Aeon and the Essence of Set within us, for if we fail, if we allow HarWer to fail, the Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended. This interpretation seems to me to pe rhaps fit the context of the paragraph better, stressing the importance of the tasks assigned to us. In The Diabolicon , Satan describes the work performed by Lucifer and the many demons, who wrought many changes in the universe, making this a more interes ting place to exist. Note that by the infernal paradox, th is Set/HarWer was binding himself to that universe. This is symbolized by Lucifer's early work for God, against Chaos. The eternal conflict between Heaven and He ll in Man, first spoken of on page A2-4, 15 discusses the effects on Man of HarWer's pr esence -- our involvement with the physical universe and our Gift of Darkness. HarWer's f itfulness is indicative of the tides of battle between our internal forces of union and of identity. What, man, art thou? Why thy presence? 16 Because thy own purpose 17 determines that of the cosmos itself... Consider, were man to perish, what futility would en velop the Universe, for apart from appreciation 18 and use it is a thing of insignificance. And I, who first taught thee identity -- what should I become, estranged from man? For with no purpose the force of mind must fail, and the blind insanity of Godly paralysis would embra ce all things forever. 19 This is the Satanic statement of Man's/HarWer 's importance to Set, and our effects on the universe. Earlier I ask, \"what imbalance was cancelle d by the creation of HarWer?\" Page A2-12 describes the Seraphic War, terminated by the separation of Heaven and Hell (the cosmic order and Set), and on pages A2-15 through -17 th e establishment of a cosmic buffer zone, the Earth and Man. That Seraphic War led practically to the unmaki ng of god's order, and the reign of chaos, as distasteful to Satan as it was to God. Since ther e was no God or Chaos ca pable of affecting the universe, universal destruction must almost have been caused by Set/HarWer himself. Perhaps the internal imbalance caused by the desire for contin ued change/spontaneity in the universe, and by the desire to be free from res ponsibility for such changes, led Set/HarWer to a point where he/they almost destroyed the unive rse. Only by the creation of an independent HarWer who could meddle with and make cha nges to the universe, initially in small but interesting ways, and who had no need to be fr ee from the responsibility for such changes, could Set resolve his own imbalance. The Diabolicon places the buffer zone between God and Lucifer physically on Earth, and places it metaphysically within Man. The following paragraph from The Ninth So lstice Message is a remarkably concise restatement of much of my above analysis: Did I not say that we had chosen to invest man with our own life-essen ce -- that which, being not of the natural order of th ings, we cannot recreate from other matter? In giving man conscious life, we of the Daimonic race empow ered him to order our death. Had Satan's Gift been cast aside -- whether from ignorance or from fear -- Satan hims elf and all who were"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"wrought from him should face decline and dissoluti on. Yet, had I chosen to retain the Flame inviolate in Hell, we Daimons should have become guardians of that very stasis we so greatly abhor. Satan (Set/HarWer) gave of his own essence to create HarWer in Man. HarWer is Set's Opposite Self , not a being of matter (that material wh ich is supplied by the physical universe). Had Man rejected HarWer, had he allowed the Gift to die, Set would face decline and dissolution. 'Decline and dissolution' implies not an immediate destruction, but rather a withering away, a loss of independent being. Ha d Set not created HarWer in Man, or had Man rejected HarWer, Set the single being would ev entually become the universe, the cosmic order. The infernal Gift to Man binds Satan's (Set's ) existence to Man (Har Wer). Yet without the original gift (the creation of HarWer), Set could not have achieved/retained Identity or independent being. The next paragraph of The Ninth Solstice Messa ge expresses a statement I have always felt important -- it has always pulled at my interest: Do you wonder that I so cherish irony? It has become the most reliabl e of all my oracles. Irony is possible only when the deterministic , predictable universe can be countered by a strange and fitful presence, unpredictable in itself. This makes existence Interesting. Irony is a creation of HarWer's, for there co uld be no irony without HarWer's fitfulness. HarWer/Man cherishes irony as a symbol of our power over the universe, our unpredictability, and the unpredic tability we place onto and into the universe through our power, the Gift of Set. Set cherishe s irony as a symbol of his freedom. I'd also like to look at Magistra Wendall's The Book of Knowing the Way and her commentary, partly because at first glance it might seem to contradict much of what I say here. We know Set as the Form of Separate Intelligen ce and Order, and we call Set the Prince of Darkness. We have not been able to define these attributes w ithout HarWer as the Emptiness of Ignorance, Chaos, and the Prince of Light . If Set has Form, HarWer must be Empty, Void. 20 My growth as Shu, with ever-p resent Tefnut, has given me a different perspective on this opposition. Yes, Set is the Form of Separate Intelligence and Order. Likewise, Shu is Hot, Dry, Light, and Active. Tefnut, Shu's Opposite , is Cold, Wet, Dark, and Passive. My experience with Tefnut reveals th at she is not negative, not the lack of Hot, etc.; Tefnut is positive Cold, positive Wet, etc. Likewise, if HarWer is Chaos, then HarWer Is Chaos. The BoKtW includes the statement: \"Form Alone is em ptiness, and Emptiness alone is Form.\" HarWer may have characteristics that many Setians regard as distasteful, but HarWer is Form, not Void."},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"Let's examine the characteristics Magistra Wendall assigned to HarWer: Magistra Wendall claimed that HarWer is Chaos. Chaos is the Opposite of Order. HarWer is strange and fitful. HarWer is unp redictable. HarWer Is Chaos. Chaos is also mentioned in The Diabolicon , as that which is distasteful to both the mechanical order of the universe (god) and the intelligent order of hell. This chaos is a mechanized chaos, dangerous to both god and devil. HarWer is not this mechanized chaos, but rath er an intelligent Chaos, different from the mechanical as Set's self-Order is different fr om the universal, mechanical order. HarWer is strange, fitful, unpredictable, ch aotic, and at times dangerous. Magistra Wendall claimed that HarWer is the Prince of Light. Set is the Prince of Darkness; we are Black Magicians. But neither we nor Se t are damaged by the light. We are encouraged to speak to Set by night because it is easier, but as Anubis has said, Then I understood that Set is not limited to OUR night, but that we are -- we are three- dimensional creatures. But WE AS HIGHER MAN NEED NOT BE. Neither is the Elect limited to communication with Set only during hours of darkness but can rise above the restrictions of the senses and of time and of space and communicate. 21 HarWer is similarly the Prince of Light, but not harmed by the dark. HarWer works with the physical universe, the light, which Set will not. Magistra Wendall claimed HarWer is ignorance. Here I must disa gree. First, ignorance is not the opposite of intelligence; i gnorance is the oppos ite of knowledge and/or education. The opposite of intelligence is stupidity, of thinki ng or doing the wrong (the not intelligent) thing. I am very willing to grant HarWer Stupidity. The BoKtW includes this sentence: \"And when the Ga tes were left open HarWer entered and almost destroyed My Word.\" Given the mind-set that HarWer is Bad to Se t's Good, my initial in terpretation of this statement was that HarWer sought with prem editated deliberation to destroy the Word. Instead, I now see HarWer the Chaotic as that force which just happened to enter through the opened Gates, and which happened to almost destroy the Word. Given HarWer's chaotic randomness and HarWer's nu mbers (all Setians, all people, share this heritage), we can begin with care to apply the laws of quantum mechanics to HarWer and his activity (as we would to a bacterial or viral plague). By these laws, HarWer was inevitably bound to enter through open gates and touch upon Xem. And by HarWer's characteristics, his touch was bound to be chaotic and damaging to the order of Xem. Examination of the many and varied insanities of year XVII supports the connection between HarWer and these events. Only the more stab le of our Priesthood, those personally on guard against HarWer, survived or re covered from this plague. (Fortunately, few of our First and Second degree Setians outside of San Francisco were infected, for A nubis stressed his Word only with the Priesthood and with local in itiates.)"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"The BoKtW also states: \"Let it be known that HarW er is vanquished and sent to the Neter Region.\" HarWer was intentionally excluded from The Xem Working , and HarWer is vanquished. HarWer is unimportant. However curious we may be about HarWer, HarWer himself is unimportant to us, and is not a significant factor in our Xeper. He is our past. HarWer is (was) vanquished, but not unmade. HarW er is (was) restricted, but not devitalized. HarWer must exist while Set exists, and HarWer must have HarWer's power to continue Set's independence. HarWer therefore continues to be a danger. Harwer could not remain vanquished for long. HarWer must be mostly unbridled, otherwise Set would again begin to lose his independence. The danger from HarWer should be obvious -- many events and writings from the years of Magus Barrett show the influen ce that HarWer had (and can ag ain have) on initiates of all levels. I wish to examine one more quote from The Ninth Solstice Message , that which says: \"Man the god shall arise only from the ashes of man the beast -- The blood is the life.\" (Much of) Mankind hastens to an a nnihilation, mentioned in the BoCFbN , and very well described in Magister DeCecco's \"IT.\" Advan ced men (those who share more of HarWer's talents, the more conscious scientists, philos ophers, artists, and magi cians) see, and moan about, and work to resolve this problem. But those who wors hip death (Christians and the like, bureaucrats, and most politicians) fi ght against solutions to the problem. Mankind as we know it will die, and only the El ect, those who assume enough of HarWer's talents and powers into themselves, enough of Set's essence, can find ways to avoid this annihilation. Man the animal, his subconscious power, and his ir rationality, have brought us to the edge of annihilation. By Becoming gods, by following our destiny as Set's cr eation, the Elect can avoid this annihilation, at l east for ourselves, and perhap s even for all of mankind. How do we do this? Should we emulate HarWer? Or should we emulate Set? Do we Become HarWer, consciously leading ma nkind through Xeper? Or do we strive for our independence, fiercely and relentlessly? I find one clue in The Xem Working , where HarWer seems to have been intentionally excluded from Anubis' vision. Similar clues ab ound in The Book of Coming Forth by Night 's treatment of HarWer, as a historical curios ity, looked down upon by Set. I also recall the statements concerning HarWer's being vanquished in The Book of Knowing the Way . HarWer is a necessity, to Set alone. The Setia n path of Xeper is towards assumption of HarWer's powers and independence, and away from HarWer's personality. The first Key of The Book of Opening the Way includes the statement, \"The only truth is that of BEING but to evolve that Being, one must know their own Self. One cannot BE otherwise"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"ordered in and of their Self.\" This is an obvi ous admonishment to emulate Set rather than HarWer. The second Key quotes, \"The fate of my Gifted race rests in balance...\" from The Book of Coming Forth by Night . The emphasis here is that each in itiate must achieve and maintain Balance, a quality which is totally lack ing in fitful, inconsistent HarWer. Priest Cole stressed in his analysis of the first Key \"that Xem is individual .\" Were we to remain part of HarWer, mere manifestations of HarWer's gift however powerful, we would not achieve this necessary Individuality. Yes, we must build on our origin within HarWer; we must grow beyond and out of this origin. We must Be our Selves. Priest Cole went on to say: Being is necessary before Xem can be recogn ized, but Being can only be evolved by those who know their Selves. The \"great dilemma\" of Set -- recognizing his own Being and ordering it without recourse to a stagnant, dead order -- co mes now upon each Initiate of the path of Xem. We must have reference to K now our own locations on the path at any given time, and this Knowledge must evolve even as we ourselves evolve. We must \"take the step that separates but does not divide\", and this is the Evolution of the Self in concert (but not committee) with the Evolution of other of the An cient Ones represented within the Temple of Set. Magister Lewis also dealt with this topic during his analyses of the Keys of Xem. He quoted the challenge of Leviathan: ...Leviathan shall yield to none other than the final mast er of the Universe. ...if thou would presume to realize what neither Heaven nor Hell may effect... Set can not meet this challenge; Satan can not meet this challenge; HarWer can not meet this challenge. We must Become other than any of our guiding spirits. We must become Individuals as well as Gods. One final question: We began this analysis by asking what Set's motives were (or could have been) for creating HarWer, and for giving his Gift to mankind. We can now ask the question, \"Why has HarWer given this message?\" HarWer the fitful needs no motive, which is al most the same as saying that an adequate motive is to see what would happen. But in the fourth paragraph of Blasting Forth by Day or Night , HarWer describes himself as \"a merry being.\" I suggest that HarWer's motivat ion is to bring forth other gods who can make existence more interesting and enjoyable . HarWer plays solitaire w ith zest, but so many other games become practical when you have a pa rtner, an opponent, or several of each. Blasting Forth by Day or Night -- Analysis As discussed above, I believe that HarWer was created by Set, not as some unknowable chaotic force which buffers Set fr om the physical universe, but ra ther Set created HarWer as a shared manifestation of Set's Gift in mankind."},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"I believe that this message is from that sh ared consciousness, which spoke at length through Magus Aleister Crowley in 1904 C.E., and which spoke this message through me in the year XIX. Each Setian is encouraged to decide indivi dually whether this message or any part of it is truth. This message must st and or fall on its own merits. Blasting Forth by Day or Night (title) This title is an obvious variant on Set's Book of Coming Forth by Night , as Set's title was a variant on the Egyptian B ook of Coming Forth by Day . 22 Set is Majesty and Order, who comes forth with calm pride. Explosive HarWer blasts forth, as shown throughout the Aeon of HarWer, and by this title. But speak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier. And those who call me the Prince of Darkness do me no dishonor. 23 This is the only reference to 'night' in the BoCFbN . The night is not all th at important to Set, except for its conduciveness to magic and independence. It's easier for men to contact, communicate with, and work with Set during the night. It's easier, but not necessary. As many in itiates have discovered on their own, Then I understood that Set is not limited to OUR night, but that we are -- we are three- dimensional creatures. But WE AS HIGHER MAN NEED NOT BE. Neither is the Elect limited to communication with Set only during hours of darkness but can rise above the restrictions of the senses and of time and of space and communicate. 24 This title is both a boast and a challenge. It's HarWer's boast th at he operates equally well by day or by night, and a challenge to Set's elect to do the same. What irony, that a Priest of Set should bring word from th e inconsistent and irrational Opposite Self. But then, who better but he who would Become opposition in balance? The Book of the Law , brought forth by Aleister Crowley in 1904 C.E., is the last message from HarWer recognized by the Temple of Set. With many active Thelemites scattered around, apparently still living in the past Aeon of Horus, we might expect one of them to bring forth word from Horus/HarWer. But instead this word comes through a Priest of Se t, to whom Thelema is but a tool to be used for Xeper, and to whom HarWer was but a st range and fitful creat ion of the Prince of Darkness. The use of the term 'irony' harks back to The Ninth Solstice Message , quoted and discussed in the above study. HarWer identifies himself as the author of this message by his use of the term 'Opposite Self', the term used by Set in the BoCFbN ."},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"His use of 'inconsistent and irrational', terms that were not used in the BoCFbN , serve both as a self-description and to validate or echo the point of view held by many Setians (myself included). This brings up the possibility of 'tamperi ng', of Priest Menschel's unintentionally, subconsciously, placing these deprecative words into the message. But because these words fit so well in context, and because they agr ee with the above analysis (taken with this possibility in mind), I f eel confident that such tampering did not happen. The second sentence then validates the messe nger. Shu and Tefnut are the neters of Opposition. By working closely with these neters for a number of years, I have developed an understanding of and empathy for opposites and opposition , of extremes and continuums, and of balances between extremes and opposites. I expect it was this study of opposites and balan ce, and my work to in corporate these aspects of Shuti (the twin lion gods) into my own bei ng, that increased my receptivity to HarWer and this message. Disparaged am I, in Set's Book of Coming Forth by Night , and therefore throughout Set's Temple. Irrational, inconsistent , confusing and unpredictable, I am one of the two gods not created by men. Only Set could create Ha rWer, necessary to Set's existence. The BoCFbN uses only words that seem to express disdain for HarWer, inconsistent, strange, and fitful. These words have produced a mind set where HarWer is looked down upon. Throughout the Temple's writings therefore, with but few exceptions, HarWer is treated as an adversary, often as an enemy. Examples include Priestess Thomas' Set-Harwer and Magistra Wendall's Book of Knowing the Way . But HarWer is not just an opposite, not just a creation. HarWer is Set' s Opposite Self, the only god created by Set and not by men. \"Only Set could create HarWer...\" Perhaps mankind, in cluding the Elect, is unable to create a being as complex and powerful as HarWer. Pe rhaps HarWer was created before there was anyone besides Set to do the creating (ie: be fore mankind was given the Gift of Set). I prefer to place the emphasis on the final quali fying clause, \"necessary to Set's existence.\" Only Set can create a being necessary to Set's existence. Regardless of our ability to create a being like HarWer, we do not have the ability to create a being whose loss would bring about Set's end. And I relish that necessity. Courting my own destruction, I find my importance reaffirmed. Though I be Set's creation, I am also Set's peer, and master. I describe Set above as cool, calm, and collected , aloof and reserved, majestic. HarWer is the opposite, boisterous and expressive. And as Set is ordered in and of his Self; HarWer is neurotic. HarWer demonstrates and reaffirms his importa nce, the importance of his existence, by risking the loss of that existence (like a human who leaves a note before attempting suicide,"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"whose importance is measured by the effort pe ople go through to foil th e suicide). Is it any wonder that Set considers Ha rWer strange and fitful? HarWer is Set's creation. HarWer is Set's peer, Set's Opposite Self . HarWer is Set's master, in that HarWer has the power to cause Set's destruction (by HarWer's suicide). I am Set's Opposite self, a merry being, st range and fitful, Set's tool and master. This appears to be a repeat of the previous statements, but note the additions. HarWer is a 'merry being', who enjoys existence. We ther efore have a clue to HarWer's motivations. HarWer desires not only Importance (as di scussed above), but also Enjoyment. Perhaps more important, HarWer is Set's tool and master. Here HarW er recognizes that his creation was purposeful, and that HarWer's existence and action serves Set. Further, I suggest that HarWer directly serv es Set, by doing that which Set will not do. At least one such function, according to my above analysis, is the modification of the universe. By the conjunction of these phrases, 'merry being' and 'tool and master', HarWer indicates that he enjoys making changes to the universe, a task whose responsibility is distasteful to Set. Bound by no laws, I walked the Earth when Sat an would not, from the fall of the ancient Temple to the birth of the new. And though Alei ster's Equinox has succumbed, still I walk the Earth, and shall so long as Man's Earth exists. This statement follows the previous senten ce in the same paragr aph. \"Bound by no laws\" follows \"a merry being, strange and fitful, Set' s tool and master.\" HarWer enjoys being so unbound. Perhaps being unbound is seen by HarWer as another qualification of 'master', even while being the reason for HarWer's being a to ol. Why unbound? Because of his being strange and fitful. Set 'walked the Earth', paid attention to indi vidual initiates, during the development of the ancient Temple of Set. He does so again now . Set did not pay us much attention between these times, while mankind embraced the gods of death and stasis. \"And I think not of those who think not of me.\" 25 Satan, Set and HarWer fused, walked the Ea rth during the Age of Satan. Although Satan's presence was felt on Earth before the Age of Satan, as described in The Diabolicon , Satan himself mostly retired from Eart h after giving man his Satanic Gi ft (ie: after Set and HarWer first separated), until Magus Anton LaVe y founded the Church of Satan. HarWer did not. HarWer remained active on Eart h all the time from the initial Gift, through the fall of the old Temple, thr ough the Aeon of Horus, and he is still active on Earth today. Why was and is HarWer active on Earth? One might suppose from HarWer's characteristics that existence is enjoyable here , on a beautiful blue planet, fill ed with life, where HarWer can be with other beings who shar e Set's essence (the Elect). All of that is true, but my analysis goes further and proposes that HarWer is Man (his collective Gift), and is theref ore bound to the Earth as long as our physical bodies walk this planet. He shall remain here as long as any man who shares the Gift walks here."},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"HarWer opens this passage with the phrase \" bound by no laws.\" By implication HarWer is stating that Satan and Set are bound, by laws of their Being. Set and Satan have stated what they Will not do -- HarWer has no such limits, and is therefore unbound. Does 'bound by no laws' contradict my above statement that HarWer is bound to Earth? HarWer will be on Earth as long as any ma n who shares the Gift is here. But through Remanifestation, through use of the Gift, and hopefully soon through space travel, HarWer is free to visit other locales as well (physical and otherwise). Were Set to displace the Cosmic Inertia, he should be forced to become a new measure of consistency. He should cease to be One, becomi ng All. Inconsistent and fitful, I face not this danger. Join me as we nullify the Cosmic In ertia; be free of this universe's laws. The first two sentences restate Set's Self-imposed limits, as first stated in the BoCFbN . The third sentence puts forth HarWer's claim to be free of this curse. By definition the Cosmic Inertia can not be inconsistent and fitful. As long as HarWer is so, HarWer's independence is assured. The last sentence is directed at the Elect, servi ng as an invitation to Willfully participate in HarWer's task, an invitation to declare our own freedom from the Cosmic Order. If HarWer had stated, \"Join me as I ...,\" this might then be an offer welcoming the Elect to participate in HarWer 's task. But the sentence is, \"Join me as we ....\" I read this as an indication that HarW er's task is our task, our destiny, to which HarWer bids us welcome. This 'we' also indicates that we are already helping to nullify the Cosmic Inertia, as part of that joint power called HarWer. This invitation is to join individuall y, as gods in our own right, wielding our own individual powers. Note: In almost any writing such as Blasting Forth... , it's questionable how much comes from external forces (HarWer in this case), and how much comes from the transcriber. Even I can not be sure, especially at this late date, how much of an influence Priest Menschel subconsciously wielded in the construction of this message. In addition to my note above concerning the de scription \"inconsistent and irrational,\" I find that the 'should's in this paragraph are not my writing style. Taken literally, they would mean, \"Set ought to be forced to .... Set ought to ceas e to ....\" Priest Menschel would have written, \"Set would be forced to .... Set would cease to ....\" I see no significance in these 's hould's -- the \"ought to\" interpretation doe s not apply. But I do feel that the use of 'should' is evidence that this message is not just a creation of my own subconscious. I proclaim no Temple, Aeon, nor Word. Any such from me would soon be superseded, obsolete, and ignored, even if golden or the key to life itself. The last time HarWer spoke, Magus Aleist er Crowley proclaimed the Word of Thelema , the Formula Do what thou wilt , and the Aeon of Horus. Aleister Crowley proceeded to found the A.A. and run the O.T.O. This aeon lasted 61 years, the shortest on record to that time."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"HarWer does not now name a Magus, nor pus h for any new organization or philosophy. HarWer gives reasons for not doing so, and not having any new Word is not one of them. I interpret this as implying that there will be additional Words in our future. 26 Aeonic Words are rarely superseded. Indulgence and Thelema are still respected within the Aeon of Set, even though our magical univers e is much larger and more evolved. Magus Lewis has even shown us the value of Wo rds from aeons we now find distasteful. 27 However, Words Uttered within an aeon can be superseded. Xem is an example of a Word whose message is no longer actively supported by its Magus. This Word has been superseded by Remanifestation, obsoleted by the newe r philosophy and by the progress of Xeper. 28 Many Setians ignore Xem, and most that explor e Xem do so within th eir study of Xeper and Remanifestation. HarWer states that any Word he might introduce at this time 29 would be similarly superseded, or simply ignored, making such a Word not wo rth Uttering. There would be no benefit to the Word. HarWer offers no such Word. But why make th is statement in the first place? Why didn't HarWer leave this paragraph out? I feel HarWer hints at his reason in his closing phrase. HarWer claims that even if he brought forth a ne w Word which was the key to life itself, that Word would be ignored by the Elect of Set. I read this as a statement that the Elect needs to be more open-minded, more careful in its rejec tion of unpopular ideas. Th e behavior described here is what we'd expect of followers of HarWer, not followers of Set. Perhaps our behavior stems from our origin in HarWer. Many of the problems seen within the Temple's history can be traced to our strange and fitful herita ge. We wish to outgrow this heritage; I feel we are making progres s, but still have a ways to go. Open your eyes, Elect of Set; see Lu cifer's light by day as by night. \"Open your eyes\" is a clear statement that there is much that we don't yet see. This is no news to those of us who see no end to our Xeper. It is confirmation that Xeper must continue. \"Elect of Set\" indicates that HarWer is indeed talking to all of us, all true Setians. HarWer does not wish us to become some thing different (not Elect of Ha rWer or any such) -- he wants the Elect of Set to continue their Xeper. \"...by day as by night\" repeats the theme first set forth in the title. Set is not limited to the night. HarWer is not limited to the night. Neither should we be. \"...see Lucifer's light\" -- We are not urged to see the Black Flame or the Gift of Set, nor any symbol of HarWer's, but rather 'Lucifer's light,' that gift first given by Satan, Set/HarWer as a composite being. By my earlier discussion, this means we are being urged to see HarWer himself, the gift which is HarWer in each of us. Once we see HarWer within us, we will Know that we have HarWer's powers, that we are Set's Opposite Self , with powers equal to any task we choose."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"More, unlike that HarWer which is the gift shared by all of mankind, we are Individuals. We are Selves with the powers of Set and HarWer. You, Elect of Set, face the c hallenge of Michael. Shall you attempt glory beyond measure, risking supreme and irrevocable disaster, or sh all you accept the mindless order of Cosmic Inertia? The challenge of Michael is found in this passage of The Diabolicon : Then Michael turned to me and said, Lucifer, thou hast elected a direction whose end none can foresee, for it is estrange d from the design of God. ... Would we dare presume to this? Such a future might well be glorious beyond a ll measure, but, should we prove unequal to the task, chaos would again consum e all, and existence itself would vanish. Such would be supreme and irrevocable disaster, and I marvel, ArchAngel, that thy very arrogance in this matter does not confound thee, for it is no mean proposition that t hou would realize. HarWer passes this challenge to us. We the Elect of Set, must choose between action and inaction. Like Satan before us, we will risk \"supreme and irrevo cable disaster\" should we fail. But to pass up this challenge means we \"accept the mindless order of Cosmic Inertia.\" Yes, this challenge is da unting. This is Challenge. Child of the Universe, bound by its physics; child of Set, freed by his gi ft; child of imbalance. Will you now accept Satan's limits as your own? The two preceding paragraphs use the term 'Elect of Set', a term we in the Temple generally use to refer to us as a group. We need to open our eyes. We face Michael's challenge. This paragraph uses the term 'child', singular. Each and every one of us is described here, individual and alone in this decision. I face th is decision. You face this decision, and you must decide by and for yourself. Each of us is a child of the universe, em bodied with matter, bound by physics, chemistry, biology, and the other physical sciences. Each of us is a child of Set, sharing the Gift of Set, able to Be more than our physical bodies allow, able to Do more than our physical bodies permit. Each of us is a child of imbalance, fighting the limits of our bodies while enjoying the support and nature of those bodies. And man is the child of imbalance, who shall re solve the issue between Heaven and Hell, and who, unmatched by racial antithesis , shall transcend the rule of the order of God and establish the eternal freedom of the Satanic Will. 30 Only one statement in The Diabolicon refers to Satan's limits, that which Satan can not, will not do: Leviathan is the absolute, man, and if thou would presume to rea lize what neither Heaven nor Hell may effect, know that when thou behol d the presence of Levi athan, thy end hath been attained."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"As discussed earlier, these are limits past wh ich Set and/or Satan Will not go, as opposed to those limits past which a being could not go. Ag ain, HarWer urges us to join him in nullifying the cosmic inertia, that task which Set will not do. Set's opposite Self, god of creation, of independen t intelligence; I Am what Set Is Not, and what Set can never Be. This paragraph repeats HarWer's claim of powe r. Stressing 'self' over 'opposite', HarWer claims to be a god of creation, like Set, and a god of independence and intelligence, like Set. This paragraph also defines explicitly the differences and similarities between Set and HarWer. \"I Am\", with capital 'A', stresses that HarWer exists independently, and is not just a physical creation of buffer. The full clause, \"I Am what Set Is Not,\" states that HarWer is all aspects of Being which are foreign to Set, those aspects which Set can not Be without becoming other than Set. Set spoke in my Book of the Law ; so too I speak through the Temple's works. Seek and find the inconsistency and irrationality. Seek fu rther, and find treasure or garbage. Set encoded a key into The Book of the Law , decoded in the BoCFbN , and discussed in Dr. Aquino's analysis and commentary. That is some feat, for Set to force a stat ement into that volume, through the Magus of HarWer, long before the Age of Satan (desi gned to facilitate su ch communication). If Harwer is us (as I suggest) , then it would be fairly easy for HarWer to speak through our writings. Indeed, it would take extraordinary effort and conc entration for us to avoid accidentally having HarWer speak through our writings. Much of what is written with HarWer's interfer ence is strange and fitful , and what value there is must be mined with great effort and care. 31 We each need to carefully review what we read and discard the garbage, while recognizing the jewels hidden within. We must keep our eyes and minds open, and be as careful about what we reject as we are about what we accept. Arise thus in your glory, be hold the genius of your creati on, and be prideful of being. This closing statement is quoted from th e last sentence of the first part of The Word of Set , and also the last sentence of each of the eleventh through eighteenth parts. These words occur nine times within The Word of Set . The repetition of this statem ent reveals its importance. This use of The Word of Set is HarWer's claim that this message is in accord with the Aeon of Set; that Set agrees with the contents of the message. 32 Arise thus in your glory. Recognize the greatn ess within you now, and the greatness you will Remanifest. Behold the genius of your creation, physical manifestation of the god HarWer.

Through them we can describe the parts, relations hips, and wholes in a manner which provides illuminating complementary perspectives to written and oral information. A while ago I decided to describe the Initiatory process in the form of a diagram, and the result is this article, whic h by no means covers all the ground nor purports to be perfect. Rather, it represents my present level of unders tanding of the basic scheme of the Initiatory process, its structure and scope . As such, it is one among many sketchy tools in my Xeper. Although the diagram has been heavily influe nced by Ouspensky's Fourth Way ideas, I haven't -- due to the broadness of the subject – raised but a fe w ideas and dealt with them rather superficially. For those with greater interest in the subject, I recommend the works mentioned at the end of this article, as well as the references cited -- all of which have had ample influence on my diagram. Classification: V2 - B10 - 1 Author: Vesa Iitti II° Date:  January,  XXVIII  Publication: Iku-Turso , III.1 (Kalevala Pylon) HTML Revision: October 23, 1998 CE Subject:  Initiation  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"Section I: \"The total composition of human nature,\" including the natural as well as the nonnatural side. This half of the diagram repres ents the physical and psychic life (including physical birth and death), subjective and objective time, and the universe. The pyramid shape describes the hierarchy of the parts. Men whom Ouspensky called \"men nro 1-3\" (1) are constantly governed by centres d-g. They do not really possess a distinct, independent, and free consciousness. In other word s, they stay on the two lowest levels of consciousness, namely sleep and the waking state. They live in the World of Horrors, Plato's cave – the 'life' of the inhabitants of which almost entirely consists of reacting to outer stimuli, misunderstand ing the shadows on the wall as their true selves. Even their natural centres f unction badly, f.e.: because of trying to shift the tasks of one centre to another. The interests and activities of men nro 1-3 are restricted to such phenomena which one inevitably encounters in life, such as h ealth, security, fame, amusement, etc. According to Ouspensky, people are in normal circumstances under two kinds of influences. Influences (A) are in line with the mentioned ma n nro 1-3 example, i.e.: of mechanical origin, while influences (B) are of conscious origin, though their present manifestation may not be conscious (that is, they come fr om the esoteric schools of all ag es, from the \"inner circle of humanity\"). Influences (B) reach man f.e.: in the forms of literature and philosophy. If a person tunes into influences (B), a str ong and right kind of \"ma gnetic centre\" may be formed (a group of interests which begin to help him as a controlling, guiding, and mirroring focus in his awakening). Gradually he may begi n to evaluate himself a bit more objectively (to be conscious of oneself, one must also be c onscious of something else), and rise from his sleeping state to higher states of awareness. This means also that one better understands the functions of centres d-g (the f unctions of these centres doesn't require consciousness, but as the level of consciousness is elevated, one may be gin to use the higher pa rts of the centres and receive \"higher influences\"). In this phase the student can recognize an important tool for the evolution of his individualistic psychecentric cons ciousness: an Initiatory school which is conscious both as to its origin and manifestation (influence C). Of the importance of such a school for the development of consciousness, Ouspensky wrot e allegorically in his book The Fourth Way : As I said, man is in prison. If he realizes that he is in prison, he may wish to run away. But he may be afraid that if he runs away he may fi nd himself in a worse position than before, and so he may reconcile himself to staying in prison. If he decides to run aw ay, he must understand that two conditions are necessary : he must be one of a number of people who wish to run away, for they have to dig a tunnel, and one man cannot do it alone, and secondly, they must have help from those who ran away before them. So first he must real ize he is in prison; second, he must wish to run away; third, he mu st have friends who also wish to run away; fourth, he must have help from outside; fifth, he must work to dig the tunnel. No amount of faith or prayer can dig the tunnel for him. And touching upon this subject in Black Magic in Theory and Practice :"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"In the Temple the psyche became the acknowledged focus of the Setian's initiatory quest. The logical mind and the fleshly body were not disdai ned, but seen rather as interpretative and communicative devices both between the psyche and its existence in a material universe, and between various psyches (i.e.: between individual initiates). I'm sure that every honest and serious Black Ma gician understands the significance of such an environment for his own Initiation. Now, when an individual is capable of tran sforming the experiences within his material interface (the five senses), and when he comes in to contact with centres b and c, seeking one's True Self and Xeper really become possible. The centres a through g in the diagram are: a. The Psyche with the Xeper potential / the Black Flame o Setamorphic metamind o Thelema o Vampyric Essence o Sexual Magis source (?) b. Higher intellectual centre / objective consciousness / Noesis / the sixth sense c. Higher emotional centre / self consciousne ss / Noesis / the sixth sense / Dianoia d. Intellectual centre, including all mental pr ocesses, such as forming concepts and words, reasoning, comparison, realization of impressions, affirmation, negation, imagination, and so on. e. Instinctive centre (all inner functions of the organism): Digestion, blood circulation, breathing, cell reproduction, etc. o The five senses o Atavism / archetypes o Orgone energy (?) f. Moving centre (all external work of the organism): Walking, writing, speaking, etc. The difference between the instinctive and the moving centre lies simply in the fact that all instinctive functions are innate and require no learning, whereas all moving functions such as walking a nd writing do require learning. g. Emotional centre: Joy, sadness, fear, excitement, etc. In addition to these, one could mark the se xual centre, which Ouspensky didn't do. According to him, studying it becomes useful only when th e functions of the four basic centres (d-g) – which develop before the sexual centre and thus to a large de gree determine it – have been understood in all their manifestations. I have divided the centres in the \"Ouspenskian way\": every centre has its positive and negative part (the binarity of the human being) . These parts have further been divided into three subparts: the mechanical, emotional, and intellectual. As listing all the parts of the centres and th eir right and wrong functi ons would require undue attention at the cost of understa nding the whole, I'll be conten t with slightly touching on the exceptional negative part of the emotional centre. As Ouspensky himself said, and as I have fr om experience presumed, the emotional centre contains no natural \"negative\" part as do the instinctive, moving, and intellectual centres. The"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"negative side of the emotional centre is an ar tificial, childhood creati on, which has since been encouraged and sustained -- as if it were somethi ng natural, inevitable, an d justified as a part of human nature. In the intellect ual, moving, and instinctive centre s the \"negative\" part is not really negative in the proper sense of the wo rd. In them it serves the useful function of rejecting things inimical to life (f.e.: a negative attitude about walking under a car). Ouspensky doesn't link the centres to the brain, but rather says that they permeate the whole body. [In Kathleen Riordan's book The Gurdjieff Work , in the chapter Our three brains , is given an allegorical scheme of the division of centres in the human body. On top, the head level is the normal and higher in tellectual centre, in the middle, about stomach height is the normal and higher emotional centre, and in th e lower inferno story are found the sexual, instinctive, and moving centres. (C f. Plato's pyramid of thought.)] In placing dianoia and noesis in to the diagram there is the diffi culty that no exact one-to-one correspondences are found. While Ou spensky speaks of changing one 's level of Being and of the better quality of the know ledge so gathered, Plato only as serts a certain way of gaining correct knowledge [To really be capable of reasoning (dianoia) or even intuition (noesis), one must combine practical knowledge (episteme), emotional knowledge (pathesis), and logical knowledge (mathesis)]. On the other hand, to formulate correct knowledge in the Platonic fashion, one must have a well-trained consciousness, and so I think my placement of dianoia and noesis are quite reasonable. Pistis (belief) and eikasia (imagination) can be thought of as within the sphere of centres d-g -- according to the description of the already defined \"men nro 1-3.\" In to the sixth sense or paranormal (PSI) phe nomena can be counted among other things ESP (extra sensory perception), PK (psychokinesis), and telepathy. These can be thought of as the prerogatives of an evolved consciousness, or ca pacities residing in the instinctive centre and accessible for all (racial memor y, collective unconscious), or both. I have chosen the first alternative, for my presumption is that acce ss to such phenomena is possible only for an evolved consciousness. The lower part of the diagram (part I) include s \"normal\" physical growth, and along with it the average mental growth to \"maturity.\" With th is the individual either \"gets static and lives day by day,\" or then the latent Xeper potential begins to take a more recognizable form, and thus we come to part II. Section II: The Xeper & Remanifest process / The Great Work / Understanding subjective and objective time and universe / Physical and psychic life / The Will Remanifesting beyond physical death / Immortality. Pole I included the \"the total composition of hum an nature,\" the natural and nonnatural side of a human being, plus the idea of Initiation; pole II focuses on describing the nonnatural side of humanity and Initiation (which is Worked throug h the objective/physical reality of pole I). If a man could understand all th e horror of the lives of ordinary people who are turning round in a circle of insignificant inte rests and insignificant aims, if he could understand what they are losing, he would understand that there can be only one thing that is serious for him to escape from the general law, to be free. What can be serious for a man in prison who is"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"condemned to death? Only one thing: How to save himself, how to escape, nothing else is serious. – G.I. Gurdjieff 1. This first line represents the Thelemic Curre nt, or \"one's proper star course.\" In my opinion, Priest McAtee defined this concept so well in his article An Anubian Initiatory Diagram that I will quote it: The Thelemic Current is what the Initiate cente rs his Work around and balances the universe in reference to. While our path of Initiation may dart back and forth over the Thelemic Current a number of times, it does te nd to move in the general direction of our True Will and most significantly and less, until perhaps we become one with it, i.e.: the Red Magus, and existence be comes synonymous with the Will. 2. This second line graphs a gradually more harmonizing relation between the subjective and objective universe, k nowledge and essence, theory and practice. Remanifestations delving all the deeper within the Self lead -- via the conscious connecting, changing, weighing, and evaluating of the building blocks of existence, into more real building blocks, which gradually begin to form w ithin their own dark Mysteries (the red smoke!) an ever clearer path in one's Quest for the inner Temple. This is the road of Maat. As Maat's name re fers primarily to \"that which is straight,\" and as it was probably the name which was given to an instrument by which the work of handicraftsman of every kind was kept stra ight, so we can with the help of Maat have an ever better balance a nd straight line with respect to our Thelemic Current, our True Will. The goddess, neter Maat, is the personificati on of physical and mora l law, and of order and truth. Truth is that which as the seeker s of the Grail we must live in Maat, to behold her Black Mirror and live consisten tly, so that we would really Xeper and endure the Initiatory crises which we some times face. Priest McAtee spoke in his An Anubian Initiatory Diagram of Initiatory crises occurring both in the objective and subjective world. I'd like to add the idea that an Initiatory crisis can occur \"in the middle,\" the situation which Ouspensky calle d \"Double crystalliza tion,\" and which is a far more serious crisis than one in the subjective or objec tive universe. Double crystallization is a static st ate which gets worse like a p earl which eventually stops in the bottom of a basin. To avoid crises in the subjective and objective universes, one must work on both essence and knowledge. Work on the Essence must not be forgotten, for it is the Will. If one cultivates one's understanding but not one's Will, one eventually ends up in Double crysta llization – a situation in which one understands and possesses knowledge, yet cannot work on his Will. This may stop the Xeper process. For the sake of comparison, Crowley's formula \"Love under Will\" comes to mind. From Magic Without Tears : The Great Work is the uniting of opposites. It may mean the uniting of the soul with God, of the microcosm with the macrocosm, of the female with the male, of the ego with the non-ego or what not."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"By \"Love under Will\" one refers to the fact that the method in every case is love, by which is meant the uniting of opposites as above stated, such as hydrogen and chlorine, sodium and oxygen, and so on. A ny reaction whatever, any phenomenon, is a phenomenon of \"love,\" as you will understa nd when I come to explain to you the meaning of the word \"point-event.\" But l ove has to be \"under Will\" if it's to be properly directed. You must find your Tr ue Will, and make all your actions subservient to the one great purpose. Our \"tools\" in our Quest for the Grail are G. B.M. and L.B.M., by the first of which the Magical Link is formed, the growing Pres ence and Understandi ng of the nonnatural self. 3. This third line describes the same thing, though from a different angle. The idea is that in Initiation we are in princi ple exercising the same thing, yet we become better at it. (i.e.: in understanding our own self, True Will, Black Magic; Xeper.) Section 2 described the \"within\" aspect of Runa, while this section 3 descri bes the \"without.\" As Initiation goes on, \"concentratio n\" to the essence becomes greater and deeper, and at the same time one Understands wider and more complex patterns in external life. 4. This edge of the diagram represents the ev er-widening sphere of Runa. It extends to the past, present and the future, to the Unknown within and without, as has been mentioned in parts 2 and 3. The sphere of Runa touches al so the profane, but they ca nnot Work with it as they cannot do so with the Xeper Form. As Black Magicians we can Work with both the above (f.e.: E.C.I.) and Become aware of th e True Self behind the past, present, and future. 5. Here we find the individual, immortal st ate of Being, the capacity for existence distinct from the inertia of the objective universe. This is a Self-ordered, autonomic, Self-sufficient, Self-sustaining state of Be ing, a state of pure creation: The Red Magus. Footnotes 1. Ed.

Priest Menschel then opened the gates, with both dagger and wand. Each initiate then approached the alter, perf orming an individualized working of Xeper. Priest Menschel reports that during the passing of the chalice, he saw fumes rising from the brew, even while knowing that he himself had poured the White Zinfandel wine into the chalice just minutes earlier. He also saw a transparent fog ro iling around each initiate as they stood before the altar, varying in strength in approximate relation to each Setian's level of initiation. First to approach the altar was XaMaat. Towards the end of her activity before the altar, she touched fingertips with Priest Menschel. Priest Menschel re ports that his hands would not clench during the remainder of the ritual, until Selket called for the raising of Shu. Perhaps the most dramatic among these indi vidualized workings was Adept Renaud's reconfirmation of his dedication to Xeper and hi s ceremonial reinitiation by Priest Menschel.

[Read the eighteenth part of the Word of Set ; close the temple by first extinguishing the Black Flame, then ring the bell nine times.] [Then say:] So it is done! The Elements and the Self In the study of the Self, it is important to ha ve a basic understanding of what one is dealing with. When dealing with the Self, the ancient pr iests explained the person ality in terms of the elements, as a way to explain in symbolic fo rm what each student was to encounter when experiencing a part of one's Self through self -observation. This was done so that the student would awaken to who one actually was, as opposed to what one thought he was. To be awake is the goal of Self development. One of the systems I encountered while on my road towards the Temple of Set was the Golden Dawn (which has hidden in its meaning \"Heylel Ben Shachar\", Lucifer, or Son of the Morning, also the \"Bright Morning Star\"). While studying this system, I practiced rituals to achieve enlightenment, as I then understood it to mean (which is another story in itself). One of these rituals was the \"Openi ng of the Watchtowers,\" in whic h one invokes various entities in relation to the elements Fire, Water, Air and Earth. In that ritual, as one invokes the various Beings, they were to pass through the magician, one at a time in turn, and purify the magician invoking them. The purpose of the ritual is to se t the magician on the road to union with the universe, in a subjective sense. As Setians, we all know this to be counter to re ality; there is no such thing as the Cosmic union. The only real accomplishment of this activity is to upset the Inner Man, and to engulf the magician in an illusionary enlightenment. What saved me from the trap of illusion was to practice a ritual calle d \"Liber Samekh.\" This was the ritual that \"The Beast 666\" was to use in the Attainment of His \"Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel.\" In th at ritual there are seve ral references to the God Set. The practice of this ritual began to ope n my eyes to what was really going on with \"The Great Beast 666,\" in that I saw that he was trying to accomplish something impossible: one cannot use a Setian concept to achieve union with the divine. I saw that to achieve the"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"goal of self development, I would have to elimin ate the several references to heavenly beings, or be sucked up into Cronos. With each Aeon the spheres or Aethyrs evolve in essence, in that what one experienced twenty or thirty years ago is not what one wi ll experience in this Aeon -- the Aeon of Set. Considering this, one must update the way one lo oks at developing rituals. Example: In the present Aeon the elements should be presented in a way that *enhances * the ego, not destroys it or befuddles it. Each of the Elements represents a part of the self as follows: Fire: positive form – enthusiasm, eagerness, re solution, courage, productivity and creativity. negative form – gluttony, irr itability, uncontrolled anger. Air: positive form – diligence, optimism, joy, independence, kindness, adroitness, cheerfulness. negative form – lack of endurance, pessimism. Water: positive form – respectability, comp assion, seriousness, comprehension, calmness. negative form – depression, indifference, laziness, apathy. Earth: positive form – endurance, firmness, obj ectivity, infallibility – A solid foundation in what one knows as opposed to what one has faith in. negative form – lack of endurance, insipidity, no control over compulsive actions. Concerning the altar and tools On the altar should be the following: The Sceptre of Tcham, the Sword, the symbol of Fire (I use a small candle in red glass), the symbol of Water (this is a chalice), the symbol of Air (I use a flower, usually a rose), the symbol of Earth (I use an unleavened wafer), a bell, a source for the Black Flame, an incense burner (a censer on a chain is best). Any othe r item on the altar to personally enhance the ritual is up to the individual. The reason for this ritual The reason for this ritual is twofold: to seek assistance from entities of higher intelligence, and to declare one's Self in a nonnatural sense. In other words, Black and White concepts in the same Working. The reason for the use of the Four Sons of Har-We r is since He is a creation of Set, then that proceeding from him is also a tool to be used in the hands of the Setian. As long as the Setian realizes that the entities are th ere to help in his personal Xeper, then \"Do as thou wilt is the whole of the Law!\" The Aethyr to be invoked is the thirtieth, TEX. This is the Aethyr of the four Regions. This is the region of firmness and stability. It is also the one most dense and closest to the earth. For the Setian, the Aethyrs are not to be succumbed to. For the one attempting the impossible (uniting with the cosmos), that may be the case. But for the Setian, NO!

Initiation, Magic, and the Temple of Set Few terms have been more subject to the in dignity of relegation to occult jargon than \"initiation.\" It has degenerated into a mere catchword like \"ene rgy\" or \"vibration,\" and few people display any knowledge of what it really means. Initiation is not an event which \"happens\" to someone as in the \"initiation\" ceremonies of college fraternities, or in Masonic or other t ypes of illustrative rituals. It is a means to knowledge, but not of the sort which can be acquired through traini ng or study (though these can enrich it). Most precisel y, Initiation is a process of awakening certain kinds of Classification: B20 - 1 Author: RL. Dale Seago IV° Date: XVI or XVII HTML Revision: Jan 4, 1998 CE Subject:  Initiation   "},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"sensitivities within individuals which enable them to perceive situations, events, and patterns of social interaction with uni que clarity and understanding of their actual significance and potential. The foundation from which Initiation de velops is awareness of Self, and this is meant in a very precise sense. Conventional metaphysical systems tend to stifle true Initiation; if it is somehow achieved, it is in spite of those systems rather than b ecause of them. They advocate a unification (or reunification) of the Self with the Cosmos, Na ture, or \"God.\" Most pr actitioners never quite achieve this, for the personal ego continues to assert itself and refuses to be submerged entirely. This often throws them into profound torm ent, but it is also all that saves them from metaphysical suicide. For there is Something in man which is different from the laws and principles which ensure the mechanical stability and order of the Cosmos. Something which is different in essence from \"God.\" The rec ognition of this Something which makes one different from dogs and cats and co mputers is the first step towa rds Initiation. It is also the first key to an understanding of the legacy a nd true nature of the Prince of Darkness. Initiation, then, can also be described as the continuing definition and strengthening of that Something within oneself which is capable of transcending the natural order of \"God.\" It is constant and ever-increasing e volution, \"focusing,\" intensifica tion and cohesion of the Self. Initiation and Magic are two sides of a single coin. You may be familiar with magic as the art and science of causing change in conformity with will. There is no need to change that; it will su ffice. But most people think of this in simplistic terms: of the spells and other devices employe d as aids to concentrate and focus the will toward some desired end (White Magic in Se tian terminology). Certainl y this kind of magic exists; but by Setian standards it is compar atively crude. And yet most occultists never go beyond this stage. One can play with spells , invoke Wiccan gods and goddesses, and swing from the branches of the Cabalistic Tree of Life to the end of one's days, and it is of no significance. No matter how elaborate the metaphys ical frills of conventional systems may be, at core their principles a nd techniques have not advan ced beyond those of aboriginal shamanism. The reason is that th eir practitioners have become satisfied with being \"magical technicians\" without having gone beyond to become Initiates. This is not to say that the \"psychological props\" of ritual magic are unimportant. To the contrary, they are vital. But most people become so fascinated by the magical trees that they have no idea that an Initiatory forest exis ts. The importance of ceremonial magic is as a training device through which one can learn to focus and apply the will in preparation for Initiation; and ceremonial magic compares to In itiatory magic as kindergarten compares to a college seminar. Initiatory magic is a far more subtle thing than the gr oss application of the psychic power to affect a situation, and it is much more far-reaching in its effects. The Initiate, from his extraordinary perspective, is able to learn and apply magic in a higher sense which is literally incomprehensible to non-Ini tiates. Knowing himself, and able to view persons, events, patterns, and causal linkages with crystal clarity and lack of emotional bias, he is able to see where and how his will can be most effectively applied to accomplish a given result -- whether within himself or with in the context of a social situation. Evolutionary change, rather than mere change for its own sake, is the goal of the Initiatory magician. Hence his actions may ap pear strange and enigmatic to non-Initiates. In the light of their limited perspectives and arbitrary moral codes, his conduct may sometimes seem \"good\" and sometimes \"evil.\" He may assist individua ls or groups, or crea te situations, which"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"promote evolution where appropria te conditions exist. And he ma y act to destroy individuals or groups, or to destabilize situations, if they constitute a hindrance or danger which cannot be ignored or avoided. The Temple of Set is an Initiatory magical so ciety. Yet we have found that not everyone is capable of Initiation; individuals with this cap acity are comparatively rare. Hence the Temple is elitist, serving to identify those who are cap able, and to provide them with a forum wherein they can meet and communicate with others of their kind. And since Initiation, as distinct from magical techniques, is not a thing which can be taught, there are no \"promotions\" within the Temple of Set. Rather, the Temple rec ognizes individuals according to the degree of Initiation they have attained. While the evolut ionary process is esse ntially one of Self- Initiation, it can be enhanced by the guidance of more advanced and ex perienced Initiatory magicians, and this is the function of the Prie sthood of Set in relation to lay members of the Temple. From the Hand of Set Listen to what I speak, for I will not do so again without anger a nd pain. I have listened to the bickering and crying that is done in the name of Set and the name of Truth, and withal have stood by and watched that my Temple be destroyed by such who do not abide by my word. Carefully consider the alternativ e to my self - there is none. Would you risk eternal damnation - on this earth - by my disappearance. My trial is never to be at an end! Think carefully upon what you speak in the future , for it can be devastating. I speak to you all - not one individual, for it takes not one to destroy, but many. A wrong, one wrong, compounds into many, and the anger of one and th e jealousy of another become vicious tools of murder and deceit that slay the good and l eave the unjust alive. I name no names at this time, for such is not necessary. They know who th ey are in their hearts - and others know of them in their Selves. Trust in your Self, and all will be well. Seek guidance from those who would mislead or play their own games, and you will all fail. Never doubt that I speak my Truth, and never doubt that it is so. For when I next speak, it will be through the hand of one who will wield the death, and his hand will destroy all it touches, so that nothing will remain but the ashes of a forgotten memory. I dare no more without you all, and I know not who will follow and meet me at the end of our journey in this world and that beginning in a nother, for there will be few and the road is winding and steep.

Sarris to M.A. Aquino, January 7, XIII I felt the need for a ritual the morning of Ja nuary 6. After a period of time during the ritual [this was about 1 a.m. the morning of 1/6], I found myself drifting. Suddenly my incense burner exploded into action; the smoke billow ed up, sparks flew out, and the coal crackled. The phenomenon startled me immensely, and I s uddenly felt very strongly that I must pay attention. Soon I received the following message, clearly spoken and enunciated: \"'The Magus of the Aeon must s(-) and be comprehended.\" \"C omprehended\" was particularly forceful. The whole utterance was accompanied by a chill, but not a fright. As for the \"s\"-word, I kept trying to remember it, but only guessed at word s like \"save\", \"see\", or \"show\". I simply didn't hear it well. That evening (1/6), at dinner with Linda Reynolds , I related the above event to her. There was a pause, and suddenly she said \"succor.\" The word fit: \"The Magus of the Aeon must succor and be comprehended.\" She had had impressions dur ing the time of my r itual (at 1 a.m.) of \"help\" or \"succor.\" Classification: V5 - B28.3 - 1 Author: Alexandra Sarris II° Date: January 6, XIII Subject:   Magus   Aquino   Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"Later that evening we went ove r to the house of Anubis, and during the discussion I related the events to Magister Barrett. He asked the time of the ritual and impr essions; he related that he had been awakened by a female voice calli ng \"Ron\". He realized that he had heard this voice calling him from the ritual chamber. The time: around 1 AM. Letter , M.A. Aquino to A. Sarris, January 18, XIII The experience you were exposed to is indeed meaningful to me, and I will tell you why: Since the reestablishment of the T_S_, I have had to act in two capacities - that of Magus V° and that of High Priest/chief executive of th e T_S_ (an office requiring decisions which are essentially at the IV° level). I don't suppose it will come as any great surprise if I say that my time, attention, and energy have been devoted overwhelmingly to the second function at the expense of the first. In part this has been necessitated by the sheer scope of the task of recreating the T_S_ in a design strong enough to withstand the treme ndous pressures upon it, yet flexible enough to enhance the Coming In to Being of increasingly more advanced intellects - what I have referred to as the Setamorphosis process. However it has also been necessitated by a subs tantial requirement for dealing with problems and misunderstandings among Initiates. Some of th ese situations I (and/or others) have been able to resolve constructively. Others, such as the Ethel/Holt incident, have defied solution and continued to the eventual regression of one or more Setians. The fact that such regressions may be self-generated does not offs et the tragedy innate in them. In intra-III° communiques I have discussed the underl ying problem as the \"Forbidden Planet - phenomenon\"... Referring once more to Forbidden Planet , wherein the entire Krel race was destroyed by id- phenomena caused by their artifici ally expanded intellects, I su spect that the T_S_ may be starting to encounter just this sort of danger. For all I know, it may have been the real reason for the demise of the first T_S_. If so, it w ould behoove the second T_S_ to address and solve the problem before hist ory repeats itself. Just what does this have to do with your ri tual Working? Earlier I said that I had given priority to my tasks as High Priest, neglecting those pertinent to the V°. While I don' t feel that circumstances have given me much of an option in the matter, I have felt increasingly uncomfortable about it. It has been as though I sensed an impatience or irritation on the part of Set that the V° was not being executed per the intent of the Book of Coming Forth by Night . In particular I have been unable to take th e time to initiate the Working for the Word of Set, whose contents may or may not be germane to the problem identified above. To me your Working indicates two things: first, that the V° function must again receive my attention; second, that comprehens ion of the results of such Work ings as may result is crucial to the continued unfolding of the Aeon of Set. I feel an equally strong convict ion concerning the female voice that Magister Barrett heard calling to him from the ritual chamber; again I can't explain why or bow. It was the Form of Selkhet, appealing to him because of some dang er or threat to Priest Murray of an unusual aspect - the words \"twisted\" and \"torqued\" come to mind. That is all.

It was as if a part of me wanted to en joy this time silently, almost oblivious to these two mighty Magicians at my side. I felt an over flowing closeness and warmth for Set, Anubis, and Sefekht, and wanted this warm feeling to go on forever. Suddenly I felt as if someone or something had \"jer ked\" me out of this re laxed state - as if to say \"Listen!\" Instinctively I fe lt the message to be unpleasant a nd \"heavy\", and although part of me wanted to truly hear, anothe r part of me also wanted not to think, but rather just feel and be happy over the moment. I resisted and felt almost like a baby might feel given warm brandy and milk. I glanced over at my companions and saw they were also contente d and quiet and reflective. Then I felt as if everything were stopped in time and that I coul d no longer hear the night sounds or feel the night breeze. An inner voice sounding powerful but friendly and selfassured spoke with a sort of highpitched unhuman voice: \"Remember these word s.

I began shaking as powerful electricli ke shocks pulsed through me, and I knew that this time I would not turn off what was happening very easily.

She has bid us \"farewell.\" Even so, our souls wi ll remain entwined forever. \"And this is your kingdom, \" the young girl said. \"This is my kingdom,\" said the Prince of Darkness.

During the song I focused my concentration on picturing myself sitting before the altar as I was, and then I saw myself changing into Charon. Next came the song EVI50 . During this song I pictured Ch aron standing where I had been. Then I (Charon) raised my staff in my hand, opened the ground, and fell down to Hell. As I was falling, I took a moment to see the blackness of my closed eyes. I saw a purple spiral that went down in my mind. An occasional yellow line would come through the picture of the purple spiral, reminding me of a line that goes through a T.V. screen. When I got to Hell after falling all the way dow n (I can not remember how I landed), I ended up in some sort of swamp. My vision was blurr y, so I could not make out the exact details of the swamp. After leaving the swamp (I don't know how), I found myself looking through the Gates of Hell (Gates of Hell song), at a gi ant burning city. I sensed it more than I actually could see it. In fact, during this whole visua lization process, I found it very hard to visualize most of the places I saw. This may be because the Daemon Ch aron is faceless and may not be able to see. He may in fact depend greater on his other senses and have them more acute. Is this helpful or harmful? From the gates, I don't know how but I got to the cliff that I had made in my base outline, and I looked down at the black water crashing on the rocks. I looked out into the black sea, to see the island made from black rocks. In the middle of the island was a tall black tower that had no doors or windows. Since I could see no way to get to the island, I changed into a dragon and flew to it. After circling the tower a few times, I landed and chan ged back. Then I walked to the tower and placed my hand on the wall. I sensed that it wa s cold and smooth. I felt to get in I was to touch my Pentagram to the wall.

Aspirants to the Priesthood The Initiate who feels an inte rest in aspiring to the Priest hood of Set has many a thing to consider. He is faced with a largely unknown qua lity and quantity of Bein g, but is not without help in the endeavor. The Ruby Tablet of Set has an entry by Magist er Robert Menschel, Setian Initiation and Recognition -- The II° and III° . I recommend careful reading of it by the Adept, whether interested in the Third Degree or not. (1) Priesthood has its own special demands and rewards. It is the first of the Degrees in which Set himself intervenes on a personal level between the Initiate and himself. It is a Degree in which the good old days of access to a full range of Magical experimentation with no organizational responsibilities to detract from one's time ar e gone. Instead, there are obligations to be fulfilled and duties expected in order to keep the Temple and the Aeon in motion. No Degree is of the armchair variety and the requiremen ts are greater as the Degrees increase. No member of the Priesthood to my knowledge woul d ever prefer to exchange its demands for a less requiring level of being. However, no one can foretell the future and there could be circumstances which arise and force changes. At such times there is no disgrace in returning to the Second Degree if the Initiate is no l onger able to handle the demands of the Third Degree. Dishonor comes in when the Degree is actually nominal and is held merely for the sake of status. (2) Communication is a powerful t ool in the hands of the Prie sthood. Without it there can be no dissemination of information, no abilities to understand questions or provide direction. One point I emphasize to aspirants to the Prie sthood is that of comm unication requirements. Putting oneself in the shoes of another as an example, how would you as a First or Second Degree feel after having put your soul on paper, mailing it to one of the Third Degree, and Classification: V2 - B40.3 - 1 Author: James Lewis VI° Date:  January,  XXVIII  Publication: Trail of the Serpent HTML Revision: N ov 25, 1997 CE Subject:  Priesthood  Aspirations  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"then hearing silence in reply? It has been my experience that Initiates of the First and Second Degree have something to say when making the decision to contact one of the Priesthood, and it is my further opinion that they deserve to hear something other th an silence in return. [Not to be forgotten is that once one of the III° + takes the time to give considered answers to questions or comments, he or she is none too happy to hear nothing in return.] Communication also works inside the Temple to outside and outside in. The Initiate needs a discerning ear and mind capable of receiving and assessing information for the good and security of the Temple of Set. Communication skills are not impossible to master. They are necessities. Communication is not to be found in one single ave nue only. There are those, like myself, who prefer the written word for comm unicating and see great value therein. Others find the spoken word the only way to fly. The Initiate able to succeed in his endeavor to master written communication is easily able to move skillf ully through oral communication. However, it should be remembered that as a Ho llywood mogul once said, a verbal contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Just so, excl usively verbal Magical transmissions lack the quality of staying put for later reference. Should each Second Degree automatically aspire to the Third Degree? Probably not, but given the vast differences in individualities of memb ers the question is impossible to answer in black and white. Some Initiates will be Adepti for th e rest of their days and this is no discredit to them -- the Adept is exactly what the name says, one highly skil led and knowledgeable in the workings of Black Magic. There are great and sound reasons for having great pride in the Degree. For those Second Degree members of the Order of Leviathan who aspire to the Priesthood of Set, your Grand Master is more than willing to work with you. Bear in mind that the Magistri Templi are not going to go about bearing Black Pentagrams on silver platters and asking Adepti to be so kind as to accept them. Priesthoo d requires a certain amount of initiative, so the Adept will have to make a certain number of moves on his own rather than await wise men bearing gifts of Black Stars of Set. The Adept who does feel himself either at the d oor of the Third Degree or who would like to discuss the matter as an event which could occur down the road, th e Grand Master of Leviathan's Order is available to engage in di alogue. Dialogue is co mmunication. I recall an Adept some few years ago who appeared to exhibit qualities indi cative of Priesthood. We discussed it for some months and later he indi cated feeling himself ready for the task. \"I'll try,\" said. \"No,\" I replied, \"don't try to be a Pr iest. Be one.\" He accepted the challenge and is now a respected and creative Third Degree. Suc cess is not limited as a one-time event only. If one Adept can reach out his hand and succeed, others can as well. There are three individuals who are at the cen ter of a Recognition to the Third Degree. The first is the aspirant who feels himself ready to enter the new Initiatory realm. The second is the Master of the Temple who will assess and Recognize the aspirant. The third is Set, who does the Ordination and takes his Priesthood into deeper domains of darkness. Each is necessary. Additionally, the Temple of Set updated its By-Laws in XXVII and a Recognition to the Third Degree now requires the concurre nce of three of the Magistri Templi -- one Recognizing Fourth Degree + and two concurring Magistri Te mpli. Mind you that this does not mean Recognitions to the Priesthood become Hollywood production numbers, but rather that one Master has assessed the pres ence of Priesthood in the acti ons of an individual holding the Second Degree, and two other Masters have found no viable reason to dispute that statement of the first Master. The Temp le's By-Laws are open on whether the Third Degree candidate"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"requests the examining Magistri or alternativ ely whether the initiating Master requests the other Magisterial assessments him or herself. I have tried both approaches and the results were the same in the end, since the two Candida tes were both confirmed as being Priests of Set.

A good Working and working relationship between Grand Master and aspirant is ideal earth for the growth of Xe per. Members of the Order who wish to aim for the Third Degree at some point should indicate their desires to the Gra nd Master so that he will be kept abreast of developments and can offer advice as necessary, for Priesthood is far more than can be covered within the space of a few paragraphs.

I perceive Aleister Crowle y in the park, and I return to the corner. The girl is gone.

Ceremony of Initiation and Elevation"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":" The accoutrements necessary to the performance ar e: (1) black candle, (2 ) incense and burner, (3) small container filled with earth (or ashes fr om incense burner), (4) chalice filled with sea water (or \"normal saline\"). The announcement of the purpose of this ceremony is made by stating that the participants are gathered to witness the initia tion or elevation of members of the gathering, who should be named. After the reading from the Book of Coming Forth by Night , the celebrant initiates each candidate by the use of the f our cardinal elementals. It makes no difference which sequence is followed, but as each element is taken, a fe w words about the symbolism of the element should be spoken by the celebrant. Taking the black candle, representing fire, th e celebrant passes the flame under the hands [or feet, if desired] of each candidate. The fire symb olizes the responsibilitie s of the degree to be bestowed, and these should be outlined. Taking the small container filled with earth, the celebrant rubs a small por tion of the earth into the palms of the hands [or soles of the feet] of the candidate. The earth is a reminder that although we are above the natura l order, we are bound by it. The celebrant lights incense in the burner, repres enting air, and asks the candidates to breathe deeply and savor the fragance. Incense symbo lizes the presence of Set, who gives us the awareness needed to fulfill the responsibilities and enjpy the privileges of the degree being bestowed. Taking the chalice, representing water, the celebr ant gives it to each candidate to parttake of. Sea water symbolizes the origin of life on Eart h, as well as the vital fl uids of our bodies, and is a physical sustenance to us. Lastly the celebrant places the appropriate degree medallion around each candidate's neck, and explains the symbolism of the color of th e degree attained. The following extracts from the Temple of Set's original paper discussing the degree colors may be read as desired: Silver is the traditional color of the night, as is gold of the day . In recognition of the role of Set as the Prince of Darkness and counterpart to the light of the day, the Temple of Set casts the pentagram in silver. Silver has also signi fied initiatory and exclusive religious systems as opposed to open, mass-orientated ones.

The first article examined I° Initiation within the Temple of Set, and the process whereby the Setian may be Recognized Adept. As such, that ar ticle was published in the Crystal Tablet of Set , available to all Setians. This second article examines II° Initiation wi thin the Temple, and the process whereby the Adept may one day be Recognized Pr iest of Set. As such, this ar ticle properly belongs in the Ruby Tablet , available to all Adepts within the Temple of Set. Other articles, dealing with In itiation and Xeper within the I II°+ and dealing with Recognition to the IV°+, eventually will be found in the other appropriate Tablets. This article has three major sections: 1. The II° Setian, an examination and discussion, 2. Public Relations -- the rights and responsibilities of the Adept, 3. Initiation: Initiation of the Adept as a II° In itiate of the Temple, and Initiation into the Priesthood. First though, let's review the word s \"Initiation\" and \"Recognition,\" as introduced in the earlier Crystal Tablet article. Throughout this series of articles , \"Initiation\" will almost always be capitalized. With such capitalization, the word means, \"the process of undergoing qualitative and significant change, Xeper, resulting in a recognizably higher, mo re advanced, and/or more capable level of being.\" When not capitalized, \"initiation\" would be defined as, \"the process of trial and/or effort through which an initiate may advance, may Xeper, becoming better than they previously were, better but not different.\" Initiation (not capitalized) is an event marking th e significant advance of an initiate within a level of being. Initiation (capital ized) is an event marking the a dvance of an Initiate to a new level of being.

The process of Initiation has a si ngle goal, regardless of one's level of Recognition: that of individual evolution. Within that global goal, each Initiatory degree has its Task. This article examines the Task of the II° Setian. I. The II° Setian What does it mean to be an Adept Black Magician in the Temple of Set? The II° Adept of the Temple of Set has been Recognized as an eff ective magician of the Left Hand Path, and as one who follows a path of Xeper compatible with the Temple. There are three basic principles contained in that statement. Let's examine them independently. 1) The II° Adept is an effective L.H.P. magician. This means that: 1. You know the basic principles of Setian magic 2. You can demonstrate them, in r itual and out, as appropriate 3. Your magic is effective -- it causes change. This does not mean that you know everything ther e is to know about magic -- there is much you do not know. You have just started on your quest for knowledge, and most of this adventure still lies before you. Even our most seni or Adepts, with a decade or more of Adept experience behind them, find this to be true. Th e more we know, the more we're able to see areas into which we can still grow. Knowing the basic principles of magic, you can construct a ritual and perform it effectively when needed. You can perform ritual solo, a nd you can actively and productively participate in group ritual. You can de sign group rituals for othe rs to participate in. During these rituals, you disp lay confidence and an attribute we call \"presence,\" the undeniable mark of a magician at work. You practice not only GBM in ritual, but also LB M, and can effect many changes in the world around you through LBM. Again, there is still much to learn, but the journey is well begun. 2) The II° Adept follows a path of Xeper. The II° Adept continues to grow, continues to learn, continues to initiate. This initiation and Xeper can take place in many different realms, of which the metaphysical, philosophical, organizational, political, military, social, familial, and educational realms are just a few."},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"An Adept's initiation will commonly wande r through and among different realms of knowledge and activity at different times. Form al schooling sometimes occupies the highest priority, or it may be career advancement, or metaphysical study. Often we find that occult studies are placed on the back burner, because othe r forms of Xeper take priority. This is not only acceptable, but often necessary. But even du ring these periods, the Adept maintains that element of \"presence\" which identifies the II° Setian. 3) The II° Setian's path is comp atible with the Temple of Set. The Temple of Set is an organization of ex treme individuals. As such, it is reasonably flexible, and tries to remain compatible with its various initiates. Still, there are areas in which the Temple must conform to its standards, and those who wish to remain Adept Setians must similarly conform to these standards. The Temple of Set is first and foremost a tool designed and implemented by Set and the Priesthood to support this fledgling aeon. We will therefore necessarily e xpel any initiate of any degree who acts in ways that will damage the Temple or that will interfere with the progress of the aeon. The Temple of Set is a social organization of individuals. Unlike most social organizations on Earth, this one fosters the ethical and respons ible freedom of its members, the Temple's Initiates. We all expect and demand the social environment within the Temple to be friendly, supportive, safe, and free. We will expel any initiate of any degree who acts to harm or denigrate any other member. The Temple of Set is an organization of ma gicians pursuing the Left Hand Path. On rare occasions, an Adept will decide against the LHP, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously. When that happens, the magici an has become non-Setian, and must be removed from the Temple of Set. We can and do maintain friendships with such people, but they may not remain within the Temple of Set. Set and his Priesthood expect and demand a certain level of ethics and responsibility from all Initiates of the Temple. Failure to meet these standards in one's behavior can be cause for removal from the Temple. Membership in an orga nization that promotes behavior contrary to these standards can also be cause for removal. As mentioned initially in the Temple's introductor y letter, and as restated in the Crystal Tablet and elsewhere, Black Magic is dangerous. The po wers and experiences available to the Adept Black Magician can be unsettling. While some of us are strong enough and balanced enough to maintain our own mental health, many other Setians do face serious dangers at least once in their explorations of the Left Hand Path. The Temple serves as a mutual support group and also as a reality check, wh ere we can help each other stay sane and healthy. Setians in general are not traine d psychologists or psyc hiatrists. We can't clinically diagnose psychoses (an inability to see or work with real ity), nor determine the extent to which initiates may or may not need professiona l help. We can only say that fr om time to time some initiates act in ways which we feel are unbalanced and unproductive, in ways which do not agree with our ideas of Initiation, and sometimes in ways which appear to us to be misguided, deranged, and/or dangerous (physically, mentally, or socially)."},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"As an Adept, you are expected to participate in this mutual support group, this reality check. Communicate with others. If they seem to be losi ng touch with reality, as loosely as we define reality within the Temple, then it's your responsib ility to help them rega in their balance. If their behavior is counterproductive, then it's your responsibility to help po int this out, just as you'd like someone else to tell you if your activities were counterproductive. Call on the Priesthood if you think you see this type of problem. Why? a) the more people we have working together to help the initiate rega in balance, the more likely we'll succeed. b) The Priesthood is a little more qualified to dete rmine the extent of the problem, and what we should or should not do. They might be unable to help someone with serious problems, but at least they should know when to counsel th at person to seek professional help. Generally we're able to keep each other on trac k, but on rare occasions one of our Initiates will go off the deep end (not respond to our atte mpts to help them, and act in ways that are unacceptable) despite our best efforts. When th is happens, we can only suggest that the person get professional help, and we remove that person from the Temple. It's too late to prevent such mental problems, but we can hope that wi thout the repeated stim ulus of the Temple's materials, such problems will not get much worse. Finally, although we do not requir e any Adept to believe in th e literal exis tence of Set 2 , we do require that you accept that this is the Temple of Set, Set's Temple. Be lief in a religion that is in contradiction to the Temple's principles is cause for expulsion, as is membership in a religious order that holds such beliefs. Holding a title, grade, or office in another organization which denotes religious function or activity (such as Priest) is also incompatible with the Grade of Adept. Whew! That's a fair amount of verbiage disc ussing possible incompatibilities between one's path and the Temple of Set. Such a discus sion is necessary, though you will rarely have use for the information within it. In actuality, very few initiates are ever expelled for any of the above reasons. Having dispensed with that distasteful topic, let's now move onto thos e topics that explore your activity within the Temple of Set, as a II° Adept. Having disposed of the \"do not's\" in a few pages, I find it impossible to li st everything that an Adept is allowed, even encouraged, to do. Such an attempt would easily double the size of the Ruby Tablet , without even coming close to exhausti ng the many possibilities. You and I will have to be satisfied therefore with but a s hort summary of the more common activities. First, we can cover a whole slew of activitie s by reaffirming that you can still do all the magical research and activity that you did as a I° Setian. The Crystal Tablet still contains knowledge worth exploring, and you will benefit from studying the material in that Tablet for years to come. The reading list still has many worthwhile books on it that you haven't read. You can still correspond with other Setians of a ll degrees, and contribute articles to the Scroll of Set and other newsletters. Y ou can still participat e in pylon activities (if you belong to or visit one), you can participate in Conclave, and ritual is still enjoyable and productive. Of course, you'll find that others expect more of you now than they did before. You'll be expected to understand more, to be more disc erning in what you read and experience, to participate fully in group ritual, etc. But then, this was happening even before your II°"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"Recognition. Increased expectations are a result of growth. If others ' expectations of you aren't growing, then very possibly neither are you. Let me pause here to reassure you that there' s no need for you to display continuing Xeper. Recognition as a II° Initiate includes our assess ment and confidence that you will continue to Xeper. As an Adept, you are free to find a cav e and disappear if you wish, as long as we receive your dues checks and have someplace to send your Scroll. We have confidence that you will work and Xeper; you don't need to prove yourself. But, stick your head out of that cave, open your mouth and say someth ing, and that something should demonstrate your Xeper! It's easier if you dispense w ith the cave. Share your act ivities with others through correspondence, through contributions to the Sc roll, through pylon or Orde r activity, and/or at Conclave, and it's just about guaranteed you'll Xe per. You'll find it almost impossible not to. So let's assume that in my winning and persua sive manner I've convinced you to be an active part of the Setian community. You'll find other Adepts and the Priesthood to be just as friendly and supportive as before. They'll help you Xeper, giving moral support and helping your initiatory activities continue, if you give them just half a chance. But watch out for those I° Setians! Yesterda y you wore a white medallion, and your ideas and comments were no better and no worse than theirs. Now you wear the red medallion, and suddenly they think you have the wisdom of Solomon. No, that won't really happen, at least not usua lly. (As I, you didn't trea t II° Adepts that way, did you?) Rather, if you're li ke the rest of us, you'll want to demonstrate your Adept knowledge and abilities. The problem is that I° Setians are so individualistic and diffe rent from each other, with different backgrounds, that they seem to delight in asking ques tions which you may not yet be able to answer (or at least they will ask questions which you may not be comfortable in answering). Do your best. Read some more, a nd work some more, especially if you think you may be interested in the answer yourself (ie: Xeper). But don't be ashamed to say, \"I don't know.\" You can always refer them to the Priesthood. 3 Many of us had little occult knowle dge or skill when we first joined the Temple, and had to devote our I initiatory period to learning the basic subjects and skills necessary to becoming Adept. You may be one of these. If so, reme mber that the I° \"deadline\" is now behind you. You have the rest of your life to Xeper as you wi ll within the Temple of Set. You can now not only explore deeper into the basi c subjects, but you can explore th e more esoteric subjects at will, such as Tarot, Egyptian symbolism, E.C.I., MetaMind, philosophy, comparative religion, Amerindian mythology, mass psyc hology, bio-feedback, meditati ve consciousness, astral travel, hypnotism, astro-physical cosmol ogy, martial arts, et c. Have fun! All I° Setians and II° Adepts are welcome to jo in pylons where available. If you have no local pylon, remember that you are still welcome to join and participate in correspondence pylons like the Gates of Hell."},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"If there is no local py lon, but a number of I° and II° Seti ans, you can still get together, meet, learn, and work together. If such a group seems stable, and effectively becomes a pylon in all but name, but there is no local Priest of Set, th en a \"senior\" Adept can apply to the High Priest for permission to formally establish the pylon. Y ou'll need an active spon sor from within the Priesthood for this, one who will serve as a \"big brother\" to the pylon, so contact a Priest for more information. II° Adepts are also welcome to join Orders within the Temple of Set. The Crystal Tablet describes the various Orders, and the Temple's policies concerning Orders. Remember that 1) it's not necessary that any given Adept will join an Order (many Adepts and Priests do not belong to any Order), and 2) join ing an Order is a commitment to participate in that Order's activities. An Adept who does not belong to an Order can hide in that cave we mentioned before. An Adept who belongs to an Orde r must be active within that Order. I used the term \"senior\" Adept a bove. No, this is not a return to Aleister Crowley's artificial separation of that Grade (Adept us Minor, Major, and Exemptus), but rather a recognition that some Adepts have advanced them selves within their Xeper furthe r, or at least more obviously, than others. The II° Initiate who has just been Recognized, who hasn't yet received the red medallion, is Adept, skilled enough, talented enough, and promis ing enough to be respected as such. If we speak of a \"junior\" Adept, it's not to imply any lo wer level of status or Initiation, but rather to remind us that this one is still enjoying the acc elerated pace of Xeper which comes with that Recognition, and that this one has not yet (or ha s just begun) to work with materials in the Ruby Tablet, and may not yet be comfortably fa miliar with all of th e material within. At the other end of this spectrum is the Adept who over time has demonstrated what it means to be Adept, who has demonstrated a knowledge of and comfortable familiarity with the Temple of Set, the Grade of Adept, and the various activities within. Being a senior Adept is not a qualification nor a requirement of someone who may eventually become Priest, but through their activity within and their support for the Temple of Set, they make the Temple's administration easier and more enjoyable. To them we say, Thank you. II. Public Relations The Priesthood of Set has a sacred duty to Set, and an ethical duty to th e Temple of Set and its members, to correctly and appropriately represent the Temple of Set to the public. Adepts of the Temple of Set are free of this responsibility, free to study and work magic, free to expend their energies on Xepe r. You are also free to indulge in your many opportunities to talk about the Temple of Set, to friends and re latives, to organizations and their meetings, and even to media representatives, if you wish. Adepts are able to talk intel ligently and responsibly about the Temple of Set, and about our philosophies, beliefs, and practices. But we mu st be careful. Through years of experience, we've developed various guidelines which should be followed when discussing the Temple of Set and/or black magic with the public."},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"This article, like the others in this series, examines these guidelines. Before we go any further, recognize that Adept privileges and responsibi lities in this area are an extension of the privileges and responsibilit ies shared by I° Setians, as discussed in the Crystal Tablet article. Now is a good time for you to reread that section of the Crystal Tablet article, the section entitled The Potential I° Setian. Having reread the guidelines which apply to I° Setians (you did, didn't you?), let's discuss the guidelines which apply to II° Adepts. These guide lines include some firm and absolute rules which must be followed. Let's deal with those first. 4 Rule # 1: No Adept II° or Setian I° m ay represent or speak fo r the Temple of Set. When talking about the Temple and our activ ities, you may talk about what you think and believe, what you feel and do, and what your perceptions are about the Temple and our initiates. But you should do so only as an indivi dual, as a skilled and intelligent magician, a Recognized Adept, but still an individual. Only a Priest of Set III°+ may speak for the Temple of Set. Rule # 2: Do not demonstrate ritual technique. Following the discussion in Black Magic , all people at rituals must be participants, and only Setians may participate in Setian ritual. You may participate in group ritual with othe r magicians when appropriate, but you may not invite other magicians, non-Setians, to pa rticipate in a specif ically Setian ritual. 5 And you must not demonstrate a ritual or ritual technique to a non-Setian. Rule # 3: Do not name other Setians, nor indi cate the size of the Temple or its meetings. Obviously, it's OK to talk about Dr. Aquino as High Priest, and about Masters Aquino, Menschel, and Moffatt who have appeared on national television. You may verify their membership and status in the Temple. In a conversation with friends or potential Setians you may disc uss discretely what you know of them (respectfully -- use your own sense of et hics and LBM to avoid spreading or feeding gossip, or saying anything which may allow non-Setians to ridicule or denigrate our representatives). If deal ing with the media however (newspapers, magazines, radio, or T.V.), limit your comments to a simple confirmation of their membership, grade, and/or office. Do not discuss them with the media, since the media does have access to them directly (via the San Francisco P.O.B. -- you may give them this P.O.B.), and since you have no control over what the media will do with any information you might give them concerning these initiates.. Equally obviously, when a Setian has made a public name or reputation without calling attention to that Setian's affiliation, whether in the occult subculture or within more conservative areas of society, you should respect that magician's decisions and privacy. Do not tell others of that affiliation. The question often arises concer ning how many Setians there are, and where or how large our meetings are. For a variety of reasons, we pref er not to divulge membership counts or similar"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"information. If pressed, simply indicate that we are fairly small in terms of membership (as elite and select as we are, it could not be ot herwise). Do not compar e our size to any other organization. Do not even indicate whether th ere are others in your own town or not. If pressed, you can state that we keep that info rmation absolutely confidential to protect the personal safety of our membership. (You can alwa ys direct those who are \"insistent\" to the Temple's Executive Director, c/o the Temple's post office box address.) Do not confirm or deny any person's membersh ip in the Temple, ex cept s discussed above, and except as we'll mention shortly. Any such confirmation or denial, even concerning non- members, could jeopardize members' privacy. Exceptions: No minor is allowed in the Temple of Set, and you may point out this policy in denying the membership of any minor. Per our earlier discussions, the Temple will not tolerate criminals (felons) in our midst. If asked whether any such criminal is a member, you may deny that membership if you know for a fact that the person is not a Setian, or you may point out that criminals (felons) are expelled from the Temple as a matter of policy. Finally, if you are with another member who proclaims hi s Setian membership to a third party, you may confirm that membership then and there, or later in private to that same third party. Be careful however that you are not part of spreading this word to others, unle ss the other Setian has indicated to you that it's OK to do so. Rule # 4: Do not allow the Temple's publishe d material to be photocopied or circulated. There are only two exceptions to this: You may photocopy and give the Temple's current introductory letter (\"General Information a nd Admission Policies\") to anyone seriously interested in knowing about us. You may also photocopy the reading list for use by honest scholars and students of religion, philosophy, and/or the occult ( not those seeking to publish popular descriptions or exposes of Satanism or the Occu lt, under whatever guise). 6 Warning: There have been people who attempt to sell our published ma terials, usually for more than we ourselves charge our membership. There are some who attempt to establish fake occult organizations by offering their \"membership\" our materials. There are others who seek to twist our material in ways that they can use against Setians or th e Temple. Dealing with these people after they obtain copies of our material is diffi cult and expensive. It's much easier to simply not give them the initial access. If you have any questions, do not le t anyone else have or copy your materials. Know that such people have even masqueraded as Setians in an attempt to get these materials. Some of them have even fraudulently obtained I memberships, paying dues to the Temple, to obtain these materials for resale. Refer any and all request s to the Priesthood. (Thi s includes \"I haven't received mine yet,\" or \"I lost mine,\" or \"P riest [or Magister] xxx said it would be OK.\") Naturally, if you are very close friends with a nother Setian, know pers onally that your friend's membership is valid, and that the friend will similarly protect our material, then you may share any material which is approp riate to that Setian's grade. Rule # 5: Hey -- this is the Temple of Set! Enough with the rules already! The rest of this section deals with recomme ndations and guidelines you should consider when talking about the Temple of Set, your affiliatio ns, and your activities. Consider them, and use"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"your best judgment, remember ing what you know about human nature and LBM(not only how you can use it, but also how it can be used against you). Let's firs t discuss the personal visibility of the II° Adept. Each of us has a different level of visibility with which we are comfortable, and any level of visibility that is \"right\" for you is OK by the Temple. It's OK to walk down Main Street during rush hour in your \"formal blacks\", with your red medallion hanging on your chest, and your fa vorite dragon pinned to your shoulder. It's also OK to look just like everyone else, and to be invisible to the world. The more visible you are, the more you stand out in a crowd, and the more you exercise the Command To Look, the higher will be your risk that some extremist will decide that you need to be challenged or attacked, whether verbally or physically. That's a ri sk you are qualified to take as an Adept II°. You are also permitted to walk around in societ y invisibly, with none of your difference being revealed to the people around you. This may be difficult for Dr. Aquino with his distinct facial features, but most other Setians accomplish this at will. (Magister Menschel, with short hair, trimmed beard, and business suit and tie, looks very conservati ve and \"normal\".) You decide what risks you're willing to take , when and where. But remember that you can take these risks only for yourself, not for others. Brash and proud behavior which is perfectly suit able when you are on yo ur own is usually not suitable when you are with a group of Setians. Ther e will usually be others who are less able to physically defend themselves, less interested in making a show, and more interested in moving quietly and securely through society. Y ou do not have the right to endanger them. When you are with other Setians, temper your beha vior and attitude to agree with the most cautious Setians of the group. If you can't do th is, leave the group. We will not attempt to stifle your pride or personality, but we do insist that you do not endanger others. Curiously, problems in this area arise most often during Conclave, where many different individuals with many different modes of expres sion and behavior get together in a relatively \"free\" environment, and travel together to ne arby shops and restaurant s. Remember that any risks you take here are not risks just for your self or the small group you are shopping with, but risks which affect everyone at Conc lave. Remember to act responsibly. Similarly, just like you take your own risks when you walk down Main Street in your formal blacks, you take your own risks when you talk w ith other people about Setianism and/or the Temple of Set. As we discuss above and in the Crystal Tablet article, you do need to be careful, but the risks are usually very acceptabl e. But, if you should be dealing with the media, then the risks you take are not risks ju st for yourself, but are risks for the Temple and your fellow Setians. Recognize the dangers of dealing with the medi a. Remember that they too are masters of LBM, adept at twisting people to doing or saying what they (the media) want. Their livelihood depends upon it, and they have a lot more practice at it than most of us do. (Media requests can always be referred to the Temple's office, who will direct the requests to a Priest of Set when appropriate.)"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"Avoid tabloids (of any media form) like the plag ue. They seek only sensationalism, not truth nor information. There is no control over wh at they will print or broadcast, only the knowledge that it will be irresponsible and bear little resemblance to any factual information you might have given them. In general, TV exposure requires more skill than radio, which requires more skill than newspaper or magazine exposure. You should appear only in those media in which you are comfortable and confident, and in which you can present a commendable image. You can refer any and all requests which you feel ar e beyond your abilitie s to the Priesthood. When dealing with newspaper reporters, review their writings to determine how open and balanced the article is likely to be. Do not give an interview to someone likely to attack or ridicule you or the Temple. Likewise, listen to a radio show before you agree to appear on it (especially a call-in talk show). Watch a TV show before you agree to appear on it. If you appear 7 on a talk show, whether on radio or TV, do so only from the studio, where you are present through the entire show. Do not par ticipate by phone, and do not leave before the show is over. It is important that you be availa ble to answer questions that might arise up to the end of the show, rather th an \"force\" the host to answer questions that would better (and more accurately) be answered by you. Media appearances are actually quite rare. Very fe w of our initiates have ever appeared in the media. It's much more likely that you will be asked to talk to groups and meetings. Again, you should review the group and their mee tings to understand your likely reception before agreeing to speak. Honest skepticism, and even sarcasm, is OK, but avoid Christian organizations or others likely to attack or ri dicule you, or those with an agenda which favors hysteria or witch hunting. It's usually all right to speak to groups to which you yourself belong. At least you will then have a good idea of how receptive or hostile the audi ence will be. Remember that while the group as a whole mi ght be receptive, some individuals may be bothered by your religion, beliefs, philosophi es, and practices. To minimize stress and maximize your sociability in this group (of which you are a member), don't force or stress your Setianism on those it bothers. (Do unto othe rs.... And also, remember how you feel about born-agains, and make sure no one will feel that way about you.) Even speaking to small groups is infrequent. Much more often you'll find yourself discussing Setianism with individuals. This is generall y the best form of communication, the most flexible, the least stressful, the safest, and the most satisfying. Remember the rules above, and the guidelines offered in the Crystal Tablet section on the potential I, and you'll generally do OK. Two more points before we leave this secti on, both of which involve responding to items in newspapers, magazines, or othe r media that can impact us: Many newspapers will carry stor ies which echo claims of \"Satan ism\", because that hysteria sells papers. Adepts are perfectly capable of wr iting letters to the editor pointing out such irresponsible reporting, either as a Setian or si mply as a concerned citizen, and many do so."},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"Similar letters to magazines, radio stations, a nd TV stations are OK t oo. Even if your letters aren't printed in the paper or acknowledged, ma ny newspapers will become more responsible just because they know someone is paying attention to that. Pay attention to whether the article is written locally or simply printed as received from a news \"wire\". If the latter, you can then compla in about the quality of the news service, without directly attack ing your local paper. You can ask th em to help \"shield\" you and the area from such irresponsible reporting. Indeed, some of us have even written letter s thanking newspapers and other media for their balanced and responsible repor ting when the specter of \"Sat anism\" is played down. Media people like praise also. On rare occasions, you may find an article or show that is so bad that it needs an \"official\" response from the Temple of Set. If so, please refer this to the Priesthood. They will generally need a complete copy of the article, or a tape of the show, in order to respond appropriately. III. Initiation Many Adepts' Xeper have been slowed or even warped by their excessive desire to enter the Priesthood. Some of the Priesthood feared that by discussing the III°, and the steps of Initiation which lead to it, we might unintenti onally increase this te ndency and harm our Initiates. They suggested that perhaps this thir d section of the article should be left out. The other side of that coin is, part of the reason so many Adepts have fallen into this particular pit is because they had too little guidance past it. We therefore present this information in the hope that it will help Adep ts Xeper in a more Balanced manner, and to initiate and Initiate themselves properly and sa fely, rather than increase the temptations presented by the black medallion. Along these lines, let's repeat the st atement found in the appendix of Black Magic: \"It is expected that the majority of Setians will hold the II° for Earthly life.\" Let's restate that: Being Adept in the Temple of Set is glorious. The Adept is skilled, knowledgeable, powerful, and free, and becomes mo re so with each act of Xeper. To remain Adept for one's whole life, decade after decade, pursuing one's Xeper, is a magical feat worthy of extreme pride, a feat all too few initiates accomplish. (Our drop-out rate would worry us, were it not for the very high quality of the Initiat es who remain.) So, being Adept for the rest of your life is desirable, and not be ing Recognized to the III° is insignificant compared to the glory that li es ahead of each and every II° Adept. That having been said, we can also say that since that statement in Black Magic was written, we've discovered that the great majority of Adepts who continue th eir Xeper within the Temple of Set do eventually Initiate themselves to the III°, and are so Recognized. We used to think that the Priesthood, being esse ntially an unnatural state of being, would be extremely rare, and that the great majority of II° initiates would remain II° initiates forever."},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"Time and history have shown othe rwise. As unnatural as the state of Being of a Priest of Set is, it seems that Setian Xeper, aided by Set's t ouch, often leads to that oh-so-unnatural state of Being. So, if you desire to be Recogni zed to the Priesthood, there is a very good chance that you can eventually achieve that Recognition. There are some caveats you need to keep in mind, though, if Priesthood is a goal: 1) Priesthood, the III°, is a qualitatively different state of being than is held by the II° Adept. To become III° you must Initiate yourself from the II° to the III°. You can not do this through initiation, but only th rough Initiation. You also can not become Priest by imitation or emulation. Emulating or parroting the actions of Priest(s) won't speed your In itiation nor your Recognition. By all means, pay attention to what our Priests do and say, and adopt those be haviors which are most appropriate to your own Xeper. But do so honestly and for the sake of your Xeper, not to become Priest, for the latter approach will only slow you down. 2) The current Priesthood and even the Magistry can not help you in this process. We simply don't know how. Each Priest of Set is so utte rly unique that whatever works for one quite possibly may harm another. We'll support you al l we can, but you're basically on your own. 3) Generally we've found that the harder you try to reach the Priesthood, the further away it is. The III° appears to be one of those goals that simply can not be approached directly. The best methods of undergoing Initiation seem to be those used by II° Adepts as II° Adepts, without pursuing the III°. The key to this Initia tion is Xeper, Xeper directed by your Higher Self and by Set. Looked at another way, Xeper for the sake of Xeper can bring you to the III°. Xeper for the sake of reaching the III° won't. 4) \"...the great majority of Adepts who con tinue their Xeper within the Temple of Set do eventually Initiate themselves to the III°...\" But the majority of Setians who are Recognized to the II° \"drop out\" of the Temple of Set without nearing the III°. Many II° initiates resign, either directly or indirectly because they were not Recognized to the III°. They weren't Recognized, because they hadn't become III°. One's Initiation must come first -- Recognition can only follow Initiation, and we won't Recognize someone who hasn't begun to truly become III°. If you can accept all of the above, and if you can actively pursue your Xeper as an Adept, without attempting to become Priest, but rather to simply be the best Adept you can be, to be the most Adept you can be, and if you stick with it, then there's a very good chance that you'll be wearing the black medallion some time in the future. 8 "},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"There are patterns we've identified in many of the Setians who b ecome Priests, patterns which we believe can help you prepare for the Initiation that may or may not come. One characteristic of all who are Rec ognized to the III° is communication. Some communicate widely throughout the Temple, and some communicate only to a select few. They all communicate on topics of significant interest to Se tians, discussing philosophical, magical, and practical advances they make in whatever areas they are working. Just as the I° Setian must comm unicate with a III° Priest to be Recognized as Adept, the II° Setian must communicate with a IV° Master of the Temple to be Recognized as Priest. If you are a member of an Order, you should al ready be in regular contact with your Grand Master. That is enough. If you do not belong to an Order, and if you feel you are nearing the III°, then you should establish or maintain regu lar communications with a compatible Master of the Temple. Usually no special action is needed here. While a III° Priest can not Recognize a Setian to the III°, our Priests certainly can see when there's something \"different\" about a II° Initiate, and these Priests will always bring this to the attent ion of the IV°. As long as you're in regular contact with the Priesthood, th ey'll see that you are put in touch with the IV° when appropriate. 9 Your communication need not be written. It can be verbal and/or through personal meetings. But remember that skill in written communicatio n is a very highly desirable talent, and those Adepts and Priests who develop and exercise th is skill help the Temple and its Initiates in many ways. A second characteristic shared by many who become Priest is the breadth of their interest and work. Whether or not they bel ong to any pylon or Order, these Adepts explore many different areas of Setian activity. They then discuss thei r discoveries and advances, their work, with others, sharing knowledge, aski ng and answering questions. It's very likely that this varied activity help s prepare Adepts for the Priesthood, for reasons not yet known. Many Setians of all degrees have fo und that working \"wit hout lust for results\" brings tremendous results. It's as if working towards a goal limits your bene fits to the realm of that goal. Doing the same work without th e goal seems to open our minds to many more benefits. A third characteristic shared by many nascent Priests is a high level of illustrative GBM Work, especially that dealing with the Higher Self, the neteru, and/or Set. This doesn't mean that operative work becomes le ss frequent or less import ant, but rather that illustrative work seems to bring out thos e changes which may lead to the III°. It is critically important here to maintain comm unications with other II° Adepts and with the Priesthood. This illustrative work can be very valuable when valid, and very dangerous when invalid. Often it's only the feedback we get from our brothers and sisters on the LHP which helps us determine the valid ity of any such working."},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"Those first few attributes above are somewhat nebulous. I feel they're important, but we can't as yet give much guidance in these areas. Ther e are some areas in which we can be more specific... The Magistry, and indeed the entire Priest hood of Set, is charged with the support and protection of the Temple of Set, its Initiates , and the Aeon. Because of this, there are some personal characteristics requi red of every Priest, and no II° Adept whose behavior goes counter to these characteristics wi ll be Recognized to the Priesthood. 1) A Priest of Set will show levels of knowle dge, ability, and confidence in areas of activity appropriate to the Priesthood. A II° Initiate who may be nearing the III°, but who is unable to display any confidence in following that initia te's Priestly inspiration, is not ready for Recognition. Likewise, a II initiate who continue s to exhibit great enthusiasm for activities and behaviors appropriate only to junior initia tes is also not ready for III° Recognition. 2) A Priest of Set needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of differe nt types of people (ie: Setians of all types), both individually and in groups . An Initiate who is unable to handle relationships with people or groups in a balanced manner is not yet ready for the responsibilities of Priesthood. 3) It's a sad fact, but the Temple of Set and its junior initiates are not immune to the foibles of human group interaction, gossip, jealousy, paranoia, etc. As long as we allow new initiates to affiliate with the Temple, they will bring th eir foibles with them. The Priesthood must be immune to such foibles; they must be able to detect such traits, and to weed them out of Setian interactions. A II° initiate who indulges in or who falls vict im to such foibles is not yet ready for Recognition to the Priesthood. 4) A Priest of Set needs to be able to deal with the public and/or with individual people outside of the Temple. A Priest of Set must be able to represent not only that individual's Setianism, but must also be able to represent the Temple of Set. An Initiate who shows poor judgment in dealing with non-Setians is not yet ready for III° Recognition. Basically, the two questions which the Magistry must always ask themselves concerning any potential Priest is, do we want this Initiate to represent the Temple of Set to both Setians and non-Setians, and would we trust th is Initiate with the future of the Temple of Set? While the answer to either of those ques tions is \"no\", the Temple of Se t can not afford to call that Initiate \"Priest\". [If you should see what seems to be a Priest (III° +) not meeting these standards, your first step should be to discuss this priv ately (preferably in person, but at least by correspondence) with that Priest. There may be situations or inform ation of which you are not aware. If you are not satisfied with that discussion, then you may disc uss the matter, again privately and discretely, with a member of the Council of Nine. The C ouncillor will determine whether there is a problem, and if so then the Councillor will resolve it.] That having been said, remember that these char acteristics, necessary personal attributes, are not sufficient. They are necessary for the protection 10 of the Temple of Set and its initiates -- they are not sufficient for Recognition."},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"When we proclaim a Priest of Set, the singl e characteristic which we Recognize is the fact that Set himself has seen and touched and chos en the Initiate. The In itiate, through his own Work and Xeper, has brought himself to Set's at tention, and Set sees within the Initiate the Potential of true greatness. Set touches the Init iate and works with the Initiate, increasing the brilliance of the Initiate's Black Flame. It is this touch, this added brilliance, that the Magistry of Set will Recognize as a Priest of Set Come into Being. Set chooses the Initiate. The Te mple Recognizes the effects of that choice. Set chooses the Initiate, but not a ll of Set's chosen must serve as Priests of his Temple. It is regrettable, but because of the small si ze of the Priesthood, there are a number of responsibilities that must be borne by each Prie st. While we try to keep these responsibilities from being oppressive, they can sometimes interfere with what you would like to do. Priesthood is therefore not mandatory for thos e Set has chosen. If/when you are approached concerning Priesthood, if you feel the re sponsibilities would interfere too greatly with your personal Xeper, you may say, \"Not yet.\" One option always open to the Priesthood is a voluntary return to the II°, the Grade of \"freedom\" to pursue your Xeper without Priestly responsibility. This option has been used by several Initiates, and it brings no shame or lower respect to anyone. But to help the organization run smoothly, it's better that an Ini tiate postpone this formal Recognition instead of accepting the formal Recognition and th en shortly returning to the II°. Set chooses the Initiate. This is what makes the Priesthood of Set a true Priesthood, the likes of which have not been seen si nce the days of ancient Egypt. This is what makes the Temple of Set the valid religious organization today (\"All other gods of all other times and nations have been created by men.\") However, each Priest of Set is unique, and th e relationship between each Priest and the Prince of Darkness is unique. I asked several Priests to help me illustrate just a few of the many ways in which the III° Initiate wo rks with, and views, Set. 11 Priestess Pat Hardy: How does an adherent of a reasoning religion -- an initiatory philo sophy -- distinguish a metaphysical experience from a hallucination? There are no false experiences, but it is possi ble to misinterpret an experience due to ignorance or self-deceit. The mystical e xperience reported by members of conventional religions, for example, is used to justify clai ms contrary to reason. It is easy to trace the psychological and political basis of these clai ms, and the fact that advances in science demonstrate their falsity supports our assessment of them. What I experienced began with philosophical reflec tion on the idea of me taphor, the capacity of the psyche to abstract. Tracing the mystery of language and its preservation of man's earliest thoughts in the evoluti on of words, I pondered the id eas of darkness, fire, time, orientation, and identity."},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"I knew already that Satanism as it was comm only understood was a degeneration. I felt that my studies had given me not only sympathy but in sight into the myths of the Dark Lord, and these concepts were the key to that insight. I de cided to write out my t houghts; there were too many ignorant people telling lies on the subject, and somebody had to do something about it. After that, I realized something had changed. I was explaining myself to Something new in my mind, and the Something was making comments. This puzzled me. The Something was far more intelligent than I was -- which made me sit up and take note -- but made no bogus claims. It had a weird sense of humor. From time to time the Something would interrupt our \"discussion\" by suggesting new activiti es or changes to my lifestyle. I acted on some of the suggestions while con tinuing to examine my ideas about all this. I became more solitary, less predictable, less to lerant of bad management, more charismatic, more visionary. I spent months analyzing these suggestions, tryi ng to decide whether this was an aspect of my subconscious, a version of myself in the future, or an Other. This entity was certainly not the God described by Islam, Christianity and Judaism, nor was it an \"earth god\". It reminded me of the daemon of Socrates. To assume that it was the Dark Lord Himself seemed like the height of pr esumption. Perhaps it was my Crowleyan Holy Guardian Angel -- but how would I know? Realiz ing that other people had \"visitations\" was reassuring, but did not dispel the mystery. I began to suspect that this experience was triggered by having brushed against something buried in human prehistory and preserved in the structure of the mind itself. When I discovered that there were other people with this experience and this same suspicion -- when I encountered the Temple of Set -- I decided th at there might be some support for this interpretation. The experience itself continue s to command my respect and attention. Priest Robert Robinson: Set is: First among Indwelling Essences. This definition of Set is, of course, subject to considerable embellis hment and clarification, but at the same time the simplicity of the stat ement and its implications appeal more to me than any other realizations I have had. A dvancement through the Degree system of the Temple of Set is a process of continuous refinement of this simple insight. The Second Degree recognizes this relationshi p and drinks deeply of this \"Blood of Life\". The Third Degree merges with and becomes one with the Darkness of the Potentia l, but largely unknown Self. From this union, the absorpti on of all light and all color, implodes into the Black of the Third Degree from which all light and color is reborn. Priest Brian Zimmer: The Prince of Darkness is the still-existing pr ototype of human consciousness and awareness, particularly as that awareness re cognizes the Self as distinct fr om other sentient beings and its environment. As far as I am concerned, the only credible way to approach the reality of this entity is via the use of the intellect. Set can honestly be adm itted only after the use of rational thought and analysis. Indeed, it is this rigorous process which ultimately brings the initiate to the brink of"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"what Plato termed Noesis. All other avenues ar e \"cheating\" and suspect , suggesting as they do the mystical and emotional -- or worse. It is th is real danger that prompts me to steer Setians towards philosophical inquiry. My particular emphasis on Plato and the Forms when searching for the truth concerning the Set entity is two-fold. First, following Plato's thought is a worthy enou gh exercise in and of itself, helping the mind to think in a disciplined fashion. By following the line of argument to its logical conclusion, the reader is forced to make a conscious deci sion as to the validity of Plato's thought, and whether one wishes to follow him further down th e path he delineates. This sort of thinking, resulting in decision making, is an importa nt step in the process of initiation. Secondly, if the seeker opts to cross the line drawn by Plato and to enter the realm of the Forms, he/she will still be unabl e to abdicate logic and critical thinking. Indeed, he/she will be forced to ultimately wrestle with that idea which is the raison d'etre of the Temple of Set in the world: how and why humanity has been so rendered as to make abstract thought possible, and who or what is behind this most profound and singular of occurrences? More succinctly, who or what is behind our unnatural ability to ev en perceive the Forms in the first place? The process leading to one's noesis of Set differs from initiate to initiate. This is where great caution must be exercised in the evaluation of in dividual experience, and it is the Temple of Set's emphasis on the use of Occam's Razor in conjunction with rati onal and logical thought that grants credibility to its more esoteric postulates. Dr. Michael Aquino: I have never been very fond of the term \"belie f\" where Set is concerned. Terms like \"belief\" [and \"faith\"] imply that one just has [or is e xpected to have] an opinion which has no rational basis behind it. The relevant point of Black Magic is that there is a necessity for the existence and influence of Set, and it is based upon this necessity that we presum e his existence. Having made such a presumption, through a more precise Understanding of our own consciousness, we empathize with this Form or Neter. None of this requires \"faith\" or \"belief\". In this sense indeed we don't require \"faith or belief in Set\" of anyone in the Temple, no matter what degree. On the other hand, I would expect anyone qualifying for the II° to comprehend the above presumption and to personally agree with it. If one cannot or will not, then that person is not [in my opinion] displaying the kind of mental and initiatory rigor of thought that identifies an Adept II°, much less any higher degree. Part of the \"confusion\" in this entire topic of discussion hinges upon the Temple's use of the term \"religion\" to describe itself. As you know , we do this, and call ou rselves a \"church\", in order to define ourselves for profane societ y and the U.S. Constitution. Nevertheless, the terms \"church\" and \"religion\" usually identify low-level, commercial, emotional belief systems devoid of the sort of rigorous concep tualizations and comprehension expected of every II+ Initiate of the Temple of Set. Some people evidently enter the Temple expecting it to be more or less like ot her churches, or like pop-occu lt groups they have known (A.M.O.R.C., O.T.O., what-have- you). Wrong. This is an entir ely different intellectual"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"environment, comparable only to systems such as that of Plato's Academy or the original Egyptian priesthood orders such as portrayed in Her-Bak. We are the Temple of Set in that very an cient and precise sense, as the Priesthood of Set is a priesthood in a very ancient and precise sense, entirely alien to the \"c areer priesthoods\" of profane churches. And within th e Temple, I would speak of our interests not as a \"religion\" but rather as a metaphysical philosop hy (both theoretical and applied). [In a different letter, inspired by di fferent questions, Dr. Aquino said,] What do we know of the essence of Set? We do know that the image of an anteater-like creature is merely a hieroglyphi c convenience -- a handle for us to grasp in conceptualizing this Form or Neter. We know that Set possesses consciousness: Set is the universal principl e of consciousness, as we are particularizations of it. We know that Set is non-natural, as the essence of consciousness places it \"at arm's length\" from apprehended nature. I am reminded of the statement in the Book of Coming Forth by Night that \"all other gods are created by men\". I never Understood this as a di smissal of the reality or significance of other neteru, but rather as an indication that humans possessi ng consciousness can then conceptualize the other neteru in a way that non -self-conscious beings cannot. In this sense, neteru may be \"ideas\", and Set is a sort of \"idea-capacity\" Form. One final topic that should probably be discusse d is the \"timing\" of one's Recognition to the Priesthood. After all, Recognition does not conf er perfection upon the Priest. Recognition is the statement of a Master of the Temple than an Initiate has reached th e III° level of being, having been touched and chosen by Set, that this Initiate drifts to some extent in and out of this level of being, but will (to the best of our enlightened ex pectation) continue to grow within the III° level of bei ng, will spend more and more tim e within the Black Realms, and that this Initiate can responsibly fulfill the duties of a Priest. Again, we all drift in and out of the Black Realm, to greater or lesser extent, as we approach and even well after Recognition to the Priesthood of Set. The timing of a Recognition is therefore rarely \"exact\" -- there is a fairly extended period of time during which an Initiate is \"becoming\" a Priest of Set, and that Initiate's III° Recognition may take place any time during (or even shortly after) this period. When we Recognize a Priest \"too la te\" (significantly after the In itiate has Become Priest and is able to fulfill the duties of the Priesthood), we have penalized the Temple and its initiates, for the Recognized One could not fully participat e as a Priest until that Recognition. When we Recognize a Priest \"too early\", we risk harm ing the Temple and th e Initiate through the initiate's inability to fulfill the duties of Pr iesthood, and through added stress placed on the Initiate's being for which the Initiate is not ready. Obviously, the latter dangers are much worse than the former. When there is any question as to whether the Initiate is \"ready\" for the Prie sthood, we will often choose to \"err\" on the side"},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"of safety. We regret the delays this will someti mes cause, but feel these delays justified for the sake of both Initiate and Temple. Having spent about half of this article on the topic of III° Initiation, let me close by reminding you that III° Initiation is not the goal of Adept magicians, and should not be. Though III° Initiation is a critic al and sensitive time for those who go through it, the most important section of this arti cle is the first section, that dealing with the II° Setian as a II° Initiate of the Temple of Set. Study that sec tion, follow its guidelines, and your Xeper within the Temple of Set will be strong and successful , regardless of the color of your medallion. Xeper and Remanifest Footnotes 1 With thanks to the many members of the Prie sthood who have helped me develop this article over the past several years, and to those whos e reviews and comments helped improve this article significantly. 2 See Dr. Aquino's comments on this topic on page 18. 3 Ah, and guess who will refer people to wh om if/when whom wears a black medallion... 4 \"Absolute\" is a word which ra rely applies in the Temple of Set. For almost all of the \"absolute\" rules we've ever developed, excepti ons have later been discovered. But those exceptions require the analysis and approval of the Priesthood, or even of the High Priest. Treat these rules as absolute rules unless instru cted otherwise by a higher initiate. 5 This rule does not prevent you from conduc ting a personal ritual for someone else, and having that person participate. See the Setian Ritual of Protection in the Ruby Tablet for an example of an acceptable \"non-Setian\" ritual. 6 Both the introductory letter and the reading list may be do wnloaded from Glinda, the Temple of Set's BBS, and printed copies may be requested from the Temple's administrative offices. Donations to cover printing and postage costs for the latter shoul d be included with your request. 7 This applies only to when you're a featured \"guest\" on such a show. You may \"call in\" to any such show at any time, using your own name or an alias, as long as you are responsible in what you say. The same principle applies to posting messages on computer bulletin board systems. 8 How long? Most Adepts who become Priest do so two to six years after their II° Recognition. Some Initiate to the III° faster (w e believe that Magus Stephen Flowers currently holds the record for the fastest III° Recogniti on), while others find themselves approaching the III° perhaps ten years or mo re after their II° Recognition."},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"9 Likewise, as an Adept, if you see II° quali ties in a I° Setian, you may and probably should bring this to the atte ntion of the Priesthood. 10 They are attributes necessary for the fulfillment of the responsibilities of Priesthood, and they are not necessary for all In itiates. Initiates who don't meet all of these qualifications can still Xeper and achieve highly desirable goals; certainly whether one wears a black medallion is not a measure of an Initiate's potential or worth. 11 Their contributions are edited.

Of course, at th e time of the Vision I did not know the whole of its impact; only that it possessed certain parallels with my self- transformations in 'real' life. Certainly, memory of the future cannot exist. Think rather of the Will and its connection with our destinies ... As I became conscious of the unfolding scenario, I was driving a car along an isolated, country highway. An unidentified, male comp anion travelled with me. It was night. Instinctively, I drove off the main highway. We entered onto a roadway that led into the forest. Itself seeming lit through phosphorescen ce. Dark, eerie. Large, green, seemingly translucent spiders walked along the edge of th e road. A sasquach-like creature was spotted; just as quickly, it ran to the protection of the woods. As my companion and I entered the forest, still in the car, we encountered a spacec raft. Aliens stood beside it. Pulling the vehicle over and exiting it, we received impressions from the Visitors that I/we were to continue the search. The deeper we went into the woods, the more surreal and strange the surroundings appeared. I turned my head away from my friend for a mome nt, then back; he had become a she. Intuition told me that the search I had undertaken on be half(?) of the aliens was causing problems in the 'outside' world. Compulsion caused me to c ontinue. In ever-quicken ing strides, we went over bridges that crossed streams and pushed onwards. Finally, we struggled up a hillsi de to arrive at a very small shack. Upon seeing it, I knew that it contained the \"MYALL\". Each of its four walls had a slotted door , or window ... large enough to see into and possibly crawl through. We gazed inside. Therein was a young 'baby', or baby bird in a nest. Quite large for a bird (l ike an ostrich), and sans feathers. I removed it from its nest, took it right out of the shack, and placed it on the floor of the forest. Instantly, upon touching the Earth, it aged approximately 1 year . As well, it gained colour and feathers. Classification: B41.4 - 1 Author:  Robertt  W.

Down the hill; away from the scene and towards the road, the car and people. While in flight, I was insistent -- aloud, to my companion -- that we were not in any ordinary forest. As if to prove my suspicions, a/the sasquach appeared off to one side of us an instant later. Again, it ran in the opposite direction. I hadn't recalled bringing the bird along, yet there it was with the two of us as we arrived at a road and crossed it. Running towards us was a male figure, obvious ly hostile, and covered in mud. He had a companion as well. Directing his remarks to me, he stated that I had already caused one death (in the 'outside' world), and I shouldn't ther efore complete my task. As he was speaking, music began to sound in my mind. The beat wa s not unlike the human heart, and its tempo was increasing in fury as each moment passed. I was fearful; I knew that time was at hand. I turned away from the strangers and toward s the woodland. My friend had become a male once more, though still without identity to me. I cautioned him not to risk the return trip I would be taking. Yet we both began, my comp anion actually out-pacing me. This time, the route was along a path which was totally uphill. It was covered in thick, partially melted ice ... some of which had formed into icy steps. U pon our reaching the summit, we again located the small shack. I replaced the box that was holding th e nest and bird into the structure through one of the slots. It was the sl ot directly opposite to the one fr om which I originally extracted the bird. Immediately, a baby boy appeared; on th e forest floor, outside of the shack. He began to undergo a wondrous, yet frightening, transformati on. Already garbed, he started to writhe and undulate. He was growing and ag ing rapidly. The growth appeared hideous. A strange, 'alienesque' expression came over his you ng face. He betrayed almost great age and youth simultaneously. It was time to flee that unn atural scene, and I convinced my friend to do the same. Literally head first, I dove ont o the ice-covered path. My inner wish was that I might once gain attain some degree of normalcy. But I could not leave behind that which was a part of me -- in fact, that which was me -- the baby. He came with me. I was he, and \"I\" was also the \"me\" of the terrestrial plane. As we/I plunged downward, I heard (and felt) a Voice tell me that my metamorphosis to the MYALL had left me only two hours. I took it to mean that there were only two hours left to the world as I ha d known it. As I continued down the path, vaguely aware of my friend in the background, I felt both terrified and beguiled at having finally revealed a piece of my fate. I awoke.

What follows is the vision I received during the ritual, following this invocation. This vision started shortly after I sat dow n, following my formal Ceremony of Recognition. This was not one continuous vision, blocking out the ongoing ritual -- instead the vision continued intermittently, on and off through the II recognitions that followed, and through the other activities in ritual. I faded into and out of the Conclave Ritual, al ternately participating in the ritual and wra pped up in this vision. The Vision: I look along a shore. To my le ft and extending forward as fa r as I can see, and with no horizon, is a sandy desert, hot, dry, and barren. To my right, also extending into infinity, is a dark, cold, and wet sea, quiet and brooding. There is no motion here, but the potential for motion exists. I look again, and see a desert plain extending infinitely left and right, and extending forward to the horizon above which is a full, quiet, bl ue sky. The plain abounds with scrub and desert plant life, perhaps desert animal life. The sky bears the potentia l for birds and flight, but none are seen. It is light, but I see no sun, nor shadow. I look again, and see fire, hot and wild, extending in all directions. There is no \"in front of\" nor \"in back of\" this fire, but through the fire, pe rhaps within the fire, I se e ice, cold, still, and inviolate. These two each coexist without affecting the other. I look again, and I stand on a plain, a plain of life, with plants of all kinds extending as far as I scan. Before me is a bare ar ea of sandy earth. I sq uat down and poke a hole in the earth with my right index finger. I reach down and place a s eed into this hole with my left hand. I cover the seed with earth, moving the dirt by sliding my right foot on the ground and over the hole. I lightly pat the dirt with this foot. I stand back. I bring light to shine on this ar ea, and I bring a light shower to fall upon and water this seed. I see the sprout push above the ground, and I see a shor t, young flower bloom. I look back to the three previous scenes, seeing them simultaneously. I see a flower in each, to be tended and nurtured.

Dream"},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":" The dream came after a sleepless night and occurred while I was napping, somewhere between 9:30 and 11:00 AM. It began with two characters: Magus Aquino and an unknown man. The Magus was dressed in purple. The man with whom he conferred was dressed in a short, toga-like affair. The toga and the man bot h appeared to be Roman. The toga stands out in my memory as being a beautiful deep blue, and appeared to be ve lvet. He and the Magus stood on a grassy area beside a small, canal-lik e stream. The Magus appeared interested but calm as he stood in his purple robe, listen ing to the Roman. Afte r conferring, the Magus walked in deep thought beside the water, and the Roman went off slowly in a small wooden rowboat. He was seen no more in the dream. During this time I was across the stream, observing the two mentioned above. I seemed to be in a small niche or patio or whatever that opened into a larger room at my back. Except for one break in the sequence, I remained in this area. The Magus continued to walk be side the water, apparently in deep concentration, and I was struck by the loneliness he presen ted to the eye. He appeared to have a great weight on his shoulders, and to be contemplating how to deal with whatever problem had presented itself. Then the scene changed, and it seemed to be a pl ace not too far from the grassy area with the stream, but one from which that area coul d not be seen. There was a child, whom I immediately thought of and seemed to recognize as The Child. He appeared to be somewhere between 2 and 3 years old in stature, but had a face that showed incredible age. He was dressed in a black robe with the hood up, and had around his neck the white pentagram medallion of a Setian I. He stood without assi stance. With him was another Setian, who I think was of II or above. I seemed to realize that I would shortly guard the Child for awhile, and have it for awhile, perhaps to see certain rooms somewhere not too far away in the dream. The Child appeared fully aware of what was goi ng on around it, perhaps more than the others -- except the Magus. Thinking back, it appears that their levels of consciousness were similar, though perhaps expressed outwardly in different ways. There app eared to continue to be a Setian or Setians there to protect or help to watch the Child. During this time the Magus continued to ponder something as he walked beside the water. The scene then showed a room in which I was pr esent with a small group of other Setians. On a table in the room was a stack of rather high-quality paper with a script in a red ink that brought to mind the calligraphy of the Book of Coming Forth by Night. The Child was not seen, but I sensed his presence nearby. We in th e room seemed to be taking a census of those who would be with us in some sort of coming change. I gathered that the question concerned some Setians who weren't ready for somethi ng. This would be wide-open, of course, for various interpretations; but I s eemed to know that it had to do with a possible journey -- or perhaps \"journey\" is the wrong word.

I never lost the sensation that the Child was present out of sight nearby. Alone I am alone. Completely, utterly, totally alone. I am alien to this race of man, yet I walk among them unrecognized, save by a perceptive few. My appearance is human to the uninitiated observer, but I am of the abyss and non-human in intellect and will. I have always been so but have only now succeeded in piercing the veil of illusion which has kept this knowledge from my consciousness. I now accept it, for even as I am so alone, I am at once unique and magnificent in my isolation. I can give of my lif e, my love, my very essence, yet ultimately I am, and shall ever be, alone in relation to mankind. In this I am not unique, for there are others of my race, my brothers and sisters of the shadows. Though we are each set apart and enclosed in the veil of darkness, we are at th e same instance bound each to the other, will to will, and all held sacred to and manifestations of the Prince of Darkness. We are irrevocably alien to the beings who inha bit the earth. Even as we pass among them, we carry the knowledge that we move in ways strange and secr et, and so do we cause them to perceive us as we wish and are recognized in our true nature only by others of our kind. At first, the mind quails at the enormity and significance of this realization, but once it has been faced and admitted, acceptance, and ultimately serenity and exultation follow. It is but a recognition of that which we have always known but dare no t voice lest we be thought mad. Loneliness is ever at our heels and the awaren ess of our isolation from manki nd lies heavy, but it is fleeting when matched with the magnificence of our coming into being. I am alone, yes, but there are others who walk amidst the Black Flame, and we are awesome to behold, for we have surpassed the mindless ex istence of mankind and attained the gate to Setamorphosis.

Sesheta ir Sefekht, Xeper ir Xem \"What happens,\" asked Her-Bak, \"if a man changes his name during life?\" Classification: V2 - B51 - 3 Author: Linda Thomas III° Date:  Unknown  HTML Revision: Dec 15, 1997 CE Subject: N eters; Magical Names Reading List: "},{"pageNumber":777,"pageContent":"\"The new name, if taken deliberat ely, maintains the continuity, but alters the rhythm and the man's relations with the world.\" From Her-Bak, Initiate , RL 2L When I began to call myself Sefekht, rather than Sesheta, there were several factors involved though I hardly considered them, as the change \"came about\" as it did. Though deliberate, it was more of an intuitional, reflective decision than one arrived at by consideration of any set of factors. It was only after I instituted th e change that I rea lized the meaning of Sefekht as opposed to Sesheta. And, regarding the quot e above, it was after my relati onship to the world changed that my name also changed. Sefekht, in its common definition, is \"seven\" -- the last of the \"seven inexorable numbers\" or the \"Seven Fatal Powers.\" However, the seve n inexorable numbers themselves are only the reflections of the seven primordial numbers. They are the speech which defines the thought, the representation of their own meaning. The number seven as defined in Egyptian is thus : the synthesis of the other six inexorable numbers, the term of manifestation which makes it possible through a reaction to causal impulse to manifest the qualities of all the numbe rs in the seven-fold integration (the seven colors of light, the seven essential sounds of the scale, the seven-year renewal of body cells, etc). Now this is all important, but it is only th e common definition of Sefekht, and is fulfilling only on a mundane level. Let us consider the im plications of the meaning of Sefekht, and the implication of change brought about by the chan ge from Sesheta to Sefekht and Xeper to Xem. This is nothing more than a personal interpre tation -- as that is all any of us can offer -- but I hope that its reflection will be representative of the introsp ection that must be applied to comprehend beyond the obvious, what is (after all) the bottom line in what we are doing -- \"to boldly go where no man has gone before\" ... ahem. I have lived through many things, and I reached many levels through my attempts to search out and create myself. I left \"no stone untur ned\" as it were, wreaking havoc in my own universe even, if it were necessary to reach my goals. This brought me to call myself Satania - - the devil's daughter. I lived up to my name in every way -- truly represen tative of that image as understood then. I fulfilled my namesake and became, as appropriate, Sesheta. I have opened the mysteries of my creation, and my universes continue to be filled with havoc; all stones are, however reluctantly, overturned. I ache, I fl ee, I resent my own innate curi osity. Ironic, that it was this which I love/hate in myself which has brought me to the Words and caused me to be present as they have changed, maintaining the continu ity, but altering the rhythm of Set's relations with the world. Xem is a fulfilling of Xeper; it maintains the continuity of the Aeon; yet it has with certainty changed it. I cannot but speculate on the change, but I feel that it is an internal introspective change, as Xem itself is only comp rehensible after its perception."},{"pageNumber":778,"pageContent":"With the change, I personally have felt a deep er need to work on myself. Because of my perception of Xem, I feel that th is way of thinking is in keepi ng with its edict. I feel as though I have been weaned, and am on my own now, that Set has cut the umbilical cord -- and I am free, freer than ever before. I am frightened, exhilarated, and feel illimitabl e possibilities within my reach. It's terrifying, because my life has changed -- drastically. To all outward appearances I am the same. But inside, I am subtly becoming awar e that I am not subject to a gr eater will. Sounds like a lot of fun, but certainly it is more than that. Tr ue self-reliance is a hard lot -- and a big responsibility. However, it's all I've got, because at this point the br idges have all burned behind me. My present attitude is coincidental with th e uttering of the new word. Certainly, I cannot identify the degree of effect the world has had in bringing about this change. I myself have brought it about, as the reaction to certain causal impulses ... like the Black Flame, and a word uttered by an Opened Mouth. Setian Participation in Xeper At midnight of Summer Solstice XVII, at the Gold Ledge campground on the Kern River in California, I held a ritual whose purpose was th e examination of the Principle of Xeper. The ritual opening was a variation of my personal opening to the ten directions 1 , with Set invited to witness and participate as he W illed. I then evoked Shu, and invoked Tefnut, Geb, and Nut (Nuit).

Instead, everything changes at least a little, partaking of Xeper, and everything re mains somewhat the same, partaking of the Immutable. Change is continuous and pervasive throughout the objective univers e. Weather becomes stormy and then clears. The egg becomes the wriggler who becomes the mosquito. A sphere of gas becomes a fiery star and then a relativ ely cool dwarf. Child becomes Man. We do not recognize these changes as Xeper. They ar e beautiful but natura l, worldly, mundane reflections of the Principle. All change is a manifestation of Xeper, and every being and every object undergoes change. Change is the manifestation of Xeper. Willfu lly embraced change is the Function of Xeper. Every being that Willfully seeks and causes change Xepers; such beings actively participate in Xeper, and share in the neter's Function. The manifestation of Xeper is Change (noun). Th e Function of Xeper is To Change (verb). The Function of Xeper is to change one's se lf and to change the universe (objective and subjective), to actively cause change. To passi vely be changed is to be part of the manifestation of Xeper, but not to Function as and within Xeper. (Hindus talk of the Dance of Shiva, the continual motion of the universe and all its components. Indian mystics seek to witness, understand, and be one with the changing universe, to accept change, to accept the dance as it occurs. The Setian instead seeks to dance with Shiva, to be a partner, causing ch ange in addition to being changed.) There are two levels of willful Xeper: becoming better (or worse) at what one is, and becoming more (or less) than what one is. Becoming 'more' than you are is not more desira ble than becoming 'better' than you are; these are different levels and aspects of Xeper, differe nt orders of Xeper, but neither is better nor worse than the other. An Adept who learns new techniques, who becomes better at Magick, becomes a better Adept, but is still an Adept. An Adept who b ecomes a Priest of Set has added new aspects to his being, has become more complex. Becoming Priest is becoming more than an Adept. The Priest is still an Adept, but one who has incorporated additional complexities into his Being. The Priest may be a better Adept (more able to work the magick of an Adept), may be a worse Adept (less able to work such magick), or may not find significant changes in his Adept qualities. The primary difference is that this Adept is now also a Priest. Becoming Magister, Magus, or Ipsissimus is likew ise becoming more than the previous stage, more complex, with additional attributes. We place value judgments on directions of ch ange. Becoming better than you are is more desirable than becoming worse, and becoming more than you are is more desirable than"},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"becoming less, for these are our values. But reme mber that all changes in all directions are manifestations of Xeper. Setian Xeper must be willfully directed. We must willfully work to Xeper. We must direct our Xeper. But must we see the goal which results from Xeper? The Adept is not a Priest, and by definition he does not know the Being of the Priest. Therefore the Adept can not guide his Xeper directly towards Priesthood. Yet the Setian Adept must Xeper, and must direct his Xeper, toward better Adepthood. Each act of Xeper, each act chosen for its growth potential, must be chosen carefully and intelligently. Each chosen path must be followed willfully and diligently. Each chosen path must be regularly reviewed to verify the continued desirability of that path. If enough Xeper occurs in enough suitable direc tions, then the Adept finds himself becoming a Priest 3 . Yes, Xeper must be directed, but this does not mean that Xeper flows only in a single direction, nor that willfully dir ected Xeper is predictable Xeper. We find that Xeper, no matter how carefully directe d, often takes us to situ ations and states of being that we can not predict. Xepera has ma ny states, and the paths of Xeper lead in many unexpected directions. Xeper between states is a differe nt order of Xeper, a 'higher' order of Xeper, than change within a state. The potential of this Xeper be tween states is greater. This Xeper is more magical, partaking more of the gift and essen ce of Set, more of the essence of Xeper. This Xeper is also less frequent, harder to cont rol, and more dangerous. It is more dangerous, but not too dangerous. Indeed, the Adept within th e Temple of Set has already undergone such Xeper, faced such dangers, for in this manner has the Adept become more than Human, become an Adept of the Temple of Set. Through the use of the Gift of Set, and through actively pursuing and participating in Xeper, the Setian Adept has become more complex, more powerful, has become part of the Function of Xeper, and has made the Function of Xeper part of that Adept's Being.

Rite of Balance"},{"pageNumber":781,"pageContent":" I had thought long and hard about th e principles of equals or bala nce, as it pertained to me. After the Conclave, I decided to do a working based on those concepts. Shu and Tefnut were the archetypes of balance that I felt I needed to work on. I thought that if I did a devotional rite of these god forms, I would ge t some kind of results. I did. Magister Menschel had asked me a battery of questions about my Xeper. This is how I planned to bring the reality of my Xeper into manifestation. The following working is a result of those questions from Magister Menschel. Certain African religions initia te an Adept into their systems by a method of trance induction. The devotee is put into a state of hypnosis wher eby his astral body goes into the nether world to seek information of importance to himself. Sometimes the god form is brought into this reality by means of drumming or dancing. On ce the adept is posse ssed, the god or goddess begins to speak. During the speech the informa tion that is given will guide the adept on the correct path, thereby enhancing his/her Xeper. Such were the results of this rite. The operation was performed over a 30-day period with the actual rite being done on the last day of the month. I took pictures of Shu and Tefnut, and meditate d on the principles of Balance. I opened the Temple in the usual manner of the Temple of Set. I invoked the archetypes of Shu and Tefnut, a nd I found myself trave ling out of my body. I had the feeling of extreme acce leration, and traveling straight up. There was a temple or pyramid type of building. I saw steps ascending ve rtically, and I began to climb the stairs. As I climbed, I felt like part s of my personality were being st ripped away. They seemed almost like outmoded ways of thinking or activity. Finally I was at the top of th is structure, and an opening appeared. I went through this doorway into a hall or middle chamber of some sort. There were rows and rows of tall columns, different colors and shapes (I did no t understand the significan ce of this). I walked on, each chamber leading to another chamber. It's funny, I could hear the clicking of my heels on the marble floor. With each sound my shoes made came a different message. (Every now and then one of those messages rises to my c onscious mind. Funny, that they seem so trivial now.) I came to the entrance of the main chamber. There were hieroglyphics around this door. Some of them I could make out, and others I'd neve r seen before. Some were Enochian, some an alphabet of daggers, and some were runes. Intu itively I got the message that this had to do with the \"Truth of my Soul.\" (All this time I was trying to remain objective, but I had the Classification: V2 - B54.BR - 1 Author: Justin Kaan I° Date:   December,   XXVI   Subject:   Balance   Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"feeling that this was the cross ro ads of my spirituality.) As I passed the door I found myself in a dark room, and there before me was a huge scal e. The scale was all go ld and dark, if dark can be considered a color. It wasn't black in th e sense of black, but more like a purple color. It felt like the womb. The reason I was so aware of these colors was that there was a feathe r on one side of the scale. It had in itself so many different colors, and each color told a stor y (perhaps the story of many different life times). On the other side was a vase, a clear, almost glass-like container. In the vessel was a man-creature, or so I thought. Every time I blinked my eyes, the figure changed. Behind this scale were seated two fi gures, whom I believed to be Shu and Tefnut. One figure was a man, but seemed at times to be a boy. Strong, articulate, and beautiful. The other being was a woman who seemed at times to be middle aged and at other times to be elderly, but not ugly. She maintained an air of great composure and dignity. Each one of those beings addressed me in turn, but yet they spoke with one voice. They were trying to make me understand the laws of universal balance. They showed me a pool of water whereby I could see my past and th e things I needed to learn about myself and my mode of action, so as not to repeat the sa me mistakes. They taught me the true art of touching that future part of my self that is to be yet made manifest. They made me sit upon a throne and then spoke again. What follows is on ly a fragment of what I heard, the rest having highly personal messages: Let those who do not live in truth beware. L earn that there is a certain harmony in your actions; when you oppose this harmony you accumulate guilt. To learn your Xeper is not to bring you pain, but joy and happiness. This need less suffering may be true for some, but not for you. You have passed the trial of fire and purification. You must look upon the darker side of your nature. You cannot remove it and cannot ignore it, for if you did it would gain power over you. Nurture it and trust it, for it will help you to survive. (1) Harness that power. To face the trials ahead you must discover the Will to endure and survive. It doesn't matter if one lives or dies; this is th e most difficult lesson, as there is no foe to fight, no aspect of myself to alter or develop. The lesson will take on a new and incomprehensible direction (2) . If the will to Xeper is there you may take a new path. You must have commitment to that course of action without reservation or hesitati on. If you will reach the desired end. The will to survive has to be de veloped. You will be shadowed by death, close enough to be touched. Every day you must face death. One dies to one's old life to be born anew. Contemplate the magnitude of space and view your encounters from that distance, thereby gaining ascendancy over situations and drama. This is the closest a living being can come to the level of existence of the Ka and inbetween. Crossing the abyss separates you from the Adept. In this abyss there is no light, no darkness, nor time or space or form. It is like the nothingness of total annihilation, but it is not. It will be the most difficult test along YOUR path. You mu st climb out of that abyss; this you have already done; what's past is past .

The Freedom Working Purpose: The purpose of this working was to release me from guilt and unwanted fears that I was not consciously aware of, but that affect ed my life nonetheless. Before performing the ritual, the existe nce of these fears was only deduced by myself through symptoms such as (slightly) self-destructive actions a nd other similarly subtle signs. Preparation: I decided to make quite a big deal out of this working, since I knew that it would possibly have operative ramifications fo r a long time (not to mention the subjective boost one gets when attaching great im portance to anything in this way). I wrote out all of the ins and outs of my Will on a piece of parchment in calligraphy (or rather my version of it) and in poetic form, to be bur ned and sent into the f ourth dimension. I also purchased a brand new pair of handc uffs just for the ritual, as they were never to be profaned afterward or be demoted to being just one of my weird toys. I also acquired a small metal pentagram from a friend (home-made) and painte d it black; then I tied to it a key which was to open the handcuffs and thereby represent my freedom. Finally, I found a wooden box with skull clasps at a thrift store, a perfect permanent storage place for the \"Souvenirs of Freedom\" that would be put away to carry on the ritual long after its initiation.

Then I set up my altar. I decided to use the old SB white candle on the right and the black candle on the left, since guilt a nd fear were to be represented. Therefore I placed the cuffs before the white candle, and the key of freedom in front of the black candle. I placed the parc hment behind me where I could not see it, to represent information I could not know or have access to until breaking free of my bonds of fear. (I forgot to turn off my fire alarm, and it we nt off during the ritual, forcing me to jump up suddenly out of practically a trance and rip it out of the ceiling. Mora l: Unplug fire alarms when burning parchment!) Procedure: The loose outline I used, with the exception of the contents of the parchment follows: 1. Light candles (The Black Flame, and, in this case, the white flame also). 2. Ring the Bell. 3. Point the Blade, Invoke. 4. Put on Handcuffs. 5.

Ring Bell. 12. \"So it is done.\" Needless to say, much more than just what wa s included in the outline above happened during the ritual. I added a little \"knife dance\" to ce lebrate my Freedom; since martial arts are one of my major interests it just seemed natural. The ritual ended up taking quite a long time, which was something I completely lost track of duri ng the ritual. Afterwards I was so worn out I could not even put my room back together before falling asleep. Results: (1) One important result has been the realization / apprecia tion of many fears of which I was not before consciously aware. They were not just dissolved, as I had expected, but rather they were exposed to me, so I could face them and overcome them myself. To have my cake and eat it too. I have had great success, and I have heightened my state of mental ease to great heights. This ritual has greatly enhanced my Xeper, a nd I have even done some smaller rituals as results of this greater one.

We are all individuals!\"), and came into being immediately after the Second Inte rnational Conclave of the Temp le of Set (6/22/XV). As the rite is a glorification of the Self, yet is inte nded for group ritual, each task prior to the passing of the cup must be performed by one individual alone. There must be no choruses of \"Hail, Set\" or \"Xeper\". Should anyone wish to res pond to such a statement, he must look into himSelf and find his unique and individual response, for instan ce: \"Hail, Set! I thank you, great teacher.\" The key is that any words chosen must be appropriate to the individual at the moment of speaking. The words \"we\" and \"us\" should be avoided during the individual portions of the ritual. As there can be no rote responses, roles should be chosen well prior to the meeting at which the ritual is to be performed, and copies of this rite should be distributed to all participants. If this is not feasible, the ritual should be discussed at the beginning of the meeting, and at least a half-hour should be allocated fo r the participants to work out their roles and to examine their natures/neteru. It is preferable to discuss the roles individually, so th at each participant may have maximum flexibility to select a role with in the context of the ritual as a whole. The elements of the Ritual of the Self may be performed in any order, save that the passing of the chalice and that which follows must be done last.

Rather, enough elements must be added to give each person a complete task. Part icipants who desire to approach the altar are encouraged to do so during their initial presen tations, rather than in a later, open period. Presumably this will help to economize th e overall performance time. The ritual is nevertheless inappropriate for very large groups. There should be a mirror on or near the altar. It is preferable that the performer of each el ement bring his own materials for that element. The Priest should provide the chalice.

After a moment of silent contemplation, the Priest indicates that the ritual music may be started.

I would strike the be ll of separation, that each may recognize his individuality and separation fr om the morass of mankind. [Priest:] Are you not then an individual and a Setian? Have you not heard the Words? Thelema -- Indulgence -- Xeper -- in your own unique way.

I have been told that using mirrors in ritual is dangerous, damn right it is! Everything we are doing is dangerous. Upon looking into the mirror, I suddenly hear d the voice of Anton S zandor LaVey. In his deep, tonal voice, he was saying, I stand before the tarnished facades of your haughtiest moral dogmas, and I proclaim: Lo and behold, all this is false!. It was obvious to me that hearing this at that time wa s not a reference to the Chri stian philosophies. Nor was it a reference to the people with w hom we share the world, those we commonly call \"Them\". It was a reference to ME -- or, more correctly, my Harwer. The same Harwer that I call Linda.

He had a grasp of the philosophy which exceeded the primer Satanic Bible comprehension level. 2) Emotionally, there was conf lict. \"I was raised a Cathol ic,\" he would often whine plaintively.

In the days that followed, I began to see a ch ange -- a metamorphosis if you will. Thereafter, whenver F. expressed guilt or attempted to suppress his ego, I would gleefully whip out the parchment, hold it up to him, and exclaim, \"It really doesn't matter, 'cause you're going to hell anyway !\" A great big smile would come across the young man's face. Reason would make it all seem so very foolish! And yet, the Subjective Mind was listening! The aforementioned \"conflict of intere st\" soon vanished. His Will was unified! The results were permanent! Ironically, it is not the conscious \"rational\" mi nd which restricts and inhibits the Will of the magician, it is the mystical, \"irrational\" mind. This real ization is echoed in some correspondence I received from Shuti a while back: Gnosis and Reason squabble here ... if this is the case, then why don't we exercise this (absolute) power? Gnosis rationa lizes that it's because we haven't learned to flex the muscle yet, or because some psychological force (2) within this as-yet faulty mind of mine refuses to accept my power.

I began the Working slowly, with Death and Transfiguration by Richard Strauss in the background, a new black candle ablaze upon th e altar, and the Onyx Tablet of Set in my hands. I opened the Gates of th e Angles, and read from the Third Key of Xem (1) . When I came to the quotation from the \"Statement of Belial\" of The Diabolicon , I read it aloud, though softly. Upon reaching the end of the Key, I gazed at my reflection in the Mirror of Remembrance, and focussed on knowing that \"Str anger which I call Atmu, and that which is Atmu-set-t.\" The tape ended, and I switched to Stravinsky's The Rites of Spring . I found myself looking back on the Working atop Xemset of the North Solstice XVI, during which I affirmed my desire and Will to Xem. I felt the need to extinguish my lone candle, and suddenly felt myself plunging through a maelst rom of color and sensation, as though passing through the dimensions. My glowing skull, which resides in the background, and whose reflection may be seen in my altar mirror, b ecame the symbol of that Fear which must be overcome if the Quest for Xem is not to end in disaster. And I realized that I had overcome that fear, though it would yet retu rn time and again to contest with me. The skull is in my chamber by my Will, and glows by my leave, it is nothing more than a tool for my use, even as fear is a tool for protection and for the strengthening of the Will. The skull having become insignificant, my atte ntion was brought to the glowing charcoal on my incense burner. As I focussed on it, I realized that here was a True sy mbol of the Flame of Atmu. It is intensely hot, but wa stes neither light nor heat outside of wher e it is needed. And it endures. I observed the reflection of this \"flame\" in my mirror, and Knew that this was a case in which the reflection was as important as the \"origina l\", and perhaps could transcend it (the analogy obviously does not hold, but is True for the flam e of which I speak). I re alized that the flame is inextricably tied to the Black Flame of Set, and that I hold the flame within me, never to be extinguished. Classification: V2 - B55.RI - 1 Author: Corey S.

So what's so new and important about that, huh?) I have recently read a book by Lyndon Hardy, entitled Master of the Five Magics , in which the protagonist is on a Quest which necessitates th at he master each of the five forms of magic on his world in turn. (2) The realization that I came to on this Equinox Work ing is that I myself am passing through a series of Alxemical transformations, all of which I must complete before I will truly Know and Understand what I am. (Yes, I know, no one ever said it would be easy.) In my role of Diancecht, the Physician of the Gods, I became a master of the watery forces and compassion, and thus (or perhaps unrel ated) passed from the I to the II. In my role as Atmu-set-t, I have become a mast er of the flame, and of the powers of Lust and Strength. This is a bit different from \"merely\" Knowing that the Black Flame is within me; it is an intrinsic connection with flame in genera l, and the Black Flame and Flame of Atmu in particular, that I will constantly feel within me. I have step ped into the fire and emerged unscathed. But this is not an end, merely one more tool to use on my Quest. I saw a doorway, and knew that I am passing through anothe r transition, perhaps truly star ting on the Quest for Xem. The Quest ion, as Magus Barrett so succinc tly put it: Who is Atmu, and What am I? The answer is \"All Things\" -- not the Christian co p-out of \"all things to all people,\" but truly All Things -- and yet none of those which currently are known (I just now am beginning to see a connection with \"the God whose Name is not known\" here). I feel certain that the next st age of my quest lies with the element of Air, though I do not yet know in what way this will come about (save through lots of work and Work, but you already know that one, I'm sure!) Don't worry. I'm not switching magickal names or anything. The Flame of the Night Sun I am and shall be. (3) I suspect that something may come about during the Rite of the Undead when we \"perform\" it this Hallowe'en. I saw a great bat, and realized that there is yet more in the Vampire than I have yet seen, that in his forms of the bat and of gas he represents th e triumph of the Air over the Earth (and yet there is balance, and he must re turn to the soil each day). It is in quest of the nature of the Undead where I now proceed, and I suspect that I will find more of myself at the \"end\" of that trail -- and another quest as well. Footnotes: 1.

As the title would imply, our hero found it not so. Though, in fact, he was actually a master of none by the end of the book, merely a talented dilettante in all. But that's neither here nor there. 3. Incidentally, I will not be founding an Orde r of Atmu-set-t, but an Order of Atmu ... Atmu-set-t is merely the aspect which I am, not the essence of the Neter, any more than Merensexmet would be considered to be the Creator of the Order of Merensexmet -- his is the Order of Sexmet, as is right.

How the \"Proclamation of I Shall Be\" Remanifested On November 11, XXVII A.S., Magistra Reynolds, Magister Menschel, and I gathered to perform a Xem Working, as it was the sixteen th anniversary of the Original XemSet Working. (1) Since the Set-XIII Conclave, each of us in our own way (and other Setians as well) had perceived or sensed a new dimension to the call of Xem within the Temple and Aeon of Set. Thus we created a G.B.M. Working to invoke Xem of the Past into the Present, that by reflection upon it we might gain some \"p rophetic\" insight into th e direction of Xem, present to future. During the physical working I spoke aloud only on ce, and for a short duration, so the others could hear the thoughts passing through my min d. For most of the Working I was active etherically and/or astrally, allowing my physical body to symbolize my lesser human self become passive, while Higher Man came into Be ing. The whole experience became intensely dreamlike for me, as in a lucid dream when th e \"laws\" of the physical plane no longer bind the creativity of the Self. Instead, dream-laws rei gned and the astral poten tials become actual. Through this I experienced Xem of the Past, Present, and Possible Futures in what seemed to be an \"Eternal Moment.\" The \"Bridge\" or Gate of Xem had become establis hed in the perceptions of my heart. I could \"see\" the First XemSet Working as Magistra Reynolds read it aloud. I could \"see\" the Xem Working of that Night, through the Dark Realm of the Pentagram of Set, as the collective work of Setians elsewhere in time-space of that evening. So too in the Presence of Set within Tehuti I could see, hear, feel, know, and perhaps for the briefest of moments was in Xem of my individual Self and those Selves who collect ively are yet to Be -- hence Xem as the Future Creation in potentia. I could perceive so much in one \"never e nding,\" forever Becoming moment, that it was impossible to speak of the meta-dimensional \"reality\" of Xem in terms of finite reason while yet perceiving it. As infinite beauty, harmony, st rength, passion, and all th at perhaps could be termed an ecstasy of Becoming, it was an expe rience I did not want to \"end.\" \"Beware of stasis in Nirvana,\" Tehuti said to me."},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"Thus as the Working was closed my Will was not completely in the closing of the Gate; I did not feel that I was finished, and perhaps I feared not entering into that state again. In any case, my part of the Working was not complete. After the formal closing of the Rite, I still could not say much relevant to my experience. In a manner I feel I was undergoing an alxemical process initiated in the Working. But later, while riding back to Sacramento with Magister Menschel, I spoke to him my will to write my own \"Proclamation of I Shall Be\" to ex press Tehuti, as I could not relate to many of the statements of the \"IAM Manuscript.\" He confirmed that the Manuscript was the expression of the IAM of Anubis, not of he or I or any other Setian; though perhaps we might share some similar expression of Ma'at. The following morning, after the Xem Working and my expression of desire to write my own \"Proclamation of I Shall Be,\" I awoke with the inspiration to write it -- the result of that inspiration is before you and me now. Thus this Proclamation is the fruit of the Xem Working and the alxemical process which followed in the speaking of my Will to MySelf. Such a tool of a personal invoc ation of the Neter of oneself, I feel, acts very much like a \"Declaration of Independence\" and \"Constitution\" of Becoming the Neter. In the Quest of Xem (or the Graal of Self), one may use su ch a \"Proclamation of Will\" as guidelines (consistencies) governing the al xemical process of Becoming the Neter. Moreso, as one passes through the cycles of Xeper and Re manifestation, probing deeper into the Mysterium of Self in Xem, he can amend this Procla mation to reflect his ne w understanding of Self Becoming. Perhaps my own \"Proclamation of I Shall Be\" will kindle the desire in other Setians to create their own, as a magical tool in their Xeper and Remanifstion. If one fellow Setian is so affected, then my sharing of this most personal document will not have been in vain. May Set be with you in your Ques t for eternity in yourSelf!

S upport for these outcomes will also be derived from historical evidence as in quotes from Setian materials. The concepts, exercises, and conclusions drawn in this paper are my own, coming from the thoughts of a first degree Setian with less than tw o months membership in the Temple of Set. Useful criticism, suggestions, and correc tions are fully expected and welcomed. What is Willpower? Most people commonly use the statement, \"I don't have enough willpower,\" when they describe their inability to quit smoking, follow so me diet, or change other habits they may have. This implies that most people know what willpower is , and yet, I do not believe they do. In fact, there are probably ve ry, very few people who can clea rly define, on a practical level what willpower actually is. Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1972) defines willpower as \"energetic determination: resoluteness\", and this hints at a useful definition. I simply like to divide the word into its two parts \"will\" and \"power\". \"Will\" is simply making a decision. Decision comes from the Latin DECISIO, which means \"to divide apart\". When we have many choices to select from, we must divide away all those choices we will not take from the one we will. \"Will\", then, means to select a specific action to execute, a decision. \"Power\" (again from Webster's) is \"ability to act or produce an effect\". In other words, \"power\" is taking action, pure and simple. Therefore, \"willpower\" means to decide and to take action. Most humans lack willpower for two reasons. Firs t, they substitute an unwillingness to make a decision in the first place which, of course, pr events the possibility of taking action. Second, they do not have any understanding of who could be performing the act of willpower upon what entities! (As shall soon become clear, when I capitalize \"Will\" and refer to it as the Will, I am referring to the capacity of a person who exer cises authentic willpower as it is honed and polished via the reinforcement of the person's true Identity.) When, however, the decision is made (such as to stop smoking) , and then the human fails to succeed in taking action, we see very clearly th e importance of willpower. It is my opinion that most humans have more answers than they need for the problems they complain of. Their lack of willpower comes not so much from not deciding upon a particular strategy or answer, but from failing to take action. Most humans talk about taking actions but seld om do so. We will uncover here what I believe to be the single most important cause for the fa ilure to take action, how to correct that cause, and some of its implications for experienci ng success in relationships, acquiring financial success, and the creation of a permanent pers onality through the forging of the Will."},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"The Blocks to Action When we select (will) a specifi c goal, there are a series of ne cessary actions which must be taken to accomplish that goal. I like to diagram this situation like this: YOU – BLOCKS – GOAL Between you and the achievement of any goal th ere are commonly blocks. These blocks can be subjective (your emotions, your thoughts) or objective (physical barriers, inadequate money, other people, etc.). Most humans believe that willpower consists of gritting their teeth a nd attempting to smash directly through the blocks to th eir goals. If they call this te eth gritting behavior \"positive thinking\", then they usually a ttempt to pretend that the blocks don't even exist in the first place! As we shall soon see, however, true willpower does not attempt to focus upon the blocks and then smash through them, nor does true willpower attempt to delude the mind into ignoring the existence of those bloc ks. Instead, true willpower redefines the identify of you , which reveals the inability of the blocks to actually block you , first on a normal human level, and then upon the level we refer to as Greater Black Magic (G.B.M.). Before we continue, please pause for just a moment and consider the following thought: If you could remove or neutra lize all of the blocks which currently stand between you and what you desire, what would your life be like? Think about it. The Essential Deidentification Process What we will examine now is crucial to the purpose of this paper. Warning! Do not assume you fully comprehend th is process in the first reading, or that you already know about it! 1. Given: Experience X. 2. Metaquestion: \"Who knows about X?\" 3. If answer is \"I do\", then... 4. You are not X. I'm going to assume that you are reading this paper yourself. Do you know you are not this physical paper which you have been reading from? If you agree that you are not this paper then we can continue. (If you do not agree, and in some way can't distinguish between yourself and th is paper, I would sugge st that in at least"},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"our society you are having extreme psychotic tende ncies and need a psychiatric evaluation, at worst, or need to get serious a bout our discussion, at best.) (In our culture, as perhap s in every culture, the person's identity field determines their sanity or insanity. In our culture, a person is expected to identify w ith his family roles of son or daughter, mother, father, sister, brot her etc., his role as a taxpayer , as an automobile driver, if licensed, etc. Whenever any person denies his iden tity roles, he endangers his sanity status in the eyes of others. For exampl e, if a policeman gives you a speeding ticket but you deny that you are a driver, that policeman is going to seriously question your sanity.) Let me return to this paper. Let us assure you agree that you are not this paper. I agree with you. But how do you know you are not this paper? (Here you can stump most humans for quite some time. I held a two-day seminar in 1976 on personal power and spent over twelve hours, all of a Saturday, from 9 a.m. to after 9 p.m., letting a small group of very frustrated humans struggle to answer this question correctly.) The answer is, simply enough, that you know you are not this paper because you can experience this paper through your various senses. Y ou can see this paper and likewise hear, feel and perhaps even taste and smell this paper. In other words, you are asking yourself the questi on, whether you ever realized this before or not, \"Who knows about this paper?\" If you can truthfu lly answer \"I know about this paper,\" then you know that you are not the paper. (After all, who knows about it?) The reason you can conclude that you are not th e object you are experiencing, is derived from the structure of language. You are saying in e ffect that \"I – EXPERIENCE – X\" in the structure of \"SUBJECT – PREDICATE – OBJECT\". By definition, the subject cannot be the object. For example, \"The hammer hits the nail,\" does not permit a confusion between the identity of the hammer and the identity of the nail. If you had some kind of hammer with a point which made it capable of hitting itself, a correct sentence would describe the id entity difference between the h itting part of the hammer and the part receiving the blow as in, \"The upper pa rt of the hammer hit the lower part of the hammer.\") Therefore, it is vitally impor tant to recognize that if you as a subject experience some phenomena then you know that you are not that phenomena. The structure of language which permits you to mentally code and describe you r experience defines very automatically your non-identification with your experience. The nature of the mind to identify an experience is only possible because the mind can recognize or assign a boundary to the experience. Anything outside that boundary is not that experience. The mind can identify any experience, incl uding the elements which make up the mind (thoughts). In fact, the mind can, through language , place a boundary around the whole of the"},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"Universe (subjective and objective), thereby identifying the Universe. So the point is, what is outside that identifying boundary? The answer is, of course, you are . Of course, the \"you\" we are talking about is a different \"you\" than what you normally consider to be your identity. Already we have considered th e fact that you are not your beha viors, your roles in life. (Who knows about your behaviors? You do. Therefore you are not your behaviors any more than you are this paper). Further, we can examine other aspects of what you may have formerly considered to be your identity. For example, do you know about your physical body? Of course, you can see it, feel it, etc. Who knows about it? You do. Therefore you cannot be your body. So, too, with the emotions. Who knows about your emotions? You do. Therefore you cannot be your emotions. It is curiously liberating to realize that you have never been tired, sleepy, bored, angry, jealous, embarrassed, afraid. It is also very cu rious to recognize that you have also never been happy, exhilarated, contented, or any other \"des irable\" emotion or behavior. You may have experienced these things, but you never were these things. Soon the tremendous value of this realization for the development of the Will shall be made clear. Then, finally, there is your mind with its vari ous subsets (your personality, memories, habits, etc.). The mind seems to consist of various sense representations. (The representational systems of neurolinguistic programming seem to cover the contents of the mind fairly well. See Appendix I of Trance Formations by Grinder & Bandler, 1981, R eal People Press, for a succinct explanation.) Who knows about these sense representations, these thoughts? You do. Th erefore you are not your mind. Concerning the self being ot her than the mind, from The Crystal Tablet of Set (1) we see (page 6), \"It (the self) is the 'ultimate you', that th rough the machinery of your physical brain moves your arms and legs, sees through your eyes, hears through your ears, and in other ways interacts with the obj ective universe.\" Also (page 6), \"It (the self) has a sense of id entity, a sense of uniqueness, a sense of distance and differentiation from everyt hing else that exists.\" I might add that my mind exists, and by following the exercises to come one can feel that same \"sense of distance\" from one's own mind. Let's review what we have learned thus far. First, from the Essential Deidentificati on Process we have demonstrated that:"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"Anything you can know about cannot be you. You are not your actions. You are not your body. You are not your emotions. You are not your mind. We will deal with that question I can hear coming up (\"Well, who or what am I?\") later in this paper. For now, let's run with what we have and see where it can take us. Taking Action The possibility of control can only exist if you are not that which you wish to control. This is exactly the opposite of what most humans believe is true. They will banter on endlessly about being resolute, determined, a leader, a take-action person, etc. They perpetually lecture on the value of being strong, brave, hard-wor king, persevering, etc. This is exactly my point. All this blather about self-esteem as the absolute bottom line for any successful human undertaking is insane! To esteem the self in this case means to measure what you are ( not what you do !) against former actions by you or actions by others. In this way, humans quickly come to identify themselves with their failures , and believe themselves to be failures. If I am sitting on a chair, that chair is doomed to have the qualities of a chair as long as it remains what it is ... a chair. Adjustment of what it is isn't possible. Yet I, who am sitting in that chair, am not the visible qu alities of my behaviors or body, and I can change what I do with these instruments which I use! What I do may \"fail\", but that can be changed. What I am isn't up for evaluation. (Remember, we haven't even gotten around to finding out what that Identity is, so how can you compare or rate it?). If I am riding on a horse and I somehow believe that I am the horse, then I will have no real control over the horse. The horse might decide to go left when I had wanted to go right and I would therefore experience an \"overwhelming ur ge from somewhere inside me\" to go left. Now if I recognize that I am not the horse, I'll recognize an oppos ition to my will if the horse tries to go to the left, and I will pull his reins to the right, because that is where I want to go! Please recognize that the horse will not oppose my will if he realizes that I am the rider, because the bit in his mouth is my natural c ontrol over him. If he decides to try and oppose me, I will simply demonstrate that he never had any choice in the matter. (Bits can really hurt an obstinate horse!) This example applies to all of the possession s you may have formerly identified with: your actions, body, emotions and mind."},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"By realizing that these are your tools and not your identity, yo u can use these tools as you want to, and not as they might desire. This leads us to a truly amazing revelation: What you choose to do (volition) is done by y ou alone, and is not influenced in any way by any experience which you can know about. The thought which pops into your awareness a nd wants you to not do some action you have already decided upon, this thought cannot make you do or not do the decided action. The thought can only attempt to convince you to alter your decision. Th e thought lacks all power to act. Only you possess this power to act. In other words, nothing can make you choose to act. Only you act or refrain from acting. The blocks we referred to earlier which separate you from your desired goals can't block you ... unless you believe they can! If you believe you are blocked, then you won't take action. And here we see another 100% reversal from th e beliefs of most humans. Humans are always complaining about the situations which prevent them from having things the way they want them. \"If it only wasn't for .......... (fill in the blank)\" How many humans do you know who complain about proble ms they already know how to solve, but claim there are \"reasons\" (blocks) which prevent them from acting ? My favorite quoted block is \"I'm just that way.\" Now that's identification! Of course, the point here is that once you recognize that you ar e not what you do, the relationship between your goals and your current situation changes. The Secret The secret is to (1) decide upon your goal (w ill), and (2) act to put it into effect, while doing nothing about any \"blocks\" to your action. For example, what if you decide to study a mar tial art for whatever reasons, but one of the \"blocks\" is physical pain. What you do is (1) deci de to train in the art, and (2) begin training, while the pain goes on . (Who knows about the pain? Y ou do. Therefore you are not the pain.) In this example, you choose to do what you want to do and not what the pain wants you to do. Please read the above sentence at least one more time. Thank you. The secret is that as you c ontinue to choose (will), to act upon what you want to do, and not what various elements of your body and mind want you to do, you extinguish the blocks to your will. As you continue to extinguish blocks to your will, your mind (and therefore your body, emotions and actions) no longer block you (by de finition), and you begin to realize your Will. You reinforce your willpower actions by continui ng to deidentify from former blocks to your choices, and this reinforcement process creates an immutable Will."},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"(If you have already read my earlier paper, \"A Three-Dimens ional Model of Possible Human Experience\", then you will recognize that th e forging of the Will is movement along the dimension of Control, which also implies, du e to the influence of other major Vectors, movement along the dimension of Awareness. Let me simply point out that in a lucid dream you know you are not what you experience in that dream.) There is a peculiar enjoyment which we experi ence as we exercise the Will and develop its strength. This stems from the sense that we l ook at former problems or blocks as opportunities to exert our personal power upon th e Universe, to mold the Univer se into the shape we would desire it to be. For reasons I will shortly discuss, it is my be lief that a special subset of the mind, a new \"core\" personality, grows out of this reinforc ing pleasure of exerting and extending the Will. All that we call heroic stems from this exercise of the Will. The hero will accomplish his goal despite pain, fear or injury. He will not be stopped by blocks, but will continue on to his chosen (Willed) goal. Walking the World Thus far we have used words to demonstrate the Deidentification Process, but in order to move into this unique state of consciousness, I ha ve created several useful aids or exercises. The most important thus far has been a view point-changing sensory exercise I call Walking The World (WTW). The human commonly identifies with almost everyt hing he encounters. If he watches a movie, he will forget about the theater, the audience and his own body, while he identifies with the characters in the film. If he goes to work at hi s job, he will identify with the role of his job to the exclusion of his other life roles. The human doesn't live in his body, but lives in a mental hallucinatory world that may (s omewhat) reflect his world. Try this. Wherever you are, slowly twist your head from left to right, back and forth while asking yourself, \" What is moving? \" Do it now. Did you say that your head is moving? Then do it again, Did you say your neck is moving, or that muscle s of your body are moving? Then do it more. Did you try to second guess me and say \"The mind is moving\"? Well this isn't Zen, and do it again. What is moving? Well, if you will stop operating from an internal picture of yourself acting, and instead look , you will realize that the room, the things around your body, those are what is moving! If you don't see this yet, do it some more until you do."},{"pageNumber":811,"pageContent":"When you were very young, perhaps you remember sitting in a car or bus and watching the world move by. Or even now, when you fly in a jet, you can see the clouds rush past your window where you are. This idea of being located somewhere specific (a nd this specific location being the Center of all the Universe) goes hand in glove with the Deidentification Process. If you live in a mental perspective disassociated from your direct experience, then it is quite easy to become identified with all of the elements of that \"dream\", in much the same way we can go to a movie and forget we exist in the th eater. At the same time, by Being in a centered location, which I call being behind the eyes (BTE), our sensory e xperience acts with our awareness directly, and reinforces our \"sense of distance and differen tiation from everything else that exists\" (The Crystal Tablet of Set , page 6). WTW is the practice of sta nding up from a chair and perc eiving that you are pushing the universe down with your legs. Or sitting \" down\" is allowing the universe to move up, by relaxing the muscles in your legs. WTW is to never walk into a room. Instead, it is to pull the world under your feet, and then to pull the doorway around you, including the room itsel f. Walking the world transforms driving a car into rotating the car's wh eels to rotate the earth beneat h you. When you turn the steering wheel, you are actually pivoting the earth beneath you. Simply practicing being BTE prom otes the godlike perspective we desire here. I have noticed that awareness of those curtains called eyelid s which blink down with unconscious regularity, helps to remind me that I am behind those dark curtains looking out into the alien world. Also the concept that your body is a thoroughly mechanical robot (with mechanical programmed emotions and thoughts) which you can \"pilot\" from BTE is a useful aid to realizing this state. Language and the Whorfian Hypothesis One additional aid can be found in avoiding the us e of the verb \"to be\". By ceasing to say \"I am X\", and to substitute in its place \"I feel X\", or \"I ha ve X\", can produce a subtle but profound impact. Benjamin Lee Whorf was an American linguis t and anthropologist who studied Native American Indian languages, such as the Hopi, and suggested that the structure of language can determine the structure and kind of thinking available to the speaker of that language. The importance of this Whorfian Hypothesis is simply that if we learned to speak and think in a language which supported the deidentified experience of the Universe, we would immediately and automatically empower the Will. (I have discussed a candidate language, aUI, in The Scroll of Set , December XXI A.S.)"},{"pageNumber":812,"pageContent":"The Nature of the Self It is also important to recogni ze that your Identity, which is not anything you can experience including your mind, still requires a language-speaking mind in order to possess the quality of consciousness. To be cons cious is to be conscious of some experience. In The Book of Coming Forth by Night (XI, XII) we find: “I, Set, am my Self distinct from the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordered in and of my Self. HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and could achieve identity only by becoming what the Cosmic Order was not.” So, Set speaks here of \"becoming\" something ot her than that which can be experienced (the Universe). This is the process I have named Deidentification. Yet without a mind, to symbolize the concept of a \"Self beyond experience\", how could Set or any Being know about the Self. The Self is known indirectly through the naming or identification of the elements of experience wi thin the structure of language, the reasoning mind. Michael Aquino VI, in The Scroll of Set Volume XII, Number 5, page 14, stated, \"It is this ability to conceptualize somethi ng other than the natural universe that is, as I have said in BMTP , (2) the 'proof' of the existence of Set and of the cosmology of the Temple of Set.\" So in order for the Self to be conscious it requires a reasoning (sym bol-manipulating) mind. Yet for the Self to possess a nd exert a Will, the mind it uses must not be clouded by false identifications with elements of the natu ral universe, including the mind itself. (By the way, this precludes the possibility of a conscious God in the Judeo-Christian vein, because an infinite God would in clude within its identity field all possible minds. In view of the Deidentification Process, this would th erefore produce an impossible contradictory paradox concerning the identity and existence of God). Using the mind, we can examine the possibility th at the Self can be composed of more than one element. If the Self, through the mind, coul d ever identify any other element comprising Self, then, by the Deidentification Process, the Self would know that this was not Self. Therefore, the Self is One Self exterior to the Universe. Therefore, the Self which is really you, and the Self which is really me, and the Self which is really Set is the same One Self. Implications for Greater Black Magic In The Crystal Tablet of Set , page 32, we read, \"In G.B.M. the magician does not wish to present an artificial image at all, but rather to unveil his innermost Self.\" And Who is this \"innermost Self\"? Let us look to the invocation on page 36, \"... I am become One with the Eternal Set, whose Seat is behind the Constellation of the Thigh.\""},{"pageNumber":813,"pageContent":"The mention in the invocation of the historical referent star co nstellation makes clear that we are referring to Set by Name. Naming implies identification, and iden tification we now can recognize through the rigors of this paper, is a function of mind. Therefore, we see now that a Se lf with a particular mental pa ttern (a mind) which is named Set is sought for merging with in the execution of G.B.M.. The Mind of Set And what is the nature of the Mind of Set? First, Set is aware of the relationship between Self and mind to form conscious identity. Second, Set has memories of His past as a personality. Third, therefore, from at least a human pe rspective, the Mind of Set is immortal. The Priesthood of Set Again from The Crystal Tablet of Set , page 59, we read, \"... the merging of the consciousness, indeed the personality, with that of the Prince of Darkness himsel f. In this Working the Priest or Priestess in no sense loses personal identity or Selfawareness; rather one's consciousness is augmented, energized, and streng thened by that of Set.\" Also on that same page we see, \"Each Priest and Priestess of Set is a Temple of Set; a psyche so purified, educated, consecrat ed, and initiated, that it has become a fit medium for the Prince of Darkness.\" So we can understand that it is the mind of the Priest or Priestess which conforms to the structure of the Mind of Set. Again those elem ents include the product of the Deidentification Process, memories of a personality, and immortality. And how does the Priesthood achieve this reordering of the mind? Xeper Again, from The Book of Coming Forth by Night; Analysis and Commentary , page 26, \"Summarily the Word XEPER refers to the tr ansformation and evolution of the Will from a human to a divine state of being -- by delib erate, conscious, indivi dual force of mind.\" If the meaning of the word \"Will\" is the same as mine on page 7 of this paper, then the Deidentification Process is the XEPER process. If, instead, the meaning of the word \"Will\" refers to the structuring of the mind to parall el the qualities of the Mind of Set, then the Deidentification Process offers a conscious form ula for the XEPER, which, in turn, leads to virtually the same end. Summary and Conclusions The action of Deidentification results in the attainment of Will."},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"The definition of Will closely follows the \"effort\" mentioned on page 24 of The Book of Coming Forth by Night; Analysis and Commentary : \"Rather [Black Magic] is a deliberate and conscious effort to force the mind outward -- to impact upon and alter the 'laws' of the mechanical Universe. Hence it is an attempt to 'commit the same crime against God (=Universe)' as did the Set-entity, to place one's Self apart and distinct from the Universe. In another mode, Black Magic involves communica tion with the Set-entity as an independent being -- in deliberate violation of the 'laws' of the Universe.\" The attainment of Will is the act of XEPER. \"I [Set] entrust to you my essence, because thus we are the same.\" ( The Word of Set , the Fifth Part) \"Only through obliteration of the Universe that is may man seal his mastery of the Black Flame, for only thus may he know that he is not subject to a greater Will.\" ( The Diabolicon , The Statement of Leviathan) In my paper A Three-Dimensional Model of Possible Human Experience , I referred to the Ninth Pole of Consciousness as the Throne of Set. The Pole of Mastery is, I believe, the Gateway into the Universe for Set and the \"location\" of His Mind. By having the anchor of the Self safely located outside of the dream of time and space, the magician avoids the lost condition of a conf used psychotic, and continues to find meaning through the knowledge that there is an Eternal An chor which lies exterior to the Universe. The Magick of Awareness, then, is th at same \"power\" referred to in The Diabolicon , the Statement of Belial: \"I [Lucifer] give the e ssence of my own being, the Black Fire whose power alone can effect creation by force of Will.\" The Black Fire, then, symbolizes the true being outside of the Universe in that like fire it illuminates to make known that which is outside it, but is black in that, in itself, it cannot be perceived. Then, too, the Magick of Awareness must be th e first mode of Black Magic of the Priesthood of Set, as mentioned on page 24 of The Book of Coming Forth by Night; Analysis and Commentary : \"...a deliberate and conscious effort to force the mind outward -- to impact upon and alter the \"laws\" of the mechanical Universe.\" Finally, from The Book of the Law; Analysis and Commentary , page A5-9: \"(Will) is not of Nuit, and cannot be directly influenced by that Form.\" XEPER! Afterword Please understand that in this paper when I descri be Set as being the ninth Pole, I am referring to His Identity Essence. The Mind of Set is drawn from within the Universe while His Essence remains alien to the Universe as the Ninth Pole."},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"It may be a source of some interest that prior to my learning of the Temple of Set, I had been wearing a pentacle ring as a member of The C hurch of Satan. I decided to incorporate the following morning \"ritual\" as part of the training for my Personal Power Seminars: Place a facsimile of the five pointed star , surrounded by a circle, on your wall in your bedroom where you will see it fi rst thing in the morning. When you get up, touch each of the points of the star in turn. Firs t say while touching the first point , \"I am not what I see;\" then become aware, as a separate being, of all that you can see, mentally or physically. Touch the next point and state, \"I am not what I hear,\" and in the same fashion recognize that you are not what you can experience through any of your five senses, either mentally or physically. Then pause as you see the circle, wh ich represents all possible experience, and realize you are none of it. Then place your finger at the black heart of th e star, to acknowledge the Mystery which is what you truly are. In this way you put on your true personality each morning, in the same way you put on your clothing.

A nd then the strength that is mine shall be the strength of the Setian, and against the Will of Set no Creature of the Universe may stand.\" And in the commentary concerning this: \"The pentagram is here described as a geometric \"gate\" linking the mind of the Black Magician with that of Set upon the concentration of both.\" Footnotes 1.

This required my analysis of Set and His link with the human species. The question \"Who or what is Set\" is one that is familiar to all of us, I'm sure. In the first part of the Word of Set, we find the statement that Set fashioned our intelligence as his own. In the third part, we see that the essen ce of his being has been enshrined within us. In the fifth part, Set states, \"... and I entrust to you my essence, because thus we are the same.\" The ninth part states that our endurance depends on our essence, and the sixteenth part says, \"... You shall be as I who am the Overpowering One.\" Let me explain: In the first and third parts we can see that th e seed (potential) has been given to us and enshrined within us, but the labor of nourishing and strengthening this potential is ours. The fifth part would say that Set gives us the re sponsibility of his essence. By fulfilling our responsibility (nourishing the s eed), we are the same. The nint h part states that we are individuals by \"Your Essence\"; no two people will nourish their potential in the same manner or rate of becoming, and thus we are all indivi dual through our differen ces. To me, this means the Gift of Set is there to do with as we wish. Many (mos t) go through life ignoring its presence, yet only through the stre ngth of this Gift (essence) can we persevere over the Right Hand Path. By doing so, we begin to Become as the sixteenth part states, \"You shall be as I who am the Overpowering One,\" orde red in and of our own Self. In The Book of Coming Forth by Night , Set states, \"Let the one w ho aspires to my knowledge be called by the name Setian.\" Would Set, knowing that his knowledge is not attainable by the bearers of his Gift, give us th e Gift that allows us to be conscious of his knowledge and capable of being eagerly desirous of that knowledge? No, of cour se not! Therefore the knowledge of Set must be attainable. Can this be accomplished in our present form? In my opinion, yes. The possibility of having a higher understanding of the Knowledge of Set has been proven by great men such as Aleister Crowley, Anton LaVey, Michael Aquino, and James Lewis. Some people may be unable to fulfill their respon sibilities as a member of this higher degree, or may be unable to separate the Objective a nd Subjective Universes, t hus falling short of the demands such understanding requires. Anton La Vey's example is mentioned in the BoCFbN : \"To make man a Daemon, then, may be to break his self reference to the bounds in which his semblance must exist.\" The possibility of Becoming to the degree of Daemon or highe r is feasible, although while in the present human existence many are not yet capable of handling the respons ibilities of both existences (Objective and Subjective). At this time most are in the process of learning to develop our Essence which Set has placed with in us. The aforementioned people have been Recognized for their success in achieving the high er degrees of their times. Personally, I feel that there may be higher degrees to still be recognized. Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":817,"pageContent":"Those who may not attain such an understandin g of the Knowledge of Set in their present existence of human may still B ecome (Xeper). The High Priest once said we are capable of continuing after death if our Conscious Self is strong enough to transform. If we are continuing after death, wouldn't we continue to Xeper? So, if we continue to Xeper, then our Essence continues to have the abili ty to develop. This does not advocate suicide, because it would take the span of what we call a human lifetime to develop the Conscious Self enough to pass through Death. Another way of saying all of this is, \"The ma ximum potential of individual Xeper of one's Conscious Self is as great as Set's own Xeper potential, in that one can Come Into Being as one's own Self, ordered in and of one's own Self , just as Set is ordered in and of His Own Self.\" (Thanks to Adept Clayton Bozeman for this rewording of my statement.) * * * * * Some who read this article before publication posed questions I'd like to discuss here, since others may have similar questions. Would my statement, \"The maximum potential of the Subjective Mind is Equivalent to Set\" be limiting Set? No, for only if we feel our Subjective Mind is limited would we thereby limit Set. The only thing that tries to limit us is the Objective Self, and that is because of its human existence. In order to continue after death, our Subj ective Mind must be strong, and that strength depends at this time upon our Objective Mind as a medium of exercise. Because of this, the potential of the Subjective Mind / Conscious Self is underdeveloped at the present time. When this potential (essence) is exercised and nour ished, it can become more active and attain higher levels of existence. Continuing in life an d/or death we will Become equivalent to Set. Yet Set will also continue to Xeper. We woul d Come Into Being as our Own Self, ordered in and of our own Self, without limiting Set in any way. We would not be One with Set, as in the bli ssful existence of some well known religions, but on a plane parallel to that of Set. Assuming we are Gods within ourselves, then nothing can be higher than what we have the potential to B ecome. The possibilities of what the Subjective Mind can do and what Set is are limitless, but that is the Beauty of the Gift: we can learn as we experience and Become.

I am dressed in Black, signifying for me the area of knowledge I seek, which lies in Da rkness. The bell not only stands to honor the august Council of Nine, it brings my attention to bear on that which is in me and before me. As the tones vibrate into the air, it is as if my being resonates as well. There is the lighting of the Black Flame, that el usive light that beckons underneath the silver pentagram. I issue the invocation per the Crystal Tablet . My grail, that black chalice of Life, is now Filled (with spicy, hot V-8 juice). The choice of liquid is due to what I wish to keep in mind, that Truth, about Se lf or universe, is often molten to the taste. The elements are stirring, provocative, and you just may choke a little as it goes down. Truth is not always palata ble; it is simply Truth. Also, the liquid is red, symbolic to me of th e passion that burns in each of us. What the passion or passions are for is still to be discovered. The elements I call forth are as follows: - Due East I call up a female Wolf. - Due South I call up a Cobra Snake. - Due West I call up a Vampire. - Due North I call up a mighty Dragon. My elements consist of two creatures found in the \"physical\" world. They have powers attributed that are often despis ed yet admired, feared yet cove ted. My other two elements are \"mythical\" creatures. They also have attributes that are alternately yearned for by humanity, while being shrouded in stor ies of bloody destruction. My goal is to understand these beasts that ar e so much a part of human thought and feeling. These \"beasts\", both real and imagined, are in each one of us.

I managed to remove that \"block\" later that day, which resulted in a quick \"rejuvenation\" of my Self . In the evening I scribbled the \"Statement of Xem\" spontaneously.

Man has forgotten or destroyed all his accomplishments and developments of spirit. He continues to destroy and persecute everything that presents a threat to his petty egotism - everything th at is truly Good. He continues to kill his fellow men and the Life around him. As a result of this Working, I emerged with new insights on Man, and a new sense of beauty and importance of Initiation. To protect and enha nce Life is the sacred task.

Vernal Equinox Working, XV The dream after the Equinox III° Working: After the III° Working was over, I still felt in an altered state, and I felt that my communication with Set was not over. I tried to \"come back to this reality\" as it were, but couldn't. I felt tired and spent, and thought if I would get some sleep I would awaken recharged and \"normal.\" As soon as I fell asleep, my dreams began. I realized what I was seeing in my dream were symbols, some were in fact true or accurate symbols, some were ways and methods of helping me understand and remember what was necessary. The very first thing that came to me was the real ization that before I could do anything, I would have to Understand what the Order of Set was truly about. I understood that the calling of the Forms - Macrocosmic and Microcosmic was in fact imprecise. Rather, that Macro force was a personification in this di mension of the Agele ss Intelligence, unbound by time, regardless of its bearer in this dimensi on. This timeless principle I saw as a blue-white type of laser beam, passing through and cutti ng through darkness, light, whirling masses - all dimensions. It appeared as a bl ue-white energy, but it in fact was a composite. I sensed that it wasn't in reality composed of many hues, red, gold and such, but rather that this was done for me to understand it was in fact a composite. This composite I knew was Set, the Ageless Intelligence, pure Spirit, unbound by Time and Space, yet unable to manifest in physical form on this plane. The Microcosmic I saw more clearly defined as a three-dimensional function realized by those Magicians in this dimension, realizing to the fullest their func tion of one of those aspects of the Set composite; and reaching up as it were from the physi cal plane and touching Classification: V2 - B6M.19 - 1 (U5) Author: Ricco A.

They were able this way to give life to it in this dimension, so ind eed the Old Ones could come through. I saw a symbol then of the Pentagram with its five points (only after co mprehending first what this \"Order\" of Set was), indica ting five phases that would be. I understood this to be only as an aid to help me remember the five important steps: 1.That I (or any being that would want to help in this transm utation) would first have to understand the reason for and the workings of the Order of Set, i.e., th e Macro to the Micro. 2.The second step would be higher man rais ing himself through self -initiation and self- purification. For unless there is understanding of the principles of the Order of Set and unless the Tool itself (our Being) be purified, the next three steps could not continue. 3.The third step would be the in dividual Magician manifesting his/her individual Micro-neter, i.e., Anubis manifesting himself, and my ma nifesting Thoth to the fullest, where (for example) the \"micro-Thoth\" might start to me rge with (manifest, make real!) the \"macro- Thoth\". 4.Once this was done, I understood that the Grea ter and Lesser Companies of the gods, the pantheon of the gods and Set and the Elect, woul d have to teach each within the Order the workings of their individual micro-macro functions, and touch on the other magicians' matching micro-macro functions within themselves. 5.Once each of us would have manifested our ow n micro/macro-neter and developed it to the fullest, then with help from the Order in turn develop all other aspects of Set within us, I understood we would then create a doorway for Set to enter, for we would each in turn BE Set manifest in this dimension. The Great Work w ould then be accomplished. All that we would have known as \"laws\" would pass; Heaven woul d pass; Hell would pass - that passage from the Diabolicon . I further understood that if any magician neglected for long the utilization and manifestation of their Neter, the honor would pass to another. In conclusion, I understood one of the prime f actors in raising our consciousness to bring about this Great Work would be the use of th e power called the Kundalini Force - or through the Serpent One. Through the refining and defini ng of this Force would we be able to raise our own Will, of this Magical Child, up the spinal column or chakras and give it mobility. I saw the Serpent as a red, amber-like, hot fier y coil spiraling around the chakras up the spinal column. As it rises the same cold blue-white type of energy surrounds the spine like a tube, encompassing the Serpent as it rises. heat within cold, as it were, or ra ther, heat within cold electrical energy.

V. From 10.16 XV Working Understanding of the Five Gates and Their Function The First Gate is located in the region between the pectoral or breast. It is the center of the Heart, symbolized by the one calle d Thoth. Its symbol is visualiz ed as a silvery white moon. It is the Thesis. It is the Gate at which the be ing begins to understand how to transcend Subject- object relationships, and see this world in its (Truth) Reality. Th e only truth is in Being. This by no means implies that the Magician has made it. It is only a beginni ng, and as such we will have occasional \"lapses\", and fall back to the lower planes momentarily. The Second Gate is located in th e center area in line with the collar bone - at the base of the Throat. It is the passageway into the outer realms of the Temple, and is symbolized by a crystal gate or door, silh ouetted by Anubis at its entrance, both to guide the Initiate in, or to block. It is the magical Antithesis. At th is level the being not only understands but knows how to fully apply the illuminated consciousness, knowing full well that whatever energy it puts out to others will bounce back, as it were, tenfol d. Control of the Awakened state at this level is almost constant and without regressi on (or for a short span of tim e, if at all) to a lower plane. The Third Gate is symbolized by the Serpent risi ng in the area called the \"third eye\" and for the first time piercing through a pa rt of the anatomy. The being at this level observes all in a heightened, altered, awakened state uninterrupted from a metacenter. This is the magical synthesis. Being becomes merged with Nete r, and the new being observes itself almost \"outside\" of itself. The raising of the magician's consciousness, along with the power that the Serpent Power within is wielding, added to the synthesis whic h is the product of Being merging with the Neter, now brings about an abnormal surge of Powe r. This acts as a cata lyst which allows the being to raise the Hood and expand it fuller and fu ller, while instructed by Anubis as to what centers to touch on in the Brain to bring about chemical, AlXemical changes.

Am-Ut/Ammit: Names of Power Introduction While an Adept during the Winter of the year XV A.S., I began an exploration into the Concepts of Magickal names and Neters. Such re search provided a valuable tool with which I systematized the Elements of my own Greater Bl ack Magickal Universe into what I felt was a cohesive system of correspondences. The following extracts are revisions of papers from that ongoing Work. The culmination of these researches has led me to several personally significant lines of thought. Am-Ut It was not long after I had become a member of the Temple of Set, in December of XIV A.S., that I came to realize that within mySelf there existed a strong affinity with the Anubian Neter and the related ideas, Forms, and symbolisms wh ich are attributed to that ancient Egyptian God. At first these feelings were intuitiona l, and I attributed them to the objective ramifications created by my being - at that tim e - in the funeral business. So, in accordance with this objective perspec tive of Anubis, I felt that it would be in my own best interests to let the oncoming succession of events pass, and not actively engage in the development of those particular ideas. I knew that if the Anubian Form was indeed an act ive catalyst to the development of my own Being that I would, upon gaining a wider informational base, find Classification: V2 - B6N - 1 Author: Roger L. Whitaker III° Date:   Winter,   XV   Revision: April 12, XXII Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"that this would become blatan tly obvious to me. There was to be no pushing nor grasping for the miraculous. In a nutshell, I had decided not to press th e Coming into Being of my Magickal name. I wanted the process of Initiation to objectively, Magick ally, and philosophica lly show that the Form was indeed correct for me in its Essence. I wanted to be sure that my Magickal name was what my Being demanded from me in order to Xeper, rather than something I wanted on a personality level. For the next few months I went about obtaining books, reading, and Working with the Tarot. Most of all I began to learn how to shuffl e my mundane life around Magick, rather than shuffling Magick around to fit in with my mundane schedule. As time passed I doubled my efforts, and then doubled them again. I demanded that Magick become not a mere intellectual extravagance, but rather that Magick must be the center of my existence... all else must revolve around Magick. I really knew that to come to any de pth of Understanding of the intricacies involved, I would have to live within that realm. Time passes, and Magister Lynn Norton asks me to write of my Understanding of the First Degree. I do so, and shortly th ereafter I am recognized as Adep t within the Temple. It was upon the same day of my Second Degree recognition that I finally speak of my collectively stronger feelings regarding A nubis to Magister Norton. Taking Budge's Gods of the Egyptians from a nearby bookshelf, Magister Norton hands it to me. Thumbing through it, my eyes caught the name of Am-Ut. A wave of intuit ion sweeps over me; I suddenly feel shaky and disoriented. Am-Ut is Anubis in his Form as an embalmer of the dead. He is ca lled the \"Dweller within the room of Embalment.\" This is all the information I could find on Am-Ut. So I took what I had and actively went to Work with it. Am-Ut had Come into Being. From this point on I shall be speaking for the most part symbolically. This is necessary due to the subject matter at hand. There is no other wa y I may accurately convey my feelings to you in a format even close to mutual Understa nding, except through the symbolic. It is the Magickal language. Am-Ut is a \"Dweller\" by name. He exists within a particular Ideal, and does not manifest the reactive Principles associated with the same. Th e Ideal I speak of is the realm in which Am-Ut exists ... the Embalming room. The Embalming Prin ciple is one in which the dead corpse is prepared for the new life which awaits after corporeal death. Since I am involved with a religion of the living, my associ ations with this em balming Principle are philosophic and not quite as objective as what I just related. I see de ath as the stasis of th e living Being. More so, I see death as the attempt of the living to consciou sly become a part of the mechanical Order of the Universe (God). By this perspective I saw al l theist religions as \"D eath\" religions in the truest sense of the term. Taking the particular outlook I have regardi ng the embalming room, the embalming function, and death, Am-Ut began to take on a role whic h is most important. Am-Ut is a Principle which can activate or prepare the dead being (sta tic, mechanical existence) for a new life (the path of Initiation - to Xeper). I see Am-Ut as being associated with an inherent potentiality that has not been activated to a point of manifestation. Am -Ut is a non-reactive Principle"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"within the concepts previous ly mentioned. Potential is al ways non-reactive unless first consciously realized as to its existence, and then manifested in the form of active Work. Am-Ut had been a mirror image of my own Be ing in a non-realized state. Through Am-Ut I could see what I may Become. I had realized, and I mean realized to a depth that words cannot adequately express, th e importance of the Initiatory journey. With this knowledge came a barrage of realizations regarding my own Self. As an afterthought I recalled how I had for years referred to myself in personal circle s as a \"Dweller,\" a \"Lurker on the Threshold,\" and so on. I now knew that although I had alwa ys had the potential to become an active participant within any of the several occult gr oups I had been associated with, I had never taken the impetus to do so. I was always satisf ied with simply \"Dwelling\" within that group, and really doing nothing else. A serious diletta nte would be an adequa te description. I was saddened by the reality, but I also knew these realizations were necessary if I Truly wanted to Xeper. It now came to me that Am-Ut had fulfilled its inherent function. The blood was running through me; I had come from the dead to live once again. Am-Ut's time had now passed, and I no longer felt comfortable using that as a Magickal name. A necessary, but passing experience had been realized. As previously I did not press mySelf to find a ne w Magickal name. I knew, just as before, that this must occur at its own time, and at the ri ght stage of my Xepering process. Invigorated by these conceptualizations, I worked with rene wed intensity and allowed the succession of events to move on. Ammit Through Am-Ut I had come upon a methodology in which I had discerned important realizations pertaining to mySe lf. One of which I consider very important is that I now realized within my heart that significant changes were taking place within me. Through my own efforts and the Magickal help of Am-Ut, a Creation was Coming into Being. Now, as far as I can discern, this Creation very much i nvolves the making of a vehicle within mySelf which will allow me to comprehend those recondite abstractions which are inherent within the symbolic language and its related teachings. B ecause of this my obj ective perspective had begun alteration. Rather than simply take in s timuli and react to it, I began to carefully consider objective reality as an infinite variety of Forms, id eas, and Principles. Taking in objective stimulus in this manner allowed me to no longer blunder from one reaction to another. I now had the ratiocination which woul d let me Create the desired stimulus, which would in turn invoke a proper reaction that w ould be conducive to In itiatory growth. I now began to take control of my own evolution vi a a method which allowed me to work and view the objective world around me in a ma nner which promulgated Initiation. I feel certain that what I am relating is neither new, nor intensely profound. However, I am at a loss of words to describe its importance to actu ally, Truly, realize all of this within my heart and soul. I now had a method of Magickal Work which did not require th e use of ritual to invoke. I now had the perspective necessary to view my surroundings in a Magickally reactive manner that required no prodding. Am-Ut was the Principle of potentiality realized into consciousness. However at the moment of manifestation into consciousness Am-Ut had ceased to exist as the poten tial and had now become an Ac tive Principle. Ammit had now Come into Being."},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"Ammit is called a primal Neter whose Function is that of absorption. The idea of something that is primal brings up the analogy of the seed which has not yet manifested that which lies locked within its own genetics. Th e seed simply exists in a sta tic state of non-evolution, which can only be broken by a series of external events that are necessa ry for the seed's growth. The function of absorption now becomes very intere sting. Consider the seed as the unmanifest potential to Xeper. Also let us consider the nutr ients which are necessary for this seed to grow as knowledge and Understanding. The seed must absorb within itself those nutrients which that particular seed needs to progress beyond the unmanifest primal stage of Initiatory development. Upon absorbing the knowledge that is inherent and linked to that strain of seed, and giving a due amount of time for gestati on and growth, life begins. Any number of external factors (inertia l outbursts) may effect, and even in terfere with this seed's growth. However, with the proper maintenance and care we can expect growth an d a realization of full potential. I relate this to the Pyramid Functi on of the Temple (the Pyramid Function is now defunct, however a form of it has been revived in the Gates of Hell Pylon). To be of note is that this pa rticular seed exists within an intelligent host who may, under the correct circumstances, realize that it does exist. If this becomes the case the intelligent host can create the proper environment that will allow the manifestation of the inherent potentiality to Come into Being. We are the Great Creators! By Am-Ut the seed was recognized on a truly em otional and eventually rational scale. This being the case, I went about creating the \"nutritional\" atmosphere of knowledge and Understanding that were required for growth. As the moment of growth began, the host realized that changes were indeed occurring. Comprehension had now begun to manifest. Ammit is pictured as a monster that is a composite of three animals. These animals are the Lion, the Hippo, and the crocodile. Those aspe cts which comprised Ammit have been historically considered the fier y aspects ... the destruc tive aspects of the creatures. Please keep in mind that the fire that destroys may al so purify, and will often do both. In accord with Ammit's function of absorption, she has been hist orically called the \"D evourer of the Heart\" and the \"Eater of the Dead.\" C onsidering the heart as the seat of life, the progenitor of both good and evil, and also the root of ones own conscience, Ammit becomes the comprehension of one's own Self with which the process of purification may take pl ace. To accept the Great Work one must change their perceptual out look in a manner which allows the Setian Understanding of objective reality. This new pe rceptual outlook allows the individual to create an atmosphere conducive to Initiation. This process of taking in objective stimulus cannot be accomplished without the realization that there exists a potentiality to be more than part of the mundane masses. The fruition of the seed is now manifest in certain Understandi ngs pertaining to the consciousness of humanity and with an Unde rstanding of one's own Being. The realization now is that for the seed to reach maturity one must enter a new World, a world where only a special type of seed may manifest fully. This is a world where perspectives constantly change and shift, they float freely in an atmosphere of separation from the objective Universe. It is here that there is also madness and fear. To see now beyond the fear requires balance, and upon accomplishing this one can begin an embryonic c onceptualization as to the nature of the Great Work of Initiation. The objective form of the monster Ammit is a vi sual representation of the fear I have just spoken of. Ammit struck terror a nd fear into the heart of the ancient Egyptian, for if their"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"heart was light when weighed it was the fire that issued forth from Ammit's mouth that would consume, and destroy them. Most would allow their intellectual f ear of this monster stop them at the level of Understanding wh ere they confronted this fear. They could not look beyond the terrifying appearance of this m onster whose visual form they felt was creating the fear in their soul. Ammit is a grotesque monster made of th ree naturally occurring animal species who, in their combination, is an extremely unnatural expression of those creatures' destructive qualities. To an individual whose state of Bei ng exists as a component of the Natural Order, Ammit is a visual representation that says what lies beyond the fear of the heart is the unnatural within the contorted gu ise of the natural. Only th e Truly inspired will look beyond the appearance and seek the Essence that lies with in. Truth is often not very pretty, and often strikes a reaction of fear within one's Self. It is Truth - Maat - that feeds the fire with which Ammit destroys, and if armed with Understandin g, purifies with. So, just as Ammit represents the function of absorption, at th at same moment there comes into existence its dialectic function of elimination. The Root of the Element of Fire I have, over these past few months, developed a manner of using my Work with the Tarot in a way that has led me to a greater Understandi ng of mySelf and the Setian philosophy. I do not use a random laying out of the cards. Over the last year I have been taking out a single card from the deck and studying it. I have repeated th is process over and over with all of the cards. As a result of this, my Magickal Work will invok e an image of a particul ar card; this is very intense and obsessive. When this occurs I remove that card fr om the deck and explore it in conjunction with my particular Magickal study. Most often a series of three to five cards will manifest. During the time I have been with the Temple of Set, I have used two different Magickal names. During the period I was working with Am -Ut, the Tarot card the Ace of Wands forced its presence most vividly, and in such a ma nner that I was forced to fully explore it in relationship to Am-Ut. In the center of the card is an outburst of flam e in the shape of the tr ee of life. Contained within this fire of existence is all that is ... the beginning a nd the end, thesis and antithesis. Each flame of this tree of life is in the shape of the Hebrew letter Yod. Let me make it clear that I am not a Kabbalist. But, because of th e Kabbalistic symbolisms inherent within the card, I had to explore these par ticular relationships. I found out that the letter Yod is the foundation for all the other letters of the Hebr ew alphabet. It is th e underlying relationship which brings, upon personal study, a c ohesiveness and relationship to the concepts of the tree of life. It is therefore the firs t and hidden impulse. All else ar e various elemental combinations of this first form manifestation. Yod is also call ed the \"Secret fire\" (the Black Flame?). It is from this original outburst of energy that ma nifestation begins, but there is no control, for bolts of lightning burst in all directions with no controlling force. The energy is manifest, but seed has not been realized. The Ace of Wands is called the \"e ssence of the element of fire in its inception.\" It is pure potential, not yet manifesting itself as a part of the conscious \"Will.\" \"It is the primordial energy of the Divine, manifesti ng itself into matter at so ea rly a stage that it has not yet definitely formulated as Will\" (Book of Thoth ). There is now knowledge of the seed of potentiality, but it is not yet at a stage of development where ther e is a systematization of the"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"Elements involved that will allow the primal seed to grow. All of this I relate to Am-Ut and my experiences with that name. I think that it is interesting to note that the rest of the small cards of the fire element which come after the Ace of Wands are a progressive degeneration of that element. The Ace is the seed of the element, and the rest of the cards in their succession show that upon the knowledge of realizing the potential is there, th ere follows a rapid intellectual degeneration of the first form from which th e potential is manifest. Quickl y the original knowledge is complicated to a point where different avenue s of expression are sought, and simplicity takes over again. This is part of conscious comprehe nsion. The process of creation begins with one of destruction. Once again the fire that destroys can also purify. Upon the comprehension of mySelf the seed of potentiality became reactive to my self induced stimuli, and I took the necessary steps to manipulate my environment in the direction most suitable for my own Initiation. It has be en a difficult process of blundering about, wondering how all of my own Work could fit in with the other Sorcerers that I had come to know. Another card that I worked with during this period was the Knight of Wands. Looking at the card one sees the Knight on Horseback; in hi s hand he holds the outbu rst of the Yod flame seen previously in the Ace. In this card there is now direction and contro l. All the energies are going forward with a fiery intensity. The horse upon which the Knight rides leaps forward not to be held back! Upon the Suit of Armour that the Knight is wearing there is a small dragon upon his heart. Leviat han manifested. The seed of the Ace has now undergone its in evitable degeneration and has direction and control due to the destruction and purification of the host's heart. There is order and a \"Will\" to the direction that the seed will manifest. Bu t a warning is implicit to one whose Great Work follows this fiery path. \"If he fails in his first effort, he has no resource\" (Book of Thoth ). Is this a warning to all of the Elect? I believe th at Ammit partakes within various other first Forms and Principles relating to other Neters, and their names of power for the functions of absorption and elimination are absolutely necessar y. T his brings me to the next card I worked with during this period of time, the Ten of Disks. This card repr esents wealth. Let us consider wealth in the form of knowledge. You can only absorb so much, and then a manifestation of that knowledge will occur. There is a saturation capacity within the Initiatory complex that will either manifest or dissipate. Wealth is no t wealth if it is merely accumulated and never touched upon. The Ten of Disks is a final issue of energy, it is a card of regeneration. It is the final card before the Trumps. It is the accomplishment of th at which will lead you into the world of the Atu (Trumps) or back into the cycle of complexity. The final card I worked with was Atu V, the Hi erophant. The presence of this card has been intimidating. A short time ago I found out that this card was being redesigned in the Setian Tarot; its new title will be The Priest of Set.

Pridgen II° Date: April 8, XXV (1) June 12, XXV (2) Revision: August 21, XXV HTML Revision: Dec 16, 1998 CE Subject:  Tuat  Reading List: "},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"On the night of April 8, XXV A.S., I established ra pport with a Neter, i.e.: a facet or aspect of the Prince of Darkness. The method of dialectic used for the performance of this Working is best described as a synthesis of right and le ft brain thinking and conceptualization. This demonstrates the essence of my reciprocal magical formula LA-QIN-AL and of Magus Flowers' \"Polarian Method.\" The Tuat Working was an illustrative Working of GBM. The purpose of this Working was an attempt at noetic apprehension of the principl e expressed by the name Tuat. As Sir E. A. Wallis Budge informs us: The meaning of the name Tuat is unknown, and it is useless to specu late upon it or invent etymologies for it: it was applied to the home of the beautified spirits and the damned, no doubt in predynastic times, and the exact meani ng it conveyed to the minds of those who first used it has been lost. In the Book of Coming Forth by Night , the meaning of the name Tuat is transcribed as the Place of Destruction. During the Tuat Working, I received the impression that the principle expressed by the name Tuat is realized and actu alized through the persons of the Elect in their capacity as \"those who Work by the Spiral Forc e.\" The result of this was a comprehension that the principle expressed by the name Tuat is of a dual nature. For profane humanity, the Tuat is a Place of Destruction. For the Elect, the Tuat is a pla ce of transformation in which to purify the lower self in order to bring forth th e Remanifestation of the Higher Self, a place of Xeper. This does not mean that, due to some petty whim of the Prince of Darkness, those people he doesn't like will be dissolved into the non-c onscious embrace of the objective universe the moment they give up the ghost. It simply mean s that only the Elect, and none other, are capable of and persistent in ac quiring the skills th at would enable them to manipulate the Spiral Force, and thereby confer upon themselves the ability to overcom e the fragmentation of consciousness at the moment of death. The essence of my Quest is an intrinsic part of the following questions. What is the Spiral Force? What are the methods the Elect are able to use in order to manipulate it? The Spiral Force is no less than the life force or animating essence. It is a nonnatura l force, and its proper manipulation confers the ability to eternally Xeper and Remanifest. Ilya Prigogine's work with dissipative structures and the \"laws\" of thermodynamics are highly relevant to these investigations. His work shows that the i norganic (objective) uni verse is plummeting headlong into heat death due to entropy (lack of coherence), while organic life is moving toward more and more complex (less stable) st ates of coherence (neg entropy/information). My theory is that the Black Flame (non-local tho ught field) is present on ly in Self-conscious life, while the Red Flame (morphi c field) applies to the entire non-natural phenomenon of life, the entire logarithmic spiral. During this Working, I transcribed the inspired utterance printed on page one. The following is an attempt to expound this transcription in an unambiguous and straightforward manner. I Sokaris am the Elder Horus realized in full dignity! On the surface this exclamation appears absur d, for Initiates of the Temple of Set know HarWer to be the Elder Horus. The only (a nd inconclusive) connection between the two"},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"Neters is that they are both hawk-headed. Here I face the problem that Dr. Aquino points toward in his statement: Since a given god could be portrayed in a num ber of different ways, identifying the \"core god\" is difficult. I suspect this is due to the fine art of anthropomorphism, i.e.: the inflicting of human characteristics upon unsuspecting gods, daemons , and animals. The work of the eminent Egyptologist Abd el Hamid Zayed has provided us with the following clue. In his 1968 (III A.S.) archaeological analysis of the Stélé of Revealing, (3) he informs us that: a very interesting point about th ese stelae is the eviden ce they afford for the religious views of the period. Most noteworthy is the identification of forms of Ra-Horakhty with Soker-Osiris. And as Dr. Aquino points out: Summarily the Stélé of Revealing is not based on the Osirian triad at all; its themes are those of a Theban Sun-cult based upon Horus the Elder and Ra-Harakte. Magister Menschel postulates that HarWer is mankind. In my mind, his analysis and study reasonably affirm this basic premise. Reconsider ing the above exclamatio n in this context, it seems to indicate that the transcription is a monologue between my lower self and my Higher Self. The principle of Xeper id entifies and reconciles these polarities, while Remanifestation actualizes the process as a recurring phenomenon. Because it is the Will of Set that a Setian Remanifest his/her Higher Self, his presence can be said to be implied rather than directly experienced. This transcript is thus analogous to a mirror image of the Will of Set (see Plato's Allegory of the Cave). Sokaris is the Egyptian Lord of D eath, \"the hidden one,\" or \"he w ho is shut in\" -- Osiris as the Black Sun enclosed in the earth's womb, at th e bottom of the underworld, in a secret pyramid filled with \"blackest darkness.\" Sokaris was a title of the phallus at the point of \"dying,\" sending forth seed into the dark. The Arabic word for \"penis,\" zekkar , came from the god's name. The same Lord of Death was a tutelary deity of the necropolis at Saqqara, another variation of his name. He also appeared in Babylon as Zaqar , a messenger from the moon -- that is, from the land of death. In Hebraic he was zakar , \"maleness, virility.\" His medieval descendant was the phallic Satan enclosed in the darkest central pit of Hell, yet radiati ng the spirit of lust. In Peter Tompkins' Secrets of the Great Pyramid , Sokaris is identified as the omphalos or central point on the surface of the earth. This juncture or sandhi is marked by a hemispheroidal stone. The central omphalos is sa id to be in the Temple of Amon at Thebes. There is also an omphalos in the necropolis of Saqqara west of Thebes. These are earthly power zones in the form of a locus through which the Powers of Darkness manifest. It is interesting to note the similarity betw een this concept and SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler's Mittelpunkt der Welt located in the Hall of the Dead (Walhalla) at Wewelsburg Castle in Westphalia. This concept also runs parallel to Aleister Crowley's conception of Hadit (Behdet) as a locus or concentration of consciousness in the center of the infinite void of Nuit or Night (Greek NQX ). This relationship can be illust rated numerically by the fact that"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"both Hadit and Sokaris have the value by gematr ia of 421. The Stellar re presentation of this locus is the Pole Star, which changes ever y 2160 years due to th e precession of the Equinoxes. The Elect of Set receive the nouris hment that the Black Flame provides via the concentration of such a locus. Those who are in the Tuat are th e Lords of the Spiral Force. It is interesting to note that th e uas sceptre is \"distinguished by a spiral shaft and the absence of a decorative base.\" Those who are in the Tu at are those who wield the power typified by the uas sceptre, hence \"Lords of the Spiral Force.\" The awakening of the Gods is at hand and the Goddess shall bring forth one who is undefiled in the old ways. \"The awakening of the Gods\" refers to the Elect achieving metamind abilities, what P. D. Ouspensky terms the awake state. I read th e term \"awakening\" as being synonymous to becoming Self aware. Becoming Self aware is ou r task, the Work at hand. I interpret \"the Goddess\" as being Bast. Bast is the Cat G oddess, the Goddess of Pleasure. The cat is symbolic of independence. Independence must be gained before becoming Self aware is rendered possible. This independence of Will is perturbing to the Cosmic Inertia, but quite pleasurable to the Elect. I also read into this the meaning that we shoul d consider our Work as something pleasurable, something to be Indulged in. This constitutes the emotional use of the intellect, a characteristic of Satan or Set/HarWer fused. The reasons for our actions should be regulated by our True Will (Greek Thelema ). This implies, of course, profound Self knowledge. Y ou must know what your True Will is, before freedom of choice, and Indulgence, are realized as possibilities. It stands to reason that one who has attained to such an ex alted state of Self awareness would choose to Indulge in the high and the lofty, rather than in the base a nd the degenerate. Xeper, the conscious, Willful evolution from a human to a divine state of be ing, is such an act worthy of Indulgence. Georg W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) knew the above axio ms to be Truths, as demonstrated by the following quote: Only that will which obeys law is free; for it obeys itself -- it is inde pendent and so free. I concluded the Working with a Tarot reading using Crowley's O.T.O. Thoth deck. The layout of the cards was in a straight line, being symbolic of a pr ogression through the Tuat. This reading was kindly analyzed by Magister Menschel: The first card, 9-W , is a good representation of your current state of being. Strong, filled with the Strength of Thelema (Will, symbolized by th e Wands and their Fire); you must use this strength, apply it to your Xeper, or fall into the trap of the 10-W. Assuming you pass this Initiation and successfully turn the Fire of Thelema Inward, your future is symbolized by the Knight of Wands , The Active and Accomplished Will. I have full confidence that you will follow your Xeper at least this far -- it is the unnatural conclusion of the Path you now follow."},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"But from that Accomplishment, where do you go? To rest on those laurels will be stagnation, a stagnation which is Hell to the Setian Will. (We are, after all, ta lking about the Place of Destruction -- and what Destruct ion could be more painful th an the accomplishment of our goals, and the inability to do anyt hing meaningful afterwards?) If there can be opposites in the four suits, th en Wands and Disks are those opposites, the most active and the most passive. Likewise, among th e court cards the Knight and Princess are opposites, again the most active and the most passive, the most accomplished to the least accomplished. You yourself pointed out the masc uline / feminine opposites involved here. I read this to mean that your Xeper will demand a complete change in direction, study, personality, or some aspect of your being whic h is central to it. Y our study of LA-QIN-AL should enable you to understand what I'm talking about. If I were to point to a parallel in my own history, it would be that I had worked for several years with the Neter Shu, and had adopted that Name and begun to assume the Being of Shu. Part of becoming a Magister Templi for me involved maintaining Shu while also assuming the Being of Tefnut. Your future Xeper will al so include a similar inco rporation of Opposite. Such Opposition is dangerous, and success is not assured. Failure can bring forth the worst of the Tuat. But success brings forth 9-D , perfectly balancing the 9-W. Having accomplished Balance, where next? Atu XV has several different possible interpretations, none of which yells out as be ing more correct than the others. I like the interpretation whereby the In itiate (you) Becomes godlike in Being, Becomes Set-like. Equally likely is the interpreta tion in which this card simply points to a strong relationship between you and the Prince of Darkness, pe rhaps Priesthood, perhaps something else. Footnotes 1.

This Knum I've Become Though it is difficult to explain both the Knum and Uriaz within me w ithout going into a long and detailed \"epic\", I shall attempt nevertheless to cut the dramatics of which I am guilty all to often! Knum was a god of creation, a ram-headed god of th e first cataract of th e Nile on the Island of Elephantine. He was said to be the maker of earth, water, and the unde rworld, and creator of gods and men from clay on a potter's wheel. K num represented earth and divinity, and was self-created. Let me explain this duality within me as I see it and feel it. First of all, Knum is a very real existence to me, and even though \"Old Khem\" ex ists no more, the Ka (spirit) of Knum has adopted this human \"I-am\". You may ask, in the face of my apparent absolutism, \"How do you know that within you is this Knum? Maybe it's indigestion or left-over a nxiety!\" My answer to this seems to vary, as Xeper is never predictable or easily explainable. Classification: V2 - B6N.17 - 1 Author: Paul S.

Knum has many of the qualities that my human se lf has, and I am always kept on my toes by the concept of Xeper and by Xepering within myself. I accepted the adoption of Knum as a challenge and experiment, and it has been both sorrowful and beautiful. I've so much love and strength with th is duality, for our Aeon and the Dark Prince, that often, because of my exciteme nt to create, I end up f eeling like I've got one million fragmented possibilities and only one place to put them! This, if you know the feeling, is rather like having a full bladder with no place to go! It is at this point that the gui dance of the \"Ka\" of Knum points out a direction, and if I am not in a resisting mood, I take the \"info\" and put it into immediate action. The relationship of Knum and Uriaz is a strange and beautiful thing, and isn't easy to explain; but for me it is ever so real and exciting. Knum is but a memory of a forgotten past, but as the human Uriaz fades into timelessness, the \"might y\" horned one speaks and again shares a sight of what was and what is to come.

Guland, I was told by the Book of Ceremonial Magic , was a demon of storms and one not known as the most malevolent, and so it seemed at the time, one safe enough for the beginning magician to call upon, and so prepare for Guland's coming I did. Naturally enough, Mr. Guland apparently either had business elsewhere at the time, or declined the invitation altogether and did not appear, contrary to A. E. Waite's written assurances. After doing a ritual dismissal, just in case Guland might be trying to get a budding magician to fling straight into Hell's flames, and then waiting for a while to make sure no smell of sulfur escaped from any direction, I revi ewed my entire plan from start to finish. If A. E. Waite knew what he was talking about, Guland and I should have been on a friendly basis by then. Of course, we were not. In fact, we were not on any sort of basis. If all the rules had been followed to the la st letter, why no results? There were two main possibilities: some vita l component was missing, or Waite was talking through his hat. A pity almost that the answer was the latter -- Guland sounded like a perfectly charming being to pal around with on stormy ni ghts. And so Guland was filed away \"No Go\" and there he remained, gathering dust and popping up only at brief and infrequent periods to bring about \"Oh god, did I really do that?\" responses. After all, it didn't really dawn on me at the time that had the demon appeared, he coul d have easily gone above or below the magical circle and grabbed a clawful of tender young magi cian for his pleasure. But what the mind of man can conceive, it can also dissect and some times create. In the case of demons and gods one usually finds someone else in another tim e and place has beaten everyone else to the particular goal in mind. Had this been done with Guland? In his aspect as a stormbringer, yes. A number of deities, from Set himself on, have been known as ha ving power over storms and the concept is therefore not a new one. Ther e is no telling where the ge ntleman Magus Crowley once characterized as \"dead Waite\" plucked the name and descriptions and beyond that, the matter is purely academic. Of more importance is the fact that even if Guland was only a small part of a greater money making scheme on the part of Waite, that demon can be utilized successfully. All it takes is a bit of mental imagery and determination and voila , a homemade demon of no uncertain powers. I offer the following inner-chamber ritu al to assist this coming into being.

I maintained my concentration; gradually the vision became consistent, enabling me to understand aspects of it. First there came an impression of the concentration and extension of Will. This seemed only to provoke random, distracting thought-forms which were exorcised with effort. There followed a sensation of false serenity: a trap, at which it would have been futile to linger. This trap was composed of \"pointless emotions,\" yet their very unificati on and direction by my Will had given them purpose. Then came a series of abstractions, complete with wild, brilliant colors: seemingly chaotic geometries, unorganized and fleeting images of which I was the center. At this point I was most susceptible to confusion or fascinat ion because of the visions. Nevertheless I instinctively knew that this was the most impor tant development in my own magical Work so far. Previously I had only rarely attained this level, and had been able to transcend it only by accident. Now I became aware of a sort of pressure so mewhere around the crown of my skull which \"felt\" like a block or closed door . Instinctively I knew what to do: I relaxed and directed the force of my Will towards this area. Mentally I \"explained\" to the pressure who I was and what I was doing, and then I became as one with it. I felt the pressure subsiding, releasing a flood of simultaneous emotions which nearly overw helmed me. There was vibrant joy; then understanding, tears, and sadness mo st profound; then joy again; th en a feeling that I was not alone, even inside my Self. Finally there were impressions relevant to my Working question. \"Children of the night\" came to me again, followed by the vision of a coffin. Therein I saw th at the legends of vampires were derived from a forgotten reality. Beings there were who functioned strictly at night through choice, not necessity. These bein gs were magicians (not bloodsuckers), and they came forth at night for protection and priv acy from the dark-fearing humans; by day they slept, hidden away. They had the power to exer cise a strong magical c ontrol over the humans who slept by night. Then I saw the Elect of t oday assuming the places of those magicians, and creating a magical grid of control over the worl d. We lived by day and Worked, and we were in constant communication with Set.

I brought with my heredity knowledge and crafts of all the sciences. I gave to Khem my stepped pyramid for which Zozier's peace was never realized. I gave to the Ancients medicine and my calendar . My architecture was later taught to the Greeks and foreigners from the far reaches of my kingdom. Today even you study my edifices of old with awe, and utilize my concepts for your own. For I have appeared in the dreams of architects even to this da y, and what you see around you is of my essence. As vizier I was deemed mightier than my master , for I brought from out of the dark past many teachings that mere man alone could not d evelop. For three thousand years I was venerated by the people of Khem as a genius. My people were deserving of beauty, and were anxious to learn, and glorified all pursuits. My gifts to the time were the tools of the future. Look about you, I am here. For even though your wo rld be destroyed, my essence is forever in the desires of even one to build and renew. Shade # 2 - Nostradamus I was born Michael Nostradamus, a Jew-Christian in 1503. I came from physicians and astronomers. I became a born healer as remark able as Paracelsus. In my time, plagues and floods menaced my France. I showed the peopl e disinfectants and help ed the healings. I later became a prophet. I feared not from wh ere came these powers, but the people of my time thought me a Magus come from ancient tim es. For this I denied magic. The stake awaited witches then. I burned my magical t exts.

The Working Of The Eternal Source The \"Working of the Eternal Source\" presents initiates with the opportunity to explore and objectify that which resides within the innermost self. In order to accomplish this aim, component parts of darkness are explored, analyzed, and through a kind of alchemical process, resynthesized in a Willed form. At the core of the psyche lie keys to unlock these mysteries of the Self. Perils wait for the unsuspecting, however, and dangerous ar e the Guardians of your secrets. In order to pass through these doors, the Lurker s on the Thresholds require a Gift - some effort of Self-Understanding. The Waters of th e Well-Springs are not o fferred without peril. The Black Magician seeks to be able to part ake of the Grail's esse nce of darkness without drowning in the Waters. Each initiate is asked to bring two sm all drinking vessels to the ceremony. All participants should remain seated throughout the opening formula. After the Elemental Invocation, one initiate should ri se and proceed to the Station of the First Guardian of the Well. The Guardian will demand a \"sacrifice\" and if found acceptable, allow the Seeker to continue on the Quest. It is possible that each initiate will be Questioned three times. (Preparation for these questi ons is highly recommended.) If individuals complete their quests through th e maze, they will progress to the Nameless Personification of the Crucible of the Temple of Set. After meditation upon the Alchemical process, Inititates will progress to the main a ltar, where they should consume the synthesized essence and begin Individual Work.

Priests of Set would perform steps 5 and 6 (the Grail Ceremony a nd the Elemental Invocation). The Guardians were to be Magisters Templi, and the Sor ceresses were to be Magistras Templi. The \"Nameless Personification\" was Ma gister Stephen Flowers, and s itting on either side of the Crucible were to be the Ipsissimi. Because of the special circumstances surrounding this Conclave, not all parts were assigned as originally planned; adjustments were made as appropriate. Similarly, we don't expect any other gathering of Setians to have enough senior initiates participating to fill all of the expected roles. We do expect anyone planning a repeat of this Working to do their best to make the appropriate adjustments.

The questions, answers, and discussion there to one side, I would like to rela te the Working there - and to preface it with a remark: Who can say with precise Knowledge what will come forth in ritual? I had no idea the following would take place - only that the Working would be great. Magus Aquino led the ritual,and Se t did what I had least expected: rather than looking at the present or to the future, he asked me to turn my mind back in time, to see the Priest of his I was in old Khem. While still aware of the room , Set, and myself, it was as though looking in the pool of Remembrances - anot her scene was clearly there. I was told to walk the halls of the Temple at PaMat-et again, to enter the Sanctum, to feel the walls, to know they had been fashioned by man and would vanish. Next he said to look again on the Pentagram and to realize the ancient truth . What was it like? It was a natural feeling, a nd while I saw with a fi rst-person vision, Magus Aquino was seeing me in that setting with a s econd-person vision: I saw clearly the walls and floors as I proceeded, although I could not s ee myself while Magus Aquino saw me as I walked in that first Temple. The sanctum was sm all, or perhaps I had eyes only for that part bearing the Pentagram. Was it inlaid in the floor ing or in the wall? That detail has annoyingly faded. I know only that it was there - and it was a large version of the Temple of Set medallion. After being told to realize and remember the An cient Truth, I was told to think well on it. That which is Set walked forward and took my hands in a gesture that conveyed the message that Set IS and that we, his Priest hood, are deeply cared for by him. With that the ritual came to an end. What I had experienced was a ve ry real, quite sobering, and somewhat painful thing. Real in that it was indeed a scene from the pa st, and sobering in that such visions and words of truth from the Prince of Darkness cannot be regarded lightly. But why do I say \"painful?\" Because it answered a question I had been seek ing. My impression is that I had strayed for a while back to what I have come to refer to as the \"Game Room\" - White Magic. And that Ancient truth? Black Magic.

Few know the \"really strange trip\" my human life has been, but those few who do know will surely attest to that very fact. For a while did we talk of the past; my human life, the events of significance and those which were not. We talked of the Aeons, and how the Aeon of Set has always been and will always be.

Each stroke was to be as symbolic and yet as perfect as possible. At approxima tely 11:35 p.m. an inner pulse, an urge, came to write. What was written I didn't know, and so an attempt was made to dismiss the impulse. That proved more easily thought than done. At 11:38 p.m. I put brushes and palette aside, opened my Magical Diary, and began writing slowly yet surely.

I had an odd sensation about time after the final sentence; it seemed hours had been spent, and yet only seconds.

The Great and Treasured Wisdom has been a su bject of depth in Magus Barrett's Keys. As Xem of old saw the danger of destruction, the vanishing of the Priesthood of Set into the Amon cult was to preserve and transmit the Wi sdom. Yet before the vanishing, the holders were Guardians as well as teachers and leaders. The treasure had need to be guarded and my principle became Form in that which you see. Again, Guardianship is emphasized. Key #3 speak s of the Great Ones becoming the Principle of their Knowledge -- but Knowledge left ungua rded is open to destruction by those who cannot or will not understand; hence, a Form, a Neter great and terrible in appearance and Being came to be. Everyone has heard of bei ng thrown to the wolves, but Egypt had her crocodiles, as or more fierce than any wolf. St ories of a Being greater than any crocodile and fiercely protective of its treasure, I feel, led to the Principle Becoming Form. But \"in that which you see\"? The canvas before me? My Self? Perhaps both. Benign and malignant, I guarded. The Form could be a fierce destroyer to hands that would profane, yet kind and gentle to those of its own kind; much would depend on wh ich side of the Gate one stood. Again, Guardianship is stressed. Never did I die, nor can I be destroyed as long as the Gift is. Immortal and indestructible, the Dragon lives. It lives in, for, a nd through the Gift of Set. I see two (and possibly more) meanings to \"nor can I be destroyed.\" 1) \"And then the strength that is mine shall be the strength of the Setian, and against the Will of Set no creature of the Universe may stand.\" (2) Having become through the Gift, the Dragon maintains the original strength of the Setia n Will so that nothing can overcome it. 2) \"For with no purpose the force of the mind must fail...\" (3) There is purpose, for without it, the Wisdom would be nothing and Guardianship a frozen stasis meaning nothing. Yet there is purpose behind the force of the mind. The purpose is Life and continuous growth. To an end beyond Life? No, for the end is just that. An end. New challenges ceaselessly appear as soon as one challenge is overcome when one Live s. So never can the Guarding Dragon be destroyed, for he has purpose as long as the Wisdom exists. Look upon me.

Introduction to the Obsidian Shard June 29-30, XXVI The Obsidian Shard is a recording of an evo cation of the neter Anpu (or Anubis, from the Greek corruption) on the evening of April 24, XXVI A.S.

The text has a life of its own, and any attempts to expand or \"improve\" on it have proved futile. My work with the neter Anpu (or Anubis as I orig inally approached the neter) began after an illustrative ritual to explore the Word of Set. The Working concluded with an active invocation of the thirtieth Aethyr, TEX. While li ttle resulted from the Working at that time, a series of strange and disturbi ngly lucid dreams resulted later that night when I retired. The most powerful -- and significant -- of th ese was a dream vision involving Anpu. A series of pronouncements followed, of which I still ha ve little recollection. As I recounted to Magistra Linda Reynolds in a letter dated Sept. 21, XXIV: On August 1, XXIV, I conducted an illustrative ritual to deve lop an Understanding and feel for the Word of Set. While the ritual itself did not seem to produce much at the time, a strange set of dreams occurred when I retired later that evening. I remember a sudden feeling of falling and of then coming to rest, upon my hands and knees, on desert sands. It was cold, and I knelt below a brilliant starry sky. I th en proceeded to raise myself to my feet, when a huge towering bloc k of stone appeared before me. A deep voice came from above and behind this bl ock. It began to proclaim a seri es of items of which I have only vague memories. It was then that a dark fi gure of what seemed to be Anubis appeared on the rock... In time I began to Work with the neter Anpu, a nd intermittently, with the Nineteenth Part of the Word of Set. It was on April 14, XXVI that I conducted an invocation of the thirteenth Aethry, ZIM, and which subsequently led me to evoke the neter ten days later.

I laughed some to myself, and then decided to put everything away for a few days. Day after day passed, but I could not help thinking about what I saw. Finally, after not being able to take this anymore, I decided to conduct an instant G.B.M. rite to try and find out why this T.I.K.K.R.R. thing occupied my thoughts so much. The manner in which the rite was conducted was not so unusual, and so I think it unnecessary to go through each step. The following is a description of what occurred during the Working portion of the rite. The amount of energy present was phenomenal, not hing like I had ever before experienced. A golden glow soon surrounded the altar flame; th en the red lines of the Scrying Pentagram turned to gold, fading and then starting to almost flash. Following this, a very long line appeared at about the \"2:00\" pos ition in the atmosphere above the altar, and ran a length to about the \"7:00\" position. The line began to change back and fort h from silver to gold, but the constant changing wasn't as a flash; ra ther it was slow, almost like a pulse. I turned from the changing line above my altar back to the Scrying Pentagram. The lines in the Pentagram had morphed into what looked like a pair of scal es, but there were no pans. I thought this strange, and after wh at seemed to be only a few seconds everything just stopped, instantly. The action was like unplugging an el ectrical light ... and that's just about how drained of energy I suddenly felt. The rite was ended shortly afterwards. Interpretation: All I could figure at the time was that something was missing, because there were no pans on the scales formed in the Scryi ng Pentagram. Otherwise, I was still confused. Part 2 - March 16, XXVIII The purpose of this instant rite, the second of its kind within a week, was to better Understand the relationship, if any, between T.I.K.K.R.R. and the Principle of Maat. This rite was prompted so soon after the first, because of a discovery (?) which simply would not leave my mind: Using the methods in #4A from the Read ing List, the acronym T.I.K.K.R.R. adds to 13 and 33. Placed side by side, they're 1333. I was born at 1:33 p.m. - converted to military time 1:33 p.m. is 1333. I didn't recognize the coincidence (?) at first, but after some time it did hit me - like the proverbial ton of bricks. I actually thought for a time that I might be losing my mind, then decided not, and went on to conduct the instant rite a few days later. The following is what resulted from this second Rite of T.I.K.K.R.R. There were no visions during this rite, but pure Understanding only. Here is the Understanding: Humankind first experienced the principle of Maat when Set first bestowed his Gift upon that race. When Set recognizes a member of the hum an race as being one of his Elect, then he gives to this Being of his own Essence. Having been installed with Se t's essence, the elect being automatically experiences th e essence of Maat - th e intangible part of her infinite being. Maat is truly the first goddess, daughter of Set. It was the essence of Maat which Set brought into being when he first Willed his Self a being opposed to the cosmic order. Set gave her essence true form when he created HarWer in order for his Self to not only oppose the stasis, but be truly separate, defining his Self within his Self."},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"Xepera Xeper Xeperu Confirmation and Emulation Confirmation - July 8, XXVIII It was shortly after 10:00 p.m. C.D.T., and I had just lain dow n to think. I had been reading from the Ruby Tablet of Set , and wondered if perhaps my Work with Maat was moving in the wrong direction, and if all I had done in the past was nothing more than an illusion. To say the least, I was troubled. The room was completely dark; not even the table next to my bed could be seen. I finally said aloud, \"Set, if I'm wrong in my Work on Maat, th en tell me. And tell me why. Explain to me why I'm wrong. No, I'm not having doubts, really , but if what I'm doi ng is self-delusion, I need to know.\" Not long after I spoke - exactely how long I' m not sure - I \"saw\" Set standing in the atmosphere above and to the left of my bed. He smiled and I heard: \"You're not wrong. Remember what you read only a few hours ago. And remember what I created HarWer that I might define my Self. And remember that you are of me.\" I suddenly sensed HarWer's presence. but couldn' t actually \"see\" him. Then it struck me: To define my Self I must do what Set did... I mu st recognize / create my own \"HarWer\". To do this makes me the Center, my own Individual Center - that truly sets (Sets?) me apart from everything else as an Individua l being! This leads to one Becoming Maat. Again I \"saw\" Set. he turned his head towards me and it was as if I had been touched by high voltage wires. I felt as if I were about to explode, then all faded away. Somehow I knew I had changed. Later analysis: \"I was troubled.\" Magickal intu ition had led me to attempt an understanding of the Principle of Maat via combination of the Words Thelem a, Indulgence, Xeper, Xem, Remanifest, and Runa. I was troubled, because afte r reading the Xem Keys several hours before this Working, I began to wonder if I was on the wrong track - it appeared as if Xem alone would provide what I sought, instead of a co mbination of the six Words. \"You're not wrong.\" These words from Set eased my troubled feelings; I felt this to be a confirmation that my Work with Maat s hould continue along th e present course.

Around me ar e my now-customary sheets of paper and two pens. My deck of Thoth cards are within easy reach. My thoughts are turned inward, and I begin my j ourney to the House of Set, but this time my senses are more awake. I am aware of many mo re things happening than I have ever been aware of before. The walls of my chamber slowly become lighter in color, eventually transparent, and soon become as nothing. They are no longer there. It is now that I notice that I have risen above the floor, and that the walls have not so much vanished as I have left my chamber. Below me, far away, I see myself seated at my altar. Ev erything is intact. Now the blackness which surrounds me becomes more complete, eventual ly to eliminate all sources of light. I have been swallowed by the Night. Next, I experience the sensation and disorien tation of freely floating, weightless, amid the consuming blackness. One by one small points of light appear, and I am no longer floating aimlessly. My signposts have arri ved in the form of stars. My journey begins to pick up speed as I move faster and faster towards the massive stone structure in the distance. In general appearan ce the structure is mo re like the design of Imhotep than later architects. Th e exterior is covered with a po lished black stone, and inlaid at irregular intervals are hieroglyphs of gleaming s ilver. The entire struct ure revolves silently, exposing all sides to my view, its shiny blackness contrasted by the dull ebony surrounding it. As I approach the structure, I notice a small door at its base. My first thoughts are that the door is made of some sort of glass, but as I get closer I see that it is actually cut from a single piece of clear, quartz-like crystal. Although it is rather small, requiring me to stoop to gain entrance, the workmanship displayed by many f acets cut in the door is obvious. It seems to catch and reflect light fro m any convenient source. Once inside, I see before me a long, dark galler y. The walls appear to be covered with the same silvery designs that mark th e exterior of the building. They are the sole source of light.

This door too is small, requiring me to again stoop to cont inue my journey, though I do not have to stoop as far as for the first door. Other th an its blood-red color, and sligh tly enlarged size, it is exactly as the first door appeared. Although I am still within the gallery, I notice that now I am walking up an incline, though it is not extreme. Three hundred meters from the pr evious door I come to the first door to allow me to enter standing completely erect -- but ju st barely. The workmans hip of this door makes the previous two pale by co mparison. All about its shimmeri ng, mirror-like black surface are the now familiar silver hieroglyphs. Unlike the previous two doors, this door will not respond to the physical action of a push. Instead I merely think of the door as \"open,\" and it swings silently inward. Another four hundred meters more, and I am now standing before the largest and heaviest of the four doors. This door too is in laid with the pictographs, but is a deep royal blue in color. I make no effort to push against the door, in stead I use the method I had employed on the previous door -- and with the same results. I am now in Set's chamber. In the chamber I notice that th e stone comprising the walls are interlocking trapezoids, and I am curious as to why I failed to notice this fa ct on my preceding trips to the House of Set. Fascinated both by the cut of the large stones and their inlaid hierog lyphs, I approach the walls for closer scrutiny. The black walls are smooth, finely polished, as if they are made of glass. \"Jade,\" I say to myself. Though the air has a slight chill about it; the walls are warm, as if they are alive. The silvery hieroglyphs which serve the same func tion here as they did within the gallery, viz: illumination, seem to be breathing. Believing this to be a hallucination, I shake my head as if to clear it, and blink my eyes several times. The hieroglyphs still breathe. I am so absorbed in my thoughts and speculati ons concerning the reas on and nature of the hieroglyphs' strange phenomenon, that I fail to no tice for a time that I am not alone within the chamber. I turn around slowly to see Set sitting patiently in his throne-chair. I go over to the spot on the floor where I se e both pen and paper waiting, sit down upon the warm floor in an \"Indian style\" method, and pu ll my robe tightly around my knees to stretch my robe taut between them. I place the paper upon my lap, and the conversation begins ... The Dialogue: Set: Greetings, Ptah. Are you ready to conti nue our Work on the Book of Thoth? Ptah: Greetings, Prince of Darkness. I am indeed. Set: Before we begin, do you have a question regarding my House? Ptah:"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"I've noticed many things about the constr uction that I did not notice on my preceding trips. The walls, for example, cannot be of any substance I know of. I speculate that they are a manifestation of your creative Will. You would not have expended the energy for my benefit unless you expected me to learn something from them. So, before I ask any question of you regarding your House, I would pref er to think a bit longer. I would prefer not to waste your time with what may be an unintelligent question. If you do not mind? Set: [smiling] Quite so. Ptah: I do have one question, if I may, before we begin. Set: And it is? Ptah: I am presently seeing you as you have been classically represented by Khemite artists, that being a human male torso, arms, and legs, with an, excuse the term, \"animal's\" head. Your complexion is rather reddish in co lor. Your kilt is in the Khemite tradition, yet it is black. My question is esse ntially; is this your true form? Set: The answer is both yes, and no. It is at least the form by which man has known me for the last seven thousand years. If I had elected to appear before you in another form, you may have experienced any number of problems: suspicion, skepticism, confusion, even mind rebellion. As I have appeared before you in a form with which you are familiar, we dispense with such distractions that we may more effectively Work together. What prompted your question? Ptah: The desire to know. Set: If you are satisfied we sh all continue our Work. Ptah: I am satisfied. Set now rises from his throne-chair, and his tcha m scepter flies through th e air to rest in his left hand. As with the other cards preceding this one, he draws the scepter from his right to his left, and the card comes slowly into view. For the next several minutes I am sketching the card carefully and making notes re lating to color, shape, size, and geometry. I am careful to maintain proportional references. The strong sexual symbolism is maintained throu gh essentially similar shapes. Almost all of the colors, however, have been changed. The card is much brighter than the preceding design of Crowley, yet there are many points on which he \"hit the mark\" accurately. The two ellipsoids at the base of the cards are maintained, albeit in different colors and with different characters contained within them. The left ellipsoid is green [Viridian] with a la rge red [Cadium deep] \"sta r-burst\" at its center."},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"The right ellipsoid carries within it an exact copy of the Set figur e as he appears on the Temple's Stele of Xeper, but in color. Set himsel f is slightly reddish in color, and is wearing a black and red kilt. His pectoral, wrist, and a nkle bands are various combinations of blue [Thalo], purple [Ultramarine violet], and yellow [Cadium deep]. The scepter he holds in his right hand is of the same black as his kilt [Ivory], while his ankh is red [Cadium deep] to match the other part of his kilt. His headgear is red, but with a slight blue cast to it [Alizarin Crimson]. The background of the ellipsoid is a combination of both yellow and orange [Cadium deep, again], much like the presen t card demonstrates, although brighter. The shaft rising through the center of the card, an d the seven concurrent elliptical blue rings, is of the same blood red as Set's ankh."},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":" The three-eyed goat is gone, and in its stead is the figure of a man dressed in black. His clothing is extremely form-fitting, after the fashio n of a leotard or nylon stocking. In physical appearance he closely resembles a modern day body builder. A black cape with a lining of the same color as Set's headgear hangs about his shoulders."},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"The horns that protrude from the temporal areas of his head are much like the horns of the goat that he replaces, and brown in color. In hi s right hand he holds a tr ident equal in length to the man himself. This trident is a bluish-white , which it achieves due to its intense heat. The man is totally oblivious to this heat. In the ma n's left hand he holds a green [pale] bowl which is filled to the brim with a foul smelling though sweet tasting porridge. This porridge is brown in color, and a small amount of it seems to tr ickle down the side of the bowl. Visible fumes are rising from the bowl. The face of the horned man is much like Anton LaVey. The background of the card is a ni ght sky filled with stars. All of the planets ar e seen, yet the sun is absent. Above the man's head, between his horns, suspended in the air, is a white sigil of Baphomet [Titanium white]. Although this sketch is crude a nd incomplete [and deliberately s o, as to not influence Priest Bushey's understanding of the style he must em ploy to paint this card] , it should nevertheless give you some idea of the completed project. My apologies to the lovers of fine art... Ptah: I have finished my sketches and notes. Set: Good. Now we shall discuss the sym bols employed. You may begin where you choose. Ptah: I have noticed that this ca rd, like The Hierophant / Prie st of Set and The Emperor / Magister Templi, is extremely similar to th at card with respect to symbols which it replaces. This I believe is because the marg in of error in the old cards is less than those cards necessitating more radical design changes, such as The Star / Pentagram of Set and Art / The Golden Section. The astrological determiner is this time im plied via symbols, namely the twisted horns of the man-figure in the cente r of the card, rather than by color as you did with The Golden Section. The sexual symbolism of the card is stil l rather obvious, and seems to indicate a reveling in the so-called \"male\" principles of action, strength, power, and the like. The figure of your Self in the right ellipsoid is of course a re presentation of how you appear today, and makes obvious the link between the past Aeon and the present Aeon. It also demonstrates exactly who \"T he Prince of Darkness\" has been, and is now. Set: Yes, Ptah, but can you think of no other r eason why I should be depicted twice upon the card? Ignore the fact that I may assume whatever form I choose, and concentrate instead upon why I might be twice upon the same card. Ptah:"},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"[after several minutes...] I am aware this ni ght of something I have only rarely heard discussed among the Elect. Set: And that is? Ptah: That a Black Magickian has th e opportunity to experience or master temporal fugue -- the ability to be in two different places at the same time within a given reference of time. This night I am both here within your House, and yet I am also still within my chamber. Set: This is true. I can tell from your voice th at you obviously enjoy the experience, but it is not without some dangers. You are still capable of fee ling injury or pleasure done to your body in the realm of man, but your body in the realm of man ha s no knowledge of what you experience to this body here in my house. Your mind, how ever, is another thing entirely. Should your body in this realm receive either pleas ure or discomfort, your body in the realm of man would have no knowledge of it, though your mind would remember the experience if you so chose. Your mind, here by your Will, is truly cons cious only of this realm of existence. Should someone see your corporeal body, you woul d appear to be in a deep sleep or trance, Self-induced coma as you Will. Through all of this your mind is awake, and that part subject to the Great Order is under some measure of strain to allow your non-human Self to manifest itself here. This explains the high measure of fati gue you experience upon your return to the realm of man. Ptah: Then this is the truth behind the Ideas calle d \"astral travel,\" as it is misunderstood by the \"bungled and botched?\" Set: It is, but with a difference. Most non-Elect sources believe that there exists another realm of existence which they call either th e \"astral plane\" or \"astral dimension.\" In this \"dimension\" there is allegedly their other body waiting for them to be conscious of the \"fact.\" A variation on this theme is the idea of an \"eternal paradise\" and \"souls.\" The truth is, that my realm is empty of a ll else save mySelf unless you Will yourself to be here as you have done, Ptah. Ptah: Does this mean then, that I am not in reality here within your House? Set: No, it merely means that your strength of Will is such that you are able to visit my realm, create a body for the purpose of locomotion with which you are familiar, and Be. Remember your classica l philosophy: \"I think,...\" Ptah: \"... therefore, I am.\" Set:"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"And, as you think with greater skill, more clea rly and consistently in this, your natural realm, your existence is consequently more real than in any other realm. Now let us return to the card. Ptah: I admit to being baffled by the bowl in the horned figure's hand. Set: That brew, Ptah, is Promise. The promise of everything that is possible through the use of my Gift, that man has forgotten, rejecte d, avoided, condemned, or called \"sinful.\" It is the promise of Self and of Black Magick. It is the promise of all that men want, yet fear to taste. It is the promise of the Elect which overflows for want of those who Will brave the taste. There is no way that the tasting of Promise can be unconscious, and for that reason it tastes sweet, though it sme lls of the grave; the grave of humankind, and the sweetness of Self. Ptah: It is then the Promise that the Elect are charged to complete a nd that the non-Elect refuse to accept. Set: Quite so. [For the next several minutes I am permitted to ponder the importance of what has just been said, before we return to the discussion of the card...] Set: Why is it, Ptah, that the figure carries a trident? And a white trident at that? Ptah: It is superficially an atte mpt to capture the power of your tcham or uas, through a bastardized representation of your scepte r. I would guess that a common farm implement was chosen by the Judeo-Christia n corrupters of Khemite knowledge in an effort to diminish its grandeur. Quite simpl y, it is naturally associated with the image of a horned man. On a deeper level, it illustrates that rega rdless of the corruption given by others, the power is still \"there.\" The fact that the scepter is white serves to heighten this fact through the knowledge of the necessary leve l of power, or energy, needed to cause something to glow with such intensity. The figure holding the scepter is in total control of it, and una ffected by its heat. Set: Incomplete, but sufficient. Ptah: The man himself is dressed in the traditiona l colors of Darkness, viz: black and red. Even the complexion of the fi gure is slightly reddish, as is your own. His resemblance is markedly like the photos of Anton LaVey th at I have seen. This I believe to be your wish to remember kindly the Age of Sata n / Indulgence, without which purification would not have happened, and Xepe r would never have developed. I also get the feeling that this card's design would have been your design for The Aeon if this Work had been undergone some years ago. Set:"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"You are correct, though few at that time would have Understood it as we do now. Ptah: Far away in the background are the planets, silent soldiers of the Great Order. It is easy to see that all the other symbols are apar t from them. In fact, this design looks as though it is two different paintings sharing the same canvas. This too serves to intensify the feelings of separation between the groups of symbols. Each of the cards in some fashion points out the measure of separation between you and the Great Order, and/or the Elect and the Great Order. Set: At least that is how it appear s until you take that Symbol of the card to your Heart, and it becomes a part of you. Ptah: Shall we pursue this point? Set: Yes, but not now. In a few moments we will discuss it at some length. Ptah: Then I shall return to the card. The two ellipsoids at the base of the card, th e erect shaft at the center of the card, and the series of rings that the shaft is penetrating, are rather blatant symbols of the sex act. Other than those ideas we discussed earlier res: \"male\" principles, the sexual symbolism seems to indicate some kind of creation. This statement is again repeated through the interplay of colors at opposite sides of the color wheel, though the colors employed are of equal intensity. The right el lipsoid carries the product of the creation, namely, yourself. Set: Excellent, Ptah. Now we shall move on a nd begin our discussion of geometry and Number. Ptah: Before we begin. I would like to put a quest ion to you that has recently been of some concern to me regarding the Tarot. Set: What is it that seems to trouble you? Ptah: It is not so much that I am troubled, but rather, I am curious. Nothing more. Set: And your question is? Ptah: Why was I charged with the re sponsibility of receiving th e Tarot? Surely there are other Magickians who could as easily have done this? Set: The answer is two-fold, and lies partly within your Name and Function, which we shall discuss shortly. First you should know that it is particularly because your knowledge of the Tarot was so small that you were chosen."},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"Although you had some knowledge of Symbol, you would not feel the need to obscure the meanings of each card with repetitive or contradictory symbolism, as did the Beast. Ptah: Still, I have occasionally s uggested alternate or furthe r symbolism on some of the cards, with only occasional re jection from you -- the four corners of The Golden Section, for example. Set: When your suggestion comes from the Hear t, we create the card, Ptah. When you attempt to suggest from the mind, I must re ject your suggestion a nd create alone. A true symbol must be experienced, become one with the Heart. Anything less is merely a sign. Ptah: Anubis has spoken of this ... of the importa nce of Understanding a symbol correctly. Set: This is something you are learning to do more quickly. Where you once struggled, now you know. You can now create Symbol. Ptah: Does this mean that I must complete the Tarot without your assistance? Suppose I should err? The entire Book would suffer and consequently the Elect would be misinformed. Set: Your concern is unnecessary, as it is we who shall continue th is Work. In this attitude we shall be much like the Elect of old or the Pythagoreans, communicate what we must to those who can Understand, through Symbol. Ptah: Some will not Understand and take a false m eaning into their Heart. AnXembastet has already done so, and I fear there will be others. Set: There is nothing that you can do to prevent it, Ptah, and nothing that I will do. Ptah: Why? Set: Because if I make a Present of the knowledge of Symbol to the Elect, then they will have learned little, lost much, and will fail to keep in their Heart that which I might teach them. I have given each of you intelligence and the Black Flame, that you might Become as Xem. There is much that all of you must do if you are to accept this charge, and if I should become the Light I shall cease to be the Darkness. Each of you must find and create your own light within th e darkness, or the Journey c eases to have any meaning - - either for you or for me. Ptah: I Understand. Set: Then let us proceed. The other reason you were charged with the Tarot deals with your Name and Function."},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"Ptah: But we started Work on the Book of Thoth several months before I knew my Name, and even longer before I had any idea of the nature of my Function. Set: It is your fault that you did not know your Name. Ptah: I did not intend to sound accusatory. Set: You did not. I merely stated a fact. You remained ignorant of your Name because you did not press the issue at the time. In stead, you preferred to acquire knowledge through reading and Working, so that you might Understand. Some of the Elect discover their correct Name la ter than others, as you did. Ptah: And finally knowing my Name will help me understand why I was chosen for the Tarot? Set: Precisely. Now, tell me briefly what you Know and Understand of Ptah. Ptah: My Understanding of Ptah is based almost entirely on intuition and related Workings. The books that I had consulted to help me in this endeavor were contradictory and confusing. Eventually only the illustrations of Ptah proved to be of any value. Set: And what did they teach you? Ptah: That only Ptah is seen as possessing all thr ee forms of scepters; the djed, the ankh, and the uas or tcham. These are supposed to repr esent stability, life, and the authority of your Word, respectively. Ptah is also shown in a cloak or shroud in statuary, his arms, legs, and torso hidden from view. In paintings, however, he is not always so confined. Hi s cloak is discarded in favor of either a kilt or a loincloth, and his limbs become visible. This tells me that Ptah may possess some special cache of inform ation that he usually keeps hidden from the eyes of the \"bungled and botched\" until th e time is right for him to \"open up\" and reveal his information, at least that potentia l is there. I also se e Ptah as a contained Neter in the sense that he is non-hysterical. He may be occasionally sensitive to one emotional extreme or the other, but this is a short-lived event as he quickly \"returns to center.\" His tight fitting skullcap draws attention to your Gift , his intellect, and makes no attempt to hide it under another form of headdress as other Neters wear. He also wears a rather enigmatic smile upon his face that is not too different from the Priest of Set card [Atu V]. Set: How does all this relate to the Book of Thoth? Ptah: In the sixth Sonnet you told me that I would restore Sanity and Balance to the Book of Thoth. The djed being a symbol of stability is representative of this aspect of that charge, for the stability so repres ented is Magickal in nature."},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"The ankh is symbolic of the new life that you and your Words have breathed into the new Elect. In order to proclaim this Trut h to all who can see, the Tarot too must become alive with these lessons. Ptah is th erefore entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring this life. The third scepter is a visible sign indicati ng by whose authority Ptah is charged with this task. Set: Quite well done, Ptah. Do you understand why Pt ah is frequently not seen in a moving posture? Why is his animal aspect most frequently seen as an Apis bull? Ptah: Both of these representations have also been misunderstood for too long. Many did, and still do, believe this to mean that Ptah makes no progress. Set: Yes, but this is easily countered by the Mastery of your Being. Ptah: I agree, yet the myth persists. These att itudes of seeming immovability actually reflects the singleness of purpose, not ve nturing down tributaries, but instead preferring to remain on the main course of the journey to Xem. In the realm of man this is sometimes patronizingly called \"having a one-track mind.\" Set: This too relates to the Tarot. Can you see the connection? Ptah: It is this aspect that makes me treat this charge with the level of seriousness that I do. I must ensure that the Tarot is received and executed correctl y. It may be partly because of the previous painter's failure to adhere to my instructions concerning the Tarot, preferring instead to design the cards he rself, that she became Mad and is now Magickally dead. Set: In your pursuit of excellence, many will fail to understand and consequently consider you a tyrant in this area. Ptah: This will cause me no discomfort so l ong as the Tarot is as it should be. Set: Then I have chosen you rightly? Ptah: I believe so. Ptah is sometimes known as \"t he Father of Forms,\" and as each of the new designs reflect Form, even those inaccurately considered as notices of initiation, such as the Priest of Set card, the job is well within Ptah's right to execute. Set: Then before we begin our discussion of the ge ometry of this card we must reveal the true name of the Book of Thoth, the Tarot. Now the Work shall be known as The Ptah- rot. The rest of the Working was consumed with the discussion of shapes, angles, and spatial relationships, all of it meaningless until the time when you can have the card before you.

Also needed is some sort of stiff cardboard or posterboard, a straight edge, and a knife or scissors. Place the center of the protractor over one of th e corners of the posterboard. Line it up on the protractor's bottom edge and the 90° mark on th e protractor, and measure out the angle of 72°, and mark it on the board.

I usually find the exact center of the object that I wish to draw the pentagram on, mark it clearly, and draw one lin e straight down from this point . Place the 72° triangle you created above so that the 72° angle rests on the exact cen ter mark, and one of the sides of the triangle rests on the vertical line. Draw the other side's line, which should be exactly 72 degrees away from the vertical. Repeat the above procedure goi ng either clockwise or counter clockwise three more times, and you should have the beginni ngs of the pentagram. The next thing you will have to determine is the diameter of the Pentagram. Once that is determined, just draw the legs out as far as you need to, and ma rk the ends clearly. The last thing that needs to be done is to draw the Pentagram outline itself, which should be the easiest part (just connect the dots).

The method used is very simple, and the result is stri kingly beautiful and sharp. I use the above method to draw the pentagram di rectly on the glass, using a china marker or grease pencil to draw the pentagram. Using either 1/2\" or 3/4\" wide cl ear adhesive tape, I lay the tape down on the pentagram (either on the inside or outside of the line, but being consistent). I use the knife to cut away the ex tra tape and make the points look nice and sharp. The tape defines the pentagram. The next step requires a can of bl ack spray paint. I prefer flat finish. I spray the entire mirror with an even coat of paint, and let it dry fo r two or more days. Be sure to wait long enough ... I personally found out just how messy the resu lts can be when I di dn't wait long enough! After two full days of drying, just carefully peel away the adhe sive tape and you will have a real work of Art!! Another visually effective pentagram is one that is outlined with florescent colors on a flat black surface, and lit by an ul traviolet (black ) light. The method I use to get around using the florescent paint is to buy some florescent bumper sticker material, and to cut it into uniform strips around 1/8 to 1/2 inches in width, and 11 or more inches in length. I then use these to outline the pentagram. By using this bumper sticker material there is no painting involved, just peeling off the backing and being careful on how it is laid down on the surface. Most office supply or print shops should have some of this material on hand. Starlit Magic \"But speak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier.\" - The Book of Coming Forth by Night Once in conversation with a III° member, the to pic of ritual chambers came up. We spoke of his chapel and I brought out that while indoo r chambers have many positive aspects, I thoroughly enjoy holding a cerem ony outdoors. Magister Barrett, Priest Murray, and others who have experienced this will know what I mean about working without walls, but let me share this with some of you who might, circumstances requiring, hold indoor ceremonies only.

So, to this end, we either hold it back and down or go to the expense of soundproofing the ritual chamber insofar as is possible For my own part , \"holding it back and down\" is distracting and s oundproofing a waste of money. My home is nine miles from the city limits and my nearest neighbor a mile away. There are no street lights to attract inse cts, no honking horns to disturb th e silence, no sirens, no sounds of neighbors, and no neighbors to wonder about sounds. One definite advantage I have found is that th e limitation of the surr oundings is missing. Do I want an area closed in by trees? Or perhaps one that is open? They are available simply by choosing the site. Whichever, something there is about standing robed amid the darkness, and seeing the stars overhead like hu rled diamonds that emphasizes the vast power of Set, the Setian, and the ritual. Ritual is a changing of things. The Black Magici an changes and defies the rules of the Greater Law to suit his purpose; he ch anges the methodic order in wh ich things and events would otherwise fall. It is part of Xeper that we change and grow, and that with growth comes greater insight. One point I have come to unde rstand is the statement of Set to Magistra Sinclair: \"The Stars, look to the Stars, my Daughter, it is there you shall find me.\" (1) The wording is impressive and beautiful, but I had no great appreciation of it until under the open sky of midnight I also looked to the Stars. The statement took on a new meaning that is a bi t difficult to express in words. It was as though I had become aware of Something that was aware of me. Something big, something powerful, but something benign and moreover, So mething that was aware of me long before I was aware of It. The feeling, the awareness, was more intense than I have described it here, but then it was not a situation that easily lent itself to description. Going back to the setting, as beautiful as it is , it has its drawbacks, if not outright dangers. Forests and fields abound with snakes, and beli eve me city dwellers, six feet, six LONG feet of rattlesnake, is NOT a pleasan t thing to come upon at 11:56 p.m. The rattlesnake at least gives warning of his presence; copperheads and moccasins do not. Now and then I get a somewhat uneasy feeling that Yig re ally does exist at such times. But one learns to deal with the Children of Yig, along with skunks, deer, inquisitive cattle, and myriads of other animals that turn up to see what is going on. It is all worth it, however, when the ritual begins and there is the sudden feeling of some thing changing in the atmosphere and something Else is present. Magistra Wendall has written of familiars in ch amber. Seeing the behavior of my own dogs and cats with the combination of ritual and the outdoors, I agree with her. Each canine becomes a representative of Anubis, and each fe line a priestess of Bast. In their own ways they understand and add to rather than detract from the ceremony. There is pro and con about outside workings. As you may note, I enjoy them. I admit that a ritual chamber with all the tools is an impr essive thing that can add considerably to a ceremony, but the important thing is not the ch amber, but the Setian and how he can best utilize the surroundings and tool s at hand.

Setian Elemental Rite Introduction Purpose : The purpose of this working is to establish a symbolic association between the traditional magickal elements and the aspects of self, among and within the participants. This working is designed to use traditional symbolism and subjective suggestion in order to draw to the surface the unrealized aspects of self, that they may be examined (or rather confronted) by the participants. The purpose of this confronta tion is familiarization of the total self with the individual aspects or components of self; the ultimate goal is the establishment of a control base by which th e total self may manipulate the individual components of self. It is only by true realization and examinati on of self that magicians may take serious measures to alter their selves, in order to achieve balance, harmony, and ideally, perfection of being. This working is also designed to introduce the pa rticipants to the elemental forces as they relate to the self, and to suppl y the individual partic ipants with a workable set of symbolic magickal keys. Those keys are the symbolic elemental representations or tools by which magicians may gain access to th eir individual or combined asp ects of self. By focusing their will, magicians may then consciously mani pulate the particular aspect(s) desired. The ultimate outcome of this process is a more complete recognition of the aspects of self, and the creation of a means by which magicians may alter their own beings, both objectively Classification: V2 - C15.5R - 1 Author: Arnold R.

The Rite Outline and Preparatory Notes: I. Dress for working If possible, all participants s hould anoint themselves in the location of the Third Eye with consecrated Musk oil, to symbolically draw atte ntion to the Third Eye, or Eye of Set, and to its subjective activation as a result of the anointing. II. Assemble devices, and Prepare the Chamber The alter is placed in the south, due to the trad itional association between Set and the south, as well as to create a focal point by which the pa rticipants may induce positive self change by using the elemental forces which are attributed to the south, namely the Fires of self change and the Fires of creation. On the altar are the traditional devices used in Setian ritual, with the inclusion of a red candle to represent the element of fire, a yellow rose to represent the element of air, a quartz crystal pyramid to represent the element of earth, and a wine-filled chalice to re present the element of water. Also included on the altar are wand and dagger, the fire wand used to banish the objective bodies, and the air dagger used to invoke the elemental forces. In the center of the altar is an Enochian Table of Union, representing the union of the elements of self within our beings and the stat e of balance of the aspects (or elements) which is our goal. Around the Table of Union are the corresponding elem ental tools acco rding to the tools' directional attribute. To th e left of the table is the air da gger; to the right the fire wand. Any elemental representations may be used to ma rk the directions of the elements on the wall of the chamber, as long as they are visually impacting enough to evoke proper response from the participants. (My personal chamber, used fo r this rite, is painted gloss black and has a gloss red ceiling. I also have a permanent set of elemental tablets hanging in the chamber.) In addition four wooden bowls, each containing sand and charcoal, are used as censers. One wooden bowl or censer should be placed belo w each elemental tablet, along with the appropriate incense to be ignited dur ing the invoking of that element. The incenses I chose for this particular rite were: South: Fire Sandalwood East: Air Frankincense North: Earth Pine Resinv West: Water Myrrh"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":" Also, a combination of these resins is used in the later part of the rite to produce a pleasing and balancing effect w ithin the chamber. Note that we use only one grai l during the rite, since this grail is the central symbol representing the element of water, and is essentially eucharistic in nature. Before the rite, all participants are briefed a nd then they discuss the elemental attributions associated with the magickal devices to be used in the rite, as well as the association between the elements and aspects of self. (See appendi x I for further explanation of the elemental aspects of self, and for the elemental correspond ence associated with the magickal devices or tools.) All participants are also briefe d on the different visual images to be used during the rite, and each step of the rite is explaine d in detail to insure that the proper atmosphere is maintained during the rite, and that the desired results will be obtained from the working. (See appendix II for notes on the types of visua lization used during the rite.) III. Banish Objective Bodies The objective bodies are banished to subjectively remove a ll normally perceived objective points of reference by which the participants mi ght associate themselves with the objective universe, thus creating a to tally subjective atmosphere (or void) for the working. During this particular stage of the working, the ch amber is to be visualized by all participants as being suspended in space, surrounded only by celestial bodies, the stars, Moon, Earth, other planets, and Sun. Each objectiv e (or celestial) body is then banished, using an averse banishing pentagram. Averse pentagrams are used in order to differentiate objective existence or reality from subjective reality. This is also due to the fact that the followers of the right hand path, at least in part, hope to draw thei r power from the objectiv e realm, whereas the black magician realizes that the true source of his power is his own subjective universe. This particular part of the working is accomplis hed using the fire wand, due to the association between the fire wand and the aggressive and for ceful nature of fire, as well as the traditional use of the wand by ceremonial magicians for banishing.

Reinvoke of Objective Bodies. The objective bodies are now reinvok ed using the Air dagger in the same fashion as they were banished. The participants should visualize the celestial bodies returni ng to their original positions, thereby reconstructing the objective universe by force of their wills. It should be noted that with the reinvoking of the objective bodies, the elements of spirit active and spirit passive are not reinvoked. Thes e particular elements are omitted in order to draw attention to the fact that spirituality shoul d be approached on a subj ective basis, and that we as Setians are free from the restraints of objective spirituality due to our advanced understanding of our inner selves.

The Rite is concluded w ith the utterance of the tradi tional words by all assembled: So it is done. "},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"Results The results of this working were mixed, but all pa rties involved agreed that they had gained a new sense of inner balance and harmony from the proceedings (as is suggested in the text itself), as well as a new outlook on the traditional elements as they pertain to the self. During the working, one participan t envisioned a spiral staircas e travelling infinitely upward. This, I suggested, could represent her newly di scovered ability to manipulate the aspects of self, or possibly her yet-undisc overed potential for self-develop ment, that may be manifested through her use of the elemental symbols or keys (as represented in this rite) during her future endeavors in the area of G.B.M. During the invoking of the elemental forces, al l participants experi enced very different sensations, and received varied images associated with these forces. Some examples of these are: black, blue, and red flames for fire; wind, sky, and clouds fo r air; dense woods, forests, and desert for earth; and waves crashing upon a rocky shorelines, or a spring, for water. Ultimately, I believe that the goals of this work ing were achieved, and that all involved gained valuable insights into their own existences. I al so believe that all who participated in the working left the chamber with a new sense of pers onal control, as well as with a new and very usable set of magickal tools with which to maintain and execute that control towards the realization of their goals, be th ey the goals of Xeper and Remani festation, or the search for the ever-beckoning pres ence of Runa.

When performing the Banishing and Invoking of the Objective Bodies, the members of the assemblage should, upon the drawing of the sa id pentagrams, visual ize the pentagram as being drawn in the form of flames in the colo r associated with that element. The flames should be visualized as coming from the tip of the Fire Wand or Air Dagger, which ever the case may be, and should remain until such a ti me as the invocator moves on to the next element. 2. During the Banishing of the Objective Bodies the members of the assemblage should, upon the drawing of the banishing pentagrams, visual ize the objective bodies associated with that element as travelling a great distance from the location of the chamber and far out of the sight and minds of the participants. After all of the objective bodies have been banished and have left the vicinity of the chamber, the chamber shou ld be visualized in su ch a way as to create the impression that the chamber is suspende d in a timeless and spaceless void, in total darkness, far from any influence th at might affect the working. 3. During the invoking of the elemental forces th e same technique of visualization of the invoking pentagrams should be used, with the add ition of the elemental symbols that are to be drawn in the center of the pentagrams, namely the Sign of Leo for Fire, the Sign of Aquarius for Air, the Sign of Taurus for Earth, and the Sign of the Eagle for Water. 4. Just prior to the drawing down of the elemental forces, in order that they may be combined and balanced within the Table of Union, all pa rticipants should visu alize all the elemental pentagrams and signs as glowing together in their respective locations. Following the invocator's motions the members of the assemb lage should visualize the elemental forces, represented by the elemental pentagrams and the si gns therein, as being directed one by one to the Table of Union. The assemblage should then visualize the balancing of these elemental forces within the confines of the table. 5.

Do they really come down to us from sources as ancient as fabled Atlantis or great Egypt? Probably no t, but their origin is academic insofar as actual use goes for the Se tian. Since in a Lesser Black Magical aspect they are merely tools of infulence and understa nding, the paths of the tarot through history are unimportant. William Claude Dukinfield's nasal \"C all them what you will...\" best sums up the question of the Tarot's lineage. There are any number of methods of laying the cards out. Each is valid only as far as it gives meaning for the Magician performing the readin g. I have seen rather elaborate layouts for the cards which were equalled in power and pot ency by simple placements; neither approach should be considered as incorrect. The main point to bear in mind is that the Ta rot is an instrument for bringing about desired or W illed changes. Recalling this will prevent any confusion between the steak and the sizzle. [T he comparison is used with apologies to R.N.G.M.O.V.] Priest Roger Whitaker has a file on the National Satanic Bulletin Board entitled The Inverted Pentagram Layout . It is well worth placing here because of its insight into the question of a Tarot layout. I have never been much for the complicated la youts that are often de signed for placing the tarot cards. Understanding that the spatial significance of a card should be apparent on its own regardless of a physical position, I came to use the Inverted Pentagram Layout. There are a couple of qualifications. • 1. You need to be comfortable enough with the cards - and know them well enough - that you can easily do a reading with five to six cards. Period. • 2. Do not give any of the positions pre-imposed designations such as \"the lower point of the pentagram represents an element of the past\" et c. Lay the cards out in any order you wish. • 3. After you lay the cards out, study them and then give them specific designations is you wish as you apply them to the context of the reading. An inverted pentagram layout is specifically that. One card will represent each of the five points of the pentagram - in this case an upsid e down star. An additional card may be placed in the center if absolutely necessary. The most essential and sublime use of the Tarot is that of an initiatory tool for the individual aspirant. I'd rather read a \"soul\" than a \"fort une\", I'd rather read a chart a course than be taken down one not of my own maki ng. You Adepts should understand this.

If the Tarot is designed to serve as a means of performing magic, it doubles as a portr ayal of a soul's travel through the various manifestations of life. Trump 0 has been interp reted in a number of ways. It has been called the Green Man of pagan festivals, Osiris, a cr owley self-portrait, and the Ipsissimus, among others. Each interpretation is valid as applied to individual readings and circumstances. The figures about the horned humanoid show th e world of experience awaitening the touch of the magician's hand. Fire, crystal, water, wealth , violence, regeneration - all serve in the ways determined by the paths of Will. The Fool is a fertile being and one who finds prosperity in all that his hands rouch. Of particular prominence is the endless loop filling and renewing itself in the Fool's heart. The essen ce of the Fool is that of creat ive light stemming from continuous Remanifestations of the Self. The horns indicate a divine nature. Like many a figure of demonic history, the presence of horns where none should be hint at an alien ancestry of the livi ng creature occupieing Atu 0's center. We are familiar enough with horns: Satan was supposed to have them, although they are more likely a racial memory of an older form of deity, Set himSelf. All other facets of the Trump aside, it shares something in common with all the other Atus in that it has a basic message which Aleister crowley attempted to get across to the users of the Thoth Deck, that point having to do with the pres ence of the Self and its potential. Note that while The Fool is surrounded by the symbols of power, he is not actually parttaking of any of them. They are nearby, but not being made use of . All other tools and weapons of being come into use later on the Fool's trav els along the Path if Atu 0 is s een as the first Trump. if it is placed and the very end of the series, the objec ts and powers become tools which have been made use of and are no longer needed after the expansion and exercise of the magical muscles of the Being. Whichever, the potential spoken of is vast. The Trumps go from The Fool to The Universe and tell the story of a soul's j ourney through the cosmos. he begins with an awareness of his Self and ends with a functi oning universe of his own making. In part The Fool is also a self-portraif of Aleister Crowley: the number of the card 0 and the naught about it brings to mind Perdurabo, that which endures unto the end. I suggest however that the end which the name of the Initiate conveyed a nd the number of the Atu have two opposite nuances. Perdurabo's zero was an option which might or might not take place depending entirely on his own unique Will. The Fool's zero is the designation of a starting point [or the"},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"door to a new world] towards a series of fin ite experiences through the cosmos. It would be incorrect to automatically assume infinity to be ahead. The questing soul will have many a danger ahead of it along with having a say in its own continuation as its attention span takes and acts upon such events as is possible for it. The Fool is not foolish. He is the entity energized by that wonder known as life and is about to take his first step [or first new step} toward Setamorphosis. Trump I The Magus Aleister Crowley's work during the Aeon of Ha rWer established guidelines for Initiatory recognitions and these directives are reflected in the stroke s that came from Lady Frieda Harris' brushes. In the case of Trump I, those portrayals are expressed at the first glance by gold, a thing still capable of attracting attention. The gold of Trump I is the treasure of wisdom. Not only is the fi gure of the Magus entirely of the gleaming color, but also all things proceeding from him share in the wealth. Note the pen and scroll above the figure's right and left shoulders. Both are of gold and symbolize th e treasure to be founf in the Magus' writings. Aleister Crowley was no rabbi with a congreation of one and his idea of showing the writings of a (9)=[2] as precious is not simply megalo mania. The new interpretations coming from the pen of a (9)=[2] extend to all things and in the case of the Tarot the disks, wands, swords and cups take on newer and more up to date meanings . It is vital to remember that the arrival of the Aeon of HarWer changed a great many things , not the least of which was the tide of questing. I have often commented that an Ae onic Word impacts on a ll things and it is a statement I stand by to this day. [The impact of a Word, if you would care to watch a Fictional analogy, can be seen in the old James Steward m ovie, It's a Wonderful Life. \"It's funny,\" says Clarence to the angel, \"how the life of one ma n will touch the lives of so many other people.\" Although the film is Christmas or ientated, it is worth watching if only to observe and compare the workings of Aeonic-Word lines of Magic.] If \"all that gleams is not gold\" is true, then some things that gleam are gold; it is up to the In itiate to search out and decide what is or is not of value, a thing he does by applying the principles of the Word and message of the Magus. perhaps Crowley had that old sa ying in mind when he wrote in the Book of Thoth those references to illusion, deception, ambiguity, and falsehood. It may be that in these days of sophistication that the reason of presenting Thoth as being trailed by an ape has less meaning than in earlier years. On the other hand, after havi ng witnessed many a crash over the years, I will reserve judgement in the matter. The meaning behind Trump I, and behind those othe rs, is more or less hidden behind a certain problem. To refer again to the Book of Thoth , \"The present card endeavors to represent al l the above conceptions. Yet no true image is possible at all; for, firstly, all images ar e necessarily false as such; and, secondly, the motion being perpetual, and its ra te that of the limit, c, this picture is, therefore, hardly more than mnemonic jottings.\" Magus Crowley's personality is descri bed concisely and accurately in the Book of Coming Forth by Night by Set himSelf. I recall having read an OTO newsletter once in which the old Beast was referred to as having kicked higher Ini tiates out od the nest as soon as they cropped"},{"pageNumber":920,"pageContent":"up. I do not doubt this in the least. It is cause for no little head shaking that on the one hand he clearly documents paths around potholes and then ju st as blithely gives valuable Initiates the boot. The main point in inserting the quote is that it is a paragrahp everyone delving into the Tarot should keep in mind. The wings from the figure's feet have severa l clear and generally personally applicable interpretations. The most obvious symbolism is the pictured reference to Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, himself having winged feet - which in return represented the swiftness of his work. [Another and perhaps forgotten reason for s eeing angels as having wings? Angels, I recall from elder days, are the thoughts of God made visible. The belief smacked somewhat of applesauce in my younger days. My opinion remained unchanged.] In these days of the Aeon of Set we have little need for a symbol to tell us that xeper acts, as does its Aeon, with progressive speed since the dynamics seem to bear out the lessons of theory. Although noone can know the Word of a Magus in exactely the same way the (9)=[2]/V° does, those seekers along the trail of th at Word can share in th e benefits of it, not simply to be able to do minor Magics that ma ke stand non-magicians stand in wonder, but to use that knowledge as a foundation to raise th e knowledge and awarene ss even higher. This may be another reason that Trump I flows upwar d in its lines and show s fluid action rather than a frozen stasis. Trump II The Priestess The Priestess, Trump II, known in some decks as the High Priestess, is one of what de Givry refers to as one of the si x titled personages belonging to human society, the other five according to that author being (in the older style titles) the Pope, the Empe ror, the Juggler, the Empress, and the Hermit. It was de Gebelin, according to de Givry, who attempted to place the Tarot figures into a logical arrangement and thereby find correlations between the deck and society. The relationships he advanced are of passing interest and are worth mentioning if only for the further corresponden ces of the Thoth Deck and the Thelemic/Satanic/Setian interpretations. The six titled personages: The Pope The Emperor The Juggler The High Priestess The Empress The Hermit The two allegorical personages: The Devil Death The four cardinal virtues (with the Hanged Man as prudence):"},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"Justice Strength Temperance Prudence The three astronomical elements: The Sun The Moon The Star The two elements of fate in human life: The Lovers The Wheel of Fortune The four elements in cosmic fate: The Chariot The Judgement The World The House of God A flaw, insofar as Setians will see de Gebelin 's theory, is that he places no emphasis on Trump 0 [The Fool] and sees its appearance as having no meaning. The correspondences above are listed in order to open the doors of thought to the Thoth Deck as they may have meaning for the Setian look ing not only for current nuances related through the cards, but also in the dire ction of historical relevance. Now back to the second Trump. \"This card,\" wrote Ipsissimus Crow ley, \"represents the most spiritual form of Isis the Eternal Virgin; the Artemis of the Greek s.\" Beyond the fact that Trump II displays a perfect balance, one of the key points to observe is the cluster of forms about the base of the card. Crowley relates that these are the begi nnings of life. When coupled w ith the balanced lines of the Priestess, the veiled figure becomes a goal to be attained, a Xem, an aristos to be sought. On her own the Priestess is not th e last word; it is her wisdom those first stages of life will eventually find themselves search for ra ther than the feminine for itself. The Book of Thoth hints at this when speaking of the veil of li ght surrounding the Prieste ss: \"She is the truth behind the veil of light.\" Crowley goes further ye t and identifies the card's shrouded figure as the goddess Nuith, the \"possibility of Form\". It is that last which gives the card a more Setian appeal. It is also that which catches the eye: that possibility of Form, or as we might say today, the potential to Xeper by making use of th e material available to fashion a whole which is more than the sum of its parts. The presence of the camel can be found in the Book of Lies and again in the Book of Thoth . The symbolism of that animal has suffered by the progress of the Aeons and Ages; what had far more meaning in the Aeon of HarWer ha s today become primarily academic for the majority of Tarot users and students, although to the Master of the Temple the V.V.V.V.V. occurence will have more meaning than to those of Degrees before the Fourth."},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"As with all of Lady Harris' reprinted work s, the beauty of th e card is obvious. The mathematical precision of curves, lines, and angl es is splendid while th e brush strokes manage the correct designs and encourage seekers to look more closely yet find the veiled truths of the Atus. The importance of this message and the linking \"possibility of Form\" should not be overlooked. The Words from the Aeon of HarWer on are keys to providing substance to such possibilities: Aeon: HarWer Word: Thelema Message: A statement and definition of the consciousness as a separate and unique component for each Being (or Star). Aeon: Satan Word: Indulgence Message: The individual Will need not simply lie dormant. It can be used to search for the fine and great rather than the dust of eart h. It can and should be highly selective. Aeon: Set Word: Xeper Message: The selective Indulgence of the Satanic Age is given a definite direction; the appreciation of the finest is not enough and ne ither are earthly treasures the last word. Come Into Being that you may open your hand to cr ush or create an universe as you Will. It is possible to take those brief interceptions of the Aeonic Words much further and into far greater detail than you see above since each Initia te will interpret their manners of impact on his or her life and progress personally rather than merely relying on the word of another. Like textbook normals of human chemistries and vital signs, \"normal\" is only a word used as a vague point of reference. Each human body, lik e each individual Will, is unique and will allow only its own concept of an absolute. Trump III The Empress Trump III, The Empress, is a card of feminin ity and flows with all the subtle grace of the gender. The Empress herself, th e lotus of Isis, the pelican feeding her young, and the cradling protective movements of the figure within the ca rd's frame serve to point toward the \"Great Mother\" aspect spoken of in the Book of Thoth . The card, like its fellows, has a number of messa ges relevant to the individuals examining it - it is somewhat amusing to note the extreme and ra dical feminists sem to go all out in left field when encountering Trump III. For those among us who might have somewhat more objective and calmer outlooks, Trump III speaks not of th e Shea and Wilson 93 feet tall goddess Eris, but of a serene aspect of what Crowley referred to as \"...a continuity of life, an inheritance of blood, which binds all forms of nature together.\" This binding of the forms is a subtle hint into what Trump III's bedrock is working toward displaying. If we remember the Empress as the Mother, we have part of th e initial puzzle solved. The femini ne form, starting at the basics of not only Trump III, but also Trump II (The Priestess), shows woman as the \"many-throned, many-minded, many-wiled, daughter of Zeus\" and th erein is another door left ajar to help"},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"understanding the Tarot's capabili ties. The Mother image provide s a secure inner environment from which the higher aspects can be launched wi th only minimal intrusions from the outside world. [Do not read this as a mother-hen situ ation, but rather as a secure and self-founded inner universe.] Such a security may be what the 6th Century Indian philosopher Shankara advocated when he concluded that it was thr ough thought alone that man could triumph over the evils and tribulations of life. Our own ph ilosophies lead away from Shankara's, however, when he advocates thought as the path to one ness with the world-soul, Brahman. Yet he does have valid points in his system. Max Fishler, writing about them in 8 BAES, broke Shankara's discipline down to four steps: I. \"Discrimination between things eternal and no n-eternal.\" Fishler sees this as the power to distinguish reality. Trump III could be seen as one which shows a garden where such perceptual powers can emerge. II. \"Renunciation of the enjoyment of rewards here and in the other world.\" Shankara saw little in ordinary life to gratify spiritual de mands. Setian thought has th e benefit of Thelema, Indulgence, and Xeper to show the Initiate ot herwise. The Empress veers away from such renunciations since she cannot renounce and still nurture. III. \"Moral preparation.\" Fishler interrupts and restates this by saying that \"he who seeks the truth cannot long allow himself to be enslaved by existing things.\" He further sees this as a supreme detachment and the liberation and the libe ration from desire. Again, this is fine if the Initiate aims for absorption of his self with th e cosmos. Viewed in this light the Empress is neither enslaved by or indiffere nt to her objective and subjectiv e posessions. She is instead in full possession of the understandi ng necessary to utilize them. IV. \"A longing for liberation.\" It is integral to freedom to firs t want liberation and then to attain it through desire and work. This is one of the aims of the Empress - she wants her children to be filled with the longing for freedom. Like the basis for education in the city- states, the Empress does not want enlightened masses, she wants uncommon individuals. The chances for her succ ess are quite good. It may well be that Crowley never once consider ed Shankara's four main steps - there was no reason he should have done so in the first place. There is really no reason to look for purposeful similarities in the thoughts of the two philosophers, but I hazard a guess that the old Beast would have found workable analogies in the thoughts of Shankara in that both were concerned with reality and divinity. Such a digression has taken us away from Trump III, but let it be seen that it is difficult to quest without stopping to look into the various doors along the way. If not only the promotion of incommon individuals that is the aim of the Empress; she is also a crucial factor in life itself . Without life coming from life none would exist. Everything in trump III is alive - the Lotus, the Pelican, bird s, and the flowing lines of Lady Harris' brush strokes. The Trump thereby attracts the glance of the Setian vy virtue of its indications of becoming rather than stasis. That coming into being will take the mind to the next card, Trump IV - the Emperor. "},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"Trump IV The Emperor Trump IV is a card flowing with calm and conf ident inner peace and a masculinity which is there without the drive to assert itself. Like Trump III's Empress whose femininity flows from an inner wellspring of its own origin, the man of Trump IV draws on his core self and quite simply is that he can first realize the extent of his abilities and then decise to what uses they will be put. The ordered balance of the card is apparent at even a casual glan ce. It is not only visible, but appealing to the eye perhaps because as the good Mr. Plato says, \"...the ri ght love is to love the orderly and beautiful sobe rly and in the spirit of musi c.\" The Emperor's figure as portrayed by Lady Harris is exactely that: or derly and beautiful. It is an interesting coincidence that both the figures of the Empero r in the Thoth Deck and that of Set in the Temple of Set stele hold ceptres in their right hands and crosses in their left hands. There are of course differences: The Emperor holds a ram- headed sceptre, while Set's has the stylized Set-head. The Emperor's cross-topped orb holds a Maltese Cross while Se t carries the anx. [I suspect the reason for the Maltese Cross could st em from the symbol of the Knights of Malta who formed their crosses from four arrowheads pointed inward. Seen as such, it could be symbolic of temporal influence coming about from an aggressive nature. I do not advance this as dogma, but it does fit with th e red color of the card and overa ll power presented in it.] The ram, Ares, can be seen in four places in thr ee forms: the capitals of the throne [Himalayan wild rams, according to the Book of Thoth ], the sceptre, and the lamb at the Emperor's feet. The presence of the ram and the color red are both suggestive tro Set himSelf - red being Set's color and Ares being the Greek god of war and another corresponding form of the Dark One. The overall message of the card seems to be one of being. It was described some years back as being the master of the Temple card rather than the Emperor and there are indeed more than a few similarities in the Degree and the fi gure within the card. Both the Master and the Emperor have made tremendeous strides towards strengthening the inner universe to a point at which the imposition of the conditions of that universe are far more easily imposed on the objective universe coexisting with it. The \"orderly and beautiful\" direction of Trump IV portrays a soul both content with itself and self-contained. It has learned Euripi des' lesson that it is useless to vex itself at mere things since they care nothing about it , but are simply (and occasiona lly annoyingly) there. Being self-contained it does not humbly accept events and do nothing about them; the Emperor is a soul with a violent past whic h took it first to an uneasines s of the self and then to a disturbance which resulted in the realization of its se parateness from general Nature. The very separateness of that soul's presence teaches it self yet another valuable lesson: all existing things change and do so both quickly and consis tently. It sees, from its unique vantage point, a new nuance of another of Euripides' writings: What has grown from the earth goes back to the earth, but what has sprung from heavenly see d, back to heavenly realms returns. Marcus Aurelius comments that the verse means either a dissolution of intertwining atoms or a similar dispersion of unfeeling elements. The Emperor mi ght view it as saying that the lower base parts of himself must return to the elements which formed it, but the highest and best, the aristos , adheres to that which is working its way toward divini ty. It is that aristos which by virtue of its refinement (or its Indulgence ) which is able to select what is or is not the valuable cargo of the Self."},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"The Emperor also portrays yet another stage, if considered in that sp ecial light, of Magical evolution that all of us encount er at one time or another in ou r quests. Note that the Trump does not display a passive figure. What we see is one which appears to be in waiting or holding itself in readiness. There is out anal ogy: the Emperor has conquered his foes and has gathered about himself the things he sees as beautiful and orderly. He has succeeded in building his universe through change in accord w ith Will. The question facing him is that of what to do with events as he has shaped th em. As the High Priest recently commented, \"And now? What next?\" Those are the questions which all of us dwell upon at one point or another. It is not correct to say we always experience hesitation when contemplating those next steps; the wisdom accumulated by previous experime nts tend to rule out rash and thoughtless actions in favor of cool and calm deliberation. The Emperor is a Trump with symbols of va luable knowledge. An ex amination of it should reveal even further insights and analogies to the Initiate taking the card in hand. Trump V The Hierophant \"It is impossible,\" wrote Magus Crowley in The Book of Thoth of this Trump, \"to explain this card thoroughly, for only the course of events can show how the new current of initiation will work out.\" While I am not gi ven to finding signs, omens, and wonders at every turn, a glimpse at the card raised an eyebrow for me: th e Taurus figure is al so the astrological sign under which I was born and the main figure is po rtrayed as having nine nails [suggestive of the Council of Nine which I have the honor to be Chairman]. DCLXVI also has this to say about the Hierophant: \"The main reference... is... the uniting of the microcosm with the macrocosm.\" This is one of the main duties of a Magus. While there are other touches with a great deal of personal meaning, the reference to deep indigo being a color of Saturn as a Lord of Time [a TimeLord?] also hit rather str ongly. Since Aleister Crowley long predated the continuing tales of my favorite TimeLord, it is out of the question to think he had anything sci-fi in mind with that particular notation. T oo, after my almost disastrous slip of the tongue which would have changed the Summoning of the Elements at the recent Conclave into the Summoning of the Elephants, I cannot but be amused at the seight of the two pachyderms on the card. It was necessary duting the Aeon of HarWer to convey the new trut hs through a number of vehicles, one of which was symbolism. That form of expression should clarify, not make matters more obscure. Trump V is one such ex ample of a card which is a trasure trove of lessons for being; my objection to it is that the symbolism is often confusing when viewing the delicate and detailed ork re quired first to get and then to apply the meanings therein. The Hierophant is present within eac h of us. It may be that he is not as fully awaken in some as in others, but as one whose duty is that of bringing things together, he is indespensable. Crowley erred when setting the appearances of an Aeonic Hierophant or Magus at 2,000 year intervals, but he saw very clearly that the manife stations would always be present. It is sad to see it at times abused and mi sinterpreted, but there it is: ma nkind has complete freedom of Will and therefore must make its own analyses and decisions."},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"There is yet another function which can be as cribed to the Hierophant. Although he bears no weapons himself, standing before him is the wo man girt with the sword, thereby indicating his role as a minister of justice. Just as the Hierophant resides within each of us stimulating and hopefully making clear the relevancies before us, so he also opens the door to a persona examiner. \"I deliver them to the examiners fr om whose guard there is no escape,\" says the Book of Coming Forth by Night , The Hierophant guides, but he also guards since the armed woman before him is not static. The Hierophant is the Manifest or of Mystery. We can do no less than examine and manifest that figure within ourselves with the greatest possible clarity and dedi cation to our eternal quest. Trump VI The Lovers \"This card and its twin, XIV, Art,\" wrote Aleist er Crowley, \"are the mo st obscure and difficult of the Atu.\" The card, like its fellows, is al ive with movement; such action should be, and probably was, meant to help open doors rather than intentionally confuse the observer. And like the others, Trump VI does that very thing - it can lead to a merry jaunt down the road to bewilderment. The Trump is alchemical in nature, although in these days we do not spend our time over furnaces pulling literal gold from literal garbage. The true gold behind the symbolism is the knowledge added to the fund of knowledge alread y present. Crowley's statement on Trump VI is, in its original form, the story of creati on and sheds far more light on the Atu than any number of miscellaneous Book of Thoth notations. I cannot but notice the incipien t Remanifestation factors head ing together - the King and Queen, the Lance and Grail bearers, the Mobius strip in movement around the central figure's arms, and the Orphic Egg, among others. Each figure portrays budding actions which will reach outward to influence the other figues and themselves in the futures they are forging. The Eve, Lilith and Cupid forms are not necessarily st atic even if they appe ar singular and/or in the background. And what would an Atu of Love be without Eros somewhere in the picture. Love being the Law under Will, the winged shaft bearer cannot be omitted from the messages of the Trump. And when you think about it, do we not use Love in our Work, and is our Work possible without Love? Even as a mother-image sh e is not to be ignore d. Her role in creation of self-development is necessary to its contin uity, although the figure of Lilith has in the long run far more power over the other forms within the frame since she represents alluring and often forbidden pleasures. The Trump is an ope n door to pleasure and as Ipsissimus Crowley remarked, \"The subject of this card is Anal ysis, followed by Synthesis. The first question asked by science is: 'How shall we recombine th em to our greater advantage?' This resumes the whole policy of the Tarot.\" How shall we recombine is indeed the question of Trump VI and its answer in part is to be found in the union and Remainfesting of ourselves with Life as perhaps none but Setians can fully appreciate. "},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"Trump VII The Chariot The central point of Trump VII is water, as can be seen held in the Grailcradled by the Charioteer. The Grail seems to have depth beyon d that normally expected and accepted as a vessel. the Water symbol here, DCLXVI tells us , is Binah, the warm and friendly waters of the Understanding of the Magistri Templi. It seems to be in a state of movement (a common link with the other Trumps) and leads inward to ward more advanced states of being. Would I at this point introduce similarities between the va st potentials of what is seemingly contained within the confines of the Grail and the lim itless interior of a TARDIS? Of course not, although it is just as easy to be reminded of C.S. Lewis's Last Battle segment in which Aslan's chosen (his Elect) are transferre d to a more refined state of being and experience the curious sensation of finding their new world larger on th e inside the further in one went. The Grail references in the Crystal Tablet regarding the Order of the Trapezoid are helpful reading along these lines. I question at this point in the Aeon whether the \"four pillars of the Universe, the regimen of Tetragrammaton\" are really all that signifi cant beyond a primitive belief that each elevated thing must have supports somewhere along the lin e. Granted, a roo is likely to fall without walls and other lumbers, but the blue which indi cates Binah in Trump VII had not yet attained the sophistication of today's waters. It all may be academic, but my own concept of what makes a Master of the Temple is a good number of degrees away from what the Grade was back in the Aeon of HarWer - and it is necessary to observe in the pr oper perspective to get better clarity. The \"original energy\" shown by the scarlet wheels will not arouse as much argument as the pillars, although it might be obs erved that the wheels, which should be in motion, are still, as the four sphinx-figures ther e to draw the chariot al ong. Activity is present in the Trump, but it seems to be centered at the Grail and less evidently toward the Knight. It is tempting to reverse the previous paragraph's re mark that the card seems to be in a state of movement, but I will let it stand with the qualifi er that the action leans toward the subtle. There are other figures in this Trump; the com posite sphinx-figures, th e stars on the Knight's armor, the concentric rings moving outward from the Grail, the Crab, the shape on the floor of Binah, and so on. It would be possible to go anothe r two or three pages with this Atu, as with others, but a question presents itself in the form of what is applicable to this Aeon. It would seem at first that the answer would be a brie f one; I suspect that although the reply would not be wordy, it would paint a picture of a calm a nd rational presence meditating on his state of Being on having found and put the Black Flame to use. His presence has made itself known and the effects of theory and dynamics are Re manifesting themselves endlessly in new and previously unsuspected directions. His Will has been to Indulge and he has thereby Xepered and Remanifested a whole which is far more than the sum of the parts. Trump VIII Adjustment Trump VIII, Adjustment, brings to mind an old saying from the Temple's Xem era: There is no justice, everything just is. The theme of balances running throughout Trump VIII is a good picture of why that thought st ruck people as having a good deal of truth about it. Everything in the card is marked by equilibrium, itself ha ving two subcategories: the balance is marked"},{"pageNumber":928,"pageContent":"by either self-knowledge and poise or by a frozen stasis in which the symmetry is brought about by inactivity rather than attainment. The young and slender woman in the card's center is crowned with the plumes of Ma'at, an indication that her poise depends on the truth of the \"now\". It is a great temptation to translate the \"now\" of the card into terms equated with a broad range of time aimed at the collective rather than the individual. While this can have pertinence for the read er looking for hints and suggestive symbols for an organisation, as has be en done within the ranks of the OTO, C/S, and TS over the years, any Tarot divination will be of necessity based to a greater or lesser degree from the subjective and ther efore could be considered indicat ive of its ability to zero in on the individual with a greater ac curacy. In the case of the lady of Adjustment, the moment is not, as Ouspensky put it, seizable, but it is subj ect to control through the Will. It is important to understand the word \"Will\" in the sense of setting in motion events designed to bring about change in order to grasp bette r the concepts of control a nd balance. Ouspensky drew a comparison of the unawakened and humanity in general with a bli nd man who feels paving stones, lanterns, and walls with the stick and be lieves in the reality and truth of only what he touches at the moment. Past objects and impre ssions have passed and disappeared never to return; that which has not as yet been does not exist. Without sight man sees neither forward nor backward because he does not see anything. He has only the instrument of his knowledge - the length of his stick and beyond that is the start of non-existence. \"It is impossible,\" wrote DCLXVI in the Book of Thoth , \"to drop a pin without exciting a corresponding reaction in every Star. The action ha s disturbed the balance of the Universe.\" I would hesitate to carry the comparison that fa r, but see the gist of his remark. Such a comment calls for Magisterial Understanding to be properly comprehended. The reactions on the part of other Initiates result from th e opening of doors with new tools and knowledge behind them. When such pins are dropped ther e are indeed correspond ing reactions. To use Remanifest as an example, the new Word arrived on the scene, made itself known, presented a challenge, and thereby in that case did make a disturbance. I have some doubts that gravity and a pin can exert such influences. The lady of Adjustment is of interest to the order of Leviathan since, as Ipspsspmus Crowley says, \"She represents Manifestation...\" With that in view I can understand the comment. She has, in terms of the Word, Come Into Being a nd Remanifested herself as a new being in each moment as a result of her vigilance, Will, and Balance. [I always felt a problem with the Per- t/Man ifestation thing of some year s back was that it addressed a single event and made no provisions for further development, evolution, or the acquiring of other skills.] The Manifestation of Trump VIII is one of a moment, but is also a step toward continuation. The balance factor is an active one rather than th e result of a frozen stat e and contributes through the symbolism to escaping the pull of the cosm os through helping establish the firm presence of the Self. Trump IX The Hermit The word renunciation has a negative ri ng, and India's frquent use of it has undoubtedly been one of the factors in ear ning for her the reputation of being life- denying and pessimistic.

But renunciation can also be a clearer sign of exhilaration and confidence in life's high calling than any amount of momentary indulgence. When not perverted, religious renunciation is on a continuum with that of the athlete in training who turns his back upon every indulgence that would deflect from his prize. Precisely th e opposite of disillusionment, it is the only evidence that can be given of Life's confidence in the existence of values beyond those it is experiencing at the moment. - Houston Smith The general concept of a hermit is that of renunciation, but as Houston Smith's remarks above show, there is more than one meaning to bot h words. Not everyone necessarily looks at Trump IX and seeing a figure which has hidden itself away from the world, again in the generally accepted sense. There are those pe rceptive enough to see IX's renunciation and solitude as being beneficial to the growth and development of the soul. Although it is academic, how would Aleister crowley dire ct the painting of the Hermit today? Contemplation and metaphysics have undergone ch ange [= Xeper and Remanifest] since the Aeon of HarWer. The Book of Thoth points out that the Hermit is attributed to the letter Yod , itself meaning Hand, that in turn indicating the \"tool or inst rument par excellence... in the center of the picture.\" [Why the hand? I suspec t that portion of the anatomy st ruck DCLXVI as symbolic of the force and working of the Will. He could have (and has) done worse.] It is, to use one of the Book of Thoth's words, a fertile card. Surrounding the central human figure are depictions of life: the green productive grain stalks, the sp erm with its embryonic fi gure, the egg with the yet-to-be surrounded by the watchful serpent, th e Hermit himself absorb ed in concentration, and even the Cerberus/Anubis figure in the card's lower right corner. Ipsissimus Crowley devotes some little space to the lamp of the sun held by the figure and all but describes it as the core symbol of the li ght of the Universe. Once again there are dual interpretations open to the obser ver. There are two universes: th e subjective and the objective. We ourselves build the light in the former and as one train of Buddhist thought says, By ourselves is evil done, By ourselves, we pain endure, By ourselves we cease from wrong. By ourselves we become pure. No one saves us but ourselves, No one can and no one may; We ourselves must tread the Path: Buddhas only show the way. While the Temple of Set is not Buddhist, it doe s make use of viable concepts and the verse above is just that: it spotlights th e singularity of the Self and wh en combined with the force of the Black Flame, the singularity becomes the light of the universe/reality which is made firm by the combination. There is a not quite so friendly version of this light, if we wish to draw from one Magician's past Working and do not mind the symbolism in volved. Aleister Crowley himself speaks in terms of the light of the universe, the fluidic es sence of Light, and the life of the universe. The majority of people have heard of the great t unnels of light experienced by those who have undergone near death experiences (NDE) or at a minimum have seen the little psychic in"},{"pageNumber":930,"pageContent":"Poltergeist urging the departed to \"pass into th e Light\". [She might be a pleasant enough person in real life, but her character was a thoroughly obnoxious one!] The theory of that Initiate, whose Magical Diary is extant, is that th e light is the sensed a nd visual (to the mind's eye) representation of cosmic energy, mindless an d mechanical, as the Di abolicon paints it. if such is indeed the case, I woul d be rather reluctant to pass in to the Light [to be assimilated into the cosmos] and would opt instead for the tr easures stored within the velvet darkness. The Master of the Temple examining Trump IX will see an aspect of himself in the figure of the Hermit. The form depicted is not only al one despite the surrounding objects, he is also absorbed in contemplation and experiencing th e Magisterial quality of Understanding. That characteristic cannot be explained to those who have not expe rienced it and an analysis of it is unnecessary for those who possess it. Pure U nderstanding can in its way be a far more pleasurable pursuit even than dyna mics since it feeds the highest levels of the soul with knowledge untinged by corruptions from the outside world. As tempting as the purely contemplative life can be, it leaves the being in complete without the te sting procedures we use to try each alleged truth. Working in such a laboratory is one of the methods the Master of the Temple uses in his principal business, it self defined by Ipsissimus as the tending of the garden and the obtaining of a perfect understand ing of the Universe. Th e Setian IV° will read and understand this. Contemplation is not sole ly the prerogative of the Fourth Degree, however. The First, Second, and Third Degree Setia n Initiate also indulges in mysticism, although to a less precise depth. Re aders who have not attained Ma stery need not despair; one Works to do one's best, not to reach for prestige in attempt to impress others. Trump X Fortune Ipsissimus Crowley, in the Book of Thoth , identifies Trump X with Jupiter, the astrological Greater Fortune. \"It would be narrow,\" wr ote the Beast, \"to th ink of Jupiter as good fortune; he represents the element of luck. The incalc ulable factor.\" In c onjunction with the three figures riding th wheel, that inca lculable brings to the front a component of Initiatory progress and Will which we tend at times to overlook. A brief study of the three central figures of the Trump would be in order before looking at the influence of tje incalculable. The Book of Thoth explains them this way: On this wheel are three figures, the Sw orded Sphinx, Hermanubis, and Typhon; they symbolize the three forms of energy which govern the movement of phenomena. A symbol is a representation, an attempt to make concrete the abstract in order that the mind may more easily grasp and use the intangible. Ma gus Lewis casteth a wary eye about when he hears or reads of symbolism for, like Hust on Smith [Professor of Philosophy, M.I.T. and author of The Religions of Man ], he has seen the symbolism go out of control and land in the realm of mysticism, itself described by Smith as \"beginning in 'mist', centering in 'I', and ending in 'schism'.\" Symbolism, like mysticism, is a powerful tool when used with a clear head and both feet firmly on the ground. Endeavour in your Initiatory proc ess to utilize them is in just such ways. Ipsissimu s Crowley notes in that vein th at the three figures are qualities and as such require careful interpretation. He continues with a discussion of the Hindu system of categorizing and describing these qualities in a way which shows his creative brilliance."},{"pageNumber":931,"pageContent":"The basic point of his clarification is that ther e is an upward path available if one so chooses. The old Temple of Set stele also incorporates this same messa ge and it is as valid in XII AES as it was in I AEH. In connection with this upward movement of the being and the push which gives it momentum, Priest Roger Whitaker's article on \"Occult Power\" should be read. And there is Man, on his way up the physical and intellectual ladder to a new state of being unlike any he has experienced before, full of knowledge and understanding and a willingness to explore the dark corners of the unknown as he heads for a new beginning. As high as his head is in the clouds, I have said before that his feet must be firmly planted on the ground at the same time and the reason fo r that little piece of advice is the theme of Trump X. We speak of fortune smiling on this or that person or as frowning on another and thereby translate an observed or reported se ries of incidents into an unde rstandable format, or at least one more comfortably dealt with. The Magus who wrote the Book of Thoth was capable of determining the underlying element in fortune, but did not have such grap hic depictions of it as we are able to read and watch today via the electronic medium. Here is the most important part of dealing with fortune: it is random and as such is capable of bringing about the most unexpected of changes. Great evil or great good [both completely subjective] can be overthrown only by an even greater evil or good or by accident. As the Trail has recommended in the past, take a look at Star Wars , The Wizard of Oz , the Return to Oz , or any number of cinematic magics in which the elem ent of chance or acciden t leads to changes far greater than the unexpected happening. Having both feet on the ground is helpful when those random accidents take place. Too many magician s over the years have not only constructed cloud castles, but moved into them as well with the predictabl e result of crashing miserably when fortune introduced a new and random element. Trump X has more meanings within its frame th an the three figures alone, but I suspect the forepart is that which would more immediatel y concern and interest the Setian reader. Be prepared for the unexpected: great forces are generated through the theory and dynamics of Magic and who can say what will suddenly appear or in which way it will Remanifest itself? Trump XI Lust Now ye shall know that the chosen priest and apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woma n all power is given. They shall gather my children into their fold; they shall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men. P> Formerly called Strength, as the old Ipsiss imus wrote, Trump XI is far more than the generally accepted meanings of the world. As is usual with DCLXVI's manner of expanding things, he could not resist th e urge to cloud somewhat the su bject by introducing the Life Tree's Geburah , Chesed , and other branch influences. Un less readers have a passion for the complicated and easily misleading, the Life Tree references are relativel y useless and it would be far more profitable to go in to the heart of the matter by re flecting on the Word of the Aeon of HarWer and the composition of Trump XI. Atu XI is a statement of confident power drawn from the brightly burning fires of the magical current of that day. The colors aree bold and the li nes vivid - in this they contrast even further with the background of trodden-on pallid saints and other symbols of a dead past. This quote"},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"from the Book of Thoth , when viewed with an eye on Ae onic relevance, is a good indication of the dynamo functioning at that time. She rides astride the Beast; in her left hand she holds the reins, representing the passion which unites them. In her right she holds aloft the cup, the Holy Grail aflame with love and death. In this cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the Aeon. The Book of Lies devotes one chapter to this symbol. Passion would be perhaps the bwest of words to describe Atu XI. It was a time of freedom from the domination of the lying spectre and the discovery of Will, itself the charting of one's own course through the stars. This may be one of the reasons Crowley wrote that the name on the card implied far more than is usually asso ciated with strength. The Word of the Aeon was not understood, needless to say, as well as we of this Aeon compre hend it and yet the many avenues of the possible opened by by its Uttering were wellsprings of doing what one Willed. This is best seen in the figure of the Wo man in the Trump. She is golden in color and therefore quite possibly an indi cation of thr highest and finest, symbol-wise. Just as gold remains one of the most sought after of metals, so the golden woman was the most precious of beings... one who did as she Willed with no restrict ions in the form of the shall and shall not. The Beast is also of gold and therefore much to be desired. The reins, the \"passion which unites them\", was of a special significance to Crowley; this becomes obvious when recalling his obsession with having a Scarlet Woman av ailable for Magic(k). Without the presence of the reins there was a risk of the loss of balance and sights se t on the Path of the Aeon, hence the tie. The Beast's seven heads are a composite of Ipsi ssimus Aleister Crowley himself: \"The head of an Angel: the head of a Sain t: the head of a Poet: the head of an Adulterous Woman: the head of a Man of Valour: the head of a Satyr: the head of a Lion-Serpent.\" The divine drunkenness described in the Book of Thoth also says a great deal about Atu XI. It is once again described as an indication of th e power available for ta pping as desired and when you think about it, which of us has at one time or another not experienced an intoxication when partaking of the Magic of our Aeon? Like Dr . Faustus, Ipsissimus Crowley urged his Initiates to \"Fear not ... but to resulote, and try the uttermost magic can perform.\" The quote is a good piece of advice when contempl ating Strength and the tr ue Lust: to try the uttermost and experience one's own composite self is to drink of the fires of the Aeon, regardless of the one in which the one partakin g lives. The goal behind entering such fires is of course the gathering of wisd om; considering the central figure in Trump XI, it is not too far out of kine to keep also in mind this from Thus Spoke Zarathustra : \"Unconcerned, mocking, violent - thus wisdom wants us: she is a woma n and always loves only a warrior.\" The warrior and the woman are never far apart in this card. The presence of the Grail held aloft by the Woman is significant as a point of emphasis insofar as Understood by Aleister Crowley in his day. The Grail is still a part of magic to this day and Workings of the Order of the Trapezoid are oriented toward the contemporary import of both the container and its contents. There is no single Grail, but rath er one constructed and purified by each Initiate for his own use a nd with its own singular meaning. DCLXVI's 1944ce comment on the Holy Grail aflame with love and death and holding the mingled sacraments of the Aeon seems to bear this out. "},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"Trump XII The Hanged Man \"This card,\" writes Aleister Crowley, \"is beautiful in a strange, immemorial, moribund manner. It is the card of the Dy ing God; its importance in the pr esent pack is merely that of Cenotaph (1) .\" It says: \"If ever things get bad like that again, in the new Dark Ages which appear to threaten, this is the way to put things right.\" But if things have to be put right, it shows they are very wrong. It should be the chie fest aim of the wise to rid mankind of the very insolence of self-sacrifice, of the calamity of chastity; faith must be slain by certainty; and chastity by ecstacy.\" He goes on to quote Liber Legis \"pity not the fallen\" passage and generally places a great deal of emphasis on the Dying God/sacrificial aspe cts of Atu XII. Seen from what was the contemporary Magical thought of this time, Crowley's talk of oblati on in the form of ritual in order to exorcise the stagnant influences of the prior Aeon are not all out of line. His frustration with the hypocrisy of the Plymouth Br ethren contributed no small part to the later determination to squash the lying spectre. a pa rt of the task carried out by Crowley with a pleasurable venegance. Added to this tool os his underlying and unspoken thought that the sacrificial Dying God is not rea lly particularly superior to ma n - he, the Dying God, could be manipulated and made to serve the purposes of man the magician through the release of those qualities peculiar to him and theref ore not necessarily being in a pos ition to decide the fate of man. Crowley possibly considered this as a face t of every man and every woman being a star. Such an attitude is integral to an understanding of Thelema. If examined in the light of Aeonic progre ssion, Atu XII displaying a fogure of the Aeon previous to that of the Osirian, that of Isis , the Hanged Man is logically enough an expression of man headed in the direction of the Mother, herself the great Water from which life came. It may have some possible value as an interpre tation of the practically boundless sea of Binah from which the Master of the Temple draws hi s Understanding. In this day and age such an interpretation is simple enough to unders tand, but beyond PR it has little significance. However, the \"Let not the waters whereon t hou journeyest wet thee. And, being come to shore, plant thou the Vine and rejoice without shame\" quote is a fair enough rendering of one of the pleasures of the Magistri at home in the blue sea of Binah. Somewhat similar to Trump IV, the Emperor, Tr ump XII displays another side of the male coin. Whereas the Emperor sits in alert contro l and dignity, the central figure of the Hanged Man is suspended in meditation and alert to ma tters other than those immediately apparent. Granted, the position itself is le ss than could be wished for, but the attention of the hanged figure is on subjects impacting on a subjective level far deeper than the goings of daily life. 1 cenotaph: an empty memorial tomb, the body of the honored being buried elsewhere Trump XIII Death Trump XIII is not a sign of death as that stat e is generally understood. It is a depiction of change and Magic and few other Trumps are more appropriate to the Co nclave edition of the Trail of the Serpent than XIII. The integral indegrient in Thelema, Indulgence, Xeper, poor"},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"old Xem, and Remanifest is that change with forms rungs on the ascending ladder of evolution from the human running on automatic to the divine god who creates as he Wills. I cannot help seeing Trump XIII as a card with si gn after sign of the Remanifestation process. Although the Book of Thoth refers to the actions of putrefac tion as an element of change, but interestingly enough the card shows no green. That color, you may recall from other TS texts, was associated with Osiris as a god of the stat ic dead and suggested a worship of the body's decay rather than emphasis on a life lived through opposition to the rules of the universe. Instead of dealing with green, DCLXVI clooses to work upward using the three sections of the card. The first, the scorpion, is described as the lowest form of putrefaction, based on the old superstition that the scorpion stin gs itself to death when ringed about with fire. The heart of that story as seen by Aeister Cr owley is associated with will ing change when circumstances become intolerable. I must add that for Magici ans, if no others, circumstances without change do become intolerable and that change is sought not only to in crease the Xeper of the being, but to avoid being locked in stasis. It may be for that reason that the old Beast referred to the scorpion's sting as the lowest form since in a se nse it is done not necessari ly with specifics in mind, but as a lower reasoning which seeks to escape that which is. Such an interpretation of course does not cover all that th e scorpion is for the Magician, but it is worthwhile looking at in Atu XIII. \"The middle interpretation of this sign,\" the Book of Thoth continues, \"is given by the serpent, who is, moreover, the main theme of the sign.\" The passage continues by pointing out that its manner of propulsion are like the tw in phases of life which are cal led life and death and then repeats that the serpent is the principal sym bol of male energy. It is definetely a phallic symbol and as such stands for the creative e ffect of active energy on the passive, sperm and egg being one of the best representations of su ch energy's impact and results. The serpent has had a place of long standing in o ccult tradition and it is not inappr opriate that it should turn up as one of the suspect its presence, like that of the scorpion and the eag le, to be similar in function to the three figures on the old Temple of Set stele from the year X with its three ascending forms of being rising ever upward on the evolutionary scale. The eagle, according to the old Beast, is exalta tion above solid matter and is the highest of the card. It may be an eagle, but the outlines and sh ape are not at all unlik e those of the phoenix, the great presence born from fire. If seen as such, the theme of the card has far greater meaning than would have been read from the eag le as the third form of putrefaction alone. The most prominent form in Trump XIII is th at of the dancing skel eton with irs sweeping scythe. In a contemporary sense I do not think the Osirian crown necessarily appropriate to a symbol placed there to indicate active change, although to be fair about it one must recall DCLXVI's incurable love of taking the intric ate into the land of overkill. If we view the skeleton as one of the dead only, an Osirian accouterment is acceptable; the dancer is anything but that, however. His movements are magical ones designed to create an environment from which change in accord with the Will can be accomplished. It appears to be an evocative series of moves made in order to set in motion the forces necessary to the bringing forth of life. This seems evidenced by the figures taking from in the upward spirals emanating from the pelvic area of the skel eton. The angular DNA-like lines moving up within the spirals are highly suggestive of life forming itself into those forces which will end as basic living beings. Aleister Crowley's firm belief in male supremacy also surfaces in the"},{"pageNumber":935,"pageContent":"symbolism of life force forming from the pha llus projecting from the skeleton. The male's place in the scheme of life creation is not to be discounted and while DCLXVI did explore and attempt to place the female in a role of he r own, he never was quite able to rise above the idea of both genders having certain roles to follow, whereas today's Temple assigns no functions based on gender, but looks at Initiatory development instead. Each of us does his own dance of life and change , albeit not as graphic as that portrayed in Trump XIII. Wr create, delete, augment, and whether our attainments are those of Black Magical expertise or going furthe r to the point of Garden tending, we are free to utilize those tools available within the halls of the Temple and further expand in or der to find other tools awaitening the Magical cratfsman's hand. Trump XIV Art Crowley relates Atu XIV to the sixth of that series, the Lovers. One look at the card will explain a part of his reasoning. But why the eight Trumps between them? The answer may lie in the fact that that the Atus are not desi gned as random croppings up; rather, they are sequential in natu re. The original Trail of the Serpent series did not follow that order strictly since it began not with Atu 0, but with Trump I. When the series started it seemed correct to place the Ipsissimus card at the end [or top]; Alei ster Crowley's placement of the Universe is proper to the cycling of the development the Trumps portray Being a procession, the Trumps tell a story. The procession going from Atu VI to XIV is as follows. The Lovers (VI) represent integrations of opposing effects which Remanifest as something more than the whole of the parts which made it. The Chariot (VII) then forms a place unique unto the newly made and developing being, a place self-o rdered wherein Magical resear ch and development can go on. A sense of balance and Adjustment (VIII) come s about through this wor k. If, as the deck's author suggested, the female figure of VIII is Ka rma in Eastern philosophy, then that facet of evolution is a representation of the awareness of consequences which may come about from the being's acts. A working appreciation of this goes up a step to the generative wisdom and light of the Hermit (IX). This stage does not indicate the commonly accepted view of one hiding away from the world. In the place of flee ing from the world, the Hermit is one of the few in civilization carrying a lamp to dispel the darkness of ignorance. His actions spur constant change in the universe, the Fortune (X ) with which he and others must contend in moving forward. Mastery of this promotes a stre ngth, a Lust (XI) to do, see. and find more by using the power being accumulated and used bot h within and without. The strength developed by the product of Atu VI is splendid and glor ious. It tames the beasts and holds aloft the chalice of essence. Should a a new Dark Age aris e, as DCLXVI advises his readers, deal with it promptly. The strength of Lust (XI) is sufficient to do just that by the example of the hanged Man (XII). XII is not merely a th reat; it is also a mystical glimpse back into prehistory for the Adept Magician who understands his ties with water. Understandi ng all to date, the metaphysician which the Lovers' product has b ecome has a discerning eye for change and knows Death (XIII) in its greater and lesser aspect s.

Art (XIV) Comes Into Being through a combination of all these. The work in progress in Atu XIV is one designe d to bring about greate r change enhanced by a thorough understanding of the prin ciples and techniques involved to date. It is, as Aleister Crowley says, the spiritualization of the result of the Great Work. In former Temple of Set days we heard this spoken of as being \"alXemi cal\" in nature. In the sense that I Understand Xem this may certainly be true. Such a tr ansformation of the contradictory into an aristos would tend to open the gate to eternal and open-ended goals, themselves keys to an immortality beyond any that coul d have been dreamed of. Trump XV The Devil Very few indeed would be the number of Magici ans who have not lingered over Atu XV. It is not representative of the essen ce of pure malignant evil, but rather an exploration of the presence and actions of a being known and re garded in various light s throughout history. The majority of religions have a beli ef in at least one de ity and an afterlife of some sort as the integral parts of their foundation and attraction. Not all, however, have that in common: writer Patrick H. Nowell-Smith points out that Buddhi sm, for example, contains neiter a perspnal god nor a personal immortality. He goes further to say that there are at least three essential indegrients in most religions - (a) a belief in the powers and presence of the supernatural [either as persons or forces]; (b) proper emoti onal attitudes [a sense of the sacred or unusual and an attitude of humility or reverence in c onnection with the religi on]; and (c) rituals, ceremonial observances, and other religious responsibilities [designed to interact favorably with the presence(s) involved]. In philosophies following these a, b, and c requirements there is invariably a spirit which opposes progress along the desire d path. Tjose religions which have deteriorated to a state of mere lip service find their devils necessary to the fragments of faith remaining to them. There otherwise would be no reason for believing in striving and the entire comfortable structure would become appa rent as a framework of fantasy designed to lock out greather truths. The goat depicted in the card's center hearkens back to the association of Satan with that animal. It never seemed particularily appropria te, but there is no accounting for the variety of symbolic assignment by the human mind. The goat of Khar found its way into the Pentagram of the Church of Satan, a \"curious corrupti on\" permitted by Set since it was done with due reverence for the Prince as viewed through the eyes of his representative on Earth. The relevance of the goat as a symbol of Set is a distorted one. The goat's horns and the brush-like ears of the Lord of the Aeon can have a link, as can the admittedly somewhat vague likeness of the frontal part of the goat's head with the el ongated and curved face of Set. It is a distant connection, but one that is not impossible, given the thousan ds of years involved in the relationship of the mind with a Something El se. The philosopher Heid egger taught that the fundamental question of metaphysics id that of w hy there is something inst ead of nothing; it is as applicable to the presence of the goat in Atu XV. But is there a real reason for a goat's presence beyond something residing in the at times perverse mind of Aleister Crowley? DCLXVI sees the card as a visual portrayal of Pan Pangenetor, that which brings all into being. As the source of the Black Flame this assi gnment is not at all far from the mark. Life flows throughout its dimensions in the form of the Tree of Life, the li ving goat with its third"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"all-seeing eye, the twin globes containing soul s awaitening manifestation, the Wand of the Chief Adept, and the erect phallic form exte nding from the base to crown.

As complex as the geometric figures are, the underly ing principle of life is a simple one, as all basics should be. As Dr. Aquino once wrote of the Fourth, Fifth a nd Sixth Degrees, they temselves are not mysterious. It is the capable and successful performance of the Grades that becomes difficult. So it is with Atu XV. Th e emblematic presentation of that integral phenomenon of life is itself stra ightforward for all the sums of life seen. Where things become exacting is in the practice of not just taking up space, but actua lly living in the true sense of the word, and then making use of that quality to create a new day. It should not, in the words of the third Earl Russell, have \"a n air of hocus-pocus about it.\" True, October has come and gone once again, but the impact and message og the Daemon need not be put aside until next y ear. It is one the Xepering being utilizes each day as he firsz creates the new and then Remanifests within the new environment created by Coming Into Being. Trump XVI The Tower There was a move, once upon a time in our history, to relate Trump numbers to the Years of the Aeon. It was understandable th en that I felt a momentary touch of trepidation when someone pointed out that my Fourth Degr ee Recognition took place duting the Year XVI. \"And,\" I was informed, \"under the influence of the Tower.\" But you and I know that the wise man is not steered by the stars, but sets in mo tion his own course and destiny, so I thought no more about it with a little amusem ent at the ominous reference. The Tower stands out in its art from all other Trump cards in its angularity and the violent movement portrayed within its borders. Al eister Crowley descri bes its most basic interpretation as referring to the manifestation of cosmic energy in the grossest form. In such a category it cannot fail to be destructive to a multitude of the more complex artifacts, whether material or abstract. The card shows this very thing taking place as the erected structure is struck by the bolt descending in a sh arp and angled path to ward the earth and not content with taking the fortress with it, is awakening the dest ruction nature is capable of inflicting from the depths of the earth in th e process. The man-like crystalline figures are hurled from the heights of supposed safety by the fire's power to be dashed to pieces on the troubled ground below. [There is hope for them in Atu XVII.] The Tower is also a definits phallic symbol and shown in Atu XVI post the moment of climax, already discharging its fertile and creative elements to take r oot in the Garden of the Magistri. The all-seeing eye in the card's top center does not strike me as very relevant to today's Magical trends. DCLXVI saw it bo th as the Eye of Horus and the Eye of Shiva and goes on in the Book of Thoth to relate the Indian doc trine of Shiva the Destroyer. Such teachings could have an actual releva nce only during the Aeon of HarWer, if even then. Little about it suggests itself to the Aeon of Set."},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"Viewing the card as representative of the overthr ow of the old Aeon of Osiris by the Aeon of Harwer is probably a more accurate interpretation. It would not have the same appropriateness if applied to the move from the latter Aeon to that of Set because of the 180° opposition of Set and Osiris. The Task the Magus Aleister Crow ley faced was that of building a complex new world on the ruins of the old one which had worshipped death for far too long. The HarWer Aeon put in motion the ttrend toward life, hen ce the lack of any nece ssity to destroy. The presence of the figures of the dove and the serp ent are, as DCLXVI's commentary points out, references to Chapter 1, Verse 57 of the Book of the Law . What would history be like had Aleister Crowley chosen the dove instead of th e serpent? The question makes for interesting speculation. His alleged sexual es capades are infamous to this day and were of course a preference on his part prior to the transmission of the Book of the Law . The dove had no chance - the serpent was already firmly establis hed in the mind and Will of HarWer's (9)=[2]. The dove and serpent seem to have only minimal influence when compared to an overall view of the Path we follow today. Minimal in that se nse, but still potent enough in their own right when used actively and with understanding. The dove and serpent representations, along with the Eye, stand out in yet another sense. The three are related in that they belong to a world other than that one constructed by man. The right and left figures are princi ples of the purity of love and the use of it for personal gain. The eye itself is also a higher principle, that of the universe which exists beyond that normally perceived by the lesser senses. The Book of Thoth commentary relates it to the eye of Trump XV, although I disagree with that due to the destru ctiveness of it in Trum p XVI. This is not an act of the Prince we know. But again, it is im portant to remember that The Tower portrays magical and philosophical states as they were in the Aeo of HarWer, not in that of Set. The violence engendered by the Eye is appropriate only in that context of bath ing the worls in fire to prepare it for the then-current Aeon. As pr eviously mentioned, Aleister Crowley loved sex and used it for any and all reasons. Hence his lo ve of the serpent as a means to an end tool rather than refining his methods for the aris tos which the dove might have brought him, He was a blatant and childish chauvinist wher e women were concerned, seeing them only as vessels for pleasure and the bringing about of de sired ends both magical and mundane. If his sex magic had worked even a fair percentage of the time I would be wil ling to grant that he might have been on the trail of something vali d. As it was he only con centrated a number of undesirable diseases and a loss of appreci ation of the finer aspects of love. A last thought on The Tower. How pervasive the laws of Coming Into Being are. The crystalline figures have constr ucted their citadel and brought a bout states of being which for them are doors assisting an evolution into othe r states which themselves may or may not be desirable. The progressive current of the world wa s then taken to a point at which all that had taken place before it had no choice but to Remanife st itself in the new Aeon of Harwer. There is a lesson in all that. It is not possible to foresee the future, but perhaps none of us should find ourselves unduly surprised or shocked when a ll we have been to date suddenly blossoms in strange and unexpected ways. Trump XVII The Star As its name says, Atu XVII abounds with starry obj ects, all as beautiful in form as the hight sky. Nuit is assigned as \"Our Lady of the St ars\" by DCLXVI, a not inappropriate title"},{"pageNumber":939,"pageContent":"considering her association with darkness. Nor is the remark about manifestation out of order. There must be manifestation be fore the individual can Remanife st and this Nuit is doing. The dual cups which Aleister crowley point s out as resembling breasts [due to the Liber Legis reference] hold representations of the most hi ghly refined essences of the Words of the Aeon. The upper chalice holds \"ethereal water, which is also milk and oil and blood,\" themselves components of the feminine nature raised a bove the normal uses into new and advanced function. Note that the flow of the cup's c ontents go no further than Nuit's body and are absorbed rather than permitted to waste on the ground. The lower container on the other hand \"pours the immortal liquor of her life... she pours it upon the junction of land and water.\" DCLXVI made mention in a previous chapter to the cult of Shiva with its doctrine of Nothingnes and gives the suicidal advice of annihilating the refe rences to the Self, thereby removing the boundaries by which the individual ex ists. Refer to Dr. Aquino's analysis and commentary of the Book of the Law for further discussions of Ipsissimus Crowley's recommendations as opposed to his actual prac tices. Here we have a paradox from Aleister Crowley's inkwell: if previously he viewed all manifestations as stains to be avoided, Nuit's own manifestation through the ut ilization of pure essences woul d hardly be desirable, but there we have it - the old Beast was given at time s to assigning right and just as those qualities seemed appropriate at the moment. The contents of both cups are separated by Nu it's swirling hair, a part of the Atu which Ipsissimus Crowley describes as hiding the A byss between the Sea of Binah and the earth, both earth and water being feminine in nature in accord with the gene ral theme of the card, that of the personification of magic in the female aspect. The Abyss itself can be interpreted in a number of ways, each being proper to the Init iate approaching it - ir having crossed it. Trump XVII abounds with movement and energy - the principal parts are moving in swirls and flowings. To me it is a display of Work aime d in the direction of the move to Remanifest. Each movement is made with pur pose in order to enhance the Coming Into Being of that far above the natural. Theroses them selves are seen by Aleister Crowley as representative of Woman, although being free of the soil, they may al so be seen as the result of Garden-tending on the part of the Magistri who work not that th eir charges may remain rooted to the spot, but grow and bloom into new and unusual objects. The upper and lower cups are manipulated in concert that they also may produce the new. The crystals spiral into larger forms, and the starry objects are constantly moving. Atu XVII can be summed up in this quote from the Book of the Law: \"I give unimaginable joys on earth: certaint y, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.\" Trump XVIII The Moon Although somber and forbidding at first glance, Atu XVIII is a card conveying great potential for the seeker who has attained the competence to have gotten to it on an equivalent Initiatory path. \"This,\" wrote Alei ster Crowley in the Book of Thoth , \" is the treshold of life; this is the treshold of death.\" For all the ominous tone of the card it is one of change, much in the way Atu XIII indicates alterations. Atu XVIII is a far more profound representation of"},{"pageNumber":940,"pageContent":"transformation than Atu XIII in th at it has to do with what is accurately referred to the Dark Night of the Soul. As the Gateway of resurrection Atu XVIII is sin gularily pointed in its message of passing the bounds of previously known existe nce into a new and uncharted land where the only rules that apply are those of the self. The Anubis guardians of the twin towers face left and right to ensure than none but those who prove themselves worthy enter and traverse the lane leading to infinity. In hand is to be found tcham ceptre and anx , symbols of the authority of the seekers' individual leading principles and the life which those obsessions can accord. The twon jackals at the bottom of each tower have a violent nature according to Ipsissimus Crowley since according to him they are there to lay in wait for the corpses of those unworthy to pass the gates and who are slain in the atte mpt. Is there truly a transmutation process hidden within the jackal? Some years ago we were taught there was. The question for the unfortunates who do not make it past the towers could be of minor acad emic interest only. The guardians cannot harm one whose self is st rong to the point of making him invulnerable. It is not so much the guardians who interest the viewer of Atu XV III as it is the landscape beyond the walls and extending some distance down from the towers. Aleister crowley quotes Keats' \"There is a budding morrow in midnight\" line to describe the potential at hand in this card. The Xepera beetle may be sunken an near death in appearance, but he carries the new sun upward through the center path between the Gates in order to illumine the new world. Objects beyond the wall are in all probability from Ipsissimus Crowley's impression of his own Self; it would after all be like him to portray a circuitous and twisting path in the new land when it could just as easily have been a straightforward roadway. Again I find myself exasperated at the old Beast's love of the obs cure. The budding morrow is dawning in the land beyond the Gates and is there to warm and shed light on the endeavors the occupant of the new land Wills into being. He can in this land in crease his abilities to the infinite. Given the sophistication of a soul capable of successfully passing the guardians, it is somewhat doubtful that he can Come Into Being a ny further that he already has. Set-like, he will be bounded in and of himself. Fully aware of the cosmos and th e obedience of it to his Will, he will function in ways beyond those he previous ly perceived as an ultimate. It is typical of Ipsissimus Cr owley that he would on the one hand paint a lurid picture of gloom and death and then a few paragraphs la ter go on to revel in th e splendor of cutting a new swath through the jungle. The parts going in to the nine impure drops from the mountain cleft and the other talk of femi nine uncleanliness is Aleister Crowley being Aleister Crowley with his opinion of women coming through onc e again. Beyond the chauvinism of the man, his insights into the duality of approaches to the Gates are very to the point. Changes occur in the perception of the Initiate which causes him to undergo a Remainfestation unlike those before and which make him go so far as to at least momentarily question his right to the Path his feet have followed. Until he has analyzed and correctly assessed the new situation his world will be shadowy with the unknown. Once be yond the Gates he is very like the later description DCLXVI paints: \"How splendid is this adventure!\" And the adventure is splendid, I might add. Fr om a personal standpoint the adventure of acquiring the knowledge of Set ha s been splendid and one that no other sequence of events spanning the years until now could have eclipsed. There are Dark Nights of the Soul, but there are also the magnificent dawnings filled with ma gic and Work for Work's sake. It is for that that we chart courses which may one day take us to the land of the aristos ."},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":" Trump XIX The Sun The Magus Aleister Crowley was motivated by the thorough conviction of a great and personal Task, that of pioneering the new Ae on of HarWer. His Vision permitted viewing the impact and potential of Magical and philosophic al trends in a way unparalleled in his day and it is due to that fire of inspiration that we in part owe the advanced st ates of our own Magic. The expression of that indwelling fire took many forms other than the Thoth Tarot deck, but the combination of that force and the brus h strokes of Lady Harris are among the most beautiful. In the case of Atu XIX, the principles of the new Aeon can be seen in their brightest and most joyous. The radiance of The Sun is unequalled in the Trump. The fiery central form sends its rays out to a world already far advanced fr om the biological soup of its beginnings. The world's population has identified correlations be tween the random placements of the stars and attempted to perform Magic through the meanings which might be found in the constellations. The sun of the Aeon of HarWer illuminated th e starry shapes and produced new and more appropriate interpretations. Astrology played its own part in Aleister Cr owley's approach to life, but Magus LaVey's impression of \"God in sports clothes\" is a more accurate description of the general subject. While astrology can be a powerful tool in the practic e of Magic, it is an implement rather than an active force unto itself. The Adept Magician knows this fact and takes it into account. The wall-encircled mountain of green behind the dancing figures can be seen in one sense as Initiatory acheivement as well as the fertile Ea rth itself. It rises from the depths below the rainbow oval almost to touch the brilliant sun abov e. There is a similarity in the scaling og the mountain and Initiatory progress: the quest starts on a certain level and goes upward to the heights of understanding and clar ity, as can be seen in the unnatural sequence from the First to the Sixth Degrees. The two dancing figures, according to DCLXVI , represent the young and shameless male and female inhabitants of the Earth. The two have sh own themselves in other Trumps, but in this Atu they frolic free of restraint and duties in the new world their tasks have produced, a world free of Restriction. They portray a \"next stage\" of human evolution emerging from the old rose and cross symbols at their feet, shell-like, no longer necessary to their current state. Why a wall on a mountain? If the similarities of the ascending grade and Degrees are even remotely valid, things become more difficult through being increasingly exacting as the quest is extended. The system of the Temple of Se t has those Degrees which can be attained on one's own and those which require the interventi on of Set himSelf to bring into being. The wall has a special meaning for the Setian IV° w ho has been ordained by Set and then Xepered by his efforts into the Grade of the Master of the Temple. He will leave made the step into a state of such mastery that his comprehensi on os the Will of Set could not have been previously suspected or anticipated. In other wo rds, he has crosses the wall of the Initiatory mountain."},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"Each Atu carries its own message . In the case of Trump XIX the basic one is that of freedom and an appreciation of the boundless possibilities of Magic. It is an opportunity to escape from the tiresome and tough prejudices discussed in the Book of Thoth . Trump XX The Aeon \"I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; th e wand of the Force of Coph Nia; but my left hand remains empty, for I have crushed an Un iverse; & nought remains.\" With these words from the Book of the Law Atu XX can be viewed as an explor ation into the nature of the Lord of the Aeon as applicable through Ip sissimus Crowley's Understanding. Previously known as The Last Judgement or The Angel, Atu XX is more properly a representation of the Aeon of harWer as seen through the eyes of that god's Magus. The older representations depicted graves opening along with other nuances of death worship. The newer Croeley/Harris card ignores the Osirian slant and focuses instead on the possibility of life in an Aeon established in the then-present rather than any remote celestial realm. The red background represents the unique pr esence of life and the baptism of fire which gave birth to the Aeon of HarWer. The arched body of Nuit protects both the emerging Initiate and the god in his sanctum indicating thereby the origin of the deity and his power. DCLXVI describes Nuit as a category of unlimited possibility, but su ch a view is accurate only in the context of the Magical approaches of that day. The actual night sky, whic h Setians find so stimulating, has far more meaning both realized and intuited than the visualization of an arched goddess. \"About 2,000 years\" is the amount of time Ipsissimu s Crowley estimated as the lifespan of his Aeon until the rise of the next. The double-wanded one did appear, but in much less time than anticipated. The Aeon of HarWer gave way to the Age of Satan, a bridging decade to the Aeon of Set. 2,000 years somewhat overshot the mark, but the old Beast can be forgiven much since he was unable to see beyond his ow n Word. To be sure, a certain amount of his time projection was conceit, but his ability to forsee the future lacked detailed precision. An Aeon is by definition an indefinite period of time. That of HarWer lasted 62 years, the Age of Satan only ten. No one can say what length the current Aeon will la st - it is just not possible for any of us to foresee the future with an accuracy that great. What is possible is an analysis of past and contemporary events with a resulting set of most probable circumstances. The presence of random accident or deliberate acts by those within the ongoing time cycles adds to the difficulty od detailing the future . I once had an employer who, when things got rough and wild on the job, would remark in a maddeningly calm way for us to \"do the best you can\"; it took a number of years to see the wisdom in her words. That is the task of those populating the Aeon: we do the best we can with all our might. Thus far such a course of action produced most satisfactory results. Whether an Aeon lasts one year or up in the t housands, the pertinent ba sis of its presence is one of opportunity. We speak frequently of the \"B eing.\" It is a word that lends itself to verb and noun status, depending on its use. Being is an activity. It has goals. It uses tools and raw matter. It encounters pitfalls through its trial a nd error approaches. It gives the individual an opportunity to analyze and answer the question of whether life is worthwhile in the living of it. Such an answer depends in part on the vol ume of delusion and deceit or the lack thereof"},{"pageNumber":943,"pageContent":"within an Aeon. After personal e xposure to inflexible dogma in my own past, the previous Satanic Age anmd the current Setian Aeon stand out like breaths of fresh mountain air. There is a great deal to be said for being able to ga ther facts and best possible solutions in the place of comforting myths. Atu XX is a tunnel leading through the corridors of time. The child has grown and seen the god of his time merge into Set-Hen and from th at become the true god of himSelf. Such a god comes about not when man might soon be able to conceive of him, but rather at a time when he is ready. That is the treasure hidden behind the seated deity of Atu XX. And that is the future which we both live in and form now. Trump XXI The Universe Atu XXI, The Universe, is the final Trump in Ipsissimus Crowley's Thoth deck and is the complement of Atu 0. There are marked similar ities in the cycling essences generated by the two which are rightfully there consider ing the messages of the two Trumps. Atu XXI is one of the espressions of a special ized self-created cosmos. It is aglow with precious stones and intricacy and has taken the mo st favorable and workable elements of each prior step up the ladder in orde r to construct an envi ronment in which the individual self can function under its own laws. There are a great number of figures in this particul ar card. Some, like the ones in each corner, the Eye and the Serp ent, can be found in other cards of the Thoth deck. Each is there for a reason seen by Ipsi ssimus Crowley as having pertinence to the essence of the card. The figure of the young woman in the Trump's ce nter shows a youthful and fertile presence surrounded by all the metaphysical nutrients ne cessary to the continuation of a highly specialzed being, that of the life force mani festing itself through the feminine figure. Terrestrial nature continues its many species th rough a birth and death se ries evident to even the most casual observer. The Universe of Atu XX I is a portrayal of an unnatural nature in full flower. It will promote its own continua tion not in the way generally understood in biology, but rather in a manner unique unto itself . The living being within Atu XXI's borders has Xepered beyond any dependence on the materi al and draws life from its ongoing presence of Self. It has performed the Great Work, a th ink DCLXVI describes as a task designed \"to obtain the knowledge of the nature and power of my own being.\" It would be possible to elabor ate on each singular facet of the Atu, but the essence of the card conveys its message, that being the practice of the \"Great Work\" found referred to with such frequency in the writings of Al eister Crowley and other authors. personally I lose patience in the analysis of each minute segment of the cards, but this is not to say that taking such pains is incorrect. It is up to the indi vidual Magician to discover his own best possible means of performing the Magic of the tarot. It cannot be stressed enough that the Tarot is a tool for bringing about change in accord with Wilk and as such rightfully can be approached and carried out only from personally unique standpo ints.

The Golden Section Tarot Working In my chamber, illuminated by a single candle, I am sitting. In front of me rests a copy of The Book of Coming Forth by Night , the IAM Manuscript , and the six separate Sonnets. Several sheets of paper and two pens are also within reach. My thoughts are turned inwards and I am no longe r in my chamber. The walls of my chamber slowly fade to nothing as I gently rise above the floor, soon to find myself surrounded by total blackness. No light anywhere, not even a single star, and yet I know that I am in the Night. I am now floating towards a \"thing\" in the dist ance, the shape of which I do not recognize. I am moving quickly -- more quickly with each pa ssing second, and as I approach the \"thing\" I begin to recognize it as a building. No human designed and built this structure. It is made of sandstone, limestone, and polished black onyx. Occasional designs of br ight silver can be seen set within the gargantuan edifice as it slowly, silently, revolves. Hanging up in the sky it floats in defian ce of all the laws of physics. As I approach the structure, it ceases to revolv e, and I am filled with the feeling that inside rests great power and wisdom. More power than is necessary to destroy, and recreate the entire universe. Classification: V4 - C1D.1 - 2 Author: Lynn A.

The inte rior walls are made of the same smooth stone that covered the exteri or, and is adorned with more of the silver hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphs emit a low light, th e only source of light within the gallery. I have now passed through three doors, each larger and heavier than the last. Ahead of me, perhaps a mile away, is a fourth door. As with the other doors, I think of the fourth door as being open; as I approach the door it swings silently inward revealing a chamber of almost indescribable beauty. Standing just inside the doorway, I see in front of me a massive silver and gold inlaid throne- like chair. The chair is resting on a raised pl atform which has nine steps leading up to it. Unlike the lengthy corridor, this chamber has no ceiling, none that is, except for the stars in the sky. On the wall behind the throne-chair is a pentagram of no less than eighteen feet in diameter, Flanking the sides of the throne-chair are large braziers which have a small flame burning within them. Regardless of this, the room is remarkably well lit. At the base of the raised plat form rests several sheets of pape r and two pens. I walk to where the paper lies and sit down upon the warm fl oor. I place the paper upon my lap and pick up one of the pens. As I raise my eyes to look upon the giant pent agram I notice a yellow haze -- almost a cloud - - slowly develop in front of the throne chair. A shape not yet fully defined begins to appear inside the cloud; I am also aware of a series of low tones filling the air. The braziers flash brightly for a second, and then return to their low burning. The shape within the cloud begins to solidify, and before me sta nds a figure I am now able to recognize -- Set. What follows is my attempt to reconstruct the dialogue we shared. Ptah: (1) [smiling] That was quite an entrance. Set: [smiling] Every now and then I indulge my self in a bit of theatrics. It helps me prepare those who have not been to my House before, or who have not seen me before, for the events that will follow. Ptah: But I have seen you before. Remember the... Set: Sonnets? Yes, I remember them. You mu st admit that I spoke to you through the inner ear for the first three Sonnets and did not allow you to see me until the fourth. Also, this is the first time you have made th e journey to my House. It is an occasion of some importance requiring some form of greeting. The theatrics were in order. Ptah: Can you tell me why I ma de the journey to your house? Set: A guessing game Messenger? You will perhap s not be surprised if I say you came in answer to my request. Ptah: Request? Set: As I told you in the last Sonnet, it is time to bring the B ook of Thoth in line with this Aeon. I desire to show you how I want the ca rds to appear. We shall take them one at"},{"pageNumber":946,"pageContent":"a time and eventually the Book will be as I desire. Ptah: When shall we begin? Set: Now. This first card shall replace the card now called Art . It must be renamed The Golden Section , and drawn thusly. At this point a Tcham sceptre approximately four and a half feet long materializes in his left hand. Drawing it from left to right the new car d is brought into view much like light being admitted to a room as you raise a window shad e. The card hangs unsupported in the air and is breathtaking in design and color. Set: After you have made a few sketches I shall explain some of the finer points regarding the card's construction. Proceed. For the next twenty minutes I sketch furi ously. I am careful to maintain all spatial relationships. Frequent notes relating to color are entered in the margins. Ptah: I'm almost finished. A few more notes and... Set: You have enough. Now it is time to look at some of the implications of The Golden Section . The geometry is both simple and complex. Simple in its beauty and proportion, but complex in the message it offers. Ptah: I easily see the beauty in line and colo r, and I remember some of the laws of geometry. The message at present eludes me. Set: Do not be too concerned about the message: We shall discuss the message a little, but an in-depth discussion shall be between myself and my Magi. Ptah: I understand. Set: I know that you do. Now let us return our attention to The Golden Section . The images on the giant card now vanish leaving in their pl ace a single giant triangle. Set: This triangle is a phi triangle. What has come to be known as the Pythagorean triangle in your time. This line AC, is one -half the length of this line AB. The angle is defined as 90 degrees making this a right triangle. This triangle must be laid out with precision as all the remaining m easurements are dependent upon this first triangle. Ptah: An analogy can be drawn here. Set: Proceed. Ptah: Just as the triangle is comprised of thr ee separate sides to make a single whole from which all successive measurements are made, so too is the Great Work -- the transformation of the Magickian -- dependent upon the three elem ents of Knowledge, Desire, and Practice. The triangle further defines three planes: 1) The area outside the triangle. 2) The area inside the triangle. 3) The reverse side of the triangle. Set: Of what importance are these three defined areas?"},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"Ptah: The area outside the triangle is sym bolic of the general mass of humanity, Nietzsche's \"bungled and botched,\" through which the Elect Magi ckian must move. It is also symbolic of the Great Order called consistency which seems to surround us. The area inside the triangle is symbolic of the Elect as there is a definite separation between the Elect and the Great Order, a nd the \"bungled and botched.\" It is also rather obvious that the tria ngle could represent your se paration from Consistency. Set: And the reverse side of the triangle? Ptah: Is the hidden, or difficult to locate and ma ster side of Magick -- that which is called Black Magick. It, the reverse side of the triangle, is also the demarcation between those who can Xeper to Xem, and those who cannot. Set: On the whole, not a bad analogy. You can now see that you understand more of the message than you previously realized. Ptah: At least the analogy serves for the moment. Set: Agreed. For the next thirty minutes the rest of the geom etric relationships were placed before me and explained. Set: Now that all the mundane geometry has been placed before you, can you explain their meanings? Ptah: I can try my best. Set: Proceed, Messenger. Ptah: The circle has been traditionally taken to represent \"divinity.\" As it is used in The Golden Section I believe it to be a reminder of the Gift you bestowed upon us so many aeons ago that enables us to be our own god if we dare to accept the challenge and Come Into Being. The semi-circle arcing through the figure's loin s is representative of the life of man, as it has a definite beginning and an end... The discussion went on for the better part of an hour. Truthfully I thought the talk of geometry between us would never end, until... Set: What part does phi play in all of this? Can you see any importance at all? Ptah: Besides the obvious correlation to your pentagram and as a mathematical expression of beauty through proportion, I am no t sure of the importance of phi. Set: That's an honest answer in any event, but phi is much more than that . It is true that as a matter of expressing beauty through proportion I could have chosen another number, another symbol. The Number of phi is more than mere numbers. I shall hint only briefly at the answer, for I must have further discussion with my Magi before others may know the secret meaning of phi. Pythagoras used my pentagram as a symbol of his Doctrine of Reincarnation. Others believed phi to represent the transmigrati on of \"souls.\" Because they learned their"},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"lessons from non-Elect after centuries of misunderstanding and distortion. Their theorems are all false, the creations of men and sops to satisfy the non-Elect and ensure their continual contentm ent within the Great Order. Often has intellect been confused with Will, being explained as one must survive to ensure the continued existence of the other . Only Pythagoras possessed the necessary arithmetic skill to begin to appreciate that phi is more than a number. Though his understa nding too was in erro r, be wisely left no written record of his calculations. Ptah: Wisely? How? Set: Had Pythagoras left a written record of his calculations, the TRUE secret of phi could be easily understo od, even by the non-Elect. Ptah: Is the secret so simple that anyone might understand it? Set: Understand it, yes. Achieve it, no. The corr ect combination of elements necessary to achieve the secret of phi is found only within my Elect. Further, it can only be found within the Black Magickian. While understandin g the secret of phi makes it easier to achieve, non-understanding does not mean it cannot be achieved. Incidental accomplishment of phi has and will occur within my Order, though the process has been unconsciously discerned through Work. Higher Man ha s already achieved it, as well as a few of the Order. Ptah: Is it necessary to be aware of the secret of phi to Work toward it, in order to achieve it? Set: No. For some of my Elect, receivi ng the knowledge of the secret would be detrimental to their Work. They would be di stracted from their efforts to Xeper to Xem. Ptah: Is the secret so powerfu l as to mislead the Elect? Set: Do not blame the secret of phi for the error of th e Magickian. It is all too easy for the knowledge of the secret to be mistakenly interpreted as the direction of Work, instead of the incidental effect of th e successful Black magickian, a bonus if you Will. Ptah: If I understand you correctly, the secret of phi is not an end, but rather a by-product of Xepering. Set: You understand me correctly, but now our di scussion must end. I shall talk further on this subject with my Magi at a later da te. You must return now to your chamber. Goodbye Messenger, and Xeper... Ptah: ... ir Xem.

All of these symbols are familiar to me. Set: And their meanings? Ptah: The Pentagram is representative of the preference of change and activity over stasis and preservation. The Pentagram being encircle d, but not touching the circle, indicates the separation of you from the Great Order, and the Elect from the realm of man. The Pentagram also provides a method of computi ng the numerical value of phi, so that those who can, will learn the secret of phi. (1) The black scarab is the hieroglyphic representation of th e Word of the Aeon. Set: The Pentagram is also representative of the fact that a Black Magician must turn upside down many of the ideas and concepts he ma y have cherished before he Became. The scarab is shown moving the Pentagram ju st as my Word and Will move the Aeon. Inasmuch as the Aeon is my creation, the manifest Will, the aspect of Khephera is not inappropriate symbolism. The aspect of Khe phera is also symbolic of my own Self- creation. Ptah: Might it also be representative of the Self-creation and defini tion of those Elect who have \"found\" their Names? Set: Yes, though many who have \"found\" their Name will find that they remember as much as they create. Old things will have new meanings, and new things willhave old meanings. Ptah: Shall we pursue this point? Set: Another time perhaps. Now we must direct our attention to the Pentagram of Set . Ptah: I've noticed that you show the colors of all the levels of recogn ition either within the radians of the Pentagram itself, or in its ba ckground field. Each is logically leading to the next level of development. Set: Finally to return to the First Degree. Ptah: The point eludes me. Set: First, it demonstrates that while each of the Elect are in dividuals, you are all one Elect -- Setians. Secondly, when I raise up a Magus it is no accident, no whim of chance. I select a member of the Magistri and then school him in his Word. He will progress in the Understanding of this Word to the extent that he then Becomes the Teacher of the Elect. Then does the Elect recognize what I al ready have -- the Coming Into Being of a new Magus. Ptah: Does the progression demonstrated by th is page illustrate that the Fourth Degree cannot achieve the level of th e Sixth Degree unless they are first chosen by you to be a Fifth Degree? I notice that the color of the Sixth Degree is de finitely separate from the other five colors."},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"Set: Just as an Ipsissimus is separate from all others of the Elect by virtue of his Being; bounded by the Great Order of Consistency on ly in the sense that he possesses a mortal, corporeal vehicle -- his body -- so must his color be within the circle yet apart from the radians of the Pentagram. Ptah: That's interesting, but it stil l leaves my question unanswered. Set: So it shall remain, at least for the present. There is curren tly no need for you to have an answer. Perhaps another time. Ptah: I will shall await im patiently that discussion. Set: Of that I have no doubt. You have too long contained both your questions and your answers Ptah. You have not yet explained your Understanding of the blue sections behind the Pentagram. Ptah: Excuse me. I was distracted by our dialogue . I shall proceed. At first glance these blue sections would appear to be merely a seri es of arcs. Looking more closely you can see them for what they really are, namely 13 separate spirals ea ch sharing a common, though unseen, beginning. This beginning is at the center of the Pentagram. Set: Why do they share the common beginning? Ptah: I believe they illustrate the idea of th e division of the whole, yet division without separation, and the emanation of Es sence from a single source -- you. Set: Well done, though incomplete. The rest of its importance you will learn later. Ptah: This leaves us with the blood-red phi triangles to discu ss. They obviously represent the link to the Golden Section page you earlier designed. The blood-red color, indicative of life or survival, makes me w onder if I have guessed rightly at the secret of phi -- Survival of the Will? Set: Indeed you have. Ptah: But still I cannot prove the relationship between the numerical value of phi and the secret. I do not possess the necessary mathematical skill. Set: And that, Messenger, is preci sely the way I desire the s ituation to remain. If you did possess such skill you would then commit to pa per the proof of the secret of phi. I think this is something I would pr efer not to see for the present. Ptah: Please explain. I do not understand why the proof of an idea should be hidden from the Elect. Set: Though the formula of proof for the secret phi has not been recorded, misunderstanding, corruption, and perversion of the secret has continued unabated. Were the proof of this secret available fo r all to see, there would be no limit to the misunderstanding. Many of my Elect woul d be distracted from their Work unnecessarily. Even the non-Elect would claim the proof as their own. It is enough for the present that those who can see, Will see. Ptah: Is this then why the new pages are more si mple in design than those that they replace? Are you asking for more effort fr om your Elect to Understand?"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"Set: In part, yes. The new designs are less cl uttered as I do not thin k it is necessary to belabor the point through repe titive symbolism. Also, I ha ve mentioned in the Book of Coming Forth by Night that I no longer choose to be called by the name of a Hebrew fiend. As I no longer accept that corruption, so shall I not allow su ch corruption to be included in the Book of Thoth . Now tell me Ptah, why it is that phi was chosen to represent Survival of the Will? Ptah: My only guess is that it is an irration al number, that manipulated in some fashion approaches or achieves rationality. Set: While that is essentially true, it is inco mplete. Why was that pa rticular symbol -- the oval and the line -- chosen for such an important Truth? Ptah: As the symbol is Greek and was not developed until long after you touched the mind and culture of man I do not know. Were the symbol of Egyptian origin, appearing in the earliest time of that culture, I would have recourse to books, and thereby perhaps learn, or at least discern the nature of the symbol. Set: The Egyptian symbol is similar. The Greeks merely simplified it. Think Ptah -- an oval and a line! Ptah: The oval has traditionally been a symbol of what have been called feminine characteristics; passiveness, the negative, water, etc... All of this being based upon the oval's similarity to the yoni. The vertical li ne has been called a symbol of traditionally masculine characteristics; activ ity, the positive, fire, etc..., as it is representative of the erect phallus. The definitions are sexist in nature and extremely subjective. Set: Your editorial aside, you are esse ntially correct. but why these symbols? Ptah: If I recall correctly, du ring our conversation of the Golden Section , you said that survival of the Will was an incidental occurrence to the Xeper process. Set: Yes... Ptah: That actually attempting to Work to wards this end was both distracting and counterproductive. Set: Again correct. Ptah: Could it be that other than the mathemati cal representation, the symbol itself is a sort of signpost to point out the method and dire ction of this surviv al? That the active pursuit of Black Magick eventually brings about not only the deve lopment of the Self, but ensures survival of the Will by the lack of attention directed to that end? In effect, the active achievement is guaranteed by the passive effort. Or conversely, the passive achievement is guaranteed by active effo rt directed to another cause. The less we are concerned with survival of Will, instead directing all of our energy to Black Magick, the more progress we actually see in this survival's achievement. Set: Excellent, but again only half an answer. Why is this method successful where others fail? Ptah: Because only through the practice of Black Magick is the full potential of the Will realized: Only Black Magick demands mental effort. It utilizes the entire intellect."},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"Set: You have done well in your an alysis of the symbols of the Pentagram of Set . now let us turn our attention to th e geometry of this page.

I view the Tarot as a very useful and valid tool for Setian Xeper, and I want to encourage this trend. No written instruction on the Tarot had been aime d at the Setian just learning to use this tool until late in year XVIII. (1) Crowley's textual Book of Thoth (2) is difficult reading, and the novice must read that text two or three times before its meanings even begin to gel. Other books on the Tarot could be helpful, but a) they often deal with symbolism, philosophy, and/or method which is foreign to Setians, and b) they are rarely even considered, since they are not on the Temple's reading list. (3) I've designed this series of lessons to familiari ze Setians with the Tarot, with its symbolism, and with its methods. Think of this primer as a companion to Crowley's text, which you will use along with this primer. Students of this Tarot Primer should have Crowley's textual Book of Thoth , and you will be directed to read in that text from time to time. You should also have the Book of Thoth Tarot deck, since this primer will make repeated re ferences to the symbolism inherent in that deck. (4) If you are not familiar with Alchemy, Nu merology, or the Kaballah, you will also need to read an appropriate introduction to each (available in Cavendish's The Black Arts (5) and similar books). You will be told to read these items at the appropriate times in the following lessons."},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"Throughout these lessons I cite examples from my own experiences and actions. Learn from them, but remember that imitation, the sincerest fo rm of flattery, is also the weakest form of magic. If such actions/beliefs work for you, if they mesh well with your magical being, then use them. Otherwise develop your own practi ces and beliefs from my discussions and examples. Crowley repeatedly stated, \"M y Kaballah is not your Kaballa h.\" Neither is my Tarot your Tarot. As with any valid endeavor or study, our similarities help us communicate; they help us learn from each other. But, as with any magical endeavor, our studies and workings must reflect each magician's individuality and uniqueness. Since my personal experiences and outlook will color this primer, and since my experiences and outlook are in turn colored by my relationshi p with the neteru Shuti, Shu and Tefnut, let me briefly introduce them. Shu is an elder god of Egypt. Most tales state that Shu and Tefnut, the twin lion gods, were created by Amon-Ra himself, befo re any other Gods were presen t. Yet others claim that Shu and Tefnut were self-created. Shu and Tefnut were the first male and female gods, and were therefore the first gods to exercise sex. From them came Geb and Nuit. These latter two gods were so pr olific that Shu stepped betwee n to separate them. A common drawing of Shu (Air) shows him standing upon Geb (Earth), holding Nuit (Sky) aloft. Shu and Tefnut are opposites, each defining the other, and each requiring the other's existence. Shu and Tefnut can represent Oppos ition in active Balance. Shu wears the Ma'at feather, which is often used as a hieroglyph for Shu's name, reflecting the importance of Balance in Shu's outlook and activity. Shu is also known as the god of the mind, as th e light of the Sun, and as a god of intelligence and knowledge. Tefnut is a goddess of spirit, of emotion and intern al desire and will, of that which is hidden and hiding. She is also the goddess of fog, cloud, and storm. Shu and Tefnut together, the twin lion gods, are Shuti. Shuti is balanced, active opposition. As we study the Tarot you may discover symbolic relationships between these different aspects of Shu and Tefnut. Since this is a primer on Tarot and no t on Egyptian gods, I'll leave all further examination/analysis for the interested student; any Setian who wishes to explore these neteru may do so within the sphere of the Order of Shuti. (Those interested in other Egyptian neteru may al so contact me for assistance and/or leads to others who may be working with any neters of interest.) 1 The Tarot: A Synopsis , by Priest Robert Menschel. The Scroll of Set , Vol. IX, No 3. 2 Reading List # 9L 3 Entry 4N was discovered and added to the Reading List only years after the initial publication of this primer. 4 Throughout this primer, I will use the underlined Book of Thoth to refer t the text, while the Book of Thoth without underlining (and usually w ithout bold print or italics) will re fer to the deck of tarot cards. 5 Reading List #4C. "},{"pageNumber":956,"pageContent":"Introduction The Tarot is a very popular su bject among most occult societie s, but for a long time it was considered relatively unimportant within the Temple of Set. Only one book about the Tarot was included in its Reading List for many year s, and mention of the Tarot almost never appeared in its writings. This introduction discusses why and how some of us can benefit from the study of the Tarot. (6) The philosophy of the Tarot (and of its use) is of primary importance to this discussion. Should an Initiate study and use the Tarot? Why? What benefits can the Tarot gain for Setians? Tarot cards are very popular fortune telling props. Any we ll-stocked occult shop offers several different decks for sale. Many practitione rs of the occult use the Tarot, and most of these use it for some form of fortune telling, of divination. Divination requires a belief in a basically unchangeable future. Instead, the Temple of Set and its Initiates feel that any Aware Setia n can control his or her own destiny. (7) Setians are notably unpredictable, and seem to very successfully avoid predetermined futures. The science fiction Dune series hypothesizes beings with the ability to foretell the future, and other beings who are temporally \"invisible\" to the former -- be ings whose futures can not be foretold. We Setians succeed in being the unpr edictable latter to the Tarot's former. Rather than seeing it as a tool for divination, Setians look upon the Tarot as a language, a complex, abstract, symbolic (somewhat hierogl yphic) language. We feel we can use this language to help our Higher Selves (that which we are B ecoming) communicate with our Active Selves (that which we have Become). We use the Tarot to describe events and ideas that are not readily apparent to the conscious self. The supraconscious self (our Higher Self) already has much of the information that the conscious self (our Active Self) strives for. We know more th an we think we know. The Tarot can serve as a very useful tool fo r discovering how much we actually do know. Many of us can benefit from this aid to in ternal communication. It can serve both as a technique for bringing our Active Selves closer to our Higher Selves (speeding our Xeper), and as a means for communicating ideas and facts to our Active Selves. There are dangers in attempting this communication. It is easy to believe that we are getting a message from our higher selves, when inst ead we are simply reading what we want to read, when we are being misled by our Lower Selves (that which we have not yet outgrown). Those of us who have the greatest need for this communications tool, who don't have easy communications with our Higher Selves unless we use tools like the Tarot, also have the highest degree of exposure to this dange r. Therefore, not all magicians should use the Tarot. To safely use the Tarot, you need to achieve Balan ce and Perception to the point that you know when a message is real, or at least vali d, as opposed to when you might just be fooling yourself."},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"The danger is real -- a magician who misleads himself is going to lose his Way. Therefore you should not Act on your Readings unless you are well Balance d, unless you are able to successfully determine whether a \"message\" is valid or imagined. You don't need this Balance to study the language of the Tarot, or to do readings. You can practice the Tarot at any time. Simply don't Act on your Readings unless you are Balanced and Know that the Readings are True. Given that we recognize these di fferent states of being, and gi ven that we want to use the Tarot to enhance communications from our Hi gher Selves to our Active Selves, how do we do this? The Tarot is a language, a symbolic language. To be able to read the language we need to be able to understand the symbols. The symbols in the Book of Thoth come from Numerology, Kaballah, and Alchemy. To Master the Tarot we would need to Master these fields as well. Fortunately we don't need to Master a language to use it. We simply need to understand enough of it to send and receive th e simpler messages. \"Me hungry,\" serves almost as well as \"I worked through lunch-time today, and that ju icy, sizzling steak smells divine; may I have some please?\" To begin studying the Tarot, you should be fam iliar with the three fields of symbology. This primer will tell you when to read some introductory chapters on each if you need to, and when to read Crowley's Book of Thoth . You'll probably need to read that latter book from cover to cover two or three times, sin ce the subject matter is comple x, and since that book is not quickly understood. Keep the cards handy while you read the Book of Thoth , and refer to the cards when Crowley refers to their colors, shapes, figures, and sy mbolism. Do your best to See the language. At this point most Setians (including the autho r) have tried to take time to \"study\" individual cards. I have not yet seen this method wor k. Instead, I suggest you now do actual readings, and this primer will walk you through several actual readings. (8) Lessons 11 through 18 of this primer teach the Wasserman Layout. You may use this layout if you wish. Or you may find a descri ption of some other well-def ined layout, in almost any Tarot text. Choose a question of some importa nce to you, and magically do a reading, calling on your Higher Self to pick out the cards for the layout. (9) The advantage of this method is that the layout gives each position meaning, and gives meaning to the positional relationships between cards. You can use these defined meanings to enhance your understanding of the cards themselves. Keep the Book of Thoth handy. You will probably want to use it to check out each card in your first several readings. You will refer to the book less often as you become familiar with the cards, but you will continue to occasionally need it for a l ong while. (This primer's author still does.)"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"If you are unsure about your ability to determine the validity of a reading, then by all means you should continue to practice re ading the Tarot. Record the r eadings, and watch to see if they prove true. We find that, given time, a ny serious magician can develop the perception which indicates whether a give n reading is valid or not. Once you've begun to develop a familiarity with the cards, there are seve ral tricks you can use to increase your facility. One such trick is to do readings on trivial quest ions, that require simple yes/no answers. Ask the question, lay out the cards, and quickly de termine the answer. You may then study the cards if you wish, to verify and support the an swer you so quickly read. (And, of course, you should validate your readings ag ainst the objective universe. Do es the answer prove true?) Another method is to read the Tarot for other people, people you care about. The desire to read the cards correctly for these people will strengthen you r motivation and increase your abilities. Keep the reference books handy, for you do want to be accurate, and you may need the books to remind you of all appl icable symbolism and meaning. Another trick I use on occasion is to actually tell fortunes in a carnival setting. I will sometimes use my Tarot cards to tell fortunes at some of the more free-wheeling conventions I attend. At one event I told about 20 fortunes in a three hour period. (10) Another method of improving your skill, or perhaps it's a result of improving your skill, is the development of new layouts. Modify layouts yo u're familiar with, and create new ones, as appropriate for the cause of the reading. Which Tarot deck should you use? This introduction has so far assumed that you wi ll be using Crowley's Book of Thoth deck. There are many, many decks available in any we ll-stocked occult shop, a nd several in most well-stocked game stores and book stores. How do we choose? Tarot decks differ primarily in three ways: a) a ll cards may have pictures, or only some cards will have pictures (usually the trumps). b) the pictures may be fairly simple and straightforward, or may be complex and filled with colors, shapes, and figures. c) the pictures may be drawn from different cultural bac kgrounds (such as decks based upon ancient Egyptian or Chinese cultures). In addition to the importance of Crowley and Thelema to our magical heritage, many Setians find that the many colors and symbols of the B ook of Thoth appeal to us. We find this deck, this language, to be fuller and more expressi ve than any other. The vocabulary in this symbolic language is larger and more colorf ul than in any other popular Tarot deck. Many people can not use Crowley's deck precisel y for this reason; they are confused by the abundance of symbolism. The deck by Arthur Ed ward Waite and Pamela Colman Smith is the most popular Tarot deck, with simpler design s and more commonly accepted symbolism than Crowley's deck. This deck (often called the \"R ider\" deck or \"Waite-R ider\" deck) is probably the better deck for most people, and is satisf actory for those Setians who can not use the Book of Thoth."},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"I recommend that most people avoid decks that are older than Waite's. Most of these do not have pictures on all of their cards, but only on the trumps and sometimes the court cards. The symbolic language is more archaic, and harder for our modern conscious selves to understand. However, if one of these st rongly appeals to you, use it. There are several modern Tarot decks, such as the Aquarian deck, which may be very well suited for many people. The only way to find out is to look at the deck and see how the symbolism, colors and figures, appeal to each of us. Do they speak to you? Examine the decks; examine the reference books related to the decks, and choose the deck that's right for you. As a beginner, do not use a deck unless you can find some book or person who can give you assistance with the symbolism of that deck. Wh en you have gained a lo t of experience with the Tarot, and when you can obtain an understand ing of a deck's language without assistance, then you can experiment with decks that do not have reference books. (This primer \"requires\" the use of Crowle y's Book of Thoth. We reference symbolism contained only in this Book, and other decks wi ll not work as well w ith this primer. If you cannot use Crowley's Book of Thoth, then 1) find a deck which does work for you, and 2) follow this primer with both decks; follow each lesson first with the Book of Thoth, so you can see my references in context; then read /perform each lesson again, using your own deck, changing the symbolism [and meaning] to fit.) Does Tarot reading work? As a student of the Tarot for several years now, I can state definitely that yes, it does, for appropriate questions. Why does it work? Which questions are appropria te? Should you repeatedly ask the Tarot for information, or should you refer to it only on occasion, for the really BIG questions? Is the Tarot a true book storing the Wisdom of the Anci ents? Some of these questions are answered later in this primer. You will have to develop your own opini ons for the other topics as you work with the Tarot. 6 This introduction includes and updates the Scroll of Set article cited by footnote 1 on page 2. 7 See Peter D. Ouspensky's The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution. ans also his The Fourth Way (RL entries 19B, 19C). 8 This first publication of the primer contains only one such reading. Additional lessons are planned for this primer, and these lessons shall be added through additional readings. 9 Perhaps our Higher Selves are able to divine each ca rd's position through occult powers, or are able to remember and calculate card positions despite our shuffles . Or perhaps the cards are chosen at random, and our Higher Selves simply direct our attention at the appropriate symbology. You will have to reach your own conclusion about why the Tarot works. 10 These fortunes were for people who can't avoid predeter mined fates as readily as we can. They were also obviously not the in-depth readings I do for myself or for my close friends. Those latter readings generally take one or two hours each to complete. Lesson 1 – The Tarot and Magic This first lesson discusses some theories conc erning the Tarot. Like in the Introduction, we will attempt to remove the hocus-pocus from this subject, so we can use the Tarot as a"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"magical tool with an open and aware mind, rath er than mindlessly following someone else's grimoire. Occultists often claim that the Book of Thoth (or the Tarot in general) embodies the ancient wisdom of the Egyptians. When did the Ancients encode their wisdom into the designs of the Tarot? The best scholarly/scientific evidence indicates that Tarot cards (as we know them) were first created well after the fall of Rome, and that their design stabilized during the nineteenth century. The symbols of most Tarot decks date from medieval times. Other decks, even those with more \"ancient\" symbolism, bear relatively recent dates of creation. Postulate : There is no ancient wisdom in the Tarot -- simply some relatively modern symbolism. This opinion is substantiated by the increased value of Crowley's relatively new Book of Thoth deck (11) over earlier Tarot decks. Further advances should lie ahead, depending upon the talent and wisdom of the designers of new decks. Some such Work has been done within the Temple of Set, and we look forward to seeing more original Tarot design from Setian sources. (12) The Tarot can be used as a tool in several di fferent ways. The most common approach is to use the Tarot as a tool for divi nation. This is also the most dangerous use of the Tarot for Setians. We must always remember that the future is ours to shape according to our Will. Please read Dr. Aquino's essay entitl ed \"The Science of Divination\". (13) How does the Tarot work its magic? Obviously there is nothing magi cal about the printing presses at U. S. Games Systems, Inc., wher e most Tarot cards in America are printed (including the Book of Thoth). A card is a card is a card. The material that the card is made of has no magical quality. The designs on the cards may have magical quali ties of their own (as does the Pentagram of Set, (14) but that does not explain how the right card gets laid out into the correct position in a layout. Postulate : A deck of Tarot cards has no inherent magi c. Then either all claims for the Tarot are fraudulent or false, (and we are wasting our time), or we n eed to look elsewhere for the magic of the Tarot. Theory : The magic of the Tarot comes from the magician who uses the Tarot. (15) For now, let us assume that there is no magic in the cards or in their designs. Let us assume that all magic comes from the psychic or magi cian who uses the cards. We are then free to examine how to use the cards. 11 The Book of Thoth was designed in the early twentieth century. 12 See Priest Magister Lynn Norton's three works in the Ruby Tablet of Set : Golden Section Working, Atu XV: The Devil and Atu XVII: The Pentagram of Set . Also see Priest Whitaker's The Tarot in Flames from Hell I.1, Mar XXII."},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"13 Scroll of Set , IX, Aug/Sept XVIII. 14 See Black Magic and The Pentagram of Set , both in The Crystal Tablet of Set . 15 Note that both postulates and theory need further exam ination before we can perm anently accept them as fact, examination we will not attempt in this primer. Lesson 2 – Elements of a Reading Every Tarot reading includes several basic ingr edients: the reader (you), the querant, the question, the cards, the layout, th e reading, and the answer. This lesson briefly investigates each of these ingredients in turn. Later lessons will examine several of them in greater depth, but all will be introduced here. 1. The Reader This is the psychic, the magician, the pe rson who reads the cards and who answers the querant's question. There are at leas t four classes of Tarot reader: o There are reports of psychics who can foretell the future, who can answer questions without the use of tools like th e Tarot. By shaking a person's hand, or after holding someone's jewelry, they know what needs to be said. (16) I have met several people who claim to have this power. They report that few people, few querants, are able to beli eve in these fortune tellers' psychic powers, while many people will believe predictions \"bas ed\" on a Reading. Many of these psychics will therefore use props. Again, most people will not believe a psychic who has no physical ev idence for his/her startling claims about the future. \"Seeing is believing\" for many such people, and they will accept a future dictated by some \"physi cal\" method, beit Tarot, I Ching, or tea leaves. Some of these psychics choose Tarot car ds as their props. These readers, knowing what needs to be said, use whic hever cards happen to appear in the layout to proclaim the required answer, regardless of whether the traditional interpretations of those cards do or don't support that answer. o The great majority of Tarot readers are charlatans. They charge fees for their services, and presume to answer questi ons, again using Tarot cards as props. These fakers know that they can not foretell the future, but they are willing to take money for that service anyway. These charlatans often su pport their claims of mys tical knowledge by relaying information to the querant which \"could not be known any other way\" (than mystically). Their \"knowledge\" is often general enough to apply to (almost) all querants and questions, or this \"know ledge\" has been extracted from the querant during the reading, either verbally or through body language. (17) "},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"Often these carnival readers need only spin a good tale, manipulating their story to appease the audience. Most r ubes will believe such a story because they want to believe the story. o A third group of Tarot readers believes devoutly in the magical power of the cards. They do not recognize any ma gical power within themselves. They have learned by rote the traditional meanings of the cards in traditional layouts, and they use this \"knowledge\" to answer the querant's questions. Like most successful occultists outsid e the Temple of Set, the successful readers among this group are able to unknowingly call upon their own personal magical powers and perform valid readings in spite of their beliefs. o Finally let us discuss the fourth class of Tarot reader, the type of reader you will be if you follow this prim er's course of education. These are readers who intelligently a nd consciously use th eir own personal, magical powers to strengthen their Taro t readings. These readers recognize the magical (and other) abilities within the Self, and they use those abilities when reading the Tarot. 2. The Querant The querant asks a question. You, the reader, may be the querant -- you may ask and answer your own question. Or the querant may be some other person, or may be a group of people. The great majority of my readings are done solo, with myself as reader, querant, and audience. I perform many othe r readings for close friends and relatives, people for whom I care strongly. Tarot readings abso rb a goodly amount of time and require much work. I therefore usually perform my readings for those who are important to me. I have done readings for acquaintances, and even for strangers. These readings have been done for some type of recompense (rarel y money), to justify the time and effort I spend on these readings. Many Tarot readers sell their services, at psyc hic fairs, at night cl ubs and restaurants, at carnivals, and out of their homes and/ or offices. These readers often perform the great majority of their readi ngs for strangers, and for cash. (18) The querant is most often an individual, but I also perform (and have witnessed) readings for two or three pe ople as querant (eg: a parent and sibling, a couple, small family, or some similarly close relationship). There may or may not be an audience, pe ople in attendance who are not querant. I abhor an audience when reading for some one else, since the questions and answers tend to be private, and the response is nece ssarily verbal. I have noticed at psychic"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"fairs that Tarot readers (at least those read ers I respect) will watch for and send away any audience, to preserve the querant's privacy. I have done several solo readings (readings with myself as querant) with mundanes around and watching, but these readings have been silent, and I have kept all results to myself. More interestingly, I of ten do solo readings with Setians in attendance. I've learned to share my investigations with interested brot hers and sisters. Their inspired comments frequently add depth to such readings. We occasionally circulate readings within the Temple. These often examine questions of general interest, and in these cases the distinctions between reader, querant, and audience begin to fade. (19) 3. The Question Questions may be specific or general in natu re, on private topics or public topics. They may require yes or no answers, or the answers may be open-ended. There is no question that the Tarot can not answer, or at least point the querant towards an answer. I find that the more sp ecific and private questi ons tend to result in better readings (more satisfying bot h to myself and to the querant). (20) For this reason, the first sample readings in this primer will answer specific and private questions. The question must be important to the quera nt. This importance adds to the querant's participation, to the atmosphere of the reading, and to the im pact of the reading, thereby strengthening your magic. I strongl y recommend against using the Tarot to answer someone else's flippant questions. (As stated in the In troduction, I sometimes answer trivia l questions using Tarot cards, doing so specifically to practice interpreting the card s. These readings are almost always solo, for no querant or audience other than myself. On rare occasions I've done readings on trivial questions asked by othe rs, but I've done the readings for my own benefit, to practice, and my answers to the querant have been accordingly short and simple, trivial and of questionable use.) When I prepare to perform readings for others, I often find that they have not formulated a question. I then counsel the querant concerning the differences between classes of questions -- private vs public, specific vs general, yes/no vs open-ended. I then recommend they find and ask a specific, private, yes/no question. I give them a short while to do so while I prepare the cards. They often can not find such a specific que stion, and the querants will then ask general questions, such as \"what does the future hold?\" While the cards can and have answered such general questi ons, in many of these cases the cards will answer an unasked specific question inst ead of the general question."},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"Indeed, on rare occasions, the cards will even ignore a specific question asked by the querant, and will instead answer a different, more important question. Be prepared for such changes in direction. (21) 4. The Cards One of the first tasks of the Tarot reader is to prepare the cards (and the reader). Much of this activity takes place outside the reading. Familiarize yourself with the cards, their l ooks, and their feel. Avoid the disconcerting experience of dropping the oversize cards of the Book of Thoth in public, or spraying them across the table. (22) Learn how to shuffle th e cards, so that you look experienced and feel comfortable during a reading. Flex the cards, so they are not too stiff during the reading. Many texts and Tarot readers believe the ca rds have a magical quality similar to sanctity -- a quality which is lost if th e cards are touched by a mundane person, or by someone with an unhealthy (or \"evil\") aura. You should be aware of this belief, and always be courteous; you should refrain fr om touching someone else's cards unless invited. And you, the Setian Tarot reader, must avoid having such misconceptions. Remember our postulates and theory: Taro t cards, paper and ink, have no inherent magic when you first take them out of th eir box. All magical en ergy in these cards comes from the magician, from the reader, from you. You may view this as a process similar to th e charging of any magical tool, such as the wand, grail, sword, or bell. However, most magical tools are used only in ritual, by yourself or with other magici ans. Tarot cards tend to be more open to display and public use. Ritual or not, each reading is a magical activity. Each reading (properly and magickally conducted) adds to the magical charge of the cards. And no person on Earth can destroy that power, power stored through dozens of readings, readings in which magic was consciously wielded, wielded by the Adept Setian Magician. I treat my cards with the same respect I ha ve for all my magical tools. I recognize the magical investment I've stored in them. I also recognize the more public nature of my Tarot cards. If the idly curious reach for my cards, I w ill politely but firmly instruct them about propriety and courtesy. I also take adva ntage of the cards' Command To Look, their attractive and Vampyric powers as works of ma gical art, and transfer some (previously wasted) magical power from the person into the cards. The physical cards might be touched, but the magic within them not only remains inviolate, but grows stronger. I almost always have the querant handle the cards during the reading. Sometimes the querant will shuffle the cards, sometimes cu t the cards, and sometimes just lay a hand upon the deck while concentr ating on the question."},{"pageNumber":965,"pageContent":"I use this contact to estab lish or strengthen the magical link between the querant and myself, increasing my ability to a) magica lly know more about the querant, and b) use the querant's generally untapped magical powers. (23) I freely allow magician friends of mine, Setians and otherw ise, to handle my cards. Because these friends view my cards as magical tools, each such handling adds to the cards' magical charge, and adds to my re spect for the cards as magical tools. Many Tarot readers feel that continuous and/or prolonged contact with the cards will strengthen their powers. They often lay th e cards under their pillow, and keep them near at hand during most of the day. Reme mber that the cards themselves have no power -- the magic comes from you. If such practices will strengthen your magical ties with the cards, use them. Many Tarot readers keep their cards in a pouch -- several books on the Tarot recommend a silk pouch, for purity and for protection against harmful \"vibrations\". I had a pouch made for my Book of Thoth -- wh en the box they originally came in fell apart. This pouch is made of the same (e xpensive) black angora wool as my ritual robe. It was made for me by my wife, a magi cian in her own right (once an Adept in the Temple of Set). The purpose of the pouch is fairly mundane -- to physically protect the cards from damage. I do so in a manner which increases my respect for the cards, increases the magical aura of my relationship with the ca rds, and increases the respect others will feel towards my cards. 5. The Layout Layout : N 1: the act or process of planning or laying out in detail. 2: the plan or design or arrangement of someth ing that is laid out. 3: something that is laid out. VT 1: to prepare for viewing. 2: to plan in detail. The term \"layout\" can be used to mean the process of laying the cards on the table, or to mean the pattern in which the cards are laid. We will use both meanings within this primer. (24) Most people look at the magic of Tarot readi ng as being a) in the process of laying the Tarot cards on the table, b) in the cards themselves, and/or c) in the patterns into which the cards fall. Physical, unmagical, unthinking cards can not control their shuffle, their cut, nor control how they are laid out . Instead, the magic is concen trated in later stages, the reading and the answer . It is possible to employ magic during the layout, and the talented Setian Tarot reader will do so; but remember that this magic of layout is secondary to the magic of reading. Three activities are involved in producing th e layout: choosing the layout, determining how cards will be selected, and fina lly, actually selecting the cards."},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"o Choosing the Layout: Many layouts can be chosen. Books on the Tarot discuss several different layouts, and we will [eventually] (25) examine some of these. We may also examine others, developed by Setians, in later lessons. I find and develop new layouts (or modify/enhance old ones) fairly regularly. Layouts have several characteristics, which are represented by the following questions:  How many cards will be dealt?  Where will the cards be placed?  In what order will the layout be filled?  Will reversed (inverse) cards be used?  What does the position of any card mean (regardless of the actual card which falls into that position)?  How will cards relate to others in adjacent, nearby, or geometrically connected positions? Different questions call for different types of answers, and different types of answers often call for different layouts. Any layout can be used for any question, and a reader who uses just one layout can be quite successful (almost all of us start this way) . But as you develop familiarity with several layouts, you'll find that you start preferring certain layouts for certain types of questions. o How to Select the Cards: How will you select the cards? There are many options, including:  Will you deal all cards straight from the top of the deck?  or cut each card individually?  or cut and deal three card s, then repeat until done?  or pick the cards out of a spread?  or pick every fifth card?  Will you preselect one or two cards to start the layout (ie: pull them before the shuffle), and then deal the others?  Will you have the querant choose one, some, or all of the cards? We have already had the querant ask the question. The querant has concentrated on the question while you s huffled the cards. You also used this time to raise your Higher Self, increa sing your magical powers and intuition for the purposes of this reading. Use your Higher Self to answer the above questions, to determine which layout to use, and to determine how to fill that layout."},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"Having made the above decisions, it is now time to select the cards. You (and/or the querant) will pull them from the deck and lay them on the table. You will then be ready for o The Reading This is where the magic abounds. As discu ssed in the Introduc tion, the Tarot is a symbolic language, through which our Higher Selves can communicate with our Active Selves. We are now ready to read the messages written with those symbols. Reading these messages is easier if your Higher Self has influenced the choice of the layout, and has influenced the se lection and placement of the cards. But such influence is not necessary as long as you successfully invoke your Higher Self for the reading. During the reading, you will an alyze the cards that have appeared in the layout, correlating their symbolism and position with the question. You will analyze the symbolism of the cards in the lay out, interpreting how the symbolism of these cards answers the querant's question. You will also investigate the reliability of this reading; how valid is the answer? Assuming the answer is valid, you will also use the process of reading to build the querant's confidence in th e cards, and in the resulting answer. Of all the phases, you will spend most of your time and effort in the actual reading. This is also the phase where you will need detailed knowledge of the symbolism of the cards. This primer will spend much of its volume, and as a student you will spend much of your tim e, concentrating on this phase, the reading of cards. o The Answer The question is generally answered duri ng the previous phase, in conversation and discussion with the querant while analyzing the cards (ie: during the reading). However, the answer is ofte n not recognized as such during that phase (at least by the querant), since it can be hidden among other verbiage. We therefore conclude the reading by briefly and concis ely (re)stating the answer. We also take this opportunity to clarif y any points that may have confused or bothered the querant. This phase should take a comfortably long (or short) period of time. By allowing the querant to ponder the answer, with the cards still on the table, by allowi ng the querant to ask questions and receive answers concerning the Answer and about the cards , you continue to build the querant's confidence in your analysis and answer. 16 Ignoring for now the fact that the futu re is malleable, subject to change, and ignoring the difficulty of proving the abilities of such psychics, let us assume that they exist for the purposes of this discussion. 17 The techniques used to get such information have been documented in many books dealing with scams and"},{"pageNumber":968,"pageContent":"cons. Such techniques can be very useful for the magician practicing lesser black magic. 18 In the first printing of this primer (year XXII), I didn' t know of any Setian who sold readings, and commented that this could be a pleasurable way for some of us to earn additional cash. Since then, one Adept that I know of has found this an enjoyable source of income. 19 Such as in Order of Leviathan , Volume II, No. 1, Jan. XX. 20 Other readers may feel otherwise. 21 Realize that \"the cards\" do not do this, but rather your Higher Self, through the process of Tarot reading. It is easier and more traditional to discuss actions taken by \"t he cards\", but you the reader, Setian Magician, must never lose sight of the true source of activity and meaning. 22 Recent years have seen the distribution of the Book of Thoth in \"normal\" si zed cards, as well as the traditional over-sized cards. The author prefers th e over-sized cards, partly because they are \"different\" in this way as well as others, but feel free to use whichever size of Tarot card feels best for you. 23 I hold the theory that allmost all of human species share Set's genetic gift, and have some magical powers, rarely used. Those who are drawn to the occult, drawn to my cards, are so drawn partly because of that magical essence. Just as Setians can share their power in ritual, the Adept should be able to use this untapped pwer held by others, especially those who don't know what they have. 24 The advanced student may benefit from investigating other meanings extracted from the dictionary. 25 This first publication teaches one such layou t. Others are planned for future lessons. Lesson 3 – The Cards Almost every book which teaches Tarot devotes th e largest part of itself to explaining the cards and their symbolism. Th e symbolism of tarot cards is complex and extensive; no wonder so many people believe the cards themselves are magical. This primer is different. We rely on Crowley's te xt to discuss most of the symbolism, leaving this primer free to concentrate on the process of laying and reading the cards. In this lesson (and the next several) we summarize the more globally applicable points of tarot symbology. You will later study Crowley's text for more deta il. Please look at your cards as you continue in this lesson. The standard tarot deck contains 78 cards. (26) Of these 78 cards, 22 are Trumps (also called Keys or Atu ). The remaining 56 cards are divided into four suits of fourteen cards each. Each suit contains four court cards, plus ten numbered cards. The four suits of the Book of Thoth are Wands , Cups, Swords, and Disks. These names are printed on the Book of Thoth, but in his text Crowley also freque ntly uses the name \"Staffs\" for Wands, and \"Pentacles\" for Disks. The suits can also have different names, and you should recognize these alternate names when you encounter them in the literature or in other decks. In the Xultun taro t deck these four suits are named Staffs, Cups, Swords, and Jades. Just as the order of suits is important in Br idge and similar card games, the above order of tarot suits is vital to the symbolism within the Tarot. (27) No suit is \"better\" or \"more powerful\" than another, but this order supplies meanings which are critical to th e symbolism and to our understanding. You will learn the meanings of this order in later lessons. The four court cards are Knight, Queen, Prince, and Princess. Again, the order of these cards is symbolically important."},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"The court cards can have different names in di fferent decks (eg: the Xultun deck calls the court cards Lord, Lady, Warrior, and Servant) . But within traditional decks the pattern of court cards will be the same. You will find two greater and two lesser court cards (often elder and younger, or royal and not royal). Look again to see two active and two passive court cards (often shown as masculine and feminine, respectively). These court cards are ordered greater-ac tive, greater-passive, lesser-active, and lesser-passive. (28) We will discuss why later. Unlike the King, Queen, and Jack in most playin g card games, there is no value difference between these court cards -- the Knight is not \"better\" than the Prince, just different. Likewise, the numbered cards (ace through ten) within the Tarot have no order of value . The numeric order is used to apply symbolic meaning to the cards. The Trumps are also numbered, and the numbers again reflect or instill symbolism in the cards. No Trump is \"better\" than any other. One misconception held by most novi ce readers is that the Trumps (Keys) are \"better\", or at least \"more significant\" than th e suit cards (especially more significant than the ace through ten, with the court cards having an importance so mewhere between that of the Trumps and the numbered cards). Instead, the Atu (and their symbolism) may be considered to be more complex than the court cards, which in turn may be considered to be more complex than the numbered suit cards. There is no value differentiation within the tarot deck. (29) As mentioned in the Introduction, tarot sym bology is drawn from three schools: Alchemy, Numerology, and the Kaballah. To Master the Ta rot we would need to master these other schools as well. Fortunately, we need but a simp le, basic knowledge of these school s to begin using the Tarot. And that simple knowledge is readily available. We can approach the tarot's symbolism from tw o different directions. We can concentrate our study on the cards, referencing the three fields of symbology as necessary. Or we can concentrate on the three fields of symbology, studying their corres pondences within the Tarot. Most texts use one method or the other. This primer does both. First (in each of the next se veral lessons) we will concentr ate on matching one school of symbology with the Tarot. When we have fini shed that summary of tarot symbology, we will then be free to work with the cards, and will refer to each of the schools as needed. 26 Most modern decks, created in the late nineteenth and twentieth century, conform to this standard. 27 Some decks may alter this order (or rather, texts which discuss such decks do). We will use this given order throughout the primer, leaving variations as exercises for advanced study. 28 A few decks (or texts) of questionable popularity and value will change thos order, but we will use the court cards in the above order. Again, such variations will be left for advanced study. 29 This complexity is only an appearance, useful to the re ader first beginning to use the Tarot. The astute and dedicated reader can find complexities within the numbered suit cards equal to that within the Atu. "},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":" Lesson 4 – Alchemy If you are not yet familiar with Alchemy, you w ill need to read an introduction on it. The most readily available intr oduction is probably found in Cavendish's The Black Arts . Learn enough from that introduction so that you know the four elements (Fire, Water, Air, and Earth), the spiritual qualities they reflect, and the relationships between these elements. The rest of this primer will assume you have this basic knowledge. (You should also develop a basic knowledge of the alchemical m eanings of the triad Sulfur, Salt, and Mercury. We will not discuss these latt er ideas within this lesson, but will refer to them on occasion in later lessons as we do read ings. Crowley refers to these symbols fairly heavily in his text.) If you need this knowledge, please read that introduction to Alchemy now. Continue reading this primer when you have complete d that introduction to Alchemy. Do not continue with this primer until you have read some introduction to Alchemy. You will need this knowledge to use the Tarot intelligently and correctly. This primer will not by itself give you an adequate grounding in Alchemy. (30) Alchemy's primary correlation to the Tarot lies in the four suits, corre sponding to the four elements. Each element is represented by one su it, and that suit's meaning revolves around the corresponding element's attributes. Table 1 lists each suit with the corresponding al chemical element, and the human attributes associated with that element. We see in the table that the entire suit of Wa nds is influenced by and represents Fire, Energy and Will. All Wands concern energy and will, and this relationship must be taken into account when interpreting these cards. Unfortunately for the student, the elementa l correspondences can be contradictory. The element of Water can represent Understanding, a nd this is one of the primary attributes as listed in Table 1. But also remember that wate r is a shifting element, and images seen though water (or reflected in water) shift and change without warning. Water is a very illusive (illusion-creating) element, as is partially indicated by Water's relationship to Emotion (emotions are so subject to change, and they can often blind a person to the truth). Element  Attributes Suit  Court  Card Fire Energy/Will (Thelema) Wands Knight Water Emotion/Understanding Cups Queen Air Intelligence/Intellect Swords Prince Earth Physical or Worldl y Concerns Disks Princess Table 1: Alchemical Correspondences of the Tarot Suits and Court Cards"},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"Similarly, Air/Swords can represent Intelligence , the astute mind which can analyze situations and systems, and which can solve problems. Air/ Swords can also represent Intellect, or the danger of intellectualiz ing, ie: the danger of thinking about something rather than taking action. You will learn to apply the appropriate alchemical meanings with practice. In interpreting each of the suit cards, you w ill apply the symbolism of the number (or personage) to the symbolism of the suit. As you will read later, the Kaballic Ten represen ts the purely material world, with no spiritual quality or value. As the Disk s represent Earth, physical c oncerns, so the Ten of Disks represents the ultimate physical manifestation, representation, and use of this element. The card Wealth, with its title and picture, represents purely monetary, physical wealth, with no higher attributes or saving graces. In addition to the four suits, th e alchemical elements are also represented by the four court cards, as shown by Table 1. The Knight tends to represent a fiery, willful, and/or energetic force, the Queen a liquid, shifting, emotional, and/or understanding force, the Prince an airy, inte llectual, thoughtful, and/or intelligent force, and the Princess an earthy, supportiv e, nurturing, and/or crushing force. We pointed out the order of th e court cards in Lesson Three. This order rises from the alchemical relationships discu ssed here. Fire is seen as th e stronger, more active element (represented by the mature male). Water is seen as the stronger, more passive element (mature female). Air is seen as the weaker, active elemen t (less mature male), and Earth is seen as the weaker, passive element (less mature female ). By remembering these correspondences you will strengthen your ability to read the Tarot. Each of these four court cards are found in each of the four suits . The Knight is therefore the Fiery aspect of whichever suit he wears, the Queen the Watery aspect, etc. As Crowley does in his text, we list the sixteen court cards and their elemental correspondences in Table 2. (31) Court Card Elemental Combinations Knight of Wands Fiery aspect of Fire Queen of Wands Watery aspect of Fire Prince of Wands Airy aspect of Fire Princess of Wands Earthy aspect of Fire Knight of Cups Fiery aspect of Water Queen of Cups Watery aspect of Water Prince of Cups Airy aspect of Water Princess of Cups Earthy aspect of Water "},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"  The Prince of Cups is the Airy aspect of Wa ter. He can be interp reted as Understanding backed by Intelligence and Thought. He can also be interpreted as the energy of steam, water vaporized, capable of doing gr eat amounts of work if well di rected, but also capable of explosion if overly contained. (St eam power can also be rapidly a nd uselessly dissipated if not confined/retained and directed.) The Prince of Cups can also be seen as a crafty, sly, intelligent young man who can not be trusted, whose appearance is illusory. Which interpretation is correct? You will have to determine this from the context of each layout, and from the evidence supplied by your Higher Self. As should now be obvious, a card with one meaning in today's reading can have a very different meaning in tomorrow's reading. Keep in mind that each element is composed of two primal forces. These primal forces are hot or cold, and dry or wet. (32) Fire is hot and dry, Air is hot and wet, Earth is cold and dry, and Water is cold and wet. The court cards allow the emphasis to be placed on on e primal force, to be balanced between two primal forces, or to be balanced between all four primal forces. Knight of Swords Fiery aspect of Air Queen of Swords Watery aspect of Air Prince of Swords Airy aspect of Air Princess of Swords Earthy aspect of Air Knight of Disks Fiery aspect of Earth Queen of Disks Watery aspect of Earth Prince of Disks Airy aspect of Earth Princess of Disks Earthy aspect of Earth Table 2: Alchemical Sub-elemental Correspondences of the Court Cards"},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"The Prince of Swords, the Airy aspect of Air, represents purified hot and wet essences. The Knight of Swords, the Fiery aspect of Air, places an emphasis on hot (combining hot/dry with hot/wet). The Prince of Disks ba lances all four forces (combi ning hot/wet with cold/dry). The Knight of Swords might be tied to the Princess of Disks in a layout, linking a hot/dry and hot/wet combination to a cold/dry and cold/wet combination. This conj unction will balance all four elements and all four primal forces. Numbered cards can also help stress or bala nce elemental effects or the influence of the primal forces. Examine your layouts, looking for concentrations and tren ds within the four suits. Are the elements/suits ba lanced? Or does one element or primal force exert an undue influence within the layout as dealt? Don't forget the Trumps. Do their alchemical in fluences affect the balance of the layout? Alchemy appears scattered among the Trumps as well. Trumps II, III, and IV (Priestess, Empress, and Emperor) make up an alchemical triad, Mercury, Salt, and Sulphur. Atu XIV, Art, presents an advanced stage of Alchemy and alchemist. Other references will be found during advanced study into the Tarot. 30 Author's note: This commendment doesn't seem to carry much weight. In the four years which have passed between this primer's initial printing and thie first revision / reprinting, many Setians have continued on past this point without first reading up on Alchemy. I'm not that a good writer, but some Setians just can't seem to put this primer down, at least not here where I'm finally getti ng to some \"meat\". If you aren't already familiar with alchemy and you do have a good introduction handy, please do read it now. If it's not handy, well, you can continue reading (you were going to anyway - I can't st op you), but please do read that alchemical introduction as soon as you can. 31 This table is from Chapter 2, The Tarot and the Holy Quabalah , of Crowley's The Book of Thoth . 32 These are the primal forces represented by Shu (Hot and Dry) and Tefnut (Cold and Wet). Lesson 5 – Numerology Numerology can be a very significant help to understanding the symbolism held by the Tarot cards, and you should understa nd at least the basic princi ples of Numerology before attempting to go any further in this Primer. Like with Alchemy in the previous chapter, the most readily available intr oduction is probably found in Cavendish's The Black Arts . Learn enough so that you know the basic meani ngs of numbers one through ten. Learn also of the basic cycles that are important to Numerology. Another introduction which you should read if you are not yet familiar with Numerology is A View of Numerology . (33) It presents a shorte r introduction to Numerol ogy, from a Setian point of view. Again, like with Alchemy, if you need this basic orientation in Numerol ogy, please read those introductions now. This primer will not attempt to give you the grounding you'll need in Numerology to become skilled Tarot readers. * * * *"},{"pageNumber":974,"pageContent":"I mentioned A View of Numerology above. A primary considerat ion/conclusion within that article is that Numerology is a science of coincidence. Coincidence can be used by a reader to in crease a reading's impact upon a querant. Analyze the number of the querant's name (and birthda y, if you wish), or analyze the number of the key word within the question. Does that numbe r appear repeated th roughout the reading? Does it appear echoed by one or more significan t cards? If so, point th is out to the querant, not as coincidence but as evidence of how the reading applies to the question. The creative Magician can use coincidences in many ways. Allow yourself to look for such numerological coincidences, and you will have more freedom to receive pointers from your Higher Self. Use coincidence that your Higher Self says is valid (valid coincidences are useful correspondences, whose usefulness is i ndependent of the coincidence). Remember that Numerology is what you make of it. Let's look at the Numerological analysis of two related words ... \"Xeper\" = 24 + 5 + 16 + 5 + 18 = 68 = 14 = 5 \"Khepher\" = 11 + 8 + 5 + 16 + 8 + 5 + 18 = 71 = 8 Numerology can not tell us wh ich spelling is \"correct\". (34) Numerology can help us place symbolism into a word. We can express different ideas (at least to ourselves) by choosing different spellings. \"Xep er\" = 68 = 5 appears passive (the first sum, 68, is even), but is actually and essentially ac tive (the final sum, 5, is odd). \"Khepher\" = 71 = 8 appears active, but is essentially passive. * * * * Such analyses of words or names is peripheral to the use of Numerology within the Tarot. Our primary concern is in applying numerological pr inciples to the numbers of the cards which appear within the layout. Numerology's primary correlation to the Tarot lies in the ten numbered cards within each suit, involving numerological correspondences for th e numbers borne on the cards. Each such card's meaning depends upon its suit and upon th e numerological meanings of its number. Table 3 below summarizes the numerologica l interpretations presented by Cavendish. (35) All Aces (ones) represent the seed or neter of an idea, the idea represented by the suit of the card, the original essence of the suit. The Ace of Wands represents the {idea, ideal, absolute, or neter} of {Thelema, will, energy, and acti on}. The Ace of Swords represents the idea, ideal, absolute, or neter of Thought and Intelligence. Alternately, the Ace can reflect originality in the area represented by the suit, determination within the suit, or one-track ed pursuit of principles i nherent within the suit. The Four represents the end of the first numer ological cycle, since 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 1. Four also represents a physical manifestati on of the creation symbolized by the Three."},{"pageNumber":975,"pageContent":"Hence the Four of Swords represents a Truce, an intellectual resti ng period, between the initial, purely mental activity of the first se veral cards and the more concrete activity of the remaining cards in the suit. Five represents the beginning of the next cycle, ended by 9. Ten starts the next cycle (10 = 1). Cavendish does not properly discuss the 10, which is often reduced to 1 in numerological studies. But since the Tarot deals with ten cards, we need to provide a numerological meani ng for the 10 of each suit. Just as the One and Five repres ent the start of the first and second numerological cycles, the Ten represents the start of the third cycle. This new cycle may be 10, 11, 12, etc., or 10, 20, 30, etc. (The advanced student in Numerology can find benefit in studying both classes of cycles.) The Ten of each suit can therefore represent a launching into new, more advanced, more complex areas of activity. It could also indicate the start, or presence, or consideration of a different order of magnitude. Similar activities can be applie d to the twenty-two Trumps. Note that there is no numerological interpreta tion of the Fool (numbered zero), nor a ready numerological interpretation of Atu XII through XXI. While we can examine these cards numerologically, our interpretations will of ten tend to follow kaballistic lines. You will find that the Kaballah and Numerol ogy present different and often contradictory interpretations of the numbered cards. This can cause difficulties for the beginning student. In some readings you will need the kabbalistic in terpretation of a card, a nd in others you will need the numerological interpretation."},{"pageNumber":976,"pageContent":" Practice, and the development of your Sense of Ma'at, will let you determine when to use the numerological interpretation and when to use th e kaballistic interpretation. Until then, all you can do is examine interpretations and see which one fits best. Much of Cavendish's discussion on Numerol ogy centers on analyzing personal attributes, starting from a person's name. In tarot readings we are primarily concerned with abstract ideas and attributes. We apply numerol ogical interpretations to the card s so we may arrive at those ideas and attributes. Example: As discussed above in our brief disc ussion of Xeper, even cards will tend toimply passivity, inaction, or stasis, while odd cards will imply action or change. * * * * While studying Numerology (or any occult philos ophy), realize that some interpretations will need to be upgraded to reflect the current ae on, and may need to be changed to account for the specific reader, quera nt, or question. Cavendish reports the popular a nd traditional opinion that ev en numbers are evil, while odd numbers are good, following the example of the On e (god) and Two (devil). Our patron Set (0 19 + 5 + 20 = 44 = 11 X 2 2 ) is even. Yes, most of the worl d would consider Set evil (if they could comprehend him at all). We don't.

Table 3: Traditional Numerological Symbology"},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"The primer will concentrate on using numerological interpretations that are appropriate to the Querant, Question, and Reader. These interpreta tions will often differ from those found in Table 3. Numbers can also take on personal meanings. Two is the number of opposition, od opposites, and Shu is a god of Opposition in Balance. The Two is therefore a very positive card for me, whileit would be less so for other magician s with other personal characteristics. * * * * Many layouts end themselves to an analysis of ca rd combinations (eg: pairs, triplets, etc.) Let us suppose we found a triplet (thr ee cards) consisting of the Thre e of Swords, Five of Wands and Seven of Disks. How could we interpret this triplet? The Three of Swords represents mental creation/creativity. (37) It is a pure activity, within the first cycle (1-4). The Five of Wands represen ts active pursuit of creation. (38) The Five is the physical mirror of the ethereal Three, generating fairly concrete results. This generation/creation is actively pursued, as shown by the Wands. The Seven of Disks represents cyclical behavior, in the realm of the Earth. (39) Cycles could oscillate from good to bad and back, or from male to female and back, or in many other ways, but this triplet seems instead to cycle between mental creativity (the Th ree of Swords), active physical creation (the Five of Wands) and pe riods of rest (the Seven of Disks). These periods of \"rest\" are not very restful, since all the card s are odd/active, but the Seven of Disks (by its suit) indicates a more restful period than will be experienced during phases controlled by the other two cards. Let us now attempt to put these three cards together, to analyze the triplet. One often rests because of one's accomplishment, and this accomplishment seems to be of the Earth. The cycles may reflect the Querant's career, with periods of ment al activity followed by physical creation, followed by a cusp - a promo tion and/or raise, followed by a period of growing comfortable with the ne w position, before starting the cycl e over again in search of the next promotion. Note that this analysis has i gnored the \"meaning\" written on th e cards, working strictly from the numerological and alchemical symbolism of th e selected cards. Both the Five of Wands and the Seven of Disks have relatively undesira ble names within the Book of Thoth, and yet your interpretation is extremely positive. You need to be able to recognize the symbolism i nherent within the cards, and read those. Use the names of the cards when they help your reading, but be free to throw the names away when they do not apply. 33 By Priest Robert Menschel, Scroll of Set , X.1, February-March XIX. 34 I use a modern English system of Numerology, in which letters A through Z in order represent / are represented by the numbers 1 through 26 in direct correspondence with the alphabet. F eel free to use whatever system of Numerology works for you. Realize that I shall be using the above system throughout this primer."},{"pageNumber":978,"pageContent":"35 This table is primarily from the text of Fortunes by Numbers in Cavendish's The Black Arts . 36 The Two represents the Devil who would rather Rule in Hell than serve in Heaven. I consider this Independence to be a great Good, as opposed to the one-tracked mindlessness of the One. 37 Swords imply mental activity or attributes, while the Three implies creation or creativity. 38 Wands imply activity, while the Five implies creation. 39 The Seven implies cyclical behavior, while the Disks repr esents the element or realm of the Earth, solidity and physical things. Lesson 6 - The Kaballah Many Setians are already familiar with the Kaballah, especially those with O.T.O. or other Thelemic backgrounds. Others however, have had little or no exposure to the Kaballah, and many of those have no interest in the Kaballah. Both positions are OK, but many Tarot decks, es pecially the Book of Th oth, are heavily laden with symbolism taken from the Kaballah. And ev en if Kaballic symbolism isn't painted onto the cards, the symbolism inherent in the numbers of the cards is useful to the initiated reader. We therefore direct those who are not yet familiar with the Kaballah to read some introduction on it. (40) Learn enough about the Kaballah so that you kno w the basic relations between the various sephiroth and the paths between them. You should also learn the more basic and common symbolism connected with the sephiroth and paths. The rest of this primer will assume that you have this basic knowledge. If this is your first exposure to either the Kaballah or the Tarot, you may be wondering about the coincidences involving two numbers. The Kaballah has ten sephiroth, and the Tarot has ten numbered cards in each suit. The Kaballa h has 22 paths between the sephiroth, and the Tarot has 22 trumps. Wonder no more. These are not coincidences, but correspondences intentionally designed into the Tarot. The Tarot has been shaped to enable it to reflect kaballistic symbolism. The Kaballah is an ancient and complex subject of study, which has accumulated layers of theory, speculation, and tradition for centuries. So much has been written about the Kaballah over the ages that much kaballistic knowle dge has been buried under piles of drivel. The Tarot is much more recent, having stabi lized only in the last 150 years. While much drivel has certainly been written about the Tarot as well, very little of that drivel has achieved the historic status that ka ballistic writings possess. It's easier to detect and ignore metaphysical hogwash concerning the Tarot. Further, the Tarot is yet growing, as eviden ced by the 20th century Book of Thoth, and by work within the Temple of Set. The Tarot was intentionally designed around th e ten sephiroth and 22 paths between the sephiroth, and the success of the Tarot st ems partly from these correspondences."},{"pageNumber":979,"pageContent":"These latter correspond ences are shown in The Tarot - General Attribution (plate # XXVIII) in The Book of Thoth (41) . Other tables of correspondences have been published elsewhere, but Crowley's appears to be the most wi dely accepted and most \"accurate\". Table 4 below illustrates the correspondences of the numbered tarot cards to the sephiroth of the Kaballah. (42) Using this table, let us now look again at the triplet of th e Three of Swords, Five of Wands, and Seven of Disks. How coul d we interpret this triplet using kaballistic symbolism? Three of Swords: Binah is the mother of matter, of physical creation. Binah is also Understanding. Binah is potential, in ert, passive, but powerful. This card reflects not a lack of activity, a negative qualit y, but rather a positive inactivity, a period devo ted to purely mental creation.

Geburah is the active daughter of Binah, who destroys the old and worthless, to make room for new creation. Emphasized by the activity of Wand s, this card is extremely, perhaps excessively active, preparing the way for later creation. Seven of Disks: Netzach is Vi ctory, firmness, the \"refulgent splendour of the intellectual virtues which are perceived by the eyes of the intellect.\" Ms. Fortune also says, Every life or form of force manifesting in Netzach is a partial but specialised [sic] manifestation; therefore no being that has for its sphere of evolution the sphere of Netzach can ever have an all-round development, but must always be a creature of one idea, one single, simple, stereotyped function. The Seven of Disks therefore finally illustrate s the active creation prepared by the Three of Swords and the Five of Wands, a brilliant in tellectual creation of so mething which has one and only one purpose. (44) That purpose lies in the realm of the Earth (45) (also remember that Binah is the mother of matter ). This triplet therefore reflects a creation of genius, a creation for an Earthly purpose. This creation occurs only after a period of quiet co ntemplation and preparation, and by a period of extremely active and deliberate elimination of everything that would interfere with this creation. How does this relate to our earlier interpretation, which used numerological symbolism? Numerologically, the Three of Swords represen ts mental creation/creativity. The Kaballah tells us that this mental creativity is quiet, potential, without any visible activity to even indicate its existence. Numerologically, the Five of Wa nds represents an active pursuit of creation, gene rating fairly concrete results. The Kaballah tells us that this active pursuit is not creation itself, but instead a form of destruction, a clean ing up, a preparation for the actual creation to follow. Numerologically, the Seven of Di sks represents cyclical behavi or, in the element of Earth. The Kaballah shows this to be the card of act ual creation. This triplet reveals a cycle between hidden mental creativity (Three of Swords), ac tive physical preparation for creation (Five of Wands), followed by periods of brilli ant creation (Seven of Disks). Our numerological interpretation in Lesson 5 sa w the actual creation in the Five of Wands, and saw the Seven of Disks as reflecting the pe riods of rest. We see now that there is no period of rest. The most restful period is that of the Three of Swords, where Binah's creation is potential, not actual. The phys ical activity we thought was cr eation in Lesson 5 was actually just preparation. The true creation was mental, as shown by the kaballis tic interpretation of the Seven of Disks aided by the Three of Swords. Table 5 below presents Crowley's corresponden ces between the Atu and the paths between the sephiroth, (46) which will be used throughout this primer. (47) Table 4: Correspondences between Kaballisti c Sephiroth and the Numbered Tarot Cards"},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"By these correspondences, the Atu absorb m eaning not only from th eir position on the Tree (vertical and horizontal), but also from the sephiroth that they connect. Let us examine some of these corresponden ces, so you will recognize them in later discussions. Atu V, The Hierophant, is high on the Tree, and connects the cente r and right pillars. It is a quite spiritual car d, with strong activ e/male tendencies. (48) This path connects Chokmah and Chesed, the second and fourth sephir oth, the creative and the material. Atu VII, the Chariot, connects Binah (3) and Geburah (5), Understand ing and Strength. Its position on the left pillar indicate s that much of its influence a nd import is passive, rather than active. Note that the four sphinxes which dr aw the chariot are not moving. In Crowley's discussion of this Trump, the only active motion is that of the rays within the Grail. This card is Potential. Atu IV, the Emperor, connects Netzach (7) a nd Yesod (9), Occult Intelligence and Pure Intelligence. Like path 5 above, it connects the right and center pillars, but is much lower on the tree, with much more physical/mundane impo rt. The Emperor is regal and noble, but very active and interested in the world. This is the card of practical magic. 40 Again, you may find that avendish's The Black Arts contains such a suitable introduction. A more thorough examination is found in Dion Fortune's The Mystical Quabalah , not on the Temple of Set Reading List. This latter book is a solid example of a work from the Aeon of Horus, and the Setian reader needs to apply our more modern perspective to its content. 41 See Table 5 on page 30. 42 This table summarizes the symbology described in Dion Fortune's The Mystical Quabalah . 43 Again, the Swords imply mental activ ity, and the Three implies creation. 44 as implied by the Seven. 45 as shown by the Disks. 46 This table is adapted from Crowley's diagram in The Book of Thoth entitled The Tarot - General Attribution (plate # XXVIII). The version in Wassermann' s instruction booklet may be easier to read. 47 While the author Feels that the progre ssion of the aeons requires some change to this table of correspondences, he is not yet prepared to present th ese changes.

Every single one claims that the ancient knowledge of Astrology is imbedded within the Tarot. I copied that claim into the Scroll of Set article from which the Intr oduction is derived.

I asked Setian Astrologe rs for help, but they were too unfamiliar with the Tarot. I asked other Setian scholars of th e Tarot, but they were too unfamiliar with Astrology. So I ended up studying Astrology to try to find c onnections between it and the Tarot. I studied several respected a nd seemingly reasonable treatise s concerning the two schools of knowledge and their inter-rela tionships, and have had to reject them all. It is my opinion, following this study, that astrol ogical symbolism within the Tarot falls into three classes: fanciful, derivative, and imposed. Fanciful applications are those wh ere the relationship between Astrology and the Tarot is based on wishful thinking. One prime example of such wishful thinking is the supposed relationship of the four suits to the four seasons, found in Glen Wayne Dixon's analysis, in Peter Balin's The Flight of the Feathered Serpent . The theory is nice, but falls apart under extensive analysis. Derivative applications are those where the relati onship between Astrology and the Tarot is based upon a third symbolism. This is the method Crowley uses, as evidenced by his statement, \"The only theory of ultimate interest about the Tarot is that it is an admirable symbolic picture of the Universe, base d on the data of the Holy Qabalah.\" Imposed symbolism has been discussed in my own writings, primarily A View of Numerology (The Scroll of Set X.1) and Remanifestation; a Symbolic Synthesis (Ruby Tablet ). Imposed symbolism is that symbolism placed upon an obj ect of study by the student, rather than symbolism extracted from the object of study. Some readers of this primer will be Astrologers with little or no bac kground in the Kaballah. You may find the astrological symbolism mentioned in the B ook of Thoth more enlightening than the kaballistic symbolism. Unfortunately, as little as I \"know\" about the Kaballah, I know less about Astrology. This primer will not make any significant use of nor comment upon the astrological symbolism within the Book of Thoth. Perhaps someday an Astrologer will come forward to help in this area... Lesson 8 – Sex (and related topics) Now that I have your attention ... :-) Some of the cards within th e Tarot are obviously sexually or iented; they include sexual symbolism. Some cards picture people (singly or otherwise). All of the cards have some sexual or personal application. Alchemical correspondences within the Tarot ca n point to some of these sexually oriented symbolism. Remember that Wands (Fire) and Swords (Air) are mascu line suits, representing"},{"pageNumber":984,"pageContent":"masculine elements with masculine characterist ics, while Cups (Water) and Disks (Earth) are considered feminine suits, w ith feminine characteristics. This symbolism relies heavily upon our social archetypes, stereotypes, and traditions. \"Men of action\" and scholars have traditionally been males, while females have traditionally been considered more emotional and supp orting/supportive types of people. As with any social tradition, these relations hips are subject to change. These symbolic relationships will be more accurate (or less accura te) in one area of the globe as compared to another, and will change from one year to anot her. Within Setian arenas these relationships may not hold at all. The tarot reader must repeatedly answer the ques tion, \"Is this court card an ideal or archetype, or is this card a person?\" And if the latter, then when is the person represented or identified by the physical (sexual or bodily) characteristics of the court card? Or when is that person represented by the archetypica l (personality) characteristics of the court card? Court cards represent people more often than other cards do. When they do so, Knights are mature and/or older men, while Princes ar e immature and/or younger men. Queens are mature/older females, while Princesses are immature/younger women or girls. Following these patterns of correspondence, the Kn ight of Cups might be an older, mature male, who demonstrates, shows, or feels emo tion (most likely for the querant). The Princess of Swords might be a flight y, younger woman, perhaps involved in some mental pursuit with the querant. The Knight of Cups could also represent a strong and willful, mature female, a woman who holds her own in a man's world. The Princess of Swords can symbolize a younger, feminine man, a quiet scholar with no interest in sports, perhaps very passive and/or easily dominated by the more forceful members of either sex. The Prince of Cups and Knight of Cups could bo th appear in the same reading, in different areas of the layout. The two might then both refl ect the same man, but two different aspects of him. The Prince would reflect the less mature aspects, those likely to cause problems in a relationship, while the Knight would reflect the more mature aspects, more supportive, which point to and support a long-term relationship. A court card could also be archetypical, poin ting towards personal characteristics rather than the actual sex of any person. The Queen of Wands (the Watery as pect of Fire) might represent the emotional powers and forces which give st rength to the Fire of one's Thelema during psychodramatic ritual. More physically, this Qu een could represent emo tions on a rampage. This Queen could also represent some person, male or female, young or old, who is extremely active and energetic (Wands), and whose activity reflects \"her\" emotional being (Queen). This Queen may fly off the handle a lot, or may go to extreme lengths to do favors for a close friend. Similarly, several Trumps may reflect archet ypes or people, depending upon the reading. The Priestess may sometimes reflect a young, pure-so uled woman. She may reflect instead the archetypical ideal of dedication to a philosophy, belief, or idea."},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"From your numerological studies, you should by now know that all odd numbers (one, three, ... nine) are considered to be male, while even nu mbers (two, four, ... ten) are considered to be female. This applies mostly to the numbered su it cards, but with care can also be applied to the Trumps. The numbered suit cards will rarely reflect an individual or a group of people, but the sexual symbolism of that number (and suit) will often give the reader an idea of any sexually oriented qualities of the activ ity or question involved. If a Queen of Wands is surrounded by even car ds (feminine, passive), then this will sometimes be interpreted to actually represent a woman, a female, with fiery leanings. If those even cards are 4 and 8, that lady is outwardly quiet and passive, quite feminine, and quite possibly intensely frustrated becau se her spirit wars with her outward image. If those even cards are 2 and 10, that lady is probably know n to be quite active, perhaps almost masculine. (49) As may be obvious by these examples, it can be very difficult to determine whether, in any given reading, a card represents a person, or whether that card re presents an idea. And if the card represents a person, does the card indicate the actual sex of the pe rson, or a quality of that person, or maybe the person's personality? There is no simple, rote way to know this. With practice, and with development of your Sense of Ma'at, you'll eventually be able to tell the difference. Until then, recognize the possibilities, and leave your options (and mind) open. Some Tarot readers will sometime s relate the individual cards to individual parts or organs of the body. One such method is through the ka ballistic corresponden ces, where the Aces (Kether) relate to the head, the tens (Malkuth) relate to the feet, etc. Rarely will such relations be of any importa nce to us. The interested student can examine Dion Fortune's The Mystical Qabalah for information about such relationships. There are other methods of relating selected ca rds to parts of the body. Some are specific to the cards themselves, and others use correspond ences other than the Kaballah. Since these relationships of cards to body are so rarely useful, we will not de lve into them any further in this lesson. The interested and experienced student will be able to find these relationships with a little scholarly and magical work. Some readers also try to convert the symbols within th e Tarot into periods of time, using them to determine the number of days, weeks, months, or years until something happens. (Astrological symbolism is sometimes used here.) Rarely will any such direct relationship be possible. Always be careful when attempting to calculate a specific period of time for any prediction. 49 The 2 and 10 are more active numbers than 4 and 8. "},{"pageNumber":986,"pageContent":"Lesson 9 – Recording a Layout Mankind has used spoken languages for tens of thous ands of years. And for tens of thousands of years, Man was a primitive hunter, unable to advance past superstitious response to the environment, or past rote memorization of what little knowledge could be handed down from generation to generation. Man invented written language less than ten t housand years ago. This enabled him to record history, facts, and knowledge, and to pass that knowledge and information on to others, without requiring rote memorization. Written language also enabled Man to work with knowledge too complex to be memorized. Written language allows us to devote mental energy to thinking about our knowledge and lives, rather than trying to memorize this knowledge. Tarot is a language, and we can benefit from r ecording our important r eadings for continued and extended study. We can benefit from a written language, whose messages are fixed (unlike the cards, which are repeatedly shuffled ). We can benefit from sharing our readings with others, who are not present at the time of the initial reading. This written language needs to repr esent several parts of a reading: • the Question - Why is this reading being performed? • the Cards - Which cards were selected? • the Layout - How were the cards la id out, and in which order? • What does the order add to the reading? • the Reading - What has been determined from all this? All of this could be written in relatively st raight-forward language (eg: English). We can quote the question, list the cards, de scribe the layout, and record the reading. This is exactly what we do. However, the process of recordi ng (and rereading) the cards and layout can be assisted (made easier) with a little effort. In th is lesson we examine the methods we can use to improve or simplify the process of recording and rereading the layout. The question and the reading are transcribed in English, since that is the language we use to ask the question and in which we perform the reading. (50) The layout and cards are the symbolic language of the Tarot, and are often better represented by symbols rather than by words. We can list the cards in several ways. Regard less of the actual met hod used, I have found it highly useful to always list the suit, number, a nd name of each card. This enables us to more easily review the symbolism of each card from the written record. It also helps us to find and fix errors in the written records, as we disc uss later. Hence, the lis t in the first box below might be used to record six cards used in a reading. 3 of Swords - Sorrow 4 of Disks - Power Queen of Disks XI - Lust"},{"pageNumber":987,"pageContent":" This list takes up a significant amount of room on paper (it would take up much more room for large readings with many cards), and we can shrink that list , use less paper, by abbreviating much of the list. The same lis t could be written as shown on the left. Layouts also have meaning or importance in the po sition of the cards and in their order. In the small booklet included with the Book of Thoth deck we find a layout which uses fifteen cards, graphically shown below. 13 9 5 -- 4 8 12 2 1 3 14 10 6 -- 7 11 15 Note that the third chart show s the order and position of each card. The recording of the cards and the layout can be combined into one chart, as in Figure 1 and Fi gure 2 on the next page. Those charts should give you a fair comprehensi on of the cards which were laid out, in which order, and where in the layout the cards were placed. Now it is time to discuss some of the abbreviations I've used in recordin g the cards. All of the applicable symbolism is recorded in Figure 1 and Figure 2, and youi should refer to them in the following discussion. We use a simple form of notation: • All cards are indicated by number, suit, and name (if any), in that order. • Trumps are numbered using capitalized Ro man numerals, while numbered suit cards are numbered in Arabic numerals (this is the same method used on the tops of the cards themselves). I personally prefer to reco rd the Aces with 'A', as in \"A.D\" for the Ace of Disks, but \"1.D\" would be equally suitable and understandable. • Court cards are \"numbered\" by a bbreviating their personages: • K - Knight • Q - Queen • Pm - Prince • Pf - Princess m (male) and f (female) are used to differentiate between the Prince and the Princess. • Suits are abbreviated: W - Wands C - Cups S - Swords D - Disks The numbered suit cards and Trumps have name s as well as numbers. We include those names in the recording. This helps to remind us of the name and symbolism of the cards when we later reread the record (or wh en others read the record). We often don't have the cards laid XXI - The Universe Ace of Cups 3.S - Sorrow XI - Lust 4.D - Power XXI - Universe Q.D A.C"},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"out before us at that later time, and so the names can help us \"read\" the cards, giving more meaning than just the cards' numbers. Recording the name as well as number also helps us verify the recording, since we know an error has been made in transcription if the name does not match the number. Indeed, we can correct many such errors because we record the names as well as numbers. If a recording lists \"2.S - Dominion\", we can correct this to \"2.W\", be ing fairly sure that only the suit was recorded in error. The single mistake is much more likely th an the double mistake of recording both number and name incorrectly. Figure 1 gives both a list of cards and a diagra m of the layout.Figure 2 includes the list of cards in a diagram of the layout, and we often use th is format when the layout will be actively studied for a while, and when we wish to avoid having to mentally merge the two.

The common use of the Wasserman Layout il lustrated by Figure 1 and Figure 2 gives meaning to the position of each group of cards.

Lesson 10 – The Vocabulary You have now been introduced to the Tarot. Looking at the Book of Thoth as a language, you have learned that this langua ge has its parts of speech, its conjugations, and its grammars. You have seen the sh ape of its letters. Now you shall work on your vocabul ary; you shall learn the words we use in this language. This is both the most tedious and the most challenging part of learning the Tarot. Just as you never finish learning the voca bulary of your native language, you will never finish learning the vocabulary of the Tarot. Crowley's textual Book of Thoth is currently the best dictiona ry for this language. While this primer will discuss many cards, it will not do so in any organized system, card by card. Nor will it be complete. We will rely on Crowley's te xt to be your dictionary to this language. Take the time to read the textual Book of Thoth cover to cover. Realize that this text is a dictionary; do not attempt to memorize this dict ionary. The only way to learn a vocabulary is to use it. But do try to absorb as much of th e patterns, trends, and symbolism as possible. Remember also that the Book of Thoth is itself incomplete. Crow ley described much of the symbolism of the Book of Thoth, but could not textually examine all of it. Further, as discussed in earlier lessons, some of the sym bolism has changed since the Book of Thoth was written, and other symbolism is pe rsonal, varying from querant to querant, or reader to reader. The Book of Thoth is a necessary reference, but you will need to supplement this text with your own knowledge and experience. The Book of Thoth can be very difficult to read. Many Setians (including th is author) have needed several tries to complete their first read ing of the text. Keep at it until you have read 10.S - 13 - Ruin A.D - 9 7.W - 5 - Valour 8.C - 4 - Indolence Pm.S - 8 8.D - 12 - Prudence 3.D - 2 - Works 2.C - 1- Love XIV - 3 - Art XI - 14 - Lust Q.W - 10 10.W - 6 - Oppression 9.D - 7 - Gain 8.S - 11 - Interference Pf.S - 15 Figure 2: Sample Recorded Layout, by Position"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"the entire text at least once, a nd know how to find the descripti ons and analyses that apply to each card. Then feel free to reread the Book of Thoth several times, as you progress through this primer. You will find that you learn more about the Ta rot and its symbolism each time you read the text. Read the text once now, before continuing to th e next lesson. The remainder of this primer will assume you have read the text, know about the patterns inherent in the Tarot, and know how to find the definitions (the descriptions) of any specific card or any group of cards. This primer will not by itself teach you the vocabulary of the Tarot. Several of the cards are examined, but we by no means will examine all cards. You can only learn the language of the tarot by reading the text , and from practice. Lesson 11 – The Wasserman Layout Recognizing that many people will buy tarot car ds without first reading books on the Tarot, publishers often include a small booklet in the bo x that contains the tarot deck. This booklet contains a very basic level of instruction. The booklet distributed with th e Book of Thoth contains instructions by James Wasserman, including a description of a layout which has proven very usef ul to many Setians. For lack of a better title, we can cal l this the Wasserman Layout. (52) This layout was first presented in Lesson 9, and is reproduced here in Figure 3. This layout is most useful for questions which ask about the future, about choices to be made, and about the results of those choices. Read that booklet, its description of the layout, and the use of the layout now, before continuing with this Lesson. Please read that description of the layout now . Continue reading this primer when you have completed that assignment. * * * * The most difficult part of learning to read Taro t is learning to interpret the cards. Books on the Tarot devote the great majority of their pages to describing the cards an d their symbolism, and spend few if any of their pages s howing how to interpret a layout. 13 9 5 4 8 12 2 1 3 14 10 6 7 11 15 Figure 3: Wasserman Layout Diagram"},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"This primer will concentrate on interpreting layo uts. This chapter introduces you to a reading in which we use the Wasserman Layout. The next several will then inte rpret that layout. * * * * Scenario: you are reading for a friend (male, la te 20's), who is considering changing jobs. This friend is currently working in a satisfactory job, where he could stay, bu t he is not ecstatic about that current job. Your friend has been offered a new job with a different company, a job which seems to offer much better opportunities and chal lenges. But like any unknown, this new job may also result in higher levels of frustration and unhappiness. Should your friend change jobs? We will use the Wasserman Layout because this que stion looks at the future (and because this layout is the subject of this lesson). We will lay out 15 cards in five groups of three, in the order shown. In each three-card sectio n, the central card represents a cent ral aspect of the answer, and the other two cards will modify or expand upon that answer. • The central group (2-1-3 ) represents the ques tion, the querant's attitudes towards the question, and the current state of the querant's affairs as it relates to the question. • he lower left group (14-10-6) represents ps ychological, emotional, and other factors which affect the question and are internal to the querant. These can be changed through intensive effort, but should usually be considered fixed, since most people simply do not change. It is very important that we recognize the differences between impacts of this section on Setians vs impacts of this section on others. Most people will not be able to change their psychological factors. However, th e Setian must always ask whether these feelings and emotions are desirable; does th e Self need to grow from this state to another? • The lower right group (7-11-15) represents external factors and forces, ie: the environment, forces that are generally not under the querant's control or influence. • The upper right group (4-8-12) could represen t the near future, wh ile the upper left group (13-9-5) would represent the far future. The near future will occur as an almost automatic, almost unavoidable result of a decision (that decision may be for or agai nst the change, and the result would stem from either a \"for\" or \"again st\" decision). The far future is much more malleable, and may be viewed as a desirable goal that can be achieved through work, or a warning of a fate that can be avoided through work. It is generally very difficult to assign time frames to \"near\" and \"far\" futures. They may be days away or years away. Such determinations, when they are possible, depend heavily upon context, and often upon reasonable estimations based on factors outside the cards themselves."},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"Alternately, the two upper sec tions could point to different paths, branching off from this decision. The right hand pa th or section would indicate the future which results if your friend stays where he is. The left hand pa th or section indicates the future that becomes possible if your friend changes jobs. In some readings, only one of these options will apply. In others , you will decide in advance which of these options you wish to use. For this reading, we will decide which way to use these upper sections after the cards have been laid out. Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, no card in any group will modify or affect the meaning of any card in a different group. We will not use inverted cards (cards that are laid out upside-down by the deal). (53) This is your first reading, and we will fo llow a method of card sele ction common to most early readings. You shuffle the cards, raising your Higher Self, while your friend (the querant) concentrates on his question. Your friend cuts the deck once, and then you deal the fifteen cards in order off the top of the deck. The cards you deal are listed in Figure 4 above , and also in Figure 5. Since we are not using inverse cards, you turn all cards ri ght-side up as they are dealt. 1. 3.S Sorrow 2. 4.D Power 3. Q.D 4. 10.S Ruin 5. 8.D Prudence 6.

The remainder of this lesson (and the next several lessons) will assume you have these cards laid out in front of you. Also, when reading for others, \"right-side up\" will usually mean so the querant can read the names of the cards. The cards will be upside-down for you. Lesson 2 mentioned how you should practice shuff ling the cards, so you can look experienced and feel comfortable during the reading. You should also practice r eading the cards upside- down, so that you are comfortabl e reading with the cards betw een yourself and a querant who faces you. (The cards should be right-side up to th e querant.) Don't attempt this now, for this first layout, but do practice reading upside-down from time to time. Look for obvious patterns in the cards. We gene rally look for Trumps first, and we can see that there are only two Atu in this layout, XI and XXI. The \"average\" layout will have four to five Trumps. This might be interpreted as m eaning that the question and/or answer are not very complex (the Atu having the appearance of being the more complex of the 78 Keys). There are two Wands, no Cups, five Swords, a nd six Disks . This indicates a very heavy involvement of Airy and Earthl y considerations and activity. There are but four court cards, and three of them are Queens. Since these Queens are found in the central and upper sections, the future (and pr esent) are affected by Watery considerations and influences. But these Watery considerations are subsidiary to those of Air and Earth, since there are no Cups in the layout, and no females in the lower sections. The numbered suit cards are somewhat balanced by number, with an Ace, Three, and Four balancing a pair of Tens, one Nine, and a pair of Eights. While the essential/spiritual is present (lower numbers) and must be considere d, there is a lot of m undane influence (higher numbers) in this reading. Just how significant is the fact that only tw o Trumps appear? No Cups? Six Disks? None of these characteristics are statistically very significant. (\"Statistically significant\" events are those that are extr emely rare, unlikely to occur in a random selection.

None of the trends noted above are statistically significant. Bu t tarot reading is a subjective art. You'll note through the next se veral lessons that these trends are significant, if only to this reading. Appendix 1 on page lists the probabilities for va rious combinations of cards in the Wasserman Layout (or in any 15-card layout). You'll note th at on average, one out of every ten 15-card layouts will have exactly two trumps. This then is a fairly common occurrence. The most common count of Trumps is four, fo llowed by 5, 3, 6, and then 2. Nine of every ten layouts will have between two and six trumps . In 100 layouts, you shoul d see layouts with anywhere from one to eight Trumps. If a layout has no Trumps, or has nine or more Trumps, that is statistically significant. Only one layout in 268 will fall outside the one-to-eight Trump range. How statistically significant is the di stribution of suits? Again, not very. Lay the cards out ten times, and chances are you'll have layouts w ith zero cards in some suit, and layouts with five or six car ds in one suit. Given a sample of 100 layouts, you should find many layouts which have between zero and seven cards from any given suit. However, only once in 585 layouts will eight or more of any one suit appear. If more than half of a 15-card layout is all one suit, that is statistically significant. This layout (the one we're working on) has five Cups and six Disks. While this is a rare occurrence (about 1.84%, or once in 54 layouts), it is not unusual enough to be statistically significant. I have not listed probabilities for many different repetitions of number s, since there are so many different possibilities. Note that of 15 cards, four will have identical numbers (one from each suit) approximately once every 80 layouts. Two sets of four will appear once every 347 layouts. Again, this layout has three Queen s, pairs of Tens and Eights, and many single cards. None of these is statistically significant. 52 This layout is also described in the book The Tarot of the Golden Dawn , by Robert Wang (published by Weiser). The layout predates James Wasserman, but we ha ve been unable to identify a satisfactory name for the layout, or to credit any person or group with creation of this layout. We will therefore use the name \"Wasserman Layout\" until better information comes our way. 53 I personally never use inverted cards. "},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"Lesson 12 – Your First Reading, Central Section Now that the cards have been laid out as disc ussed in Lesson 11, and after the general analysis of trends with which we finished that less on, we are ready to anal yze the individual cards within the layout. We are rea dy to perform the reading. Concentrate first on the central group (4.D, 3.S, Q.D). Reread Crowley's description of these cards. Do so now, before continuing on with this lesson. You are familiar with the procedure by now. Read the section in Crowley's Book of Thoth which discusses these cards. Read not only th e section on the cards th emselves, but those on the general groups of cards (Four, Three, and Queen). Read those sections now, before you continue with this primer. This primer will discuss the cards within the reading, but you should read what Crowley says, so you can also see what we don't discuss. Four of Disks 3 Power Three of Swords 1 Sorrow Queen of Disks 2 The Three is a card of creation, according to both the kaballah (representing Binah) and numerology. This idea of creation is tinged with Sorrow. Crowley emphasizes the dark side of Binah and the Three's ka ballistic imbalance (being on the left, the evil side of the Tree of Life), in claiming Sorrow for the Three of Swords. Numerologically the Three is a very positive nu mber, and the other three 3's are very positive cards. We are able to accept Crowley's unhappy inte rpretation, since we know that the querant experiences some unhappiness in his present job. This is probably an intellectual sorrow, since the Swords represent the element of Air. This might be a specific, sharp (sword s), or individual sorrow, but it also might be a more general melancholy, as indicated by Crowley in hi s discussion on \"The Four Threes.\" This card indicates a state of dissatisfaction, and the source of the querant's question. The Four represents a physical manifesta tion, again both by the ka ballah (Chesed) and numerology. Physical manifestation has take n place in the suit of Earth. A cycle has completed successfully, and the results of that cycle are a fortress within which the querant has been and/or is re sting, rebuilding his strength and resources. The querant rests in apparent physic al comfort, earthly comfort. These cards together indicate that the (intell ectual) Sorrow or melancholy experienced by the querant may be related to the Earth and/ or to the passive st ate of the Four."},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"The querant may be comfortabl e, but wondering, \"Is this enou gh? Should I be doing more?\" Such questions are being asked me ntally, but the absence of Wands in this section shows that no serious action is being taken. These impressions are supported by the seated Qu een with her large sh ield and substantial armor, strengthening the presence of Earth in this central section. The Queen is very passive, enhancing and repeating the message of the Four's unchanging fortress. She is a mothering influence, offering to care for the que rant, apparently in his current job. By representing Water, she also indicates emotional conflict stirred by the intellectual dissatisfaction. I interpret this section to indicate that the que rant's current job is adequately lucrative and comfortable. It meets his munda ne, financial, earthly needs. But it does not challenge the querant's intelligence; it does not o ffer much opportunity for creation. The job is comfortable and c onstant, not offering much opport unity for growth and change. While the querant appreciates the Earthly rewards of this job, he is somewhat dissatisfied with its lack of opportunity. That is why he is consideri ng the new job offer, and why he asks his question. As indicated by the Queen, the question has beco me more than intellectual, and is now an emotional problem for the querant. The questi on has become emotionally important for the querant, much more than an intellectual query would have been. This information should be relayed to the que rant. Much of it is already included in the question, and you may already know the rest. But a major part of reading is building the querant's confidence in the reading. By reading this information back to the quera nt, by explaining the symbolism of the cards, you indicate that the cards do respond to the question, and that they respond with valid and true information. This is also an opportunity for you and the quera nt to verify that th e reading is indeed answering the question. The querant may disagree with the analysis so far. He may report that his current job is intellectually challenging, and that the new j ob does not offer significantly more challenge. Instead, the new job may bring him closer to his family a nd emotional comfort (Cups). If he did, then the reading so far would be invalid. You will have occasional readings which are invalid, in which you have failed to raise your Higher Self into communication with your Active Self. You might redeal to try again, but the better course will generally be to simply apologize to the querant and offe r to try again some other day. Some querants will want and appreciate a full de scription of the message you perceive in the cards. Your words to them might sound very mu ch like the analysis I've written above. As you read the cards for these people y ou can effectively think out loud."},{"pageNumber":997,"pageContent":"Other querants want only their answer, and are bothered by too much verbiage. You will need to be succinct with these quera nts, and give them the minimal amount of analysis. Give them just enough to build their confid ence in the reading, and enough for you to verify the validity of the reading. Lesson 13 – Your First Reading, Next Section Let us assume that our reading is accurate so far. Which section do we interpret next? As a general rule of thumb, after the central section consider interp reting the psychological (lower left) section, and then the external (lower right) sect ion. In this fashion you can continue reading from the known (or veri fiable) into the unknown, the future, the unverifiable. But an equally important consideration is to r ead from the clear message to the unclear. If you have difficulty reading the psychol ogical and external sections, but the future is leaping out at you, jumping up and down and shouting its messa ge, then read the future first. Again, try to read near future (upper right) before th e (less certain) far future (upper left), unless the far future's clarity outwei ghs the temporal considerations. One final option: If you Feel it is more importa nt, or more advantageous to the reading, to discuss the sections in any particular order, do so. Scanning the four remaining sections, I find an important message in the psychological section (lower left), which stresses and emphasi zes the future. I therefore chose to read the external (lower right) section next, to allow me to build up to the important message in the psychological section, and to use that message to introduce the future. Concentrate now on that exte rnal, lower right group (9.D, XI, 10.W). Reread Crowley's description of these cards. Do so now, before continuing on with this lesson. Nine of Disks 7 Gain XI 11 Lust Ten of Wands 15 Oppression Rather than reading from the central card out, we 'll read this section fr om the outer cards in. This time, read the analysis not only to abso rb the symbolism and meaning, but also thinking about how you might offer this analysis to the querant. The Ten of Wands \"is Fire in its most destructive aspect.\" It symbolizes a force that is totally mundane, with no redeeming characteristics, for a ll such higher characteristics have been left behind in the Wands' travel down the Tree of Life."},{"pageNumber":998,"pageContent":"The Ten indicates the presence of an external pressure upon the querant, an oppressive force, pushing the querant in directi ons he'd rather not go. And, since this \"is a Will which has not unders tood anything beyond its dull purpose, its 'lust of result,'\" the direction is not a beneficial one. Other forces might push an unwilling querant in beneficial directions, helping the querant in spite of himself. Oppression does not point in any such beneficial direction, and can only harm the querant who bows to it. The Nine of Disks shows the direction of this pressure. The querant is being coerced to Gain, to advance himself, probably in his career (certainly in some Earthly realm). Numerologically, the Nine is a very positive number, reflecting magical situations and powers, reflecting completion, and be ing the square of the Three. In another reading this Nine could be a very positive card. But because of th e message we are reading, we throw away this numerological interpretation and concentrate on the kaballistic. This sephirah [the ninth, Yesod] is the seat of the great crysta llization of Energy. But it takes place very far down the tree. ... Each of thes e cards gives the full impact of the elemental force, but in its most material sense. In spite of the querant's own sa tisfaction with his job and career, he is being pressured to do \"better\". In middle-class white Am erica, in the 1980's, there is a lot of societal pressure to move up the corporate ladder, the chain of command, to take on more and more responsibility, more and mo re risk, in return for more and more reward. Your friend feels this societal pressure, and is distraught b ecause it does not match his own personal desires (as we shall see in the next section). The strength, the brute force of this pressure, is indicated by the central card of this section, Lust. This card can be most bene ficial in the lower left, intern al section, and most unpleasant when we find it here. Atu XI was called Strength in earlier decks. Crowley renamed and redesigned the card to reflect the advances within the Aeon of Horus. But in this reading we see a degeneration of Lust back to Strength, a degene ration of revelry a nd indulgence in one's Strength and quest into a forced march, with that force coming from the outside. Atu XI is not only Strength, but its energetic symbolism heavily invokes Fire, adding to the power of the 10.W. Note how this card's curre nt name, Lust, appears in the phrase \"lust of results\" used to describe the 10.W above. Lust's central position reflects the importance of the strength of this pressure upon the querant. The direction of this pressure is le ss important to the querant's question than the magnitude of the pressure. Any other direc tion would be equally bothersome, given an external pressure of this magnitude. Force this strong is probably not just applied by society in general, but is also being applied to the querant by people quite clos e to him. His family, frie nds, coworkers, and similar associates are probably exerting this pressure upon the querant. They may be telling him how he's \"wasting his talents\" in the current job, or how he should \"improve himself\"."},{"pageNumber":999,"pageContent":"These people are well intentione d, and mean to do well by the querant. But their pressure is causing the querant to feel a large amount of stress. Having completed this section's interpretation, no w is the time to verify this portion of the reading. Does the querant feel such pressure? In our sample the querant was probably nodding along, agreeing with the reader (you), as you described the meaning of the cards. Most pe ople would have recognized such obvious and strong pressure on their own, and others will r ecognize such activity once you bring it to their attention. But if you haven't gotten such confirmation, stop and ask the querant whether \"the cards\" are being accurate. If not, then you should stop here, a nd perhaps try again later. If the reading is accurate so far, then you may continue. Note that sometimes a querant will deny the tr uth. You may know the querant well enough to verify the cards yourself, and yet the querant ma y still deny that your reading is true. Should you continue? The querant at this point refuse s to face the truth. It will us ually be impossible to convince such a querant to open his/her eyes. In most cases therefore, I recommend that you terminate the reading, apologize, and leave. This quera nt probably wants a pl easing carnival reader rather than the truth, and you are wasting your time. If the querant is a close friend, worth the e ffort, you might continue the reading anyway. Perhaps something later in the reading will open the querant's eyes. Perhaps the reading, once complete, will germinate in the querant's subconscious and help at a less conscious level. The decision is up to you. * * * * In Lesson 2 we discussed charlata n/carnival tarot readers, saying, These charlatans often support their claims of mystical knowledge by relaying information to the querant which \"could not be known any othe r way\" (than mystically). Their \"knowledge\" is often general enough to apply to (almost) all querants and questions, or this \"knowledge\" has been extracted from the querant during the reading, either verbally or through body language. Often these carnival readers need only spin a good tale, manipulating their story to appease the audience. Most rubes will belie ve such a story because they want to believe the story. My obvious disdain for these charlatans should not stop you from Satanically taking advantage of these techniques. Querants will unknowingly feed you useful information through their body language. Use this information. Pay conscious attention to the querant's body la nguage, and you will be a better tarot reader. You will be better able to choose between alte rnative interpretations , and you will be more confident in your reading."},{"pageNumber":1000,"pageContent":"Use the information to verify for yourself the va lidity of the reading. Use the information to help convince the querant of the reading's va lidity. Do not reject any information, simply because you collect the information through mundane means, rather than magically. Remember also that most people want to believe. Give the rube s something believable early in your reading, and they will very likely continue to believe your reading when you deal with the unverifiable. Finally, learn to pa y attention to your own reactions to a reading, a nd you'll be better equipped to Xeper. (Read Setian George C. Smith's The Deidentification Process and Personal Power (54) for a discussion of how this can be used to further your own Xeper.) Let us assume that the querant has confirmed the reading, and you are now ready to continue reading. 54 Published in Flames from Hell I.1 (March XXII), and the Ruby Tablet Lesson 14 – Your First Reading, Third Section As discussed above, we have decided to read the lower-left, the internal, psychological/emotional section next. Having read the previous section in depth, havi ng more information now than we did when we first made that decision, we should quickly sc an the remaining cards to see if perhaps we should change the order. In this case we decided to keep to our original plan, to read the psychological section next before examining the future. Concentrate now on that intern al, lower-left group (XXI, A.D, Pm.S). Reread Crowley's description of these cards. Do so now, before continuing on with this lesson. XXI 14 Universe Ace of Disks 10 Prince of Swords 6 The Ace of Disks, the essence of the physical, the \"real\" world, is cen tral to the querant's being. Atu XXI, the Universe, st rengthens the Ace's meaning. Crowley describes a path of xeper which extends from the Fool (0) to the Universe (XXI). A similar path can be traced between the Ace of Di sks and Atu XXI. This latter path is the road which the querant wishes to follow."},{"pageNumber":1001,"pageContent":"Many people (especially those we di scussed in the previous sectio n) would view this path as heavy, stolid, and dull. But as Crowley says, The Disk is a whirling emblem ... every Star, every true Planet, is a whirling sphere. This path can be joyous, symbolizing an Earthl y Indulgence, Indulgence within the suit/theme of Disks/Earth. While this path is not for everyone (it is totally unsuitabl e for the author), this path can be quite suitable for th e querant, as it would be for a magician with close ties to the neter Geb. Note that although the kaballistic path of Atu XXI, between Yesod and Malkuth, is lowest on the Tree, it is one of the three vertical, balanced paths, on th e central pillar. These cards together are healthy, stable, and straightforward. Yet the querant is uncomfortable, uncertain. The cause of this disc omfort seems to come from the Prince of Swords, the Airy aspect of Ai r, the Intellectual Intellect. The intellect is an important part of the que rant's being, but it has a much less steadying influence than the Disks. Indeed, its influen ce is currently quite de stabilizing. As Crowley says, A person thus symbolized is purely intellectual. He is full of ideas and designs which tumble over each other. He is a mass of fine ideas unrelated to practical effort. He has all the apparatus of Thought in the highest degree, in tensely clever, admirably rational, but unstable of purpose, and in reality indifferent even to his ow n ideas, as knowing that any one of them is just as good as any other. The querant's direction of mental activity ch anges frequently, pulling the querant first one way, then another. Projects are started with great gusto, and just as rapidly dropped. Rather than basing a career on this intellectua l activity, I'd recommend that the querant pursue hobbies that satisfy this need for intellectual activity. The querant should concentrate his career on steadier and more \"real\" endeavors. Again, we need to verify this section with the querant. The ne ed for verification is perhaps getting less, since by now the querant should be developing confidence in the reading. But we will soon be dealing with areas that we will not be able to verify. Realize that we are now dealing with the querant himself, and the querant may be psychologically unable to accept your analys is of this secti on of the layout. In this specific reading, the psychological an alysis is simple enough, and positive enough, that the querant is likely to feel comfortable with the analysis and will agree with you. But there will be other analyses that are va lid and true, and yet unpleasant. Most people will not want to admit their own faults. They have often been denying these faults to themselves for years. You will not be able to break through these barriers in one reading. You are not a professional psyc hologist, and the querant is not paying you for psychoanalysis."},{"pageNumber":1002,"pageContent":"If you find the querant is resisting your analysis, skip over this desc ription. Do this area of the reading so you know the message, but don't upset the querant by relaying it to him/her. (55) But what if the querant is you? You, the Setian Magician, should always be able to examine yourself openly, and to change yourself. Such changes may be difficult and painful, but you are the instrument of your own Xeper. As Ipsissimis Aquino once stated in a letter to the author, The bulk of humanity has \"trained\" itself to r un in certain expected/a ccepted \"rat-mazes\" of behavior. ... The Tarot [can be] a device that th e magician may use to reveal an individual's particular rat-maze - in much the same way that psychologists us e ink-blot tests. ... It is the magician's goal to (a ) recognize the maze(s) he is in and (b) get out of it/them and make completely unprogrammed decisions about his brain, body, life, etc. By doing this, of course, the magician also discovers what good ol d A.C. called one's True Self and True Will. The Tarot can be used as a tool to find your own rat-mazes. You, the Setian Magician, are then charged with breaking out of these ruts , of changing your psychological behaviors to truly reflect your True Will. 55 You my need to present a distasteful analysis to the querant later, depending on the analysis of later sections. But at least at this point you can skip anything which is unpleasant to the querant. Lesson 15 – Your First Reading, Fourth Section Because the querant has asked a yes/no questi on, because of the option available to the querant (to change jobs or not to change jobs), and because of what we see in the remaining sections , we will interpret the upper sections as representing two alternate futures. The left hand path (upper left section) will indi cate what lies ahead should the querant make a change, in this case should the querant change jobs. The right hand path (upper right section) will indicate what lies ahead should the querant stay where he is. Which section should be read first? Remember our rule-of-thumb - read from the more known to the less known. While no future can be fully known, the querant should be more familiar with the possibilities in his current job than he is with those of the new job. Let's therefore examine the right section next - wh at does the querant have in his future if he stays in the current job? This potential future is reflected by th e 10.S, 6.D, and Q.S. Again, read Crowley's descriptions of these cards before continuing on with this lesson. Ten of Swords 4 Ruin Six of Disks 8 Success Queen of Swords 12"},{"pageNumber":1003,"pageContent":"The 6.D indicates this querant will achieve a m easure of Success in the current job. Since the 6.D is flanked by Swords on both sides, the success will be more intellectual than worldly. Yes, the querant will find the inte llectual challenge he seeks in his current job, and at least for a short while will successfully meet those challenges. However, Crowley warns that \"t he condition [of Success] is tran sient.\" The cards indicate that intellectual success, however heady and pleasurab le in itself, will not be satisfying to the querant over the long-term. The name of 10.S, Rui n, is as distasteful as 6.D's name of Success is delightful. Crowley describes the Queen of Swords: She will be cruel, sly, deceitful, and unreliable, in this way very dangerous, on account of the superficial beauty and attractiveness which distinguish her. Note the \"newly severed head of a bearded man.\" The current job can be destructive. \"She is the clear, conscious perception of Idea, the Liberator of th e Mind.\" Reflect on the methods and results of some liberators. Sometimes the lib erated are worse off after the liberation than before. The 10.S continues this message. The kaballic Te n is the end of the Tree of Life, the final result of passage down through the sephiroth. This can be a warning, that the current job is a dead-end for the querant. Talking more specifically of the 10.S, Crowley calls it \"reason divor ced from reality,\" and claims that \"It teaches the lesson ... that if one goes on fighting long enough, all ends in destruction.\" Not only do offensive armies fight , but defensive forces fight also. The Queen may symbolize that the querant is irrationally holding onto the current job, fighting against leaving it. Sometimes change is required, not just for gr owth, but even to maintain health. Fighting against this change can be destructive. Intellectual activity can be an end (Ten) unto itself. For some people this could be quite desirable. But this querant (as discussed ear lier) needs more physical satisfaction, and purely intellectual rewards woul d not be acceptable. (A more positive reading involving intellectua l success could involve 6.D [Success] along with 2.S [Peace], 4.S [Truce], 6.S [S cience], Pm.S, and/or Pf.S.) Remember back to our earlier sections within this reading, to our discussions with the querant. It's supposed to be the new opportunity which provides a chance for intellectual stimulation, while the current j ob is comfortable and dull, almo st boring. Are the cards being inconsistent? 10.S here has both kaballistic a nd numerological interpretations. (56) While the kaballistic Ten is the End, the numerological Ten is the start of a new, more comp lex cycle. It states that if the querant stays in his current job, the job itself will change."},{"pageNumber":1004,"pageContent":"Perhaps the querant's managers feel they mu st challenge the querant (such an obviously intelligent man, who must be interested in adva ncement). If they don't challenge him, they will lose this valuable employee, the querant, to a more promising job. Or maybe other forces are at work to cause a change in the job (t his might be another interpretation of the 10.W in the lower right section). The conclusion of this upper right section is that the currently comfortable job will become less comfortable, more challenging, and ev entually destructive for the querant. 56 Crowley's interpretations of the cards very often seem to be heavily slanted towards the Kaballah rather than towards Numerology. While this is understandable and acceptable from a kabbalistic scholar, and one who went to great lengths to keep his Book of Thoth consistent with the Kabbalah, we must remembet hsi tendency of Crowley's when we research the meani ngs of cards in the Book of Thoth , and we must not let ourselves be swayed from the more accurate interpretations. Lesson 16 – Your First Reading, Final Section Having examined the querant's future in his current job, let us look at his future if he takes the new job. This future is symbolized by th e Q.W, 8.S, and 8.D. Again, read Crowley's description of these cards before continuing with this lesson. Queen of Wands 13 Eight of Swords 9 Interference Eight of Disks 5 Prudence The Eight of Swords describes the major imp act of taking the new job. The Swords reflects the active involvement of the intellect, while the Eight reflects wo rldly involvement and material success or failure. The new job will an swer the querant's desire for some intellectual involvement, and may also answer the que rant's need for material comfort. These are numerological interpretations, and in Numerology the Eight is a chancy number - it may be lucky or unlucky for the querant. According to the kaballah, the Eight is unbalanc ed, low on the pillar of Severity. Crowley attempts to lighten the impact of this position in The Four Eights , where he says: Yet one may perhaps urge this alleviation, that the Eights come as (in a sense) a remedy for the error of the Sevens. The mischief has been done; and there is now a reaction against it. One may, therefore, expect to find that, while th ere is no possibility of perfection in the cards of this number, they are free from such essent ial and original errors as in the Lower case. The Eight of Swords itself is described as re flecting a \"lack of pers istence in matters of intellect.\" And while \"'Good fortune' attends even these weakened efforts ... Yet the Will is constantly thwarted by accidental interference.\""},{"pageNumber":1005,"pageContent":"We've already discussed the querant's enjoymen t of intellectual activities, and his much greater involvement in worldly affairs. The quera nt does suffer from a lack of persistence in matters of intellect. Reversing Crowley's fi nal statement, even though the job might be continually interfered with by small annoyan ces and problems, and even though the querant does not doggedly pursue and complete complex intellectual tasks, still minor amounts of good fortune will result from this new job. The Queen of Wands reflects adap tability and persiste nt energy. She is th e Watery part of Fire, its fluidity and color. She is flexibility and motion. The querant will need this flexib ility to deal with the repeate d, picayune interference presaged by the 8.S. While at times he may run low on energy, the Q.W indicates he can survive and even grow in this environment. The Eight of Disks shares many of the attributes of the 8.S, but resides in the suit of Disks. This number reflects worldly involvement in the worldly suit. Prudence \"is the card of 'putting something aw ay for a rainy day,'\" according to Crowley. He goes on to say, \"There is a sort of strength in doing nothing at all.\" Time is on the querant's side, if the querant will take advantage of it. This new job will be no bed of roses, bedeviled by annoyance after annoyance. The querant will not find Success nor Happiness there. But th e job will most likely be better in the long run for the querant than hi s current job would be. Remember our original opinions, given to a nd verified by the querant, and supported by the first few sections within this reading, that th e current job was materially oriented, while the new job would be intellectually challenging. Instead, we find th e current job intellectually oriented (two Swords), and the new j ob materially orient ed (two Eights). Our recommendation is therefore that the quera nt take the new job. His current job is apparently going to be changing characteristics which make it less suitable for him. This new job will apparently be much more to his liking, much more like his current job, than previously suspected. Lesson 17 – Your First Reading, An Extension The querant, your friend, has a problem. The cards show him well suited to a passive, material-oriented career, with in tellectual hobbies. Yet both paths into the future point to an intellectually active future, where worl dly consideration appears secondary. Although the way I read the cards put the new job in a better li ght than the old, the querant's choice (to him) is by no means clear . Which path is truly better? Many readings at this point ar e complete, with satisfied quera nt. They are over, done with, and you should go on to different things. But on occasion, the answer of the reading may not be totally satisfactory to you or to the querant. Let us assume that this is the case."},{"pageNumber":1006,"pageContent":"Your friend may have wanted the reading for a ny of several reasons: he may have wanted to change jobs, but worried about losing what he already had. He may not have had any way to determine whether changing jobs or staying in his current job would be better, and seriously wanted advice. Or he may want to stay in th e current job, and be looki ng to support his desire to turn down this new job. In either of the first two cases, he is probably satisfied with th e answer you've given him, and the reading is over. We've given him a good excuse to change jobs, or some more information to work with. But in the last of these cases, all you've done is frustrate the querant. Your answer conflicts with his desires, without being c onclusive enough to sway him. Let's assume the latter case (if only to continue the lesson). The cards say that the querant will be a little better off if he changes jobs, and the querant isn't sure if this little better off is worth the stress involved in the change. He suspects (he wants to belie ve) that it isn't, that he'll be better off staying where he is. In such a case, it's possible to extend the read ing, to modify the layout by adding more cards on the fly. The querant's uncertainty is about the future. Which path is better? Perhaps we can examine further into the future and get more information. We can extend a layout by adding cards whic h will have meaning according to their position. (57) How can we add cards to this layout to look further into the future? The original layout looks into th e future through the relationship of the upper sections to the middle section. As shown in , cards 4-8-12 show the future which follows from not changing jobs, while cards 13-9-5 show the future which follows from changing jobs. These are the two paths leading from the querant's current st ate of being, represen ted by cards 2-1-3.

Ca rds g-h-i describe a future in which the current opportunity is take n, and the querant stays in that job for a long time (or makes no more job changes at all), a nd cards j-k-l des-cribe a future where the querant takes advantage of this current opportunity, and then ta kes advantage of yet another opportunity further in the future. If we were to lay out these twelve additional cards, we would have a 27 card layout (of 78 cards in the tarot deck). This is quite feasible , and sometimes advisable. We would do this if we wished to attempt an in-depth study of these alternate futures. Laying out yet another level, anot her 24 cards further into the futu re, would result in 51 of 78 cards being used. This is stil l feasible, though less likely to be attempted. Think of all the work that would be involved in interpreting al l those cards! And the querant would very likely be more confused than before. How many peopl e can intelligently choose between so many options? Instead of all this, and instead of even 12 addition al cards, let us lay out but four more cards, one for each alternate future. This time, each car d will be individually cut from the deck. We will lay them out right to left. shows the complete layout, using only card number s (the order in which the cards were dealt) for the original 15 cards, and using the fully expanded notation for the four new cards. shows this layout in yet another fashion. (Find these new cards in your deck and add them to your layout.) The right-most card describes the querant's future if the querant were to doggedly remain in his current job, letting opportuni ty after opportunity pass him by. The name of the Seven of Disks, Failure, is an obvious report that this policy will result in unhappiness. Crowley states, The Seven of Disks is called Failure. This su it gives the extreme of passivity; there is no positive virtue in it below the Abyss. This card is ruled by Saturn.

That is all. L abour itself is abandone d; everything is sunk in sloth. The connection between this card and its posit ion in the layout, the option it represents, should be obvious to the querant. We need not be insulting by digging deeper into the psychological tendencies it reveals. If the querant passes up this current opportunit y, but takes some other, then his future is reflected by Atu X, Fortune. Be sure to stress that this is not good fortune, but simply the obvious intervention of luck. Whether the luck is good or bad will largely be a question of chance. Some future opportunities will be good; so me will be bad. The cards indicate that the querant's future will depend on which opportunities the querant deci des to take, and that the querant may not be able to determine in a dvance whether these opportu nities are good or bad for him. (Note that path 4-7 touc hes Netzach, which gave Failure.) Possibility # 3: The querant takes the new job a nd then stays with that job for many years. The card which reflects this future is the Nine of Swords, Cruelty. The 9.S reflects the completion of the 8.S, th e satisfaction of the querant's desire for intellectual activity. It shows more than satisf action - the querant is now so intellectually involved that the job has become cruel, demandi ng, and not at all pleasan t. \"The card is ruled by Mars in Gemini; it is agony of mind.\" The querant will be able to take the picayune problems of 8.S for only so long...

In this future , the querant accepts the new job, stays but for a short while, and then moves on to some other opportunity. Luxury, 4.C, is by far the best result we see. While neither the numbe r nor suit is highly material, the name certainly is. The Numerological Four is the end of a cycle, a time of and opportunity for rest. The Kaballist ic Four is a sephirah of power and energy, Chesed, the creator of form . Finally, this is the one and only card within the suit of Cups to appear in the layout. While we said earlier that Watery considerations are s ubsidiary to the Earthly and Airy consideration, all humans need Balance in their lives. This card brings that balance. This first new job is not the querant's utopia, bu t while in this job the querant will find another opportunity that will lead to utopia. Yes the querant should take the new job. And th e querant should keep his eyes open for yet another opportunity, one that will be available only from this ne w job (not from the old). And when the querant finds that utopia, he should grab it. 57 There are other methods of extending layouts, but we'll save them for later lessons. Lesson 18 – A Summary of the First Reading Let us recap and examine what we've done, and why we've done it this way. On hearing the question, we (58) decided to use the Wasserman Layout. We shuffled the cards, had the querant cut the cards once, and then de alt 15 cards off the top of the deck, as shown by the layout. We read the central section, a nd then the lower right, external section. Having verified the validity of these sections, we then proceeded to the lower left, internal section, and then the upper right, near future, and th en the upper left, far future. Our answer was that the querant should change jobs. But the answ er was not strong enough to convince the querant; the new job/new future was not attractive enough. We then extended the reading into the future, one card for each future option. These cards clearly indicated that the new job, followed by a second change, is the best course of action for the querant to take. And there we stop the reading. We may continue answering questions about the reading, to help the querant feel better and more confid ent about the reading. Bu t we will not lay down any more cards. Once an answer is clear, stop. You are asking the cards to simulate or appr oximate the real universe. The more cards you add to a layout, the more closely they will approximate the real universe."},{"pageNumber":1010,"pageContent":"And the reason for the querant's question is th at the real universe is too complex for the querant. The purpose of the reading is to simplify the real universe, so the querant can deal with it. Keep the reading simple; do not a dd unnecessary complexity to the reading. Now is also a good time for the student to star t over. Reread your introduction to Alchemy, Numerology, and the Kaballah. Reread this prim er, from chapter 1 th rough this current chapter. A talented and skilled Tarot reader meets three im portant requirements: 1) the reader is able to raise his Higher Self, and involve that Higher Self in the reading. 2) the reader is familiar with the cards, their symbolism, and their interpreta tions. 3) the reader is experienced. As with almost any skill, the reader learns by doing. 1) This primer can not help you raise nor invol ve your Higher Self. The magician must accept full responsibility for this activity, not only wh en reading, but in all Magical activity, and eventually in all aspects of Life. 2) This primer will help you become familiar with the cards, their symbolism, and their interpretations. But it can not do the job alone . Even with years of experience and perhaps hundreds of readings behind him, the author sti ll reads Crowley's Book of Thoth from time to time, and still studies the cards for their own sake. The serious student will do the same. Now is a good time to reread the Book of Thot h yourself, and to review the symbolism and interpretations of the cards. 3) This primer also can not help you devel op experience. Only you can do that, by actually doing readings. You should now start doing simp le readings yourself. Exercise your now developing knowledge and skill. Perform a few r eadings for yourself now, before continuing on with the primer. It will give you be tter insight to the lessons to come. 58 we, the reader Author's note: This is the first stage of publication of this Tarot Primer . Additional lessons will be developed, and will be added to this primer as each set is comple ted. Do not wait for them ... if you can raise your Higher Self and intelligently examine the symbolism within the Ta rot, you will learn much more by Doing than the later chapters would be able to teach.

Collectors of o ccult textbooks are presen ted with a multitude of titles to whet their appetites, each presenting some new facet of Enochiana to the eager public. There can be no doubt that this system has a uni que appeal. Resurrected from dusty antiquity by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn at the turn of the Century, it was embellished and expanded. Aleister Crowley then undertook his ce lebrated skrying into the Thirty Aethyrs. Later, Magus LaVey included the Enoc hian Keys in The Satanic Bible and demonstrated the malleability of their applications. The Temple of Set has in no wise neglected the Keys. With us, they reach a new standard of purity (as their curious corruptions are dropped, and the original form of each Key restored) and beau ty (a fresh and profound presentation of the meaning of the Keys to reflect our more adva nced magical insight), and have become known as the Word of Set. Prior to affiliating with the Temple of Set, I commenced my own series of Workings with the Aethyrs. These have continued, a nd evolved as I have, and are now presented in this paper as a fascinating record of Initi ation and personal Xeper. 1. This paper consists of several parts: 1.

It may perhaps be considered as a catalyst to Remanifestation as a result of my work to da te, a conscious assimilation of my progress in this field. It is to be hoped that other Setians may find it in spir-ing/intriguing/challenging and that resultant feedback and discus sion may benefit all concerned. A Rational Overview of the Enochian System The Enochian system did not really excite a ny interest amongst occultists until the Hermetic Order of the Golden dawn decided to pay it some attention, and it wa s adapted to suit the Qabalistic outlook of that order through the geni us of S.L. MacGregor Mathers. Indeed, the Golden Dawn viewed the Enochian system as \"the jewel in its crown.\" Since much of contemporary occultism is ultimately derived from the Golden Dawn, the Enochian system has maintained its popularity. However, it has suffered a series of i ndignities and corruptions in the process. When studying Enochiana, it is well to go right back to its beginnings, with Dee and Kelly. Dr. John Dee's Actions With Spirits is a tortuous read by anyone's standards, but it is essential reading nevertheless if one wishes to unders tand Enochian and put it in perspective. From the outset, we can disregar d all such details as pyramid s quares of the Watchtowers, and attribution of the Egyptian deit ies thereto. These were additions to the basic system made by the Golden Dawn. It must be confessed that th ey are often very beautif ul additions, but they must be discarded nonetheless if we wish to discover the roots of the system. It is rapidly obvious that neith er Dee nor Kelly had any real idea of what they were being presented with. More often than not they were entangled in their own material concerns and totally confused by the material they were d ealing with. The classic example is where the spirit Madimi has spent considerable time expounding deep philosophical matters, only to have Kelly butt in and ask \"Can you, Madimi, lend me two hundred pounds for a fortnight?\" Dee's records, though precise a nd painstaking to the point of tediousness, are muddled and confused, as he was never really certain in his own mind as to the correct application and context of this work. But what can be gleaned from his notes is that the matter is in its essence very simple and straightforward, a nd can be summarized as follows: 1. There are four great Watchtowers, in the f our Elemental quarters. These contain the names of various spirits of greater and lesser pot ency that can be deduced by following certain simple rules. 2. There are Thirty Aires, or Aethyrs, that su rround and interpenetrate the earth. These have each their respective Governors, whose names ar e likewise contained in the letters that constitute each Watchtower. 3. Forty eight Calls, or Keys, in a language attr ibuted to these spirits , and named after Enoch, who we are told first understood this wisdom, ar e provided to call forth these spirits in their proper order and to accomplish magical effects by their aid, also to converse with them. That is the original Enochian sy stem of magic in a nut shell. Later additions can be accepted or denied as the individual magician deems fit, as long as it is understood that they are additions."},{"pageNumber":1019,"pageContent":"The first task facing the Enochian student is to unravel the basic magical hypothesis from Dee's painfully pious Judaeo-Chr istian colouring. Dee paints ev erything with a white-wash of piety, but if one simply ignores the references to God, the Devil, sin, etc., and interprets them as the outlook of a man of his times, we can approach the system afresh. If the later attributions of Orders such as the Golden Dawn to each little square in nitpicking detail is adhered to, the magician faces the additional pa in of having to unthread their philosophical bias, which is often just as pious as Dee's in its way. When Aleister Crowley commenced his work of skrying the Aethyrs, he could have done the Enochian system no greater benefit, for his b eautiful prose and visiona ry genius swept away the Christianized assumptions of Dee in one fell swoop, and presented Enochiana as something vital and refreshing, now integrated wi th the current of his Aeon of HarWer. Using Crowley's excellent work as a star ting point, our task of finally rehabilitating the essentials of the system is made much easier. Magus LaVey took the process one st ep further in his Satanic Bible , when he presented a Crowleyan version of the Keys, along with a powerfully compelli ng and stirring Satanic rendition of the English of the Calls. Perhaps this more than anything else finally blasted away the cobwebs of superstition and presente d Enochian magic as something that was the tool of the magician, to do with as he w illed, not merely a pious collection of outdated philosophical moralizations. The Satanic Keys were alive and vital, they were stirring and lent themselves easily to practical magical applica tion. LaVey termed Enochian the \"language of magicians.\" This paved the way for the Temple of Set to present Enochian magic in full honesty. In The Word of Set we find the definitive, corrected version of the Enochian Keys in all their glory, as they were originally set down by Dee. We al so find an honest attempt to take the meanings of those Keys in English and tr ansliterate them out of their El izabethan piety, and into a form that whilst retaining the same magical import, has some meaning and application for working magicians today. As Set declares in The Book of Coming Forth by Night , “Proclaim the nineteen Parts of the Word, and vanquish thus the feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch, which were but a shadow of my true Word and are now an affront to me... Think carefully of the Word of Set, for it is given in witness to my Bond.“ Ultimately, Enochian cannot be accepted as some supernatural language. John Dee is famous for his work with codes and ciphers, and doubtle ss this peculiarity of his own mind is the reason why his magical path t ook him along such a course, expounding wisdom to him in the form of a magical language. This does not mean that this system is of no use to us as a tool; it has many years of dedicated use behind it that proves its value when utilized in the proper spirit. Also, even if the Enochian words are ultimately the creation of man, that does not necessarily lessen their efficac y. Nor does it lessen the profound meaning of those words, as expounded in the Word of Set . Indeed, we have Set's own instru ction to look to his Word. It is interesting that Israel Regardie , a champion of Enochian as a \"r eal\" language, always declared in the same sentence as his judgement on this matter that he was unqualified to hold such an opinion. In his Black Pyramid dated August 1993, Ipsissimus Aquino had a good deal of wisdom to shed upon this matter, and I feel justified in quoting the High Priest's words here:"},{"pageNumber":1020,"pageContent":"Take Enochiana as an example. This was a system developed by John Dee based firmly on J/C imagery: angels, demons, and a Hebrew Cabalistic schematic of \"creation.\" If you believe in it as John Dee wrote it down, you're a good little amateur Hebrew. First Mathers, then Crowley, then LaVey saw it for what it was: a collection of confusing gobbledegook which they could reword here and there and use as an LBM de vice to impress their followers. And so it did. People would read the Satanic Bible and say of the first half, \"Yeah, he's got a point, but all this social critique stuff doesn't look very 'occult' to me.\" Then they'd reach the Enochian Keys, be properly mystified by both the Enochian and the English versions, and say, \"Wow, this is spooky & weird stuff. Apparently he does know something 'occult' that the rest of us don't.\" And of course the \"Dumbo's feather\" principle [cf. Black Magic in the Crystal Tablety ] applied beautifully. We dutifully used the Enochian Keys in C/S rituals and they did exactly what we expected them to do [i.e. what Anton said they would do!] without realizing that they held no intrinsic power at all, but instead served as \"keys (apt name!) to unlock\" certain dormant/latent powers within our own beings. The Word of Set Working with the Keys was thus a \"pure\" Working with them, in which the original Dee \"Enochian\" and \"translations\" were used as a \"magical tr igger\" to get at a coherent reality underlying Dee's J/C- filtered thoughts. And there we have it! In all workings with magi cal \"systems\" it is essential to remember that we are dealing with something that has been filtered through somebody else's thoughts. We can use its history and magical associations as a \"Dumbo's fe ather,\" thus engaging it as a \"magical trigger\" in order to stimulate our ow n abilities. No system has any intrinsic power, other than that which it is grante d by the Self of the magician. Why use Enochian rather than some other system? The only answer can be personal preference and genuine interest, coupled with a desi re to look deeper into the meanings of the Word of Set . The meaning that we personally give to Enochian renders it valid for us. This matter of individual meaning carrying so mu ch weight in magic was the source of some discomfort in occult circles when The Satanic Bible was published, as recounted in Ipsissimus Aquino's The Church of Satan . To quote from one of the footnotes: In a letter to me dated September 30, 1978, Dr. Regardie remarked: \"My reference to the Satanic Bible as a debased volume was predicated on my opinion that LaVe y here was dishonest. Ther e are specific words in the Enochian language for 'God', etc. To tran slate them as 'Satan', 'the Devil', et c. I say now as then is dishonest. It is a pity that Dr. Regardie did not also a ddress the corruptions and distortions that occurred under the hands of the Golden dawn, to force a square peg into a round hole, when they tried to fit Enochiana into their ow n brand of Qabalistic thought. In the final analysis, none of these corruptions and distortions seem to have affected the Enochian magician's ability to work magic, and t hus we come back yet again to the Temple of Set's assumption that magic is something that springs from the Self, and is not dependent upon external names, signs, figures, or indeed languages. Thus in the Word of Set the Temple has restored the Keys to their original form , and has faithfully re-i nterpreted the underlying meanings and philosophy to accord with magic as understood by the Temple of Set, in a form appropriate to the Aeon of Set. Having established the foundations of Enochian ma gic, I feel this work may be placed in correct context by quoting Ipsissimus James Le wis from his commentary and analysis upon The Book of Coming Forth by Night in the Book of Leviathan :"},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"Setians who are interested in performing the series of Aethyr Workings will find themselves well-rewarded for the troubles involved. Those who do will find keeping a diary of the Workings a good idea. This is that diary. A Consideration of the Working Environment The important details concerning my evol ving working methods are outlined in the introductory comments of each Into The Aethyrs section of this paper. These were deliberately written up in groups of ten Aethyrs as each se ction was completed, in order to present a maturing and progressive perspectiv e, rather than merely the view in retrospect as afforded by the paper as a whole. In these essays and their developing philosophy, we are witness to a record of Xeper in progress. In these essays will be found details of which version of the Nineteenth Key was used on which occasions, as well as comments to tie this work in with my initiatory progress in general. The purpose of this current section of the paper is to simply add one or two comments to tie the others together. It should be obvious to even the most casual read er that a tremendous series of advances are borne witness to in the developing testimony of the records of my Workings. From very tentative beginnings in the lower ten Aethyrs, the Workings develop in to a more rationally applied analysis of the relationship between Self and not-Self in the middle ten Aethyrs, followed by the sublimity of the naked essence of Self alone in the final series of ten. The accompanying essays chart these changes as th ey were noted at the time, and they are apparent to any discerning readers in the series of diary records. It is apparent at certain distinct stages that I have been influenced by reading Ipsissimus Crowley's The Vision and the Voice , but equally often the vision is entirely my own, although I can usually perceive similarities in the unde rlying symbolism or deduced meaning. As well as reading the aforementioned work, I have also been honoured to read some of the impressions of the Aethyrs recorded by Adept Ea rdley W. Scott, to whom I am indebted, and also the Apep Workings of Ipsissimus Lewis, which can be found in the Book of Leviathan . It should also be obvious that some of the Wo rkings were more fruitful than others, and certain of the diary records mean much more to me than others. I unashamedly present them all here nonetheless. I make no claims to perfec tion, and this paper is intended as an account of a developing Work, not only the meaty bits. Th e poorer Workings (which I feel were due to my own tiredness, preoccupation, etc) shoul d be obvious. The visi ons of NIA and OXO spring immediately to mind, as both are too \"eas y\" (see the comment from Adept Scott's letter below) and too obviously painted with my own idiosyncrasies. The final series of ten are beautiful beyond doubt, and my memory of the or iginal MAZ Working affects me deeply. Adept Scott pointed out the dangers of work ing with the Aethyrs when he wrote, It would have been an easy thing to simply accept the so-called vision of the Aethyr, and to assign some wonderfully spiritual interpretation to make me feel high as a kite.. . There seems to be a recurring test with each Aethyr, in that there are two possible concepts within eac h realm. One being, the reality of the Aethyr and the other being the illusion, it being up to the individual to discern. One can accept the real and learn or one may accept the fantasy and feel also g ood about not conf ronting life."},{"pageNumber":1022,"pageContent":"My experience agrees wholeheart edly with this, and the cont rast between my stronger and weaker written records testify to it also. We should learn ev en from our prior failings. Whilst on this note, I think it wo rthwhile to quote Ipsissimus Le wis, who sent me one of his usual insightful letters, fairly cl ose to the time of writing up this paper, after he had read parts one and two of Into The Aethyrs: Keeping a diary is a helpful thing to do, particularly when dealing with Magic. I look back on some of my own Magical Diaries and feel quite impressed with them - and then find others which strike me as having been a waste of the time it took to record them. No one can work at top capacity all the time, you know. However, I encourage you to continue using the diary as a productive tool. It is in the spirit of that a dvice that this paper is offered, not as a lesson but as an illustration, and as an objective reflection of that subjec tive Remanifestation which I have experienced through Working with the Aethyrs. This paper does not represent a Work completed, but a Work begun. These are my initial comments upon my initial Workings. After a break in which I have many other matters to attend to pert aining to my Xeper, I will return to Working with the Word of Set . Thoughts on possible further Work are included later in this paper. Of course, there are no objectivel y existing Thirty Aethyrs. This system merely represents a framework in which to effectivel y explore the mysteries of Self, isolating aspects of that Self according to Will and observing the actions and in teractions of Self. As a convenient tool, the Aethyrs are superb and of great va lue, but it is important to keep this in true perspective. This leads me to quote the irrepressi ble Ipsissimus Lewis once again, fr om issue 98 of the Trail of the Serpent : I cannot shake the impression that if we allow the symbol to rule and subsequently ignore reality, we open the door to mental illness. As explained in the essays contained in the Into The Aethyrs sections of this paper, the actual version of the Ninet eenth Part of the Word of Set used by me changed at specific points during the series of Workings. The following ritual out line details the final version of the Working I used, and is written with respect to TEX, the Th irtieth Aethyr (and first to be experienced).

INTO THE AETHYRS - Part One Preliminaries: This writing refers to a series of experiment s I have been conducting in skrying the Thirty Aethyrs of the Enochian system of Magic. It ha d originally been my intention to record the results in my diary and subsequently write them all up in an annotated form at a later date, when all thirty experiments had been conclude d. On reflection, however, I believe it will be ultimately more revealing to present the findings in three installments, especially since a natural break is reached in ASP (see 'Sacred Cows' below), and another landmark will be forthcoming in ZAX, the Abyss, at the Tenth Aethyr, thus neatly di viding the account into three parts. Dividing the record in this manne r will make it an interesting study to trace the development not only of the Aethyric visions, but also of the scribe's reaction to and account of them, contemporaneously ra ther than in retrospect. It should go on record that to date I have used the version of the Nineteenth Call as given in Magus LaVey's Satanic Bible , as I find this preferable in its glamour to the Golden Dawn version, but do not yet have access to the superior Word of Set in the Ruby Tablet . In purely practical terms in the context of a pragmatic GBM Working, this makes little difference, as related in 'Sacred Cows'."},{"pageNumber":1024,"pageContent":"Sacred Cows: Enochiana has acquired a great deal of glamour to itself and rightly so, bu t glamour is all it is. This is not to scorn it, for glamour in the Ritu al Chamber can contribute a great deal. But it is necessary for the record to state that I do not believe in the actual existence of Thirty Aethyrs. They are, however, a convenient map for ex amining the Self and the Universe and for pursuing the quest for Xeper. Moreover, th e ever-expanding boundaries of the progressive Aethyrs provide a wonderful insight into the Word Runa, uttered by Magus Flowers. It is important to recognize the fact that the Aethyr s are purely a tool, a symbolic device, before commencing work with them. Having recognized that, they serve an admirable function in bringing various aspects of the psyche into aw areness, each in its proper turn. There is no shame in using pitons in a properly structured attempt to climb a cliff - the climber never mistakes his self-created stepping stones for the cliff itself. Nor do I believe Enochian to be a divinely in spired language. Dee's fascination with codes, cyphers and languages tends to suggest that he created it for a Magical purpose, for its sounds and rhythms. If it were genuinely unearthly, th en the Hebraized abortion used by the Golden Dawn would have no effect at all, and this is ma nifestly not the case. Fo r this reason, I view it as no great disadvantage to ha ve employed the Satanic Bible Call, though for purely philosophical and aesthetic reasons, the Word of Set would prove better. It should be remembered that the accounts of the visions given below, extracted from my diary, were written in the buzzing afterglow of a GBM experience. No claim is made to exalted power and status, merely to insights be aring upon the same. The ve ry nature of such experiences places the skrier in a central role as the Aethyr is unfolded to his senses, and the most important aspect of the Working is to ra tionally integrate its revelations into everyday life. Failure to do this and the temptation to get carried away in absurd, unwarranted assumptions is the major danger in working with the Aethyrs. Contrary to some assertions, I believe that anybody can achieve some success, some degree of insight, with every Aethyr, even up to LIL - what will differ is the intensity and practical applicability of that insight. If this is remembered, it is not too difficult to leave megalomania behind and concentrate instead on the proper processes of one's own initiation. What is more important than the written accounts of the visions is the summary given be low, which is drawn from them after the event, viewed rationally in the cold light of da y. Nor do I believe that the Aethyrs should be a singular experience, I intend to skry them cycli cally, repeating the process every few years. In this way, a true insight into one's own initiato ry progress can be gained by comparison with earlier forays. I acknowledge my debt to Aleister Crowley's The Vision and the Voice . Having read his masterpiece, it is impossible to deny its influe nce. It is inevitable that any subconscious remembrance of it will have 'coloured' my own perceptions, but in recognizing this perhaps I have avoided its more restrictive effects. What was less welcome were the contrived and dogmatic opinions expounded by the Schuelers in their Enochian writings, which strait- jacketed my perceptions of TEX and RII to no small degree. Realizing this at an early stage, I ceased working with reference to their writings and allowed several months to elapse before continuing the sequence, whereupon the visions proved to be far more fluid and satisfying, much more representative of mySelf, without outside influence or taint. As with Crowley, therefore, there was a gap of quite some time between the lowest two Aethyrs and those that follow, and also as w ith Crowley, these visions are of a manifestly"},{"pageNumber":1025,"pageContent":"inferior nature (almost cringeworthy to me now ) in comparison to what was to follow. The lessons drawn from them in the summary rema in wholly valid, however, and this is the important point. It should be remembered th at an examination of the Aethyrs is an examination of one's own mind and whatever visi ons occur are merely visual representations and symbols (since we are largely used to visu al forms of perception) of innermost thoughts. The visions will be unique for every individu al, therefore. No ultimate objective validity should be granted to anything seen or heard - a rational and sane anal ysis is essential. There seems to be a definite change in fl avour between the 29th and 28th Aethyrs (even allowing for the lapse in time), and the 21st Aeth yr also seems to mark a point of shifting emphasis, with a greater reference to the Self and less to what lies outside of Self. The distinction between Self and not-Self is ve ry apparent throughout, and I cannot help wondering what Right Hand Path practitioners make of this. The dualistic current of the Aethyrs is very strong indeed, almost aggressively so. It remains to place matters in context by explaini ng that during the course of skrying TEX and RII I was still a member of the Church of Sata n. The changeover period when I affiliated with the Temple of Set is marked by BAG and Z AA. From this point onwards, Setian imagery becomes ever stronger in my perceptions and th e more recent visions have been impressively more insightful and illuminating as a result.

The Thirtieth Aethyr - TEX Sunday 21st November, XXVII AES, 12:59 a.m. At first, I stood upon a central, circular tabl e of silver which revolved slowly, drawn round by four very world-wear y Kerubic Beasts. Large mountains loomed in the North and I walked over to them, finding a colossal figure crudely shaped from stone, bound by the shackles of Karma. This is the illusion of constraint caused by self-guilt and hypocris y. But illusions can be shattered and freedom triumph. The stone man fell to pieces as a beautiful, blazing wh ite, nude figure broke out. This was the True Fool, Der Reine Thor, all-powerful in his innocence. I rode a camel to a sumptuous palace in the East, a place of decadent luxury, where semi- naked youths of great beauty waited upon me as I reclined. But desire must not stagnate, it must progress if it is to spur life to the greatest achievements. This is the motivating power and also the lesson of th e value of imperfection. Riding the camel to a hazy, empty desert in the South, all remained barren and inert. A small, thin man with a severe expression, clad in a black toga, materialized before me, cast me a glance, then turned on his heel a nd vanished again without a word. Moving on to the West, I was faced by a tall, angry man in black, w ho scorned me, mocking my efforts, chastising me for wanting to put my work always off until the next day. But I retorted that I always achieve. I acknowledge an d delight in my vices, for they are a part of me and often my greatest pleasures. The Twenty-Ninth Aethyr - RII Friday 27th November XXVII AES, 9:31 p.m. I arrived in a bright, luxurious region of palatial grandeur, where kindly, dignified old men debated philosophy and took their ease in the gard en, the Heaven of re ligion. Wandering into my own private Paradise, I saw beautiful, nake d youths reclining, one of them running to me, embracing and kissing me. The realm of daydream and fantasy, wish fulfillment. Accepting this region, I passed on. I strode across bare, bleak, barren rocks, wi ndswept and utterly devoid of growth. Grey, weary old men sat still and desolate on chairs of cold stone, their egos long since snuffed out, empty zombies without sense or circumstance. I then travelled to a shore, where a whirlpool cast lost souls upon the shingle. Dazed and confused, they gave their names and an account of themselves to a seated magisterial figure, then re-entered the water when directed to do so, swallowed once again by the whirlpool. The magistrate had two merciless eyes, but his other features were blank, his face smooth like an egg."},{"pageNumber":1027,"pageContent":"I then entered the darkness of Hell, the shadows pierced by roaring flames.

The Twenty-Eighth Aethyr - BAG Sunday 6th June XXVIII AES, 1:36 a.m. I stood upon a barren plain of crumbling, black ro ck, scarred and pitted. Stars shone brightly overhead, but somehow seemed very distant and remote. I saw the hideous, blackened, corrupt figure of th e crucified Christ, naile d to a cross. He was cackling insanely, his malice wrapped around the earth, mantling it in guilt and blindness. Whenever man looks beyond his immediate confines , he sees this figure, shackling him down with misery and shame. I proclaimed to him that my sins are my own and my very delight and no other has any claim to them. I then saw the multitudes lying prostrate before his foul, venomous form, some blinkered, shuffling and stumbling as they abased themselv es in his shadow, others tightly forcing their own eyelids closed, terrified le st they might perceive the vastness beyond. Tormented by their guilts, they are at least reminded that they exist. Yet great holes were blasted in the ground from beneath, light streaming out of them to the stars. Here were those few who could laugh at piety and the Rules of the Game, reaching beyond. He cursed and struggled, but the stars la ughed at him and mocked his affliction. I then expanded to enormous size, and towered over him, threatening to kick his totem into splinters, grinding him into the ground. He sh rieked and pleaded fo r mercy, writhing in impotent terror. But I laughed, proclaiming myse lf the puppet master on whose strings he danced. He serves the purpose of keeping th e masses under the control of the great Satanic Masters who have ever ruled the world, but possesses no power over the true elite. The Twenty-Seventh Aethyr - ZAA Sunday 25th July, XXVIII AES I found myself standing at a spooky, si nister crossroads at night, in the shadow of a leafless, twisted gallows tree, creaking in the wind. A black-clad, pale Vampire then appeared in th is haunted spot, fixing me with his burning gaze. He professed himself the spirit of power and immortality, but also of intense isolation and loneliness. He offered me his Kiss, the Kiss of immortality, but warned that it would sever me for ever from the fellowship of men. I accepted his Kiss eagerly and as he bit into my neck, I likewise bit him, drinking deeply of his ice-cold blood. At this moment, my thirst for personal survival manifested in its true fullness. Now immortal, I, like he, have no longer anything in common with lesser mortals. I abide here at the crossroads of dimensions, on th e borderland between Worlds, in a state of Undeath.

We took wing and flew over a night shrouded forest to a barren wilderness of ice. Here stood a Dark Tower, wherein I sat as a Dark Lord on my Dark Throne. I abide in no place, but exist in every place. The Twenty-Sixth Aethyr - DES Monday 2nd August XXVIII AES, 1:28 a.m. I was in a black void, with rolling clouds above and below me, flashe s of lightning crashing up and down between them, to the rhythm of three-fold beats of thunder. A vast, dark Spirit approached, pale faced and robed in black. Its enormous wings were like huge scythes, cleaving the air in ci rcular slashes in its wake. I pe rceived that it had two heads, one above and one below, like a play ing card, and it wailed piteously. I called upon the Names of the G overnors and the Spirit regained its composure, telling me that I had passed beyond the circles of the Ea rth, coming to that blasphemous and tortuous realm whence the fragmented dualities that su stain the life of the world are wrought. He waved a hand and the clouds below me parted , revealing a world in which peace-makers and war-mongers rubbed shoulders, where armies marched and people partied. Each of these people was as a puppet on strings. He waved his other hand and the clouds above me parted, revealing a Dark Throne, on which sat the Puppet Master, the puller of the strings. He was clad in black and as I gazed at him, he smiled. His face was mine, but his eyes we re jet black orbs, revealing nothing. The terrible Spirit cried aloud that this was a reflection of the My steries inherent in the Word Runa, and expressed in the Pentagram of Set, which conceals the Secret of the Universe. The Twenty-Fifth Aethyr - VTI Monday 9th August XXVIII AES, 1:06 a.m. I stood on a craggy, broken, black plain of rock be neath a starry night sky. Distant peaks were visible on the far horizon. A deep rumbling filled the Aethyr and the ground was rent asunder as a vast Serpent issued from it in wrath, unc oiling rapidly and swelling to fill the sky, Its flaming head seemingly lost in the heights far above. And still it came, the Beast of Revelation. Then I perceived my Daemonic Self, black-cla d, enthroned yet higher, above the Dragon's head.

Exoterically, the Aeon of the Dyi ng God still prevails, whereas I am in the splendour and majesty of the Aeon of Set. In the Aeon of the Goddess, Man is seen as a part of Nature, and se eks union with Her. In the Aeon of the Dying God, Man realizes his du al nature in the death/ rebirth experience but cannot reconcile both aspects and live in two worlds at once. In the Aeon of Horus, Man realizes that he can exercise his whole be ing. He now sees his progress as a process of growing up. Man takes respons ibility for himself. In the Age of Satan, Man realizes he can best approach his higher na ture by indulging his lower. By taking duality to extremes of Indul gence, Man sheds his hypocrisy, piety and false perspectives. In the Aeon of Set, Man Comes Into Being in his fullness. He percei ves his nature as a conscious God in his own right. He seeks to Xe per and Remanifest, aspiring to Runa and the mystery of the Omnijective Universe. The Beast is the source of Magical power. The God is the source of Magical wisdom. The Man is the conscious focus where these forces meet and find expression. The Setian recognizes and expresses himself in his entirety in the quest to Xeper. The Twenty-Fourth Aethyr - NIA Tuesday 17th August XXVIII AES, 1:20 a.m. I found myself in a green mea dow, full of flowers, on a radi ant day, all around me a blaze of glorious colour. Hills and trees fo rmed the beautiful countryside. With a musical noise, almost singing, the gorge ous, golden figure of Er os appeared before me, dazzling me with His beauty, enticing me. I perceived this as the Aethyr of external desire, the fixing and focus of the Erotic Crystalli zation Inertia. This is the perception of one's own aesthetic standards and ideals of beaut y, projecting without into the outside world, manifesting in the objective universe. This leads ultimately to the realization of Self-Love. Even as I watched, I saw more golden-haired youths walking towards me and glittering palaces and spires filled the horizon. I found myself sitting in the Bay Room Restau rant at the Grand Island , waited on by Lee and Chris , smiling and friendly. I perceived the dualistic pull of this Aethyr - the projection of the beauty within to the world without, but also the fact that ev en this beauty and pleasure, here in the Aethyr of Indulgence, descends from a more refined source."},{"pageNumber":1030,"pageContent":"The Twenty-Third Aethyr - TOR Tuesday 24th August XXVIII AES, 1:01 a.m. I found myself on a high platform built out of th e side of a tremendously tall tower. The sky above was black but full of st ars and the platform bore a well -crafted garden. Workmen were busily erecting a palace on this level area. Looking down below I saw the city from which the tower rose. Construction work was also under way there, the city constantly expa nding its boundaries. There were groups of men working at all levels of the tower. Looking up, I beheld a spiral flight of steps aroun d the exterior of the tower, leading up to a throne set upon what was curre ntly the highest pinnacle. I ascended and sat upon the throne, surveying the scene in its entirety from this remote vantage point. I then perceive d a Minotaur, clad in a short black cape, who declared this Aethyr as the place of coming to fruition, where the Will is translated into work, where the Self expands by expressing itSelf and manifesting its nature and tendencies in action. Here is the Will applied unto a goal. Without toil, without striving, w ithout progress, there can be no Xeper. We Come Into Being by expressing ourSelves. Wit hout new productivity of action, word and thought, how can we Remanifest? How can we perceive Runa more clearly and afresh if we do not strive to transcend our old boundaries? I then found myself in ancient Egypt, observing the scribes, the stone workers, the planners, the labourers. Together their vision, their art, their philos ophy, their monuments, have fascinated the world with mystery and magnificen ce for millennia. In what span will my Self- expression be measured? In TOR, the Self builds its tower, the expressi on of its own Will, its own abilities. Sometimes the tower is struck by lightning and the work is set back, but always it resumes in new Remanifestations. The Twenty-Second Aethyr - LIN Friday 3rd September XXVIII AES, 1:46 a.m. At first I seemed to be standing before a vast wa ll formed of tiny bricks. I then perceived that I was surrounded by such walls and that they were honeycombed with labyrinthine tunnels, trailing off in all directions. And each tunnel sprouted tunnels of its own. I then shrunk microscopically small and entere d a brick, wherein another maze of tunnels and twisting routes was formed of minutely smalle r bricks. And these bric ks, upon investigation, were a honeycomb of yet tinier bricks of their own. I then expanded to a size many thousands of times larger until the maze I had seen first of all was no larger than a brick itself.

The enormous figure of Baphomet dissociated it self from this mass, which pulsed to the vaguely discernible piping of flute-like noises. Baphomet regard ed me fixedly with its third eye and in an instant I perceived my own existe nce apart from the rest of the Universe. And Baphomet's existence is sustained only so l ong as I remain separate and perceive from without. Without differentiation and Self-awareness, there is no Life, merely a tendency to exist. Two black-robed figures then approached and proceeded to mummify me, preserving my existence as a separate being in my own right, apart from the rest of the Universe. Personal immortality is the ultimate goal of the Black Magician. The Twenty-First Aethyr - ASP Thursday 9th September XXVIII AES, 12:38 a.m. I was sitting in a cocooned position, floati ng in an empty, black immensity, a Void of potential. A strong wind blew thr ough the vastness. I felt very remote and detached from all else, but perfectly focussed in mySelf. I produced an obsidian mirror, in which I could perceive happenings in the objective universe even as I sat here, master of my subjective universe. I created a Grecian style palace of black ma rble around my naked soul as an Indulgence, thrilling in the absolute power I coul d wield in this subjective realm. I then mounted a black Solar ch ariot, drawn by four black hors es. We careered across the sky, black sparks flying from their racing hooves, and creation unfolded itself far below. In the Void of this Aethyr, a perfectly balanced potentiality, all surface ven eer was stripped away and I was mySelf, devoid of indoctrination, opinion or tem poral concerns. Here I was an absolute, capable of sparking a new creati on in which to Xeper and Remanifest. But throughout, the realization of Runa remained strong, with the consciousness that even this condition was not an ultimate truth. INTO THE AETHYRS - Part Two This paper represents my init ial results from experiments in skrying the second grouping of ten Aethyrs. As in the first ten, this section se ems to be neatly gathered in its own little grouping. As I related in my previous paper, th e Twenty-First Aethyr heralded a distinct change in 'flavour' and the nature of percepti on. This change crystall izes throughout these ten Aethyrs, culminating in ICH, the Eleventh Aethyr, at the brink of the Abyss. So what exactly is the nature of this cha nge? It basically involves a more detached perspective, as if I am an observer, but no l onger directly involved in or affected by that which I am observing. In re-reading these record s, they actually seem far more active and"},{"pageNumber":1032,"pageContent":"\"visually\" impressive than the lower ten, but this was not experientially the case. At the time of skrying each one, I felt myself to be much more detached and remote from anything that I saw. The sexual symbolism of OXO is a cas e in point: despite the sexually charged interaction with the forces of this Aethyr, I ex perienced no physical arous al at all, I merely observed and performed from an inner and detached point of view. I believe this is because I have progressed in ritual to the stage where the masks of the everyday persona are cast aside for the duration, and the actual Wo rking is performed with the pe rspective of the inner Self. This higher perspective is then reinforced by the lessons to be learned in each Aethyr. Some of the considerations presented here, such as the separateness of Self, are reiterated many times. The tone of much of the material is very lofty. It will require much future working to Remanifest some of these principles in my everyday life. But I feel my Xeper has already advanced a great deal from the point at which I commenced these experiments. Two points are noteworthy in particular as rega rds this section of my Aethyric Workings: I was Recognized to the Second Degree on 30th October XXVIII AES, and this has I believe had its due reflection and fresh emphasis on the succeeding Aethyrs. Also, the Twelfth and Eleventh Aethyrs utilized the Call of the Aet hyrs as presented in Casaubon's Dr. John Dee's Actions With Spirits , those previous having utilized th e Call from The Satanic Bible . I have felt much happier with this step closer to the original concep t of Enochiana. When I receive my copy of The Ruby Tablet , I intend to work with The Word of Set . This paper has been written immediately after co ncluding this section of the Working, prior to commencing work on the final series with the ritual of the Abyss. I append my Diary notes pertaining to each Aethyr in this section, and also a helpful summary of what I perceive as the unde rlying characteristics and initiat ory emphasis of each Aethyr in turn. Summary of the Aethyrs 20. KHR Patterns and cycles of manifestation. The Gi ft of Set. Self-evolution of the isolate intelligence. Separateness from the cosmic order. 19. POP Dualities.

Aethyr 20 - KHR Friday 17th September XXVIII AES, 12:56 a.m. At first I was plunging down a sort of \"Time Tunne l\" effect (as in the late Jon Pertwee/early Tom Baker Doctor Who opening sequence). This be gan to crystallize and take form as the DNA spiral, but this complex spiral coding wa s being woven and selected by an exterior agency - the Gift of Set! This also points to eugenics as a valid Black Magical application - if in the hands of ethi cal Black Magicians! I then saw the Universe as a mass of Serpents, sometimes as a vast Ouroboros, swallowing its own tail, then as a writhing nest of them, each one coiling around the others. I saw the Rings of Saturn, the cyclical action of the waves. But all the while I stood outside , looking in, aware of the sepa rateness of Self. But I also perceived the Magical Link that afforded me po wer over the objective universe, for all these cycles and patterns evolved and Remanifested in accordance with Will, the world out there reshaped and moulded by my desire. And I perceived the great lesson of this Aethyr to be that of disp assionate perception and continual Self-consciousness. This Aethyr was very different in 'flavour' and feeling from previous ones, more remote and aloof. Aethyr 19 - POP Friday 24th September XXVIII AES, 1:34 a.m. At first, I saw jagged splinters of glass projecting in all dir ections, from above, from below, and on all sides. A dangerous, ra zor-sharp passage led out of th is region. The sharp splinters even sliced the light, cutting it in to rainbow sparkles and rays. I then perceived cries of anguish amongst this potentially lethal ma gnificence and splendour. Tiny human figures were impaled upon the ja gged points of the glass fragments."},{"pageNumber":1034,"pageContent":"I then found myself at the ot her end of the passage, viewi ng a scene on a grassy hillside beneath a castle. People sat in the sunshine around a banque ting table, enjoying a splendid feast. But all around were moaning, tortured bod ies impaled on spikes. I viewed the court of Vlad the Impaler. Here were beauty and horror, life and death, si de by side - the relativ istic nature of human values. Selective attention was in prime example: the diners able to eat and chatter, shutting out the vision of agony all around; the victims so preoccupied with their own suffering that they could not appreciate the beauty of the day or the delicious spread on the table. Anybody can confine their atte ntion to what they want to see, or what they're told to see, and never perceive anything beyond those limits. It is a rare man who can see beauty and horror side by side. It is only the Black Magician who can intuit the horror inhe rent in beauty and the beauty inherent in horror. Aethyr 18 - ZEN Sunday 3rd October XXVIII AES, 1:03 a.m. I found myself standing between two enormous , jagged pinnacles of rock, facing across a plain to where a large, black Trapezohedr on Pyramid stood. The air resonated with the rhythmic beating of a deep gong. All around I saw dark shapes of men and women indulging in se xual activity of all descriptions, especially sado-masochistic. Moan s of agony and ecstasy disturbed the air. The Sabbatic Goat presented itse lf to me, and I kissed its hind quarters. It led me through the groaning throng into the Pyramid. Once within, the gong note became higher, of a different tone altogether. The inner chamber was also black, with a central Trapezoidal Alta r. A pearly light hovered above this, within which I saw a multi-faceted black sphere of obsid ian, within which in turn a silver averse Pentagram shone in delicate lines. This sight en raptured me, and I was overcome with awe, stirred with a strangely detached passion. The sou nds of lashes and orgastic cries still faintly reached me from without, but I heeded th em not, so rapt in ecstasy was I. Then rapture took me indeed and I flew directly upwards, wings unfolding from my shoulders. I flew on until I reached an enor mous figure of the utmost beauty, which I intuitively recognized as my own Daemon Self. I fe ll to sexual joy with this representation in a tremendous integration of Self. Of the feeble pleasures and pains of those below, I was unconcerned, their \"weak joys\" hold no interest. But I perceived the true initiatory value of pleas ure and pain in Self-knowledge and integration.

But to the Magician, properly centred in Self an d fully integrated, the feather of Maat is as a quill with which he can, if he Will, rewrite the cosmos. The Universe exists only because of imbalance. Or rather, all contending forces balance, but never at the same time, for such would be st agnation and decay. The Black Magician aims for Xeper, ever Becoming in new Remanifestations. We are of Life, not Death. Inequity is the rule. Hence 666's equation of \"Change = Stability.\" But the Black Magician recognize s the point, the still centre within, which is the Black Flame. This Self awareness is the Gift of Set.

Aethyr 16 - LEA Saturday 23rd October XXVIII AES, 12:18 a.m. I was in a desert, with a blazi ng electrical storm raging in th e night sky. Bolts of lightning kept striking the caps of the surr ounding pyramids, energizing them. From a detached perspective, I watched my self labouring, building a great black pyramid block by block. Although still open to the s ky, the inner sanctum possessed an awe and profundity and a powerful \"presence\" abode there. I continued to build, slowly and painstakingly aligning each block in accord with precise geometric laws. And I knew that even when the pyramid was fini shed, still there would be tasks to perform, maintaining it and guarding its approaches and wo rshipping in that innermost shrine. For this pyramid is the Eternal Self of the Black Magici an, raised to endure fo r ever, all public masks and ephemerals cast aside to rev eal the true God that is I. And the labyrinth leading to this central shrine of Godhead is patro lled by the Minotaur, the Beast who manifests my glory. And as I gazed forth from this perspective, I saw that a majestic statue of Set has been raised in the desert and I adored it. Then, with anot her flash of lightning, the heavens split apart, revealing the Pentagram of Set which shone serenely overhead. My Ka assumed the form of a great bat with a hu man head and soared aloft into the night sky. Aethyr 15 - OXO Sunday 7th November XXVIII AES, 12:41 a.m. I was in a bowl-like depression, a clearing with pi ne trees rising to th e top of the ridge all around me.

But even as this carried on, I sti ll retained an outside"},{"pageNumber":1036,"pageContent":"perspective, looking down upon the carry-on with a benign amusement. In some sense, the intensity of sex was the intensity of the Will in teracting with the Universe and the well-oiled muscles were actually those of the focussed mind. Nor did this pleasure hold any hint or hope of union, it was a pure Indulgence for its own sa ke, with each partner concerned primarily with their own pleasure and satisfaction, each us ing the other in full knowledge and consent. I looked up and saw the full Moon in a starli t sky overhead. It had grown dark. I then perceived that the depression in which I stood wa s in fact an enormous anus, the pine trees being the hairs around the opening. I grew to a size sufficient to \"interact\" with this opening. Here in OXO, the isolated Will can return once again to Indulge Self in interaction with not-Self, but with no further fear of contamination or dissolution of personal boundaries. This is th e Aethyr of applied Black Magic, the Adept Remanifes ting in the everyday world. At this stage, the Magician fears no transient attachments, having Come Into Being in his own completeness, all else is a fascin ating game of his own devising. Aethyr 14 - VTA Sunday 14th November XXVIII AES As with Crowley, this was an Aethyr of dar kness and I perceived no shapes or forms other than those specifically recorded here . No background was visible at all. I was in a black void, when I saw Worm Ourobor os surrounding me at a great distance, the Serpent biting its own tail and creating time and sp ace within its coils. It appeared as a sinewy Dragon of Oriental aspect. I then saw a Chimera roaring through the Aethyr , the classical combination of serpent, goat and lion. It spread its leathery wings and soared aloft, flames licking it Phoenix-like as it ascended. I felt myself ascending also, in a pillar of fire that stripped me of my mundane personality and concerns. As I rose, I was aware of a sensati on of being compressed an d tightened. But I then understood this to be a concentration rath er than a confinement, a focussing and intensification of my Will and awareness. I sat high above the earth, surrounded by an aura of blackness somehow deeper than the surrounding dark, almost as if my concentrated Self was within a black hole, too powerful to remain within the Universe at large. I feel th is sheds some light upon Set's creation of HarWer and his manifestation through a Void, for here I raised the Tcham Sceptre and created a vehicle in my own image to inte ract within the conf ines of not-Self, controlled from this isolated and detached viewpoint . The perception of Self as inherently unnatural was never stronger. Looking down, I perceived this position as bala nced atop a black pyramid, the Pyramid of Initiation, the progress of my Xeper to date.

The ground trembled to the rhythm of its breathing. I then found myself sitting at the edge of a fo rest, at a beach close to the sea on a tropical island paradise. A tall figure, hooded and wrappe d in a black robe, appeared beside me. I could discern pale features within the hood, and two gleaming cats' eyes. He announced himself as Belial, the Lord of this domain. As we watched, a monstrous Baphomet arose on the horizon, glimmering in the haze. Belial declared that Baphomet is the sum and total of manifestation. He is shaped to represent the entire cosmic order, but is possessed of a rebell ious Will that is against nature and the Black Flame burns upon his brow. Even so shall th e Black Magician subjugate the universal consistency to his Will. I enquired concerning NEMO, whom Crowley mentioned. Belial pointed out that NEMO means \"No man\" and 666 had warned of a delusi on and a danger here. The pious interpret this as a warning against Self, hence they seek to deny themselves and perish like dogs, as the Beast also foretold. But the Black Magician perc eives not a loss, but a gain. He is \"No man\" because he is greater than a man and he percei ves the Black Flame in all its naked glory. He has Become \"something more than human\" and counts himself not among men, but among gods. It is very peaceful here, but Be lial decreed that when the mind has rendered itself so balanced and tranquil, its true trial is just due to begin as it prepares to pit itself against the very inertia of the entire created Order. Aethyr 12 - LOE Sunday 5th December XXVIII AES, 1:17 a.m. I found myself among the thunder-clouds of a purple-black, storm-laden sky, surrounded by lightning. Then the distant sky changed from black to scarlet, as of blood, a whirling vortex of red radiance, from which raced the expected Chario teer of this Aethyr, similar to the Trump in the Thoth Tarot. I sensed an Eye watching from within the vortex. The Chariot came to a halt before me and the mail-clad warrior threw down his sword, commanding me to slay myself and shed my blood into the Grail. I refused, stating that my blood is my own and shall remain within my ow n Grail. The Grail is a mystery known only to each who bears it, and it is his alone to bear, separate and unique. He laughed, the Grail challenge being passed. And a Grail did indeed appear within my hand, containing my own blood, black an d congealed in places but tu rning rapidly to red, flowing life as the Black Flame burned w ithin the Grail, purifying th e blood. Thus, I sanctified my Self. The Blood and the Grail I made mine and mine alone. I then perceived myself in a su it of armour, similar to the Charioteer's.

Aethyr 11 - ICH Monday 20th December XXVIII AES, 12:52 a.m. As Crowley described, I approached a City, simi lar to Tolkien's description of Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard, but with nine tiers and nine pennants flying from the topmost turrets. And each tier of this City had its Lo rd or Lady who sat upon the Council. As I ascended, the air of watchfulness came upon me and I became aware of a howling wind that blew straight upwards from a pi t that gaped in the centre of all. The Chairman of the Council decl ared this pit as the Abyss, a condition that is within, not without. It is the dispersive and opposing forces of the Abyss that mainta in the equi librium of the Universe. The wards and guards of the City (of whom I had percei ved no sign) exist to ward off the unworthy, those who do not know thei r Selves. In order to approach the Abyss, knowledge of the Black Flame must burn strong : one's ab must be purified by Amn and the balanced perspective of Shuti is needed to navi gate one's true core through the maelstrom of that which is undisciplined not-Self and randomness. For the source of the Black Flame burns at the very centre of Being. Only the Elect of Set, able to apprehend their Selves, casting off all ex ternal concerns and influences, may approach here without distraction or harm by the dispersive forces of th e Universe that seek to reduce all to conformity. I felt no fear at the frontier of the Abyss, the Trapezoidal entrance to the Pit, only the awareness of an impending experience of Self. INTO THE AETHYRS - Part Three This final essay, covering the last batch of ten Aethyrs, is being written at the same time as the main body of my paper on the Aethyrs as a whole. This essay will hopefully set a few matters in perspective, and address the particul ar tone of those Aet hyrs from ZAX upwards. The first ten Aethyrs (30 to 21) dealt with th e position and function of the magician in the world, and the nature of the relationship betw een the objective and subjective universe. They tended to define basic ethics and attitudes, as well as drawing the initial distinction between Self and not-Self. Perhaps this is why the record of them is often so less immediate than those that followed. It may also explain (apart from the other obvious reason of initial inexperience with the Aethyrs) why these are more idiosyncratic than those that were to follow, reflecting far lesser images."},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"The middle series of ten tend to accentuate the Self, compelling the magician to forcefully recognize it as a thing unique and apart. Th ey explore the deeper, underlying relationships between Self and the Universe. They emphasize th e value of Self, that it is something which should remain unique. At these stages, the surf ace personalities are s een as toys and the essential, core Self begi ns to openly manifest. What of these final Aethyrs? The concept of th e Abyss serves as a Self-created barrier, a limitation and dividing line decreed by the Self, to keep out all that which is not a part of that Self. The Aethyrs beyond this poi nt are concerned only with Self . The Ninth Aethyr shows in its ghostly fashion that the Self may still travel where it Wills and interact as it Wills, but without risking any violation or dissolution of its own unique and individual essence. The Self can reach out to touch, taste and experience life in all its diversity, but without ever losing its own Selfness, that which makes it what it is. Xe per implies an evolution, a state of change and progress, whilst remaining essentially the same Being. This continual journeying and experiencing is illustrated in the Second Aet hyr, whilst the focussed core finds its expression in the First. It is a folly to view the Aet hyrs as a one-off experience. One does not reach the First Aethyr and then stop. Skrying the First Aethyr need not imply any particular Initiation. I firmly believe that the most novice Setian could e xperience something from even the highest Aethyrs; that something would be in proportion to their initiatory progress at that time. I am pleased with the progress I personally have ma de in this series of experiments. I am particularly pleased that the later Workings are so obviously superior to the now somewhat naive and awkward earlier Workings. But without those earlier Workings the later ones would never have been reached. Thus I make no ludicrou s claims for myself, othe r than that I did the best I could at the time, and I believe I have advanced my Xeper as a result. I continued in the use of the Nineteenth Ca ll from Casaubon's Dr. John Dee's Actions With Spirits , as the most accurate in my possession, an d having relocated my written copy of the Nineteenth Part of the Word of Set in English, I proceeded to recite this also after the Enochian invocation, in the fina l five Aethyrs, thus ensuri ng a correct philosophical stance from the outset. Having worked my way through the Aethyrs, the most prudent thing to do now would be to have a rest and spend a little time working in thos e other areas that currently interest me. This I intend to do. And then? I fully intend to return to the Aethyrs in a couple of years' time. I know for a fact that if I were now to assay th e earlier ones again, they would reveal so much more, and so much differently.

Aethyr 10 - ZAX Sunday 2nd January XXIX AES, 1:25 a.m. I experienced no perceptions of this as a par ticularly \"accursed\" Aethyr, as 666 describes it, although for reasons I shall refer to later in this write-up, it may be deemed responsible for the \"sorrows\" of Buddhism. I stood in the centre of a vast pl ain. At one side all was so rigi d and ordered as to be totally unmalleable, and at the opposing side was a roari ng chaos of destruction and disintegration as all things fell apart into their component quanta. And the ground moved, the stable area sliding ever into the maelstrom of dispersion, though new stable matter always sprang up to replace that which was broken down. As I focussed on the centre of the chaos, I beheld it as a vast, bestial maw, as in medieval depictions of the Gates of Hell. I then experienced a flash of near-ecstasy as I realized what I was beholding. Drawing further away, I realized that here again was the Serpent swallowing its own tail. The Serpent represents the entire Universe, devouring itself, but in so doin g it gains energy to grow, thus recycling and replacing what was lost. This is perhaps akin to the Buddhist idea of the Great Wheel being spun by a ruling Demon, a concept not so far removed from the Abyss and Choronzon of Crowley. The objective universe both creates and destroys, but mindlessly and impersonally."},{"pageNumber":1041,"pageContent":"ZAX is thus entropy, the force of decay and inev itable dissolution and disintegration that all things that belong to the cosmic order carry within themselves. It is also the regurgitation of expended raw materials. Decaying organic matter is a wonderful fertilizer for new growth. It is small wonder that RHP Magicians are so mo rtally afraid of the Abyss. Having identified themselves with the cosmic order, they share in its recycling and thus lose all that they have gained, sacrificing themselves on the Altar of Dispersion. But the forces of entropy are powerless against the Black Magician, who has isolated himself and rendered his Self separate and inviolab le. Although our bodies are ultimately prone to decay, we have created for our Selves an indepe ndent and eternal order. Ordered in and of our Selves, our psyches are not prone to external dispersion, but are Eternal in their separate and unique existence. In short, the Abyss is a menace only to those slaves of the universal consistency, who have refused the Gift of Set and sought to extinguis h the Black Flame. Since the Self-aware Black Magician is inherently unnatural, the natural fo rces of dispersion can have no power over him. This is symbolized perfectly in the Pentagram of Set, which does not touch the Self-devouring Circle in which it is depicted. Aethyr 9 - ZIP Monday 10th January XXIX AES, 12:57 a.m. At first I perceived only my Self suspended al one in a mist, which was grey, tinged with pink. I was wholly alone. I then realized that if I concentrated my attention, I c ould perceive the World beyond my Self as a thing detached and apart. Unattached to it , I could perhaps truly a ppreciate its beauty in its own right, and my naked mind soared incorp oreally over hills and forests, savouring all that it saw, but touching it but lightly. Still I was alone. Tall towers rose before me and I entered a fair city and Willed my Self to take form there. People teemed everywhere, living and laughing. I laughed with them, but they remained distant in essence, as did all else. Even in this throng, I was alone. For now the boundaries between Self and not-Self are well-established and defined, and I can enjoy life and interaction without tainting my Se lf. They have become a pleasurable pursuit, an Indulgence, and remain ever apart from the essential I. I am alone. Yet these Willed interactions with the Universe serve to constantly re veal and emphasize new facets of I, and as I walk my Path and Indulge my Self, so I see reflected the permutations of that Self in all its various guises.

Aethyr 8 - ZID Monday 17th January XXIX AES, 12:37 a.m. I found myself in the centre of a vast cosmic tr iangle, its tips touchi ng the very boundaries of manifestation.

There then appeared to be thre e great triangles, with the Eye at the overlapping centres, all set at different angles to each other. And each tria ngle had its own three eyes, each at one angle of the triangle, so that the Ni ne were focussed in the One, their all-encompassing perception Remanifesting in the still centre, which was tim eless and immortal, existing apart from these interactions. And this is the vision of the Eye of Leviathan, that ageless and absolute sentience against which all else must be measured. Leviathan is immortal and eternal; the Universe is transitory. Even so with the Black Magician. The core Self must Remanifest, Coming into Being as an ageless Intelligence akin to Leviathan, th e constant around which all else revolves. The perspective is enlarged to perceive all th ings from all angles. All things are measured relative to the absolute Self, never vice versa. Th is is the goal of the Ma gician: to see with the Eye of Leviathan. Aethyr 7 - DEO Monday 7th February XXIX AES, 12:51 a.m. I found myself in an expanse of infinite Dark ness, warm, still and comforting. I beheld before me a giant rose of black petals, exuding a scen t so subtle and beautiful that it pierced the heart. I reached out for it, my hand enormous in the black vastness. The detail of each petal was exquisite, and the rose contained de w like a clear honey, sweet and rich. I realized that this was a Self-created beaut y, drawn from the depths of my own soul. All standards, all worth, are mine to define. I contemplated landscapes, but perceived no so lid shapes, only geometric figures, lines, angles and curves. For these are the seeds of manifestation, the me ntal tools of the Magician. There are no colours here, only black. For this is a deep mystery, sh rouded in the Eternal Darkness of the Self, concealed from the prof ane. The only other tints (subtly discerned, inwardly perceived, without altering the Blackness ) are the silver hue th at hints of the quiet, beautiful presence of Set, and the pulsing red of my own heartbeat, my Being. Aethyr 6 - MAZ Tuesday 15th February XXIX AES, 1:33 a.m. As with the previous couple of Aethyrs, th e emphasis was upon Darkness, with shapes and angles. I seemed to pass through an enormous Ring, in to a Void space. Here I saw an inverse Pentagram traced before me, outlined in silver."},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"The Pentagram suddenly spun horizontally throu gh 90 degrees, revealing another, hitherto hidden, Pentagram at right angles to it. As one Pentagram was viewed face on, the other was seen from the side and was thus effectively invisible, the outline possessing no thickness. These Pentagrams then struck me as compri sing Nine Angles, since they shared a common lower point, and as they started to rapidly spin, the two sets of four upper points outlined the flickering image of a flas hing, gyrating Trapezohedron. Never before had I perceived phi and the Golden Ratio in such beauty. Dare I label this perception of the Pentagram/Trapezoid as the Golden Gateway? I passed through this vortex into a place of deepest Darkness and tranquillity. I followed the trace of a red tongue of flame until I came to where a Black Flame burned upon an Altar. I merged with this Flame, but remained my Self . This Altar seemed to be a monolithic stone Trapezohedron (at least I sensed it as such; I did not see it in a 'visual' manner). I then saw the image of Set, outlined in a pale silver glow. I sensed this image as a hieroglyph indeed, but a genuine formless presence was also with me, an Intelligence who was warm and deep. There was no communication apart from a pleasant and profound touching of minds (which in spite of its gentlene ss shook me to the core) and I withdrew for the present by the way I came. I understand, writing this afterwards, that this experience has affected me profoundly. I also understand that there is more to come. Aethyr 5 - LIT Sunday 20th February XXIX AES, 12:07 a.m. I was sitting quietly in a Void, calm and unt roubled. This space was Self-contained and inviolate, and was bordered by the Ouroborous, Self-created boundary and definition of my Self. Any seeking to assault the sanctity of my Self would encounter only the Dragon that devours eternally, for the rest sta nds apart from the Universe. I was in an environment totally ordered and defi ned by my Self, separate from all that is not- Self. From here I can manifest my Will in all pl aces and at all times, for I am apart from the machinery of the cosmic order. I am focused. Focus is a peculiarly appropria te word for my condition, for it can be both a verb and a noun. I am the focus around which all else revolves, in the presence of which all else fades and blurs into the background. And I am focussing, shifting my Will to Remanifest in new situations and panoramas as I desire. I am active and I am passive. I am the focuser, I am focused, and I am the focus. I sense the Black Flame burning hot . This is another expression of Xeper in its essence: how to change and Become, yet simultaneously remain the same Being? This Aethyr is still and tranquil, moreso than any previous, but there still remain others, and I feel this is a drawing-in pr ior to new Remanifestation.

None of th ese could touch my essential core, and I simply observed with a detached intere st, able to intervene or not as I so Willed. I then withdrew into my Self and sat in a l ong hall, upon a pedestal. Other shadowy figures sat on other pedestals, representing other Black Ma gicians who have sought out the mysteries of Self. I perceived Set as an awesome consciousne ss permeating the Universe, the Black Flame apportioned according to his Will, flickering in Darkness in carefully chosen places throughout the randomly ordered cosmos. I then perceived the Prince of Darkness in an as pect akin to Lovecraft's 'Umr At-Tawil, the Prolonged of Life, the Gate, offering the entire expanse and experience of Self to those who dare. A reflection perhaps upon the nature of the Red Magus, who shall behold only Leviathan. In order to annihilate the cosmic order and perceive the absolute, it must first be necessary to order one's Self, by one's own Will. The warning of Belial should not be taken in vain, the boundaries of Self-refe rence must be established and maintained. Then the old can be swept away, leaving a Void in which a truer vision may manifest. The Black Magician fears not even if the entire Universe be annihilate d. For he is his Self alone, and not touchable by its catastrophe. His Immortality is within his Self, the Black Flame at his core, and dependent upon none other. Aethyr 3 - ZOM Sunday 27th February XXIX AES, 1:08 a.m. The Aethyr was full of raging red fire, with cr acking great flashes of scarlet lightning that ripped through the heart of me and then shot through the Ae thyr. This was a terrifying spectacle at first, until I realized that it wa s all according to my implicit Will, my magical quest, and that I was unharmed by the Inferno. I recalled that the Black Flame turns Red thr ough the process of Initia tion, and that the Red Magus shall destroy his Universe and behold Leviathan alone. Sure enough, the Flame burned away all else, leav ing only my Self in a great Darkness. Then I seemed to perceive dimly the Dragon in symbolic form, sometimes as a vast Serpent, seemingly remote, but then a single scale would become too huge to behold in its entirety. Here, with the natural law swept away by the bl asting breath of the Dragon, the concept of a new, Self-created order beckoned, unfolding from the undulating coils of Leviathan, making new shapes in the Darkness according to the Magical Will, an act of re-creation. As Leviathan is the absolute, so must the Magician Become, unto himself.

Joyner, and his references to the TARDIS. For perhaps the first time, I really und erstand the significance of this fantastic vessel, its ability to be piloted to all places in all times, whilst itse lf being a part of none of them, but existing outside in its own self-sustaining dimensi on, interfacing with the Universe through its materialized shell, able to slip in and out of manifestation according to the Will of its operator. Even so, the Ship of a Million Years, a thi ng from outside of Space-Time, sails serenely through the Universe, responding to its helmsman's Will. The mind of the Black Magician can reach out and focus anywhere, anytime, upon an ything, perceiving it simultaneously from all possible angles, under Will.

I was outside. Outside time. Outside sp ace. There was only I, Self-defined. If I wished, I could view the Universe from outside, as in ARN, looking down upon it. I could dip into it as I Willed, as a diver into a swim ming pool, for my own Indulgence. It is my playground, and I formulate the rules of play. But here I am apart, focused and inviolate. My attachments and con cerns are zero. I think clearly and precisely, without ex ternal distraction. I am at peace in this state, and can Remanifest as I wish, operating within the Un iverse to further my own Xeper, Indulging my Self. For Xeper does not finish here, this is a re sting point, a core, a consolidating focus. But I have nurtured my Self and remain finite.

Comparisons This brief discussion is a comparative look at how others have approached the Enochian Aethyrs (and indeed Enochiana in general). Fe edback and discussion are important facets of the Black Magical quest, even though the actual Wo rk of that quest is usually carried out in isolation. I have more than once had the e xperience of a fellow In itiate discovering some buried treasure in my own Work that I had not personally noticed before. a) Aleister Crowley - Ipsissimus Crowley's The Vision and the Voice is probably the first place to look in any investigation of the Aethyrs. His records are so meticulous and exhaustive, not to mention so profound and beauti ful, that they are beyond compare. Crowley was to my knowledge the first to sit down and skry the Thirty Ae thyrs in this fashion, and his"},{"pageNumber":1046,"pageContent":"record of the experience is the earliest avai lable (if anybody is aware of any earlier work, please let me know!). As is inevitably the case, Crowley's visions reflect his own personal ity and philosophy to a large degree. The skrier alwa ys perceives his visions thr ough his own subjective lenses. Nevertheless, many of the concepts are far more general and expansive than those tied directly to the Aeon of HarWer, and the Ini tiatory programme descri bed in his writings persists in very similar form into the Temple of Set. As is always the case in his writings (reflecting the \"strange and fitful presence\" of HarWer), Crowley' s references to the Self are decidedly ambiguous and contradict ory. It is as if he never r eally decided whether he was a Black or White Magician (though his practice, lifestyle and enorm ous ego suggest the former). I had read The Vision and the Voice two or three times prior to commencing my own work with the Aethyrs, and it has inevitably coloured my own perceptions. This is quite explicitly the case in one or two examples in the two ear lier decads. But my visions are generally my own, and the emphasis is usually quite di fferent to that which Crowley placed. It may be interesting to compare Crowley's summary of the Aethyrs with my own. Whilst obviously very different, common patterns in In itiation should reasonably be expected. b) Adept Eardley W. Scott - Adept Scott ha s had some of his Work with the Aethyrs published in the Trail of the Serpent and I have read some of his impressions which afforded new insights and perspectives. Adept Scott has a distinct style which is altogether different from both Crowley and myself, and his skill in isolating and anal yzing the fundamental Initiatory value of each Aethyr has been very inspiring. c) Ipsissimus James Lewis - Ipsissimus Lewis Wo rked with the lower Aethyrs in a series of Apep Workings (published in the Book of Leviathan ), the purpose of whic h was to discern the fundamental principles and dire ction of the Order of Leviatha n. It was during the course of these Workings that the Order's interest in Immortality was sp ecifically emphasized. The Apep Workings are of tremendous value, not only in their relevance to the Order of Leviathan, but also because they represent the first ordered sequence of practical Work with the Aethyrs which I have encountered with a specific magical purpose in mind. Generally (as in my own case) the Aethyrs are skryed in th eir given order to obtai n a general overview of the process of Initiation. Ipsissimus Lewis demonstrated with remarkable effect how the Aethyrs can also be sequentially addressed fo r a fixed and specific purpose, in this case information pertaining to the inte rests of the Order of Leviathan. This aspect of the Aethyrs is very novel and I find its implications very exc iting in bringing the vagaries of Enochian Magic more fundamentally into the Wille d framework of the Black Magician. d) Ipsissimus Michael A. Aquino - As related in The Church of Satan , Dr. Aquino discovered the Casaubon version of the Enochian Keys whils t a Magister in the Church of Satan. In the documents reprinted in his history of that or ganization, Dr. Aquino describes how he used the Casaubon Key to skry one of the Aethyrs and in so doing found it qualitatively different from the Keys given in the Satanic Bible . This realization culminated in the reconstruction of the genuine, unadulterated Enochian Keys and thei r Setian interpretation, as presented in the Word of Set ."},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"e) Dr. John Dee & Edward Kelly - Dr. Dee's pa pers contain many pious discussions with and revelations from \"angels,\" but it does not seem th at either he or Kelly ever skryed the Aethyrs in the manner that Crowley did. Rather, their spir itual records seem to consist of a far cruder reliance upon their own prayers, the whole set wi thin a Judaeo-Christian framework. What is interesting, however, is the manner in which each Aethyr is given governance over specific parts of the earth, a far more materialistic no tion. This may add further authority to Magus LaVey's application of the Keys, as mentioned below. f) Anton Szandor LaVey - Magus LaVey \"Satanized\" the Keys and presented them in the Satanic Bible as the \"language of magici ans.\" His work here was unique, in that as far as I am aware this was the first time that anybody had actua lly ascribed materialistic meanings to the Keys, allocating each Key to sp ecific varieties of magical operation for specific and tangible results, here and now, an interesting new slan t, which provided anot her factor in drawing Enochiana into mainstream magical practice and out of its hitherto vague and pious woolliness. But his materialistic applicati on of the Keys, abhorrent in the eyes of traditionalists of the Golden Dawn school, is actually probably more in accord with the original motives of Dee and Kelly, as mentioned above. g) Christopher S. Hyatt PhD & Lon Milo DuQuette - Hyatt and DuQuette recently published their Enochian World of Aleister Crowley: Enochian Sex Magic , in which they reprinted Crowley's distillation of the Golden Dawn Enochian papers, Liber Chanokh , and provided some lucid and coherent comment aries and elucidations thereon. They also add some essays of their own on the combining of Enochiana with sex magical techniques. Although they do not present any record of Aethyric Workings in this book, they do place a lot of things in common sense perspective and describe simple, logical methods of Working. They also (most importantly) stress the need to do one's own Work in these areas rather than being constricted by that of other people and thinking that you ha ve gone wrong if you fail to perceive the same things that they did. h) Gerald & Betty Schueler - I have read the first five of the Schueler's Enochian cookbooks (having flung my arms above my head in horro r and fled at the sight of their latest, The Enochian Workbook ). There are two major problems with their work. The first is their piety and White Magical protestations. Their empha sis upon extinguishing the ego, and losing the Self is anathema as far as I am concerned. But this self-destructive emphasis is presented as irrevocable fact, not the opinion that it so obviously is. Dire re tributions are warned against those who dare tread the Aethyrs with any form of intact and individual psyche - in a word, piffle. The second protestation against their books is their habit of cataloguing in precise detail the things which are to be seen in each Aethyr. The Enochi an magician is led to believe that these (much distorted and co rrupted - Schueler's interpretation of the City of Pyramids is the exact opposite of Crowley's !) bland and mechanical extractions from Crowley's writings are the only valid visions, and if he sees anything else, he must be doing something wrong. Of all the Schuelers' books, Enochian Physics is the only one that has anything to commend it, although it must be read very carefully indeed and not accepted without many pinches of salt along the way. i) Patrick J. Zalewski - Zale wski is a New Zealander who ha s lately been championing the traditional Golden Dawn system. His work is in teresting if only because rather than simply regurgitate what has been said before by dozens of Regardie imitators, he instead explores the deeper complexities of the system and endeavou rs to present new material, and previously"},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"unpublished documents. Whilst his work is absurdly convoluted from the Setian Black Magical standpoint, one thing that cannot be doubted is the stre ngth of Zalewski's dedication and integrity. His Enochian contributions are interesting in shedding a fresh perspective on the Golden Dawn techniques of skrying, and for their presentation of th e Heptarchia Mystica, the planetary side of the Enochian system which is often overlooked. j) Robert Turner - Turner, a Dee scholar, is noteworthy for having reprinted Dee's papers on the planetary-based Heptarchia Mystica, along with convincing eviden ce that Casaubon's (and most people since Casaubon) plate of the Holy Table was reversed by a printer's error. His little book also contains an inte resting biography of Dee and a history of Mortlake to the present day. This is very much a book for scholar s and the dedicated only, but interesting in its way. k) The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn - Th eir claim to fame in Enochiana lies in being the first to transform the Dee papers into some form of coherent, workable system. In so doing, many details were added to force it into alliance with their brand of Qabalism, and the resultant was a bit of a complicated mess, overl y prejudiced to suit their own preconceptions. But this was nonetheless the essential springbo ard for Crowley's Work and the resulting resurgence of interest in all things Enochi an, with all the attendant advantages and disadvantages. Conclusion There is an abundance of Enochian material av ailable today. Read th rough the ads in any mainstream occult paper and you will see ever y two-bit hack offering correspondence courses in it. Regrettably, Enochiana seems to se ll books, so we have no choice but to see it prostituted. At the moment, it is a fad. All of the authors listed above have somethi ng to say on the subject. The serious researcher will feel bound to at least glance at them all. But the final arbiter on all things Enochian must be the Word of Set . Essential reading on the subject I would class as the Work of Setians, plus Crowley and probably also LaVey for his unique reappraisal of the system. D ee's own records are also of interest in establishing the roots of the system, although their tone and th e print quality of the facsimile (I can't look at an \"f\" without seeing it as \"s\" now!) make it a labour of love. As for the others? Take them or leave them. Self and the Universe in Enochian Magic It will be evident that the Aethyrs exhibit an often dynamic view of th e balancing of various polarities, and a correct perspec tive of opposites. Aleist er Crowley's Work also suggests this, and even Schueler perceives the Aethyrs as highly dualistic. Within the context of the Temple of Set, the Or der of Shuti is particularly interested in the study of opposites and polarities, and in looking at the Order's details in the Crystal Tablet , their prime concern seems to be that which is indeed of most significance in Enochian work: the distinction between Self and not-Self."},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"The Aethyrs are inherently Left-Hand Path in essence, stressing a di stinction between the Magician and what he observes. This is evident from the Vision and the Voice also if it is read at face value, and is also discernible in Schue ler's writings, although he tries to conceal it and \"spiritualize\" it away by insi sting upon oblivion of Self and union with the Universe. It may be that my Workings to date have st ressed this distinction at the expense of other learning. I was not a Setian when I commenced this series of Workings, hence my middle experiments may have been over-compensation in order to establish the whys and wherefores of basic Setian philosophy in my own subjective universe. I certainly believe this to be so, hence my conviction that any Magician's Workin g with an Aethyr will reflect his initiatory status at that time and will focus upon those aspects of the Aethyr most pertinent and conducive to the Magician's immediate and long term Xeper. This possible over-compensation apart, the fact re mains that these Workings have stressed the principle of Isolate Intelligence. The Black Magician has Come Into Being in his own right. One interesting perspective that appears partic ularly in the last decad of Aethyrs is a concentration upon the nature and f aculties of the Core Self to the exclusion of the Universe in any form. Instead, the potential s and possibilities of that Self within a Universe of its own devising are stressed - some insights into the Being of the Red Magus, perhaps? Indeed, at this remotest focus of Self, the core \"I\" seems to be distinct in its way from both the objective universe and the subjec tive universe, although able to act within and through either in order to explore its own pr ocess of Becoming. Obviously th e subjective universe is more easily acted upon and through than the objective un iverse. Even as the Self is not to be identified with the outer body, home, employme nt and social engagements, so it is not identical to its memories, emotions and personali ties. These latter are its tools and means of expression in the subjective universe as the form er attributes are in the objective universe. Obviously, without these qualities we are impoverished, but th ey are nonetheless the transient and changeable aspects of the Self, those part s which the Intelligence uses and adapts and evolves in the process of Xeper. It strikes me that this concept may be sim ilar to that expressed by Magus Flowers in his evocative term \"the omnijective universe,\" wh ere both objective and s ubjective aspects alike are seen as vehicles for expression for the Ma gician, without identification or merging with any part thereof. Potential Further Research Into Enochian This series of Workings, and this resultant pape r, have been reflective of a lot of changes in my life, and are a record of my Xeper. As a result of this work, I am now experiencing a significant Remanifestation, a Willed analysis and integration of all that I have been through, resulting in a new Becomi ng, a new state of Being. It will take a while for all of the ramificati ons of this Remanifestation to become fully apparent, but some evidence of its occurrence li es in the fact that I now view my Working records of all Aethyrs from 30 to 11 inclusive from a different perspective (no doubt the same will also become true of the last decad, but at present they still remain fresh and vibrant in my mind and have not been fully integrated and anal yzed to the same extent yet). What seemed full of profound meaning and insight at the ti me now seems very basic. This is not to"},{"pageNumber":1050,"pageContent":"undervalue the experiences, it simply evidences that I have progressed since, and I would be very worried if this was not the case. What does this imply? Mainly that if I was to go back to the Thirtieth Aethyr now and repeat the Working of TEX, referring back to my previo us notes, I am sure th at Aethyr would have so much more to reveal to me that it would almost be beyond recognition. The Aethyrs unfold to us as much information as our initiatory status at the time will permit us to understand. Adept Scott has likened the Aethyrs to a delib erate compartmentalization of the mind by the Magician, in order to isolate and explore its various facets, bringing them all under conscious control. As this Willed control increases, so do the faculties of our minds. In other words, the human mind responds to stimulus, the Gift of Set increases with use. This is expressed in the second premise of the Temple's General Informational Letter: the psychecentric consciousness can evolve towards its own divinity through deliberate exercise of the intelligence and Will, a process of becoming or coming in to being whose roots may be found in the dialectic method expounded by Plato and the conscious exa ltation of the Will propos ed by Nietzsche. One potential for further Enochian work would th erefore be to repeat the Workings with the Aethyrs over a period of time (as indeed I intend to do, but not until a couple of years have passed at least - there are, after all, many other aspects of magic to investigate also!). There is no end to Self-exploratory work of this natu re. The boundaries of Runa have expanded far beyond their original limits, but th ey still entice, and that horizon becomes ever more enticing with every step of the magical path. My Xeper continues, and many Rema nifestations still lie ahead. Although I have little time for the Golden Dawn system of pyramid squares, etc., the Enochian Watchtowers may nevertheless be used in their raw form for work in exploring the Elemental polarities. Perhaps some enterprising Initiate may convert these later additions to the Enochian system into a symbolic key usable by the Temple of Set at some stage, rearranging the colours, deities and attributions to reflect a less \"white light\" scenario. One idea that crossed my mind in my Church of Satan days was to attribute Baphomet and the four Princes of Hell to the various Elemental combinat ions of the squares, or perhaps deities from the Cthulhu mythos? There are plenty of possibilities for an inve ntive mind to rehabilitate the Golden Dawn Enochian teachings. One aspect of Enochiana that hardly anybody at all seems to have touched upon are its planetary correspondences and deities, as set dow n in Dee's Heptarchia Mystica. I did at one point loosely integrate these with the Sumeri an Zone from the Simon \"version\" of the Necronomicon . It was a tradition in the Church of Satan to always include an appropriate Enochian Key in a ritual working, and Magus LaVey codified each Key in the Satanic Bible according to its application in either operative or illustrative magi c. This is a tradition I have adhered to since Enochiana interests me so much (and because, through Work, I have basically made the system my own and internalized it). Given D ee's attribution of each Aethyric Governor to specific parts of the globe, the LaVey usage seems justified in some ways. The use of Enochiana in operative magic is unheard of in Right-Hand Path systems, and thus we have virgin territory here to experiment with. Ultimately, the Enochian system is no better nor worse than many another magical codification. The real magic, the focusing pow er, is the Will of the Black Magician. The"},{"pageNumber":1051,"pageContent":"means whereby that Will is directed and applied is certainly not arbitrary, but is nevertheless largely immaterial. A seasoned a nd well-read magician can as easily work through Enochiana, Qabalah, Runes, Sigils or any other focusing symbol. As Ipsissimus Lewis is so fond of saying, it is vital to always remember that \"u s is it.\" The primary interest of Enochian Workings to the Temple of Set is the Word of Set , and the meaning thereof, for this is not an archaic rehash of esoteric mumbo-jumbo, but a philosophy and approach of central significance to the Elect of Set a nd his Aeon. Apart from that, the individual Setian can either take Enochian or leave it; th e important thing is to strive for knowledge, understanding and power of the Self and the Universe.

The reader is referred to the book Potpourri - The Art of Fragrance Crafting , published by Frontier Cooperative Herbs. In add ition, comments of a practical nature are from my own experience with all the substances me ntioned. I have rearranged the order of the classes of fragrances in what s eems to be a logical sequence. Classification: V2 - C1H - 1 Author: Ruth Nielsen II° Date: October, XXV Publication: Originally given as the \"A roma Workshop\" at the Set-XI Conclave Revision: The appendix on \"Sources\" wa s updated as of October 1, XXVI Subject: Oils and Aromas Reading List: 23"},{"pageNumber":1054,"pageContent":"There has been an increasing use of aroma in r ecent years for personal enhancement, and also for the more serious pursuits of healing both physically and emotionally. Traditionally, aroma has also been used for religious purposes, t hough few people realize th is. My arrangement of the fragrance classes reflects this use. A number of researchers have come up with cl assifications that differ from those given here. There is little in the aroma industry that is accepted as standard when it comes to uniform classification. Professionals tend to accept a classi fication system that fits the use they make of aroma and the products they prefer. The consumer is wise to keep this in mind. Another factor in the commercia l use of aroma is the failure of manufacturers to label products to identify which of th e ingredients are natural and wh ich are synthetic. In either case they can be fit into the various classes gi ven here, but there is of ten a decided difference in the effect, especially to those who are quite sensitive or allergic. From a practical focus, the aroma classes used here are easy to work with as there are only four. This has proven to be satisfactory for o ccasional personal or magickal use and small scale production. In the rest of this presentation, the classes will be referred to by the numbers below that precede the key words, not the Jellin ek class numbers. The Jellinek class reference is supplied for those who wish to research furt her into the books liste d in the bibliography. 1. relaxing-sedative - Jellinek class 2 2. stimulating-physical - Jellinek class 3 3. stimulating-mental - Jellinek class 4 4. euphoric-sexual-emotiona l - Jellinek class 1 A brief description of each cla ss follows. Where the information is available, the fragrances are rated on a scale of 1 to 10 for \"intensity of odor\", 1 being the least and 10 being the strongest. There are other scales, such as the ra te of volatility, which wi ll only be referred to in a few cases. It ranges from 1 to 100 in an at tempt to provide a wide margin for measuring the rate at which an aromatic oil evaporates. Th e least volatile is at the 100 end of the scale, and the most volatile near one. Volatility does not necessarily equate with flammability, so do not make the mistake of thinking that an oil w ith a high volatile number isn't flammable. Treat all of them as if they are until you are familiar with them. Class 1: Relaxing - Sedative The fragrance materials that belong in this cla ss are any plant substan ce that creates a sweet, heavy or heady aroma. These are called \"narcotic\" or \"intoxicating\" by Jellinek, from the old usage meaning \"sleep inducing\" or \"influen cing one to slowly give up one's senses\", implying that one also loses cont rol. The actual response is that the senses are indeed dulled, physical reactions are slowed, one feels lazy and relaxed, and a feeling of languor is created. Imagine walking through a rose garden in a la rge botanical display. Inhale deeply of that heavy sweet aroma. Do you feel like you are re ady to take on the day, or do you feel like laying in the grass and cuddling? This cla ss is often considered a romantic group of fragrances, because of the receptive, passive m ood they create. Cleopatra knew this when she covered the floors many inches deep with roses to welcome Mark Antony, or so legend has it."},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"This class of aromas, however, are scents that in large whiffs can sw iftly bring on nausea or headache. It is no small wonder how ancient peop les could have used such large quantities of perfume to, for example, drench awnings and sa ils with the substances , and not succumb to the unpleasant side effects als o. It makes one question the trut h of historical legends. The process of steam distillation of essential oils from plant materials was not discovered, however, until the 10th century. Prior to that time, perfumes were powders or gums mixed with bees wax and pressed oils, and worn on the body as ointments. Plant material wa s also macerated and placed in warm oils, wine or even water. Flowers and spices were preferred for this. The resulting fragrant liquid was poured over the person, or one stepped into a bath of it. None of these materials can compare ounce for ounce with the potency of essent ial oils, yet when one is familiar with the methods for making them, some very fragrant concoctions can result. Essential oils included in this class are listed below. Some of these oi ls will be listed in another class also, as they cross-over in charact eristics. The oils marked with an asterisk (*) were available for workshop partic ipants to sniff if they so chose, at the Set-XI workshop. Those marked with a hyphen (-) are also recomm ended, but samples were not available. The \"*S\" (synthetic) fragrances were also available for workshop pa rticipants. Specific directions and recipes for using some of the \"*\" and \"*S\" aromas will be found in the recipe section. Neroli (orange blossom) - difficult to find, the mo st expensive and alluring of fragrances, derives from the bitter orange. O dor intensity 5, volatility 79. Rose Attar rivals Neroli in fame for price a nd alluring qualities. Due to price I have never tested either but encourage anyone who gets the chance to take it. At tar is also an essential oil, but not always produced by steam distillation. Rose absolute and other floral absolutes are less e xpensive than the above, but still in the higher price range for most people. Odor intensity 7, volatility 99. Sweet Orange (*) - the most inexpensive of natu ral aromas, it is cheaper than many synthetics, disperses quickly, is very light, and has a pleasant r eal orange aroma. Ylang-Ylang (*) - similar to a spicy rose - a Chines e flower; odor intensity of 6, volatility 91. Anise (*) - similar to licorice Vetiver (*) - heavy and similar to aged Patchouli Sweet Birch (*) - a candy like smell Clary Sage (*) - heavy like Patchouli and Vetiver, odor intensity of 5, volatility 82. Peru Balsam (*) - a mellow resinous coniferous aroma Sandalwood (*) - similar to musk with a slight re sinous and floral odor, odor intensity of 5, volatility 100? Patchouli (*) - heavy resinous like o il, easily overused, odor inte nsity of 5, volatility 100?"},{"pageNumber":1056,"pageContent":"Myrrh (*) - similar to Patchouli, Vetiver and Clar y Sage, odor intensity of 7, volatility 100? Rose Geranium (*) - distilled from the scented leav es, odor intensity of 6, volatility 87. Amber (-) - hard to find - a waxy substance sim ilar to a musk and patchouli blend. Amber used in jewelry is a hard stone-like petrified fo rm of pine resin, of varying shades of yellow. Amber as a fragrance material is said to be a fossil resin. However, there is confusion in the literature regarding it, and it is in fact an aged resin collected fr om trees in tropical jungles. It is used as a fixative in perf umes in place of the rarer amberg ris, which it resembles. (See the section on recipes for explanation of fixative, and see the \"Sources of Supply\" appendix for information on where to purchase.) Chamomile (camomile) (-) - a rare oil found as an abso lute, it is expensive, odor intensity of 9, volatility 47. Rose (*S) - a synthetic rose very similar to the real thing Ambergris (*S) - a synthetic imitating the substa nce by the same name, produced by sperm whales which at times were found washed up on beaches. Musk (*S) - a synthetic form of the substance produced by the musk deer. Class 2: Stimulating - Physical This class of fragrances is very familiar to peop le without most of us realizing it. The scents in this class are often startl ing, overwhelming, or violent in their action even in small amounts. Commonly a few whiffs will clear sinuses and cause noses to run. In minute amounts these scents are stimulating and give one a sense of physical well being. They are described as being refreshing, sh arp, clear and piercing. Recall the smell of Vick's VapoRub, Ben Gay, & Mentholatum. These make heavy use of the oils of eucalyptus, mint, camphor, and wintergreen. Another group of familiar products are the skin care products, such as Noxema \"medicated\" skin creme. The \"medication\" refers to these oils, traditionally considered to be medicinal, being used in the composition of the product. The oils used are believed to be antibacterial, although recent research shows that such an e ffect is reduced when the oils are used in combination. Any of the aroma oils are comp lex in themselves, and even a knowledgeable perfumer chemist runs the risk of creating ine ffective combinations or the totally strange one. For medicinal purposes such as the antibacterial action, the oils are be st used separately. As a perfume however, it is difficult to find a combination of this class that is good. Some people find the mints and bergamot to be the least overwhelming. Bergamot is often effectively used with Relaxing - Sedative aromas . Thuja Cedar and Bay are next in preference for their pleasing qualities, both being favorites for winter holidays. Generally the Stimulating - Physical class of aromas need the addition of other classes to transform them into really special perfumes. Lavender and Bergamot are exceptions, often being used alone. Essential Oils included in this class are the following:"},{"pageNumber":1057,"pageContent":"Eucalyptus (*) - totally obnoxious if more than a drop is used, rates an 8 in odor intensity, 5 for volatility. Lavender (*) - Perhaps the most widely used an d appreciated of all aromas. Yardley's English Lavender soap available at Xmas time is an example. Odor intensity 4, 85 for volatility. Thuja cedar (*) - a pleasing \"soft\" but bright cedar aroma. Citronella (*) - inexpensive and widely used in lamp oils and candles, especially for outdoor use as an insect repellent. Bergamot (*) - this oil comes from the rind of a fr uit which grows in It aly, not the herb (Bee Balm). Intensity 4, Volatility 55. Rosemary (*) - a famous oil used for medicinal pur poses, similar to eucalyptus in aroma. Odor intensity 6 (but the samples available s eem that this number should be much higher), volatility 18. Spruce (*) - sharp and piercing but not bad in small amounts. Cedarwood (*) - Odor intensity 4, volatility 97. I found this one repulsive to use as a fragrance. But it works well as a mildew and moth repellent. Camphor (*) - Odor intensity of 5, vol atility ? Medicinal smell. Peppermint (*) - odor intensity of 7, volatility 70. A nice one for everyday use for healing and fragrance. Cajeput (*) - exotic, similar to camphor with a hint of spice. Pettigrain (*) - smells like grassy weeds. Several forms are available, the most common one being derived from citrus leaves a nd twigs. By itself it is unpleasant. Pennyroyal (*) - of the mint family, but smells like something one would use on furniture. Harmful to pregnant women if not used with precautions, it has a re putation for being an unpredictable abortefacient. Odor intensity of 7, vol atility of 86. Bay (*) - very sensual, mellow, slightly spic y. A favorite in men's perfumes, it blends well with all classes of fragrance, (women like to wear it too). Of ten used in Xmas candles, though probably in a synthetic form as th e essential oil seems much nicer. Class 3: Stimulating Intellectually This category of aromas contains mostly the s eeds, woods, woody fibers such as roots, stems, and stalks that release dry, spicy, and bitter odors. Some aromas from class 2 (Physically Stimulating) fit here also. For example, eucal yptus has many va rieties, as do the cedars and spruce; some are more mellow than others, and so me have more of a \"bite\". The best way to decide on the use of an aroma is how it actually affects the on e who is going to use it, both by itself and in any blends."},{"pageNumber":1058,"pageContent":"Some materials in this category are also noted for being rich and warm, with a fragrance that seems to mellow as it lingers. Vanill a and Cinnamon are two good examples. The fragrance materials in this class have been prized for their use in preserving foods, disguising flavors or enhancing them, and for their intense stimulation when ingested. They have also found use in the rites of embalming a nd the preparations of burial places as well as gifts interred with the dead. (The aspect of gifts for the dead is also true in the ancient uses of the other classes of aromas.) It is difficult to work with some of these oils and those of the phys ically stimulating group that are very intense, as they overpower easily. When a person becomes accustomed to working with them, it seems one builds up so me endurance. If working ceases or is interrupted for a few weeks, upon encountering th e aromas again there may be a very rapid, intense reaction that may or may not subside ju st as quickly. To avoi d that, ease into any exposure to the oils if not working with them daily. The herbs used in the smudge sticks of the Sout hwest American Indians a ppear to be of this third class. When any of the classes are burned as incense, the effect is often of this third class, as there is a change due to the burni ng process. Prior to burning, the sweet grass and sage seem to fit in class 1 and 2 respectively. Aromas in this category are: Nutmeg (*) - lighter oil beautiful in fl oral blends or with class 4 Cinnamon (*) - the essential oil is available as we ll as a synthetic (*S) form called Cinnamon Fragrance. Both are nice, but th ere is a noticeable difference. Allspice (*) - much stronger and drier / piercing than either nutmeg or cinnamon, which are fairly mellow by comparison. Clove Bud (*) - just a whiff, and one's head takes notice if the least bit fatigued. This oil is often found as clove oil as an em ergency treatment for toothache, for it is a topical anesthetic (numbs the area where applied, as it is rapi dly absorbed by the circulatory system). Ginger (*) - a number of forms exist. The commo n spice is somewhere between nutmeg and cinnamon in pungency, with a dry / piercing quality similar to allspice. Wild Ginger (*) - Canada Snakeroot. This is an endangered species in Wisconsin, but wildcrafting provides the source and it is gathered in Canada. It is similar in initial aroma and taste to ginger, but has an effect on the body th at is both stimulating and euphoric. Used in colognes. Anise (*) - already covered in the Relaxing-Sedative group. Fennel (-) - similar to anise in aroma, a valuable medicinal for digestive disorders, and as an accompaniment to heavy, spicy meals. The oil is extracted from the seeds when crushed a bit. The seeds are effectively used whole, and just a few crushed at a time. They make a short lived but nice incense burned on coals. The pl ant itself is nice as a cooked vegetable when under 12 inches, and as such has the same qualities as the oil."},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"Class 4: Euphoric - Sexual - Emotional This category of aromas is similar to Jellinek 's Class 1, which he called \"Sex Stimulating\". The non magickal literature deals with this class in an awkward manner at best. The descriptions given of the material s used in this class are: blun t, alkaline, may have an earthy smell, almost reminding one of something sligh tly spoiled. There may be fatty, oily, or waxy overtones, or a mustiness. These are of animal origin. However having worked with fragrance materials in personal and magickal use since 1979 , I think this is too narrow a description. Up until the last decade or so, the synthetic s ubstitutes for fragrance materials derived from animals were not satisfactory. Though the aroma of synthetics was close, even identical, the synthetics did not seem to have the \"staying\" power of the natural ar omas. With the growing responsibility toward wildlife management, endangered species are less available for indiscriminate slaughter simply for their glands . Recent introductions of synthetics seem to work well however, and are most often the ingr edients even in expensive perfume products. The value of this category in perfumes lies in the immensely pleasing fragrances, which for the animals are used in attracting mates. The response in human s is such that these aromas in minute amounts also act as attractants, er otic stimulants, and if knowledgeably used, facilitators of ecstatic states fo r sex magic, or singular efforts at transcendance of the physical plane whether of a sexual or non sexual method. In practical use, the \"staying power\" is referred to also as the base note, as it lingers the longest after the other oils have dissipated. The base oil however prevents the additional oils from evaporating as fast as they normally might . Depending on the oil, th e base can contribute a \"dark\" quality to the perfume. The aromas of this class are difficult to us e alone, even in minute amounts, due to their overpowering nature. With these scents there is quite a difference in the effect when they are diluted in essential oils of the other classes. Some examples are given in the recipe section, but a case in point is Patchouli, a very dark essence associated with Saturn. I have found it totally overpowers a perfume unless used in a ratio of 1 part pa tchouli (or less) to 10 parts of other oils. The reader is referred to any good resource on Ta ntra. Books on sexual magic also have a few usable ideas. But generally one has to give th is matter thought to avoid having the aroma take over the setting. Basically the fragrances when used properly are suggestive of warm body scents. In addition to use in religious rites and sex magic, some of th ese aromas have also found their way into medicine. Myrrh with goldenseal root ha s been a famous formula with antibiotic-like action. It is sold in capsule form for this purpose, and I can attest to its e ffectiveness on adults. The traditional literature lists only the animal source aromas in this category, but they were always used in combination with aromas from the Relaxing - Sedative class when diluted for personal use. The aromas chosen have been sandalwood, frankincense, myrrh, and some of the coniferous resins. A few seeds such as vani lla pods (fermented in the form we know them) and ambretta seed have also been used often en ough to warrant consideri ng them in this class. I would also add Canada Snakeroot or Wild Gi nger which, when it is aged in a mixture for a while, imparts a really exquisite note. It is fo r this reason that these aromas are included in"},{"pageNumber":1060,"pageContent":"this class, as their effects when combined and depending on the person, even when used alone, often have the effect of pr oducing the aroused euphoric state. When using these oils for a specific rite however , it is wise to consider what the effects might be, by wearing it over a period of da ys or weeks before the rite. It has been amazing to me to see that reactions to the same fragrance vary throughout the month. (Furth er research is being done to see if this correlates with the phases and signs of the moon.) By reactions I mean not only my own, but those of others around me who notice the fragrance I am wearing. Of course, this may also be rela ted to the changes in human phe romones that occur throughout the female's monthly cycle. Perhaps they enhance or alter the aromatic material. When purchasing aromas in this class, one can al so use the actual plant material, as it is so strong. However, be aware that there are at times wide variations in the quality of the plant material, due to growing and handling conditions, and in the past few years even the political climate. Aromas in this class are the following: Musk (*S) - a synthetic formula widely used. Ambergris (*S) - a synthetic Patchouli (*) - these 3 have been discussed a bit already. Frankincense (*) - a resinous aroma that is overwhelming in even small amounts. Myrrh (*) - this resinous aroma is detracting for fragrance, but combines beautifully with other classes. Canada Snakeroot (*) - Wild Ginger - the plant material. Vanilla bean (*) - considered a love attr actant, it has been used in cooking initially for that purpose. Rose (*) - from the damask rose. Promotes fantasy conducive to Venusian matters as well as its Relaxing - Sedative effects. Sweet Birch (*) - seldom used alone because its arom a is so d istinct. Useful in formulas relating to love and sexual attraction . Bitter Almond oil (-) - used both as a base oil for massage and anointing oils, and as a fragrance itself to induce love and harmony. Calamus (-) - Sweet Flag, highly prized in perfumes as a base also. Orris (-) - a form of iris. Many pe ople are allergic to this very sweet, cloying fragrance. Cardamon oil (-) - valued in baking also. Consider ed to be very magnetic when used for sexual attraction."},{"pageNumber":1061,"pageContent":"Part II - Recipes for Use in Lesser Black Magic Perfumes (for adding to the basi c lubricant recipe, or for pers onal wear as is): A few basic concepts need to be understood before mixing a perf ume, either to wear directly or to then add to an oil, for example the lubricant recipe near the end of this section. Th is basic recipe can be used for a number of things, just by adding different oils. Fixative : This is the base aromatic oil. It is an oi l with a very low evapor ation rate that retards the evaporation of all other aromatic oils added to it. It is important to know the characteristics of this oil, as it may either dominate or simply enhance without changing the oils added to it. More than one fixative oil may be used. In that case, one may be the stronger, so it is important to check the final product every day or so for a week. In some cases the aroma may make a decided change. This is especially noted in blends that include Patchouli. Volatility ratings of 70 or above indicate oils su itable for fixatives. In each of the original recipes that follow, at least one of the oils is a fixative. Af ter you have made a few of these recipes, try some of your own. Bottles : The bottles of oils used for the most part for this article are the 1/2 ounce amber, available from Frontier and most outlets that deal in aromatic materials. The oils are purchased in this size bottle, but empty ones are also available. You will find an assortment of 1/4 oz and 1/2 dram size bottles useful. Many of the recipes are geared to the 1/4 oz. The 1/2 dram holds about 30 drops of oil. The 1/4 oz bottle holds about 2 1/2 of the 1/2 drams. If bottles are being reused after having held a nother aromatic substance, rinse them well with 70% rubbing alcohol first. Never use pl astic, as the oils will melt them. The dropper referred to is the one that fits this bottle. Both are frequently available at well stocked pharmacies, but will have to be specia lly requested. If droppers are not available, plain plastic cocktail straws work fine. They seem to tolerate the oils well. Insert the straw into the oil 1/4 inch, place your index finger ove r the top of the straw to create a vacuum, and while keeping your finger in place remove the st raw to the empty bottle, releasing your index finger to drop the oil out of the straw. (Ma ny people do not know how to do this as I've learned from the work shops I've given.) This little trick will allow you to have individual straws. If you wish to use a straw or dropper for more th an one oil, swish it in a small bottle of 70% rubbing alcohol so as not to contaminate the othe r oils. Some oils do not rinse well, such as eucalyptus, frankincense, sandalwood, and the co nifers. A straw instead of a dropper can save you some grief. The best bottles to put small trial mixes in, or for tucking into a pocket or purse, are the half dram size. Request that they have caps resistant to oils unless sold for that purpose. They are also available from Frontier and other outlets. The amber bottles, and these tiny ones, usually do not cost more than 45 cents each (i n 1990). The glass tip droppers run 45 cents. The recipes here are given in \"tiny batch\" meas urements, as most people want to experiment with small quantities first. Considering the cost of some of the oils, th at is wise. The thicker"},{"pageNumber":1062,"pageContent":"oils like sandalwood and patchouli are maddening to work with, as they don't drop neatly into the tiny 1/2 dram bottles. Take careful aim, a nd have an absorbent material underneath, such as the squares of cotton that can be then used in closets or drawers so as not to waste the spilled fragrance. Cautions : Store all essential oils out of reach of children or persons not responsible for their actions. The oils marked with an asterisk (* ) in this article are all GRAS (generally recognized as safe for internal and external us e), when used in conjunction with a reliable source of information, with the exception of the following : Sweet Birch, Calamus, Cedarwood, Pennyroyal, Thuja Cedar, and Vetiver. If used to scent the lu bricant recipe, make sure that all of the ingredients are from th e (*) group, not the (*S) group. Substitutions can be made of similar oils. The following formulas have been developed over 11 years. They are offered for personal use for members of the Temple of Set. The names and the recipes are copyrighted, and may not be produced for sale or trade. Class 1 fragrances: 1. \"Sandala\" also has class 4 properties, and is suitable for both. It is a light fragrance. A cheaper version is made with musk instead of sandalwood. 40 drops of Sandalwood 8 drops of Rose 2. \"Lavender Rose\" - This is a fragrance that was very popular in the Victorian era, and still is one of the most requested. This is my version. Some also put oak moss with it, but I found as a potpourri it was one that many fo lk were sensitive to, so I prefer to just use the oil blend. 20 drops of Lavender 20 drops of Ylang-Ylang 10 drops of Cinnamon 10 drops of Sandalwood (or musk) This is a heavier fragrance than \"Sandala\". Both can be used succe ssfully in setting the atmosphere for intimate or social settings. Begin with \"Sandala\", and introduce \"Lavender Rose\" as the next level of intensity. Expect the guests to become mellow or perhaps even tired. These fragrances will not liven up the evening or atmosphere. 3. Confusion scents - By itself this almost has possibilities. But used to upset an atmosphere or person that has been heavily exposed to the formulas above, this does not bring on rave reviews. It is best used on something woode n, or a dried plant arrangement with some woody items. For this to work it must remain in the same environment as the other oils used. Don't be surprised if the \"intended\" becomes irritabl e or complains of a headache. It is very stimulating. 3a. \"Bad\" 40 drops bay 7 drops of pettigrain"},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"Class 2 and 3 fragrances: Here Musk is the fixative but is only subtly apparent. 1. \"Citryn\" - This fragrance is us able almost immediately. It is light, and though not lively is not so sedating as the above ones. 20 drops citronella 40 drops sweet orange 12 drops ylang-ylang 20 drops musk 2. \"Citrus Delight\" - add 10 drops cinnamon to the above recipe. Class 4 Fragrances: 1. \"Persian\" - A fragrance su itable for men or women. 1 dropper of sandalwood (20 drops) 1 dropper of musk (20 drops) 4 drops patchouli 3 drops ambergris Be sure to rinse the dropper in alcohol after e ach oil, or use separate straws. After blending, let it sit for a few days. Use 1 dropper for a fr agrant, sensual bath. Use one half, to one dropper, to 4 oz. of oil for massage, or to 1/2 cup of the lubricant recipe. If the oil will be used to supply fragrance for the lubricant, and if it may come into contact with someone's mouth, substitute another dropper of sandalwood for the musk, and use cinnamon instead of ambergris. It is not the same, but the differen ce is pleasing. It will compliment \"Persian\" if the latter is worn as perfume. This makes a nice base to which one can add othe r oils for very different effects. Rose, Ylang- Ylang, or Lavender can be added (5 to 10 drops for the Rose or Ylang-Ylang, and 3 to 5 for the Lavender). 2. \"Sexem\" - A sweeter, mellower fragrance than \"P ersian\", can be used preliminary to it over a long evening. Suitable for both men and women. A nice way to use it is for one partner to wear \"Persian\" and the other \"Sexem\". Either of these are also nice on the hair. Use a 1/4 oz bottle for this one. 4 droppers of sandalwood 8 drops of patchouli 5 drops of myrrh 3/8 inch to 1/2 inch of Va nilla bean snipped fine. Let this sit for about a week, and shake gently every day. Little tiny black dots will come off the vanilla bean and float in the oil, but this is normal. Used this way the vanilla is subtle, not at all overpowering as one might think. 3. \"Silk\" - A romantic blend of classes 1, 3 and 4."},{"pageNumber":1064,"pageContent":"20 drops of musk 8 drops of ylang-ylang 5 drops nutmeg or cinnamon This one can be used immediately. A richer version is made by substituting sandalwood for the musk, or using half of each. Other Applications: Lubricant (for extend ed sexual contact): This recipe is adapted from the book ESO , page 26. It is delightfully luxuriant. When stored, it has the color of skim milk, a nd the consistency of soft butte r. As soon as it touches warm flesh it melts into a fragrant, comfortably slippery lubricant. It is suit able for massage on all areas of the body. It is not objectionable to tast e either when one moves from manual to oral stimulation. (It makes a nice lip balm for those of us without partners.) If flavoring is desired, be sure to use essential oils that are GRAS (g enerally recognized as safe), as even minute amounts of non-GRAS oils could cause serious problems to mucous membranes, genital areas, or skin. The easiest way to make this is to purchase a set of stainless steel measuring cups, with the 2 cup size the largest. The ingred ients are not easily cleaned ou t of regular cookware. So you might want to reserve the measuring cups just for this project. The end result is well worth it. I've also enjoyed using small crocks, such as bean pots that hold about 1 cup of liquid. The oils that work the nicest are the spices. The book suggests o il of cloves for its warming effect. The same is experienced with oils of cinnamon and allspice. If you are uncertain, try cinnamon first, as it is the most gentle of the spices, cloves and allspice being quite a bit more intense. A favorite old time stimulant for wome n has been ground ginger applied directly to the area of interest (or so I r ead in a book somewhere). Ginger oil is similar to cinnamon in intensity. Other safe oils for flavoring su ch as vanilla and fruits do no t add a ny stimulating qualities, although the smell of natural vanilla and the eatin g of it are said to be traditional Tahitian aphrodisiacs. Vanilla flavored sugar cookies we re once considered a perfect treat to induce someone to 'fall in love' with the baker. Vanill a fits both in class 1 and 4 the relaxing and the euphoric. Lubricant Recipe: 20 tablespoons of mineral oil or canola oil 4 tablespons melted paraffin or a very clean bees wax. 2 tablespoons melted petrolatum. Puritan brand cooking oil is satisfactory - anythi ng else leaves an oily taste. If using the canola oil and you find it has a taste, then use the mineral oil. However, once mixed with the other ingredients and mingled with the nor mal secretions of the body, it should not be noticeable."},{"pageNumber":1065,"pageContent":"I've not found a suitable subs titute for the petrolatum. (Petrolatum is just plain white petroleum jelly, otherwise known by the brand name Vaseline). There is a new vegetable source baby jelly available from Frontier Coopera tive Herbs, but I have not had a chance to try it. Bring an inch of water to boil in a shallow sa ucepan, such as for poaching eggs. Using a 1 cup measuring cup, melt some paraffin or wax shav ings. When melted, remove the cup and put a 2 cup measure into the water. Pour the 4 tabl espoons of melted wax into the 2 cup measure. (Use a metal spoon and heat it briefly in the boiling water before scooping the melted wax.) Using the same spoon, while it is still warm, s poon out 2 tablespoons of the petrolatum and add it to the melted wax in the 2 cup measure. Next add the 20 tablespoons of the oil. Stir well with a tongue depressor or small spoon. Remove from the heat as soon as it is mixed, and while cooling add the essential oil, 2 to 3 drops is enough. (You ma y add more once you are familiar with the results.) This mixture stores nicely in li ttle jars purchased at discount stores in the beauty supplies dept. Add the aroma oils after th e mixture is in the jars, and th en you can try several different ones. A little of this lubri cant goes a long way unless used for a general body massage. Part III: Aromatic Substances as a Lesser Black Magic Modality A. Basic Fragrance Catego ries and Effects on Humans The following fragrance classes (also introduced at the beginning of this article) have proven useful in organizing the data on a wide variety of fragrances. For the most part this paper deals with natural aromas. Again, When the text below refers to a class it means the order in which they are given here, not the Jellinek class. 1. relaxing - sedative (narco tic) - Jellinek class 2 2. refreshing - physically (v iolent) - Jellinek class 3 3. stimulating - mental alertness - Jellinek class 4 4. euphoria - sexual / spiritu al - Jellinek class 1 B. General Suggestions for Manipulating Environments 1. A social gathering with you in control - avo id discussing or call ing attention to the aromas. Use class 1 and 2 aromas around the room. Begin with light, barely noticeable exposure. So meone may have a very sensitive nose or an allergy. Wait to see before you attempt any more. Then as they settle down, increase the expos ure (introduce a conversat ion piece with more of the same fragrance). Have a small gift for each person attending, eg: a name tag with more of the fragrance on it. If one or more persons are to be singled out for special concern, just give the items to them, or arrange the seating so they are closest to th e heaviest concentrati on of the fragrance."},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"Use a class 3 or 4 aroma on your person, where y ou can inhale surreptitiously when you begin to feel the effects of the 1 a nd 2 on yourself. Make sure you use a compatible aroma from 3 or 4, so as not to cause yourself a headache or to become irritable from confusing scents. Sipping some tea or fruit juice heavy with spice will do the same. Plan a way to drink it without the others knowing. It may cause perspiration and dry m outh, so just take a few sips at a time if it is strong. Serving refreshments that are fruity and sweet can compliment the the class 1 and 2 aromas. Herb recipe books have ideas for using flower pe tals in desserts and salads, or for garnishes. Some petals, like the pretty lave nder comfrey blossom, have so much nectar they can be eaten right from the flower without adding anything. 2. Social gathering for hostile purposes (eg: on e or more guests to be singled out without anyone knowing): Use a confusion scent on the targ et person, and make sure the re st can get plenty of exposure to the person. eg: Give the person something as a compliment to wear, hold, open or keep close by, and have the confusion scent on the obj ect. It isn't immediately noticeable, but after awhile will be, especially to the target person. If the person is assertive, she/he may try to tactfully say something. Move the item away th en with all due inno cent apologies; keep it within 6 to 8 feet but out of direct vision. Im mediately distract the individual with some question they have to think about to answer. The aroma has done its job and will continue to do so. To protect yourself or the others in the area who are not targete d, find a way to get a class 2 or 3 scent to each of them. Spraying the furnitu re they will be sitting on is one way. (See the recipe section for ideas.) Several ideas from the previous section are also usable here. Make sure the target person gets the \"gift\" to take home. 3. Unwelcome visitors Use a strong scent as a bac kground near the front entrance of the house. Use another one within about 10 feet as the pe rson turns a corner. Then set so mething close by that has yet another strong smell that is initia lly pleasant, but as the others waft in will be too much. You bustle about serving the guests a nd sneaking fresh air. The scents used can be made up ahead, and kept in glass atomizers near where neede d, and sprayed as you make your way to answer the door. Good ones to use are Citronella at the door, which can be excused as an insect repellent (it is), and you are just keeping the pests away. A sec ond fragrance could be eucalyptus \"Oh I had a bit of a stuffy head, and it helps.\" (It does, and have tissues handy). Th e third fragrance could be a lavender impregnated item, such as a ba sket (kept in a tight Xmas tin, and kept handy just for this purpose). If you work in an office area and have trouble some visitors who like to take up your time, some of these ideas may help. Just remember th at once they leave, you have to clear the air quickly. Hot air will do that. Any moving air will also do that."},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"Fabrics including your clothes will collect the aromas. Lightly spraying the air with rubbing alcohol seems to be the best. Just be careful of the surfaces it lands on. I've not had any trouble with carpeting and the nor mal drape fabrics, though I have n't used it on antique satin. It appears that most sofa materials also tolerate the light spray, both of the fragrances and of the plain alcohol. To wreak some particularly vile havoc on someone who has caused you problems, a sprinkle of asafoetida powder will do wonders to disgust. Th is is easily distributed inside a cluttered desk drawer. Avoid conspicuous actions like pu tting it where the person' s clothes will pick up a visible trace. If there is a floor covering under the desk, sprink le some there and brush it in so it settles into the fibers. On a smooth su rface floor, sprinkle it carefully around edges of the room using an envelope with a corner cu t out for accuracy. Even good housekeepers don't do the corners of the room everyday. 4. Counteracting depression or negativity in an environment: Try to involve the target persons in an activ ity that uses the fragrance material, such as constructing wreaths or craft pr ojects and then applying the oils . It is important that they inhale the scent for 10 to 15 minutes , so it should be within 2 to 3 feet of them for best results. Quickest results are within several inches of the nose, but do not keep the source there constantly: waft it and stop after a few minut es. Present it in seve ral exposures over 30 minutes, rather than all at once. Augment with color and sound. Class 1 and 2 fragrances are good for this, but so me of the oils are es pecially th erapeutic. Refer to the descriptions to select appropriate ones. See the guidelin es below for additional ways to convey the aroma in a healing environment. 5. Intimate environments: It won't take much imagination to set these up with the ideas already presented. It is very important to know the tastes of the \"intended\". Use single aromas in your contacts with this person, one each time. Try to get a reaction with out being obvious. See the discussions of the oils to select appropriate ones. I will not comment on personal e xperience in this regard, as I reserve the right to a few secrets. C. Guidelines For Using Objects to Carry Aroma If the target persons are going to handle the ob jects, place the oil where it won't contact their skin. Avoid anything that some one may put into their mouth, unless you are willing to accept the consequences of inadvertent poisoning or bu rns to the mouth and face tissue. Plan your moves, and apply the oils 15 min to an hour befo re the expected company. It takes awhile for the oils to dissipate into the atmosphere, so that no one spot can be localized as the source. It is important to keep the room closed and not ventilated, and warmer rather than cool. If heavy odors are a problem, air the room out befo re you begin. Take into account anyone who may smoke or introduce other odors into the room (such as garlic breath). Someone's aftershave or perfume could also sabotage your be st efforts. If that is a possibility, plan how you might get them to circulate where their arom atic influence will be subdued or at least confusing to them. If that doesn't work, c ontribute a confusing s cent to their person."},{"pageNumber":1068,"pageContent":"Below I list some items that are easily used w ith oils. Use cheap pain t brushes or swabs to apply (cotton on toothpick, no plastic or synthetics). Wood - Use small items easily moved about: mi niatures work well, figurines, items for decorative use. If you are trying to be inconspi cuous, look for picture frames or wood trim on objects no one is likely to touch. Some oils will remove varnish or wood sealers (resinous oils like spruce). Other oils may enhance, like lemon or sweet orange. For best results, use unvarnished wood or apply where it won't matte r. Unfinished, thoroughly dry wood, such as that of baskets or small boxes, are nice to use, because the oil is absorbed and provides a protective coating as well as bei ng a subtle source of aroma. Floral arrangements - dried or ar tificial flowers. Sel ect areas such as the moss that the flowers are stuck into for subtle aroma. Spanish moss or excelsior (wood source) are perf ect. Don't use oils on styrofoam or plastic stem holders, or melting will occur. Place wreaths or sprays on walls around the room, and add the oils just before the gathering starts , applying it to the woody stems or straw base. Since people won't be close up to them, it will ta ke awhile to spread through the room, and will less likely be noticed. Avoid putting oils on silk flower petals or plastic flowers or plastic centers. Staining and melting may occur. Unfired ceramic - a potter or ceramist can easily make 2\" discs out of earthenware and fire them unglazed. Use one fragrance per disc. Use se veral drops of oil, and set out of direct vision as it will be too obvious. Cotton balls can be used in the same way. Tuck into inconspicuous places around the room or tape in place, and then add several drops of the oil. Porcelain circles or metal ones are available for on top of light bulbs. The oils are dropped in the groove or onto the unglazed surface. Fiber petal rings are used the same way, but the effect of these lasts only about 15 minutes. Cork or wood or pressed fiber found in craft shops can be made into coasters to give guests with their drinks. Watch the surfaces where the oi ls are applied, so that furniture isn't ruined. Apply the oils to the edge of the coasters we ll in advance of handling, so there won't be residue getting on guests skin a nd possibly causing reactions. Simmer potpourri in an electric pot: this only works fo r class 2 & 3 as all other fragrances dissipate too quickly to be effective for very long. Room freshener incense - Make sure the scent is the exact class you want. Many commercial ones are mixtures, and tend to confuse or mildly irritate the olfactory system, simply because they are mish mashes of fragrance material unwittingly blended by people unaware of the effect on subjects. The best way to use commercial incense is to ge t single fragrances that also exist as a single oil. They will be named by the derivative plant or animal material. An example is sandalwood incense. An example of one that is an unknown mixture would be a name like Egyptian Incense. Repeated use over a pe riod of time will give you a clue as to the class of such a mixture's reactions."},{"pageNumber":1069,"pageContent":"Pillar candles - scoop out a well around the wick about 1/2 in deep. Burn candles until the melted wax accumulates to fill about half of the well. Add several drops of oils to the melted wax. CAUTION: experiment carefully, as some of th e resinous oils are high ly flammable (such as frankincense). Also make sure you are using an oil that does not cont ain alcohol, or you may get a conflagration. Carpeting (drapes are not recommended unless you are sure the fabric won't stain) - For rugs and carpets use a mixture of 4 oz. rubbing alcohol to 1/2 tsp of oil, more or less, depending on the oil and effect you want. Use caution if hous e pets or family members spend time on the rug. Wall surfaces - Masonry such as used in baseme nts may be sprayed with the alcohol mixture containing lavender and eucalyptus. This is effective for mildew and vermin control. (Use peppermint for rodents.) These odors linger howev er, so your family (like mine) may protest if these oils are used in large areas. Do a small space at a time, leaving several days in between each application. Beach stones can be used, especially the mo re porous limestone, for placing around a hearth or near a wood burning stove. The above suggestions for designing an aromatic atmosphere are only a start. It is a good idea to get familiar with a few aromatic oils from each of the classes.

For their part, Receivers were to \"attempt to penetrate the fabric of 'space' itself in their efforts to penetrate the essential se nder.\" For my own part, as a Sender , I would try to divert \"energy and impulse s away from [my] au ra-like shield.\" In developing the experiment, it seemed to me th at this redistribution of tasks represented one of the missing links or smoking guns of the misaligned field of parapsychology. In MetaMind II , there would not be \"an actual, active transmission.\" With no specific targets, and no active transmis sion, how could we proceed in a largely goal- oriented Working? I felt the best possible answer was to focus our energies on the establishment of empathetic links themselves . Treating other impressions as an aside, we could note what happened dur ing the actual link(s). An added (2) element would be the lack of a specific transmission time, or reception time s . For the convenience of participants, the only conven tions would be that parameters would exist during which either transmission or reception s could take place. I desc ribed that element of the experiment like this: \"During the prescribed limit, a sender will transmit. Only the sender will determine the exact time he wishes to send. \" In addition to my role in the experiment, each receiver was to determine their best window for reception. The two processes - that of sending and receiving - did not have to coincide. The real issue and objective behind MM#2 wa s this: could the participants pursue and perform their respective functions vs. could they successfully se nd or receive specific targets. I likened our Charge to that of the Black Magi cian in general ... performing the Great Work without lusting for results. III. Experiment Outline MetaMind II would take place on April 22, XVIII A.S. The parameters during which transmission/reception might occur would be between 9:30 PM and 12:00 AM (EST). No object (ie: target) would be chosen ahead of time for transmission. I would act as the transmitter, though no specific transmission time would be provided. No prescribed duration, for transmission or reception, would be in place. The Council of Nine, as a body, would be inv ited to participate, as would Priestess Vandenbussche. Each potential participant woul d receive a package consisting of a covering letter, a revised data sheet (for recording their impressions), and a description of the experiment. As a final stipulation, I would not need to know who participated. Upon my receiving results, each participant would receive my results. At the preplanning stage, Magistra Sinclair, Priestess Geske, and Priestess Vandenbussche had indicated their willingness to participate. (3) "},{"pageNumber":1073,"pageContent":"IV. Participants and Their Preparations As it turned out, each individual taking part in MM#2 experienced distinct subsets of moodiness or other feelings immediately prior to the experiment, or days in advance. Priest Neilly reported: \"I had felt 'anxious' about the experiment for th e previous week. At 7:30 PM that night, I felt tired and drawn out.\" Priestess Geske stated that: \"For two days prior to the event and throughout the day of April 22, I felt notable periods of estrangement, aloofness, detachment, as though being preprepped for the experiment. Nausea and tension started about 9:00 PM.\" For Priestess Vandenbussche, her recepti on was heralded in this manner: \"I had an overwhelming sensation which was unmistakable. I knew it was time. I had felt a little anxious about the experiment earlier.\" Magistra Sinclair was: \"Annoyed because I couldn't find the mu sic I wanted. I finally found it.\" Having resolved the issue, Master Sinclair began her attempt around 11:30 PM (EST). She later stated that she had a \"feeling of being pr essed for time and that I should begin by 8:30 PM.\" [Please note that Ma gistra Sinclair's recep tion actually began after my transmission.] Her Working environment was highlighted by Irrlicht , the music she had chosen. Priestess Colleen Geske began her preparations by readying her Chamber around 12:30 AM; by which time I had completed my portion of th e experiment in its entirety. She readied her inner Chamber as well -- a technique which, she later reported, creates a positive medium for communication. After Compression, she was dr awn into dancing around the Chamber. Following that, she sat \"cross-legged on the couch before the east wall of the Chamber.\" The posture assumed allowed her to remain ope n to communication, and was one which brought forth an altered state. She was to 'awaken' again at around 1:00 AM, to begin her reception. Priestess Suzie Vandenbussche, for her part, began her preparations by taking a hot bath. Following that, a brief rest period ensued. Sh e moved to a spot on the floor and began by listening to music, but that \"the sensati ons were too strong to try to do this.\" My own preparations covered four stages: 1. Early during the week of the experiment , I began by supplementing my exercise routine by emphasizing more j ogging, for longer durations. 2. The night of MM#2, I dined on peanut butter, honey, and Coca-Cola. (4) 3. I assembled the necessary items I'd need to conduct my portion of the experiment. These included jogging apparel, a tape reco rder, my large Pentagram of Set medallion, my Scorpion ring, Anubis oil and other sundry items. [My participation was to take place outside of the apartment.]"},{"pageNumber":1074,"pageContent":"4. At around 9:05 PM, I left our apartment and drove to Ashbridges Bay; a park and boardwalk abutting Lake Ontario in Toront o. After parking, I changed into my jogging gear and began final Compression. Until 9:55 PM, I listened to music in the car. At five of ten, I arrived at my Working area -- the boardwalk. V. Experiment Results Since it's important that some of what I di d and experienced before and during transmission be included; I've done so here. The results (wha t was received by the ot her participants) will be presented following my own description, and we re assigned a basic rating by me of Direct Hit (DH), Indirect Hit (IH), Other (O), or Not Applicable (NA). A. Priest Robertt Neilly – Transmitter To reach an appropriate state of mind conduciv e to transmitting my impressions, I had earlier decided that I would jog back and forth along the 3K length of the boardwalk. I felt I would know when the right time had arrived. (5) For the results of the experiment to make sense, it's worth my while to tell the reader what I encountered dur ing my run. As I made my way (initially, in an easterly directio n), I came across the following items in order of appearance: An Olympic-sized swimming pool; a second play ground; a builder's fence, made of redwood- coloured slats of wood and wire; various piers an d breakers along the waters edge (initially, to my right); two snack facilities; various apartment buildings and ot her dwellings to the left of me (north side of the boardwalk and beach); tennis courts; a small lighthouse; and at the easterly limit of the boardwalk, a rowing club. Dotted along the wa ter's edge were groups of people holding flashlights. During my run, I came across three other jogg ers and various other people out for strolls. While the above describes the things I saw, heard, or encountered, there were also the thoughts I was reinforcing as I prepared for transmission. I reinforced certain themes, as I prepared for the Voice of the Neter. I thought about how we participants had to \"break the code\" of ESP. I concentrated on my 'power' ring (the scorpion). I felt that when the time arrived, the Voice effec tively had to pierce the void in order to be heard. Having run myself into a state of physical exhaustion (but ment al calmness, alertness, and readiness), I Sensed the time was right. [On th e way home, I used the cassette machine to record the following: \"At the ti me when legs were hurting, and I felt it was the appropriate time to allow reception/transmission, I went off the beaten path, which was the boardwalk; at that point I run for about an hour and covered about five miles and was fairly warm and was feeling a bit funny. I had been feeling funny fo r the past fifteen minutes. I ran off the boardwalk, through the sand and onto a cement sort of dock.\" About three minutes earlier, I ha d activated the power ring used for all special Workings. As I ran those last few yards, I turn ed the face of the ring palm-outwa rd and raised my left hand to the sky in a fist. I stood, slightly wavering, on the pier and salu ted the Prince of Darkness, Set. I called upon my Noble Sisters and Brothers all. For part of the time on the pier, my hands were raised in"},{"pageNumber":1075,"pageContent":"the air. At other times, I either lay down on my back, gazing at the night sky, or I sat and looked out over the lake. An interesting thing occurred during the first five minutes of the Working. From my transcript at the time, \"An interesting side-effect, or ma ybe it wasn't a side-effect, was when I called upon the one known as Colleen; at that precise mo ment, a shooting star shot across the sky.\" I continued to look at the sky, noticing various features. Almost directly above me was the Big Dipper. Further away, over the la ke, two stars that I likened to eyes. The moon was about 3/4 full. A nother star was evident as well, and this is how I described it during my transmission: \"Off to the left of them was a single star; One Star in Sight, as Crowley might have put it. It was th e star that drew most of my concentration.\" I fancied that One Star as one of those undefined goals, that , once Awakened by the Initiate, becomes alive. I decided that the One Star wa s a representation of myself, whose Neter was just beginning to bloom. Whenever I addressed a Sister or Brother, I tried to place matching emphasis on an aspect of that Setian. For Amn, I thought of myself as running with the Ram. When considering Priestess Vandenbussche, I gazed at the moon an d said aloud something to the effect that: \"You see Sister, that's the light I was telli ng you about all this time ... the vastness of open space and all the possibilities.\" I addressed Magistra Sinclair as one undead (6) to another. I spoke to her, telling her that we had stopped travelling in Time just long enough to BE conscious in the realm of manifestation. One distinct impression I had while transm itting kept recurring- it was the sound and feel of the waves as they crashed against the shore. I recorded this thought af terwards: \"They hit the beach, and they swished ... and there was a ringing. Every time they swished there was a ringing and the ringing was like a bird.\" Now here's something -- a separate, and distin ct part of the transmission included a 'mini' DR. (7) I performed this during the latter stag e of my transmission. This Working was a purpose within a purpose. It was directed at/to one of my coworkers, and was intended to influence a virus. To accomplish my purpos e, I Voiced my judgement and invoked the essence of his Examiner, \"to execute the judgement.\" Following that, I raised my left hand, stated the old adage that as was below, so was above, and concluded with the traditional closing. I subsequently lowered my hand to indicate that the judgement was underway. This, then, virtually concluded my transmission. After saluting Set once more, I left the pier and worked my way back to the parking lot. * * * * "},{"pageNumber":1076,"pageContent":" B.

An abundance of impressions occurred on the intu itive level; on matters of E ssence, Being, and Initiate. Direct hits can be assigned w ith reasonable certainty accordi ng to their degree of intensity. For example, Magistra Sinclair saw me \"standing in a desolate waste land, or desert\", when in fact I was standing on a pier, out from the beach and overlooking Lake Ontario. Indirect hits are those which are less intense, less accurate or act as an aside to th e main Working itself. Sometimes a hit which I tagged as Indirect was merely out of synchronization with an event. Hits I attributed as \"Other\" may not have a pplied to the Working itself, but nevertheless"},{"pageNumber":1079,"pageContent":"applied to the Initiates or their inter-relations hips. Impressions I felt were \"Not Applicable\" were deemed so only because I couldn't rela te them to the Work ing, or to the inter- relationships of the Initiates. Disregarding assignments of impressions to the ar bitrary labels of \"Direc t Hit\", \"Indirect Hit\", \"Other\", or \"Not Applicable\", what was accomplished during the Working? As closely as I can identify it, it was empat hy. Initiates were able to experience the feelings, sensations, exaltations of other Initiate s. Targets aside, this was the crux. After this experiment, I knew that certain faculties known in comm on parlance as extra sensory in nature were 'only' extensions of our normal/natural sensory organs. In this respect, a clairvoyant possesses extrao rdinary eyesight. S/he would see more, and more clearly, than others. A telepath would be someone whose h earing was enhanced to a remarkable degree. And the empaths ... we are they. The Working (re)established our paranormal abil ities. It gives us, I believe, impetus to become the new-breed psychics. If we can but grasp the sometimes elusive nature of ESC-for example, spontaneous instances last ever so briefly - then we can promote those same abilities. Part of the very successful efforts wh ich most people have used on themselves to convince themselves that ESP\\ESC is not possible, can be undone. As Initiates in a Temple full of wonders, of tangible results obtained through Workings, we are more than capable of this task. My sincere appreciation is extended to Magi stra Sinclair, Priest ess Vandenbussche, and Priestess Geske. I also take this opportunity to thank High Pr iest Aquino, whose support also factors in as being important. Footnotes 1.

I Thor hold the Hammer of the North, and also Groud the Hammer of Hell. In the Northern Cosmic Universe, the sky was made from the sk ull of a felled giant, therefore defining a limit or end of the U(u)niverse.

I Thor, the giants' bane, swing my Hammer, and strike this crack with the force of Ur, the primal fire, and with the power of Sow ilo, with every bit of strength and power, I strike , and watch this crack as it crumbles to dust at my feet.

Also, the words prin ted here are those words actually spoken by Shuti during the ritual, without reference to th e prepared script, and they therefore differ somewhat from the script originally prepare d. That prepared script is included as an appendix for those who may be interested. 2. The text presented here was designed and spoken by Adept William Farnsler. 3. The words printed here were spoken by Adept Gary Gonzalez. 4. Like the two statements above it, the texts of the working were not planned in advance by Shuti. They were created on the day of the working by each participant. 5. Personal note: I enjoy long hair, on others a nd on myself. I enjoy the feel of my own waist-length hair on my back. For a variety of reasons, I cut my hair short in late XVIII. Much of the shorn hair, in strands over a f oot long, are kept for the specific purpose of using them in meaningful symbo lic sacrifices like this one. 6. Here Adept Gonzalez began forming an egg, showing us the egg's surface by moving his hands around it. 7. Again, the words printed here are those of Adept Farnsler. Working: Creation Purpose: To facilitate future work aimed at the creation of a new objective Universe, one which is more suitable and supportive of Life, Intelligence, Awareness, Will, and Magick.

Once su re that the green candle is lit, this initiate extinguishes that previously lit candle.] [A second initiate now lights the red candle from the flame of the green candle.

To this universe came an agele ss intelligence, a will ful intelligence that unbalanced the universe, an intelligence that fought for freedom from this combination of predestined order and chaos. This intelligence then brought forth HarWer, in a creation which cancelled the universal imbalance, leaving a Void in which true Creation could take form ... as Set. Set, that Great and Noble Being, the Highest of Life. Set brought forth Shu and Tefnut, Opposites in Balance, dynamic Opposition, and th e forces of creation. These two begat Geb and Nut, Earth and Sky, the physically present an d the distantly perceived, the solid and the ethereal. These two then created in turn all Neters, Principles, Forms, and Gods.

Even though I had done some Work previously with the Teutonic concept of time, it was these initial suppositions which would lead me to compose the above Work (both on a mental and physical level) during the month that followed my synchronous performance of Sir Ronald Barrett's Shub-Niggurath Working. The Working of G.B.M. above was designed to provide myself, and the members of the Black Phoenix Pylon who were in attendance, with a formula with which we might begin to explore and recapture the ancestral wisdom and power that was hidden deep within our beings. This was accomplished by establishing a subjective (or numinous) link between the individual participant and his/her ancestors via some family heirloom (r unic Othala), that was either inherited or given to the person in question by so me close (and now deceased) relative. In this way the participants were be able to, at le ast subjectively, connect themselves with their ancestors by utilizing the Wyrd that had been accrued by said object. The establishment of said relationship was then to act as a bridge between each individual and the regions of the self which contain those qualities wh ich are inherent to their folk. The objective of this Working was merely to esta blish said link so that the participants, over the course of time, might be able to recapture the wisdom and power that is their birthright. I might also add that this particular Working, when completed, proved to be somewhat unorthodox, in that it lacked a few of the elements one usually sees in Setian Work. I feel that this particular deviation enhanced rather th an detracted from the Work, and presented all those present with a new and different type of cha llenge (magically). The flavor of this rite is Teutonic, but the magical formula is universal. I would be interested in receiving the feedback of those Knights and Dames who choose to perfor m this Working, especially in circumstances which are unique to their pa rticular ancestral background. I would also like to thank Sir Setnakt for his su ggestions which helped to add more of a sense of masculine/feminine balance to the rite, a nd for the list of exercises he included to supplement the Work. Commentary Sir Setnakt (Don Webb, III°) Although the Order of the Trapezoid has develo ped a spiritual technology from Germanic approaches to the question of ancestry as a component of the individual, it should be remembered that the ancient Egyptians were in terested in this ques tion as well. In the Tale of the Two Brothers , which Te Velde identifies as probably th e only Setian text to have survived from Khem, ancestry figures very strongly. Wh en Bata (Set) knows that his enemies are coming to kill him, he hides his spiritual ancestry -- his heq in the form of a seed -- in the top of a pine tree. After his death, his brother Anpu searches for the heq for seven years, and then by placing it in water (nourishing it), Bata grows back from th e seed and begins his revenge against his enemies. So the concept of Re manifestation was tied with the notion of Spiritual"},{"pageNumber":1101,"pageContent":"Heritage for the Setians of the XIX and XX dynasti es, and may have special meaning for the Children of Set today. Both discovering and crea ting spiritual heritage are operant aspects of the Eighth Angle of the Seal of Runa. These are some comments on ancestral magic which might be of interest to those planning to adapt this Working to their personal Xeper. Some of these will be suggestions for meditations which might be done before the Work or afterwar d, either singly or as group exercises as each of you will. Obviously you won't have time to do all this; these are merely to suggest possibilities. I do recommend trying numbers Four and Seven though. I. Take the heirloom, and imagine whatever th e person who gave it to you did with it. If it's your grandfather's watch, just imagine him looki ng at the time. Then imagine him putting it away and then looking at an heirloom that tied him to the past (a real object if you know about it, or an imaginary one) try to imagine what that ancestor looked like and did. Just relax and let whatever pictures come. Try and be as ope n and uncensoring as possible. Later, try to write down your impressions of these people. How are they like you? How would you like to be like them? II. Think about the first time you had any ma gical thoughts. Whether it was an imaginary playmate, or a ghost you thought you saw, or what ever. How did your family experience lead you directly to this? This is a way of opening your mind to the idea that your family life, rather than being something you escaped from, wa s in fact training for your Initiatory life. This doesn't mean you have to love and accept your family; we don't have to love bootcamp, but we need to make ourselves open to the lesso ns that painful memories may be hiding from our selves. III. Remember that ancestral doors open very slowly, so you must resolve to accept what wells up from the unconscious. This is sometim es very hard to do -- as Setians, learning submission is very rough, and yet one of the ways the Nine Gates of Hel are opened is through submission. As a sign of this pact with y our ancestors, treat the next thing someone in your family asks you to do as a communication from your Higher Self. As an example of this willing projection, let's say your Mom asks you to come fix her car. Before you go, invoke your Higher Self to look for the Mysteries invol ved. Enter the experience with your senses as wide open as they can be. Try to remember everyt hing that is said to yo u. Try not to argue. In short, treat the whole affair as a Working. The idea is to open yourself to the spiritual reality of your family which has been obscured by years of bullshit. When you have finished the task, invoke your ancestors and remind them that you now stand in Troth with them; ask them to begin to re veal to you the Mysteries held by your family. Again this is more \"passive\" than most Setian magic. Don't worry about quick results -- after all, it took your ancestors millions of year s to produce you -- and as you Xeper -- as you Become an immortal, potent, and powerful essence -- you will spend millions of years shaping the Earth in her unspeakable variety. IV. Make a list (mental or written) about thi ngs you like and don't like about your parents. Try to reduce the qualities to one word like Greed or Faithfulnes s. How many of these adjectives apply to you (honestly now)? How many apply to your grandparents? If the same word seems to appear on all three lists, how can this quality (whether good or bad) be used to further your Xeper?"},{"pageNumber":1102,"pageContent":"V. Make a mental list of all the historical th ings that had to happen for you to come into being. Begin with stuff like your Mom mee ting your Dad, and go backward. For example some of my ancestors ca me to this country because it rain ed a lot in Irel and in 1848 and 49. I know from their name Blackwell, that they had to have gone to Ireland with Cromwell -- so I know that the Puritan revolution is absolutely genetically essen tial for my sitting here typing out this article. Now that you've got an idea of the mighty forces behind you, think about it in two ways: (a) How much of what you are is due to for ces beyond you -- how does th is relate to your being Self-created? (b) What if you caused several of these events to come into being to begin your own Xeper -- if part of you exists so deep ly in time -- how can you use that part to steer the world's Becoming. VI. Pay attention to dreams that follow the Work (not necessarily that night, just sometime afterward). See if ancestors or ancestral themes show up. If you've got any skills in lucid dreaming, treat the ancestors in your dreams the same way you trea t the living family in item III above. VII. Put aside for the moment whether or not you're planning to have children in this life. Just assume that someone among your blood relatives will reproduce (even if you choose not to). Imagine some Spiritual descendant of yours. What would y ou like him or her to be like? What Willed characteristics would you like to pass on to them? Try for a moment to send them the kind of formative energy -- the kind of pattern-vitality (uruz) -- that you yourself would like to receive. Having sent this en ergy forth, expect to receive it fr om an ancestor -- this too is a way of keeping Troth. VIII. Recreate a family ritual with your Setian kin. Take something that's very pleasant and filled with good memories from your chil dhood, which now in the complicated life of adulthood is difficult -- say Christmas dinner, and recreate it with Seti ans with appropriate formulas. Instead of a prayer before supper, tr y a Setian version of the Meal stave on page 37 of Nine Doors to Midgard . Have the same foods, same smells, same colors. The idea is to recreate the forces of family in the newly willed kinship from our spiritual father, Set. In this particular exercise, don't worry or think too mu ch about the theology. Re-Creation makes a lot of use of body knowledge; strive to connect your blood heritage w ith your spiritual heritage. Don't do this to make fun but to have fun. IX. For the Setian, first, foremost, and always is Xeper. Any exercise or action should be evaluated in the Light of the Black Flame. For our ancestors' ancestors the Word Becoming was Weird. In our current language we have some what forgotten its original meaning. We use it to mean something odd or bi zarre (as in \"Wow, man that wa s weird!\"), but the original meaning referred to those events that reflected a divine pattern. For ex ample if one man kills another man with a sword nothing is very special, but if one man defending his family estate kills twenty men with a sword th at's Weird -- that's the pattern of a Hero -- something that exists inside us -- within the Hidden realm of Perfection -- but is seldom manifest -- Becoming manifest. Try when writing in your magical diary or wh en speaking among yourselves to use the word Weird only to refer to divine patterns Becomi ng manifest in human life. When speaking with"},{"pageNumber":1103,"pageContent":"those without, try not to use the word \"weird\" unless the happening is truly Weird. Don't try to explain to them why you sometimes use the wo rd and sometimes not -- this is a Hidden magical action of invoking the Weird of your life in their presence.

It will make you more awake, and it opens the st reams of ancestral Becoming to the conscious and selfwilled Becoming of the Setian.

I stood and wa tched the room fill with a warm orange glow, a good representation of my fiery temper. Next, in a raised voice, I read my invocation to Set, using the version from my Crystal Tablet . I felt every word, seemingly more so than ever before. This may have been partially due to my emotional state. I then turned back around to face the Alta r, listening to the wi nd sound effects in the beginning of the Call of Cthulhu (the piece of music I was using). I visualized a storm with great fury, as my Black Flame danced around to the furious mood and the furious music. Next, a few impromptu words were spoke n before I drank from my Grail. I began to read what I had written only 15 minutes before hand, shouting it most of the time, and yet trying to stay in control.

Commentary from Priest Mann and Discussion In a letter dated August 9, XXVII, Magister Mann made the following observations: \"Your Working for the fall of Christianity was powerful and heart-felt. I would simply ask one question ... concerning that aspect of the Working. \"The question is obvious, and draws on a remark made by John Fowles, author of The Magus : \"Mankind hungers for mysteries; remove them , and men will continue to read the old detective stories.\" I'm misquoting this slightly, I am sure, but the esse nce remains true -- if you remove Christianity, what will you repl ace it with? What will take its place? \"It was one thing to wish fervently for the demi se of the Soviet Empire; there were and still are things to take its place. But a major religion, with 20% of the world's population being believers; that demise is a horse of an entirely different aroma. Our sodality will never number more than a small percentage of any population group you care to study -- what would you leave for the rest of them? If Christ ianity dies, would it be replaced by Islam, a religious system and world-view that I cons ider even more pernicious and toxic than Christianity? That's called taking the long vi ew, and it is something you must begin to incorporate into your outlook as you seek to become Elect and therefore a person who changes the warp and woof of Set's and your world.\" In an August 26 letter to Priest Dennis Mann, Ad ept Parkin pointed out that the Working for the fall of Christianity was intended for the Briti sh Isles only, and not for the whole world. In the U.K. less than 15% of the population regular ly attend Church, whereas in the U.S.A. the figure is approximately 70%. The Working was intended to produce an even more civil, secular society which would be more tolerant towards minority religions such as the Temple of Set. Adept Parkin predicted the split in the Chur ch of England over the ordination of female clergy. The split would reduce the power of the Church, which lies in its land holdings and monetary funds, as well as its influence on Government. The ordination of female clergy"},{"pageNumber":1115,"pageContent":"would also rule out any closer links with the Vatican and Cat holicism, who are opposed to the ordination of females. \"There would be no need to replace Christianity with another belief system, as there would be a steady decline in the numbers of practicing Ch ristians in this count ry due to old age and death; and with the majority of the population being secular, th eir children would be raised in a secular environment with no need for such outdated belief systems.\" In a September 9 letter to Adept Parkin, Pr iest Dennis Man replied: \"Thank you for your insights into the numbers of C.O.E. churchgoers in the U.K., as well as the possible forthcoming split over ordaining female clergy.... I can cheer for your attempts to foster the circumstances for a civil, secular state with to lerance and justice for all.... I approve of the forward-looking, future-oriented vision that you both have. It was hard to see that in the Working that you did, but since you have now clar ified the object of your magical desires for me, I am much more reassured.\" Footnotes 1.

Fat Lady Ritual Classification: V2 - C31.I - 1 Author: Yolanda Anderson II° Date: February 15, XXIV HTML Revision: Dec 24, 1998 CE Subject: Weight Loss / Self Modification Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1118,"pageContent":"When a magician seeks to change something w ithin the self, it should be something that the magician really wants to change for a lot of deep-seated reasons. For instance, in my case I was sick and tired of seeing a fat lady looki ng out of the mirror at me. I was also in the process of totally ruini ng knee joints that had b een previously injured. And I knew that overeating was not really wort h the price I was paying for the pleasure. Unfortunately, I am self-indulgent enough that it was very hard for me to stick to a diet, especially when it just was not moving along at an acceptable rate of speed. The more I tried not to eat, the more I wanted to eat. And white-knuckling it does not work for me. Although I may not eat, I make everyone around me miserable. An additional factor that makes losing weight hard is that the body tries to protect you from starving -- your metabolism lowers, burns less fu el, and gains weight. A nd exercise does not bring the metabolism backup up that well. Oh, sure, you can lose a l ittle bit when you are actually exercising, but how long does one want to indulge in vigorous activity? Especially since most of it is dull. Therefore I decided that the way to solve the pr oblem was to get to the root of the thing, and get rid of the fat lady and all her little problems. I decided that in order to be effective, I would have to Work it in an exaggerated way -- in other words, from where I was headed at my current rate of gain. I also decided that I would have to make the fat lady a more or less complete person, which contained all the pers onality traits that caused fatness in me. This was the most time consuming activity, becau se it required a lot of analyses and thought. Fatness to some extent is an emotional disorder , and part of the solution seems to be getting rid of the \"fat\" emotions. In my case it incl uded eating when bored or upset, and to some degree \"hiding\" in the fat. Other factors involve d very bad eating habits, and an intense hatred for physical activity. Although, remembering, ther e was actually a time in my life that I enjoyed physical activities. Therefore I had the basis for the fat psychology. The most important thing here is the ability to really truly be ab le to visualize and completely project yourself into the visualization. To make things a li ttle more complicated, what we are trying to do here is to form two (not one) very vivid images, and to sort of split oneself into two distinct persons, so to speak: one person cont aining ALL of the traits to be discarded (and that is the important thing, one cannot leave behind any residue of the thing one wants to eliminate), and one person containing the traits that one wants to keep plus the ones one wants to gain. The visualization in this case was exaggerated a lot. I mean, we are talking FAT here -- our basic candidate for a side show as a matter of fact. And Ugly and Sloppy and with a lot of Laziness thrown in for good measure. This is the me that I am in danger of becoming. This is also a me that I want to avoid. Therefore it had to be as absolute ly horrible as I could make it. I pictured it standing in front of a refrigerator, poking candy an d cake into its mouth with both hands. It had uncombed hair, and of course was splitting the seam of its pants. The next step was the embodying of the total of myself into this awful person -- and that was the hard part. Although I had alrea dy planned a second visualization."},{"pageNumber":1119,"pageContent":"Now one virtually breaks oneself into two persons. We separate out all the fat traits -- love of food, hatred of exercise, slowed down metabolism, and the rest. In addition we threw in a feeling of inferiority and failure, and a lot of ot her negative traits, tra its that were slowing down the dieting process. Just recently I admitted th at in part there was a fear of change that was holding me back. When one is no longer fat one loses a rationalizatio n for a few of ones' other faults. Now the fat lady had to be sent away, with al l of the things that caused her existence, including a love of fattening food and a lot of laziness. This leaves behind the other visualization -- the slim and beautiful me that I would love to be. In fact, this is the me of my teen years. This me does not live to eat, and really does not even like all the so called goodies that are the fatty 's downfall. I recently came to the conclusion that to some extent this was a younger, health ier self, that got burie d under all the blubber, because somehow I regained an enjoyment of things like bike riding and jogging with the dog, things that I have not liked for a long time. I think to some degree I also adjusted my metabolism to a younger, healthier rate, although this is something I can only ascertain becau se of the ease with which the weight is disappearing (and by the fact that my energy le vel has increased a great deal -- I no longer drag around, forcing myself to do the things that need to be done; I bounce around). Now comes the hardest part -- forgetting about it and no longer having the fact that you are trying to lose weight be a majo r preoccupation in your life. The r eason for this is the fact that you are consciously telling yourself to forg et food brings the thought of food to the foreground. This is where I personally feel that a lot of so called self help programs fall down. Let's use A.A. as an example, because it is so publici zed. I think standing up in front of the room, and saying I am so and so and I am an alcoholic, just brings the problem into focus more, and makes leaving it behind a lot harder. With my Fat Lady Ritual the idea was the opposite -- it was to stop thinking fat, and therefore to step being fat. To some extent any bad hab it is a state of mind. The only thing that can truly solve the problem is to completely cha nge the \"mind set\" of the individual. In other words, it is a matter of building a new personality that does not include the characteristics that gave the prev ious one the problems that one is trying to solve. It was very important to no longer even think of myself as a dieter. I simply built a new person who did not have eating problems (or perhaps brought back the person within myself that did not have these problems, because at one time I weighe d 115 no matter what I ate). And then I started building a life style that does not center around food. I think that is the main thing to be accomplishe d in any ritual of this nature -- pointing where one wants to go, and Becoming what one wants to be. But the only way to do this is to leave behind all the excess baggage, and to know that one must be willing to make a very deep change for the better, and to know that any real change does to some extent have to come from the core of your very being -- what a lo t of people would call your self image. In other words, I can no longer think of myself as Fat, but as Becoming Slimmer and Healthier every day."},{"pageNumber":1120,"pageContent":"This whole ritual is designed as an exorcism of sorts -- although in stead of exorcising an invading entity, one is exorcising parts of oneself that one does not find useful or desirable at this time. And then there is the final thing: to get on with your life. That is another failing of traditional self help groups. The trend seems to be to sp end time forcing one to adapt into an unhealthy life style, instead of going on to something else that does no t require your bad habit as a coping mechanism. I think to some degree all sorts of problems c ould be solved by applying more or less the same techniques to change one's essential self. A nd that is basically what a major part of the Fat Lady Ritual was all about. I decided who and what I wanted to be. And then I threw away all the excess baggage that kept me from bei ng the more desirable self I wanted to be. Black Easter: A Working of Transmutation Purpose: This ritual was designe d to cause a \"transmutation\" of certain chosen aspects of my overall psyche that I felt had been or would interfere with my Quest for my Higher Magical Self. Through the process of G. B.M. ritual, certain chosen negative qualities were first highlighted, and then \"disintegrated\" into elem entary psychic components. These were then \"recombined\" to form more positive personality traits (positive in th e sense of supporting the above stated Quest). In summary, the ritual wa s designed to refine and remodel my Being to aid me in my Quest for my Higher Magical Self. Commentary: The ritual began in the early even ing of April 16, XXV. The first stage of this ritual comprised of a very extended comp ression period. This extended compression was deliberate. It was designed to give me the opportu nity to take account of my Magical career to date, to examine past interests, and to consider future directions of travel in my Quest. With this I then undertook a period of \"soul sear ching\", in which I took stock of what I felt to be elements of my present personality that were interfering with my long-term goals and potentials. I identified a numb er of items. These included a te ndency towards procrastination and a \"nihilistic rage\" that surfaces in my personality from time to time.

The possibl e outcomes caused by a successful Working were also considered. I considered the risk s of such psyche-modifying techniques to be controlled and commensurate with the likely results. The ritual proper began with th e striking of a gong and the nine-fold tolling of the bell. The Gate was then opened with the lighting of the Black Flame. I then began a personal Invitation to Set, the contents of which I had deliberately left open to be spontaneous and appropriate to the moment. It was very interesting to note th at I detected an \"extra\" something in the atmosphere at this stage. It was interesti ng and unexpected. The act ual contents of this invitation were basically a statement of kinshi p and purpose and a statement and expression of welcome. The next stage of the ritual followed after a brief pause. This was the Invocation of Anubis (see appendix 1 for the actual text of this pass age). The neter Anubis is a transformative neter, and thus the use or invocation of this neter for the related c oncept of Transmutation seemed appropriate. It should be noted th at I have been working with th is neter in a variety of ways since August XXIV. I proclaimed the Invocation in a firm and fier y manner. Dramatically, it was very effective, but it failed to evoke or rather manifest the neter lucidly within my psyche. In the past, using a reflective or even meditative approach within a G.B.M. context, I have achieved a far greater \"sense\" of the neter, and it has had quite clear and manifest results upon me. This is something I intend to investigate in the future, but is beyond the scope of this report, so I will not go into it further here. This did not perturb me, and I continued onto the next stage of the Working. This was the actual Working of the Transmutation principle, and the preliminary stages connected to it. The first step in the application of Transmutati on was to form a subjective or astral figure / form within my subjective universe that sym bolized what I felt were the detrimental or negative aspects of my personality (and possibly at deeper levels). This was, in effect, a form of Ka. When I had sufficiently substantiated this image within my subjective universe, I mentally linked this image to my ritual Grail. I then attempted the shift of perspective to this Ka figure that I had formed. After an extended effort, I managed to transfer my Ba to the Ka figure. As I had located the Ka within the actual Grail itself (physically), this meant that my cons cious energies were also shifted to the locus of the physical Grail. I experi enced some difficulty in doing this. In reflection, this was probably due to trying to maintain \"astral c onsciousness\" and trying to shift my mental energies to a specific locus point at the same time. (In the future when performing this ritual, I will not try to shift my psyche to a specific locus within the Grail. Instead, I will shift the Ba to the Ka as normal, and use the Grail as an outward, physical manifestation of any subjectiv e actions I may take. Thus the Grail will act both in the capacity of a \"mind mirror\" and as an \"earthing\" tool, in that it will link subjective actions to the objective world.) With the Ka figure fully actualized, I then pr oceeded to begin the Transmutation. This was done by placing the Grail above the Black Flame in my ritual chamber, and visualizing as lucidly as possible the Black Flame erupting a nd engulfing the Ka figure (my Self). I felt an"},{"pageNumber":1122,"pageContent":"unexpected sensation of being \"pen etrated\" by the Flame. It seemed to be both cutting into me and building me up at the same time. It was a st range experience, and is hard to communicate. I then focused on the disintegration of the negativ e aspects symbolized in the Ka. With effort, the Ka figure's shape began to slowly melt away until it became almost silhouette-like in the Black Flame, its form more sensed than seen. It was then, sensing that the di sintegrative aspect of this process was complete, that I then shifted my focus to Willing the changes I desired in my Being from the elementary psychic components left after the disintegration process. I then gradually began to change the shape and form of the Ka figure to match, symbolically , the qualities I felt w ould be beneficial to my Quest and which were connected to the nega tive qualities I had chos en for Transmutation. For some unknown reason at this stage, I seem ed to lose concentration for a brief moment. During this time I experienced a flickering sens ation as my point of perspective moved back and forth between my physical body and my Ka figure within the Grail. With effort, I managed to stabilize my projection. I then continued on with the Willing of my de sired changes. The Black Flame seemed to intensify slightly, as I rebuilt my subjective image up and more lucidly defined this Ka figure. This process continued for some time, and was quite intense. When I finally felt the process to be comple te, I willed the Black Flame to recede, and withdrew the Grail from over the physical Bl ack Flame. I then spoke the Grail passage (appendix 2), as I raised the Grail to my lips, drinking from it,and redirected my Ba back to my physical body. I experienced a very distinct \"s hift\" of consciousness when I did this, and I felt slightly alarmed for a short while afterwar ds. This slowly faded, and was replaced by a sense of \"aliveness\", of mental en ergy, and was extremely refreshing. After a short pause, I then began to read the Ei ghteenth Part of the Word of Set. This was done in a solemn manner. While reading this Part, I expe rienced a strange sense of timelessness. I felt like I was actually present at the Coming into Being of the Word of Set, when it was first manifested and articulate d in human language. This was very queer. (It should be noted that in August XXIV I undertook an illustrative ritual designed to facilitate a greater Understanding and feel for the Word of Set. Wh ile this did not seem to produce much in the way of note, a stra nge set of dreams occurred for several nights afterwards. One of these was very significant. Interestingly, it was connected with Anubis. Whether the two events are connected in some wa y remains open for speculation.) Upon completing the reading of the Eighteenth Part of the Word of Set, I then quietly closed the Gate and extinguished the Black Flame. I then again rang the bell nine times, and then struck the gong as a definite closing act to the ritual. With the ritual over, I went to the end of my chamber and sat in a chair located there and rested. I felt physically drained, but my mental energy was about normal, except that I had developed a headache of a moderately severe nature. This was unusual, as I do not normally get headaches at all. I rested there for a few mi nutes, and then left the chamber. That was the end of the ritual.

This rite was composed by Magister Robert Me nschel, whose Name is Shuti. He is Grand Master of the Order of Shuti, named after the twin lion gods of ancient Egypt, Shu and Tefnut. He is a founding member of both the Order of Bast and the Order of Sekhmet. Since the current war is being fought in the middle east, near Egypt, and invo lves Egyptian forces, it Classification: V2 - C31.P - 3 Author: Robert Menschel IV° Date: February 24, XXVI HTML Revision: Dec. 18, 1998 CE Subject:   Protection   Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1127,"pageContent":"is fitting to use Egyptian mythology and symbol ism, namely the three great feline goddesses, for this rite. This rite of protection was written to be just part of a larger working, and the participants therefore took advantage of that larger working, and its concomitant energy and power. They were instructed (1) to not invoke these three forces na med below earlier in the working, but instead when it was time for this rite, to i nvoke these forces with all the power they had accumulated during the process of the working. The major force called upon is Sekhmet, the feline goddess of war, and also of protection against violence. Budge begins to discuss Sekhmet (under the name Sekhet) in his Gods of the Egyptians , and that is a good enough introduction fo r those who are not familiar with this neter. There is no adequate introduction to Tefnut; sh e is the most occult / hidden of all major Egyptian gods ... she is fog and darkness and blur compared to Shu's clarity, light, and preciseness. Suffice it to say she is Sekhmet's co usin, also a lioness, and the two were often considered one, or were even merged into one in later Egyptian times. She is also a goddess of force, of destruction, and of love. Finally, Bast is cat rather than lioness, more peaceful, friend lier, softer. A clawed huntress, she relishes life and comfort also. The three goddesses are called upon to protect Ad ept Bozeman (and other Setians involved in Operation Desert Storm) from harm, and to br ing him back to his family and his love. The rite below was written to be spoken by each participant. It parallels Shuti's statements during the rite (ie: where this ritual mentions Shuti in the third person, he used the first). These words are Shuti's, not yours. Therefore they are not the best for you to use. Adapt them however you see fit, to make them meaningf ul and powerful for you. Further, these exact circumstances will not again be duplicated (the se Setians, or Operation Desert Storm). You will need to modify the invocations and other statements accordingly. Among its other attributes, Nine is the magical number of completion, of established fact. This attribute is strengthened when Nine is formed by Three three times . This rite therefore invokes Three thrice. There are three portions of incense burned (or th ree candles lit, as discussed below), three claps of sound (bell or palms), and three directions or Neters. While the words and visualizations can be modified as needed to increase the meaning and impact of the rite, this basic structure should be maintained. Preparation: To increase our rapport with Sekhmet, we invol ve dry heat. Everyone should have at least one charcoal lit. Assuming you li ght one piece of charcoal well before starting your main working, you may wish to light a second just before starting that working, so that this second coal will have plen ty of heat left for this porti on, even if the first has burned through. If you have powdered incense, place a few grains of your driest incense on a 1\" square of paper, and fold the paper around the incense. Pr epare three incense pack ages this way. The"},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"intent is to provide the smell and smoke of in cense along with the fire of the incense. When indicated, place one package on the charcoal , and blow lightly (to provide enough air movement to cause the paper to flame). You ma y want to pass the paper through the flame of a candle first, to ensure it flames. If you don't have powdered incense or charcoal, scented candles can be used instead. Use those with light and dry scents, rather than heavy and fruity or wet scents. We will be calling upon the Hidden aspects of Te fnut, those which confuse or misdirect sight. The smoke of the incense can be considered part of this activity. You may also wish to use a light and mostly translucent veil when a ppropriate, to illustrate this effect. Finally, Bast always responds best when her ow n are involved in ritu al. If you have cat(s) who are familiar with ritual, their presence can enhance the cerem ony.

He also suggested th at the Enochian Keys were symbolic of the Great Magical (18-year) Cycle, and that they Keys reflected each one of the years. The three Priestesses further speculated the following: The Enochian Keys are reflections, images of the real Truth behind them (i.e.: Pl ato's cave), and \"are but a shadow of my true Word...\" The Enochian Keys are reflections in a mirror, but once we recognize the reflected Self in that mirror, we can pass through the mirror to our former and future Selves -- the reality of which the Keys can only reflect as shadows.

All matters of terrestrial concern may be evaluated by the infallible resolution of nine [again] and its offspring. Action and reaction relative to human ity's tribal needs are contained within successive nine-year periods: The total of both (18 years) is called a Working. The beginning and end of each Working is called a Working Year and each midway point between the Working Years displays a zenith of intensity fo r the Working which has been brought about.\" Working A free association discussion befo re the opened gates gradually turned into a ritual: After the gates were opened, we first became aware of \"m irrors.\" There is the mirror within our Selves, and we have the duty and the ability to become masters of the mirror - and the Right, for that is who we are. Clearly one aspect of Xem is th e ability to see the Self using the Mirror. There are ways of ascertaining that we have used the mirror. We are also a mirror to others. They can look and See their Selves and make a choice. The crystal is a cloudy mirror. Priestess Reynolds saw herself in close iden tification with the god Xonsu. She also saw a man, wearing a blue and white nemes; he was clean and neat, attend ed by two brown, male, naked slaves / servants (?) in an opulent setting. Around him we re silvery notched columns. Priestess Sarris, in looking through the pentagra m, saw the brilliant night sky, and heard the words that we are the \"priestesses of our own te mples; we are the 'dwellers in the Void.'\" We order our Selves; each one separate, unique, distin ct; and being whole - we come together in cooperation, not expressions of Pandemonium this time.

He said that Set ha d revealed the \"phi\" triangle burned into his Xemset rock, and that he was now trying to build a triangular, not quadrangular pyramid around it. During the working itself, we all three receiv ed emphatic impressions of \"three\" in many triadic forms. The most obvious triad was that of Amen (father, abstract thought, the Invisible Air -- Bushey), Mwt (mother, concrete idea, carr ier / nurturer of the cosm ic egg -- Sarris), and Xonsu (child, expression of the two ideas jo ined, the cosmic egg \"hatched\" -- Reynolds). Indeed, in post-ritual discussion, it became clear that the triangle and fertility had some strong connection with visions and impressions we rece ived: Mwt, the eye in the triangle; Amen, the great white ovoid / cosmic egg; Xonsu, cr ystal surrounding the \"nameless card\" / the \"nameless function,\" first uncovered, then retu rned beneath stones, sh attering when touched by \"disruption\", then reforming anew. We fina lly perceived that the crystal was Ma'at. In the post-ritual discussion we realized a nother triad had been re vealed by the Working, whose significance we are still unable to e xplain fully, of category distinctions among members of the Order that might aid in defini ng our magical relationshi ps. The classifications were Male, Female, and Neither. Moreover, they can only manifest themselves at the III°+ level and are only recognizable in Ma'at with our sense of Set. Below that level, mundane personality decisions intrude. No sexual preferences, no persona lities, no mundane characteristics of any kind were considered; i.e. : a biological male mi ght be classified as Male, Female, or Neither. Males and Females exhibit distinct characteristics of maleness or femaleness, either as active / passive tendencies in the magical sense or that their Neters express masculine or feminine traits, such as \"active / reactive\", while the Neithers exhib it \"responsive\" traits, since they are not limited to bipolar distinctions. Neithers respond to Neithers and react to the others, while the Males and Females react to every categ ory. Opposites and Sames attract each other because they need an \"identifiable polarity\", while Neithers attract one another. Although they can interact with Males an Females, they feel most at ease within their category. Males and Females interact best with Neithers when th e Neithers tend to take on the qualities of the person's opposite (i.e.: a Neither dealing with a Male would take on Fema le characteristics). Often these magical classifications are also reflected in the f unctional and mundane aspects of the person's being; they are not static, but are subject to chan ge according to the progressive or regressive evolution of the individua l. We individually found that our personal classifications dovetailed perfec tly among us, but interesting e nough, between the time of this working in September and the preparation of th is article in mid-April, classifications had changed. Males and Females can become Neither s by balancing the element that is missing -- which is reminiscent of Anubis' oft-repeated statement that a magician must become ambisexual. Subject: Triads, Sexuality Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1138,"pageContent":"Skinwalker Ritual I. Background The Dinee (Navajo) are a Native American peopl e resident in the Southwest. They have a strong R.H.P. culture which includes a very ex pansive view of the earth and the state of beauty that may be achieved through balance within natural systems. Dinee culture has extensive diagnostic and heal ing rituals for dealing with both physical and emotional imbalances (illnesses). The Dinee di agnosticians (which include crystal gazers, hand tremblers, etc.) are employed to diagnose an imbalance, and working with a Singer (\"medicine man\"), they recommend what type of Sing must be done in order that healing (physically, spiritually, and emotionally) may occu r. The healing ritual itself involves sweat lodges, sandpainting(s), Sings, etc. It is a long, expensive proce ss that usually involves other family (clan) members. The Songs that are employed are drawn from a variety of mythological stories. Each is designed toward the restoration of harmony in the affected individual. Sings are very complex, and can last for days. The order of events runs roughly as follows. Th e affected person calls for a diagnostician. The diagnostician reads the signs and recommends a Sing. A Singer is then called for. He will organize the event, supervise the creation of the sandpaintings, do the chanting (sing the \"way\"), prescribe herbs/emetics/sweats as needed, and oversee the removal of the sandpainting once the Sing is completed. (The so urce of the imbalance that is causing the affected individual to be out of harmony is thought to be transmitted into the sandpainting during the Sing, thus the victim is restored.) Information about the Dinee R.H.P. is readily available. However, the Skinwalker Working seeks to access the L.H.P. of the Dinee. This has been heavily suppressed by the Dinee themselves, as well as by the White overculture. It is relatively easy to acqui re popular information about Skin walkers. Any Dinee can tell tales of witchcraft and murder. Some will even make accusations. However, separating the truth from the hysteria is n early impossible unless you have access to a Navajo Wolf (Skinwalker) who ha s been initiated. II. What are Skinwalkers? They're known as Skinwalkers, Navajo Wolves , Shape-shifters, Dinee Werewolves, Dinee Witches, and so on. They're feared by most of th e inhabitants of Dinetah (the homeland of the Classification: V2 - C32.A - 1 Author: Col-lea Lane II° Date:  March,  XXVIII  HTML Revision: N ov 29, 1998 CE Subject: Skinwalking; Native American (S.W.) Black Magic Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1139,"pageContent":"traditional Dinee). They are credited with murder , crop failures, incest, miscarriages, illness, too much rain, not enough rain, disasters (nat ural and not), and communication with wolves, bears, snakes, and lightning. They ar e the \"bogeymen\" of the Dinee. In reality they are Sorcerers -- Black Magicians who seek fo rbidden knowledge. I will go into this \"forbidden knowledge\" later. When dealing with Skinwalkers and their ritual s, it is imperative that we understand the cultural implications. Many Dinee live in prim itive conditions by choice (ie: no electricity, plumbing, or running water). They live in harmony with nature, with littl e or no change from generation to generation. This lack of cha nge, coupled with limite d exposure to outside influences, results in a closed society. As in most closed societies, gossip and superstition become the main diversions. Scapegoats are crea ted for all manner of troubles and tragedies. Eventually, after enough repetition, gossip and su perstition are taken as fact and a dangerous situation arises. It is an unfor tunate aspect of human nature to believe that by destroying the scapegoat, the problem will be resolved. Thus it is that sometimes a Dinee suspected of being a Skinwalker is murdered. Hence, Skinwalkers are extremely discreet about their rituals and beliefs. All are \"underground.\" III. Forbidden Knowledge, Sh ape-Shifting, and Flight The forbidden knowledge of the Skinwalker is much like the forbidden knowledge of the Setian. It is the knowledge of Self and the empowerment of Will. The Wolf methods for achieving the same involve the use of Shape-sh ifting, Gate-walking, and ritual. I will address the ritual later. Shape-shifting is essentially the ability to empl oy the characteristics of the wolf (increased sensory awareness, speed and agility, predator y cunning, clan telepathy, etc.) [note: Some Shape-shifters prefer to send the Self into a wolf's body instead of absorbing the wolf's abilities.] Once a Navajo Wolf has become a wolf s/he (1) may choose to further shift into some other totem animal. The Skinwalker would then take on the characteristics of the second creature. Gate-walking is my own term for the Skinwalk er method of venturing into new planes of existence. This can be something as simple as cr ossing into the past or future. It can also be the opening of a Gate to another place: another desert or anothe r city or another continent or another world or another universe. Willed Flight is an important part of Skinwalk er training. It is the pr ojection of Self through the physical (and non-physical) realm. It is used in some types of shape-shifting and gate- walking. Willed Flight is also a stand-alone process th at is also known as out of body or astral projection. Aside from the obvious benefits, Shape-shifting, Gate-walking, and Fli ght are the techniques by which the Skinwalker learns to become detached from his physical envelope while retaining the Self and evolving beyond death. Di sincorporation into the all-nothingness is the spiritual end of the R.H.P. Dinee: the chindi (\"bad\" self, ghost) ride s the night and the \"good\" self simply loses awareness. To a Skinwalker, Self-annihilation is a waste. Much like the Tolteca priesthood, the Wolves will Gate-walk to avoid death."},{"pageNumber":1140,"pageContent":"IV. Trickster -- Generator of the Skinwalkers The Navajo Wolf owes his abilities to the instru ction of his Daemon: Tric kster. It is a name employed by many cultures, in many ways. The La kota (Sioux) use the term to denote Coyotl. The Skinwalker Trickster is not Coyotl. He is the Daemon Wolf -- the Daemon which taught certain Dinee the powers of Skinwalking. He is the Generator (fat her/mother) of the Skinwalkers. Thus it is the Daemon Trickster whom a Skinwalker honors by wearing the wolf pelt draped upon his shoulders. It is always difficult to be accurate when cros sing cultural lines to find comparisons. This case is no different. I have been asked if Trickster correlates to the Norse Loki. This may very well be. I am far from expert in the Norse reli gion/cosmogony. However, if I may be permitted an indulgence, I feel more of a connection between Trickster and Fenrir (Fenris). This connection goes deeper than the outward appearance of a wo lf. Fenrir is feared because of his power and the premonition that he will de stroy the established hierarchy at Ragnarok. If death itself is viewed as a sort of persona l Ragnarok, then Trickster is providing for the destruction of the established sequence. Instead of dropping th e physical envelope and fading into the all-nothingness, the Skinwalker is em powered to break free from the chains with which the natural gods have imprisoned him. Fu rther, the Skinwalker can cause the personal cataclysm that destroys the natural way and al lows him to Gate-walk away from death and into immortality. Thus, the old, natural way has lost its control and been made impotent. V. Why Would a Setian Wish to Do a Skinwalker Working? This is one of the questions that Priest McGranahan has asked me to address in this paper. It is an excellent question. Since I cannot speak for anyone but myself, my an swer will necessarily be subjective. It is imperative that I continue to Xeper on ce my Self has separated from my body. To do this, I must be adept at controlling a nd directing that which comprise s my essence. It would seem that continual practice at what is termed astral projection would allow me to become used to functioning in a non-corporeal state. To this end I am experimen ting with the Skinwalker style of Self projection (Willed Flight). Additionally, I am personally in terested in Gate-walking. I cannot imagine a more efficient means of travel and experientia l learning. Finally, there is much knowledge to be gained from other species. One method of achie ving this is to take on the char acteristics of said species. And then there is the know ledge to be acquired from the Daemon Trickster. VI. How Will this Help You Xeper? This is another question that I have been asked. I feel that this one can only be answered on an individual basis. After reading this paper, each Setian will have to decide whether participation will have meaning for him."},{"pageNumber":1141,"pageContent":"VII. The Ritual Site and Chamber For this ritual, desert energy is best. If you won't have access to an isolated spot in the desert, I would recommend any outdoor area where you can proceed uninterrupted. If an outdoor ritual is not possible, you will need to cons truct an indoor \"hogan\" (a sort of oblong house with a smoke hole in the middle of the ceiling). Skinwalkers traditionally perform portions of the ritual in a cave. This allows for a sandpainting on the floor, as well as wall and ce iling paintings. (I will discuss the actual artwork later on.) If a cave is not han dy, construct a \"hogan\" as best you can. My recommendation would be to use canvas dr op-cloths or sheets. The surface must not be waterproof, as you are going to need to paint on it. When constructing your chamber, leave a smoke hole (at least 2 feet wide) in the cen ter of the chamber ceiling (from which you can view the stars). If your chamber will be indoors, put a picture of Set's constellation on the ceiling above the smoke hole. (Try to get the kind of picture/poster that reflects light.) [Note: Do not build a fire inside the \"hogan\" -- the walls are flammable.] If you are constructing an outdoor chamber, try to include an area for a fire pit outside the chamber. If you are Working inside a house, a fireplace may substitute. It is important to understand that the fire pit is to be located outside the chamber/hogan. \"Smoke hole\" refers to the common name given to the opening, not to any actual use in this case. To have a fire pit inside the chamber/hogan would be dangerous. Prior to the ritual, it is traditiona l to perform a sweat lodge. If you decide to do this, be certain that the rocks you heat up do not come from a wa tercourse or the bed of a former watercourse. Also avoid rocks that have crystal in them. All three types are likely to explode when you pour water onto them. VIII. Requirements 1. Needed per individual: 1. A wolf pelt to be fraped over the pa rticipant's shoulders. I have had many discussions lately regarding the use of the pelt. Setians who are only going to perform this ceremony once or twice might want to examine their need for an actual pelt, especially in view of the recent human assault upon the wolf community. Instead, it is possible to subs titute a \"shawl\" which has a picture of a wolf in/on it. The representation of th e wolf could be woven into or painted onto the \"shawl.\" The \"shawl\" must be large enough to drape over your back and shoulders, down to your waist -- and stay there. It should be a medium-to- heavyweight, so as to keep you aware th at it is there. St rips coming over the shoulders and hanging down the chest will sufficiently imitate the legs of the pelt, as well as help to keep it on you shoulders. 2. A knife 3. A few strands of (your own) hair and a few of (your own) nail parings 4. Any personal fetishes, medicine ba gs, etc. that you may need 5. A drum (or other musical instrument if it is appropriate to the style of this ritual) 2. Needed per group: 1. Colored sand/dirt, pollen, corn meal, cr ushed mineral oxides (colors needed: black, red, brown, blue, yellow)"},{"pageNumber":1142,"pageContent":"2. Wood and kindling for the fire pits 3. Blankets or tarps for the sweat lodge (a s well as a previously dug and set fire pit in which to heat rocks) 4. A bucket and dipper for the water 5. Several pairs of heavy tongs (to carry the rocks with) 6. Several pairs of oven mitts 7. A plant mister 8. Food 9. Water -- the purest you can find. Be careful if you are using water from a pond or lake (or slow-moving stream). Nowada ys the water tends to be polluted. 10. Grael -- to hold the water. Let me explain the significance here. If you live in a desert, water takes on an entirely new meaning. During the dry s easons it's difficult to find enough to sustain life. During the rainy season it trie s to kill you (in flash floods, hail). In the desert, water is life and death. It is also that from which we sprang; and it has some of the qualities that we asso ciate with conscious ness (reflection and reception). 11. Pinon incense. This is the s cent of the Southwestern Desert. The Pinon Pine is a hardy tree, twisted into shapes of outstanding beaut y. Its nuts are a delicious food, and its \"body\" offers a home to ma ny creatures. Once you have breathed in the fragrance of this wood, you will ne ver forget it. The incense made from it is readily available. If you cannot find it, let me know. If you want to entice the Daemon Tricks ter to visit your Sing, I suggest you scent the path to your chamber and al so the chamber itself with pinon. 12. The final ingredient is one that some male Setians may have a difficult time dealing with -- menstrual blood. It is a tr aditional component of the Skinwalker sandpaintings. (2) IX. The Sandpainting A sandpainting is a \"picture\" made of sand/ dirt, corn meal, pollen, crushed mineral ores/oxides, etc. It is crea ted through a long, laborious proces s calling for intense patience. The media being used is taken into the fist and slowly dribbled out from the back of the hand or from between the thumb and index finger. I suggest that anyone not familiar with this method practice prior to the actual ritual. It is not an easy t echnique to master. However, it will teach you to focus. (3) The sand/dirt should be as blac k as possible, and can be obtained from any source. The pollen is av ailable in most health food st ores. Corn meal, both the light and deep yellows, is available in any grocery store of size. The crus hed minerals (red and yellow ochre) may be found in any Native Ameri can crafts store, as is the pinon incense. The \"floor\" of the chamber or cave should be covered in black dirt/sand. The sandpainting may then be created upon it. In the archetyp al Skinwalker sandpainting samples presented here, the traditional Dinee R.H.P. rainbow/sky is replaced by a (red and black) snake -- the carrier of kinetic energy. On its back are blue and yellow zi g-zags that represent lightning. The snake forms a \"U.\" The open end should f ace South (the home of Trickster). The area"},{"pageNumber":1143,"pageContent":"inside the \"U\" is black. Upon it are sandpainted two figures, execute d in standard Dinee style. These figures are of a human and a shap e-shifter wolf joined at the hand. The human's flesh is red with black eyes and ha ir; its clothing is brown (to represent the wolf pelt). The shape-shifter wolf ha s flesh of brown, its eyes are re d, and its clothing is dark blue (like the night sky). The feathers may be whatever color you wish. If you are light-skinned you may wish to use th e light yellow corn meal for the human flesh. Blonds and redheads would use cornmeal and red ochre respectively (for the hair). If you are of mixed blood such as I am, the human's flesh should be half red and half yellow, divided vertically. Black magicians would use the blac k earth. I have included examples of both the male and female subjects. The menstrual blood is mixed into the red ochre prior to its use as the outline of the snake and the eyes of the shape-shifter. Ad j'abani (Bat) is drawn at the mouth of the \"U\" as the facil itator of movement and communica tion. It is drawn in black and red. The sandpainting I have described is enclosed in a giant Pentagra m, drawn in red. This is, of course a Setian touch to honor Set. Each \"leg\" of the pentagram should have a reproduction of the central sandpainting in it. A participant stan ds inside each \"leg\" of the pentagram. If you have more than six participants, repeat the sandp ainting in the areas outsi de the \"legs,\" inside the enclosing circle. In this way you increase you r number of potential par ticipants to eleven. Traditionally, a sandpainting is removed and bur ied after its use in order to destroy it. However, Skinwalkers are not subject to the same superstitions as the traditional Dinee, and Setians are definitely not. Therefore, I recomm end that the sandpainting be left intact. The paintings on the walls of the chamber or cav e should represent other totems which will be used such as bears, cats, etc. You may also use the same animals as are in the sandpainting, engaged in different activities. Examples of this would be Bat flying in the solar system, or snake doing healing, etc. The ceili ng painting should be of the stars. If you can, reverse the image so that the sky is light grey and the stars are black. X. The Sing To the Dinee a particular sandpainting is used together with a specific Sing to accomplish a result such as healing. The Skinwalker has more of an open-ended philosophy. The Navajo Wolf will design his sandpainting and Song ar ound whatever it is that he is trying to accomplish (such as shape-shifting or Gate-walking). The reason we will be using the sandpainting I have described is because we are doing thus as novices. If you go on to experiment with Skinwalker energy, you will ev entually design your own artwork. However, for this ritual I ask that all participants keep to the shape- shifter sandpainting which I have designed. The artwork for the walls and ceiling may be of your own design. As regards your Song, it is important that you write the words in whatever language is personally appropriate. The topic for same can be shape-shifting, Gate-walking, Flight, contacting Trickster or such. I clothe my Sings in Skinwalker/Dinee mythos. This is workable for me because I know some of the culture a nd mythology. If you don't know or want to work with the Skinwalker mythos, then simply stay with the topics listed above. There is more about the Sing and the sa ndpainting in \"The Ri tual\" section."},{"pageNumber":1144,"pageContent":"XI. The Ritual The order of events runs as follows: 1. Arrive and set up camp at least seven hours before the ritual is scheduled to start. Take plenty of time creating, a nd plenty of rests between act ions, so as not to become stressed out or exhausted. 2. Create the sandpaintings. Take a plant mist er (mist spray bottle ) with you. As you complete a section of the sandpain ting, LIGHTLY mist it. (Be careful not to let drops of water fall onto it, or they will wreck th e sandpainting.) Misting will help set it as well. Also take care that you subdue any br eeze coming into the area in which you are working. Otherwise you will have pollen, etc. blowing everywhere. Figure at least two hours for the creation of the basic sandpainting. Add hour for each sandpainting in addition to the centr al one within the pentagram. To paint the walls and ceili ng, add water to the crushed minerals and/or use water- based tempers. These paintings should not cover the entire surface of the wall or ceiling. Instead they should be the size of a window, with each wall having one painting. 3. If you have a large group, you can split up into smaller groups: sandpainting, wall and ceiling painting, rock gathering, fire pit digging, and sweat lo dge building. In this way all tasks may be accomplished simultaneously. You will need two fire pits: a deep one in which to heat the rocks for the sweat lodge, and a shallow one for cooking food. The (sweat) fire pit must be dug early and the fire started. As soon as the fire burns to coals, put the rocks i n, and cover loosely with more li ve coals or dry wood. After an hour or so the rocks will be ready. Use oven mitts and tongs to carry the rocks. Be certain to clear the path be tween the fire pit and the sweat lodge of anything that can or will burn. If you drop one of the rocks and it lands on a twig, you will have a fire. Remember to avoid rocks that come from th e bed of a watercourse or have crystal in them. Once heated, they will explode when water is poured upon them. The sweat lodge is basically a large, round room created by bending saplings and tying them together. They are then covered with blankets. You can also bring prefabricated poles and use them. The door is covered with only a light cloth, and should face south. The center of the lodge has a pit lined with unheated rocks dug into the floor. Pile the heated rocks on top of the unheated rock s. Once everyone has entered and seated themselves, water is gently ladled (not splashed) onto the rocks, creating steam. (4) During the sweat, an induction should be performed. This will put everyone in the correct state for the ritual. If you are fortunate enough to have been present during one of Priestess Lance's inductions, you will know the type of hypnotic induction I am referring to. Clothes may be worn into the sweat lodge, or the participants may be naked. This is a personal choice."},{"pageNumber":1145,"pageContent":"The sweat itself should last for no more th an hour. After the half hour mark, the blankets are removed from the sweat lodge to let in the ai r and \"revive\" the participants. All participants then rinse off w ith cool water and dress for the rest of the ritual. 4. The participants don their wo lf pelts or \"shawls,\" and move into the chamber/cave housing the sandpainting, taking with them th eir drums (or other musical instruments). Each goes to his place on the sandpainting. The chamber/cave should be candle lit so that everyone can see. The Black Flame shoul d be lit and laid upon a small altar to the south of the sandpainting. 5. Invocation to Set and the Trickster Hail Set. Prince of Darkness. Tonight we descend through a new Gate, clothed in the mantle of an old Daemon. Come with us upon this journey, and greet the Daemon Trickster, the Daemon Wolf, the Generator of Skinwalkers. Hail Set. Hail Trickster. Come to us from your home in the so uth. Move through the east, the north, and the west, stirring the night. We welcome you with the fires of Hell, the waters of the eternals, the night airs, and the colored earth of change. (5) 6. The drumming starts (drums and pe rcussion only at this point). 7. The individual Sings commence with the central sandpainting leading. The Sings are done while standing, sitting, or laying on the sandpainting, with your head and as much of your torso as possi ble inside the \"U\" of the snake. As each individual completes his Sing, he or she lays down his instrument and picks up the knife. A shallow hole is then dug within an area of the sandpainting (off to the side so as not to interfere with laying down). Into this is placed the individual's hair and nail parings. This is covered over, and the knife is plunged into it. The Singer then assumes a position conducive to skinwalking. The order in which the indi vidual Sings are done must follow a prearranged plan. Allow lots of time for each individual's Wor k. If Gate-walking occurs, the participant may be gone for a while. In order that ev eryone has their opportunity, specify a time limit prior to the onset of the ritual. This w ill, of course, have to be approximated once you are in the ceremony. Once the time limit ha s been exceeded, the next participant should start. Oftentimes, three or four part icipants will be skinwalking at the same time. 8. As each participant \"returns,\" he should retrieve his instrument and begin playing softly. When all of the participants have \"returned,\" the playing should rise to a crescendo and stop. The participants then move off of the sandpainting to allow \"transmission\" of the accumulated energy into the night. 9. The Singers then remove their knives and musical instruments, leave the chamber/cave, and reassemble at the (cooking) fire pit. The fire is lit and the feasting and dancing start!

Through the use of consciousness altering atmospheres and a deliberate concentration of the will within the magician's magical chamber, the potential for Setanically augm ented consciousness is greatly improved. Submerged creative facilities are amplified, and constricting paramete rs inherent in the objective universe are removed. To state it another way, the Rites of Yuggoth is a working of willful insanity through possession, or through contact with the Satanic mind. The first part of this ritual was executed on Walpurgisnacht of 1980 C.E., and incorporated more or less state of the art equipment most employable to trapezoidal workings. Six years later saw th e second half of this working in a more powerful form. This current ritual is a documentation from that working. It is fully expected that the third working shall surpass the aforementioned rituals by utilization of the most advanced instrumentation and principles available. Chamber atmosphere: Culthulian neter-forms invoked during preliminaries to the Techno-Magical aspects of the Rites of Yuggoth dictate the vibrational and visu al constitution of the chamber atmosphere. Elemental synthesis is determin ed by objective magical tool employment, and the chamber is charged in accordance to first form principles. These neter-forms and their correlations will be explained later in this thesis. Function of Magical Weapons (Synthes izer Applications to the Law of the Trapezoid): Cerebral alteration and identification synthe sis are resultant byproducts of resonant bombardment of the psyche due to the e xposure of Phi-Ratio tonal angular patterns. (1) The angular configuration of the geometry constituting this sound can produce psyche altering states of enhanced magical awareness in the ritual chamber, allowing the sorcerer greater access to the subjective universe via overcompensation of objective universe peripheries. My synthesizer ha s a memory patch entitled the Sith Dirge , a phi-rationed Satanic musical wave form.

The gong surface itself is a pentagonal figure construc ted of 3/16\" industrial 306 sheet stainless, and hangs within a trapezoidal yoke confi guration designed to accommodate various electronic sound altering devices, such as a Digitec SP2100 echo and sampling unit, Digitec octaplus, and Digitec phase shifter. The striking of the gong nine times preparatory to the invocation acts as a purification of all objective thought processes and mindsets anathema to the magician's desired goals. The number nine is significant to the rite in view of its amalgamated nature of Indulgence, word of the aeon of Satan, numb er of its Magus, Anton Szandor LaVey, and as a courtesy to the Council of Nine. Phi-Resonator: The third element comprising the Rites of Yuggoth phi-attack mode is a device of my own creation called a Phi-Resonator. Basically, the device is an electrostatically stimulated tuning fork of the same frequency as phi, and as are the other sound generating equipment in this ritual, capable of having the sound capabilities altered due to the addition of added components. The resonato r is activated during the litany, and the number of repeat emissions is controlled by a preset pulse generator. Electronic Voice Modulation: One of the most powerful weapons within the magician's black arsenal is the Voice. It has been my personal experien ce that Satanic languages such as the Enochian Keys, Word of Set, and Cthulian chants, as power ful as they are, can be doubly magnified through the avenues of electronic manipulation processing and augmentation. I use a Bell Laboratories electr onic voice processor and a Digitec multieffects unit to alter the speed, depth, density, and tone of my voic e, as well as adding nuances of echo, phase shift, distortion, and octave alteration. Thus, by emphasizi ng specific language syntax groupings or words of power, in simultaneous concert with synthesizer phi-generation, and additional gong vibrational emplacement, I can triple the vibrational density of the chamber, resulting in a higher degree of co ntrol in the personalized environment that might otherwise not exist using more traditional methods. Truly the Weirding Way! Lighting: For this working I required a very dense beam of light since it would be forming the boundaries (symbolically) between the profane objective universe ruled by stasis, rest, and acquiescence, and the highly creative, care fully controlled, alien subjective universe."},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"Visual separation is one of the keys to th e \"obscene angles\" or door through the space- time continuum that the magician seeks to overcome. Consequently, a small helium-neon laser of no more than .08 milliwatts was sele cted for this purpose. The laser is activated early in the ritual, forming a visual separation of the postulant from the objective universe. Tesla Coil: This instrument is steadily becoming synonymous with anything involving aspects of techo-magic. Since its rather informal introduc tion to Satanic Magic in the United States via Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey's Satanic Rituals (2) , it has found itself at home in the Temple of Set's reconstituted Order of the Trapezoid, as well as the Asylum of Satan, my personal Black Magical Laboratory. I have been using the instrument since 1980, and employ it as a standard working device in nearly all my rituals. The coil frequencies should be tuned as close to the phi-ratio as mechanical measures will allow, in this way the chamber can be permeated with large doses of electromagnetic vibrations and ionization. The coil should be powerful enough to influe nce the chamber to a noticeable degree. I have used coils as well as Van de graaff ge nerators with voltage discharges of 50 volts through 3 million volts, and of course chamber size dictates the power needs of the discharge device to be employed. The Rites of Yuggoth was performed in a circular chamber 50 feet across, and so a Tesla coil of no less than 3 million volts worked excellently. Commercial units proving expensive as well as limited in their production (they're usually not constructed with black magical principles in mind), I chose to build my own. The completed unit stands three and a half feet tall, is mount ed on a specially constructed trapezoidal base, and in place of the dischargin g screw mounted at the apex of the unit, an inverted pentagram serves as the focus for the bolts of the Dark Light to come forth from the angles of the trapezoid, opening the Ge netic Memory Door and illuminating the Way, or Xem, to the evolutionary ends of the Black Magician. (3) Fog Discharge Machine: To simulate the formless void of the objecti ve universe, as well as a psycho-symbolic representation of the ethereal atmosphere of the realm of Yuggoth, I employ a large fog generating pump. Note: The inherent worth of any of these devices resides solely in the magician's ability to assign worth to them. They are the tools of the effective sorcerer, and phi-keys to the door of the trapezoid. They are not inherently sacred unto themselves, and possess no oxi-esoteric power. Nor are they to be considered fancy and useless props being employed for \"newness\" sake."},{"pageNumber":1150,"pageContent":"The power is within the Self and the Gift of Set to use the Black Flame of enlightenment to our most creative and evolutionary means.

Note: The World of Horrors, or state of being that the soul, psyche , or consciousness might find itself after the demise of the fleshly shell, would indeed be a terrifying place for a profane consciousness to find itself in. (The numbing shock of not finding oneself in monastic reunification with the blessed bo som of Christ would be tantamount to the supreme terror, the acknowledgeme nt of being totally alone.)"},{"pageNumber":1154,"pageContent":"Shub-Niggurath: Lord of the Fourth Angle.

They can be identified with the essence of the post-Seraphic War Lucifer-Satan thesis / antitheses / synthesis creative equation, an d the nine angles in their entirety. The Hornless Ones of the Fifth Angle: The Children of Darkness, the Elect of Set. Those Self- and psyche-exalted beings that have recognized their unique standing in the Kingdom of Shadows. As the demonic architect s of the Temple of the Five Trihedrons (Church of Satan / Temple of Set), the Master s of this infernal tribunal are charged with the responsibility of processing and evaluating the Human condition of the Elect so as to bring it to its next stage of internal evolut ion, the Noetic perception of the Quasiarch Haderach or Super Being within each of us. (See Frank Herbert's Dune Trilogy.) From the Sixth Angle is the Sleep of the Daemons in Symmetry, which doth vanquish the Five but shall not prevail against the Four and the Nine. The Sleep of the Daemons in Symmetry is a reference made to the condition of stasis and non-being spiritually constituting God (before the sera phic war and the revolt of Satan Lucifer and his hosts), which doth vanquish the five, but shall not preval against the Four and the Nine. The elemental equation of the fifth Angle are the Hornless Ones who in their fleshly semblance are subject to the demise of thei r objective vehicle / body. Profane humanity will experience facets of Death in consequence for their refusal to align themselves to the eternal self-sustaining essence of the ninth an gle, the Black Flame, and the terrors of the intellect. Neter element from the Fourth Angle Shub-Niggurath, is in direct conflict with universal laws which he can break via intellectual se paration from the objective universe. As the ruling Cthulhian neter, he is collateral to Se t and dictates the actions of the Ninth Angle, the Black Flame, and therefore can pass free from the Time / Space continuum and is not ruled by exterior objective phenomena. From the Seventh Angle is the ruin of symmetry and the awakening of the daemons, for the Four and the Nine shall prevail against the Six. Consultation with Dr. Michael Aquino's Diabolicon reveals the following: “Know, then, that throughout the great Cosmos there exists a sublime order, whose nature was determined in eons long past by that singular consciousness of all order which is now called by the name God. Consider well the measure of this achievement, for all that is now behavioral law was then absent, and it was the epoch of Universal chaos. Even time itself was unknown, for this Un iversal inconsistency was nowhere breached.”"},{"pageNumber":1155,"pageContent":"In this passage, Satan / Lucifer speaks of the pre-Sepharic War condition of mindless servility to the divine order or the Universal symmetry, but Satan's distinct, individual sense of mind empowered by the essence of the Black Flame bestowed upon others of his kind identify of mind and substance. From the Eighth Angle are the Masters of the Realm , who raise the temple of the eight trihedrons unto the daemons of creation, who is at once four and five and nine. From the Ninth Solstice Message: “My age has begun, and I am come forth to uphold my bond with mankind. Yet I shall not illuminate all, nor even many -- but a few. I seek the Elect, who in turn seek me. Man the god shall arise only from the ashes of man th e beast -- the blood is the life. High Priest -- You have made my name beloved. But a time approaches when I shall be shunned and cursed as never before. This matters not, for the Elect will have seen my truth. But my Church must survive, and to survive in fact, it must vanish in fiction. Out of the great darkness I have come, and into the darkness I and my Order shall again venture. Therein lies the future. Those who choose the solace of the known shall be rewarded with death.” Here our Lord, the Prince of Darkness, speaks of the gathering together of his chosen, the Elect, the true Children of Darkness, and th e highest honored among them the Masters of the Realm, charged with the sanctification, de velopment, and remanifestation of its work, credo, and the evolutionary sojourn along the path of Indulgence and the work of Anton Szandor LaVey, to the development and reco gnition of the next Magus and his work / Logos, Xeper. The sign of four, five, and nine is embodied in the power of the sigil of the Order of the Trapezoid. From the Ninth Angle is the flame of the beginning and ending of dimensions, which blazeth in the brilliance and darkness unto the glory of desire. The Statement of Leviathan, the Ninth Neter form in th e statements of the Daemons states: “Only through the obliteration of the Universe that is may man seal his mastery of the Black Flame, for only thus may he know that he is not subject to a greater Will.” Thus the infernal creative will, mind, and soul of those whom the First Form has touched is the Dark Light in the greatest manifestatio n of its Satanic Power. The master magician wields it as a razor to execute his Will for his continual Xeper. Not the path of the One with God, but recognition of oneself as a God. Bibiolography Aquino, Michael A.

This ceremony is designed to serve any or a ll of three purposes: 1) To reverse an earlier baptism within the christian arena, cancelli ng out and removing any residue that may remain from that earlier ceremony (usually) imposed on the child. In this fashion it serves very much like the Setian black mass. 2) To recognize the Black Magician that has Come into Being, one who embraces and immerses himself within the black magic. 3) To state and affirm the Black Magician's dedication to the left hand path. This ceremony is designed to be performed by a large group of people, probably within a pylon. The \"Priest\" is a senior initiate, nor mally a III°+ initiate of the Temple, but a respected senior Adept also may fill this role very well. The \"Initiate\" is the person who wishes to be baptized within our ceremony. \"Participants\" are other pylon members and Setians. These latter responsibilities should be spread throughout the participating pylon. Non-Setians may not attend. Accoutrements are those normally used within rituals, including filled chalice, wand, sword, etc. In addition, this ceremony requires containers of earth and water as indicated below. Lights suitable for reading by should be lit before or during entrance, but all other functions of opening the ceremony are perfor med below; none are performed before the start of the ceremony. Music should be started be fore the first word is spoken, if any is to be used. The Initiate is dressed so that he may be re vealed in stages. His outer layer of clothing should be a dark overcoat or jacket, dark enough to be suitable for ritual, but not obviously Satanic. Underneath this, the Initi ate should wear a simple and generic black robe or cape. Assuming the Initiate is Adept, then a white pentagram may be worn on top of this robe / cape. Under this layer is the Initiate's true ri tual robe, and the pentagram of the Initiate's Grade. The Initiate may wear any additional clothing under these layers suitable for the expected temperature. This ceremony has been written on the assumption that the Initiate is Adept.

Walpurgisnacht Working [This Working is an example of how a Setian can take a RHP feast day and concept, use astrology to incorporate the elements through planetary energies, and use herbs to set the ritual atmosphere. The format for the Working is the CRYSTAL TABLET outline.] Walpurgisnacht Working - April 30, XXV April 30 was the eve of the feast of St. Walpurga, a Roman Catholic nun of the 8th century. There are many stories about how th is legend arose, but in all of them she remained a faithful nun until her death. It wa s the legend of a miraculous oil associated with the place of her burial from wh ich strange tales and practices arose. However, traditionally the feast of Beltane ha s been celebrated by various pagan groups at this same time. The association of the two is probably coinci dental and convenient where both Christianity and paganism exist among the people of an area. This is Classification: V2 - C33.4W - 1 Author: Ruth Nielsen II° Date: April 30, XXV Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1174,"pageContent":"especially so in Europe where many customs are of uncertain origin and the blending of Christian saints with pagan myths is a cultural phenomenon. This year the night of Walpurgisnacht fell on a Monday. The new moon fell on April 24, at 10:28 pm CST. This put the moon at the beginning of the 2nd quarter the night of April 30 - May 1. The Moon moved into Leo at this time. Leo is considered a barren sign, and is of the element fire. The Sun had moved into Taurus, which is an earth sign. So the elements of fire and earth were present, astrologically. Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were also in earth signs; Mercury in Taurus, and the rest in Capricorn, so there was a preponderance of earth. Venus, Mars a nd Pluto were in the water signs of Pisces for the first two, and Scorpio for the latter. What was lacking was the element air, which was found only in the theoretical point called the Moon's North Node. I therefore decided to use an incense derived from materials associat ed with the element air for this Working, since this element was no t in evidence in the line up of planets on this date. To further incorporate the element of air for a balancing effect, which is what I desired, I added the color yellow to the setting, as a pure color so as not to associate it with any particular memory. I taped several sheets of yellow artist's tissue to my blue wall at eye level. I draped several yards of plain yellow fabric on the bed at the other side of me, so that when I faced the altar, behind which is an expanse of black curtain, all I saw in peripheral vision was yellow. I prepared for the Working by sitting comfortably for awhile and focusing on the color. For the element air I use music such as that of the flute or wood reed instruments, like a recorder or pan flute. This time I used a tape of Kitaro's \"Silk Road.\" I was striving for a sense of \"lightness,\" letting all cares \"float away,\" encased in an imaginary bubble. I felt myself opening up, especially at the top of the head. The focus was on thoughts of a positive nature that stated abilities, qualities, and what I willed for myself. This helped prepare me for ritual, by setting the atmosphere and clarifying my intent and mood. I lit some of the incense and the candles when I did this initial contemplation. When I started the actu al ritual, I rang the bell and added more incense to clearly define it as the Working. In traditional pagan celebrations, this is a time of welcoming spring. It is considered the season of the Lady, in contrast to winter (the time of the Lord). A refrain used by some in ritual is: \"Our Lord has reached the ending of his journey, To find the Lady awaiting him, with warmth and comfort. This is a time for joy and a time for sharing. The richness of the soil accepts the seed; And now is the time that seeds should be spilled. Togetherness brings joy and abundance fills the earth.\" (Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft )"},{"pageNumber":1175,"pageContent":"I would like to point out however, that not all seed is spilled optimally at this time of year. Goats breed best in fall, as do numerous other species of things. So don't let any pagans try to persuade you that this is the best time of the year to \"do it,\" unless of course you want to. My focus for this Working was on clear thinking, (the air element), and in willing some control over the ponderous effects that were go ing on in my life that I could identify as related to earth, fire and water, from an as trological viewpoint. Work issues (earth) had been overwhelming, with emotional (water) an d energy (fire) considerations taking a toll. It had been difficult to think deeply or clearly for very long. Personal and domestic matters had followed the same course. So this Working was a time for a fresh start, a resowing of intent and resolve, a sorting out of priorities based on reflection. At times of crisis, the Neter of Maat is close to me, as often the course I must take involves some unpleasant change. Invoking the goddess after the great invocation to Set helps me \"s ee\" situations and alternatives in as an objective light as I can. I ke ep uppermost the reality of my Setian identity - what do I Will, what is it that my Xeper seems to be needing. In this case the problem was a clear stagnati on in my career, with unwarranted pressures at home and at work. Whenever decisions occur to me with the clarity and strength as one did at this Working (it was to quit my job a nd look for another), then after the Working I do a tarot reading to see if the situation can be further clarified. In this Working I took the growing dissatisfaction at work and my desire for a new job, and transformed it into a firm commitment to do something about it, by sending out my resumes within the followi ng week. Within five week s I had several promising interviews, so I quit my job for a two month summer vacation while my 6 children were off school. This eased pressures on the domest ic scene in spite of a decrease in income. I then had the time to invest in preparing for a career change, as one of the interviews was for my current job, a job which couldn't be entered until late July. The ironic thing is that the job opening hadn' t been well advertised in our town, and I wouldn't have known of it if I hadn't looked th at very week. Applicants had already been interviewed from outside the area, as it wasn 't expected that anyone local was qualified, and a decision was close on two of them. If I had waited another week, I would not have had a chance. So once again I realized the importance of taking seriously the time for action that derives from a Working. This Working then combined techniques used in my RHP days with the intent and focus learned in my LHP present. I think this ap proach in taking the RHP ways and going further with it, taking the in itiative for Self-Realization, is an example of how a Setian can blend what is enjoyed from the right ha nd path while maintaining the identifying characteristic of the black magician, namely the emphasis on Self and Xeper."},{"pageNumber":1176,"pageContent":"The recipe for the incense for this Working, an incense \"to encourage Fresh Resolve and Peace of Mind for Choices Made,\" is as follows: 2 teaspoons of Lavender blossoms 2 teaspoons of crushed Fenugreek seed 3 tablespoons of Gum Benzoin powder 20 drops of Cinnamon oil 30 drops of Sandalwood oil Place the first two ingredients in a bowl or mortar, and grind well for a minute or two. Add the Benzoin, and grind another minute. Ad d the Cinnamon oil, and stir well with a small spoon (demitasse or baby spoons are perfect). Then add the Sandalwood oil and mix again. When well mixed, grind the whole mass a minute or two with a heavy object, such as a stone or the pestle for the mortar. Do not use wood though, as the oils are not able to be removed from wood. Put the complete d mixture into an airtight container until needed. Place a 1/3 teaspoon (a full pinch) on a live coal to burn. The Lavender, Fenugreek and Gu m Benzoin are associated with the element air because of their effect on the body ... they are good at clearing the head (literally). Fenugreek, besides being a spicy ingredient in such things as curry powder, is used as a cold remedy and makes a delicious tea. I opened two tea ba gs to get the amount needed in the above recipe. It is also used in a famous recipe for deworming goat s. (So if you have intestinal parasites...) Gum Benzoin is also associated with the Sun, as it is stimulating. Cinnamon is associated with the Sun, and even though it has a very warming effect on the stomach when taken internally, its fragrance is definitely a st imulating mental pick up. Sandalwood is traditionally associated with the Moon. It is an all around basic incense medium, as it has such an intensely ecstatic effect on those who smell it. It seems to either lure with an irresistible quality, or repel with a vengeance. It is the favorite for protection rituals and for realizing the most potential from a situation. Here's hoping that this example will encourage others to see the old skills of the RHP as useful tools in Working our way along the singular paths of Self lit by the black flame.

Magister Wade filled the role of European Coordinator, and was fo r the last years of his life very much my support, teacher, and guide through the wonders of the Temple, and a great inspiration in my endeavours to further the work of the Neter, Set, in the Ancient Islands of Britain. The rendition of Magister Wade's magical name, actually Parsival, is not accidental. Parsival is the name given to a figure of le gend in Germanic mythology, so beautifully portrayed in Wagner's opera of the same name. In British lore the same character is found as a member of King Arthur's esteemed company of Knights, and his place duly marked at the Round Table. In the Arthurian legend, only Percival (or to give him his correct name, Sir Percival de Gales) achieved the highest qualities of knighthood that would inspire the Age of Chivalry, and to King Edward the III of England, founding the Order of the Garter, the oldest order of knighthood in the world, and one that remains in the monarch of Britain's personal gift, without recourse to the Prim e Minister or Government of the day. Through his integrity, purity, and loyalty, only Percival was able to obtain the Holy Grail for his monarch, after many heroic deeds and tribulations. Hence, in accordance with the tradition of Ki ng Arthur and Merlin, the aspect of Magister Wade is represented in its Arthurian context, thus complimentary to the spirit of the Ritual and the traditions it is based upon.

We based this text on a previous Black Ma ss that the pylon had performed a few years earlier, and the texts in #6A and #6L. We also examined the structure of the Catholic Mass using a copy of the Standard New American Missal , the one annotated with descriptions of the parts of the Mass, includi ng phrases like \"becoming one with Christ\" and \"atoning for being born impure.\" The final form was a Setian ritual that includes the parts of the Mass that are sign ificant to the celebrants embedded within the ritual.

This projection, named after Alan Turing, is constrained to do our bidding when called. However, with the power we have given it, it can also follow its own pursuits within the net when we do not otherwise require it. The energized ice camouflages us when we enter the system. The ice appears as a valid packet of data. Which system we entered through and what it calls \"valid\" is of no consequence; the ice and the colors of the aurora can project any semblance that the system requires. The energy from the lightni ng gives our Wills the electron-quick speed needed to interact wi th the cyberworld. The \"jack-in\" icon represents a jack into a standard telephone line. The easiest access to many computers -- and thus to the cyberworld -- is through telephone lines. The telephone system itself is one of the larges t and most complex computer networks on the planet and in close orbit. The tunnel beyond the gate is one of the co mmunication paths that move data among computers. These paths include wire cables of many types, such as standard household telephone lines; fiber optic cables, where the data is moved in the form of light pulses such as our ice crystal prete nds to be; and microwaves and radio waves that connect relay stations, whether ground- or satellite-based. We used the striking imagery of fiber optic cables (bright, coexisting packets swim ming through a tunnel and being shunted by mirrors) rather than the more mundane wire cables. As more networks become connected and as more systems include different paths of connection, the links among the systems often include terminal concentrators and gateways that are, in themselves, small computers equipped with memory and special purpose CPUs. Of course, with such a large, redundant network, some links have less traffic than others -- the \"quiet cable\" wher e we do our work undisturbed. Each band in the cyberworld sky can be thought of as one of the possible communications paths.

It is a visual representation of uncollected garbage in virtual memory. As a program runs, it uses memory space. After a program completes its run, its unneeded memory becomes available for other programs to use -- if th e other program happens to need a chunk of memory of the same size (or smaller) than th e chunk available. The data sea consists of all the small chunks of memory waiting for reuse. Each small chunk retains its now- useless type of data (color in the visualization) and its shape until the small chunk is reused or combined with the memory next to it to form a larger, usable chunk. On a network, the data sea includes memory fragment s from inside systems, on disks, in the shunting and relay boxes in the links, and a thousand and one other places -- including those unprogrammed numbers on your answering machine. The grit of the beach is \"bad \" data, all those unusable spots on disks. The Sentinel fuses them together to form the ever-const ant sigil, identifier of the worm. The worm is one of the most dreaded forms of computer infestation. A worm moves from machine to machine within idle memory space. A worm can mimic and change other programs; change or read data at will; ove rhear passwords and learn to bypass security measures; and intelligently create other programs. Thus, a worm can ensure it ALWAYS has sufficient \"idle\" memory to do its work. Efforts to control or destroy a worm simply cause it to move on, hide on disk drives, spawn children, or aggressively defend itself. A properly constructed worm can live in a network, working its Will, forever.

This technique has enabled the Order of Shuti to share the Grail with all assembled Setians very quickly, each celebrant taking the Grail to one third of the Setians involved. This has proven very useful in rituals involving a large number of Setians. \"Lift the chalices\" was done with three chalices on a black-clothed tray. 2. This technique of adding powders to the grail during the ceremony was a very successful experiment. It allowed several mo re initiates to be active in the ritual. These powders must be very finely ground so they dissolve readily into the liquid. They should also each have their own color and flavor if possible. Within those guidelines, any reasonable powders may be used by Setians in performing this or similar workings. The specific substances used at Set-XIII are readily available in most markets, and were ground to powder in the Grand Master's mortar and pestle an hour before the ceremony.

Excerpts of a letter to Priest De Cecco from Priest Lewis, October 6, XIII: Sometime during the morning hours, the wee hours, of October 2nd, I was asleep and dreaming -- and suddenly became aware of the fact that I was dreaming. In my opinion the dream became a low-level astral experien ce at that point, as I could control the surroundings of the dream ... I suddenly found myself in a wooded area and ran across you. I remember being puzzled as the two of us ha ve had little contact, but we were talking over various topics (the exact subject matter escapes me) when I prevailed upon you to assist me in evoking / creating a demon form ... The thought came to me, \"DeCecco has done this before, so he'll know how better than I.\" At any rate, we began a ritual in the wooded area; just as a distinct presence was felt, as if the \"demon\" were about to materialize, you vanished and the sensed presen ce rapidly lost energy. I was left alone in the forest with only the memory of your presence and that of the thing we were about to call forth. Now, my impression on awakening was a very strong one. A small voice in my mind said, the reason DeCecco vanished so su ddenly was that because in Framingham he awakened. My question to you is if you recall any unusual dreams or experiences on the date this happened. If so, I would appreciate hearing about them ... It would give me an indication of what might have been going on. II. Excerpts of a letter to Priest Lewis from Priest DeCecco, October 24, XIII: Your \"dream\" of October 2nd is very interest ing. I will answer your last question first. For that whole week I had trouble sleeping. I would awaken in the wee hours every morning (3-4 a.m.). Your suggestion about my disappearance just as the \"Demon\" was about to materialize, coinciding with my awakening here, is probably the most accurate.

Astral Projection – A discussion of common problems and their resolution The use of astral projection in Greater Blac k Magic has many benefits. It also has some dangers. These dangers are usually not immediately harmful, but they can cause serious trouble to the Initiation and Balance of a Blac k Magician if they are not recognized and dealt with promptly. When using astral projection as a ritual tool, the Magician can experience difficulty in using this technique. The actual specifics a nd degree of each difficulty will vary from individual to individual, but each can be addressed and resolved. A common problem when trying to use astral pr ojection in G.B.M. is the simple inability to achieve a state of astral consciousness. This is not new or unusual. The actual processes involved in astral projection are comp lex, and entail no le ss than an inversion of the source of sensory stimulus. Instead of external occurrences causing stimulation, internally generated images are fed to the senses. This is a difficult thing to do. Classification: V2 - C43 - 1 Author: Adam Campbell II° Date:  January,  XXVI  Publication: The Black Sun , I.1, Infernus Pylon HTML Revision: Dec 25, 1998 CE Subject: Out of Body Projection Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1210,"pageContent":"There is a simple and effective approach to solving this problem, and that is practice. Only through regular and sustained effort can astral consciousness be attained at the Magician's Will. The Magician should explore a variety of techniques in order to find the most effective method for him or her. Ultimately, astral projection is a discipline of the psyche -- hence the need for practice. Another common problem experienced when us ing astral projection is the phenomenon of uncontrolled or random imagery forcing itself upon the Magician. This can be a serious problem if it continues unabated while the Magician uses astral projection as a part of Greater Black Magic. If this ra ndom and usually subconsciously generated imagery is not brought under control, any use of this technique can quickly turn a G.B.M. Working into a White Magic astral \"trip\". Such uncontrolled imagery can be pleasing -- indeed intoxicating -- but it must be reme mbered that a Black Magician uses astral projection as a tool , and is not used by it. This is why it is important that a Black Magician has a clear idea of what alterations he or she is going to make in his or her subjective universe. This clarity of intent will reduce random fluctuations, and will tend to s uppress subconscious intrusions. This is imperative, so that the force of the Magician's mind is not lessened by distraction or indecision. Concurrent with this is again the need for practice. Any Magician intent on using astral projection as a G.B.M. tool shou ld practice holding a particular astral image in his or her mind while practicing this technique. The Magician should also practice altering such images in controlled ways by force of Will alon e. All this leads to a strengthening of the Magician's force of mind and focus. Because of the powerful alterations in the s ubjective universe of a Black Magician using astral projection, there exists the possib ility that the clear definition between the subjective and objective universes may become indistinct or blurred. This is a serious problem, as the Black Magician's skill and Understanding is based upon very clear perceptions of the interconnection and inte rrelation of the subjec tive and objective universes (and the characteristics of each). Wi th such uncontrolled blending or a distorted perception of either one, ther e lies a serious danger to the Initiation of the Magician. This problem can be avoided or at least mini mized. Through the use of ritual, the Black Magician creates a buffer zone, a place separa te from the outside world, in short, a \"sacred space\". Not only does this sacred space have the effect of supporting any Workings occurring within it, it also serv es to define the time and place where the boundary between the subjective and objective universes be comes more fluid and more easily Linked. This is why it is important to have formalized beginnings and endings in ritual Magic. Effective ritual not only aids the assumption of astral consciousness, it also cuts any \"loose strings\" that might tangle with the thoughts and perceptions of the Magician after the Working proper is complete. This is an important factor, and should be considered when planning Greater Black Magic Workings."},{"pageNumber":1211,"pageContent":"If the use of effective ritual does not seem to have this problem under control, the Magician should seriously consider undert aking some \"grounding\" exercises. These grounding exercises will vary from individual to individual, but the common underlying purpose of these exercises is to allow the Magician to regain his or her sense and Understanding of the objective universe. This can be achieved through the use of \"hard\" objective actions and processes. Examples of this include such things as rigorous physical exercise programs, \"shocking\" physical sensations (such as ice cold showers), or even the solving of complex mathematical problems. These can be undertak en on a regular basis, and/or before or after specific Workings where complications are expected or experienced. All of these comments are not intended to discourage or scare any Adept Magician away from the use of astral projection in Greater Black Magic. It is, however, imperative that the Magician be aware of any potential problems so that they can be recognized, avoided, or solved. Astral projection is a valuable tool for any Black Magician to have, and time and effort spent to master this di scipline will be well rewarded. Magic and the Fifth Dimension Contrary to Newtonian concepts of physics, matter can become energy and energy can become matter. This theory was put forth by Albert Einstein in 1905, and has been demonstrated many times since. The most dram atic proof was in 1945, with the explosion of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. Telesmic images are also a form of energy, though energy quite different than that as most physicists would define it. If energy as we know it can become matter, then surely the same thing can happen with magical energy or, as it may also be called, telesmic imagery.

This is the world of both matter and energy. The fourth dimension is duration [in time]. What is the fifth dimension? The fifth dimension is the mind and all of consciousness, since it contains the mind of everyone -- and not only humans. It is a larger dimension than the first four, if indeed they are even capable of having any limits themselves. The fifth dimension has no limits, since it is formed by all the minds in the Universe. Events, both on a physical and on a mental level, occur in this dimension, but people are usually aware only of their own thoughts and environment. Hence most don't believe in its existence. It is possible for physical events to be create d out of this mental energy. Since the mind radiates a different kind of energy than that physicists usually measure, it also creates a different kind of matter. Gamma rays, X-rays, etc. are the types of energy force found in the first four dimensions; while hydrogen, carbon, and the other elements that make up the physical world (as we know it) are the different parts of matter. Thought, however, is the energy of the fifth di mension. The telesmic image is a fusion of the mind [or minds] into an energy force that can create matter. An advanced Setian mind can create beings in the fifth dimension. During ritual, the opening of the gates can serve as a bridge by which the Setian goes from the first four dimensions into the fifth. One of the dangers of attempts at magic by the inept, by the way, is that of dealing with the many other beings that exist in this fifth dimension. If the Setian's concentration is very strong -- and if Set is willing -- the Setian can bring Set out of the fifth dimension and into the fi rst four. This obviously requires a high level of communication between the Setian and Set hi mself. But, were it to happen, Set would be transformed into energy and/or matter. He would be with us in the first four dimensions. This has been trie d in the past with Satan, and is known as \"conjuring the Devil.\" If it doesn't work, it is usually either because the evolution of the magician was too low, or because he used \"protective devi ces\" such as magic circles, Bibles, and other distractions that built a wall between the sender and receiver of the message. Another mistake has been the commanding of beings such as Satan to appear in the name of God (a conceptual inconsistency). Proper communication with Set necessitates seeing him as a friend rather than as a servant or power with which to compete. If the Setian can recognize Set as a part of himself, then he is on the way towards effe ctive communication. It is likewise necessary to see oneself as part of him. It is this me rging that makes possible our further evolution. Xeper! "},{"pageNumber":1213,"pageContent":"Magical Behavior I am an Adept of Set; I am a Magician, learni ng the Black Arts.

Since Xeper is Willful, I am responsible for anal yzing my actions, deciding which actions are desirable, and keeping them. I must also decide which actions are undesirable, and eliminate those. Proposal : It seems natural to assume that there are three classes of behavior: rational, irrational, and magical. I have always attempted to be a fu lly rational being, and I have mostly succeeded. I need therefore to increase the amount of magical behavior that I indulge in, hopefully without reducing the rational, and certainly without increasing the irrational. Classification: V2 - C5M - 1 Author: Robert Menschel II° Date: (Unknown, probably XIV) Subject:  Behavior,  Magical  Reading List: 23"},{"pageNumber":1214,"pageContent":"To Willfully increase my Magical behavior, wi thout increasing the irrational, I have to discover the differences between these three types of behavior. I need to define Rational behavior. From it I can define the others; without it, I can not. According to the dictionary, Rational behavior is Reasoning behavior. Then Irrational behavior is behavior which is contrary to re ason, and Magical behavior is behavior which is neither in accord with, nor contrary to reason. (1) This is a pleasing definition. It explains why I need to leave my scientifically reasoning and skeptical self behind to become proficie nt at magick. It places magick outside of Reason, safe from all denials and ridicule from reasonable (but skeptical) people. Setian Magical behavior is Willful behavior. Without Will there is no Setian magick (and Setian magick is the strongest magic yet discovered). Without thought there can be no Will. Spontaneous action is Re action, not Willful action. Setian Magical behavior, Willful behavior, must be thoughtful, reasoning behavior. If the reasoning is sound, it is Rational. If the reasoning is unsound, it is Irrational. Problem : Assuming that Magical behavior is distinct from Rational and Irrational behaviors, then the dictionary inadequately defines Rational behavior. We can not define Magical behavior from it. Proposal : Let us look for another definition. I am Rational. From a description of my behavior, perhaps we can find a good descri ption of Rational, Irrational, and Magical behaviors. I am goal-directed. Is Rational behavior goal- directed? Then Irrational behavior would be that which takes us further from our goals, and Magical behavior would be that which is independent of goals. Bells ring. Magical theories throughout the ages have stated that the magician must not have goals. \"He who desires nothi ng will receive everything.\" But if you don't want anything, why perform magick? One of the more significant magical advances made by the Church of Satan was the recognition that \"The first ingredient in the performance of a ritual is desire.\" (2) I do a lust ritual because I lust. I destroy because I wish to remove a pest. I do a ritual for Xeper because I desire to Xeper. Magical be havior is very strongly goal-directed. My behavior is Scientific. Rational behavior might be that which takes logic and science (measurement, correlation, and causality) into account. Irrational be havior is that which denies scientific principles (3) , while Magical behavior, though thinking and Willful, operates outside of science."},{"pageNumber":1215,"pageContent":"I perform a ritual to cause something to happen. I perform a ritual when that ritual will be most effective (timing can be very important). During ritual I make extensive use of the magical theories of correlation. Much of what is now science used to be magick. The magick we now perform will someday be science. Already the simpler ritual methods within the Temple of Set are becoming technologies. Many modern magicians apply scientific pr inciples to the study and performance of magick. We are effectively technicians and engineers, using a science which hasn't yet been nailed down and codified as explicitly as those sciences recognized by society. (4) Problem : I have been unable to find a definition of Rational behavior for which I can find Magical behavior which is Nonrational. For every definition of Rational behavior, Magical behavior is Rational behavior (or Irrational, if followed irrationally). Proposal : Behavior can be broken into several ty pes or classes, which may be Rational, Irrational, or Nonrational. Perhaps I should atte mpt to find and define these classes. From the definitions I can determine the differences between these classes. Then I may be able to discover a class of behavior (or several classes) into which Magical behavior will fall. (5) We have already examined several sets of behavior. We have discussed Spontaneous actions (those performed without thinking first), and Thinking actions (those which follow thought). Unthinking actions include several subsets: simple reflexes (knee-kicks), automatic actions (heart pumping), learned reflexes, simp le rituals (drinking the morning coffee), etc. I will spend no time on these Unthinki ng actions now. They are not Willful, and probably therefore not Magical. I wish to explore more profitable ground first. Actions (behaviors) performed with (some) thought comprise the rest of our universe. Unthinking and Thinking actions are two sets of behavior which are mutually exclusive (have no intersection), and those whose union is the universe of all possible behavior (every behavior is one or the other). Thinking actions include actions of varying degrees of thought. Homo primitive acted mostly without thought. As he evolved into Homo sapiens he thought more and more. A qualitative advance oc curred when the human race discovered Logic, and could rigorously reason whether a thought was correct , incorrect, or not (yet) classifiable. We were then able to apply the rules of Logic to our growing store of empirical knowledge, and act Logically. Thinking behavior can be split into three mu tually exclusive subsets: Logical behavior, Illogical behavior, and Nonlogical behavior. All unthinking behaviors are Nonlogical by definition, since only Thinking behavi ors can be Logical or Illogical."},{"pageNumber":1216,"pageContent":"Are there any Nonlogical Thinking actions? Th inking behavior before the discover of Logic was necessarily Nonlogical. Behavior c ould be Logical or Illogical only when there is a Logic to compare the behavior ag ainst. Even today there are humans who are incapable of Logical thought and action. These people act Nonlogically. These three sets (Logical, Illogical, and Nonlogical) together constitute the entire universe of action. Nonlogica l actions may be split into two subsets. Unthinking nonlogical actions, as a set, is identical to the set of Unthinking actions. Thinking Nonlogical actions together with Illogica l and Logical actions, constitute the mini- universe of Thinking behavior. Homo sapiens continued evolving after th e discovery and implementation of Logic. (6) The next qualitative change in behavior was the discovery of scientific methods. Once scientific methods were define d and put to use, scientific behavior was born. We are now able to incorporate empirical data into our Logical thought processes, and know the extent of the correctness of our theories. Let us therefore define three new subsets of behavior: Scientific, Antiscientific (that which denies Scientific facts and/or philos ophy), and Nonscientific (that which does not go counter to science, but simply is not affected by science). What is the relationship between science and Logic? Science uses Logic as one of its thought processes. Scientific behavior is neces sarily Logical behavior. Scientific behavior is therefore a subset of Logical behavior. Is scientific behavior a prope r or improper subset of Logical behavior? Is there Logical behavior which is not Scientific? Logical behavior can be stated as: \"Given circumstance A, and assuming premise B, then action C is proper behavior.\" Scientific behavior requires that circumstance A and premise B be empirically proven within technological limits, before we decide that C is proper be havior. Because Scientific behavior requires empirical analysis wherever possible, while Logical behavior does not, Scientific behavior is a proper subset within Logical behavior. Scientific behavior states: \"Given situatio n A, and assuming relati on B, then C is the desired action. We have tested the situation to be best of our ability, and can state that, to the best of our technological measurements, it is A. We have tested relation B to the best of our ability, an can state that relation B em pirically holds true. Therefore, let us do C.\" Antiscientific behavior may state: \"We are at A. B is easily determinable, but let us not bother. Let us do C.\" or, \"We are at A. B is know n to be false (or is likely to be false). Let us do C anyway.\" Antiscientific behavior may therefore be Logical or Illogical. Can Antiscientific behavior be Nonlogical ? Only those actions in which Scientific thought has been utilized can be Antiscientific . This requires the a ttempted use of Logic. Therefore Antiscientific thoughts and actions can not be Nonlogical."},{"pageNumber":1217,"pageContent":"Is there Nonscientific behavior? Following the logic used before, all behavior before the development of Scientific methods was N onscientific. Those who are incapable of Scientific behavior today (because of native inability, the lack of education, or other reasons) act Nonscientifically. Many people can act Logically, but do not have the education to act Scientifically in a given situation. They therefore act Logically, and Nonscientifically. Nonscientific actions can be Logical. Following an earlier di scussion, Nonlogical actions must be Nonscientific. There are Nonlogical actions. Therefore Nonscientific actions can be Nonlogical. If a person is capa ble of Logical action, incapable of Scientific action, and that person acts Illogically, then that No nscientific action is Illogical. Therefore Nonscientific actions may be Logical, Illogical, or Nonlogical. We have defined many subsets of behavior. Scientific, Antiscientific, and Nonscientific are mutually exclusive, and together their union equals the entire universe of behavior. Scientific behavior is a proper subset of L ogical behavior, which is a proper subset of Thinking behavior. Antiscientific behavior is a set which intersects both Logical and Illogical behavior sets, but not the Nonlogical. It is therefore a proper subset of the union of Logical and Illogical behaviors. Nonscientific behavior intersects Logical and Illogical behaviors, and totally encompasses all Nonlogical behavior (Thinki ng and Unthinking) as a proper subset of Nonscientific behavior. This is getting complicated. Let me use a Venn Diagram to illustrate what we've discovered so far: In the diagram at the t op of the next page, each space (with three codes) indicates one minor subset, at the most detailed level. The codes indicate which sets the subsets are subsets of. 'T' and 'UT' indicate Thinking and Unthinking behavior, respectively. 'L', 'IL', and 'NL' indicate Logical, Illogical, and Nonlogical behavior, respectively. 'S', 'AS', and 'NS' indicate Sc ientific, Antiscientific, and Nonscientific behavior, respectively. Venn Diagram: Types of Behavior"},{"pageNumber":1218,"pageContent":"Where in this universe of behavior is Magi cal behavior? Let us define three mutually exclusive sets, whose union is identical with the universe. (This method seems to be working so far...) Let us call them Magical, Antimagical, and Nonmagical behavior. As usual, Antimagical behavior is that which denies Magical principles, while Nonmagical behavior is that which is simply unaffected by Magical principles. I stated before that Setian Magical behavior is Willful behavior. Setian Magical behavior is an evolutionary advancement of Crowleyan magick. (7) However, this does not mean that all magic must be Willful. We must consider all the currently defined sets and subsets of behavior, to determine whether they may intersect with Magical behavior."},{"pageNumber":1219,"pageContent":"Since at least some magic is Willful, and si nce Will apparently requires thought, then some magic is Thinking behavior. Is ther e Magical, Unthinking behavior? Unthinking behavior includes several subsets. Habitual behavior is Unthinking behavior which used to be Thinking behavior. If any unt hinking behavior subset can include Magical behavior, certainly this one can. (8) I am a weather worker. With a little work a nd time I can Willfully cause sunny weather. I expect eventually to develop my skill such that if I wish to barbecue a steak while it's raining, I could stop the rain for the duration of the barbecue. Eventually, such an action can become habit. Someday, when I want to barbecue a steak, the rain will stop. Such behavior will still be Ma gical. Therefore Unthi nking behavior can be Magical. But we have purposely taken the most extreme Unthinking behavior, the only subset which includes behavior that previously was Thinking behavior. Is there another Unthinking subset which can include Magical behavior? These other, lower subsets of behavior are much more difficult to analyze. Somewhere in the sea of Unthinking behavior is the \"start\" of Magical behavior, the \"lowest\" class of behavior which can be considered Magical. Is that cla ss Habitual behavior as examined above, or is it an even more primitive or basic behavior class? Several books on Astral Projection have reported instances in wh ich people in pain or trouble, or near death, have projected their spirits out of their bodies for a while, and later returned. These people apparently performed such ma gic without forethought, and sometimes even without knowing beforehand that such magic is possible. Is this Magic? In times of stress, aided by hi gh levels of adrenaline in the blood, people have been known to perform feats of strength that would otherwise be impo ssible. Are actions of astral projection as described above supernat ural, or are they simply supernormal? Astral projection and teleportation seem to be related. Let us therefore first look at teleportation. Science Fiction stories often mention teleportation machines: People step aboard a platform, push the buttons that indicate their destination (as in an elevator), and zap, they have arrived at their destination. If such be havior is Magical, then ri ding in an elevator is Magical. A traveler who uses such a teleportation machine is not performing magic; he is simply using a technological tool of his society. Let us remove the machine. Assume that a mast er magician can enter a trance, and can focus his mental energies so strongl y that he teleports his body to a desired destination. Further assume that scientists are unable to determine how the magician does this; it is scientifically impossible -- that act is Magical. Great mages of history have been reported as being in two places at once. Although their physical body did not leave the original location, th e spirit seems to have been able to form a second physical body at a destin ation point, for the duration of a visit. These mages supposedly performed physical f eats (lifting objects, etc) at th e destination of their astral projections. This is Magick. Let us follow the same great mages, as they pr oject their astral selves across the continent, this time without evocation of a physical body. Th ey again appear to friends, who can see and"},{"pageNumber":1220,"pageContent":"talk with the mages. However, the bodies that are seen are insubstantial, like ghosts. Such behavior still qualifies as very powerful magick. What if there are no witnesses to this magical feat? Assume that I want to find out what's playing at the movies, but don't have a newspaper. I might simply project my astral self in front of each movie theater and find out what 's on the marquees, without making myself visible to others. While I'm there, I'll also fi nd out how long the lines ar e, so I can determine how long I'd have to wait to get into the movie. This is still Magical behavior. Projecting one's astral self to a physical location is very difficult. (I haven't yet managed it.) It may be easier for several mages who wish to co nverse with each othe r to each project their astral selves to a mutually agreed upon imag inary (subjective) meeting place. Even though the location for such a meeting does not scientifically exist, the meeting can occur, and the mages can have their conversation. This too is magick. After a hard day at work, I sometimes feel in need of a very restful loca le. I can project myself to an imaginary park, where I know I'm the only human, surrounded by fr iendly deer, colorful birds, chipmunks. Assuming that my conscious mi nd does travel to this locale, and I rest, I have performed magick. Even powerful magicians can have accidents. A ssume that I have tripped, and fallen down the stairs, badly spraining my ankle. I have bandage d the ankle, and am soaking it, but must now stay still. My ankle hurts. One method of avoidi ng discomfort is to proj ect my conscious self away from my strained ankle to some other lo cale, such as the park above. I can stay away until the doctor arrives. This is almost the case we questioned before, in which someone's conscious self flees the unpleasant situation, projecting that conscious self to a more pleasant locale. I perform my Magical act Willfully; the ot her act is performed without forethought. Although Will is a prime ingredient in modern magick, it is not requ ired for all magic. I therefore claim that this poor person's escape is Magical. Since magic is possible at the fight / flight level of behavior, and also at the strictly Scientific level, (9) it seems that every subset of behavior that we've already investigated can include Magical behaviors. Every set of behavior can be split into subsets of Magical and Nonmagical behaviors. Application : My goal is to increase my Magical beha vior. I need to recognize my magical behavior among the many behavioral possibilities before I act. Before I perform an action, I can fairly well determine how Rational that ac t is going to be, by examining the qualities of the act. I should be able to examine an ac tion before it is performed, and determine how Magical this action is. Once I can, then I have achieved my goal. This process should be similar to the process I now go through to determine if a behavior is a) Rational, b) Logical, c) Scientific , d) desirable, e) etc. A Scien tific action has the quality of being \"based on known facts.\" Logi cal acts have a quality of be ing \"based on logically proven statements.\" Desirable acts have the quality of \"resulting in pleasure. \" Magical actions must have similarly definable qualities."},{"pageNumber":1221,"pageContent":"Will : Will is not necessary for the performance of magic. However, Willful Magic is powerful magick. Aleister Crowley defi ned, \"MAGICK is the Science a nd Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.\" He stated that, \"Every intentional act is a Magical Act.\" Every Willful act, every consciously chosen act, is a Magical act. (10) Aleister Crowley then postulat ed, \"ANY required Change may be effected by the application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the proper manner through the proper medium to the proper object.\" Once you know the necessary and sufficient physical conditions which produce an event, if you Willfully produce those conditions, the desired event will occur. There are \"predetermined\" events in our universe, and there are events determined by Willful action. \"Predetermined\" events are those whic h take place because their prerequisite conditions occurred without direct, Willful in terference, and which occur because no one Willfully stops them. Some people feel that Crowley calls almost all human behavior magical. I have learned that simply making a decision and acting upon it is no t sufficient, is not Magical. Most people make \"decisions\" every day of their lives, withou t being magicians. Their decision process is based largely on emotions or feelings. Something feels \"good\" or \"right\", or it's what they've done before. This is not a Magical, Willful decision; this is a predetermined reaction, programmed into the person by the environment. To perform Willful magick, the magician must conscientiously: 1) Determine the desired result, 2) Determine the conditions required to reach that result, 3) Examine alternative methods of producing the required conditions, 4) Choose the alternative which produces the required conditions with the least effort and with the fewest undesirable side-effects (or with the most desirable side-effects), and 5) Perform the required actio ns with such Willpower that nothing this side of the Abyss can st op the desired result from happening. Maintaining such dedication to an action (or sequence of actions) is difficult. Let the Will falter, or let the action occur simply because their is no oppositi on, and the act has lost some of its Magical quality. Therefore, one Magical quality that an act may have is Will. I can determine the amount of thought that goes into an act , the amount of planning, the amount of freedom from environmental programming, and the amount of tena city I apply to the W illful occurrence of the act. These give some measure of the Magical quality of an act. Desire : Anton Szandor LaVey (Magus of the Age of Sa tan) stated, \"The firs t ingredient in the performance of a ritual is desire, otherwis e known as motivation, temptation, or emotional persuasion. If you do not truly desi re any end result, you should not attempt to perform a working.\" (11) Much Satanic magick is based on the bod ily and emotional desires. The Lust and Destruction rituals in their high est, most advanced forms, ar e Satanic. It is Magical to Willfully Indulge in the de sires of the body and mind. It is also fairly easy for Desire to lead the W ill astray, and to cause the magician to neglect the amount of study required to choose the best actio ns to take. I must therefore temper my desires with intelligence. I must examine my em otional wishes, and determine which of these should be acted upon. Once I have Willfully chos en a course of action, I must allow my emotional desires to run their strongest. This w ill ensure that the whole of my being wants the"},{"pageNumber":1222,"pageContent":"magick to work, wants the desired event to occur, and will ensure that I keep my Will trained upon the outcome. There are some events which must occur, about which I don't feel very strongly. I may decide that a certain series of steps is necessary to attain a goal. I desi re the goal, but not some of the intervening steps. As a magician, I know that th e intervening steps are more likely to occur if I desire them also. Not only is the simple presence of desire a m easure of Magical behavior, then, but also the Willful control of desire. If an act incorporates co nsciously enhanced or squelched desire towards some goal, that act is Magical. Belief : It is commonly supposed that a human target of a magical working must believe in magic. This theory is false. Magic will wo rk upon a nonbeliever. Indeed, often magic works strongest upon a recipient who does not know that a spell has been cast, who (believer or not) has no reason to counter the magic (consciously or not). It is, however, very important fo r the magician himself to believe. While simple tasks can be performed with a doubting or sk eptical mind, more complex ma gick requires confidence on the part of the magician. The magician must believe that the magick will work. All actions benefit from confiden ce and belief. I am more likely to solve a calculus problem if I believe the solution is within my capabilities. Further, it is simp le to have confidence in an action which has often been successfully performed. A magical element enters when I am able to bo lster my own confidence, when I am confident that I can complete a Magical act, an act whic h I have not previously done, and for which I have no reason to be so confident. Yet, I must be careful; I must be balance d. I must not let my confidence exceed my capabilities by too much. I must be able to learn, to question, to Xeper. I must not let over- confidence abort my development. I can determine the amount of confidence in a working. I can determine how much of this confidence has been Willfully heightened and controlled. The heightening and control of confidence is Magical. The Unknown : Magi Crowley and LaVey, as well as curr ent leaders of the Temple of Set, all point out the similarity between science and magick. Much of today's science would have been called magick 100 years ago. Much of what is called magick today will be called science in 100 years. The Willful application of scie ntific knowledge and thought towards a willfully chosen goal is Magical. Yet, when most peopl e think of \"Magic\" they think of levitation, spells, demons, and the like. Levitation is not yet Scientif ic. Today's engineers are not yet marketing an antigravity machine. Some people think that levitation is im possible. Others feel we need to learn more about the laws of gravitation."},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"The casting of spells is not Scientific. Occult shops carry powders and incense for increasing your finances, for attracting lovers, etc. Pharm acies do not (except perhaps in the diet and cosmetics sections...). But how long will these situations continue? How long will it be before your corner drugstore carries a pill which makes people respect you? How long will it be before you walk up to a busy intersection, press the \"Push To Cross\" button, and are teleporte d across the street? Just as the ancient alchemists studied their ma gick (which has grown into the \"hard\" science of Chemistry), and just as the ancient astrologe rs studied their magick (which has grown into the \"hard\" science of Astronomy), so should th e magician of today study the sciences of tomorrow. He should endeavor to study and use the sciences of tomorrow, becoming technician, engineer, and theoretician. All occult studies and actions can be Magical, can lead towards a science of tomorrow, can use an (as yet) undiscovered law of today's scie nce. These studies must be followed carefully, or like Marie Curie we may get burne d; but they should be followed. Note that Suprascientific behavi or is not Antiscientific behavi or. The magician must always recognize current Scientific law. Our freedom fr om science lies only in our investigation of the loopholes in today's laws, in the refinement s of today's laws which science has not yet discovered, and in our activities in realms not yet covered by today's science. We can not ignore scientific laws; we can onl y explore their incompleteness. It is easier to use current science than it is to use future science. The magician determines which sciences, which technologies, which magics to use to attain each goal. He should not use \"magick\" (the science of tomorrow) simply because it's magic. However, he should be willing and able to use this science of tomorrow to the best of his capability when needed to attain his goal. And yes, using tomorrow's sciences can be more \"magical\" then using today's sciences. It feels \"different\" to be using techniques that are not yet sanctioned by the American Academy of Sciences. It feels \"different \" to be casting a spell, calli ng upon demons to do our bidding. We feel powerful when we do so. Another Magical quality that can be measured, therefore, is the amount of \"unknown\" or \"occult\" behavior that is delv ed into. We must be careful not to ignore the currently \"acceptable\" methods of attaining our goals, but we should always recognize that the Suprascientific means are also sa tisfactory, and that they are impor tant to our magical sense of being. All magicians must perform magic. It is well and good to Willfully decide upon your goals and to Willfully execute your decisions. But you will not feel Magical unless you enter the magical sphere, where you tread alone among the unknown. Philosophy : All great magicks have centered around a Philosophy. Wiccan magic centers around their religion, the dualism of Male and Fe male, of Heaven and Earth. Christian magic centers around Jesus Christ, his orig ins, his message, and his death."},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"Modern magical systems also center around philo sophies. The magic of the O.T.O. centers around the philosophy of Thelema. The magic of the Church of Satan centers around their philosophy of Indulgence. The magic of the Temp le of Set centers around the philosophies of Xeper and Xem. An act is more magical when it is performe d in line with a philo sophy. The philosophy may be individually followed, or may be followed with a group. However, an act followed towards a goal, which also leads towards a philosophy, wi ll be a stronger Magical act than the same act followed only towards a mundane goal. Conclusion All acts can be analyzed for their Magical and Nonmagical qualities. (12) Acts may have Nonmagical qualities of being based on Logi cal and Scientific thought. Acts may have Magical qualities of being Willfully executed, of conforming to desire, of enhancing a philosophy, etc. I can analyze any action for thes e Magical and Nonmagical qual ities. I can then mold my behavior, increasing the amount of Magical behavior I indulge i n, while maintaining the basic rational balance that is so important to a functioning being. Footnotes 1. Not all Nonrational behavior needs to be Magical. However, by the above assumption, all Magical actions are Nonrational. Given that th is assumption is true, I will later need to examine the question of Nonrational behavior vs Magical behavior in more detail. 2. The Satanic Bible 3. eg: Creationism 4. I am using the word \"science\" to mean the study of relationships which have fixed, observable laws. Physics is a science in wh ich we have made great advances, have observed many such relationships, and disc overed many physical laws (scientifically determined relationships which we believe always hold true). Our observations in the science of Psychology are less complete. Our ob servations in those fi ends called \"occult\" are still quite primitive. We have discovered few solid relationships, and few (if any) laws. The relationships and laws are th ere; we just have to find them. 5. I find myself defining sets of behavior, and subsets.

The creature is alive through the superstitions and folklore of many a country, and like his kin the werewolf, the vampire may have a basis in mundane fact. The magical f oundation is quite anot her thing, so let us look initially at history and at a medical condition that will shed a certain amount of light on one of the most compelling and fascinating inhabitants of the night. From France we get the familiar word \"vampire,\" and Germany has provided vampyr . From the Serbian we have vampir , and these, plus variations from other countries, all point to the same thing: the presence of a non-natural be ing possessed of a strang e and frightening life where none should be. The generally accepted de finition of the vampire is that of a reanimated corpse ready and able to leave its grave, usually during the night hours, to batten on blood. Immunologists would find themselves at wits' end with the undead: few beyond Andy Warhol have allowed their vampir es to become ill from ingestion. We know, from looking at this world and the data available regarding the universe, that life is not the norm. The norm is the non-living mechan ical physical science of the consistent cosmos.

This can be seen in the ancient land of our first Temple where everyt hing was assigned a deity. Alt hough religion undeniably had an important place in the life of Egyptians, as Bu rns and Ralph point out in World Civilizations , it would be an exaggeration to consider the Egyp tians as ultra-religious. It was often simply easier to assign beings and functions than to contemplate life's many facets in a civilization where today's sophistication did not exist. In other words, there had to be a determining cause behind each action of the universe, and when a living being ceased to function as such, man's sense of the unnatural took over. That the dead should lie still was accepted and hoped for. That he should not do so was feared; it was, after all, the living for whom the Earth must have been intended, and to the dead belonged the lands of the shadow. To find th at which had been assigned to the depths of the Earth walking was then and now an unsettling thought. More than a sufficient number of stories of catalepsy abound in literat ure. Some are true, some fiction, but all are based on a grain of tr uth from the past. Certai nly narcolepsy produces strange symptoms, and while cataleptics are usually seen these days only under medical circumstances, the disease continues to be found. The condition is not a new one. I have observed a catatonic under psychi atric care stay statue-like fo r hours, only to explode into violent action later when disturbed. I think this could serve as an illustration of what may have occurred now and then in the past, in stories of alleged vampires rising from coffins to maim and kill those meddling with their bodies. I th ink it possible a number of cases of vampirism could easily have been narcolepsy and/or ca tatonia/catalepsy augmented by rank superstition. It is not now nor has it ever been looked upon as \"good\" to be different from the teeming masses, be it mentally or physically. There is a strong psychological cas e for the vampire. The creature 's attractiveness is the basis for many a fantasy and pleasurable dream.

Many another cinematic vampire, male and female, portrayed the same command to look, regardless of whether its source is horrifying in the manner of Max Schreck, humorous in the way Y vonne DeCarlo beautifully did her parts, or mysterious in the style of some of the outstanding presentations of Carmilla have been shown.] As Montague Summers wrote, \"It is cu rious to note that the ancient ideas of the physiognomy of amorous persons is not at all unlike the distinctive marks of the vampire.\" There is an eroticism which pe rvades encounters with the u ndead, and many a wistful person has hoped for the gratification which stems fr om the vampire's unique kiss. Again quoting from Montague Summers' The Vampire, His Kith and Kin , \"It has long since been recognized by medico-psychologists that there exists a definite connexion [s ic] between the fascination of blood and sexual excitation.\" Imagery is a powerfu l tool in anyone's hands; it is particularly potent when used by those most in need of a de sired object. The weightless feeling that comes of physical fulfillment's peak is closely akin to the idea of the vampire's caresses - thanks to novels and films on the subject. Fully in comman d, it is the vampire who is the leading figure of the stories we encounter. The figure may be compellingly sensual or, like Varney, the Vampyre [1847 ce], it may be a tragic and driven soul. Whichever, he usually offers an ecstasy not often availa ble and therefore of the most desired kind. While there is a certain missing element of th e rare and forbidden which is corrected by a vampire's visit, it should not be thought th at only the sex-starved yearn for them. Those terrified by the thought of death may find themse lves driven to a desperate search for the"},{"pageNumber":1227,"pageContent":"undead. After all, the reasoning behind the search is that the vampire may have died once, but then arose and mastered death. He is pale, but not pallid like the risen Christ of story. The choice would be between an eternal life in Heaven where nothing is familiar, or an eternal life on the old and well-known Earth. Those who have an abiding fear of death and its unknown lands would be more likely to c hoose the latter. There is, as Eric Hoffer has written an entire book on, an ordeal about change, and in the case of the death-fearing, th e change into being unencumbered by a body might seem the greater and more terrifying of evils. It would be an error to say the vampire has no real existence fo r those frantic to find him and partake of his gift: desperation and imagery go hand in hand to create an often unrea listic goal. It is the Magician who understands the proper combinati on of reality and desire through his journey into the world of knowledge, a la Plato's Cave allegory. That the blood is the life is an integral link of the vampire with immortality. The belief has very ancient roots to it, through Le viticus 17, 10 through 17, 11 in the Bible . In those passages Jehovah lets it be known that he becomes particularly irate at those who partake of blood. The passage goes as follows: “And if anyone, whether of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing among them, partakes of any blood, I will set myself against that one who partakes of blood and will cut him off from among his people. Since the life of a living body is in its blood, I have made you put it on the altar, so that atonement may thereby be made for your own lives, because it is in the blood, as the seat of life, that makes atonement.” Leviticus is a text written not for the masses, but for the priests of Jehovah, and designed to cover ritual in daily life. Not only did it provide strict codes for everythi ng from food to sex to housing, but further it added the backing of divine and unquestionable authority behind the priesthood. Pointing out that blood was sacred as the vehicle of life painted it as a gift directly from God and therefore sacrosan ct. In the light of Jehovah's threats, it took a being of considerable power to partake of blood with impunity. And yet lif e is life, and the instinct for self preservation is stronger than Biblical edict. Along with having life, blood has power. An illustra tion of that belief is found in the Odyssey in which Ulysses slaughters a sheep to attract the spirit of the dead Tiresias. The departed who flocked to the pit of blood were described by Homer as \"strengthless dead,\" crowding about seeking the vital energy of th e red liquid. Homer understood the association of blood and life when telling the Odyssey , and the vampiric dead of his day have survived in literature until our own. Homer's deceased have not been the only drin kers of energy through the centuries. Also associated with a sexual element, the incubus and succubus sought that vital element in living fluids. Although generally thought of as deal ing primarily in semen, these highly erotic creatures were now and then spoken of as bl ood drinkers, with a family tree going back to Lilith. This lady, who taught Adam the ropes and left him for dead, was the personification of every aspect of the female vampire: she was sa id to be beautiful beyond words, powerful, and associated with the royalty of Hell. The traditions of Lilith and her descendants have made for man a dark and splendid fascin ation lasting for millennia. Many a tale has come down over the years a bout the physical appear ance of vampires. Red plays a part, naturally enough, in the signs and symptoms of vampirism. [Even ancient Egyptians saw red as having evil connotations, and held that Set himSelf had red hair. Red headed men were therefore evil by association. Se t is of course one of the very few deities portrayed as red in color, and it would be interesting, although probably impossible, to dig far"},{"pageNumber":1228,"pageContent":"enough back into history to see where the idea of Set and the color red became linked. But I digress.] The disease porphyria is not a ne w one, and it is conceivable th at a number of those suffering from it in the past have more or less unwillin gly contributed to the legends found in volume upon volume to this day. Porphyria is a metabolic disease whic h has several classifications with somewhat differing symptoms. Found among them are those of abdominal pain, central nervous system disturbances, difficulty in eating, and weakness of the muscles of the abdomen, diaphragm, and chest. These can lead to a reduction of respiration and eventually to death in some cases. The patient with porphyria can be sensitiv e to light and in some cases experience changes in pigmentation of the skin where strong and steady light hits, and there are cases on record of a photos ensitivity to the point of b lister formation on exposure to sunlight. Just on the basis of t hose symptoms alone, compare them with a less than up-to-date knowledge than our present one, and what you fi nd will be suggestive of the presence of a vampire. The decreased respiratory rate and th e central nervous system effects combined can bring about a state of coma, which an untrain ed person of some hundred or so years back would have difficulty distinguishing from deat h. And then to have the supposedly dead individual make a change, begin to breathe, and look about, and you can easily imagine the effect on the bystanders of an earlier age. Other symptoms of porphyria are psychological alterations. Pe rsonality changes, hysteria, confusion, and psychoses have all been documente d. Compare these also with descriptions of some of the vampire cases of history, and ag ain we can suspect porphyria rather than the undead. To offer further support for this altern ate possibility, one of the most striking symptoms occurring in some classifications of porphyria is that of erythrodontia. In this condition the teeth are stained gr ossly red or brown, and the body is frequently feverish. The one unfortunate enough to have this may al so exhibit hemolytic anemia, a disorder characterized by the short life of the red blood ce lls, thereby needing blo od infusions to regain a good physiological balance. The anemia itself can be hereditary. [Ever read legends of vampirism running in families?] More than sensitivity to sunlight, more than comatose states, more than any other thing, we associate a mouth red-stained with the vampire. Take combinations of erythrodontia, confused st ates, lethargy, coma, anemia, and personality changes, and then place them amid a largel y uneducated and supers titious society, and you may well have happened on the basis for more than one tale of the undead. The medical cannot be the only etiology to account for all the cases of vampirism recorded, but I feel they may account for a certain number. But just as one begins to feel that reports of the undead are na ught but old wives' tales, some old wife is sure to be found dead, bloodl ess, and punctured with wounds suggestive of \"animal bites.\" Charles Fort, in Wild Talents , deals with several susp icious cases in which porphyria cannot be worked in as an explana tion. The instances related in Wild Talents of course are not current ones, the most recent one related there being in the 1930's, but the October, XIX issue of Omni ran a brief column entitled Real Vampires and dealt with three researched cases of vampirism reported in the South African Medical Journal . The two psychiatrists who made the reports were carefu l to deny the presence of any supernatural aspects, and go further to say th at cases of vampirism are rare. This last is good news in itself since, there are enough senseless killings in so ciety without epidemics of vampiric fatalities catching on."},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"As a creature of pure magic, the vampire rema ins a resident of long standing in the living darkness of the occult. His ability to live long af ter he should have ceased to be is a hallmark of the immortal, and as such another of his magical aspects is evident. The prolongation and preservation of the physical body is more or le ss wishful thinking and an expression of an aversion to the aging of tissue and eventual deat h. What lives and surviv es is, as Magus Anton LaVey wrote, \"... your spirit - your immortal spirit...\" This is the part that Wills to continue experiencing life and living. An alert and awake mind will ha ve realized long before the bi ological end that, as the Spell for Life Unbounded by Time says, \"Death is but the doorway to new life.

We also have the Black Flame of Set added to our intelligences, and are as invincible as we choose to be.

The documentation of specific instances was certainly not up to today's exacting standards, but nonetheless, reported cases remain in vari ous texts along the way. Herodotus, the Greek historian whose name appears in a number of writings, himself wrote of the Neuri, who change \"once a year into the form of a wolf \" for several days. This account, from the 5th century B.C.E., is one of a number that can be encountered. [Disclaimers were popular in that century, too: Herodotus reporte d the story, but let it be known that he personally did not believe it.] The first century of the common er a saw satire exploiting the werewolf legends, and in the second century some Roman doctors noted that lycanthropy was a mental disease and recommended venous phlebotomy as a prime treatment. The examples can go on and on. But what does a Setian magician see in lycant hropy? Let's look at a few different reasons for the legend of the werewolf. There is a grain of truth in mo st tales handed down over the aeons , and there are indications in that of the werewolf, also. For example, Gould and Pyle's exhaustive Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine is one of the texts that examin es an interesting medical condition known as hypertrichosis. In this condition, a c ongenital one, the individual is born generally either covered with hair or with a more than usual amount of it. As time passes, the abnormal hirsutism increases, and the bearer of the c ondition is marked by varying degrees of hair presence. Gould and Pyle quote another source, saying, “Bichat (Paris, 1812 C.E.) informs us that he saw at Pari s an unfortunate man who from his birth was afflicted with a hairy covering of his face like that of a wild boar, and he adds that the stories which were current among the vulgar of individuals with a boar's head, wolf's h ead, etc., undoubtedly referred to cases in which the face was covered to a greater or less degree with hair. ” Having seen photographs of individuals with hyp ertrichosis, I can well agree with Bichat's conclusions on the origins of some stories. While few of us would have seen an actual case of hypertrichosis, a closely related medical condition is that of bearded women, a thing not at all infrequent. And in these days of easy access to over-the-counter depilatories, who can say but that someone with the same medical problem th at helped bring about tales of werewolves might not be a next door neighbor? Aside from medical conditions, there are social considerations that could and did lend credence to the werewolf legend. Another popula r and long-lived story, generally dating from the 1600's, is that of the villag ers (probably armed with torche s, yes) who pursue and capture a wretch who of course confe sses to cannibalism, but only becau se he periodically becomes a werewolf. The word \"wretch\" is used because the wolfman is usually described as having symptoms of malnutrition and a lack of personal hygiene, not to mention a somewhat confused mental state. The reason he is captured is that he would have committed a number of rather careless murders along the way in meal planning. Most versions recount that he was sentenced not to death but to imprisonment in a monastery, thereby in dicating that his judges had a glimmering of the differences betw een black magic and delusions. Although his confession was in accord with the popular notion of what a werewolf was, he was fortunate in that thought and not hysteria helped set his sentencing. This pariah, or one of the real versions of him, served an important purpose, that being to differentiate between a werewolf and a lycanth rope. Mind now, there is a difference. The lycanthrope suffers from a ment al aberration in which he belie ves himself to be a wolf; a werewolf lives generally in folklore as one tu rned physically into a wolf. The former, needless to say, is more common."},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"With magic, all things are possi ble, and therefore it is now to lycanthropy we turn our gaze. Lycanthropy, again, is a condition of the mind. Such a state of thought processes is not unfamiliar to Setians, the difference being that magicians control the new perspective if utilizing it in their magic. It be comes, if so used, a ritual prep aration, and the aspect normally seen is changed to whatever the magician has fo rmulated. It is important to point out that the lycanthropic transformation does not eradicate or overpower the other parts of being and awareness. These remain present, and control of the perspective can be returned to normal at will. I suspect that a number of cases of alleged possession in those performing occult rites result from a lack of awareness of the operator' s options. It is extremely easy to get so caught up in a ritual work that the normal awarene ss and perspective is blanketed by the newly accessed state of being. This has happened to a ll of us now and again for varying periods of time in ritual settings, but it generally does not last, and it in fact should not be permitted to overshadow the awareness of othe r equally important matters. [I n other words, you don't want to get so caught up in ritual th at you discover a candle has fallen only when the altar is ablaze. A somewhat similar thing was the state of mind of the old Norse Berserker: the frenzy of these warriors, whether chemically or self-indu ced, was of such depth as to not allow the infliction of wounds to register on the mind. The Berserker had one thought in mind: fight and kill.] If lycanthropy is chosen as a magical working fo rmat, the less civilized parts of the being are allowed a greater play. Like the ferocity of angered dragons and enraged lions, the lycanthropic transformation opens the door to a world of power unhinde red by hesitancy or compunction. It is a highly useful method of wo rking involving destruction and power rituals. Along with being useful, it is also highly effec tive. The Setian has the upper hand in magical manipulation, because he takes the time to judge and discriminate people and circumstances; therefore, if a destruction ritual is done, the object of it usually deserves exactly what he gets, and what he gets is the unleas hing of a force made all the gr eater by the foresight and self- order of the operator. Take the time to obj ectively look at the overall workings of a destruction ritual in this cont ext, and you will find a logical sequence that can lead only to potent results. The man-animal within us can find lycanth ropy to be of immense and deep personal satisfaction. We no doubt still harbor within our genetic codings the memories of swift runnings and savage joys at catching and killi ng prey. The mental imag ery of watching forest and jungle settings flash by, a nd the evoked odors of the chase and hot blood, can bring out the older being within and cause the muscles to tense with racial memories. If this much can be done through armchair imagery, imagine the eff ects of full ritual procedures with such an outcome in mind. There are certain changes that can come about in the physical being as a result of the impact of ritual, particularly group ritual, and these have been not ed by more than one individual present at the time. They can come about a resu lt of a combination of the heightened insights and perceptions of both the group and particular persons involved, and fear not, have never left bloody fragments on the chamber floors. Howe ver, these are the re sult of particularly strong magic and magical circumstances, and should not be expected to be seen each time the Gate of the Pentagram is opened. If seen, thes e transformations should be considered in the proper perspective and not be pe rmitted to overpower the analy tical thought processes. In other words, always keep both feet, or at l east one, firmly on the ground. That way you will not be tempted to become lost in the mazes of the unsubstantial."},{"pageNumber":1232,"pageContent":"Are there werewolves among us? None that I pe rsonally know.

Freedom ... is prior to the world and has its origin in the primal void. God is all-powerfu l in relation to nothingness and to freedom. And that is why evil exists.\" - Alan Harrington, The Immortalist Love, like evil, cries for immortality and for timelessness in a time-filled world. Beyond good and evil, what lies ahead may be the path to immortality, but what are the tools to arrive at immortality's gates? Love? Evil? Love is an evil, when it serves only self-interest and shares itse lf with the evil of another, the evil being the need to escape/avoid the hungry pangs of time and temptation for pleasure's sake. Evil is a love when it seeks freedom apart from dependence, and when it seeks to destroy time and those responsible for it. Love is an exercise in immort ality. In the romantic stages of a relationship, this can be seen when lovers are locked in a divine state wishing time itself to stop. Evil is an exercise in immortality, in that it is a fight against slavery to dependence, and it would much rather remain an \"evil\" than a mocked \"good\" that does nothing at all. If you are ever loved, you must be evil, because it is evil of you to even think/feel you could stop/control time with your love! Maybe you we ren't trying to accomplish this, but you did anyway! -- and you are guilty of a crime that n early everyone is involved in -- fighting death. The quest for love is a fight ag ainst death, and to be \"evil\" is to become independent of the Great Law. When love and evil meet there is pain: a pa in of passion and agony. Why? Because pain is endurance in keeping timelessness alive within l ove. As immortality nears, death draws near. Why? Death also seeks immortality, just as life seeks immortality. The balance will not change merely because we wish it to be so. One seeks what the other has. Evil is not man against himself, it is man against death which he ascribes to himself. Evil is the quest for more time. Love is a state of divinity seeking refuge from time. Immortality is the cry that utters forth a final hope in the face of death. The Aeon of Set is an aeon of survival in the fa ce of death. But what are the tools with which survival is possible? -- which we struggle to s eek out and cultivate within ourselves?

From the moment of her inception into the corp oral form, we have sens ed an innate pot ential for that which is known as the Black Magic. In rare in stances, she herself has realized the substance of the Gift. At times she has sought us out, but always in co nventional (and therefore unacceptable) fashion. During these magical attempts at, shall we say, trying to \"speak\" to us , she has ut ilized the corrupt, Hebrew symbol that encompasses the decadent goat. In ages past did we answer such calls, but this is a new Aeon; no longe r shall we accept that bastard title. We have allowed a measurement of your time for the pu rification, and now that time is past. Our symbol is once again pure. So, wh ile attempts of the young one to reach us have thus far failed, certain conditions will be brought about by her own Wi ll that can lead to initial contact with one of our Order on earth. It is regrettable, how ever, that she finds it necessary to go forward with a danger ous experiment firs t, before she arri ves at Truth. Averne, as she is known to you, is about to execute a working of what we know as white magic. This working shall be the catalyst that will create two subsequent directions or fates. One of those fates will be the fu ture that Averne will today destine herself to follow. Dependent entirely upon her Will and streng th, she will either lead herself towards \"discovering\" our earthly Temple , or she will become a terrified victim of her own fears and be driven mad in the most hideous manner. This latter fate -- by far the more likely -- would result in malignant, lingering horrors that have yet to be imagined by the minds of men. It is this awesome fate that awaits the young one if sh e succumbs to her fea rs. In orde r to avoid this terrible fate, to succeed, she must conquer her Will. And so, we anxiously observe the young one as she pr epares for what she perceives to be a working of Black Magic. Her fate, whether renewed life or mental death, rests in balance. * * * * Averne glanced nervously at what was assemb led in her bedroom. She closed the door and switched out the lights, save for a small van ity lamp near her working area. The time had arrived to survey her working tools. She sighe d a breath, and walked ove r to her Altar. Using the list contained in her Ritual Text, she began to check off each device or accouterment to be utilized in her Ritual. First, of course, was the table she was using as an Altar. For that she had draped her old school desk in black cloth, and then placed it against the west wall of the bedroom. Placed upon the Altar in an orderly fashion were the basic devices necessary for such a working. Her Workbook lay in the center and at the front of the Altar. A Wand, cut from living birch, was to the left of the Workbook. An Athame, with her name written on the hilt in witch runes, lay to the right of the Workbook. A Thurible, whic h contained a suitable conjuration incense, was situated at the far left-hand corner of the table. At the far right-hand corner sat a large cow bell. It had been refinished in gold paint, and would act as an an ti-pollutionary device. On the front left-hand corner lay a 9\" by 9\" sheet of blank, commercial parchment. Upon it would be written the name of the Demon summone d forth, and also an appropriate sigil. To the right of the Athame rested her Pen of Art. It had been used to write the Ritual Text, and Subject:  Xeper  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1248,"pageContent":"would be employed to fill out the parchment. The only other device actually on the Altar was one large, white candle. It was directly be hind her open Workbook, and once lit it would serve as the only source of il lumination in the room. Having checked off all the items on the Altar, she le ft that immediate area to survey the rest of her chamber. Of critical importance to this magical operati on were the two different circles drawn on the floor. Having previously shoved he r furniture into the far corner s of the room, an atrium of sorts was formed for her actual working area. Di rectly in front of the Altar, and traced in chalk on the floor, was her triple Circle of Protection. Traced to the most precise area possible, based on the measurement of her Ci ngulum, it would serve two important purposes. While standing in it, she would be protected from any malefic forces , and secondly it would concentrate her Magical energies. As she be nt down to recheck that circle, her hand automatically felt at her chest, and she felt s ecure in the knowledge that she was wearing a Pentacle for protection. Thus she was doubly safe. Finally, three feet off to the le ft of the large circle was anot her circle drawn on the hardwood floor. Actually, it was a circle within a circle . She bent down and went over the ancient signs contained therein in minute detail. Inside the most internal circ le was a Pentacle. It was not unlike the one she was wearing. This smaller ci rcle would contain the parchment once it had been fully charged with the Demon's name and sigil. The smaller circle played a part of extreme importance in the Ritual, as it would contain any entit y that answered her conjuration. Everything being check ed and in readiness, she stood up and tried to think if any possibilities had been overlooked. Although her parents were not expected back home until the early morning, Averne rushed downstairs to make sure all the doors were lock ed. Once back in her own room, she shut her door for the last time before the Ritual would begin. She wa s afraid. Not having performed this type of ritual before, she did not know what to expect. Not knowing causes anxiety. And fear. Now inside the Circle of Protection, Averne li t the candle and the incense. Reaching over to switch off the small lamp, she hesitated momentarily. One final glance of the room as it was. She turned out the light and closed her eyes. Her imagination spoke to her of the magical current that ebbed and flowed in the atmos phere. How badly she had wanted this time to come, in which she would conjure up the Devil. And as she dwelled on that thought, doubts made th eir way to her conscious self. She began to feel that she could not justify this daring operation of magic. She searched her soul, yet she could not come up with any important questions to ask of the Dark Lord. The intensity of her fears magnified and took on shape. She now doubt ed if simply a circle containing symbols was enough to hold the Devil, or any demon for that matter. And direct ion and purpose were being lost to apprehensive conjecture. At the very time when she should have been firm, she was not. Her concentration was being interrupted. She opened her eyes and tried to focus on famili ar objects in the room , but nothing appeared the same. Objects were hazy or distorted due to the smoke from the incense and insufficient light. Sensing that she was not really ready for it, Averne th ought (for a moment) of not"},{"pageNumber":1249,"pageContent":"continuing the working, But she did not stop. Instead, she began reading from the text. Mechanically, she rang the bell and recite d the few, necessary opening lines. Averne had reached the first crit ical stage of the Ritual. She ha d to charge, with the name of Satan, that blank piece of parchment. If she waited too long to do this , she would destroy the continuity of the working. She had to act now, one way or the other. She was not at all equal to the demands of the Ritual. Visible signs of stress made themselves evident. Her breathing became erratic, and she was perspiring openly. As ominous, foreboding thoughts played havoc on her psyc he, she continued on with the working. Grasping the wand in her left hand, she pointed it at the smaller circle , and then directly downwards at the Circle of Protection. Holdi ng it aloft with both hands, she pronounced the name of Satan. Letting her wand simply fall to the floor, she picked up her Pen of Art. Upon the parchment she wrote the name of Satan, and also put thereon the si gil of the Devil. She then held the parchment above the candle, and spoke as best she could, the magic formula: \"Creature of paper, thou art Satan. I name thee Satan.\" She shook so violently, that she almost fell while picking up her wand again. Having done so, she used it to trace an imaginary Pentacle over the parchment, three times in succession. Once more, and then a third time did she repeat the formula: \"Creature of paper, thou art Satan. I name thee Satan.\" At this point, when she was feeble and at her own mercy, something other than her own consciousness compelled her to continue. A power or force, seemingly alien to herself, began manipulating her actions, her movements. Someth ing not yet visible bega n to push and pull at her senses. Averne fought to regain control. Yes! She had done it! Averne had successfully cr eated some entity that would no longer allow her the choice of whether to go on or to quit. In robot-like fashion, she circumambulated her Ci rcle of Protection, and returned to face her Altar. Bizarre conditions prevailed, and the conj uration that she had written in English was now being recited by her in Enochian. That done , she picked up the parchment from the Altar and placed it in the smaller circle. As panic bega n to take hold, her self-created creature grew ever stronger. She could do only wh at it told her to. Forced to he r knees, she was \"directed\" to face the smaller circle wherein lay the parchm ent. Her body went very rigid, as if in a cataleptic fit. Her gaze was transfixed by the parchment. Something was forming in the small circle. The parchment appeared to be breathing. It flexed itself as if inhaling and exhaling. And Averne fancied to herself that she heard th e hissing sounds of its breathing. After what seemed to be minutes of this phenomenon, the \"living\" parchment took in one, long breath and stopped. It was ... holding its breath. Seve ral seconds later it exha led once more with a raspy and terrible noise. Then, it began to rise off the floor! It floated a few inches above the surface, or seem ed to, and then it pla ced itself in an upright, vertical position. It was facing Averne now, a nd looked rather like a sm all television screen. This was too much for the young one, and she managed to turn her head away for an instant."},{"pageNumber":1250,"pageContent":"But just as quickly it was jerked back to be hold even more abnormalities. A metamorphosis of sorts was taking place. The white color or hue of the paper seemed to drain away through one corner of the parchment. What it looked like after that was a small pane of clear gl ass, with words still written on it. (The words, in fact, were the sigi l). Then the words themselves sort of congealed into a black puddle and the puddle drained itse lf from the image. Vague colors became visible, and Averne thought she detected horrid aromas sifting through the air. The colors then seemed to begin shaping them selves. Shocking contours and features formed on/in that floating pane of glass. Formed fr om the deepest recesses of Averne's mind, an image became clearer and more defined on the sc reen. Finally, one fearful shape came into complete focus, and undulated in that two-di mensional world. Averne's image of the Devil had emerged, and it hungrily eyed the te rrified girl in the outside world. This lurker from the darkness \"talked\" to Averne . It demanded to be let loose of its prison. It howled at her and commanded her to release it into the world of three dimensions. And she knew that if she allowed it to be manifested fu lly, it would seek to destroy her. All depended on her remaining Will. In the midst of such chaos, Averne's mind struggled to maintain that last piece of order that was left. Only too well did she sense what would happen if she subjugated herself entirely to her raging fears. She had to summon what ofttimes is the hardest commodity to find ... courage. With near-lightning speed she hoisted herself up to her feet. But, alas, it was a wasted effort. The creature was making her approach the sm aller circle. Each tortuous step brought her closer to the outside limit of he r Circle of Protection. She trie d very hard to resist. Then, something dangerous happened. Her bare foot ste pped outside of the protective circle. With a supreme effort she managed to drag it back in ... but not before the mani festation got to her. That one moment of agony seemed suspended in time and space. Pain pulsed right up her leg and through her body. It was most fortunate that Averne had fa llen back into her circle. Because the shock and pain had earned her sa lvation. Part of her thoughts and her Will had been freed. She instantly perceived how she might break loose of the Demon. Every last portion of her depleted energy would be needed. And she would have to act with the utmost of speed. Everything was in the Ritual proce dure. She remembered. It had to be done. Propping herself up on an elbow, Averne literally threw herself at the Altar. She arched her back and shoulders up as high as possible, and reached for her Ritual Text. In the dim, smokey haze, she strained her eyes to read the pa ssage that would force the demon to leave. In barely audible intonations, she spoke the License to Depart. Her creature struck back and her throat b ecame constricted to the point of blocking her breathing. But she hung on in desperation. The image was moving viol ently within its confines. It broke loose for but a second, and then materialized into three dimensions. But the License to Depart had taken its toll, and the phantasm could not retain that form. It was receding into the abyss of imag ination from whence it came. Even as it faded, it threatened to return to her consciousness once more. It shrank and withered, but Averne's fears were still much in evidence ... so it did not disappear. It so tormented Averne, that she knew she had to do one final thing to dest roy its grip. She once"},{"pageNumber":1251,"pageContent":"again raised herself up to her feet. Tossing aside the Ritual Te xt, she knew instinctively what had to be done. Grasping her Athame with both hands, she boldly lunged at the thing in the parchment. She left the knife lodged in the paper. The fight was over. She had won out over hersel f, her fears. She kneeled over the smaller circle, and allowed strength to seep back into her body. Severa l minutes later, instead of leaving the scene altogether, she did somethi ng that -- to her -- seem ed quite unexpected. Averne rose to her feet and approached the Altar. She exti nguished the candle, and allowed her eyes to adjust to the darkness. Desire bu rned through her system. A nagging want or need to know overcame her fears. Just what she sought out could not be explained. She had a sincere desire to reach out to the Prince of Darkness. And a sensation of warmth overcame her. She longed to know what the Truth was. She sensed a Being or entity that did have Knowledge. In darkness. She listened ever so carefully and felt Gift ed ... in a way. And a soon-to-be initiate crawled out of th e chaos to meet her challenge. Supplementary note concerning Averne's Search: In writing this story, I had orig inally intended it to be a statement on a specific Temple of Set concern -- that of making potenti al Setians aware of th e fact that there is a Temple. The story does deal with that issue in a way, but if it has accomplished any purpose it goes further than the original idea. In its final form (the one you have just read), it spea ks of a struggle to overcome misconceptions in order to arrive at a semblance of Truth. Although the nature of Averne's struggle is mostly Magical, I feel I can safely say that most of us have at one time or another gone through trials and tribulations of vari ous sorts, in order to further refine ourselves, to grow ... to Xeper. And for some of us, I'm sure, along the line we have managed to create various \"monsters\" of our own. Whether the monsters we created were based on real, physical and/or emotional events, or even if they came directly from the id, I think that in seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and overcoming our problems, we have in essence done what Averne has done in her struggle. Once we ha ve done the very large part of the struggle and recognized the fears for what they are, then more than half the battle is won. Having originally thought that this story might have been suitable to be published in an outside, occult-based type of publication, it now appears that it is meant more for Setians already in the Temple. Aside from any grammatical errors and my partic ular style of writing here, I hope this story has sh ed a ray of darkness in this oft-times too light world.

Here I made an important decision about which way to go; I chose the \"left hand path.\" Travelling down this path I came to a primitive altar dedicated to Erzulie. The loa entered in, and I was ridden by this raging spirit that released me from an anger that I had held within me for years. Background This article is the result of my resear ch into Voudoun, incorporating rituals of a religious/ceremonial and magical nature. There are many male gods within their tradition, but the feminine is recognized by one goddess who has many aspects. The Goddess Erzulie is the Loa of love; she is the wealth iest of the Loa, the most extravagant, and desires perfection in all things . She has another aspect, and that is one of rage and despair. These emotions can be very powerful forces and often are experi enced strongly within women's lives. Her rage and despair comes from the knowledge that one makes an effort to achieve certain things in life, but often will allo w other forces (be they from within or outside ourselves) to prevent us from reaching our goals ; she expects her devotee s to attain them. Voudoun belongs to the peasant soci eties of Africa and Haiti. So me of the forms that were used as powerful symbols in Voudoun were objects of our own heritage. Baron Samedi wears white gloves top hat and tails, carries a walki ng cane, and shoots a pi stol. Why? The masters of the black slaves were the English men who ruled over the plantations; this dress was a Classification: V4 - C9V - 1 Author: Carmel Hind II° Date:   May,   XXV   Subject:   Voudoun   Reading List: 3R"},{"pageNumber":1253,"pageContent":"symbol of status and power. We can see that th e Baron wore the dress of the white master as a sign of power; by taking on this form they drew power unto themselves. I see the changes that I and others have ma de to these rites of Voudoun as creative and positive contributions to a more primitive form of Magic. We had taken the techniques utilized in Voudoun, and applied th ese practices to our own manne r of thinking and direction. Preparation For The Rites: Ritualists performing as the H oungan or priest, Mambo if a female, design a Veve. The Veve is a symbol which represents the chosen Loa. The Houngan erects an altar on which is placed a light source, offerings to the spirits such as food, rum, or cigars. Drum or asson are used, as is a bowl of flour with which to draw the Veve creating the ritual space. Those taking part in the rite may use body paint, jewelry, or other ornamentation, and may wear white or other colours in keeping with the spirit of the r ite. Those attending will have a fetish prepared, along with a request and offering with which to entice the particular Loa they wish to call upon for favours. The fetish is used as a ritual tool within the ri te. Materials used need only to be simple, grass, wood, seeds, a bottle, coloured fabric, stones, pa int, etc. With this material one makes an object to either house a spirit or to symbolize a spirit. The fetish is used ritually to either contain an unwanted energy and is destroyed once it is capture d, or to empower with energy and reuse when the need arises. The Veve is drawn on the ground, and used as a gateway for the power of the Loa to enter into our realm of existence. The Ge Rouge Altar: I used leopard-print cl oth, since the leopard was a symbol of the magician and was a sign of power. I used six ma tches, tapers, and sticks , six being the number of the beast. Fruit loaf represented the flesh and food for th e Loa. Rum was used to renew and attract the spirits. A Cigar, whic h is also a delight to the Loa, symbolized Fire, an active force of passion and one which is all-consuming. Th e incense used was of cedar, red gum, and heavy rose to appeal to the feminine energi es. I designed and hung a banner incorporating the Ge Rouge Veve. The colour red symbolized desi re and rage, black represented death and the base for things to manifest out of, gold wa s extravagance and the ri chness of life, copper added a conductive element, and white defined a nd coloured the spirit. The Veve included the designs of a heart symbolizing the centre, love, and life, and also cross formations representing the cross roads, c hoices, and direction in ones life. A pitchfork was used as an element of control to threaten and prod certa in forces. The dagger, weapon, symbol of protection and power over life a nd death, completed the altar. All items taken and passed from the altar are done so with the Left hand. This signifies that the Mambo is in fact the embodime nt of the Loa and its energy. The Baron Samedi Rite (An example of incorporating the religious and ceremonial aspects of Voudoun) The tribe danced up to the Hunfor, along a can dle lit path. Two Houngan priests grab the participants one by one, and take them to the entrance. There stand the gatekeepers, who bar"},{"pageNumber":1254,"pageContent":"the entrance with crossed swords, and cry \"Papa Legba, Papa Legba, open the gate for us, that we may return.\" They raise the swords, and the initiate is dragged in backwards. Initiation: A man with a skeleton painted face, top hat, gl oved hands, and tails blows white powder into each initiate's face as they are thrown back in to a coffin veve/image marked on the floor. They are splashed with water and a cigar puffe d over the body, then they are raised from the dead and dance to the rhythm s of Africa till all have underg one the ordeal. Once all have entered a Mass takes place. The Mass: There is a procession: two flag bearers, th e gate keepers, Baron Samedi and the other Houngans bow to the cross quarter s, then to the drummers, and then the Centre post of the cross roads. There the Baron pours water, which r uns from the central po st to represent three rivers, Birth, Life and Death. Then he consecr ates the bread and rum; all partake of the sacrament. The Cross Roads: There are four cross quarters, and each altar is dedicated to a different Loa: Erzulie, Goddess of Love; Baron Samedi, Loa of death; Damballah, Loa of fertility; and Erzulie Ge Rouge, Loa of rage. The people have their own desire for be ing there, and are drawn to whatever quarter most serves their need (the invoked Loa in this se nse represents the spirit of their desire). The Loa invoked, the rituals begin. Ge Rouge Rite: (This is an example of the ritual side of Voudoun) Erzulie was invoked on Saturns eve. I conjured the power to transcend. To accomplish this, I used rage as a force to cause the death of a part of the self preventing me from achieving my will. Others felt they were being influenced negatively by another, and aimed to sever the link. I had six matches with which to light six tapers on the alta r, I scattered the straw on the ground, and with a bowl of flour drew a veve and consecrated it with perfume to invoke Erzulie Ge Rouge. The incense is lit, \"may this scent in the air please you.\" Fruit bread is broken and a piece lifted to the hanging Veve of Erzu lie, \"there is food here to f ill you.\" Rum is poured out into a wine glass,\"a glass of rum awaits to warm you. Honour us Erzulie, and descend into the temple that we have prepared.\" A cauldron is aflame, and I pick up the asson and dance to Erzulie calling, \"Erzulie rene w our rage, let your blood pour down upon us; we stain our bodies red.\" A bowl of red liquid is passed ar ound, and we paint our faces and bodies. \"We burn our enemies in the fire and watch them turn to ash, and scatter that of which once was, 'til nothing more remains.\" We sit in a circle: th e bread is passed, \"we eat the flesh of those now dead.\" A bottle of rum is passed, \"drink the blood of the living.\" Each person now makes their offering to Erzulie."},{"pageNumber":1255,"pageContent":"\"Remember a time when you felt angry, because something was preventing you from becoming what you desired to be; let that anger reveal itself.\" This anger is danced out. The Mambo gives each person a stick; they dance, scream, and stab at the flames, using the fetish as a symbol of the preventing force it is thro wn into the fire and watched as it burns away. Others use their fetish as a w eapon and use it in a symbolic dance to destroy that which they believe prevents them.

Temple of Set Bylaws Reference Introduction The bylaws of the Temple of Set helps define and limit the Temple's or ganizational structure and activities. They provide a minimal set of standards we op erate by, and they provide rules and policies for the smooth tr ansfer of responsibilities from officer to officer. There is much that the bylaws do not specify -- the Temple of Set is inherently and necessarily flexible and malleable -- most of our activities, st andards, perceptions, etc., are subject to both individual and organizational Xeper, and therefore we do not codify those aspects of the Temple in fixed bylaws. We try to keep our bylaws to a minimum. We try to keep our minimal bylaws simple and readily understandable. Even so, there are questions raised about the bylaws, what they mean, how they're applied. This document attempts to answer those questions. Table of Contents • Introduction • Table of Contents • Bylaws and the Temple of Set o The Hierarchy of Rules • What Should Be in the Bylaws?

The unive rse of rules includes sometimes conflicting rules, which need to be resolved according to a hierarchy -- which rules take precedence over which others. The hierarch y given here may not be complete, but it covers most sets of rules we need to be aware of when thinking about bylaws: Ethics and Maat All rules written down are limited and dangerous . The misapplication of rules can lead to great evil. Each person is responsible for weighi ng their actions and their heart against Maat's feather, and for doing what is Right and Nece ssary even if agains t all known rules. This is not an easy decision, even when a n ecessary decision. To follow through with doing what's Right and Necessary often means st anding tall and proud, demonstrating your principles for all to see, and explaining th em to people who may not understand, while being jeered and attacked for doing so. Life and th e world is not fair, and those who do what is Right and Necessary often suffer for it. The onl y thing worse than taking such a path is not taking such a path, there by supporting injustice. State Law All organizational rules are subj ect to laws imposed by the stat e, including criminal law and civil law. Incorporated in California, the Temple of Set is primarily subject to the laws of the"},{"pageNumber":1272,"pageContent":"USA and of California. Other laws also apply from time to time. For instance, the Temple and its representatives are not permitted to act in violation of Germany's laws in Germany, though identical actions may be legal in the USA. Articles of Incorporation The Articles of Incorporation define the corpor ation. Our status as a corporation depends on these. They therefore take precedence over all other rules within the organization. Bylaws Subject to the above rules, bylaws are the primary rules which enable and limit the organization. They limit what the organization can do. They also empower and limit the officers and members. They provi de protections against the abus e of power, and they provide methods of retribution fo r the abuse of power. High Priest Policies The High Priest is empowered by Bylaws sectio n 5.01 to define policies, rules, followed within the Temple of Set. Order- and Pylon-Specific Rules Grand Masters may establish rules which apply to their Order, and Sentinels may establish rules which apply to their Pylon. These pow ers are granted by bylaws sections 10.02 and 11.02. Parliamentary Procedures Developed from British parliamentary trad ition, and updated by common conventions as society modernized, there are several standards of parliamentary procedure commonly used in modern organizations to cover procedural ma tters not specified by bylaws. These govern how meetings which make organizational decisi ons are called, and how these meetings are managed. These principles are rarely required in Temple activities, since so little is decided by vote in formal meetings, but rather decided by individuals. The most important role that parliamentary procedures play in Temple activ ity is during Priesthood meetings which discuss and vote upon bylaws amendments. However, ma ny of our almost formal discussions are inspired by the principles of fairness and prot ection of the minority which are cornerstones of parliamentary procedures. What Should Be in the Bylaws? Given the bylaws' place in the above hierarchy, and the complexity of changing the bylaws (it requires a 3/4 affirmative vote of the entire Priesthood), the bylaws should contain: • rules which are critical to the organiza tion's operation, such as the succession of officers and their basic duties."},{"pageNumber":1273,"pageContent":"• rules which protect the organization and its members from the abuse of power, such as the ability of the High Priest to expel members of the Priesthood who abuse their power, and protections against abuse of this power by the High Priest. • rules which are permanently necessary fo r the organization, and which should be reasonably stable for decades or genera tions, such as Recognition criteria and procedures. • rules which apply to the bylaws themselves , such as rules con cerning interpretation and amendment. Anything else, rules which are subject to change, rules which apply within subgroups, procedures chosen to implement the rules, et c., should normally not be in the bylaws. They should be determined by other means, and impl emented/documented outside of the bylaws. Bylaws Amendments Identifying the Need fo r Bylaws Amendments The need for bylaws revision can be identifie d by anyone (Priest, Adept, Setian, and even nonmember), at any time. Bylaws revisions ca n be required because of several conditions: 1. The bylaws don't cover a condition which coul d leave the organization in uncertain straits. Example: The Bylaws used to state that checks required two signatures, of the High Priest, Treasurer, and/or E.D. While Dr. Aquino was High Priest and Magistra Aquino treasurer, an auto accident could easily have left us with just one officer able to sign checks. We therefore added the Chai rman of the Council of Nine as a fourth valid signature. 2. The organizational structure changes, and su ch changes warrant Bylaws revisions. An example would be the addition of secti ons dealing with Orders and Pylons. 3. Unexpected problems are encountered or di scovered which warrant bylaws revision to resolve or prevent. Example: during the Set -IV crisis we discov ered that the bylaws provisions involving the removal of a Councillo r were too restrictive -- two errant Councillors were sufficient to prevent the removal of either one. The bylaws were therefore modified to reduce the removal confirmation requ irement by one. (7/9 of the Council is sufficient to remove a Counc illor, instead of requiring 8/9). 4. The membership structure changes. An exam ple is the addition of sections dealing with the VI°. It is almost never advisable to modify bylaw s while in the midst of a problem that needs resolution. During such times, people tend to fo cus on immediate needs and benefits, and not on the long-term needs of the organization, the larger picture. All t oo often bylaws changes made in such situations are poorly written a nd incomplete. They ofte n lead to additional problems later, unless the bylaws are agai n revised during more reflective times. The exception to that would be during a problem which has continued for an extended period of time, and which has been proven to be unres olvable without bylaws modifications. In such cases the bylaws should be revisi ted some months after the probl em is resolved, and examined to identify necessary improve ments in the amendments."},{"pageNumber":1274,"pageContent":"Proposing Amendments Amendments can be proposed by three sources: • The High Priest may propose bylaws changes at any time. He may (and usually does) discuss such changes with selected Initiates, but this isn't necessary. • The High Priest may appoint a committee of members to review the bylaws and submit amendments if any seem warranted. • Any individual may recommend changes. The easiest course of action is to offer your ideas to the High Priest, who can advance the amendment if he agrees with it. Likewise, if there's an active committee re viewing the bylaws, suggestions can be given to them. Finally, any member can offe r his proposal directly to the Priesthood. Discussion and Refinement Bylaws and their amendments are long-term d ecisions, difficult to change. It's therefore important to offer bylaws amendments which are the best possible, the most likely to do the necessary job, and worded in such ways as to produce as little confus ion or uncertainty as possible. Bylaws and their amendments need to be worded so the need for future amendments improving on them is minimized. In other words, bylaws and amendments shoul d be discussed among those with knowledge of the process before they are formally submitted to the Priesthood for approval. This serves several purposes: • During the discussion the amendment can be refi ned to a) cover more situations, b) be clearer, c) better answer the need which requires such amendment. • During the discussion other related bylaws can be reviewed and perhaps corresponding or parallel change s can be made to keep or improve the consistency of our bylaws. • During the discussion the High Priest and othe rs can take the time to review and agree with the proposal, speeding the remaining processes. Submission to Priesthood After the proposed amendment has been disc ussed, reviewed, and possibly improved upon, it needs to be submitted to the Priesthood for approval. The High Priest may submit any amendment to the Priesthood at his discretion. The easiest way to put an amendment before the Priesthood is therefore to work with the High Priest such that he agrees to do this. If the High Priest appointed a committee to revi ew the Bylaws and suggest amendments, then the High Priest will review the committee' s recommendations and may choose to submit any/all of the proposed amen dments to the Priesthood. Alternately, an amendment may be submitted to the Priesthood if requested by a petition signed by 1/3 of the active Priesthood. To obtain th is 1/3, you can either circulate the petition at Conclaves or other meetings, or mail copies of the petition to Priests, and have them return signed copies."},{"pageNumber":1275,"pageContent":"The Executive Director will be responsible fo r verifying the 1/3 count. This may involve contacting those Priests and ve rifying their support. If you have the Priests supporting your amendment send notice of this s upport directly to the E.D. as well as to you, you can speed this process. Voting on Amendments Votes on bylaws amendments may be taken in person or by mail. Votes are managed by the Executive Director, High Priest, and Chairman of the Council. Votes can be taken or begun at Conclave, if de sired by these three. If 3/4 or more of the Priesthood is at Conclave, and if 3/4 or more of the Prie sthood votes in favor of the amendment at that Conclave, then the amendment passes. If the vote is taken at Conclave and it does not gain a 3/4 majority (perhaps because 3/4 of the Priesthood was not at the Conclave), but the 3/4 ma jority can be reached if all absent Priests voted for the amendment, then this vote may be extended into a maili ng to those Priests if desired by the amendment's sponsor. Following parliamentary procedures, a vote at Conclave must be taken in a formal III°+ meeting with adequate notice. \"Adequate notice\" means that the meeting must have been on the Conclave's agenda, or announced at least 24 hours in advance at a meeting on the agenda at which the Priesthood is expected to attend (eg: a III°+ meeting or general membership meeting). The vote may be taken by secret ball ot, show of hands, or any other means which allows the ED, HP, and CC9 to accurately tally the votes and which ensures that each Priest has one vote. Votes by mail can be held by a combination of pos tal mail and email. Because of the vagaries of email, any email notice and/or vote s hould be backed up by a postal mail copy if no confirmation is quickly received. ie: If Priest A doesn't vote or confirm receipt of an email notice in a day or two of the emailing, then a ha rd copy notice should be mailed to Priest A. If Priest A votes by email and does not receive conf irmation of the vote in a day or two of the mailing, Priest A should mail a hard copy vote. Th e actual contents and methods of notice and vote will be determined by the HP, ED, and CC9. Enactment of Amendments Most bylaws amendments are enacted (come into force) immediately upon their approval by the Priesthood, or more accurately when the vote has been counted and verified. Bylaws amendments which should have a future effectiv e date (perhaps to coordinate with other changes) need to have such scheduling written into the bylaws amendment. Enforcement and Violations The High Priest stated one of the primary fact ors of bylaws enforcement in an email which discussed the creati on this document: Rules should be harsh, but the place for Me rcy and Justice should always remain."},{"pageNumber":1276,"pageContent":"The purposes of the Bylaws are to strengthen the Temple as an organization, to enable it to do its Work, and to protect it from hazard and in trigue. To provide that protection, the Bylaws must be strict, and we must be prepared to follow the letter of the Bylaws when necessary. However, if we overreact to an innocent violat ion of bylaws, we can worsen the Temple's situations rather than improve them. The High Pr iest also said, \"Mercy is the right of those who rule, not the right of thos e who are seeking rulership.\" To this I would add, \"Mercy and Justice are Balanced when the final results are better for everyone concerned.\" Standard Procedures The Bylaws specify certain procedures which must be followed by the Temple of Set. These fall into two categories: those determined by ca lendar dates, and those determined by events. I'm not going to try to list all such procedur es, just those which ar e most common and/or critical. Items can be added to this list on request. Calendar-driven • Membership fees must be paid yearly, or membership will be terminated. Membership fees are determined by the High Priest, confirmed by Council. • One Council term of office ends each June 30. The appointment of the new term of office is normally complete by that time. This appointment is by the Chairman, confirmed by the Council. • The Chairman's term of office ends on Augus t 31 of each year. The appointment of the new term of office is normally complete by th at time. This appointment is by the High Priest, confirmed by Council. Event-driven • Recognitions: The procedures for all II°+ Recognitions take place when the person responsible for Recognition dete rmines that it is time. • Expulsions: The procedures for expelling III°+ members take place when the High Priest determines it is necessary. • Officer Appointments: The Chairman appoint s a new High Priest, Executive Director, or Treasurer whenever that position become s vacant. Note that these officers serve indefinite terms of office (no fixed period of time). Identifying Violations Any member of the Temple of Set may identify and report a violation of these bylaws. It's probably best to bring it to the attention of the person in violati on first, since that's the best person to reverse/fix the violati on. Any member may also bring a violation to th e attention of any officer responsible for that area of activ ity (eg: membership problems to the Executive Director), or to the High Priest or any Councillor. Resolving Violations Decisions and actions made which are in violatio n of the Bylaws will be reversed to the best of our ability. Decisions and actions which ar e required at specific times which were not accomplished will be taken as quickly as possible."},{"pageNumber":1277,"pageContent":"Any member of the Temple of Set who feels that a Bylaws violation is not dealt with properly or sufficiently may bring this to the atten tion of the High Priest or any Councillor. Bylaws Interpretations and Notes [Note: These interpretations and notes are Magi ster Menschel's persona l interpretations based on experience and discussions with High Priest Dr. Aquino, and more recently High Priest Don Webb, unless otherwise specified. Only th ose interpretations here which indicate specifically that they are a High Priest's interpretation carry th e official weight of section 13.01. (There are none at this time.)] Article 1 -- Offices Because the Temple of Set, Inc. is a corporation chartered within California, we maintain the principle business office (where the State of California can re ach us) within California, and specifically in San Francisco. So far this ha s been the case even dur ing the period when no officer of the Temple was located in or around San Francisco. This is probably the easiest bylaw to change, but as long as we provide a re liable method for the State to reach us through such an office, it's one which doesn't need to be changed. Article 2 -- Affiliation Section 2.01: Corporate Affiliation The corporation is not to affiliate with a ny other institution, organi zation, corporation, or whatever. That means no corporate membership s in organizations like AMER, councils of churches, charitable organizati ons, or the like. However members can belong to organizations without limit, except as covered by later sections in this article. Sections 2.02 and 2.03: Dual memberships Section 2.02 disallows dual membership in othe r religious organizations for members at the II° level or above. 2.03 disallows dual membership in other initiatory or ganizations if such membership is determined to be in conflict w ith or take precedence over Temple membership, as determined by members of the Magistry. Though an \"except for Setians I°\" isn't mentioned for the latter, in pract ice there's generally some leeway for Setians to join the Temple a nd later choose between th e two organizations if such choice is necessary. The general principle which has been applied to this area is that people who want to determine if the Temple of Set is the right organization for them shouldn't have to \"burn their bridges\" to find out. Ther e are a few organizations which are in extreme conflict such that members of those organizatio ns would not be allowed to join the Temple, but they are very few and far between. The High Priest determines which organizations are considered to be \"primarily religious organization or institutions.\" In practical matters, it's normally the III° Priests that make these determinations, sometimes in consultation with Masters of the Temple. The High Priest is the final arbiter here, but is rare ly called upon for his edict."},{"pageNumber":1278,"pageContent":"The bylaws provide for no limit on dual membership in organizations which are non-religious and non-initiatory. However, there are organi zations which are counterindicated due to various reasons, including (but not limited to) a) extreme philosophical differences, b) open antagonism expressed by the other organization ag ainst the Temple of Se t, c) illegal activity or the condoning of same. Such determinati ons are not encoded in the bylaws, but are determined by the Priesthood generally, and the High Priest in particular, on a case by case basis. (The determining factor for these latter a ffiliations isn't the affiliation itself, but rather what that affiliation says about the individual and whether that individual is indeed Setian, given that affiliation.) Magistra Hardy offers definitions for ke y terms of these sections, such as: \"initiatory organization or institution \": an organization having initiation as its primary and explicit focus. By initiation we might mean: (a) expansion of the individual's capabilities, specifically with regard to limits of the psyche rather than limits and properties of other kinds; (b) enhancement of the individual's state of being \"religious organization or institution \": an organization having religion as its primary and explicit focus. By religion we might mean: (a) a supra-rational belief system; (b) practices and moral conduct prescribed by that belief system Even so, the bylaws do not entirely track our \"common sense\" about multiple affiliations. Magistra Hardy made up a list of responses that might logically be given to a I° or II° based on sections 2.02 and 2.03 plus the definitions above. A. Would the bylaws prevent me from working for a Catholic hospital? No. Religion is not the primary and explicit focus of a Catholic hospital. Nor does employment as doctor, nurse, clerk, or janitor at a Ca tholic hospital imply anything about your religion. B. Would the bylaws prevent me from taking cl asses in Ifa divinati on taught by a Yoruba cultural center? No. This is initiatory (lea rning a magical technique). Religion is not the primary and explicit focus. C. Would the bylaws prevent me from joining th e Arab Cultural Center to study Arabic? No. Religion is not the prim ary and explicit focus. D. Would the bylaws prevent me from joining th e Arab Cultural Center to study Islam? No. Religion is not the primary and exp licit focus. One may study a religion, even under a teacher who belongs to that reli gion, even as a member of a cultural organization where everyone else is a member of that reli gion, without affiliation or membership in the religion itself. E. Would the bylaws prevent me fr om being initiated into Santeria? Yes. Santeria is primarily and explicitly a religion. In addition, the cerem ony appears to involve acts and principles contrary to Setian ethics. F. Would the bylaws prevent me from joini ng the Freemasons? No. Religion is not the primary and explicit focus of the Freema sons. Although they require belief in a supreme being -- a suprarational premise -- a nd base their ethical principles on this belief, as explained by one Freemason writi ng on USENET, Freemasonry is generally pursued as a fraternal activity, not a religion. G. Would the bylaws prevent me from joining the OTO? No. Religion is not the primary, explicit focus of the OTO. The OTO describes itself as a fraternal, initiatory, social and educational organization of a religious nature, and describes that religion as"},{"pageNumber":1279,"pageContent":"Thelema. However, the degree system of the OTO is primarily and explicitly initiatory. The OTO has a specifically religious arm, the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, whose members performs ordinations, baptisms, confirmations, weddings and the Gnostic Mass. The EGC appears to be primarily a nd explicitly a relig ious institution. The bylaws probably bars II°+ Setians from affiliating with the EGC (and hence accepting any OTO degree beyond the 6th, as the OTO grants automatic EGC \"bishop\" status with the 7th degree) unless the High Priest determines otherwise. [The Onyx Tablet presently includes a paper on de termining the nature of OTO affiliation in a Setian I° and recommendations. Priests are encouraged to review that paper whenever appropriate.] H. Would the bylaws bar me from attending Catholic Mass? No. The bylaws prohibit membership and/or affiliation, not participation. [A Priest of Set III° might reasonably inquire why one would want to, accepting \"My uncle's funeral\" or \"My friend's wedding\" as valid and criticizing other answer s. But attendance of itself could not be cited as a violation of 2.02 unless there wa s a question of ethics raised by this participation.] I. Would the bylaws prevent me from joining a Christian evangelical group in order to write a paper for my degree in Religi ous Studies? Yes. The bylaws prohibit membership and/or affiliation. As implied by Magistra Hardy's discussion and examples above, members' have quite a bit more freedom to belong to nonreligious organi zations than most peopl e realize, given the reputation of this bylaws section. Article 3 -- Membership Section 3.02: the I° This section discusses the 2-year time limit to the II°. Note that while only the High Priest may grant any extension past the 2.5 year mark, such extensions have been mostly automatic when requested by a III°+ Priest. This is due in large part to the care taken by the Priesthood in requesting such extensions (and the few extensions requested in this way). It is due in large part to the Adepti who have shown themselves able to Become and Be Adept with the additional time granted by these extensions. While many sections of the bylaws specify that written notice must be sent to the Executive Director, that language is missing from this section. Policy and administration requires, however, that any Priest who adm its a Setian I° to the Temple or who grants an extension to the 2-year time limit notify the E.D. in writing so that the membership roster can be correctly maintained. Such written notice (and other no tices specified in the bylaws) can be sent by email to the Executive Director, but it's the responsibility of the Priest sending the message to ensure the E.D. received it, per our new bylaw section 13.04."},{"pageNumber":1280,"pageContent":"Section 3.02 discusses the 2-ye ar \"maximum\" time limit. Neither 3.02 nor 3.03 describe any minimum time limit. It is possible for some very exceptional initiates to be Recognized to the II° very quickly, but it's very rare. The great majority of II° Recognitions have always taken at least nine months to a year, and the average tim e members spend within the I° is growing. As the Aeon progresses, the Priesthood sees an ever-i ncreasing level of quality within the II°, and it is requiring more from those initiates it Recogn izes as Adept. We expect most members will require at least a full year to achieve the II °. We are seriously c onsidering modifying the bylaws to allow more time for achieving the II°, since in a few years we expect more and more initiates will require more than the two years currently permitted by the bylaws. Section 3.06: The V° Note that the Recognition of a Magus or Maga is the only organizational action which requires a unanimous confirmation by all members of the Council of Nine. This signifies the importance of such Recognition. Section 3.08: Downgrade and Expulsion of I° and II° members Though it is not stated here, the one-year time limit for automa tic expulsion of someone who returns to the I° and doesn't r eattain the II° can be extended by the High Priest when requested by a Priest of Set III°+. Also, any III°+ member of the Priesthood ma y choose to appeal any section 3.08 downgrade or expulsion to the Council of Nine, thr ough any Councillor. The Ch airman of the Council may choose to consider the appeal or not, depe nding on the information given to him. If the Chairman submits the appeal to the Council, the downgrade or expulsion is reversed if five of the nine voting Councillors grant the appeal. This is a natural extensi on of the confirmation process stated in sections 3.09 through 3.12. Section 3.13: Honorary Setians To quote Priest John Youril, An Honorary Member is -- in the very highest sense -- a friend of the Temple and one who has made enduring contributi ons to these sacred halls. Honorary recognitions are given to those nonmem bers who have contributed greatly to the Temple of Set, such as the lawyer that help ed establish the Temple as a nonprofit California corporation, and to members who have contribut ed more than usual to the Temple and who need to leave active membership (such as a f ounding Councillor or past Executive Director). Section 3.15: Roster \"The names and addresses of all members of the Temple of Set shall be made available to any III°+ member upon demand.\" More than that, the membership list is supplied to the Priesthood of Set whenever feasible. Those w ith PGP email capabilit ies receive a secure, encrypted copy regularly. Copies are supplied to the Priesthood at almost every International Conclave held in the U.S.A. A copy will be mailed to any Priest that requests it."},{"pageNumber":1281,"pageContent":"Section 3.20: Readmission \"Readmission of any former member of the Temple of Set who was not involuntarily dismissed from the Temple for misconduct shall be at the discretion of any III°+ member of the Temple.\" However, the Priesthood in ge neral does not see any value to people who repeatedly join and leave and rejoin the Te mple. There are good reasons why someone might leave the Temple once, and la ter rejoin. Having done so, leav ing the Temple a second time demonstrates a pattern of inconsistency which continued past two peri ods of activity within the Temple. Priests will give careful consideratio n to those who have left and want to rejoin, and most who seriously seek readmission will be welcomed back into the Temple. But it will be very, very rare that someone who has resi gned twice from the Temple will be readmitted again. Note that although the determining factor in sections 3.20 and 3.21 is whether the former member left voluntarily or wa s dismissed for misconduct, more practically the Priesthood generally will not readmit so meone who left voluntarily rather than be expelled. Those who left the Temple of Set voluntarily due to their misconduct, or who caused problems for the Temple or its members before or after leav ing, will generally not be readmitted without careful consideration by the High Priest. There is nothing in sections 3.20 or 3.21 which i ndicates at which degree levels people may rejoin the Temple. In the past we've had people leave the Temple and then rejoin at all degree levels I° through IV°. However, the Priesthood is more and more adopting an opinion that readmissions will in the future almost always be at the I° and II° levels. Those who left at higher degree levels will shortly be reRecognized to those degree levels if warranted, but they will generally rejoin the Temple as I° and II° Setians. Article 4 -- Council of Nine Section 4.02: Council Composition The Council of Nine consists of nine persons (after all, who would accept a \"Council of Nine\" with fourteen people on it?). In addition to these nine persons, th e High Priest and the Executive Director are ex-officio members of the Council, serving without vote. Voting members of the Council of Nine are sp ecified and limited by this section of the bylaws. Two non-voting members are also specif ied, but there is no specific limitation on non-voting members here. Therefore, following parliamentary traditions (as modified to follow the guidelines of the bylaws), the Chairman of the Council of Nine may appoint and remove other non-voting participants as he chooses. The appointment of non-voting participants must be approved in writing by at least five other voting members of the Council. The Chairman may remove any of these additio nal non-voting participants as he sees fit, without requiring confirmation. To date such non-voting Co uncil participation has been extended only once, to Dr. Aquino following his resignation as High Priest and the appointment of Magus Webb to that position. Note that the traditional/parliamentary meani ng of \"ex officio\" members of a committee or board is a) members who are granted that memb ership not because of election or appointment, but because of an office held (such as the Hi gh Priest and Executive Director), and b) these members normally have the same voting rights and powers as all other members of the board"},{"pageNumber":1282,"pageContent":"or committee. Though the ex officio members of the Temple's Board of Directors have full rights of participation in all discussion s and mailings, only the Nine may vote. Section 4.04: C9 Vacancies This section (replaced December, 2000) provides for the filling of a vacancy on the Council of Nine, and defines those conditions whic h qualify as \"vacancies\" to be filled. Priestess Kawaguchi once requested that we add a definition of \"incapacity,\" which is reasonable, but in my opinion that definition does not belong in the bylaws. The Chairman should be responsible for determining which types of conditions are an incapacity which requires removal of a Councillor (or any officer), and the Coun cil has the res ponsibility of agreeing or disagreeing with him (since a ny such removal requires confirmation by the Council). Examples of such incapacities would include me dical or physical problems which prevent the Councillor from attending to his duties. (An ex ample of the latter woul d be if a travelling Councillor were kidnapped and held by terrorists in some foreign country.) Also, if a Councillor should take actions which demonstrate the Councillor's inability to serve following the high standards we require, that too would be considered evidence of an incapacity. Amendment history: In our bylaws as original ly adopted, Councillors were appointed by the High Priest, and confirmed by the Council. A few years later (early 1980's), this was amended such that the Chairman of the Council appoint ed Councillors, with C ouncil confirmation. This was changed to the current system of elec tion by IV*+ Masters in December, 2000. The following summary was offered by Dr. Aquino to the Priesthood in support of this amendment (and 4.08, amended at the same time). Summary: Until now, selection of both Councillors and the office of Chairman of the Council of Nine has been a \"top-down\" process: The Chairman nominates individuals for vacant Council seats, and the High Priest nominates a Councillor for the Chairmanship. While this procedure has worked well over the years, its defect is that it tends to insulate the Council as a self-selecting body, accountable only to itself. Similarly the High Priest has strong control over the Chairmanship with exclusive annual nomin ating power for that office. The effect of these amendments is to change this to a \"botto m-up\" process. The Master s of the Temple will nominate and vote on individuals for vacant Co uncil seats. The Councillors will nominate and vote on one of theimselves to serve as Chairman. Section 4.06:Quorum A quorum of the Council is all nine voting members. Assuming there are nine voting members, then all formal Council actions require that all nine be notified of the action, and that all nine have the opportunity to participate, however, long that might require. If there are not nine voting members, then most formal C ouncil actions (such as confirmation of a IV° master) may not take place until the Council is filled. Only those actions listed in se ction 4.06 as exceptions may occu r within the Council when the Council has fewer than nine voting members."},{"pageNumber":1283,"pageContent":"When this section was last amended, the Chairman appointed Councillors, and the Council confirmed that appointment. Since only the Counc il of Nine could confirm appointment of a ninth Councillor when that position was vacan t, the Council obviously needed to act to confirm such appointments with less than Nine. This had been done whenever there have been fewer than nine Councillors. The method selec tion of Councillors in section 4.04 was changed at the end of XXXV, and the Council no longer approves such selections. This clause is therefore moot. Similarly, since before December XXXV only the Chairman could appoint a Ninth, and only the Council of Nine could confirm the appointme nt of a Chairman by the High Priest when that position was vacant, the Council could act to confirm the High Priest's appointment of a new Chairman. The method of selection of the Chairman in section 4.08 was changed at the end of XXXV, that that amendmen t specifies that all Council v acancies must be filled before the new Chairman may be elected. That amendment supercedes this clause. Since removal of a Councillor incapable of serving can require action even though that Councillor is incapable of partic ipating (due to stroke, coma, or similarly serious problem), and such removal may be necessary for the Council to confirm a replacement and then perform other needed functions, such removal of an incapacitated Councillor may require confirmation by an incomplete Council. This clause remains in effect. Section 4.08: Election of the Chairman Amendment history: In our bylaws as original ly adopted, the High Pr iest was assigned the responsibility and authority for appointing the Chairman of the Council of Nine each year. This continued with very minor amendmen ts until December, 2000, when the Priesthood approved an amendment proposed by Dr. Aqui no that the Chairman be elected by the Council. A summary of the reasoning for th is amendment can be found in section 4.04 (amended at the same time). Section 4.09: Chairman Pro-Tem Per my discussion of section 4.06, the confir mation of the appointment of a Chairman normally requires a quorum of Nine. If there is an incumbent Chairman and a vacancy on the Council, then filling the Council's vacancy takes precedence over appointment of a new Chairman. If the Chairmanship is vacant, then that appointment take s precedence (since the Chairman is the one to appoint a new Councillor to fill the Council's vacancy. The High Priest appoints the Chairman, and if th e position is vacant, this appointment can be approved by the Council even if there are fewe r than nine. If the office of High Priest is vacant, then the Executive Director appoint s the Chairman, and the Council confirms the appointment. However, if all three positions are vacant (HP, CC9, and ED), then there is nobody to appoint the needed officers according to our bylaws. This new section (added in the year XXXIV) provides insurance against such a situation. Note: At this time the senior Councillor is Magistra Aquino, with Ipsissimus Lewis being next in line."},{"pageNumber":1284,"pageContent":"Section 4.10: Investigations This section 4.10 is necessary, and also problema tic. This is a power which is needed by the Council in order to fulfill their responsibilities as guardians of the Temple. It's also a power which not only can be subject to abuse, but that abuse has been feared by various members. In my experience, that fear is unfounded, empowered more by the myth of section 4.10 1 than by any historical use or abuse of the section. The High Priest points out that section 4.10 has not been formally invoked while he has been HP, and I believe it has been invoked only once in the nine years I have been Chairman. The High Pr iest also wishes to point out that the purpose of section 4.10 is simply the safeguarding of the Temple through information. Previously, this section as written could be in terpreted as applying only to III°+ members, and only to papers they hold. This is largely because a) the III°+ owns the Te mple of Set, with the power of amending the bylaws and articles of in corporation, b) expulsion of the III°+ requires confirmation by the Council, and violation of 4.10 is one of the causes of almost certain expulsion and confirmation, c) the III°+ are likely to have thos e papers and documents which contain information critical to the organization, d) papers cont ain objective information, while information not on paper is less objective/reliable. It was therefore argued at times that the I° a nd II° didn't have to abide by the intent of this section, that the Council needs and has access to any information which pertains to the organization. It had also been argued that information held by th e III°+ which is not on paper (eg: personal knowledge not wr itten down) also need not be given to the Council. This was mostly correct, but not entirely, adding to conflicts a nd arguments concerning this bylaw section, and therefore to its myth of abuse. A second problem with the previous wording of this section was that the safety of confidentiality, the requirement that distribution of any such information outside the Council is forbidden without the Chairm an's written authorization, ap plied formally only to paper documents obtained from III°+ members through this section. It did not cover paper documents obtained from I° or II° members, a nd it did not cover information that was not on paper. This section was therefore amended in the ye ar XXXIV to resolve these problems and others mentioned below. A third problem was that there was no appeal process. If a Councillor demanded to see specific papers, those papers were to be handed over, even if the member knew the papers had no significance to the Councillor's concerns. We therefore added an optio n of appeal to the Chairman for such situations.Note that the ap peal process does involve sending the requested papers to the Chairman or his delegate -- the appeal will be decided based on the information involved, not on claims about the information. We also had the problem that if a III°+ member had such papers or documentation and did not wish to give same to the Council, he needed only destroy those papers before being asked for them (or claim he did), and then since the pape rs didn't exist he was not properly subject to this section (though he could be expe lled by 3.09-3.12 as discussed above)."},{"pageNumber":1285,"pageContent":"Note that as Priest Kauschen pointed out, many people routinely delete email after a short period of time. Such ordinary deletion of ema il would not be considered \"destruction of papers\" for the purpose of preventing the Counc il from reviewing the material. Likewise, most people discard paper mail after a period of time. Even those of us who don't discard it lose track of it after a while (I have every le tter received from every Setian since sometime during my II° days, somewhere in the house, but don't ask me where!). However, again, if someone is raising a stink or expressing concerns about something received by mail, especially if they're quoting fr om it, I think it's reasonable to assume they have not yet discarded it. To be doing so, and then suddenly say the material has be en destroyed after it's been asked for, is a suspicious combination. There's also the question of why the whatever was discarded or destroyed. Most of us discard things because they're no longe r of interest, or they take up too much room. There's no expectation that anyone has an in terest in these papers. However, if someone has papers that bear directly on issues of importance to the Temp le as an organization, pa pers that he expects the Council will/would want to see, he should then be expected to offer them to the Council if they are indeed desired. The acti on of discarding or destroying t hose papers specifically is an action of preventing the Council from collecting information important to the Temple's organizational welfare. That is the type of action the year-XXXIV amendment was aimed at. Finally, it should be strongly noted that this section applies strictly to papers, documents, and by extension to information which involves the Temple , the organization, its officers, and its Priesthood and membership as Priests and members, not papers, documents, or information which involve individuals as individuals, re gardless of degree or office. If papers or information should be demanded which involves i ndividuals and not the Temple, that is the time to properly ask the Chai rman for such evaluation. Section 4.13: Recall of the Chairman The bylaws of the Temple excel in the application of checks and balances. The High Priest has nearly absolute power, in cluding the power to expel any member, except a) he can't expel a Councillor, b) actions wh ich affect the foundation of the Temple (IV°+ Recognitions, III°+ expulsions, and appointment of the Chairman) require Council confirmation, c) he may not violate the bylaws, and d) he can be removed by the Chairman. In every case where a member or officer of the Temple is given authority or power, there is a procedure of checks and balances which can either prevent or reverse the abuse of that power. The most powerful officers within the Temple, those with the most ability to damage the Temple, are the High Priest and the Chairman of the Council. Each is checked and balanced by the other. The person who can remove the High Priest from office is the Chairman of the Council, and the person who appoints the new Chairman each year is the High Priest. However, this tight relationship leaves an area where our normal checks and balances can fail. If the position of High Priest becomes vacan t, and the Chairman manages to appoint a \"puppet\" High Priest who always reappoints the Chairman, these tw o together can conspire to turn the Council into a puppet C ouncil, and then rule the organi zation as they wish, without any checks or balances. If a High Priest should manage to appoint a \"puppet\" Chairman, these"},{"pageNumber":1286,"pageContent":"two together have a similar opportunity. (It's unlikely that the Council of Nine would permit such puppets to be appointed, but we're intenti onally looking at the unexpected and unlikely here.) We therefore added sections 4.13 and 5.09 to give the Priesthood of Set (as a body) the power to recall either or both of the Chairman a nd the High Priest. Upon a successful recall, the vacated positions would be filled following proc edures specified in the bylaws. (High Priest appoints Chairman, Chairman appoints High Prie st, and if both are vacated then the E.D. appoints the new Chairman, all subj ect to Council confirmation.) Article 5 -- High Priest of Set Section 5.01: Authority of the High Priest The responsibility and authority to determine al l policies and programs of the Temple of Set, ... shall rest with the High Priest of Set (provi ded they do not conflict wi th superior rules). Note that there is no provision for confirmation or override here. The High Priest's authority is absolute in this area. In other words, unless an action or decision of the High Priest's is mentioned within the Bylaws as being subject to confirmation or overr ide, it isn't. If the Chairman and/or Council feel that the High Priest is d eciding or acting wrongly or badly, their only official course of action is to remove the High Priest. (Of cour se, they will use their powers of discussion, reason, and persuasion before taking such an extreme course of action.) Likewise, any Setian who feels that a High Prie st's policy or decision is wrong, improper, or poor, may discuss that disagreement with the Hi gh Priest and/or with any Councillor. This type of discussion is the proper wa y to get such decisions changed. Section 5.03: Qualification Only IV°+ Masters of the Temple may be consid ered for the position of High Priest. To date, all High Priests have been V°+ Magi. Section 5.04: Appointment The Chairman of the Council sha ll appoint the High Priest. This action can be taken only with a full Council of Nine. If ther e is a vacancy on the Council, the Chairman and Council shall fill any vacancy first, before appointing a Hi gh Priest. (The Executive Director shall be responsible for acting in the High Pr iest's place during such time.) Section 5.06: Removal The Chairman of the Council may remove the High Pr iest from office if he feels that there is just cause for doing so. There are several sections in the bylaws which deal with removals from office, expulsions, and similar topics: 3.08 through 3.13, 3.17, 3.22, 4.05, 5.06, 6.06, and 7.04. In some of these"},{"pageNumber":1287,"pageContent":"it's fairly clear that such actions take place imme diately. In others it's not quite so clear. To clarify: All such removals, expulsions, and similar actions take effect immediately. All such removals, expulsions, and similar actions either require Council confirmation (as specified in the bylaws) or are subject to appeal (any III° + member may appeal any such action to the Council of Nine through any Councillor). Note that while there is no appeal process me ntioned in the bylaws for I° and II° expulsion, the Council is able to determine that the expulsi on or whatever was not proper, and to request that the High Priest and/or other(s) reverse the decision. Th e Council will review all such matters when requested by a III°+ member. This applies equally to c onfirmed III° expulsions should new information concerning such be given to the Council. Examples: • III°+ members expelled by the High Priest ar e stripped of their powers to admit or expel I° and II° members immediately, while the Council examines that expulsion for confirmation. If the Council denies the expul sion, those powers are then returned to the Priest of Set. Exception: such III°+ members retain the right to vote on bylaws amendments until their e xpulsion is confirmed. • Officers are immediately removed from offi ce and authority. The Executive Director may no longer process memberships as the E.D., the Treasurer may no longer sign checks, the High Priest may no longer Recognize IV°+ initia tes, etc. However, those offices may not be filled until the re moval is confirmed by the Council. • Councillors are immediately stripped of the power given in section 4.10. They retain only the right to confirm or deny actions before the C ouncil, including their own removal as Councillor. They also may not be expelled from the Temple until after their removal as Councillor is confirmed by the Council. The general principle followed here is that the person being removed, expelled, or whatever, is immediately prevented from (further) abuse of power. This action is taken to protect the Temple and its members from abuse. However, those powers they hold which protect them (and others) against th e abuse of power by ot hers is retained. On a related topic, we have seen occasional members of the Temple resign, and then very shortly recant their resignation. We've seen oc casional members of the Temple resign with future effective dates, and then recant their resignation before that future date arrives. Growing impatience with this type of activity has led to the consensus that any resignation statement always takes effect immediately, unl ess the High Priest de cides otherwise. (We won't prevent anyone who is leaving from sm oothly closing down his activity and turning responsibilities over to others. However, so meone who has announced a resignation will not be able to recant that resigna tion as if it were not made w ithout the High Priest's explicit permission.) Anyone who resigns from the Temple and then changes their mind will always be more than welcome to do so, but the \"change of mind\" will normally mean they need to apply to rejoin the Temple as I° or II° (which will normally be readily granted), rather than being able to reverse their resignation and continue with membership uninterrupted."},{"pageNumber":1288,"pageContent":"Section 5.07: Compensation The High Priest may receive a salary, if determ ined by the Chairman of the Council. No High Priest has yet received any salary or other co mpensation (other than fair reimbursement of expenses), and given the Temple's finances and budget, none is expected in the near future. Article 6 -- Executive Director Section 6.02: E.D. as Vice President The Executive Director shall perform all dut ies of a corporate vice president/secretary required by law. I read this to mean that the E.D. does not assu me the post of High Priest if the latter position is empty, but in such situations the E.D. w ould take on all responsib ilities and authorities including those deali ng with expulsion, admission, Recognition, the going into debt, and appointment of the Chairman (most of these mo re critical authoritie s require confirmation by the Council). Section 6.07: Compensation The Executive Director may receive compensa tion in addition to fair reimbursement of expenses. The E.D.'s work certainly warrants compensation, but we do not have the finances to pay the E.D. what she is worth. We curr ently give the E.D. a token honorarium. Article 7 -- Treasurer Section 7.07: Financial Records The Treasurer's records are open for inspection at any reasonable time by any member of the Temple of Set holding the III°+. In addition, the Treasurer sends the annual financial statement to the High Priest and Council at the beginning of each year. Any Priest of the Temple of Set may request a copy of the latest annual financial statement from the Treasurer.

The Treasurer's work certainly warrants compensation, but we do not have the finances to pay the Treasurer what she is worth. We currently give the Treasurer a token honorarium.

Once founded, a Grand Master may turn over direct responsibility for the Orde r to another IV°+ Master, or with the High Priest's approval to a III° Priest who will th en be called the \"Acting Grand Master.\" III° Acting Grand Masters may hold th is position only with the con tinuing sponsorship of a IV°+ Master of the Temple who holds the ultimate authority and ultimate re sponsibility for the Order. Section 10.02: Authority The Grand Master or Co-Grand Masters of an Or der exercises complete authority over that Order subject to these By-Laws. For instan ce, the Grand Master of an Order may not authorize nor cause the Order to go into debt , since only the High Priest and Chairman may authorize any debt owed by th e Temple or its subgroups. Article 11 -- Pylons Section 11.02: Authority The Sentinel/Co-Sentinel of a Pylon exercises co mplete authority over that Pylon subject to these By-Laws and any policies of the High Pr iest concerning Pylons published in the Jeweled Tablets of Set. For instance, the Sentin el of a Pylon may not authorize nor cause the Pylon to go into debt, since only the High Priest and Chairman may authorize any debt owed by the Temple or its subgroups. You'll note that section 11.02 stat es explicitly that Pylons are subject to policies decided by the High Priest under section 5.01, but section 10.02 does not subject Or ders to the same oversight. In other words, the High Priest is not empowered to issue a section 5.01 policy concerning Order finances, Order membership, etc. I believe this is a good thing, but considering th e very few rules concerning Orders recorded in the Bylaws, we must realize the possibility that a GM might get carried away and take actions which are harmful to the Temple of Se t. We therefore need to recognize the checks and balances which allow us to deal with this situation. Specifically, the High Priest has the ability to expel a Grand Master who takes such harmful actions. The same checks and balances also apply to Pylon Sentinels. As Dr. Aquino put it: As with Pylons, I think that an Order should have a certain \"tenure\" in terms of its existence. If a C/GM acts irresponsibly, th e HP's present recourse under th e By-Laws is directly to the responsible conduct of that individual personally , regardless whether the problematic behavior is in the context of Order-work or otherwise. Since only a IV°+ may GM an Orde r, expulsion [if correction short of that is refused] of the IV°+ halts the problem actions. If other individu als persist with similar actions, they can also be addressed as individuals."},{"pageNumber":1290,"pageContent":"In this system an Order closes only if there is no IV°+ willing to assume responsibility as its GM [or to sponsor a temporary III° Acting GM]. In addition, Section 7.12 states \"Only the High Priest or the Chairman of the Council may authorize the incurring of short- term indebtedness, such as char ge accounts, in the name of the Temple of Set.\" Since Orders and Pylons are part of the Temple of Set, all property held by the Order or Pylon (real property, material property, intellectual property, and financial property) is also property of the Temple of Se t. While the GM and Sentinel has full control over that property while the Order or Pylon ex ists, should the Order or Pylon disband, that property reverts to the Temple of Set. Likewise, if a GM or Sentinel were to incur any debt in the name of the Order or Pylon, that debt would revert to the Temple of Set upon the disbanding of the Order or Pylon. Therefore, only the High Priest or the Chairman of the Council may authorize an Order or Pylon going into debt. Article 12 -- Amendmen ts to the Bylaws Section 12.02: Amendments Any amendment to the bylaws requires a 3/4 affirmative vote of all III°+ members of the Temple of Set. That means that if there ar e 80 members of the Priesthood, we need 60 votes in favor of any amendment, or it fails. As we grow, we will eventually need to reduce this percentage or change the quorum from all III°+ members to some subset (perhaps something like a 3/4 majority provided 80% or more of the III°+ members cast a vote) . We will need to do this before this quorum requirement becomes a problem, but I suspect we have a few years yet before this becomes critical. Section 12.04: Voting Upon receipt of a valid petition to amend the bylaws, the Temple of Set shall immediately cease all programs and activities involving th e issue in question until the vote has been conducted, announced, and implemented. This section needs to be handled reasonably. For instance, if someone submits a Bylaws amendment which concerns Bylaws amendments, we can't immediately cease the process of amending the Bylaws. We also need to recognize that there are legal requirements the Temple must meet, such as the regular filing of our continued existence as a corporation, the payment of debts owed, etc. Those types of activities need to continue w ithin reason while the Bylaws amendment activity proceeds.

Section 13.04: Written Notice / E-mail Section 13.04 was added to the bylaws in the year XXXIV in recognition of the growing use, convenience, and reliability of email. Note that as of June, XXXIV, the entire Council of Nine and the entire IV°+ Magistry a ll had email capabilities, and al l but a handful of the Priesthood have email capabilities. Section 13.04 was ther efore added to specifica lly permit the use of email in votes and other written notices. However, because email is inherently not fully reliable, some guidelines should be followed for its use: • Do not post formal notices to an administra tive mailing list and assume the E.D. will read it. Any email notice must be sent pe rsonally and directly to the E.D.'s email account. • Email messages do sometimes evaporate in cyberspace. Unless you get positive confirmation that the message has been read by the E.D., do not assume it has been. Even confirmation that the message has been delivered is not sufficient, since the E.D.'s service provider can lose the messa ge. If you do not receive confirmation that the message has been read in a reasonable period of time, you may ask the E.D. about it, or send the notification by postal mail. • Even postal mail sometimes gets lost. It can be advisable to verify delivery of postal notices through return receipt or email. Footnotes 1. This section was known as 4.09 before th e addition of the new/current section 4.09. Charter of the Order of the Trapezoid Classification: V2 - D14.01 - 1 Author: Michael A. Aquino VI°, Roger Whitaker III° Date:  January  30,  XVIII  HTML Revision: N ov. 26, 1998 CE Subject: Order of the Trapezoid Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1292,"pageContent":"“When once the restraining talisman of the Chri stian cross is broken in Germany, then the fury of the ancient warr iors, the berserk rage of which the Nordic poets sang, will surge up again. The old stone gods will rise from long-for gotten ruins and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes; and Thor with his giant hammer will le ap up and smash the Gothic cathedrals. And when that crash comes, it wi ll be like nothing heard before in history.“ - Heinrich Heine, 1834 Introduction The \"mainstream\" of the Western magical tradit ion may be said to have a Mediterranean origin: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome -- and the later synthe ses of these ancient cultures through the Medieval, Renai ssance, and Enlightenment eras. In marked contrast to the Mediterranean traditio n is the school of thought which originated in the northern areas of Europe and Scandinavia: th e Nordic or Germanic tradition. Most notable in this tradition, of course, is its lack of features either deri vative of Judaeo/Christianity or prior to and prototypical of it. The Germanic metaphysics devel oped in an alien environment, remained largely isolated from the Mediterra nean influence during the Roman Empire, and were suppressed rather than assimilated dur ing the Christian centuries which followed. It was in the late 19th century C.E. that this ancient Germanic tradition returned to play more than a mere mythological part in European affair s. It is perhaps not surprising that it surfaced in the Second Reich of Kaiser Wilhelm I a nd Otto von Bismarck. Unti l their unification by Prussia, the Germanic states had been weak and unstable in comparison to the larger nation- states of the continent. Periodically rava ged by foreign armies, Germany had earned the unenviable title of the \"b attleground of Europe.\" The 19th century heralded the onset of a new move ment in European culture: Romanticism. It was a reaction to and a rejection of the methodical , practical -- but just as often frustrating and stifling -- scientific materialism which had re sulted from the industrial revolution. In its original, more transcultural sense, Roman ticism implied uninhibited individualism. In Germany, however, it gripped the imagination to a somewhat deeper degree. Gustau Pauli, in Dehio's Geschichte der deutschen Kunst (1919-1934), states: Romanticism is Germanic and reached its purest expression in those terr itories which are most free from Roman colonization. Ever ything that is regarded as an essential aspect of the romantic spirit: irrationalism, the mystic weldi ng together of subject and object, the tendency to intermingle the arts, the longing for the far-aw ay and the strange, the feeling for the infinite and the continuity of historic developmen t -- all these are characteristic of German Romanticism, and so much so that their union remains unintelligible to the Latins. What is known as Romanticism in France has only its na me in common with German Romanticism. Crucial also to German Romanticism were the concepts of dynamism and life-worship . The former term represents an urge towards constant movement and evolution, whether intellectual, artistic, or social. It differs from the Setian concept of Xeper in that Romantic dynamism is non-Platonic; it is supra-rational rath er than guided by logic, ethics, and Noetic apprehension."},{"pageNumber":1293,"pageContent":"German Romantic life-worship was not love and respect for the phenomenon of life per se, but rather a compulsion to exercise one's own lif e -- to \"really live\" ra ther than to simply exist. Again this is commendable, but as w ith dynamism it can be dangerous in excess -- when one's \"rage to live\" interrupts and consumes the lives of others. The uncanny attraction of the Third Reich -- Nazi Germany -- lies in the fact that it endorsed and practiced both dynamism and life-worship without restraint and to a world-shaking degree of success. In The Revolution of Nihilism (1939), Hermann Rauschning said: This irrational element in National Socialism is the actual source of its strength. It is the reliance on it that accounts for its \"sleepwalk er's immunity\" in the face of one practical problem after another. It explains why it was possible for National Socialism to attain power almost without the slightest tangible idea of what it was going to do. The movement was without even vague general ideas on the subj ect; all it had was boundle ss confidence: things would smooth themselves out one way or anothe r ... Its strength lay in incessant activity and in embarking on anything so long as it kept things moving ... National Socialism is action pure and simple, dynamics in vacuo , revolution at a variable tempo, ready to be changed at any moment. Similarly the life-worship of the Third Re ich was not what the \"Mediterranean\" mind understands by this term. The \"life\" is the life of the state, or more properly the Volk (perhaps best translated as the \"soul of the people \"). The individual achieve s self-realization as, through his efforts, he contributes to the strengthening of this \"soul\". Just as the Third Reich's dynamism got out of hand, leading it to em bark on irrational and destructive conquests abroad, so its life-worship -- which could ha ve been a truly evolutionary synthesis of the most sublime ideas of Hege l and Nietzsche -- became perverted into crude xenophobia, hatreds built upon superficial notio ns of \"race\", and ultimately a maddened stampede towards a Wagnerian Gotterdaemmerung in defiance of a return to rationalism. Said Heinrich Himmler on April 21, 1945: We have made serious mistakes. If I could have a fresh start, I would do many things differently now. But it is too late. We wanted greatness and security for Germany, and we are leaving behind us a pile of ruins, a fallen world ... The Order of the Trapezoid proposes to extract the positive, the constructive, and the exalted from the Germanic magical tradition -- and to ju st as carefully avoid and reject those excesses and distortions which have made this traditi on an object of the most extraordinary fear, condemnation, and suppression in the postwar peri od. The Germanic tradition is also part of the legacy of the Prince of Darkness, hence the Temple of Set has no more reason to fear it than it has many other manifestations of the Powers of Darkness in the world. Nevertheless the care require d in any investigation into this tradition cannot be overemphasized. Magical and research ability is not enough; ethical sensitivity and social discretion are just as important. The prospect s for new and wonderful perspectives on the Black Art are exhilarating, but success will come only if the Order conducts its affairs with the same dedication and nobility that has made the Temple of Set a legend in its time."},{"pageNumber":1294,"pageContent":"Lineage of the Order The Order of the Trapezoid was founded as an in formal Order within the Church of Satan by the authority of Anton Szandor LaVey as High Pr iest. Its existence was first announced in the December V (1970 C.E.) Cloven Hoof : The Order of the Trapezoid is th e \"board of directors\" and secu rity staff of the Church. Its functions are many, and its members are chosen by appointment, acco rding to the special abilities and attributes of each. All Priests and Priestesses are automatically admitted into the Order, although the identities of most members of the Order are unknown even to each other. Members of the Governing or Grand Council of the Trapezoid are known only to the High Priest, who solicits th eir aid when required. There was a strong Germanic element in the r ituals of the early Chur ch of Satan, deriving from the musical imagery of Richard Wagner a nd from the visual imagery of Weimar-era Expressionism (Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig) . The significance of the trapezoid itself came from its suggestion of perspective and the distor tion of that perspective in such U.F.A. films as Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Der Golem . From ritual use of sim ilar angles and planes in such ceremonies as \"Die Elecktrische vorspielen\" (in The Satanic Rituals ), Anton LaVey made observations resulting in his \"Law of the Trapezoid\": All obtuse angles are magically harmful to those unaware of this property. The same angles are beneficial, stimulating, and energizing to those who are magically sensitive to them. In the December V Cloven Hoof article, five literary sources for this principle were identified: William Mortensen's The Command to Look , Louis McCarty's The Great Pyramid Jeezeh , Sheila Ostrander & Lynn Schroeder's Ps ychic Discoveries Be hind the Iron Curtain (chapter 27), Frank Belknap Long's The Hounds of Tindalos , and H.P. Lovecraft's The Haunter of the Dark . The Council of the Trapezoid, alte rnatively identified as the C ouncil of Nine, was in fact an informal, unofficial cabinet without fixed me mbership, terms, or functions -- and with no binding decision-making power. In X A.S. it attained formal status as th e corporate board of directors and supreme executive bo dy of the Temple of Set. Apart from early Council meetings, which ceased ca. late V, no Order meetings or functions distinct from those of the Priesthood were held in the Church of Satan. In VI the Order was officially defined as comprising the III°-V° in itiates within the Church, i.e.: the collective Satanic Priesthood. In VIII Anton LaVey again rec onstituted the Order to identify significant contributors to and representatives of the Sa tanic tradition, within or without the formal Church and Priesthood. Again there were no mee tings, functions, or publications of this Order. From X to XIV the Order was again used as an alternate designation for all degrees within the Priesthood of Set, and at the Se t-I Conclave in XIV the Council of Nine replaced the Satanic trident in its emblem with the Tcham sceptre of Set. At the Set- III Conclave in XVI the Order was once again reconstituted, this time as an honorary designation for all present and past members of the Council of Nine, and its embl em was condensed to a pentagram within a trapezoid."},{"pageNumber":1295,"pageContent":"In the Walhalla or \"Hall of the Dead\" at Castle We welsburg, Westphalia -- the subterranean sanctum sanctorum of the German castle which Heinrich Himmler had reconstructed for his own Workings in the Black Art -- Michael Aqui no, High Priest of Set, conducted a Working on October 19, XVII. One of the results of this Working was the regeneration of the Order of the Trapezoid as a truly functioning Order unde r the authority of the Temple of Set. This charter is consequent to the Wewelsburg Wo rking. It is intended not to define the limits of the Order of the Trapezoid, but to establish its true identity, e ssence, and point of departure. Definition The Order of the Trapezoid (O. .. .T. .. .) is an order of knight hood characterized by strict personal honor and faithfulness to the quest for the Grail. The O. .. .T. .. . is a knighthood in that its members are pledged to the traditional chival ric virtues as appropriate to each situation encountered. By honor is meant a sense of justice, ethics , and responsibility prior to personal comfort, convenience, or advantage. This honor is known by one's faithfulness to the Quest for the Grail, which is the self, soul, or psyc he made perfect through c onscious refinement and exercise of the Will. Attainment of the Grail re sults in transformation of the individual into a state of dynamic existence energized by the psyc he, not by the physical body derived from the material universe. Hence the O. .. .T. .. . is the gate to psychecentric immortality beyond physical death. Authority The O. .. .T. .. . is established and consecrated by authorit y of the High Priest of Set under section # 5.01 of the Bylaws of the Temple of Set. As such it is the only order of knighthood recognized and sanctioned by the Prince of Darkness. Motto The motto of the O. .. .T. .. . is \"Walhalla\" (pronounced \"Valhall a\"). It signifies that, though the physical body through which a member of the Orde r is manifest may wither or be destroyed, the individual consciousness has become That which cannot be destroyed or lose its coherence. It may return again to a corporeal sh ell, or it may manifest its existence in other ways, endlessly, in accordance with its Will. The Motto also identifies the consecrated chamber beneath the Wewelsburg in which th e Order was itself returned to life. Insignia The insignia of the O. .. .T. .. . shall be an inverse pentagram whose four upper points define the limits and angles of a phi -trapezoid. From the nethermost point of the pentagram radiates the Black Flame of Set, whose nine tongues signi fy the Council of the Trapezoid and complete the angular relationships of the pentagram a nd trapezoid. Rising from the Black Flame is a Tcham sceptre, symbol of Pharaonic authority from ancient Egypt bearing the head and forked tail of Set. The sceptre faces to the left, symbolic of the Left-Hand Path of Black Magic. The space between the Black Flame and the Tcham sceptre forms the letter \"W\", signifying \"Walhalla\". This is both the name of the chamber in the Wewelsburg, Westphalia wherein the Order was consecrated and the fa mous hall of eternal life to which ancient Teutonic heroes were brought by the Walkyrie s and admitted by Wotan. Thus the letter \"W\""},{"pageNumber":1296,"pageContent":"has a fivefold meaning (including the Motto of th e Order) in addition to its primary reference. In the topmost three gaps between the pent agram and the trapezoid are the numbers 666, symbolic of the Prince of Darkne ss and of the First and Second Beasts revealed of him. The three sixes add to XVIII, the first Working Y ear following the creation of the Church of Satan, and the year in which the O. .. .T. .. . was returned to life. In the entire emblem there are no curved lines, signifying the Black Magical po wer of angular relations hips and the Law of the Trapezoid. The emblem is further mathematically keyed to the phi -ratio. Colors of the emblem are normally silver against a black field, though the design may be represented in black against a silver/white or red background. Membership There are two levels of membership in the O. .. .T. .. .: the Knighthood and the Masters of the Order. Conferring of Knighthood is by decision of any Ma ster of the Order, and upon signature to the Oath of the Order. Thereafter each member is under obedience to no other member of the Order, but rather to the divinity of the psyche (in ancient Teutonic, the fylgja ). Members of the Order may use the prefix \"Sir\" or \"Lady\", the initials \"O. .. .T. .. .\" or \"O.T.\" after their names, and the rune Tyr ( ) as a mark of identification to other members of the Order. Installation as a Master of th e Order is by decision of the Gr and Master. A Master of the O. .. .T. .. . must also have been Recognized as a Priest of Set III. Titles of address for Masters of the Order are the same as for th e Knighthood, but the identifying rune Hagall ( ) is employed. The Grand Master of the O. .. .T. .. . is appointed by the High Priest of Set and must also have been Recognized as a Master of the Temple of Set IV. Title of address for the Grand Master is the same as for the Knighthood, but the identifying rune Eolh ( ) is employed. Any member of the O. .. .T. .. . is free to retire from the Orde r honorably at any time by declaring his Oath withdrawn. Dismissal of any member of the Order is by decision of the Grand Master. Tenure of the Grand Master is only by decision of the High Priest of Set. Since the Order of the Trapezoid is an Order w ithin the Temple of Set, membership in the Temple will be a prerequisite for membership in the Order. There will be provision for honorary membership for non-members of the Temple, but, as is the case with honorary memberships in the Temple itself, these wi ll be administered most sparingly and conscientiously. The Oath The Oath is sworn by every aspirant to the Order upon admission to the Knighthood. The aspirant's signature is affixed in jet ink; then the area of the paper c overed by the signature is browned with the heat of a flame. Upon receipt of the Oath, and upon the word of a Master of the Order, the Grand Master shall confirm the Kn ighthood. The Oath-paper is sent to the aspirant upon the request of a Master of the Order. The text of the Oath is thus:"},{"pageNumber":1297,"pageContent":"I, (name), do hereby swear fealty to the fylgja that is my immortal Doppelgaenger and pledge obedience beyond d eath unto life eternal in Walhalla .

It is not my Order or that of anyone else. Being a pa rt of Set's Temple, it is a divi sion which has been entrusted to us by the Lord of Darkness. The Temple itself is entrusted to us for the best and highest uses we can extract from it. Orders are smaller and more specialized Temples of Set, and again I stress that these are the property of Set, not of James Lewis or Michael Aquino or any other senior Initiate. Being aware of this fact brings to the forefront the responsibility of each of us working under the aegis of Leviathan, and that extends from the newest entrant to the Grand Master. I am not so Christian as to expect Set to await me seated in the hereafte r at the infernal equivalent of the pearly gates with a record of my life in his ha nds, but it is my belief that each of us according to our understanding must answer to bo th Set and our individual selves regarding our use of the Temple and the Order. It behoove s us therefore to make prudent use of those things belonging to Set. It has been the prerogative of Magistri Temp li to establish Orders since the elder days. Whether the face guiding the time is that of Set or HarWer, the duties are there for all members of an Order. For this reason you will see Orders guided by the wisdom of Understanding. Steered by this, an Order can Come Into Being and Remanifest itself as the Temple-enhancing factor it is meant to be in accord with the Current of the Aeon, that wording itself referring directly to the Will of Set.

The newsletter has had a long history, and began as a dot matrix printout entitled Th e Order of Leviathan . Its history can be traced th rough the first volume of Gems from the Trail . Appearing on a monthly basis, The Trail of the Serpent had maintained an almost unbroken schedule, having taken only a nine month sabbatical a few years back. Its issues are an open forum and organ for the members of the Order. Non-Members of the Order are also free to continue submissions as desired, and limited subscriptions are vailable to those who write requesting them. The Trail of the Serpent and other publications of the Order are distributed to Order members at no charge to the Initiate or the Temp le of Set. Non-members of the Order receive their limited subscription of The Trail of the Serpent at no charge. Non-members of the Order can purchase the Gems of the Trail volumes through The Ruby Tablet of Set editor. Each year articles from the tw elve previous issues are compiled into a single volume and published in sequential order. There is no charge for this for Order of Leviathan members, who receive their copies at the same time the original camera-ready copy goes to Magister Menschel for the Ruby Tablet . As of XXVIII there are five Gems volumes available. Also available to non-members of the Order through the Ruby Tablet of Set is The Tarot Trumps . These began as a filler for one of the early issues of The Trail of the Serpent and became a monthly feature, each dealing with the symbolism of the Aleister Crowley Thoth tarot deck. Like the Gems volumes, The Tarot Trumps is sent at no charge to Order of Leviathan members. Not available outside the Order is The Pyramid Letters , a reprinting of a collection of letters written within my Thord and Fourth Degree days during the Temple's Xem era. This document, extensively footnoted, is an excu rsion into the Temple's history under the increasingly iron-fisted reign of the previous High Priest, Ronald K. Barrett. Initiates with questions about the Xem period of the Temple's history have found The Pyramid Letters an enlightning source of knowledge. Also not available to non-members of the Order is the series of OL Letters . These began in XXIV after the New Orleans Conclave and go t each member of the Order. They are intended to discuss OL-pertinent matters which might or might not appear in The Trail of the Serpent . The High Priest of Set receive s courtesy copies of these OL Letters as they appear.

It cont ains works by members of the Order and Magi dealing with Coming Into Being. These expl orations take the form of serious pieces covering many avenues of the Path. Responses from receipients of The Book of Leviathan have been consistently positive. The Book is maintained in looseleaf format to easily faciliate revisions and additions to its historical docum ents, Order of Leviatha n reading list, and new entries.

Setians aspiring to the Order of Leviathan should first attain th e Second Degree before looking at this or any other Order. Orders are specialized areas of the Temple of Set, and just as not everyone is expected to explore the same fields in the mundane world, so not everyone is going to work profitably within the framework of a singl e Order. Hence, an Initiate may find the Order of Leviathan perfect for his own progress while a close Setian friend may feel the OTR to be the answer. No Grand Master is particul arly happy with the thought of anyone Order-hopping any more than fashionable restaurants take to the id ea of customers table-hopp ing. Neither is it a particularly good idea to enter more than one Or der. The specialty areas are serious endeavors in furthering the aims of the Temple of Se t, and no one should go about collecting them as one would baseball cards. It is a Year XXVIII policy of the Order of Leviathan to notify Temple of Set Grand Masters of planned affilia tion moves so that conflicts and later problems will be averted. It is also an excellent idea to take some months after Second Degr ee Recognition to become accustomed to being Adept. These new Magical muscles which the Second Degree Initiate has need some exercising in order to fi ne-tune. Newly Recognized Adepti who request admission to the Order of Leviathan are frequent ly advised to look around in the Temple at its other Orders. Some Initiates do so and later opt for entry into a nother Order while some return to those doors bearing th e seal of Leviathan. Entry into the Order is not automatic once that takes place. Other members of the Order, if aspirants are known to them, are of ten consulted for their opinions . [On the other side of that coin, Setians interested in the Order are welc ome to contact Priesthood and Adept members of the Order for their opinions of this section of the Temple of Set.] Those who actively pursue membership are asked to exchange some dialogue with the Grand Master, so that he can form a better and educated opinion of the aspirant's su itability for membership in the Order. If this seems complex and delay-provoking, I think it bette r to exercise care and caution so members of the Order can obtain the maximum benefit fr om it rather than having simply a certain number of names on a role.

The Order of Leviathan currently has memb ers holding the Second, Third, and Fourth Degrees, along with the Grand Master's Sixt h Degree. With the pooled knowledge of the years of experience of each member we form a sharp wedge for use in opening seemingly impenetrable shields of darkness. Dual Order Membership At first the question of membership in more than one Order was not given a great deal of attention by the various Grand Ma sters in the days when the Or ders were being formed. It became apparent the subject needed to be addressed as time progressed and membership grew. Setians initially could be members of the OTR and one other Order. In XXV the High Priest recommended that Initiates select one Orde r and work with that particular one. It is a wise recommendation, since dedicated work with an Order is on the lines of a college major. Holding two of these is a formidable demand for anyone. This is not to say tackling dual Magical majors is impossible. The O.L. has members who are also affiliated with the Orders of Merlin and the Vampyre. In each case the other Grand Master is contacted, and both Gr and Masters involved have satisfied themselves that the Initiate can successfully handle the part icular demands of the two Orders. As of XXVI the Order of Leviathan placed more emphasis on single Order affiliation, although it continued to honor the two-Order me mbership held by those with them, but strongly suggests to aspirants that they select a single major. The Order's stand from that time has been that no dual Order memberships are permitted. Orders exist to serve the Initiate in his or her special area of interest; they are not here to be collected for a hobby. Setians aspiring to the Order of Leviathan are always advised to contact each of the Temple's Orders for more detailed views of them. The Crystal Tablet of Set has sections covering the Orders and is a thorough source of knowledge ab out the Orders. If an Initiate has done his homework and come to the conclusion that the Order of Leviathan does fall in line with his particular interests and aspirati ons, his next step is to write a letter expressing this to the Grand Master. Each case is carefully exam ined and dialogue between Grand Master and aspirant takes place. There will be times when another Order will be recommended, and other times when the dialogue between the Order's l eader and the Initiate ma y be prolonged before admission is approved. When the la tter takes place it is to be certain that the Order of Leviathan is the best possible vehicle for personal Xeper. Great Expectations Classification: V2 - D14.04M - 2"},{"pageNumber":1302,"pageContent":" Part One: II° through IV° Why do Setians affiliate with the Order of Levi athan? For that matter, why enter any of the Orders? The answer lies in the attraction of a mutual suitability of the candidate and the particular Order. Each Grand Master has made clear and specific statements about his or her Order in The Crystal Tablet of Set , statements that articulate themselves in decided ways to certain members as they are expos ed to those statements. No two or more Initiates will read the same Order description in the same way, otherwise we would need only one Order. Some of our Temple of Set Initiates look on the Order of Leviathan and hear something within calling them. It seems to do so because of their personal aspira tions and expectations. Leviathan is the principle of continuity, of immortality; but all the Initiates I know have a more than passing interest in Indulging in the intense experi ence of Living a more than humdrum existence. If an aspirant expresses inte rest in affiliating with the Order of Leviathan he is making a statement. He is saying that there are teachings of th e Order which he feels would maximize his personal Xeper, and this go es beyond any superficial interest in hanging around for a long time on the planet. The expectations of the Order's members are as varied as there are members. You will recall that there are no deadlines members are required to meet, and no certain number of Rites to compose and perform per year. The basics wh ich members of the Order of Leviathan can expect are access to the Order's journals in their different forms ranging from The Book of Leviathan to The Trail of the Serpent to priority personal attenti on from the Grand Master. It is the Grand Master's conviction that Setians a ffiliate with an Order both to learn from it and to assist in its growth and development. Real izing this, the Order of Leviathan affiliate who requests his or her Grand Master's time and atte ntion will receive it. These journals spoke of above present a set of the best possible answers we have been able to come up with thus far for the contemporary world. It is from these that Initiates are able to ba se theories that are tried out in the Magical and mundane world. In other words, members receive a specialized set of tools, and from that point it is up to them to make the greatest possible use of them. No one is thrown out on his own after opening the bo x; the Grand Master is there to comment and advise along with other member s of the Order, who can be contacted for counsel based on their expertise. The expectations of those unde r the aegis of Leviathan are great ones and full not of the inconceivable, but of potential and promise. Part Two: VI° You have read in Part I of Great Expectations what the members of the Order of Leviathan can expect. Now, what does the Grand Master expect?

I have no plans for determining a specific magnum opus and on its attainment sending out an OL Letter saying thanks, folks, it's been great. Instead of that, our outlook is one of how splendid the adventure is. When I envision the Order of Leviathan in the future, I see a section of the Temple of Set dedicated to understanding the pot entials of a long distance down the road through the vehicle of having learned to shine our headlights just that distance -- a long way down the road. This is not to say we ignore the present moment, but that we appreciate both it and what will Remanifest itself along the Path. It is for this reason that the entries of The Book of Leviathan are carefully chosen to reflect the relevant obstacles of the Objective Universe and the successful overcoming of them. Looking down the road myself, I wonder now and then whether the Order would survive me - - a question which I hope will need addressing only many years from now. I would like to think that it will, not because of any partic ular thing revolving around my own personality, but because of its own merits, ones which I believe to be impressive and able to continue in viability. No Order is an ego trip for its Grand Master. We certainly feel a great deal of pride when our Initiates exhibit the gr eat and the good, just as we feel some sense of embarrassment if an affiliate turns about and begins knifing others. But these are a part of concern for the overall good, not building blocks fo r the Great and Wonderful Me. In the present moment I expect an atmosphere of dialogue within th e Order. I expect not slavery to the Order, but an intelligent a nd carefully balanced objective and subjective approach to and use of its teachings. For the most part I have not been disappointed. The Initiates of the Order of Leviathan have consiste ntly displayed mature and astute presences of the Self. Mind now, Order of Leviathan meetings are not assemblies of gloom and we all have an enjoyable time of both serious time and good-natured discourse when meeting -- any gathering of Order of Leviathan people, at Conc lave or otherwise, is proof enough of that. As in any other facet of Temple of Set life, anot her of my expectations is that Order affiliates will act in a manner befitting gentlemanly and ladylike people. We are human, no matter how exalted our insights or potent our Magics, a nd thereby can strengthen our individual Wills. Holbrook's Twain said that George Washington could not tell a lie, while he, Twain, could, but would not. Just so, we could sit back and benefit solely from the efforts of others, but will not. This determination to strive for th e good and great is a key to strength. Insofar as the Grand Master-to-member relati onship goes, I do not order any member to follow a routine schedule, although it helps to hear from Order of Leviathan people now and then with an account of their projects and t houghts. Adepti members of Orders who aspire to the Priesthood of Set know that their Grand Master s are perhaps the best ones to successfully assess their progress and evoluti on. This is as it should be sin ce Orders exist as specialized areas of study and experimentation, thereby bein g things headed by those who are Masters of their arts. Overall the entire matter of these great expect ations can be best summarized by remembering that the Grand Master still has a place in hi s heart for Thelema and therefore allows his Initiates to do what they Will.

What does this mean for the present and future days of the Order? What does it imply for these ground breakers? Obviously, having been named a Master of the Or der is not the same as being named a Master of the Temple, although there are some affin ities. The Magister Templi operates on a far broader scope than the Master of the Order. One of the indications of the presence of a Master of the Temple is observing an individual who more or less automatically acts in accord with the Current of the Aeon and the Will of Set. The Magister Templi does not sweat and strain to Understand; he simply does so. This, on an Order-oriented level, is what the Master of the Orde r does: he grasps the direction of the Order and acts in accord with its aims a nd goals to enhance them. He also intensifies first the environment of the Order, and next (a nd thereby) that of the Temple of Set. The Ipsissimus Aleister Crowley wrote his famous de scription of a Master of the Temple as one who tends the garden of Initiates. The similarity here is one of the automatic actions of the Master of the Order: he offers advice, comments, and acts in c oncert with the Grand Master's guidance and Understanding of th e Order in the Current of the Aeon. He also does this to a certain degree without straining his Magical and intelle ctual abilities. Insofar as the O.L. proper goes, the Master of the Order has prerogatives which are parallel in a sense to his Priestly and Magisterial ones as applicable. The Mast er of the Order of Leviathan has an active hand in steering the direc tion the Order will take in the future. He is able to assess the state of others worki ng under the aegis of Leviathan and can bring recommendations when other candidates for Master of the Order arise. This, I might point out, is a privilege which will be exercised unde r special circumstances and after careful examination of the matter at hand.

Leviathan is that aspect of Set which is timeless, thereby being the developed quality wh ich gives the Lord of Darkness agelessness. All things revolve around the absolute. For the Master of the Order this opens the door to new and strange worlds, since he is able to partake of this quality through his understanding. If the Order is thought of as a vehicle such as a tardis , the Master of the Or der is at home with the control console and is sensitive to changes in its functioning, movements, and even slight alterations in the rise and fall of the centr al column. He is a ma ster diagnostician and technician. He is also capable of piloting the vehicl e on his own within certain limitations. As an analyst his powers are formidable, and while he is willing to give of his time and understanding, his precision of insight makes him a rather difficult individual to outmaneuver. He retains his Priestly prerogatives of Recogn ition and is able to appraise First and Second Degree Initiates for Recognitions in accord with his own current Degree's rights. I bring this up because the abilities of the Master of the Orde r are also able to evaluate requests for entry into the O.L. and how well the Initiate aspiring to affiliation may be able to benefit from such an association, again remembering that none of us have what the High Priest recently referred to as Antipapal infallibility. What we do is hope for the best possible outcome. None of this is set in concrete, and it all will be subject to change as we become more familiar with the concept of having Masters of the Order. Who will decide who becomes a Master of the Order? At this point, I make the decision as Grand Master, although I am open to feedback on the subject. I think O.L. Initiates are comfortable with the knowledge that there are no forbidden In itiatory related subjects under Leviathan's banner and so if questions aris e, the address is Post Office Box 527, Alma, Georgia, 31510, USA along with the electronic addresses. We probably will be discussing the Master of the Order later in both private correspondences and in O.L. Letters as indicated. I am sure the Master s of the Order may also have some comments themselves, again to be shared in e ither private correspondences or other means. Footnotes 1.

As well \"it\" can be a condition, a set of conditions, or a state of being . It is an intel ligent, non-natural phenomenon, and many of its attendant qualities parallel those which Setians recognize as emanating from their higher Selves. As impe rfections in the human condition die and give way to more noble attributes, both the Setian and the Vampyre Become. Like man -- or, more precisely, like Elect man, the Vampyre is a du al-natured being. While its lower or more mundane aspects are epitomized by the were-bei ng, our lower aspects are demonstrated in our own animal nature. Each of these two major aspects holds its respective significance to the entity as a whole, be it a Setian, a Vampyre, or a composite thereof. A common yet vital realization that both Setians and Vampyric beings share is that of knowing they are alone. The Vampyre is a my sterious creature, long thought to possess arcane powers. Of one of these -- the power of invisibility -- it is now necessary to speak. Were we to replace the word \"invisible\" with \"unseen,\" we would ha ve a clearer conception of what this means. Call it \"social respectabili ty\" in one of its form s, or \"manipulation\" (through Lesser Black Magic) in ye t a different form, both Setians and Vampyric entities have the ability to Become unseen. And we may do this as an option, in a myriad of forms, at our discretion and Will. Those who would be as th e ancient Vampyre, would also be those who would utilize to the fullest the art of glamour and the act of persuasion. Setians are dignified and respected magicians. Add to this our capab ility of using cosmetics, facial expressions, voice techniques, eye contact, and other such devices, and you ha ve a more compleat Being: one that may compel or repulse at its leisure ... one in whic h people recognize that \"X\"tra something, yet cannot comprehend it. The accomplished Black Magicians who would utilize the Order of the Vampyre as a special ingredient in their personal Temple of Set menus will also be those who are among the true Children of the Night. The Order of the Vampyre (OV) is an Order wh ich will take the concepts of Essence, the Force, and Immortality and Work with them that they may Become personal actualization. \"The Blood is the Life\" will be more than just a catch-phrase; for OV members it will be an edict. Using the Word of Set's Aeon, Xeper, as a fulcrum and as the original starting point, Setians who are members of this Order will breath e Life into what was formerly considered to be undead. The OV derives its impetus for bei ng from the Prince of Darkness and from his Gift to us: the great Black Magic. Members of this Order will return portions of their discoveries and essence to Set and his collect ive Aeon. Aims, goals, and objectives of the Order shall be directed by the tw o Grand Masters. Yet the input for the same will arrive from all members of the Order. While looking at the greater issues of initia tion as a whole, the OV will apply its special talents in order to secure its goals. Were there to be one reason that might typify why an Order such as this has emerged within the context of Set's sacred Temple, it would have to revolve around the need of Set's Elect first to accomplish the Great Work, then to define what is beyond. The OV will be a vehicle within a vehicle, and one in which the Setian may actualize his or her potentia l to Become in the special ways of the Order. Communication will be a cornerst one of the Order of the Vampyre. We will not be measuring your output, as members of the Order, in terms of quantity. Rather we will want to know that you can communicate effectively. Whether subtle and magical or obvious and earthy, we will expect that once we have established a rappor t with you, it will be a consistent one, and one that bespeaks mutual respect. As the Order e volves, we may decide to produce a publication."},{"pageNumber":1308,"pageContent":"If so, it will be periodic, and the material for it will come from our ideas, discoveries, and truths -- and yours as well. Presently the OV is researching th e characteristics of the Vampyr ic (state of) Being. This is being accomplished through reading, intuitive explor ations, and ritual. Titles of books such as Interview with the Vampire and Dracula have already, in effect, acted as predecessors for this Order and its Work yet to come. And the sty lish writings of H.P. Lovecraft are among those that cannot be ignored as tools for visualizations. Such music as is presently considered to be \"Vampyric\" by the Grand Masters includes Albinoni's Adagio , (which, is included on the album Greatest Hits of 1720 ) and Leonard Roseman's Helm's Deep . There are of course others, but th e above two succinctly capture both aspects of the Vampyric Being. The Order will have the distinctive emblem of the Vampyre Bat. This will be made available to members at a nominal cost, which w ill cover materials and production only. Working in concert with members, the Grand Ma sters will develop spec ific rituals and/or ceremonies for the Order. What is to come -- or Become -- as the Order evolves shall be a matter for all members of the OV to Work on. The Order of the Vampyre will accept applications for membership from any active II° or III° Setian. As in other specialized IV° Orders, all IV °+ Setians shall be members of Honor of the Order of the Vampyre. Setians I° are invited to query either Grand Ma ster concerning specific aspects of the Order and/or the Vampyric Be ing, but may not apply for membership. The only exceptions to this rule that might be made w ill be dealt with when/if they arise, and will require agreement by both Grand Masters once they have studied th e case in question. Before applying to the OV for admission, we ask th at you consider carefully the statements of the other Orders in the Crystal and Ruby Tablets . When you have made y our decision, and if you do wish to apply for admission to the Order of the Vampyre, please contact either Grand Master in writing at the addr ess found in the Crystal Tablet . State your interests and reasons for wishing admission. Also please send a copy of your letter to the other Grand Master for his/her information.

Lilith Aquino Astrum Argenteum: Prospectus Classification: V1 - D14.AA - 1 Author: Michael A. Aquino VI°"},{"pageNumber":1309,"pageContent":" Within the Temple of Set there are several sp ecialized Orders, each presided over by a Master of the Temple who serves as Grand Master of that Order. Each Order pursues different magical and philosophical interest s, yet is responsible to the Temple and makes the fruits of its research freely available to all Setians. This prospectus addresses the creation of a new such Order: the Astrum Argenteum or AA. The purpose of this Order will be to develop and implement an initiatory system based upon the Essence of the Aeon of Horus. This system will be distinct from that of the Temple of Set, but will possess certain complementary links with it. In this undertaking the AA will be guided first by myself, per the authority vested in me by the Book of Coming Forth by Night and the Book of the Law , and by virtue of my trans- Aeonic perspective as an Ipsissimus. As it begins to mature, it will be entrusted to the care of a qualified Adept or Master of the Temple (AA). At such time as it appears sufficiently strong and self-reliant, this Order will be released from allegiance to the Temple of Set, and will then develop as an independent initiatory institution. Several features will distinguish this AA from the original A :. A :. created by Aleister Crowley, from the various organizations wh ich claim succession to that original A :. A :. , and from other Crowley-related organizations such as the O.T.O. Characteristics of this new AA include (but are not lim ited to) the following: (1) Central to it is the quest for the awakening, apprehension, and glorification of the Great Horus, neter of the Light of the Universe, S un of Suns, Brother to Set who with him brought existence out of nothingness. The AA will thus seek reconsecration of the ancient Priesthood of Horus. Until and unless this is attained in truth, as Recogni zed by the Priesthood of Set, the AA will remain an initiatory Order which does not incorporate the Priesthood of Horus within its degree structure. (2) The philosophy and legacy of the founding Magus of the Aeon of Horus will be studied, refined, and applied as appropriate. These w ill be considered points of departure, not enshrined dogma. The name and dignity of Alei ster Crowley, founder of the Order, will be preserved and honored. The concepts and conduct of Crowley apart from his historic Task as an Aeonic Magus will be evaluated fairly and dispassionately, and will not be automatically considered part of that legacy. (3) Corruptions of the legacy of Horus will not exist within the AA. The superstitions of decadent cultures, such as the Hebrew and Greek \"Cabalas,\" will not be a part of this Order, nor will it welcome or tolerate crude pagani sms (such as Wicca) or insincere, pseudo- Egyptian games (such as the AMORC). The gr ade system based upon th e Hebrew \"tree of life,\" and adapted from the doctrinally-corrupt Golden Dawn, will be replaced by a non-sex- based degree system whose levels of Recogn ition indicate meaningful personal initiatory states of being and Aeonic consequence. Date: May 15, XXII HTML Revision: N ov. 10, 1998 CE Subject: Aeon of Horus Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1310,"pageContent":"(4) The AA advances no claim to any assets or co mmercial enterprise of the estate of Aleister Crowley. It shall not engage in any commercial ventures what soever, publishing or otherwise. Its services shall be solely for the benefit of its own Initiates, and to all Initiates of the Temple of Set so long as it shall remain an Order within that Temple. (5) All structures, officers, and procedures of the AA shall be openly a nd officially recorded, and shall be made known to Initiates of the Or der and the Temple unless there is an explicit reason for not doing so. All policies and procedures of the AA during its pe riod as an Order of the Temple of Set shall be in accordance with, and subordinate to the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Temple. (6) The AA will respect the existence of othe r organizations, such as the O.T.O., which pursue in their own way the lore and legacy of Aleister Crowley. It will aid them as it may, but will remain uncompromising in its own, unique ly sacred identity. It will seek to set a positive standard by its example, and will concer n itself with other Aeon of Horus activities, individuals, or organizations onl y when there is a clearly cons tructive purpose in doing so. Courtesy befitting the legacy of Horus will be observed in all such interactions. (7) The name \"Astrum Argenteum\" (Silver Star) will be retained as a tradition of the Aeon of Horus. However the seal originally designed by Aleister Crowley will be replaced with the concentric/geometric AA seal shown in this document, and the initials \"AA\" will be used without the Masonic \"pyr amid of fire\" dots ( :. ) employed by Crowley in imitation of the Golden Dawn and earlier Masonic/Rosicrucian bodies. In addition to incorporating two stylized \"A\"s, the new symbol represents the triangular glyph of the Great Horus and suggests the continuous vortex of the Aeon of Horus. (8) The AA shall function as a non-profit Order while it is within the Temple of Set, and its eventual release by the Temple of Set sha ll be conditional upon its formal, non-profit incorporation. It may designate donations for se rvices provided, but there shall be no fees connected with degree initiations, nor shall dues or fees vary for Initiates of different degrees or offices. (9) While the AA shall not deny the beauty or di gnity of human sexuality in all of its mature and responsible forms of expression, fetishistic \"sex magick\" shall no t be a part of its curriculum. The use of illegal drugs shall be prohibited, and the abuse of legal drugs discouraged. The human body shall be considered th e material shrine of the soul, hence shall not be profaned or desecrated. In this AA will be reconstituted the pure Form of that which, since the decay of ancient Egypt, mankind has sought through a variety of crude ly-conceptualized and superstition-laden religions: the alignment of the human physical existence to the sublime symphony of the physical universe. The AA will thus restore, fo r enlightened humanity, the true Right-Hand Path to initiation. With this pur ification, the re vulsion which Initiates of the Left-Hand Path have felt for \"RHP\" profanations, such as conventional and neopagan religions, will disappear. Replacing it will be a divine synthesis of the human experience, to the eternal glory of Set and Horus. \"There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnight is ever the son.\""},{"pageNumber":1311,"pageContent":"Initiatory Degree Structure Initially the AA will undergo a thorough and remo rseless \"housecleaning\" of what, in the original A :. A :. , was a hopelessly corrupt and inconsis tent hierarchy of \"grades.\" A true initiatory system should inco rporate an objective standard of measurement by which one's progress may be Recognized and formalized. Such a system has been created and refined by the Church of Satan and Temple of Set over the last two decades, and an appropriately modified version of it will be introduced into the AA: The old elevenfold degree structure of the A :. A :. was adapted from that of the Golden Dawn, aligned to the Sephiroth of the Hebrew Cabala \"tree of life, \" and divided into three \"orders\": the Golden Dawn (Probationer through Philosophus), the Rosy Cross (Adeptus Minor through Adeptus Exemptus), and the Silver Star (Magister Templi through Ipsissimus). In the new AA, the three \"orders\" will be elimin ated in favor of a single initiatory structure defined in terms of degrees (of initiation), not \"grades.\" The \"tree of life\"-based circles and squares will be replaced by the degree symbol (°). The old \"training grades\" (Probationer thr ough Philosophus) will be replaced by a single student degree: Neophyte I°. (This name was se lected from among the original \"training grade\" names as the most signifi cant and historic, in both its G :. D :. and A :. A :. derivations.) Unlike the old A :. A :. grade-curriculum set forth in \"One St ar in Sight\", an aspirant to the AA shall not be expected to study a hodge-podge of Hindu, Hebrew, and Rosicrucian/Masonic mummery. Instead the Neophyte shall be expos ed to, and encouraged to discuss and experiment with, the principles of the Aeon of Horus in their most refi ned and precise sense. Via this exposure, the Neophyte may then make an informed decision whether to pursue Adeptship or to depart from the AA. The old \"Rosicrucian Grades\" (Adeptus Mino r through Adeptus Exemptus) will be replaced by the single degree of Adept (based upon the principle that one either is or is not Adept). It shall be characterized by a sophisticated inte llectual familiarity with the philosophy of the Aeon of Horus, and by demonstrated fluenc y in its techniques of applied magic. The \"bridging grades\" of Dominus Liminis and Babe of the Abyss sh all be eliminated. The three highest grades of Master of the Temp le, Magus, and Ipsissimus shall be retained as degrees, and shall be interpreted in the same ri gorous, advanced sense as those degrees within the Temple of Set. Between the degrees of Adept and Master of th e Temple shall be designated a third degree -- that of Priest of Horus. Until and unless activation of this sacr ed office is Recognized by the High Priest of Set to have been ordained by Horus, the degree of Adept II° shall be the highest attainable in the AA. Until the restoration of the Priesthood of Horu s III°, Recognition of Neophytes I° to Adept II° shall be reserved to Masters of the Temple of Set IV°. Upon the rest oration of the Priesthood of Horus, II° AA Recognition shal l become their prerogative."},{"pageNumber":1312,"pageContent":"Recognition of Masters of the Temple IV° AA sha ll initially be by the High Priest of Set, and then, upon the restoration of the Priesthood of Horus, by the High Priest of Horus (who will necessarily hold the IV°+ AA). As with the Priesthood of Set, the Priesthood of Ho rus will be approached in the most literal, sacred sense. For purposes of purely personal education, Recognition as an Adept II° will be the culmination of one's progress. The III° will not be attainable by mere personal prowess, but will rather formalize the sanctification of the individual by Horus as his Priest or Priestess. While it will be possible for a si ngle individual to be an Adept II° of the Temple of Set and an Adept II° AA, therefore, the Priesthoods of Set and Horus cannot both be held simultaneously. The degree of Master of the Temple IV° shall not symbolize, as Crowley portrayed it, the destruction and absorption of the self into the inertia of the universe. Rather the degree shall represent, as it does in the Temple of Set, the expansion of the self-consci ousness to embrace the entire current of the Aeon of Horus. If the Priesthood III° may be compared to a lens through which the Being and Will of Horus are fo cused, the degree of Master of the Temple may be compared to a prism in which that focused beam is diffused through its entire \"spectrum.\" What of the degree of Magus V° AA? Aleister Crowley prophetically provided for others besides himself to attain this level of initiati on within the Aeon of Horus, and the very essence of that initiation explains how this may be so. The Magus is an Utteror of Words -- or, to put it another way, a conceptualizer and proposer of new definitions. A true Magus V° AA will thus be a Master of the Temple who accepts the Task of redefining the Aeon of Horus and the Curse of undertaking this Task amidst the inertia of preexisting concepts of the Aeon. This current reconstitutio n and purification of the initiatory environment of the AA is not such a \"Task of a Magus.\" These represent rather th e subtle intrusion of an Ipsissimus into the Aeon of Horus, to make the necessary adjustments that it may in time bring forth its Masters and Magi. Having made such adjustments, an Ipsissimus returns to trans-Aeonic contemplation, and to the encouragement and e nhancement of the Work of the Priesthoods, Masters, and Magi of the Aeons. A true initiatory system measures neither cas te, nor seniority, nor social privilege, nor political prerogative. It is central and cri tical to any magical philosophy of progressive sophistication and refinement, but it is most ef fective when it is employed as a \"mirror\" of one's progress along the Left- or Right-Hand Path -- not a means by which artificial images of such progress may be produced. It is for this reason that the Temple of Set speaks of degree Recognition in individuals -- not of bestowal or awarding. The initiatory degree system of the AA will reflect this same principle.

[Decompression: The Seventh Symphony , approximately 7 minutes] * * * *"},{"pageNumber":1319,"pageContent":"Rationale for the Musical Selections The Seventh Symphony of Beethoven carries the plodding rh ythm of the m echanics of the objective, unconscious universe, while the pr esence of the self-aware potential superman weaves delicately in a minor key. While Beethoven's attempt may have been othe rwise, this theme carries the bitter-sweet reminder of Death in Life, of HarWer, and the Universe we live in now. I see this theme for compression an attempt to convey the importance of the Task: Xeper. As decompression, it serves to transmit the G.B. M. effects back into the universe. Also Sprach Zarathustra echoes both the voice of Nietzsch e's Superman and the fundamental theme of 2001: A Space Odyssey . The first three dramatic risi ng tones cue the tolling of the bell (through its three-times equals nine), a nd the topping two-tone in rapid sequence again completes the five points of the Great Pentagram. Of course, the 2001 metaphor of alien intervention to gran t the gift of intelligence, the Gift of Set, has already been treated by the High Priest elsewhere. The visual associations for Pylon members from the film include the global pers pectives from space (a deidentified posture), and should lend to the power of Agreement in this operation. Selections from the movie score of Close Encounters of the Third Kind were made for a variety of reasons. First, the overall theme of the film (particularly if seen by th e pylon participants) is that of contact and communication with alien consciousness of superior inte llect and technology (remember Clarke's Law about sufficiently ad vanced technology always being magic for the less advanced culture). The movie reviews for Close Encounters in the Scroll of Set some years ago supports the validity of this theme. The Abduction of Barry is perhaps some of the most ghos tly and powerful music I have heard, and simply seems to me to serve as prope r support for the Invocation of the Prince of Darkness. In the film, this was the taking of the innocent child (mind) by the aliens, away from his non-understanding (unconscious) mother (HarWer) to the Heart of the Mystery. The Appearance of the Visitors also begins with power and fear , and then turns to a version of When You Wish Upon a Star . Timing this to the summoning of the Elements and transitioning to the focus upon the Great Pentagram (Star) with the three goals (personal, pylon, temple) in mind, seems well suited. The major Globa l Pylon Connection takes place here. The Resolution leads inexorably to the 5-tone co mmunication theme of Close Encounters . Each of the five tones flash from each of the points of the Pentagram, in a counter-clockwise circular affair (I still flood with tears from this Connecti on, which is tota lly unlike any experience I have ever had in occult matters). Rationale for the Selection of Elements for Summoning The drawing of the four Elements through the slightly more traditi onal Satanic Forms of Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan is intended to cover the four dire ctions of the compass"},{"pageNumber":1320,"pageContent":"without concern for physically f acing a certain direction. Those south of the Earth's equator will probably be grateful for this! Concluding with Leviathan as Dr agon was made for several reasons. First, this was the order established in the Satanic Bible , and out of respect for Anton LaVey I maintained it here. Second, the Dragon contains within the whole of his Being the full four Elements (Fire of breath, Air of wings, Water of Leviathan's Serpent, and Earth of the secretly guarded treasure, the dark elixir of Truth's Grail). Finally, out of respect for the new Magus of the Order of the Leviathan, whose Magical name is Orm, th e Dragon, I completed the summoning with his symbol. Again, the theme of the Gates of Hell (the Gr eat Pentagram) is completed by the previous Invocation of Set, the Fifth Direction, to form the Eye of Set in the c onstellation of the Thigh. By having each pylon member perform the Opera tion at midnight in their own time zone, we can accomplish three goals: 1) The special orientati on of the participants to the Eye of Set will all be close to exactly the same. 2) We will m eet the injunction of Set to \"speak to me at night\" from the BoCFbN . 3) We will probably meet the scheduling needs of more pylon members by having a late night Operation, rather than attempt a global synchronous Operation so that some would be in the noon-day sun!

While listening back to the recording I made of the Working, I noticed tones that I had not produced with any of my equipment or voice. These were long, deep, resonant tones which occurred in various places. The most distinct of these occurred just before and during the Protection Rite portion. As a side note only: On the following morning I proceeded to my car to leave for work, and discovered that the odometer reading was at ex actly 21666 (21 being the number of characters in my own Cthulhuvian/Yuggothic Glyph system, and the relevance of 666 is fairly obvious). After ending the Working, sleep was attained onl y after a long period of time, and this was interrupted a number of times dur ing the night. Why, I don't know. One impression I received immediately followi ng the end of my Working was one of someone looking for me as if I had lost my way somewhere and was unable to meet them."},{"pageNumber":1330,"pageContent":"This caused some degree of discomfort to me, for I felt as if I'd failed in some way in reaching my objective. The overall feeling was one of success, especially with regard to the Protection Rite for Adept/Sentinel Bozeman and other Setians in th e Persian Gulf area. It had been announced earlier in the day that there had been a cease fire, and that the war with Iraq was nearly finished. This was very reassuring, as I felt th at Clayton and other Setians were safe and would be returning to us very soon. The big question at this point is, \"Was the Me talink successful for the other participants?\" I did have some impressions of presences other th an myself within the chambre, but these were not as strong as I might have hoped for them to be. Again, I must question whether I actually accomplished what I set out to do. The recording that I made of the Working was a last minute idea, so the quality is substandard to what I'm used to.

Adept Grise performed the Consecration of the Cave, and read the First and Twelfth Parts of the Word of Set.

Occultism has always been torn between a retreat into ancient customs, beliefs, and principles on one hand, and an advance into the limits of experimental philosophy, art, and science on the other. Salem dramatizes this . Its relevance to the Black Arts is purely and simply that it was where a group of primitive and superstitious people massacred some of their own kind due to a mistake. Today the city, somewhat confusedly, is trying to commemorate that event in th e belief that, whether or not it is something to be proud of, at least it is something to be famous for. Salem, in other words, wants to be remembered for something. The Temple of Set also wants to be remembered for something, although our goals are somewhat higher than Salem's. We want to be remembered as an institut ion which sought out the most excellent quality in humanity - that element which takes it beyond nature - and which has sought every avenue to express, explore, and remanifest it. Our own reverence for the great civilizations and great magicians of history is not based on mere superstition, but rather on the realizatio n that some of them were interested in this very same goal - they saw with eyesight very much like our own. And some of them did a very good job of pursuing that goal, such that we can learn much from them if we take the time to find out what they did. We are not the Eloi of H.G. Wells, content to play amidst modern comforts while the records of ancient wisdom rot in neglected libraries. The present environment is, of course, a two- edged sword. Technological resources have never been more efficient or accessible, and the Temple of Set is hurrying - or at least making haste slowly! - to make use of them. On the other hand, human social problems have never been worse, as we can see every day by the continued fragmentation and disi ntegration of what were once considered solid societies.

We have virtually re- defined what it is to be an enlightened human being, and we have done this so successfully as to communicate this knowledge to persons from many different cultures and personal backgrounds. The question is no longer whether we can do this at all - it is simply how we can continue to do it better. Set-13 is about this question, and, like all of our past Conclaves, the ripples from it will improve the character of the entire Temple, and of the AEon of Set in its entirety, for a very long time to come. My very best wishes to all of you as we continue on this great adventure.

Ruby Tablet Order Form Instructions Step 1: Examine the set of options listed below. You may order the complete Ruby Tablet of Set , the \"basic\" Tablet, any combination of volumes within the Tablet, and/or one or more update sets within the Tablet. Mark the spaces indicating which item(s) you wish to order. 1____ To order the entire Ruby Tablet of Set , mark this space. Do not mark any other space. 2____ To order the entire \"basic\" Ruby Tablet of Set (Volumes I and II), but not all of the Tablet, mark this space. You may want to mark other spaces below for additional items of interest. 3____ To order all of Volume III of the Ruby Tablet of Set , Gems from the Trail , mark this space. Note: Gems from the Trail is a collection of gems (the best articles) from Trail of the Serpent , the newsletter of the Order of Leviathan. It is available in six volumes at this time. It has already been distributed to all members of the Order of Leviatha n. If you already have part of Gems , you may choose to order individual volumes within Gems by marking the appropriate spaces below: 3a___ To order Vol. 1 of \"Gems from th e Trail\", XIV-XXIII, mark this space. 3b___ To order Vol. 2 of \"Gems from the Trail\", year XXIV, mark this space. 3c___ To order Vol. 3 of \"Gems from the Trail\", year XXV, mark this space. 3d___ To order Vol. 4 of \"Gems from the Trail\", year XXVI, mark this space. 3e___ To order Vol. 5 of \"Gems from the Trail\", year XXVII, mark this space. 3f___ To order Vol. 6 of \"Gems from the Trail\", year XXVIII, mark this space.

Volume IV contains those items which are considered to be of probable interest to most Setians, but which aren't \"basic\" or \"primary\" enough to require placement in the \"basic\" Tabl et (volume II). These can be considered similar to level-4 of the Reading List. 5____ To order Volume V of the Ruby Tablet of Set , the \"reference and archival\" section of the Tablet, mark this space. Volume V contains mostly those items which have been moved from volume II be cause they have become \"dated\", and also contains some material from outside sources which might be of interest but don't qualify for inclusion in volume II. It is very possible that at some point in the future items within volume V will be available individually, but that option is not yet available.

"},{"pageNumber":1354,"pageContent":"The Thirteenth Commandment: Privacy [This is a highly important part of being in the O.L. or any Order. The respect for the privacy of others is a reflection of the amount of respect present both for the other Initiate and one's own self as well. I cannot stress this strongly enough after having seen more than one disaster come about from one or another busybody at work.] Many an Initiate has heard me refer to the Thirteenth Commandment. It reads, \"Thou shalt mind thy own business.\" The Eleventh and Twelfth are identical to the Thirteenth. Setians, as you have noted in yourself and others, are unique and strong in both personality and presence of Self . For this reason they are also fascinating individuals who find others drawn to them for many a reason. We do still have some basically human characteristics, and often find ourselves quite interested in the others of our kind. Just as each of us appreciate the value of the Self on a personal basis, we also prize our personal Magical and self-with-self times as well. The Order of Leviathan has an inflexible, vigorous, explicit, emphatic poli cy on personal privacy. The Grand Master will ask no Initiate/aspirant questions of a personal nature except in such rare cases as might arise through individualized situations. [This has happened so rarely over the years that the sum of the times could not exceed two.] The other side of the coin is that while the Grand Master respects your personal privacy, you are expected to repay in like currency. This is the gentlemanly and ladylike thing to do; not to do so rightfully brands the individual as a busybody. Where does respect for the individual end and prying begin? You are adult enough to know if you are reading this. If in some doubt and planning to take a chance and find out more, be aware that some Initiates will tactfully turn aside a question which is not relevant while others may bluntly advise the questioner to mind his or her own business. In other words, you are free to make any move you wish in the Temple of Set, but also you must be prepared to take responsibility for those actions. Setians tend to trust other Setians, and rarely is this trust abused. You will find members of the Order of Leviathan being very open in their thoughts and opinions; this is not an invitation to trivia, but to dialogue.

This is the message I was give n to relate to you and all th e Priesthood and Elect of the Temple of Set! I had a very definite feeling for two days before the ritual that we would be given a message of import, and the atmosphere beca me more tangible with the reality and urgency of the message as the hours drew ne arer to the actual time of the Rite. I felt it so very strongly, I wanted to call you and ask you to focus on it during the ritual. I tried several times all evening, and once at the House of Healing. I wasn't worried when I didn't reach you, but I felt a strong need to contact you. I called Adept Bettye Fisher, thinking that maybe you went down there, and told her how I felt. She told me that she also had an intense feeling for the past two days that something was about to happen. She offered to call your mother, for which I wa s grateful because we both felt it was important. I called the Huddlestons a few minutes after 11:00 pm. We were glad for the opportunity to talk, because they also felt a distinct cha nge and that the ritual we were about to do was important. They had unusual happenings there last evening. I told Tom about how I felt and my need to contact you. I told him I wasn't alarmed, but I was concerned. He told me he would concentrate on this during the ritual, play it by ear, and if he had some manifestation, he would try to reach you and/or me after the ritual. I agreed to do the same. When Colleen got on the phone, almost the fi rst words she spoke were, \"The Temple of Set has changed!\" I told her that this is what I felt in the sense that we have reached a higher level. We spoke for a short time because each of us had last-minute preparations for the ritual. You are aware that I've been wanting something to happen for a long time. I have known that Set has a good reason or more for not letting it happen as instantly as I wanted it to happen. As Set tells us in the Book of Coming Forth by Night , he \"sees with our eyes.\" He really does, Jim, but we must listen and Xeper and listen and see with Set's eyes.

[Drink from Chalice.] [First Assistant:] In the beginning was there nothing, and the nothing was whole. [Second Assistant:] And though the nothing was whole, it came together to form substance, which was both matter and energy. [First Assistant:] And this substance, apart from the chaos of nothing, became mechanically ordered; but it could not create. [Celebrant:] And with the formation of this substance was formed a force, at once distinct from the cosmic inertia and driven by it. And while all moved, all was stagnant and did not progress. Suddenly this force began to glimmer, and its awakening began, and through countless ages its intelligence sparked and became great. And it soon re alized that it was separate from the cosmic order, and saw the need to cr eate its opposite that it might define itself. And this force called itself Set, and its opposi te HarWer.

And these followed the teachers of death-worship, though evidence of their created gods did not exist. And Set looked with bewilderment and sorrow upon the Earth, for man, whom he had taught to see with more than his eyes, had fo rsaken his Gift and learned to despise him. And Set turned from the Earth and determined to go elsewhere; for truly, he thought, his great experiment had failed, and he was much weakened by it and feared that he might cease to exist. And for many ages the death-worshippers and their myriads of created gods ruled the Earth. [First Assistant:] And they fought amongst themselves, though their gods were the same; for each was touched by greed, ignorance, and stupidity. [Celebrant:] But the Elect of Set did not cease to exist, though their bodies were destroyed; for in the dark regions of the minds of some of the blind followers of the death-gods there existed an instinctive knowledge of the truth and the splendor that was Set. [First Assistant:] In the common year nineteen hundred and four, in the land of Egypt, was given unto Aleister Crowley the Book of the Law . And its author was HarWer, though the Magus of the Aeon perceived this but dimly. And with this book came into being the Aeon of HarWer. [Celebrant:] The Magus of the Aeon was ever tinged with the defects of the death-gods, and proclaimed the Aeon imperfectly as that of Horus. And the Aeon was ever tainted with the irrationality of HarWer and its Magus. In the common year nineteen hundred and sixty-six, Set again prepared to visit mankind, for he perceived that the time was dawning when man might be free of the harbingers of death. And he fused with HarWer to better close the Aeon and usher in the Aeon of Set. And this time was called the Age of Satan, because even the minds of the emerging Elect were touched with the myths of the death-cults. In the year X of the Age of Satan, when some of the Elect had come forth and been identified, Set determined to bring to a clos e the age of transition and to establish his Aeon.

The st ory behind its Coming into Being is communicated to all who receive it in evidence of their recognition by the Temple of Set. On March 18, 1904 CE, Aleister Crowley visi ted the Boulak Museum in Cairo with his wife Rose. She drew his attention to an old monument of the XXVI Dynasty -- the funeral stele of the Theban priest Ankh-f-n -Khonsu. Represented on this stele are three Egyptian god-figures, which Crowley identifi ed as Nuit, Had(it), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Later, when setting down the Book of the Law on April 8, 9, and 10 of that same year, Crowley associated each of its three chapters with one of the god-figures from the stele, which he subsequently referred to as the Stele of Revealing. (2) "},{"pageNumber":1362,"pageContent":" Stele of Revealing (obverse) Aleister Crowley's inability to see beyond the Aeon of HarWer to the Aeon of Set is evident from his limited understanding of the Stele of Revealing. He thought Ra-Hoor- Kuit to be a manifestation of Horus the Younge r, son of Osiris and Isis, and thus symbol of an \"aeon of the son\" to follow those of the mother-goddess and father-god. Had or Hadit was \"Heru-pa-kraath\" (Harpocrates = th e infant Horus), and the complement to the limitless extension of Nuit. (3) Since the Stele of Revealing seemed so definitely within the Osirian Cult, then, I paid little attention to it when considering the magical and philosophical mandates of the Temple of Set. As it turned out, this was an erroneous judgment."},{"pageNumber":1364,"pageContent":"Stele of Revealing (reverse) During the period of July -- October X, Lynn A. Norton, William F. Murray, and I spent considerable time and effort attempting to de sign an initiatory certificate for the Temple of Set. Other projects associated with the Coming Into Being of the Temple of Set had \"fallen into place\" with uncanny precision, bu t in this case we encountered a series of difficulties with typeface, text, format , and reproduction. Something was \"wrong\". In frustration, I turned to another project, in volving the heritage and role of Set in ancient Egypt. Perhaps the problems with the certificate could be worked out later. Opening H. Te Velde's Seth, God of Confusion, I came ac ross a photograph of a stele in the Oriental Institute of Chicago (#10510). I was immediately struck by its marked resemblance to the Stele of Revealing, the essential differences being that the figure of Set replaced that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit and that Hadit possessed only one wing -- the other being replaced by the Right Eye of Ra (the sun). (4) Now intrigued, I took out Volume AL and leafed through the Hadit-chapter. My eye fell on Verse #51: \"Purple beyond purple; it is the light higher than eyesight.\" And then on Crowley's own footnote to this verse: \"There is a certain suggestion in this 'purple' as connected with 'eyesight', which should reveal a certain identity of Hadit with the Dwarf- Soul to those who possess -- eyesight!\" (5) The implied link between the V° of the Temple of Set and a \"certain identity\" of Hadit sparked my curiosity. I decided to look at the word abrahadabra , which Crowley had termed the Magical Formula of the Aeon of Horus. Like the Formula of the Aeon of Set (XXX), it could be separated into three units: Abra had abra . The central unit, as Crowley himself noted, identified Had/Hadit. Crowley did not consider the other two units, but in Egyptian they translate to \"Heart of Ra\" or \"Purification of Ra\". Very interesting -- particularly in view of the Eye of Ra by the Had-figure on the Stele of Set."},{"pageNumber":1365,"pageContent":" Stele of Set A close look at the hieroglyphics directly beneath the Had-figure on the Stele of Revealing: They translate to Behdety -- not Had or Hadit. This suddenly made sense. In Egyptian lore there is no god named Had/Hadit, but there is a Behdety. It was a form of Horus the Elder (HarWer) worshipped in the eastern Delta at Behdet. The Stele of Revealing was beginning to look somewhat less Osirian! I translated the two vertical lines of hieroglyphs by the figure of \"Ra-Hoor-Khuit\", and came up with Ra-Harakhte Master of the Gods . Yet another form of HarWer, literally \"Hor of the Horizon\" in his solar aspect of Xepera . Ra-Harakhte had been the judge of the dead in pre-Osirian Egypt, and he had been the champion of Set in the Osirian trial between Set and Horus the Younger. (6) "},{"pageNumber":1366,"pageContent":"And so the Stele of Revealing had been revealed -- by recourse to the Stele of Set and the deciphering of Abrahadabra . The Stele of Revealing was no t of the Osiris Cult, and its orientation is in keeping with the Book of Coming Forth by Night . There should, it seemed to me, be a way to commemorate this discovery in view of its implications for the Temple of Set. And thus there Came Into Being the Stele of Xeper, which portrays the Aeon of Set as did the Stele of Revealing the Aeon of HarWer. Following is a description of the Stele of Xeper [see the sample below]. Shown at left is Xepera. (7) With one hand he indicates the Pentagram of Set; with the other three ascending hieroglyphs for the apes, mankind, and divine persons -- the evolution of the Elect. Enthroned at right is Set, holding the Ankh of Life and the Tcham- sceptre (incorporating the head and forked tail of the Set-animal). (8) It is this sceptre which signifies the Guardianship of the Temple of Set; thus it is the symbol carried by each of the Nine. The first two lines of hieroglyphics read: uset-f neter Set em xennu kekiu em-sa pa xepe em pet (\"The throne of the divine Set is within the Darkness behind the Star Thigh in the heavens.\"). This refers to the traditional as sociating of Set with the astronomical north pole (the Egyptians' \"Thigh of Se t\" constellation), the principle star of which then being Alpha Draconis and now being Polaris. Following the name of the individual Setian is: \"is Come Into Being (as),\" the appropriate degree, \"of the divine Temple of Set,\" and then the most recent Solstice or Equinox. All founding memberships in the Temple of Set are dated to the North Solstice X -- being the reconstruction of the Temple via the Book of Coming Forth by Night . On each II°+ stele next appears the following two lines: Sexem-fs em utu rit er- tep ta (\"he/she has gained the mastery of what was set forth to be done for me upon Earth.\"). Un-hefs em qeb hesi (\"Let him/her live in the Company of the Elect.\"). The final line: \"It is Come Into Being (by) the High Priest, the Divine Chief Scribe (Executive Director), and the Sacred Person of the Nine Great Gods (Chairman of the Council of Nine).\" The Stele of Xeper is to be framed against a background of the color of the individual recipient's degree. It should remain obscure to those not within the Temple of Set."},{"pageNumber":1367,"pageContent":" Stele of Xeper"},{"pageNumber":1368,"pageContent":"Footnotes 1. Ed. historical note: Shortly after the founding of the Temple of Set, membership certificates were issued to all Setians. These certificates were fashioned as Egyptian stele, designed specifically for this purpose. This article was written in the year X, and distributed to each initiate along with the stele. It was published along with the detailed notes in an earlier Ruby Tablet , and dropped from the Tablet when these stele were discontinued in favor of a mo re modern certificate in later years. References: This article's notes refer to several books found in the bibliography. 2. Ouarda (Crowley's wife Rose) claimed to be in contact with Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a god- figure from the so-called Stele of Reveali ng. She directed Crowley to the exhibit in the Boulak Museum where he discovered th e catalog number of the stele to be 666. Of this he wrote: \"...I dismissed it as an obvious coincidence.\" [ref. 11, page 394]. This did, however, have an effect on him, as he had long before adopted the \"number of the Beast\" 666 as a title. Earlier, Ouarda had instructed Crowley to compose an invocation to Horus, which, after much questioning and not a little argu ment, he did on March 19, 1904 CE. His first attempt to use the invocation failed . His second attempt, on March 20, was successful, and he was informed that: \"The Equinox of the Gods had come.\" [ref. 11, page 394]. From this followed the Book of the Law . All of the antiquities from the Boulak Mu seum are now in the National Museum at Cairo. The \"Stele of Revealin g\" may or may not still retain the catalog number 666. References: Crowley (11, 12, 14, 15, 16), Symonds (13). 3. Crowley though Ra-Hoor-khuit to be the ch ild of Nuit and Hadit [ref. 16, page 107]; Nuit being the ultimate of woman, and Hadit being the ultimate of man. [ref 17, page 247]. Further, he tied Ra-Hoor-Khuit to Ho or-Paar-Kraat [ref 16, page 143], a god- figure whom Budge describes as Horus th e Younger [ref 18]. As mentioned in the article, he also considered Hadit to be Hoor-Paar-Kraat or Heru-pa-kraath. That Crowley believed Ra-Hoor-Khuit to be a manifestation of Horus the Younger is further evidenced by his referring to him as the \"Crowned and Conquering Child\" [ref 11, page 399]. Of further interest concerning Ra-Hoor-Khuit is that during the period in early G\\Egyptian civilization when the priests of Ra held power, every effort was taken to make Osiris inferior to Ra in heaven. With the end of the VI Dynasty, the power of the priesthood of Ra diminished, and the Os iris cult began to prosper. All of the attributes of Ra were transferred to Osiris, and the name of Ra was joined to that of Osiris, much as it had been to the names of other gods in an earlier time such as Ra- Heru-khuti (Ra-Hoor-Khuit) and Ra-Tem. Thus, in the Book of the Dead we find Ra-Osiris [ref. page A-13, note IV-13]. In Magick [ref 16], on page 296, Crowley tied Hadit to the Hebrew Satan. (Kenneth"},{"pageNumber":1369,"pageContent":"Grant on page 209 of [19] has the audacity to call Hadit the Chaldean form of Set!) Hadit may be tied to HarWer (Horus the Elder) in that the Hadit-figure on the Stele of Revealing is really the figure of Behde ty, which Crowley himself referenced in volume 7 of the Equinox [12]. [ref page A-6, note II-5]. This connects Hadit indirectly to Set via HarWer. See the Book of Coming Forth by Night. To be more accurate, that Crowley calls Hadit Satan, couples Hadit to Set/HarWer (Satan), not Set in his pure form, as in the present Aeon. Further, Hadit was the father-god whom Crowley equated with Yod of the Hebrew Yod He Vau He ; Nuit being the mother- goddess and the first He . See Crowley [16] for more of this. Nuit, the mother-goddess, is Nut, the wife of Seb, goddess of the sky (hence, \"... the limitless extension of Nuit\"), and the mother of Osiris, Isis, Set, Anubis, Nepthys, Shu, and Tefnut; at least according to Osirian mythology. [See Budge 8.] References: Budge (8, 18), Crowley (1 1, 16, and 12 [Vol I, No. VII]). 4. Reference Te Velde 22, page 1 72, stele at Oriental Institute. The \"Eye of Ra\" is a reference to the S un. In the \"Seventy-five Praises of Ra\" inscribed on the walls of many XIX and XX Dynasty tombs is found the following: \"Praise be to thee, O Ra, exalted Sekhem; thou makest thy hand to pass and praisest thine Eye ...\" [ref Budge 18, volume 1, pa ge 342). Sekhem, the term from which the name of the goddess Sekhet is derived, means to be strong or mighty. Sekhet was often referred to as the \"Eye of Ra.\" 5. Chapter II (the Hadit chapter), verse 50, of the Book of the Law , states: \"Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in my eyes & my spangles are purple & green.\" Hadit, who is supposedly speaking here, is the day; hence, \"Blue am I ...\" Nuit, the sky, the Universe as a whole, and the Sun, is the \"bride.\" [ref. Book of the Law , Chapter II, Verse 21: \"Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The Sun, Strength & Sight, Light ...\") As for the \"red gleam\" and \"my spangles are purple & green,\" Crowley makes the following observations in the Equinox , Volume I, Number VII, page 396 (these observations also apply to Verse 51, quoted in the article): Purple - the ultra-violet (v. 51), the most positive of colours. Green - the most negative of colours, half-way in the spectrum. The Magical Image of Hadit is therefore an Eye within a coiled serpent, gl eaming red - the spiritual red of not mere = at the apex of the Triangle in the half circle of Nuit's Body [ed note: here ref Budge (8), page 292, illustration entitled \"The god Shu lifting up Nut from Seb.\"] and shedding spangles as of the spectrum of eight colours, including the ultra-violet but not the ultra-red... Green being the \"most negative\" of all colors and purple being the \"most positive,\" Verse 50 takes us back to the old idea of du ality (i.e.: good & evil, night & day, etc.). He who lacks the vision of the Magus V° (or even the Magister Templi IV°) perceives the Void of the Abyss as black and empty. The Magus V°, however,"},{"pageNumber":1370,"pageContent":"perceives it as deep violet, and he seem s much within its depths. Ref. rhodopsin. Cela Viendra . Eliphas Levi, in The Keys of the Mysteries [20], makes references to the thirty-two paths, being the then numbers and 22 letters of the Hebrew Kabalah. On page 157 is found the following: \"The thirty-first refers to , which represents the magic lamp, or the light between the horns of Baphomet.\" Ea rlier, on the same page is: \"The thirty- first path is called the perpetual inte lligence...\" A direct reference to the understanding of the Magus V° TS, and related to: \"... th e spiritual red of not mere ...\" above. being the symbol for fire. Continuing the point, in the Book of Thoth [21], on page 220, Crowley refers to (shin) as: \"Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The Aeon of the Twin Child! Exult, o Empyrean!\"; and on page 278 he compares it with the XXth trump card of the tarot called The Aeon (in the old pack it is called The Last Judgment). On page 115, Crowley offers the following explanation: \"...an adaptation of the Stele of Revealing,\" and \"The card therefore represented the destruction of the world by Fire. This was accomplished in the year of the vulgar era 1904, when the fiery god Horus took the place of the airy god Osiris ...\" [ref. The Stele of Xeper , paragraph 3, page 5.] If all of this makes little sense to you, fear not. Much of the Book of the Law eluded Crowley, by his own admission. 6. Heru-khuti (Horus of the Two Horizons ) is related to Ra-Harakhte, and to Heru- khuti-Ra and Heru-khuti-Khepera. In the Hy mns to Ra [Budge (18), volume 1, page 336] is found the following: \"Homage to thee, O Her-khuti, who are the god Khepera, the self-created; when thou risest on the horizon ...\" The reference to \"risest\" ties Heru-khuti to Khepera, and is clarified in note 7 below. [Ref. Crowley (12), No. 7.] Heru-Behutet (Behdety) was one of the most important forms of Horus the Elder, and the form of Heru-khuti at midday during his (i.e.: the sun's) greatest heat. See note 7 below, reference Khepera flying duri ng the heat of the day. [Ref. Crowle (12), No. 7: \"Behdet (?Hadit?)\" 7. Khepera (Xepera) was a form of the rising sun, the matter that was at the point of passing from one state into another, and th e third form of Ra, the sun-god. The name is based on the Xeper beetle - the dung beetle or scarab. The scarab beetle is in the family Scarabæidae , being the genus Scarabaeus, and the species sacer. The worship of it predates that of Ra, just as does the worship of Set and HarWer (i.e.: Horus the Elder). It was associated with the sun because it flies during the hottest part of the day, and beca use the dung ball which contains its eggs (thus containing potential life, as does the sun) is rolled before it much the same way as the sun, to the Egyptian mind, seemed to roll across the sky. The beetle, as well as the god Khepera, was believed to be self-bego tten, probably due to the fact that both the male and the female of the species appe ar very similar, and both tend the egg (or larvae) containing the dung ball. Being self-begotten, Khepera was sometimes"},{"pageNumber":1371,"pageContent":"referred to as the \"father of the gods.\" References: Budge (8, 18). 8. The Ankh, or Anx, was the Egyptian symbol for \"life.\" It was also worn as an amulet, generally as a pendant around the neck. It is a very early symbol, and most every god is pictured carrying one. The object that the symbol represents is unknown, though many theories (most of which are quite fanciful), from its being phallic in origin to it representing a sandal strap, have emerged. Witness the Egyptian word anxi (ankhi) at the right -- \"living.\" The Tcham-sceptre, or djam, is also called the uas-sceptre. It is a very early symbol, and like the Anx, most every god is pictured carrying one. It is symbolic of \"strength\" and \"power,\" though in Egyptian hieroglyphic writing it is combined with other signs to form totally unrelated words. For example, the word uasi [show n at the left] -- \"decay.\" There are some variation to the sceptre, one of them being as shown at the end of this paragraph, possessing a feather or wig. In this form it is the symbol of Hermontis, a nome of Upper Egypt. Most intriguing that many of the Egyptian gods and goddesses, including Isis, Ra, Sebek, and Seb, should be shown carrying the Tcham-sceptre, which incorporates the forked tail and head of the Set-animal!

The host controls 98% of the show -- his message will predominate. How much time will I have to speak? If there are two other guests in a half-hour slot, you'll have at most eight minutes. Decide what information you wish to present in that time. Hit your important points first, and summarize them if you get a chance.

Hopefully, this article will also aid in the development of confidence, as this can be a key factor in effective presentation. This article will cover the most important aspects of the art of public speaking in the following areas: 1. Planning 2. Presentation Style 3. The Introduction 4. The Body 5. The Conclusion Planning Planning is a key factor in all public speaking exercises. Good planning will insure that you are familiar with the material you will be working with, and more importantly, will psychologically assist you in confident and smooth presentation. While in the planning stage of a public speaking exercise, it is imperative that you take into consideration the following items: • The purpose of the exercise. • The target audience. • The environment in which you will be working. All of these three items are important. It is important that you consider what you are actually trying to achieve with any particular speaking engagement. Once you have decided on this, you can then structure your framework with this goal in mind. This will ensure that all your energies are Classification: V2 - D88 - 1 Author: Adam Campbell II° Date: December 30, XXV HTML Revision: N ov. 17, 1998 CE Subject:  Public  Speaking  Reading List:"},{"pageNumber":1376,"pageContent":"directed to the proper areas of concern. It will also assist you in your presentation, as you are less likely to wander off into irrelevant material and bore your audience. Also, importantly, the audience will have a sense that you \"know what you are talking about\" if you have a lucid comprehension of your purpose. Once you have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, you must then consider who will be your target audience. This is significant as a wrong delivery style can severely affect the impact of your exercise. When preparing for a public speaking exercise, research your audience as far as possible. You must consider their education, intelligence, cultural background, peer and professional associations, and whether the audience has any feelings of support or re jection for what you intend to communicate. When you have assessed your target audience, you must then consider how best to alter and adjust your working methodologies. For instance, if you were addressing an audience made up of the general public, a speech consisting of advanced terminology and highly technical terms would be totally inappropr iate. The above mentioned terms would be appropriate when addressing a profe ssional body or organi zation, however. It is important that you also give consideration to the environment in which you will be working. This is an important factor, as an improper working environment that has not been allowed for or modified can ruin an otherwise good presentation. You should look at the location with a critical eye from two perspectives: that of the speaker and that of the audience. The things to look for are situations that can disrupt or interfere with your presentation and delivery. It is very important that you know in advance whether you will need or can use a microphone, for example. Once you are familiar with the environmen t in which you will be working, and have adjusted or modified it as appropriate, you can then concentrate on the presentation and content of you public speaking exercise. Presentation Style Presentation style is an important factor in any public speaking exercise. Knowing what you are going to say is not enough. You mu st know how to effectively present and communicate what you intend to say as well. There are several key areas of presentation that should be addressed and considered by all who undertake a public speaking exercise. The main areas to take into consideration are; • Body Language. • Voice. • Visual Aids. Body language is perhaps the key factor in any presentation. Body language is a visual aid, but it is also so intricately and inti mately linked with human language and reaction"},{"pageNumber":1377,"pageContent":"mechanisms that it has a dimension all of its own. How you utilize body language can severely affect other areas relating to presentation -- for the better or the worse. Humans automatically home into each othe r's faces. This is instinctive. People subconsciously register subtle changes in facial features. It is important that you become aware of and learn to control your features. Make them dynamic and alive, while ensuring that they are in agreement with the mood you are imparting. Remember that change keeps people's interest. The most significant part of human facial features are the eyes. It is important that you make eye contact with the audience. This is wh y it is important not to rely on notes too heavily. When making eye contact with the audience it must be more than a fleeting glance. You must make sure that they know that you are talking to them. What you are looking for here is one to one eye contact, so that the individual realizes you are talking to him or her. When this occurs you can th en move onto another individual in another part of the audience. When shifting your attention, it is important not to just move across from one side of the audience to another, looking at each audience member in order. This looks unnatural, and the audience may get the feeling that they are being processed. You should look to different areas of the audience, so that you get a good general coverage (though still making individual contacts in each area). The actual areas you should look to so you can make contact is dependent on natural body movement. This is so that head movement is as natural looking as is possible. You should not be leaning over the podium so that you can talk to someone. While the face and eyes are significant fact ors in human body language, the rest of the body should not be ignored. Gesturing is an almost instinctive activity when speaking, and should be used when giving a presentation. All gesturing should be used to further enhance, define, and emphasize what you are saying. This can include walking towards a visual aid or even towards the audience. This should be done purposely if and when it is appropriate, so that it commands the audience's full attention. Returning to the podium allows the audience to relax, and can be used to signal that you are moving to a new topic or area. It is important not to pace back and forth, nor to wander about aimlessly. Also, ensure that you do not rock back and forth or sway about. A good way to avoid this when you are standing is to spread your legs slightly apart. All of the above should be as smooth and natural looking as possible. If you use gesturing correctly, you will be able to command and direct attention at will. The human voice is one of the most important communication mediums. Not only does it convey thoughts and concepts, it also convey s emotions, attitudes and feelings. Most people do this instinctively. If you are going to do a presentation, however, you should raise your use of this instrument to much higher levels. The use of the voice in an effective manner is thus an essential pa rt of any public speaking exercise."},{"pageNumber":1378,"pageContent":"It is important that you can be clearly hear d when you do a public speaking exercise. You should speak at normal conversation level, an d should never shout. If the audience cannot hear you at this level, you should be using some form of public address system. The most important point to remember about the volume of your voice is that it should have some variety in its level. Variety make s your speech much more interesting. The volume of your voice should increase when you wish to emphasize a point, and decrease when you are making a personal comment or an elaboration. The use of such emphasis adds another dimension to public speaking. Th e correct use of this aspect can load a particular sentence with much more meaning than would otherwise be understood. It is important that you speak at a normal rate. This will vary from culture to culture. Choose a pace that is normal and comfortable for you, unless you tend to be a very fast or slow speaker. Remember that nervousness can make some people rush extremely fast through what they have to say. If this is likely to be a problem for you, you should write \"SLOW\" at the beginning of your outline no tes or point cards as a reminder. Either extreme in your rate of speech will interfer e with the message you are trying to impart. Slow speakers seem ponderous and boring, while fast speakers do not allow the audience to follow the development of ideas. The pause in speech is a factor that is often overlooked. It is a very useful device, and can have a very powerful effect when properly used. It can be used to draw the audience's back to you, alert them that you are changing the subject or going onto the next item, or create an expectation that something important is to come. Most speakers tend to habitually \"um\" and \"ah\" between sentences and paragraphs, while they think about what they are going to say next. Such noises interfere with clear communication, and should be avoided. It is mu ch better to be silent and not distract your audience. A good way to avoid this problem is to breathe inwards while you pause. It is physically impossible to do both at the same time! It is important that your diction be at a very high standard when you do a presentation. Good diction is necessary for clear communication, and more importantly, it imparts an impression of professionalism. Individual word s should be brought together fluently, that is grouped together within a natural soundi ng sentence structure. This will keep the audience's attention on the message of your presentation. Visual aids can also be of use in your presen tation. The main point to take into account before you use them, however, is to understand that they are aids , that is, adjunct to the main body of your presentation. Things such as an overhead projector and the like are very effective, when used properly. They are used best when they are used in situations where it can be hard to communicate large amounts of information clearly. Things like graphs and diagrams are very useful he re, but should be used sparingly. Handouts can also be used, but only for reference after you have completed your presentation. Referring the audience to a hand out while in the middle of a presentation"},{"pageNumber":1379,"pageContent":"can be very distracting and disruptive for you and the audience. Handouts are for use by the audience after your presentation is over. When doing a public speaking exercise, it is imperative that you present the content of your presentation in a proper framework. This means having a three-layer approach: an introduction, a main body, and a conclusion. Introduction The introduction is a very significant part of your presentation. You have a very short time in which to get the attention of the audience -- perhaps one minute at most. People decide very quickly whether you are really worth paying attention to. It is very important that you and your relevant credentials are k nown and established with the audience. This can be done either by yourself or by someone else properly introducing you. The audience needs not only to know what you will be talking about, but also why you are qualified to talk about it. In the introduction you outline and introduce the topic of your exercise. This must be clear and as interesting as possible. What you are doing here is setting the scene, giving the audience (and yourself) an idea of what is to come. A good introduction is essential for you psychol ogically. This is one area that you should prepare thoroughly before the exercise. If th e introduction is smooth and clear, you will find the remainder much easier. The Body The main body of your presentation will take the vast majority of your speaking time. This is where the main theme is developed, expanded, and supported by other ideas and supporting evidence. It is important to develop you ideas in a logi cal way. In large or complicated exercises, break the main theme into smaller, more manageable sections. This should be done to make the job at hand easier for both you and the audience. Be sure that these individual sections are built up in support of each other. These individual sections should have a structure similar to that used for the overa ll content of your presentation (i.e. an introduction, body, and summary). When presenting the main body of your exercise, it is important to keep an eye on the time-span you have and are usin g. People get restless after th irty or so minutes, and you should you should plan to have a natural break in your presentation around this time if it is an extended presentation. Ti me keeping is critical if you are one of several presenters."},{"pageNumber":1380,"pageContent":"The Conclusion The conclusion is also a very significant part of any public speaking exercise. The final segment of your presentation is the part that is almost always remembered best by an audience. You should insure that it is as interesting or provoking as possible to exploit this fact to your advantage. The conclusion should thus be much more th an just a summary of topics covered and conclusions reached or presented. The conclusi on should be used to drive home the core themes of your presentation. Colourful, expressive language is called for here. If the subject matter is suitable, this area can be used very effectively as a \"call to arms\" or challenge for action. The underlying principle of operation here is to evoke some form of emotional reaction from the audience. This will make the conclusion -- and the themes you include in it -- memorable.
