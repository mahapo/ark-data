[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"On Set by Tapio Kotkavuori Priest of Set This article was originally published in The Scroll of Set Jan-Feb, 1998 CE. For me, Set is the Principle of Isolate Intelligence, who gave mankind the Gift of selfconsciousness in pre-historic times in order to strengthen his own Being, and in order to give mankind the possibility to self-conscious, invidividual existence. Self-consciousness is a feature that separates human beings from natural universe. Because of this feature we are able to take into consideration in our actions past, present and future, to make notions about good and evil, give meaning and purpose to things, to effect the universe according to our own will, and to experience existence as selfconscious individuals. Whereas natural universe is predictable, human beings have possibility to act unpredictably, to be free Beings. Set is the metamodel for such individual existence. My relationship to Set is that of mutual respect in enhancing and exalting his Gift of selfconsciousness. I do not pray nor ́worship ́ Set. Set does not tell me what is ́good ́ and ́evil ́; it is my own responsibility to reason ethical (and other) questions and act according to that reasoning. I take full responsibility for my actions. When I communicate with Set, I do not lose my individuality, but become strenghtened by him in my self-consciousness and Initiatory (Self developing) Work. As a Priest of Set I seek to enhance the possibility for individual, self-conscious, autonomous potential of mankind to actualize within the Temple of Set, and without it as well as appropriate - this does not include any kind of converting; by its very nature the need for individual selfbetterment must come from within an individual himself. No one can do such a work for others, only for oneself. Reality of Set is not based on mere knowledge or on mere intuition. It is based on both, but it is essentially via rationally based intuition, my own conscious efforts to understand my own Self, via my own conscious efforts to Come Into Being as a more perfect, more autonomous individual, that I have Experienced the Principle, that it has become Necessary for my own Initiation (Self development process) and Self- understanding. Set will not be known to those who try to approach him with blind faith or with strict scientific method. Possibility to come to know Set will raise only through exercise of one's own Will, rationally based honest inquiry on one's Self and on Set as the metamodel for self-conscious, autonomous, individual Being. One of our senior Initiates wrote a good summary about the nature of Set:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I. Set is the Principle of Isolate Intelligence. II. It is dynamic (evolving). III. Its purpose is self- maintenance, expansion, and perpetuation. This is its only good - otherwise it is beyond good and evil. IV. It is not omnipotent - it must work for the changes it causes. V. It is not omniscient - it must work to see objectively. VI. Its Gift of Self is perfect (complete). VII. It can inform or \"teach\" those possessed of its quality. VIII.To give more (if possible) would be to take. IX. The presense of the Gift in us (flesh) is necessary to the evolution of the Principle of Isolate Intelligence. Great is the Might of Set, Greater still he through us. Xeper."}]
