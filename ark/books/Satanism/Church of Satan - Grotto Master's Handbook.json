Grotto participation isn't required for active members, but many Satanists find it invigorating and inspiring to be in contact with others. We use the word \"grotto\" as a general term for an associated subgroup of the Church of Satan, consisting of members of the Church of Satan and adhering to our philosophy. \"Grotto\"- which actually comes from the Latin word for \"crypt\" or \"vault\"-has the appropriate connotation of diabolical, hidden rites taking place in dank, ancient sepulchers consecrated in the Names of the Evil Ones. In forming your group, you don't have to use the term \"grotto\" per se if you feel more comfortable with Order, Corps, Troupe, Troop, Society, Coalition, Tribe, Pack, Temple, Garrison, League, Lodge, Cabal. Consult your thesaurus for other imaginative possibilities. More important than the name is your clear understanding of Satanism, your unswerving dedication to the Church of Satan, and your commitment to promote and apply Satanic values in the world. It only takes you to make a grotto - you, your family, a friend - and you may choose to keep it that way. That will depend on where you want to apply your ambition. This is an organization for non-joiners, and many of our finest people choose not to be involved in group activities of any kind. They want to concentrate their full energy toward their own advancement and then contribute to the Church of Satan through that power. You'll never know where all our grottos are located or who among the thousands of people you encounter in your life may be Satanists. But you'll benefit from their help when you need it if they know you're a Satanist. You'll encounter a wide range of people in your role as Grotto Master. Be warned: Many you attract won't understand the first thing about Satanism. Since The Satanic Bible advocates selfishness and indulgence, there will be those who think that means they can do whatever they want and call it Satanism, no matter how anti-Satanic their actions may be. There will be those who just want to use Satanism as a cheap identity. You may run across kids who just want sex, drugs and rock and roll; some may want to sacrifice cats and babies; others may want orgies or to see redheaded nude altars; some \"sincere inquirers\" may want to attend a Satanic ritual \"just to see what it's like\" (this request is usually accompanied by a giggle); they may be Christians or misguided law enforcement associates who want to \"infiltrate\" to expose our evil network once and for all. You can deal with all of these types confidently with the instructions in this book. Most of this information, however, will concentrate on true Satanists who want to feel connected to the full force of the Church of Satan through you. Satanism has all the elements to qualify it to become the major religion of the 21st century. You are a part of creating that future. Many who are devoted Satanists may have nothing in common except their Satanism. But if that is deeply-felt, it will be enough to bind us strongly together. That is one thing that makes us unusual. The finest of our Advocates exemplify a sense of discipline, determination, and destiny that sets them apart from the crowd and 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"marks them as one of Satan's Own. This handbook will instruct you on how you can serve as a Grotto Master in a way that will honor Satan and His church. Section One General Administration 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We try to keep \"administrivia\" to a bare minimum but any large organization requires at least a modicum of structure and paperwork, so that we present a cohesive and coordinated front. It's easier for you to meet requirements and standards if they are clearly mapped out for you. For some people, structure, no matter how minimal and benign, is an invitation for rebellion; for others, it's a tool for their own self-discipline and productivity. Your progress will reflect what your personal predispositions are. You are obviously expected to be intimate with all of Dr. LaVey's writings and principles in order to clearly represent Satanism so they won't be covered here. It's presumed that your activities and representation will reflect that familiarity and be in keeping with the tenets of the Church of Satan. The Nine Satanic Statements, Eleven Rules of the Earth, Satanic Sins and Pentagonal Revisionism – the cornerstones of Satanic philosophy - are reprinted in the back of this handbook for ready reference. There are also several forms which can be photocopied and submitted as necessary (don't write on the originals). We require you to send in monthly status reports, to keep us informed of your activity level, public or media representation, and any problems you may have with your members or in your community. Your monthly report may be very simple - noting that you took your family to the park or gave an informational lecture at the local occult bookstore or conducted a Halloween ritual with friends. As your grotto grows, your reports will become more elaborate - you may include meeting minutes, flyers you've printed up, texts of significant rituals you've devised, media contact reports.... We also require yearly evaluations of your performance as Grotto Master, by other Church of Satan members and/or others who have benefited from your expertise. Again, these are \"field reports\", so we get an idea of how capably you're performing your duties. You can scan the other forms in Appendix E, which will be necessary as occasions arise. Your first duty, as a Satanist, is to yourself. Then to those you care about-your partner, your children, those in your family you choose to give your love to. Your third, self- appointed duty, is to the Church of Satan and your fellow members. You have chosen to shoulder these extra responsibilities because you feel an intensity of Satanic focus in your life, beyond what the average lay member may feel. Within this organization you'll find your leaders, your followers and your friends. We don't expect you to proselytize, but we do expect you to inform and clear up misinformation. We encourage Grotto Masters to have wives, husbands, mates or a similar stable relationship with someone who is also a Satanist, or is supportive of your increased involvement. A Grotto Master with a partner is more stable, loyal, consistent by nature and is not using the organization to \"get girls\", or boys, as the case may be. Someone in a mated situation has more to lose, and so is more cautious and forward- thinking when necessary. If you don't have a partner, you'll probably develop a second in command, a right-hand man (or woman) you can depend on to be consistent, loyal, trustworthy and strongly dedicated to Satanic principles and the Church of Satan in the same way you are. Your yearly grotto fees will be assessed on the basis of how many members you have in your grotto, on a sliding scale as described below: 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" $100/yr. for 1-20 members $200/yr. for 21-40 members $400/yr. for 41-60 members $600/yr. for 61-80 members $800/yr. for 81-100 members As a public representative, you'll reach many potential members and you'll receive $10 credit toward your yearly grotto fees for every direct Sponsorship of a new Church of Satan member (as noted in your monthly report and confirmed by the applicant's notation of you as his or her Sponsor on the initial membership registration form). It would be unSatanic for us to expect you to run your grotto at a financial loss to yourself. You'll no doubt charge a minimal annual participation charge for your consistent members, to cover your grotto fees and operating expenses. We would expect you to be paid for your time in the case of open introductory lectures (perhaps $4-5 at the door), speaking engagements and any magical consultations you may do. But we don't expect to you to take advantage of your position of trust. You should consider a certain amount of free representation to be part of your public relations responsibilities - media interviews, talks at public school or university classes you may be invited to, law enforcement lectures or consultations, community groups you may be asked to address. There is a balance. We will have spotters evaluate your situation from time to time, to let us know that your monthly membership figures are accurate. Grotto authority for over 100 members will require further negotiation. For any events you advertise as affiliated with the Church of Satan, we'd require you to receive written clearance for the event beforehand and arrange to donate a percentage of your receipts. If you have a proposal for a significant project (one that might attract more than 1000 people), submit the proposal in writing and see if we can make suggestions and grant approval to do it under the auspices of the Church of Satan. We'll then make formal financial arrangements and decide if you can use official Church of Satan endorsement in your advertising. Also, don't commit the Church of Satan to any financial debt. We cannot assume financial responsibility for anything that you contract for. These are the most basic monetary concerns; we don't want to overadministrate the financial end of things unless or until it becomes necessary. Never use the trademarked Baphomet on your own business cards, promotional flyers, newsletters, or stationary. We encourage Grotto Masters to devise a symbol that is uniquely their own. Do not use the Baphomet to advertise products or events without written permission from the Church of Satan, and your agreement to pay token royalty fees. These are usually minimal but are a sign of recognition of C/S authority and respect for our High Priest. Qualified new Church of Satan members in your area will be given your post office box number. It will be up to them to initiate contact at their discretion. If you print up business cards with your grotto name and address, send us 20-40 of them so that We can simply slip the card into inquirers' envelopes. You need to develop a \"calendar of events\" 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of whatever design suits you so you can mail it to new C/S members and general inquirers when they ask when you're conducting your next public information meeting or Introductory Satanism seminar. Out of courtesy, send a copy of your events schedule to any C/S officials you know of in your area, to keep them informed of local activities. It is certainly possible for you to be a covert Grotto Master - one who, because of professional or personal responsibilities, may not want to coordinate public events. That's fine, if you can show why your situation Warrants secrecy. But you'll still be expected to be available as a contact point for local members. Just make sure Central Grotto (and any Church of Satan officials you have contact with) understand that you want to remain covert for now. Also, understand that we cannot guarantee your anonymity. We don't have any dictates regarding when your grotto has to meet, or how often. It can be once a month, once a week, or whenever you, as Grotto Master, summon a gathering. Depending on your own interests and that of the dominant members in your grotto, you may want to emphasize intellectual pursuits, community activities, scientific experimentation, field trips and expeditions, practical self-improvement goals, or ceremonial magic. Grottos often find it energizing and productive to center on a compelling theme. If many of you are interested in cyberculture or future-oriented realities, you may want to be called Bladerunner Grotto or Grotto 2001, for instance. If you're interested in astronomy or the sea or Greek mythology, you could be the Polaris Grotto or Poseidon Grotto or Hephaestus Grotto. If your emphasis is on total environments, perhaps Westworld Grotto would be appropriate. If Gothic, Ravencrest or Blackthorne Grotto. You may want to write up your own material, explaining the name of your grotto, what your main focus is, what your intentions are, passing along any strengthening or inspirational guidelines for your members. This is fine just as long as it is in keeping with Satanic policy, General Administration further reinforcing and codifying Dr. LaVey’s work. Send copies of any such material to Central Grotto of the Church of Satan to keep in your Grotto Master file. Try to be imaginative and descriptive in choosing an orienting image. If you're the only one in the group so far, so much the better-it makes your choice less subject to debate. Eventually, if your group's concentration of interest and consistent level of activity warrants it, we may begin referring participants to you on the basis of topic or area of expertise, rather than just locale. As a point of internal magical interaction, others in your grotto may call you \"Master (last name)\" or simply \"Master\". This is a term of respect, unless you give them permission to call you by your first name. \"Master\" is used to refer to both men and women Grotto Masters, unless a woman prefers the title \"Mistress\". Likewise, you refer to others in your group as \"Mr. (last name),\" \"Mrs.\" or \"Miss so-and-so\", unless given permission to do otherwise. If a member has chosen a magical name he'd prefer to use, respect his wishes by using that exclusively, keeping his birth name to yourself. Don't be overly obsessive about titles and the hierarchical workings of the Church of Satan; information within the C/S is on a Need-to-Know basis. Our High Priest is our autocrat, advised by the Council of Nine and the Order of the Trapezoid. Beyond that, 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"you'll be assigned information as you progress and as need arises. We don't appreciate our Grotto Masters \"bucking\" for promotion. Our ruling bodies, such as the Council of Nine and the Order of the Trapezoid, are appointed positions, as is the Priesthood. Those who would claim such appointments the loudest no doubt haven't been granted such positions. If you want to know, \"How do I become a Priest?\", the answer is, \"Through hard work, material achievement and Satanic influence in the outside world.\" When you're appointed as an Agent or Priest/ess, it means you've caught the attention of the High Priest through your consistent dedication and strength, and that you've earned his respect. You can endeavor toward appointment as a Priest through the work you do as a Grotto Master. That isn't the only way someone becomes a Priest, but it's a good way. You can represent yourself to the public as an approved Church of Satan Grotto Master, but not as an Agent or Priest (unless you are one). You have the authority to represent Satanism, but not necessarily the Church of Satan. Your performance as a Grotto Master will be periodically reviewed with an eye toward appointing you as an Agent or Priest. It is through this position that you can prove yourself worthy of the Priesthood. Let the structure for your own grotto reflect that of the Church of Satan as a whole: Don't over-administrate! You don't need complex rules, regulations, degrees and tests for advancement! It betrays you as more interested in the trappings and illusion of power and authority than actually earning respect and getting something accomplished. As your grotto grows, you may want to assign someone as Secretary to take minutes of meetings, to handle whatever necessary correspondence comes up and to prepare and submit the monthly grotto reports to Central Grotto. You might want to assign someone the role of Financial Officer to collect funds when necessary, to keep an uncomplicated ledger in order to keep track of what your group has to work with and help plan activities accordingly. You might want to assign someone who can gather information, make phone calls and various arrangements. But these appointments are based on practical need, not artificial degrees. Satanism is not dependent on a closed system (degrees, jargon, etc.) to make us feel alienated and therefore, elite. We aren't self-referential. There is no need to create an artifice of power when an organization has a real, demonstrable power in the world. Those who can recognize real power will judge the Church of Satan by your performance as Grotto Master. Keeping that in mind, there are certain things that a Church of Satan grotto should never be. These have been outlined in the Satanic Bunco Sheet which you've no doubt read. We've included those tips in the back of this handbook as a reminder of how not to conduct your group. Please review them once again. In light of the many Satanic pretenders the Bunco Sheet describes, please keep your Grotto Master certificate in a safe place-you may be called upon to produce it to prove to a potential member that you do indeed speak with the authority of a qualified Church of Satan Grotto Master. Grotto Master status can be revoked at any time for: -Non-payment of annual grotto fees. -No monthly reports. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"-No yearly Grotto Master -Evaluation forms completed and returned by participants. -Inadequate or inaccurate representation of Satanism and/or the Church of Satan. -Illegal activities. -Conducting your grotto in a way antithetical to the policies of the Church of Satan. -Conducting yourself and/or your grotto in a way that would bring dishonor to the Church of Satan. We recommend that Grotto Masters initiate two distinct levels of activities-one for the general public (Satanic information lectures, LaVey study groups, etc.) and one for committed Church of Satan members. We require that Church of Satan members who request deeper involvement in a grotto be screened directly by the Grotto Master, since they would be participating in rituals and social activities in which exposure to addresses and other personal details about you and other members would be unavoidable. Rituals will, of course, have to be held in someone's home or on someone's private land - that's why you must screen properly. If, for whatever reason, you want a ritual to include uninitiated members, do it outdoors, with torches blazing. But be aware that photographs are likely, and that license numbers and descriptions of your cars will probably be noted by the curious. You need to protect yourself and our members (more about this in the last chapter). Second-level participation screening consists of having the applicant produce his Church of Satan membership card (which you will photocopy for us), filling out a short form included in Appendix E, then meeting with him or her at a neutral location (such as a restaurant, coffee house, or public park), accompanied by one or two assistants. You will evaluate his qualifications for further involvement, make a decision and send us the results. This is part of your vital, practical training as a Grotto Master: you must not be naive. You will learn to judge character accurately and ruthlessly. We require that second-level participants (designated as \"grotto participants\"), always be members of the Church of Satan. This isn't just to insure money for the Church of Satan (though that's certainly necessary to keep it going); it's a test of their dedication, showing they want to put themselves out enough to join. They aren't so secretly terrified of the \"S\" word that they won't commit themselves to Satanic principles, but only want to be entertained by you, perhaps harboring visions of infiltration and lurid exposure. The one- time Church of Satan membership fee is a token that they are willing to commit themselves materially and spiritually to the Prince of Darkness. Be distrustful of anyone who balks at having to pay that one-time fee to become part of the Church of Satan. They will prove themselves to be contentious fence-straddlers who you won't be able to do enough for, who will demand answers and justification for everything, who will try to stir your members against you then leave in a huff to create trouble elsewhere. Just because we have open forums, we cannot allow ourselves to be over-run by weaklings who only long for friends and stimulation, or by fence-straddlers who want to take advantage of our social and professional network without committing themselves - or worse, to criticize and factionalize us. (See Appendix A) Be ever on guard. Though you don't have the authority to expel someone from the Church of Satan, you always have the authority to expel someone from your grotto. Note in your monthly report if 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"someone is expelled from your grotto and why; it's necessary for us to know if someone is a troublemaker. Weed them out; make it clear you see their motives even if they don't. There may come a time in the very near future when we will all have to know who to trust and who we can't trust. The opportunity for exploitation of a more firmly-structured grotto network is one reason why Dr. Lavey has kept grottos underground for a time; he doesn't want to see what he's worked hard to build exploited and diluted. Each Grotto Master is a guardian. The grotto system can seep back underground once more if it proves to be counterproductive. Since you are in a position to publicly represent Satanism, you will come under more punishing scrutiny than a lay member would. We cannot have our Grotto Masters in any position that would compromise the Church of Satan legally. If you get slapped on the wrist once in awhile by Central Grotto, take it in the spirit of professional necessity that its given. You have taken increased responsibility on your shoulders and are bound to stumble from time to time in your advancement. Don't be discouraged or think you will be forever condemned for minor setbacks. Central Grotto is understanding of well- intentioned mistakes. A magical mentor could tell you many secrets about human foibles, and you would trust his advice on an intellectual level - but you'd only be firmly convinced by bitter, hard-won, first-hand experience. Everything is a test. We don't play games; these are very real tests with very practical results. Even silence can be a test. You or the members under you may be called upon to provide certain things to the Church of Satan or to perform certain tasks as necessary. This will never be anything illegal or beyond your capabilities. We don't ask you to pass written examinations. We ask you to produce and progress. The Dark Ones will challenge you even more severely. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Section Two Public Relations and Media Procedures 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"One of the initial questions Grotto Masters often ask is, \"I don't have any members - how do I get started?\" First of all, keep in mind that the Church of Satan values quality of adherents over quantity. You don't need a lot of people to make up a grotto. You will maintain your grotto status if your grotto only consists of you, your family and a few close friends. We aren't evangelical by nature. We don't need professional Satanic evangelists who think they can make a living proselytizing Satanism. We need people who understand Satanism and use it to improve their lives, and can communicate their enthusiasm to others when asked. That's all. It shouldn't be your sole identity, and it shouldn't take priority over the real world. That said, there are ways to make sure you are reaching others who may be interested in learning more about Satanism in your area. Post flyers and tasteful, understated advertisements in free papers for a LaVeyan study group. Advertise an Introductory Satanism meeting and locate a space to hold such a meeting. Contact local public libraries, a community center, local colleges or universities, occult stores or bookstores and ask that, if they have any programs of speakers, you would like to volunteer to give a talk on Satanism. Most of these outlets will probably be resistant, but if your approach is level-headed and responsible, you might be surprised to find some enthusiastic interest. (If you meet with hostility, of course, take all appropriate Satanic action.) Let word of mouth work for you. Tell your friends that you've recently been granted Grotto Master status and will be starting some activities – that they should tell anyone they think might be interested or worthy of involvement. You probably won't get many serious people, if any, the first few times you hold introductory talks. Keep at it. Eventually, news of your legitimate meetings will get to the right ears, you'll gain a reputation as the local Church of Satan representative and people will start contacting you. New Church of Satan members will begin sending for your schedule through the mail. You'll start to spot those with whom you feel aligned and will approach them on more advanced activities. It's a process - don't expect it to happen overnight. There are simple public relations tasks you and your group can take care of on a local level. Call up or visit local libraries and bookstores to make sure The Satanic Bible, The Satanic Rituals and other Satanic books are available. Photocopy the Church of Satan general information flyers to leave them available on a table at Introductory Satanism meetings. When or if you have your own business cards printed, have some business cards produced for the Church of Satan and slip them to appropriate people, put them in interesting places, insert them in books in libraries or bookstores where the right people will find them. When conducting public information meetings or acting as a Satanic consultant for local media or others, keep in mind the following caution that will be repeated throughout this handbook. If you request a position as a Grotto Master, you're appointing yourself as leader of an essentially open local forum, but don't give people you don't know and trust your home address or phone number. The person you give it to might be fine - but he'll 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"tell someone else, or leave it laying around where someone else can pick it up. It happens to some of our oldest, most cautious members. You simply can't be too careful. If you don't yet, have an answering machine and screen all your calls, get one now. The address or phone number of a real live Satanist is just too tantalizing. It's not so much that you'll put yourself in any serious danger - it's just that people will call you at all hours of the night and day to try to save your soul, offer you advice or feed off you by demanding you give them a detailed description of what Satanism is so they don't have to read the books. If you and your group decide that production and publication of a newsletter is a public relations project you want to undertake (and it seems a lot of Satanists do), go to it. Following in the footsteps of The Black Flame, you should always place a notice to the effect that: \"Any and all articles, letters, essays or commentary submitted to this publication yet demonstrating an ignorance of the principles and ideas in The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey will be ignored.\" There should also be a notice that the ideas expressed by the individual authors are theirs and don't necessarily reflect the policies of your magazine or those of the Church of Satan. Always remember to include an ad for the Church of Satan in your newsletter. Buy a copy of Elements of Style, a good grammar book, dictionary, thesaurus, and punctuation guide (or install them on your computer). Maintain exacting standards and produce a newsletter or journal that we can all be proud of. There is no excuse for a Satanist to produce a badly-photocopied, pasted together \"'zine\", with no regard for accurate spelling, grammar or punctuation, especially in our computer age. It reflects badly on all of us. If you do dare to produce such shoddy, worthless dross in the name of Satan, any self-respecting Satanist should have the right to tell you exactly what's wrong with it in great detail, if he wants to take the time and energy, and you have no right to feel hurt by his criticism. Be thankful that he or she is taking the time to improve your work and that he expects you can do better. Since the question will probably come up in the course of conversations, you should know our policy regarding other religions. We are not ecumenical in nature. It is against our policy to \"join forces\" with any other groups. We don't align ourselves with any existing political parties, extremist groups, any Wicca or pagan groups or councils, any politically subversive groups, or any ecumenical gatherings. That is the High Priest's directive and has been his steadfast policy since the Church's beginnings. We stand or fall on our own merits. We don't want other groups to latch onto our coattails for a free ride. They will, anyway, for their own survival - they need no sanction or encouragement from us. In our rituals, we are free to draw from a rich background of symbols, icons, music, and images-many of which have represented extreme evil and villainy. Many of these would no doubt be offensive to those who are politically or religiously sensitive. Though we borrow from many metaphors others would find abhorrent, we don't endorse or align ourselves with any other groups. We stand alone. As a public representative of Satanism you must understand this as a firm point of our policy. Your attitude should not be, \"Why can't we all get together as one happy family?\", but rather \"They seem all right but why don't they have the balls to call themselves Satanists and join the Church of Satan?\" As we progress as a force in the world, this may seem harsh to you since all other factions will have to come to us with their begging bowls. But they will have to kneel before Satan when they do; they will have to convert for their own best interests, just as people 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"have had to start singing \"Hallelujah\" to survive when the Inquisitors came. Don't let them sneak in under the tent flap. If ever there comes a time, for pragmatic reasons, to modify this policy, it would be at the High Priest's discretion. This is an organizational policy regarding Church of Satan alliances; we wouldn't presume to dictate who your friends are. You may find certain relationships with Christians, Pagans, etc., not only tolerable but useful. There may be certain political groups, social advocacy groups, or animal activist groups you want to lend your support to that may also have affiliations with members of other religions. We would only ask that you not blur the line between personal friendships and organizational endorsements. Our attitude toward mystical religions in general is one of disdainful tolerance as long as they stay out of our way. Some Satanists feel very antagonistic toward Christianity since it is the dominant religious force and counter to everything the Satanist believes in. These Satanists feel they must fight with their every sinew to eradicate Christianity - stamp out the stupidity, irrationality, hypocrisy and blindness that it encourages; that our very survival as a species depends on it. Other Satanists take a more pragmatic view, figuring the herd must be controlled and that mystical fears are the most practical way to keep them in line. They feel that Satanists are a breed apart and must use \"common man's\" fears, encourage them, feed them and utilize them. Whatever works to comfort Christians and keep them compliant is to our ultimate benefit. These Satanists hold other religions in contempt and use the weaknesses they foster for their own gain, without working to eradicate the source of others' fears. Both of these postures are Satanically pure. All of us share both of these attitudes. Both will be necessary for us to fulfill our destiny as an organization. In case you've gotten this far in your Satanic development and haven't figured this out yet: Satanists are not racist, apart from a distinct favoritism toward our own unidentified race: \"Satanist\". That delineation crosses racial boundaries as they are presently defined. A Satanist is ecumenical in his disdain for humanity. We hate everybody equally, and give each individual the responsibility to prove us wrong, on his or her own merits. We don't endorse any policy which dictates a blanket approval or disapproval, based solely on what we presently understand as ethnic background. Addressing more practical concerns, there are two common public relations scenarios you are likely to encounter in your role as Grotto Master. What follows are pointers for such situations so you'll be prepared and poised when the time comes. These aren't meant as dictates; you can make your own modifications as you gain confidence and experience. These are just general reminders and guidelines for your first few times. The first rule of dealing with the media is: Never trust a journalist. This may seem harsh and sweeping, to be suspicious of all journalists, but that's the general stance of a Satanist 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"about most people - then we're pleasantly surprised if someone exceeds our expectations. Journalists want a story, and are subject to the same kinds of foibles and fears that everyone else is. They can say whatever they want, promise whatever they want, just to get their story and just to get you to jump through hoops for them. They may seem very nice but members of the Church have been burned too many times by those who seem very aligned. Until they prove themselves trustworthy by writing or producing an objective, informative piece, assume their story will be biased against you and treat them accordingly. (See The Devil's Notebook article, \"Let Me Entertain You\", for Dr. LaVey's tips on how to turn the tables on journalists who think they're taking advantage of you.) When called upon to do an interview for a local newspaper, magazine, or television station, speak to the reporter or representative first over the phone. Ask what research he's done on the subject. Make sure he's already read The Satanic Bible and Rituals, at the very least. If he hasn't, emphasize he should buy copies before your meeting; they will answer a lot of elementary questions so you don't have to. Also, ask to see other pieces they've done, especially if they've written or produced something on Satanism before, or on a similarly controversial topic. For an interview destined for a print medium (newspaper, book or magazine), arrange to meet in a public place - never in your home. You don't know this person. Don't invite strangers into your lair. Bring some one with you - it makes a better impression, you won't feel as vulnerable and it will put the reporter on guard as well. To insure you're quoted accurately, bring a tape recorder and let the reporter know you're taping the questions and answers. Dress in suits and ties, women should dress either conservatively or flamboyantly, depending on how you feel your needs would best be served. Whether you're photographed or not depends on how high-profile you want to be. If you agree to photos, be aware of appropriate backgrounds and lighting; request prints for your own use. Request that you be allowed to read what they've written before it goes to press in order to check it for accuracy. If you're asked to do an on-screen interview, or a radio show, you probably won't meet with the host or producer (or whoever contacted you initially) until you go into the studio. That's why it's even more vitally important you ask the right questions before you walk into the studio. Don't agree to do a \"confrontational format\" debate-one in which the sides are loaded against you. If they want a rumble, you should be able to have at least one other Satanist on the panel with you, or another local \"expert\" who speaks reasonably (if there are any in your area). Otherwise, refuse to do the interview. Another thing to be wary of is allowing newspeople to attend and tape a ritual. \"This is a visual medium,\" they will explain. \"It would really be better if we could show rather than tell.\" Our policy generally discourages this kind of performance on demand for three reasons: 1) Unless they are committed Satanists, they won't enter the ritual chamber with the proper posture of respect it deserves. This is an insult to the aethers you've already established in that area. 2) You'll be disclosing more of your private life than you might want to. 3) It's all too easy for a ritual to look cheesy and amateurish if that's the journalists' agenda. It's up to them how they edit it. If they want your chamber to look overlit and cheap, it will. This is not to say that our people have never performed a ritual on camera; some have (including our High Priest) and it's turned out great. Some have 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"and it's embarrassing to watch. Our policy is not to perform rituals for cameras because we've seen it fail more often than succeed. If you feel it would benefit you and your Church, if you have worked with this person before and trust you'd get a fair shake, if you can take full control of camera angles, participants, costumes and lighting, use your own judgment. Keep the lights low and evoke confidently. If, after speaking to the television or radio representative over the phone, you are assured this person is someone you can work with, you may feel charitable enough to make up a press packet for him if you want to, consisting of: The Satanic Bible, the Nine Satanic Sins, the Eleven Rules of the Earth, our five-point Pentagonal Revisionism, and the Satanic Bunco sheet. That will give him plenty to work from. With a television format, you'll probably be taped; with radio, you'll probably be interviewed live, interspersed with lots of commercial and weather breaks. Suggestions remain the same for both; present yourself well. You don't have to sweep into the studio with your cape billowing and ceremonial sword in hand. You'll have more of a sinister effect if you understate your power. Always wear your Baphomet pin-that says enough. Have your assistant with you quiet and watchful. With television and radio, request a tape of the entire show, uncut. Especially for television (unless it's a talk show panel format), they may interview you for two hours to get five minutes of on-screen time - you might as well have the rest of the tape to use for your own promotion, if you want. They'll promise it, and you probably won't get it, but you can demand it anyway. The same goes for requesting they show a shot of the Church of Satan address on screen briefly - they probably won't but at least you've asked. You aren't getting paid so you should get something out of it. In television interviews, especially panel set-ups of any kind, realize you'll only get 30 seconds at the end of the show to counter all the crap they've been saying about Satanists for the last half-hour or hour show, if they allow you to say anything at all. Prepare one or two lines you want to squeeze in and consider yourself lucky if you get them in. If you do get some time to answer real questions, don't feel obligated to answer their questions directly; use their questions as springboards to communicate the ideas you want to get across. Remember to always give credit where credit is due, mention The Satanic Bible, reveal as much of yourself as you feel comfortable, and enjoy the fact that you are providing certain people with inspiration and certain others with discomfort just by your presence. Don't answer questions about membership numbers, in your grotto or in the Church of Satan, or about specific activities, apart from assuring your listeners that we don't sacrifice animals or unbaptized babies. Information regarding the hierarchical structure of the Church of Satan, forms you are required to submit as Grotto Master, contents of this book membership numbers and grotto statistics are considered confidential and not for outside eyes. That is your answer to such questions: \"That is considered confidential information and I don't have the authority to answer that.\" Turn it around; ask them why they want to know. We have good reasons for not revealing membership statistics. If they were too low, most people would dismiss us as an insignificant movement; if our numbers were too high, they might feel too threatened. Never telegraph your punches. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Always remember you are a Satanist. You are no one's beggar. The media needs you, you don't need them. You aren't on the spot, they are. Don't do a dance for peoples' prurient satisfaction. As above-ground and popular as we may someday become, we are essentially a magical cabal. For magical purposes, parts of our organization will always remain secret. We don't need to be open to intense scrutiny just to satisfy everyone's curiosity. There may come a time when that will be productive, but that will be up to the Council of Nine to decide. If someone from the media approaches you regarding a piece that would be on a national or international level (a national television broadcast or national or international mainstream magazine), send details to Central Grotto IMMEDIATELY by way of overnight mail, or phone/fax/e-mail, if you have access to such a number. We will review the situation and instruct you on what course you should take. It is not within your scope to represent the Church of Satan on a national level without proper instruction and/or authorization. Once word gets around that you're a local reliable Satanic contact, you may be approached by local law enforcement investigators to aid in a specific case or give a general talk on the subject so their officers are more informed. Be cooperative and respectful. Most law enforcement people are level-headed about Satanism as a legitimate religion, since they have had to investigate many false claims of \"Satanic crimes\" and have found them to be groundless. Of course, there are always a few \"cops for Christ\" that have, in the past, used their positions of authority to feed Satanic hysteria, but this is generally the exception rather than the rule. You'll also no doubt be approached by high school and college students for interviews. Many will say they're working under a terrible deadline and don't have time to find or read the books, or that they want to hear it straight from a Satanist's mouth. Everybody's working under a tight deadline. They should have allowed enough time to do more comprehensive research. MAKE THEM READ THE BOOKS. That's what they were written for. Don't waste your time with interviewers or inquirers who don't respect you or your religion enough to do the minimal reading necessary to grasp our most elementary concepts. Don't spoonfeed people. Your time and energy are too precious. Let them read the books and come to one of your Elementary Satanism lectures. Then you won't be wasting your breath on only one person, you'll be enlightening a roomful of people at the same time. They may invite you to give a talk to their class. That's up to you. At least you'll be reaching an audience of more than one. Don't allow most people the satisfaction of your concentrated, personal attention. This leads us into a brief discussion of what should go on at an Introductory Satanism meeting. Many of the same pointers covered above also apply here. Again, there is nothing graven in stone about how often these meetings should take place, but once or twice a week, in various parts of your area, should allow interested parties an opportunity to get an idea of what Satanism is about. Dress well, have 1 or 2 Sentinels of large stature dressed in black positioned near the front and/or near the door, watching. Use A/V aids if you like-videos, books, ritual implements, background music, depending on how 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"elaborate you want to get. Have flyers and business cards offered on tables for people to take home with them. Plan to give a 20-30 minute talk. Most speakers arrange their notes on 3x5 index cards or scribble memory-joggers on a yellow legal pad to keep in front of them to glance at from time to time. These will remind you of the general topics you want to cover. After your talk, open the floor to a brief Q and A session. If their questions are interesting and your audience seems enthusiastic and receptive, you may want to break into informal discussion groups, have some coffee and stay as long as you all feel comfortable. During or after this period, approach those you feel may be more authentically aligned. Find out more about them. They may be Church of Satan members checking you out. Ask to see a membership card. If they seem like those who would be productive in your second-level activities, offer to let them apply for further involvement. One thing all Satanists must be increasingly reminded of, in media situations or any situation: Never tolerate religious discrimination. If someone, especially a media person, asks you a question that makes blatant assumptions of criminality about our religion (i.e., that we do human or animal sacrifices, that we act as a front for drug trafficking and child pornography, that we recruit teenagers into drug use and suicide, that we vandalize graveyards, etc.) don't let them get away with it. Keep drumming into them that we are a religious organization - not recognized political subversives, not a \"hate group\", not a cult, or a criminal cartel. Satanism is not a growing scourge that must be wiped out. It is your religion that gives your life meaning and happiness. You have a right to be gravely insulted by presumptions and false information promoted by those who feel threatened by us. Inflict perspective on them; see how it sounds if you substitute \"Jews\", \"Negroes\", \"gays\", or \"Mormons\" into what they just said about Satanists. Jews have, in the past, been painted as villains who drank the blood of Christian babies, in order to justify pogroms and purges. There is always the \"Other\" and, in our predominantly Christian culture, that's us. Also, don't allow yourself to be harassed, stalked or threatened by those people who are offended by your above-ground existence. Job discrimination or housing discrimination should be dealt with in the civil courts. Find a smart lawyer to represent you or go to the ACLU and force them to recognize Satanism as a protected religion. Any damage to you or your property, or threats based on your religion, are considered hate crimes and are taken very seriously by law enforcement officials (or they should be. If they don't put it in the context of hate crimes, remind them). Don't run to the police every time someone accidentally steps on your toe; save their support for when you really need it. But don't run scared, or be intimidated by self-righteous imbeciles who haven't bothered to find out anything about your religion before attacking it. As far as people coming to your meetings just to harass or heckle the Satanist, don't feed back to them. The situation could very easily escalate into something dangerous. That's why you should never hold a public meeting without the presence of at least one other Satanist. You don't need a gang of friends with you (unless the situation warrants it) but it's pragmatic to have one or two aforementioned Sentinels close at hand. Satanic Sentinels can have a quieting effect on any rabble rousers. Use your Lesser Magic skills to defuse the situation, before it gets ugly. Don't be baited into pointless interchanges of 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"words or increasing levels of damage; it can go nowhere. Ignore them; give them nothing to fight against, unless they actually damage you, your property, or are a real and present threat to your safety, or to those you love. As a Satanist, you must ultimately realize that, as Dr. LaVey wrote in The Satanic Bible, persistent shit disturbers are masochists and they pick on you because you're the toughest guy on the block. They secretly hope you'll beat the shit out of them if they goad you enough. If every attempt to mitigate the situation fails, use whatever magical or physical powers at your disposal to give them exactly what they deserve. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Section Three Direction and Destiny 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"It's all too easy to become bogged down in administrative duties, expectations, do's and don'ts and lose sight of our greater power and greater goals. Why are we doing this? What are we working toward? Concentration is essential for all of us, as individuals and as a movement. As a Grotto Master, you should act as an immediate arm of the Church of Satan, a medium through which Satanists can be more concretely connected to Central Grotto. We advocate principles of apprenticeships and mentoring, magically and professionally, among our productive members. It's your role to help those of value in your grotto. If you can advise them, assist them in their magical quest or hook them up with another professional in their chosen field, do so. You should consider your grotto meetings as training grounds for yourself and for your grotto members, encouraging that sense of wider purpose that makes life fulfilling. Your general duties are two-fold. You can consider these \"mundane responsibilities\" and \"magical responsibilities\", equivalent to Lesser and Greater Magic: A) Mundane - To act as a clearinghouse for accurate information about Satanism and the Church of Satan; to get the truth of Satanism out to the right people, who seek it, are ready to hear it, and can benefit from it. You are expected to clear up misapprehensions about Satanism and, for second-level members, to provide a forum for professional Satanic networking. B) Magical - To exhibit that Truth through your actions, success, bearing and activities; to stimulate, broaden, entice. Be a role model and vision for your grotto members. Enact, manifest and evoke Satan in the concrete world through your actions. Open the Gates and provide a channel through which Satan can act; provide spiritual sustenance and inspiration by allowing Satanically-aligned individuals to come together to generate very potent energy. Imagine what people want to see in Satanists and Satanism, reflect on what role we play as the Accusers in society, be attuned to the best of what people who are not Satanists need to believe about us and what Satanists want to imagine for themselves: Give them that. To be an effective Magician, you need unerring powers of evocation and imagination, to inspire, tickle and spur your members to new perspectives and joie de vivre. That's your highest function as a Grotto Master, and where your strongest magic will manifest itself. You should discourage members from involving themselves in your second-level activities if you sense they're just looking for friends or lovers, or collecting Satanic names and phone numbers, or looking for something exciting to do. Your motives, and theirs, should be periodically re-evaluated. Your active goals might be: To possess and further develop principles and leadership skills that you should apply toward your greater success in the outside world. Goals for individual members might be: To make professional contacts, and develop skills to advance in the real world. To gain inspiration, a sense of direction and cohesion of values through interacting with other Satanists. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Goals for the grotto and the Church of Satan as a whole might be: To effect the world as a growing, unified Satanic force, to further Open the Gates and allow Satan and his minions to manifest their Will in the workings of the Material Realm, to express through actions the positive aspects of Satanism. One of the ways we can enact these ambitions is to always remember the vital importance of dress and decorum. If you can't afford a luxurious home, your surroundings should at least be distinctive, and dramatically furnished. You don't have to buy a new car every three years, but it should be unusual. Satanists are seldom fashionable, but they always command respect. Women Grotto Masters may choose to be tawdry and tasteless, according to the precepts of The Satanic Witch, using their sexuality to confound and enchant. This can be especially effective if you have a brain to go with it. Teach your members that the conduct of each individual Satanist reflects directly on our entire organization. If we are to be regarded as the elite of society we must act the part. Our \"global village\" has forsaken standards of rationality, objectivity, competence, justice, and demonstrable skills. If we are to survive, we must revive them, quickly. We must usher in a renewed standard of strength and competence in Satan's name. We must spearhead a new Renaissance. We will set a new pace; others will step into line with us or be left behind. One question you will confront, from both Satanists and outsiders alike, is, \"Since Satanists don't believe in a supernatural deity guiding their lives, is Satanism a religion, or is it a philosophy?\" To die-hard rationalists among us, Satanism has been described as an anti-religion, or \"militant atheism\". Do we still need religion? Do you need a religion to establish a family, raise kids, create a productive community? And is Satanism inherently opposed to this type of institutional structure? These are important points to clarify if Satanism is going to survive beyond one or two generations. To examine them, we must look at the purpose of religion, and if Satanism satisfies that purpose. Religion evolved to explain natural phenomena that we couldn’t understand, but, more importantly, to dictate to a group of people what is and isn't acceptable behavior. One person on a desert island wouldn't need ethics or morality, but add one other person and you've got to have common rules of conduct. We have to be able to get along with people or nothing gets done. That's why the Ten Commandments were established. Rape, murder, stealing, looting,.. .these things that are harmful to a community must be agreed- upon. Rationalists would urge these established rules be taught as ethics, not morality. But we don't live in a unation of philosophers\" and most people need to be afraid of supernatural retribution to compel them to act justly and fairly. Satanists hear this presupposition all the time in comments like, \"Well, gee-if you don't believe in God or Hell, that means you're free to kill or steal from anybody you want!\", immediately assuming we need the same kind of \"fear of God\" they do to act responsibly to our fellow creatures. Religions generally provide the supernatural Big Brother to put some force behind the rules. Other people may not know everything you do but GOD knows who's been naughty and nice (by whatever name he's called), and you'll pay dearly if you dare step out of line. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"But, says the rationalist, these practical needs for an ethical society can be easily approached without the mythical veneer imposed by a religion. Is a religious context necessary?, or does it leave the door to mumbo-jumbo open too wide? Do the benefits outweigh the possible intellectual abuses? How is a religion different from a philosophy, and does Satanism qualify as a religion? Modern Satanism, as defined by Anton LaVey, is still relatively new, and there are people who agree with his philosophy but who don't want to hang the pejorative label of \"Satanist\" around their necks. People who are timid about the label but who still find themselves agreeing with the commonsense aspects of LaVey’s religion will probably call themselves atheists\" or \"humanists\" or \"agnostics\" or even \"Wiccans\". They'll be comfortable using the Devil's tools, but not taking His name. And they won't be Satanists. You can't embrace the militant rationality of Satanism and not utilize the images of Satan in a ritualistic sense. The two are inextricably bound together. They always have been. That is what makes it a religion and not a philosophy. A religion is a metaphorical language that a group of people agree to respect and be guided by. It must: A) Communicate values and standards to a group of people through metaphorical role models; B) Provide a sense of belonging, continuance and community through common rituals and ceremonies; and C) Provide spiritual or psychic sustenance by allowing us an archetypal language with which to conjure forth greater strength and power within ourselves. Neither atheism nor humanism (nor Ayn Rand's \"Objectivism\") qualify as religions because they don't have any body of archetypes to draw from, nothing to orient your life. They don't pretend to be religions, and many people find them dissatisfying, limiting. Remember that there must always remain some mystery surrounding the Church of Satan or we will have lost our essence. As aboveground and popular as we may someday become, there must remain some cherished inner mysteries. This is not to say there should be \"shrouded knowledge\" that is false knowledge, used as a carrot to dangle and tempt people with. On the contrary, we have the potential to bring mystery and portent into the world, to feed the archetypal needs of the collective unconscious and that is what will make the Church of Satan immortal. Think of all the most intriguing movies you've seen about a mysterious Satanic group, or books you've read (without the human sacrifice part necessary to give the hero something real to fight against) about this whispered secret society. Every culture has invented myths of sinister people working as the real powerbase behind the scenes and carrying out diabolical rites. UFOs, the mafia, classified government agencies, MIBs (Men in Black), the International Jewish Bankers, the Satanic conspiracy-by whatever name, every society needs Aliens. We are that. By giving people access to our literature and resources, we don't want to dispel that magic and consequent power. 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"In practical terms this simply means you should remain quiet about certain things until or unless the individual is worthy of knowing what you know. Create a sense of intrigue. You don't have to blurt out to everyone that you are a Grotto Master. Let them \"accidentally\" overhear someone call you \"Master\" and let their minds race. You don't have to broadcast at your general information lectures that we have a web of grottos around the world - approach certain people that you feel are promising and let them know. Invite them to apply to your group. If someone asks you directly, practice creative evasiveness-don't appear nervous about it, simply make sly, vague references and let them pull the pieces together. It will be more fun for your inquirer to play \"The Discovery Game\" (as Dr. LaVey calls it) and, most importantly, the mystery will add to your power. Magic is Metaphor. That doesn't mean it is \"less real\"; it means you have to move into a new realm of understanding in order to be privy to the fabulously intricate web of magical existence. When asked (and you will be asked, again and again), \"Do you or don't you believe in Satan?\", just smile slyly and reply, \"Satan is the metaphorical context we find most stimulating and productive. I don't expect you to understand. If you did, you'd be a Satanist.\" Non-Satanists don't understand. Satanists understand intuitively because, for them, there is no choice. Their path was decided for them long before they were born. We live only to act as mediums for the Dark Legions and to fulfill our interwoven destiny. As with most magic, it can be explained by a concept of physics: It is a matter of frequency. Satanists vibrate to one frequency, people of other religions vibrate to others. Satanists find those other frequencies jarring and harmful. People of other religions find Satanism grating and harmful. Always remember Dunninger's Dictum: \"For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't believe, no explanation is possible.\" You are a Satanist because that is all you can be. You were born a Satanist. It is your resonance. Others who are sincere about their religion resonate just as truly to the metaphors and images of Christianity, or Buddhism, or Judaism. How do we reconcile our material references to Satan with our disdain for \"spiritual\" religions? Isn't that hypocritical? If you don't understand this bedrock concept, you aren't a Satanist. We understand that a religion's \"spirituality\" is simply the metaphorical context those adherents find most productive. Their spiritual icon embodies all that they hold true and admirable. The difference is that we recognize the process of the metaphorical construct; other religions blind themselves to it. Their leaders are frightened of rational examination and try to keep their followers stupid and tractable. Satan demands more of his followers. Lucifer resented and resisted the demands for blind faith and mindless adoration in heaven - that's why he led his prideful rebellion. Why do you call yourself a Satanist, instead of an Atheist, or Humanist? The references in this book are to be taken in the Satanic context. We create. We make concrete by invoking the Power within ourselves and giving it shape. We assign the dreaded Name. What happens in the ritual chamber is a reflection of what should be happening in your life. You must reflect Satan, your grotto must reflect Satan - giving him breath, life, flesh, substance, alchemically transforming particles and atoms to conform to his existence. That is the unlimited power of the human mind and force, guided through metaphor and 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"symbols and language. You create your life-by choosing a metaphor, an image of the Is To Be, by giving it enough energy to make it concrete, and existing there already. It is a process that takes place both in the mind and the heart. We intellectually recognize the process; we choose to enter the subjective state, objectively. We do not blindly follow and bow. The God created by the Judeo-Christians is a petulant, childish, inconsistent, unjust God - we defy him eternally. We pridefully take it upon ourselves to create Satan in our own image, to recognize that's what we're doing and to venerate him as we venerate ourselves. Satan does exist. We summon him into existence from the Black Void of nonexistence; we define him with our philosophy, our rituals, our tenets, our actions, our bearing and our growing force in the world; we honor him as we honor ourselves - with every breath, every thought, every act, every movement. We are Satan; Satan is us. Our destinies are interdependent. As we succeed, so shall the body of Satan, so shall we all. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Section Four Devils Together 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The preceding section explains all the noble, productive reasons Satanists form grottos. But there are bound to be ego conflicts and problems among the most cooperative people, let alone among people who pride themselves on their defiance and self-centeredness. Is it unnatural for productive Satanists to work together? Not if we keep our motives in mind, and pattern ourselves after wolf packs and other animals who find it necessary to form groups for survival in the wild. Of course there are jealousies and maneuverings for position within the pack. But there is also cohesion and purpose. Ideally, your grotto should eventually act as one cell, one team, a ship's crew - your job is to encourage that. Satanists should develop a reputation for being clannish, for depending on each other, for sticking together - offend one and you offend us all. This kind of dedication is only developed over time. It can also only come if we are ruthlessly selective in our alliances. We don't want to cheapen or compromise our quality, pulling us all down; Above all, be selective in who you admit into your inner circle. Three people who are aligned are much more productive, inside and outside the ritual chamber, than twenty people who aren't wholly dedicated. You don't need a group of \"followers\" to satisfy your ego needs; achieving the status you have in the organization shows that you are respected and valued by those who count. We are not an initiatory organization, meaning you don't have to be initiated into a grotto to be a practicing, recognized Satanist. You don't even have to be a member of the Church of Satan to call yourself a Satanist. Dr. LaVey wrote his books so that anyone who picked them up would be able to understand Satanism, and immediately benefit from his concepts. You may find it most productive to not even tell people there are second-level or grotto \"activities\" per se within the Church of Satan unless you consider them worthy of inclusion and invite them into your inner circle of active participants. Then no one will set his or her sights on such involvement and be disappointed or angry when you have to reject him. You may well find you must reject most applicants if you have an \"open enrollment\" policy. It's better to keep it strictly by invitation only. Satanism's strength isn't in millions of people shouting \"Hail Satan!\" It may be inevitable that will happen someday, but our strength will still come from having the right people share our ideals. You'll never know where the true Satanists are, or where the members of the Order of the Trapezoid are. They are sworn not to disclose their positions, only to act in accordance with our plans. We don't ever want to be ghettoized and thereby contained and vanquished. All other religions (Wicca and Christianity included) have become philosophically and spiritually bankrupt and now only offer fellowship. We have a strong religion that doesn't require \"getting together\". It stands on its own merit and so do Satanists. In most group situations, the strong inevitably end up monopolized by the weaker members, their time and energy diverted to nonproductive or counterproductive pursuits. Often, too many people are more interested in collecting addresses and friends than in evoking change or attaining magical/material success. With too much aboveground focus, there is little room left for mystery, imagination or magic. On the other hand, grottos can supercharge us, direct and inspire us, and provide 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"professional contacts and support. Within the Church of Satan, we've had thesis and antithesis regarding open grotto activities – now we have an opportunity for synthesis. We'll be able to maintain these policies as long as we all recognize certain pitfalls and do our best to avoid them. There are risks involved, but significant rewards possible, as well. This is a primary way for us to grow and succeed. If we keep in mind that group activities are supposed to be an enjoyable adjunct to what we're doing as Satanists, not a primary goal in itself, we'll keep group interaction in its proper perspective. Grottos often fall apart because Satanists begin to take them too seriously, imagining that grottos are the main thrust of the Church of Satan. This can manifest itself in the following ways: 1) Lack of cooperation among members. Instead of concentrating on our common goals, some members tend to undermine cohesion by concentrating on the differences among us. Satanists share much, but we can also be very different from each other. Some begin complaining that they don't like this person or that person because he's black or she's too mystical or he's a Nazi or she's a black metal fan. One kind of Satanist develops a disdain for everybody else, figuring he's got the \"true path\" and everybody else is doing it all wrong. You must put these aside if you want to interact in a group – any group. Certain compromises are always necessary. You have to weigh whether what you are getting out of the group is worth the compromises you have to make. As Grotto Master, you may engineer certain psychodrama rituals and Black Masses to help exorcise these problems, as long as the rituals don't turn into an excuse for encounter group \"confrontations.\" 2) The best people are drained by the demands of less-advanced members. They eventually feel they're getting very little energy from the interchange, are being vampirized, and that their valuable energies could be better applied toward their own selfish pursuits. This cycle could be described as a \"Sons of the Desert\" syndrome, where a group degenerates into a situation in which the strong are expected to support the weak. This is against Satanic principles. A Grotto Master might explore three possible solutions- A) Make sure the more advanced members are getting enough support and attention from you. Give energy and attention to those who deserve it. Don't make the mistake that public schools make, concentrating on the \"slow\" students, figuring the sharper ones can take care of themselves. Make sure the focus of the group is evenly divided between lower-level activities and more advanced activities. Group members should be recognized for their positions in the outside world and dedication to Satanic principles, not by how much time and energy they \"devote\" to the grotto; their devotion may be based largely on ego needs and lack of advancement in the outside world. Recognize psychic vampires before they drain you dry. B) Inspire more advanced members to understand our greater goals and purpose. They must feel they are getting something valuable from their continued active involvement-a 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"sense of cohesion with the wider organization, a feeling of inspiration and support among fellow Satanists. C) Realize that grotto activities, while vitally important at certain stages of magical development, are not as important as achievements in the real world. If an advanced member feels torn between his grotto participation and his professional or family commitments, release him from feelings of obligation, encourage him to pursue his own path to success and assure him his link to you and to the Church of Satan will be strengthened by his achievements. 3) Contentiousness. There are people who often hide behind Satanism's advocacy of individual freedoms, and use it as an excuse to criticize you, Anton LaVey and others active in the Satanic network. They are usually jealous, overintellectualizing nit-pickers who love to challenge and stir up controversy. They'll use whatever forums they can to do it-whether it's us or the armed services or any other group. It's a lifestyle for them, a character flaw. They'll work to undermine your authority, bird-dog after others' names, addresses and personal information, and eventually abandon your group to start their own. But not before inciting divisions and arguments within your grotto. The key to avoiding this kind of problem is simply early detection and repulsion. These people cannot be reasoned with or changed-they stir up shit wherever they go. Your best teacher will be experience. You'll learn to recognize them, through their baiting questions, constant unnecessary challenge and avid networking with other Satanists. When you do recognize them, toss them out without fanfare and give them no more attention. They will feed on debating with you. Starve them out. Keeping the above in mind, we do require a certain level of discipline in our grottos. Most Satanists are inherently self-disciplined. Dress code for most grotto meetings should be appropriate - dresses or skirts with stockings and heels for women, jackets for men (no jeans and t-shirts). We should show respect for each other and pride in ourselves. Your members should get in the habit of bringing their ritual robes to second-level meetings, even if no ritual is scheduled – you may have reason to call one rather spontaneously. Black robes should be worn over street clothes for rituals, donned before entering the ritual chamber or area. We don't require discipline in the arbitrary sense of wearing tightly-regulated uniforms and the right color Baphomet for a particular degree, but we do demand the kind of discipline necessary for cohesion and coordination. We must have efficient channels for quick communication and mobilization. That cannot happen without some fair amount of discipline and warranted respect for a chain of command. Satanists aren't required to participate in grotto activities. But if they choose to do so, they are expected to respect these dictates and act when necessary. As a Grotto Master, you'll find you're in a peculiarly demanding position. If you are an ineffective Grotto Master, other Church of Satan members won't respect you enough to value your opinion one way or another, you won't engender any trust or cooperation, and your members will drop out quickly. If, on the other hand, you are an effective Grotto Master, your troubles may be worse. Your members will vie for your approval like little 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"children, exhibiting jealousy and throwing tantrums when they don't get the attention they think they deserve. Your task will be to use your leadership skills to remain balanced, resolve conflicts and keep moving forward on the momentum you've generated. Remember what Dr. LaVey has written - the two most precious things people have, the things they covet most are IDENTITY and STIMULATION. This goes for the best of us, as well as for psychic vampires who just want to latch onto a good thing for their own purposes. Re-read the first point in our Pentagonal Revisionism. Stratification is always a primary goal. Weed out the vampires and your best members will still look to you for identity and stimulation. Give them a sense of cohesion, of identity, and give them stimulation and direction. Recognize strengths and weaknesses of each member and assign tasks accordingly. They aren't equal, they're different and you'll feel differently about each one. Involve each member by assigning responsibilities according to what he does best. Draw out the \"kids in the back of the class\", the neglected, orphaned, and overlooked, who may turn out to have a lot more going for them than the ones who aggressively demand attention. Give each Satanist a taste of authority by allowing different people to compose and conduct rituals as they feel comfortable doing it. This is a great way for them to get experience as authorities and leaders. In preparing for rituals, assign roles beforehand and have repeated run-throughs so all participants know where they're supposed to stand, what they're supposed to do, so everything runs smoothly. Who's in charge of music? Who's in charge of lights? These details should be assigned appropriately so the presentation is polished. Whether your ritual involves three people or thirty-the illusion and consequent magical effect depend on it. When petty, unfocused conflicts arise, try not to play one person off another. Listen to each complaint but allow members the responsibility of working it out themselves. It's a fool's game if you try to take sides in a manufactured battle; they'll end up carrying tales to each other about what you said and use it to plant seeds of distrust. Allow them to use you as a sounding board, voicing frustrations to you, confident that what they say won't go any further. The less said by you, the better. If you feel it necessary, you can suggest, without placing blame. If there a clear injustice going on, you should take sides and take action. Your tough job as a leader will be to evaluate clearly when you should intervene and when you shouldn't. Don't come running to Central Grotto to mediate minor squabbles. It's your responsibility to resolve conflicts. It will serve you well, developing skills that will apply in managerial situations outside the Church of Satan. Many of our most powerful Satanists are very private people, and resist disclosing much about themselves, either because they're intensely private or because they would be vulnerable if other people knew too many details about their lives. You don't have to ask personal questions, or demand they give you their life's history, where they work or live, if they have kids or what their ethnic background is. You don't need all this information to know whether they're valuable or not. Don't challenge them or demand disclosure or you might alienate your most valuable Advocates. Allow each individual to set a distance that's comfortable for him. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In any intimate group situation, you have to be willing to take chances with each other and expose your weaknesses, which is difficult for most Satanists. This doesn't mean physically risking or making yourself vulnerable in any way. But on an interpersonal level-the chances taken in participating, showing different sides of yourself, and sometimes looking silly, exposing your weaknesses and fallibility along with your strengths - is sometimes more than people want to be involved in. Satanists can be very closed about what we expose to people, often adopting a menacing posture from childhood as a defense mechanism for survival. But we can also be drawn to the other extreme, familiarity escalating swiftly with people we choose to be closest to, spending so much time together we develop a shorthand with each other and almost read each others' minds. You and your group will develop an intimacy level that is comfortable for all of you. Your grotto should be part theatrical troupe and part street gang. If one of your members would benefit from a show of strength and you consider him worthy, assign your grotto's strength to support him. This sometimes takes nothing more than having a small group of people in black Suits or conservative dress hanging around - not threatening or saying anything, just scowling a lot. A camera or video camera at the right time, in the right direction, can be most effective. The point is to practice cooperation and support. We don't need critics; most of us are our own worst critics. Don't hold encounter group meetings; don't encourage manipulations, jealousies, and petty maneuverings. The Church of Satan was founded as a mutual admiration society, where vital people who were interested in the Black Arts could come together, practice magic and share their obsessions. It's up to you as Grotto Master to draw out the best in your people. It's up to you to see problems coming and defuse them before they have a chance to build up pressure and explode. Because of our growth, we'll have to administrate, direct and advise to a certain extent. But we don't need to nursemaid. Don't foster an atmosphere of dependency and manipulation. Magic, like writing and other arts, cannot be taught. A magician must create a uniquely personal own path to his own magical success. Your members must be allowed to rise or fall on their own merits, must be allowed to stratify themselves. Consider it a form of magical Darwinism. You are doing them a terrible disservice if you lead them by the nose. Ideally, how we interact in our grottos are practical exercises in Lesser Magic, as well as Greater Magic - lessons in strategy, in getting along with people, professional networking, communicating effectively, expanding cultural literacy, formalizing attitudes and ideas, training for quick reactions and sharp wits, developing concentration and honing our blades to be applied toward success outside the group. That's what the grotto is for - to inspire and assist in a concrete way toward all of our earthly success. 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Section Five Leadership: Strength and Strategy 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Many of the pitfalls described in the previous section can be avoided through deft leadership. Your grotto members will respect you because you are presumed to be further along your Magical Path than they are. You prove that through concrete demonstration- you must be able to come up with the goods in order to invoke trust and respect from your group. Satanism and the activities of your grotto should be an adjunct to your successful life, not a meager substitute for the real dominance or authority you long for in the outside world. If you applied for Grotto Master status because you are impotent and felt the Church of Satan would be an artificial system in which you could assert authority by passing the right tests or achieving the right degrees, you came to the wrong place. You will be quickly frustrated and discarded. The majority of people who apply for Grotto Master status, do so out of sincere dedication to the principles of Satanism. They want to come forward to do something, to make sure Dr. LaVey’s ideas are communicated and enacted accurately, and to allow others to have a local gathering point to energize and focus us all. It takes a Hell of a lot of energy to lead a group well, and at the same time, advance in your chosen professional field, and juggle family responsibilities. But you have been Called to this course, for better or worse, or you would never have applied. You are promised an overwhelming magical experience, one way or another. Hang on tight and enjoy the ride. If leadership can be said to consist of strength and strategy, you have the strength - first by dint of being a Satanist, second by the authority of being a member of the Church of Satan, and further by being an approved Grotto Master of the Church of Satan. You should communicate this strength in every move. Stand straight, lower your voice, speak at a measured pace. Eye contact should be used as a weapon. Don't blink constantly – it communicates dishonesty and nervousness. Look over the head of the person you're talking to, or beyond him, until the time is right for you to look directly at him - then skewer him with your eyes, as if you can see into his very soul. Strategy comes from clear- headed observation, experience in projecting anticipated moves and acting to counter or utilize those anticipated moves. Observe, anticipate, act. Never telegraph your actions to an enemy; surprise is stimulating to friends and enemies alike. Success will come to you only if you build momentum in a particular direction, anticipating and funneling the energy to conform to your will. This is where strategy (as it applies to magical workings) can best be seen. There are dozens of books you can look to and seminars you can attend to help you develop leadership skills and help in conflict resolution. You may find many of these useful. As a Satanist, you can put your magical imagination to work for you. Align yourself with a metaphor of leadership that motivates you best: a movie or stage director, an orchestra conductor, a business maven, a ship's captain, a military general or political leader....You are all of these and can draw strength from focusing on such images. Your most obvious example of a stimulating, responsible leader is Satan himself. Let your 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"actions and advice reflect him. Attempt to evoke and engender a sense of nobility, of measure, an elegant union of purpose and metaphorical context. Counsel but don't dictate. We expect our Grotto Masters to provide direction, to offer accurate and caring advice based on greater experience and wisdom. As Dr. LaVey has instructed in the Eleven Rules, advise when asked but don't allow yourself to be drained by constant demands. If an individual is a clear drain on your time, you should suggest the person go elsewhere if he persists in vampirizing you and your group. You are responsible for recognizing and weeding out disruptive elements at a grassroots level. Forestall problems if you can before they harm the cohesion of the group. Again, experience will be your best teacher. We all make mistakes in judgment and you'll learn very quickly more about people and group dynamics than you probably ever wanted to know. Leaders must be decisive and reassuring in order to engender loyalty in your grotto members. Respect for you and camaraderie with one another cannot be imposed or dictated; it must be earned and nurtured. The Church of Satan can grant you permission to be a Grotto Master and give you the right tools - but you will earn the title when other Church of Satan members call you \"Master\" freely and without prompting. In making decisions or plans, use rational decision-making skills, but also depend on intuition. This is where your magical training comes to the fore. Know when to jump, when to go forward, when to pull back and let a situation mellow for awhile. Timing is everything. Scare your members once in a while. Perform some cold readings and some stage magic. Baffle them. They need to be assured that you know more than they do and are capable of leading them. They'll be thrilled and impressed. You will, eventually, engender a sense of trust and security in your grotto members. No matter what happens, no matter how weird or wild things get, your people have to have faith in you, trust that you'll make fair decisions, have confidence that you'll direct them competently and lead them through to safety. This only comes with time and proving your competence to them again and again. Ultimately, these tasks you've undertaken should be a magical learning expedition for you. To get the most from your grotto work, examine your own motives ruthlessly. This position demands you look in the mirror and ask yourself hard questions: Why did I want to be a Grotto Master? What do I expect to get out of it? Am I achieving what I expected I would? Am I fulfilling my greater purpose? Your primary emphasis should always be on you. The Church of Satan has granted endorsement to you as a Satanist; we don't assign Grotto Charters, per se. The moment grotto activities begin to drain you, drop them. In the language of the Elements, groups can be quite transient – very liquid, or airy. You must be fire and earth-immutable and steadfast. Don't despair or be discouraged if your grotto disintegrates. It may not be a reflection on your leadership abilities. Quite the contrary. Grotto activities ultimately have to take a backseat to your personal success in the outside world. They are meant as an adjunct to an already thriving life, not as your sole identity. Fulfill your dreams in the 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"real world. That's how you can best serve yourself, best act as a role model for your group and other members, and can eventually serve the best interests of the Church of Satan. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Section Six Satanic Spirituality 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"As we discussed in Section Three, the power of Satanism lies just as much in its metaphorical strength as in its advocacy of uncompromising rationality. Some Satanists prefer to use the term \"magic\" instead of \"spirituality\" because magic is active; spirituality implies passivity. Whatever term you feel comfortable with, we are different from atheists or humanists. We use rituals and symbols, talismans and invocations to call forth the Dark Gods within us. We must speak in metaphors, not to be purposely obfuscating but for two valid reasons: 1) It is the only language the Ones Without understand. They are like animals. They may not entirely understand the words we speak. What they understand are the vibrations of our language, our emotions and the thought-forms we use to focus Them. 2) Because we, as Satanic Magicians, are pioneers exploring vast, uncharted territories, and only poetic language is able to reach into the furthest borderlands of our comprehension. Magic is alchemical physics. We live in a spiral galaxy, our genetic code is a helix. Perhaps our physics and our magic would work differently in another galaxy, but here, everything can be reduced to frequencies and waves (which are only spirals seen from a fixed, limited perspective). Everything is spirals, not direct recapitulations. Energy is never wasted. Acquired knowledge confers further individuation, and consequently more individual power. If the Satanist has \"faith\", he has unshakable faith in the power of his own mind. The best of us are curious, imaginative, inventive, determined creatures, worthy of sincere admiration. All we have theorized about all our sciences may crumble tomorrow - but only because we could conjure forth the defiant courage necessary to smash everything we know in order to understand even more completely. The sciences admit what Magicians have known for aeons – no action takes place in a vacuum. As a race of Satanists, we are all interconnected. We vibrate together. No experience, no memory stands alone; no Satanist stands alone. What strengthens one of us, strengthens us all. What is a weakness in someone we choose to embrace sends ripples of weakness throughout our web. That is why we must encourage strength in ourselves and in each other; why we must hesitate to embrace those who would compromise our power, and why we must purge those who challenge or weaken us. As a Grotto Master, you are acting as an extension of the High Priest, touching members and prospective members in a direct way on behalf of the Church of Satan. Satanists are strange creatures. We know that the idea of an omniscient, all-powerful god who watches over each of us and listens to each of our prayers is an irrationality and a deep offense to any advanced mind. We see no evidence of justice or answered prayers in the world around us. If the Judeo-Christian \"God\" is all-powerful, all-knowing, he's damned churlish and incompetent. But the Satanist is also faced with his subjective experience of what we choose to characterize as \"Satan\" in our lives. Satan is a very personal Companion. We admire Satan and wish to gain his respect, therefore we act as he would - in defiance of anything or anyone who would demand our worship. It would be an insult to offer him unthinking 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"worship. But this is fact: Unlike the promises of the Christians, Satan does develop an intensely intimate relationship with each of his followers. You may not perceive it until you train yourself to sense it, but since you have achieved the position of Grotto Master, You have probably already been touched by it. He will remain with you until your breath leaves your body. And perhaps beyond. Denying that reality - one based on our own personal experience and senses - would be any equal offense to our own minds. Therefore, we accept it for what it is, revel in it and explore it. We are the only ones who are able to explore these realms objectively, since we are the only ones who seem able to blend the rational and the irrational. This subjective reality can only be accessed through metaphor, allusion, evocation, music, poetry, scents and magic. There is no necessity for the Satanist to ask, \"Is it real or isn't it?\" It's both. We recognize concepts beyond black and white, beyond good and evil (as Nietzsche put it); we won't be stifled by false dichotomies but instinctively follow the Third Way. We must always remember Anton LaVey’s words - the key to Satanic ritual (and life) is to enter the subjective state, objectively. Never allow yourself to be baited into this false \"issue\" of spiritual reality versus non- reality. Anton LaVey did what no philosopher or religious writer before him had done - reconciled the mind and the soul. Let's not be forced by our enemies into compromising that truth. Satan is the reconciliation of apparent irreconcilables. Blind faith is a cancer - it must be eradicated, along with all claims that anyone dangles the keys to all mysteries in front of your nose, making you jump for them, or retreating to \"diabolical revelations\" to prove their worth. Satan is the enemy of blind faith and mystical obfuscation. Breathe, feel, live and know - not by faith but by bedazzling apprehension. It's a razor's edge we walk. The rational part of us shudders to balance so close along the precipice, edging toward a fall into mysticism that can only lead to folly and self- delusion. On the other hand, we refuse to render Satan impotent through overintellectualizing. It isn't so difficult to find a balance. To us, it comes naturally. It's the only existence possible to us - the Third Way. If you sense among many Satanists an extreme distaste for any hint of mysticism, it's because we value our rationality and wouldn't want our religion to sink into the morass of mindlessness we've all gagged on over the years. Language defines thought, and it's all too easy to drift into patterns of speech that constantly refer to a diabolical entity, eventually shifting the focus of our power outside rather than inside ourselves. In a Christian- dominated society, the \"all-powerful, all-knowing\" is all too familiar; it requires fortitude to counterbalance such pervasiveness. Simple minds require broad strokes and it dilutes the richness inherent in Satanism to overemphasize its spiritual elements at the expense of its championing of the rational. That is what makes it different as a religion. That's why you became a Satanist - why most of us did. Spiritual religions depend on blinding their followers, creating a climate of ignorance and fear. In place of logic, they use revelation to justify their tenets. That sickens us, and we battle it every day in its most modern guises. It would make it all too easy for Christians, 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Wiccans, or any other mystical adherents to relate to us by simply substituting \"our God\" for \"their God\". They would breathe a big sigh of relief, but Satan's will wouldn't be fulfilled. We cannot allow them that luxury. We are the Accusers. We demand the whys and wherefores. We refuse to be intellectually defined and limited. We must utilize our metaphoric imagination, but must never use it as an excuse for intellectual flaccidity. Satanism must smash with a broadsword all the lies that have bound scientific and social progress, retarding us for centuries. The very separation between spirit and intellect is a holdover from dualistic thinking. We must never be lulled or diverted. The Satanic community must not be split by this ridiculous nondebate. If it is, it will only prove that we aren't ready for the satisfaction of true Satanism but must continue an unnecessary struggle against ghosts of our own making. To manifest our spiritual connection with each other and with the Satanic Realms, we perform magical rituals. How much emphasis you place on rituals in your grotto is a matter of personal taste. Some people don't feel a need to go into the ritual chamber very often, but feel they are performing rituals all day long. Advanced magicians summon a sense of ritual into many creative or social or professional settings. New Satanists often feel a compulsion to perform formal rituals. This need is certainly valid and should be encouraged. They want to work magic; they want to see if it really works; they want to declare their allegiance in a formal way, with their fellow Satanists as witnesses. This is an important phase of passage that helps set our \"frequency\" - that attunes us to the Satanic all around us, making us aligned with the Demons of the Pit and with our Sinister brothers and sisters. Once this attunement is established, it becomes self-generating. Formal rituals become more of a rare, potent indulgence. You will probably find your members request more rituals than you find necessary, but that's why you're a Grotto Master. Your ritual activities should balance out your more mundane gatherings. If you spend a lot of time together as a group, you should perform more rituals to balance out the mundane time. You should perform grotto initiations for your active members (a sample Initiation ritual is in Appendix B) and you can find Satanic baptisms described in The Satanic Rituals. You may want to have Friday night rituals, Full Moon or Dark of the Moon rituals, or celebrations for the Solstices and Equinoxes. Your grotto will probably want to celebrate Halloween and Walpurgisnacht, and you may want to devise birthday rituals for your participants, as this is the highest Satanic holiday. There are two basic types of ceremonial gatherings - one for a specific purpose (as the three described in The Satanic Bible) and one for simple communion. This second kind of ritual is your way to let your Dark Master know that you are enacting his Will on the Earth, that you respect him and his principles, and that you wish to feel inspired and touched by his approval. Most rituals for a purpose are also rituals of respect and communion, of course. But it's also a valid impulse to want to do a ritual just because you feel like it. You shouldn't have to wait for a particular important night or purpose. Follow your instincts and move when the time is right. That is part of developing your magical sensitivity. Review the five ingredients for success in Satanic magic, as described in The Satanic Bible. Read LaVey’s works again and again. It's all there. If you truly understand and 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"apply these five principles, not only in the ritual chamber but also outside the ritual chamber, your success is guaranteed. Meditate upon them: Desire, Timing, Imagery, Direction, and the Balance Factor. Concerning the actual mechanics of your rituals, many people ask if it's essential to use a nude altar in a small gathering. Nude altars are a way of reinforcing and utilizing the interaction between masculine and feminine forces. The female altar is the direct line to Satan and his minions; she is the battery. The Priest focuses and directs that raw energy. If you are working alone, or with a small group, the Priest or Priestess will be able to generate sufficient energy on his or her own. But if you have enough participants to warrant it, if the altar is enthusiastic and you've weeded out disruptive elements and/or those who would only be at the ritual to see a nude woman, the traditional female nude altar can add force to your ceremony. This is yet another reason why you must be very careful about who you include in your advanced magical workings. Never allow grotto members to participate in rituals when they are obviously drunk or high. This has been the rule from the beginning of the Church of Satan, founded in San Francisco at the height of the acid-dropping 60's. It is simply too dangerous and can be disastrous for all present. The ritual chamber can be disorienting for a strong mind; it is too much for a drug-befuddled mind. It should go without saying that we don't encourage drug use as a part of any ritual, for the same reasons. When you perform outdoor rituals, make doubly certain all flames and embers from fires, torches, candles and braziers are well extinguished before you leave the area. The best way for a novice member to experience the concentration, breadth, rhythm and imagination necessary to be an advanced Satanic Magician is to write and perform his or her own ritual. What ritual should they perform, they will ask you? Where do they begin? Advise them to first look into their hearts to see what they feel passionate about, what metaphors, icons, names they'd feel most passionate about invoking. As Grotto Master, knowledgeable about magic and about the individual's obsessions, you can guide him to a ritual purpose that might capture his or her imagination. What purpose would he feel most compelled to accomplish? These are the things that will touch the Dark Ones. The key is your emotional link to the topic, how strongly you feel about it and how concrete and ever-present it is for you. That is our passageway to other realms - the fifth dimension and beyond. Besides emotions, use your uniqueness. Your voice will be heard and responded to more quickly if you are on a clear frequency, uncluttered by popular static. That's where your imagination shines forth. Tap into that which has been orphaned or lost; that which was once venerated, praised, worshipped, which has been long cast to dust and too-long neglected. Learn to spot shining bits of gold and jewels not quite covered by the sands of Time. It's up to us to reclaim these overlooked, worthy powers and reconnect with the force they once wielded. It's still there. Summon it, release it. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"As a Grotto Master, there is another important point you must always keep in mind. You were born a Satanist. There are a finite number of Satanists on the Earth. Standing before an altar dedicated to Satan, proudly invoking the demons of the Pit to come forth and enter you and assist you in manifesting your Will, accepting the mantle of \"Evil One\" and setting yourself apart from all society isn't everyone's cup of tea. Certain people may be drawn to the image of Satan or even obsessed with Satanism, but they may sabotage themselves with too many deepseated guilts and fears. Always remember - BLACK MAGIC IS DANGEROUS. If someone invokes the Dark Ones frivolously or fearfully, he is laying himself wide open for terrible psychic torture, physical torment, psychological damage and death by suicide or happenstance. There is good reason why diabolical rites are cloaked in secrecy and whispered of in hushed tones. They should be. Make no mistake. It is simply too potent for most people unless they come to Satanism of their own free Will. Do not push someone to experience more than be or she can handle. That's part of your job as Master - to evaluate what each individual in your group is ready to accept. Of course, if you are confronted with shit-disturbing assholes who are only interested in Satanism for cheap thrills, and it would amuse you – scare the Hell out of them. But make certain that they are deserving victims, or anything you conjure up will turn back on you. Satanic rituals and ceremonies should always be approached with an appropriate posture of respect and solemnity. We take our religion seriously. As familiar as you are with the others in your grotto, when you enter the ritual chamber, you become another being, crossing into another realm. You are reaching out into the black sethers, holding out your hand to your demon brothers. You must assume a self that would reflect that black fraternity, to allow them to use you as their bridge into this material world. They will breathe your breath, they will feel with your hands, see with your eyes. They are vampires; they feed off of you. Satan himself is a vampire who will reward you only as long as you feed him. That is your contract. It's a harsh reality, but one a true magician understands and revels in. Allow yourself a few moments before entering the chamber to achieve that state of active receptivity, to prepare yourself to be entered by the Dark Ones. Bring forth from within your own diabolical soul the magic and majesty that is due our Dark Lord. Ceremonies and rituals should be bold, well-orchestrated and purposeful. This is how we honor our Gods. By setting a stage they can feel honored to enter. Your \"chamber\" may only consist of a particular table upon which your ritual implements are set, with a Baphomet hanging above. You may not have room for a separate chamber per se; you may create only a temporary transformation for ritual purposes. The ritual chamber is a state of mind as much as a physical place. It is the consecrated area which you describe by ringing the bell nine times; it reaches out to the boundaries of where your comrades are standing. Do not insult the Dark Ones or inhibit them by placing an actual circle around you. You are inviting them to join you as Satanists. You need no protection from them. If you want to describe physical lines on the ground to focus your energies, 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"use the shape of the Trapezoid. Demons will be invited by those angles, repelled by any protective circle. You must train yourself to feel a release of emotions and psychic energy for your ritual to be successful. This release will come from the forehead (sometimes a tingling sensation in the area of the pineal gland), your heart chakra (about the middle of your chest) and from your groin. If the ritual or ceremony is strong enough you will feel a tingling in all three of these areas that will radiate throughout your body and sometimes make you feel light, as if you're floating. You may feel light-headed and dizzy. Time will become very elastic; you will leave the ritual chamber and be surprised at how much time, or how little time has passed - as when you've been deeply asleep, have dreamed complex, narrative dreams and then awakened to find you've only been asleep for 15 minutes. You will, most of all, feel vital and energized after a successful ritual, as if there is great static energy racing throughout your body (which there is). It's easy and healthy to translate these tinglings and rushings into sexual excitement and fulfillment. You should. Sex magic, in which both partners are using both their magical energy and sexual energy to focus on the same goals, can be exceedingly effective. We don't encourage orgies. This isn't because we're prudish; just that we've found from experience that it doesn't enhance sexual or magical satisfaction. For the Satanist, the thought of several naked people writhing about with no central focus, no individuation, no personal context, each aware of the rest and trying to outperform the next, is unappealing. This is not to imply that non-private sexual activity within a desired context (fantasy or actualized) is to be avoided. Use the energy the way it should be used, but the display and lack of concentration in an orgy situation doesn't enhance enjoyment or fulfillment. Any book on black magic, including this one, is only a primer. The complexities and glorious subtleties of Satanic magic will only be revealed to you through long years of application and experimentation. But, as with the full apprehension of an elegant mathematical formula or scientific principle, the endeavor is rich and satisfying, if you have the strength of mind and soul to appreciate it. To explore these realms and preserve what you learn, keep a magical grotto journal. Satanic tradition has called it a \"Black Book\", goetia (a book of ceremonial magic concerned with evoking demons and summoning souls of the dead), or grimoire (a word credited to A.E. Waite of the Golden Dawn). This is a magician's workbook, in which he records all the details of his rituals and acts of magic, and their results – music used, timing, who was present, what the ritual consisted of, what it was aimed toward, what names were evoked, what were the results and consequences. Don't record what was planned - record what happened, even if it wasn't planned. Record little details, no matter how insignificant they may seem at this time. Impressions, feelings, manifestations, coincidences, reactions after the rituals were over, any dreams you or your grotto participants may have had afterward. This is your scientific journal; you must enter details, speculations, and images meticulously so that others who may come after you may someday happen upon a vital bit of data from your journal that will allow the last 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"piece of the puzzle to fall into place, in our pilgrimage through space and time. Your ritual chamber is your laboratory. Your Black Book can be as simple as a spiral notebook or a large leatherbound blank book - whatever inspires you most. Keep your goetia locked away in a secure place. With it, over the long years of explorations - successes and failures - you carefully construct your corridor to the Netherworld. Your goetia will be with you throughout your magical journey. Some magicians order it burned when they die. Some include instructions in their will that it be sent to the Church of Satan upon their death, for safe keeping and utilization by those who know how to use it. Others assign their goetia to a worthy younger relative or apprentice when - the time is right. It should be regarded as a sacred, hidden volume, reflecting the power you achieve in your lifetime. Be warned that when you enter a ritual with a posture of arrogance, like a demanding, challenging child, your Master will not be pleased and will slap you down hard. Satan expects you to be respectful, not groveling; prideful, but not arrogant in front of him. He expects you to be useful to him, and he will support you as long as you amuse him. He richly rewards sincere dedication and steadfast loyalty. Do not fear that you can't pronounce the Enochian Keys right, or you didn't speak the invocation exactly as you had written it out ahead of time. He'll understand, as long as you feel the passionate dedication you claim, and you continue the ritual in a way that entertains him and compels him to stay in your presence. Certain ritual elements are absolutely necessary to set the stage that invites Satan and his minions to join you. But he will know the difference between a sincere dedication softly whispered and a pompous sham no matter how loudly declared. Remember well. Demons will enter you. If you are an unworthy Host, if you harbor secret fears or residual Christianity in any form, if you are frivolous in your intentions toward the Dark Side, they will scent it like a pack of wolves and bring you down mercilessly. Many a sorcerer or sorceress before you has fallen to ruin and destruction in this way, even after years of intimate contact with the Infernal Ones. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Section Seven Suggested Grotto Activities 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Your grotto will look to you for direction, and it will be up to you to guide them. Usually, you'll be able to conjure up some interesting activities based on the varied passions among you; When you can't think of anything, turn to this section for some broad suggestions you can modify as needed. Keep in mind that activities aren't necessary for their own sake but should be used as a tool to build familiarity, respect and trust within the grotto. It allows you all an informal way to get to know how each other works, to learn how you think, how quickly you react, to test each other. As with military maneuvers, you learn each others' strengths and weaknesses and learn to trust each other. This can be described as serving a twofold purpose: 1) To gain familiarity and trust with each other, and 2) To learn basic skills and share knowledge that might prove useful - business and communication skills, Lesser and Greater Magic, intuition and sensitivity, martial arts and use of weapons, flexibility of body and mind. The Satanic ideal is the same kind of balance Plato proposed: the interdependence of Mind-Body-Spirit. Maintain your Satanic standards; stay away from pop culture icons and expressions, play down anything too contemporary. Stick with the immortal, anachronistic, and unusual. Likewise don't encourage \"tract-home\", cheesy activities, dress or posture. The Satanic aesthetic dictates heavy and understated; bold lines and dominant mass. No need to wear your black robes and large Baphomets to the local Jack in the Box. Always maintain a sense of Satanic pride. We want to encourage informal activities that members can enjoy but we don't ever want to be rendered harmless. It's a fine line to maintain formality in outside encounters yet still be able to encourage frankness and consequent trust internally. If outsiders ask you what we do in our grottos, tell them we perform a lot of destruction rituals, have a lot of orgies and practice our sharpshooting. Allow them to preserve their illusions and Awe. A Satanist is a strange amalgam of intellect and soul, drama and reason - nurture both sides. We must train our wits and our souls. Satanists must be strong, swift, able to make good decisions quickly, know who to depend on under fire. We must be able to evoke and implement in spirit and in actuality. Your grotto members should have fun together but also know warriors skills. Even if you never use them, you will have the confidence those skills bring, and that will communicate itself to those around you. That's why we encourage our members to practice competence in martial arts, if they choose, and in the use of weapons. Practice whip-cracking; go to a gun range together and get some target practice. Every Satanist should know how to handle a whip and a gun. You're the leader. Your grotto will depend on you to get things started. As with teaching, you'll need a lesson plan for the evening. For your first second-level meeting, for example, you may want to have notes ready on topics to get discussions going. Focus on each participant. Ask them questions, draw them out. Break the ice by allowing everyone to tell a little about his or her interests and what he expects to gain out of working with the group. Keep conversation focused and directed, then step back and let it run if people get enthusiastic and the conversation seems to be going somewhere. Break into smaller 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"groups when it feels right and allow people to get to know each other a bit. Then you might want to conclude the evening with a quick communion ritual. Here are some random suggestions for grotto activities: 1) Take up instruments and start a musical combo. 2) Learn a language together. The best way to practice is to speak it with other people. 3) Role-play to work out problems with others outside or inside the group. There's a psychological technique of playing the role of the person you're having a conflict with called \"psychodrama\". Try it. 4) Perform scenes together-memorize and recite lines or a scene from a play, or recite poetry you've worked to memorize. It's excellent practice in concentration, retention, dramatic delivery, and it impresses people at parties. Hold weekly or monthly recitations where everyone has to memorize a piece and recite it. 5) Enact our Five Point Program: Build androids, create total environments, generate interest in getting something on a ballot regarding taxation of churches. 6) Conduct more formal classes on Satanism and black magical history within your grotto, devise quizzes and written exams on assigned readings. It might be a good way for you to see how well your members can comprehend and retain what they read. 7) Take field trips to local cemeteries or points of diabolical interest. 8) Conduct learning seminars, or invite guest lecturers or hold workshops on topics that interest your members. Follow your members' obsessions – allow them to educate you on their specialized skills and interests. Or find out about something you've always been curious about. 9) Hold literary discussion groups in which you all read the same books and discuss them. Conduct poetry/work readings during which members can share their works in progress, and get criticism and suggestions from the group. 10) Brainstorm activities to make money for group expeditions- not just creating newsletters, but selling jewelry, organizing an art exhibit, staging a show or a play. 11) Sponsor a Satanic Fair – imagine a Renaissance Faire - type event dedicated to Satanism. There could be costumes of all types and eras; temporary total environments; wares, foods, jewelry, artwork, books and clothing for sale; soapbox rantings; poetry readings; computer and electronic toy exhibits; live music; martial arts and fencing exhibitions...Such events are inevitable - why not be the first to organize one? 12) Play parlor games- Charades, 20 Questions, Authors, card games, backgammon, chess, bridge. Put on some records and dance. 13) Steve Allen used to conduct a television show in which actors would come together as different characters from history. He called it \"Steve Allen's Roundtable\", and the historical figures were usually from different eras, but had enough in common to create lively debate and discussion, had they ever been able to meet. The actors had to research the characters, come on in costume and speak as the historical figures might have spoken. So you could have Albert Einstein, Galileo, and Torquemada all in the same room. This may be too difficult and cerebral for most grottos, but an excellent magical exercise in evocation and staying in character if you want to try it. 14) Send out formal invitations to a black-tie-only affair. Prepare a sumptuous dinner, have your members dress in black tails and formal dress and treat your guests to a 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"candlelit evening of fine food and politely witty conversation. Men can retire to the parlor afterward for brandy and cigars, joined later by the ladies for recitations and light musical airs. 15) Go to a location far from city - light pollution and star-gaze or meteor-watch. You may want to combine this with a camping trip or expedition to a hidden bed and breakfast inn one of you has discovered. 16) Charter a boat-go on a moonlight cruise or whale watching trip together. 17) Visit local caves. 18) Go to the opera, symphony, ballet or other theatrical or musical performances together, dressed formally. Enjoy the drama you present to the other theatre-goers. 19) Go diving together. 20) If some of your membershave kids, go to Disneyland or Disney World together, or indulge in similar amusements. (The Church of Satan may eventually want to develop a system of family-oriented grottos as a subset of our other grotto activities. There are many obvious advantages to groups devoted to Satanic families. You can practice homeschooling/group schooling together, sharing learning resources; you can share caretaking with trusted, aligned parents; you can develop family-oriented rituals and outings, and go on camping and child-centered expeditions together. Any further developments along these lines will be dictated by how much positive response Central Grotto gets concerning such a need.) 21) If you feel drawn to it and you think it would behoove you, volunteer with a local animal shelter, conservation or pollution clean-up group. 22) Organize a scavenger hunt. 23) Produce a video for a local public access cable station. 24) Organize a film festival, either for your active participants or open to the public, followed by discussion of similar Satanic elements in apparently disparate films. 25) Hold an annual GYST (Get Your Shit Together) retreat, perhaps over Walpurgisnacht. Take a trip into the mountains or to the ocean, review your activities and rituals over the past year and make plans for the future. Set time aside for an inspiring ritual or two, relaxation, rejuvenation and fun. 26) Start a business, explore a sport, reinforce goals and New Year's resolutions that encourage peak health, material gain and positive outlook; invest in our future by strengthening our minds, bodies and spirits. 27) Explore speech tournament and Toastmaster techniques. Hold formal debates, present prepared speeches and expository speeches....This trains you to think fast on your feet, formulate ideas quickly, answer questions effectively in your roles as Satanic representatives. 28) Follow in the footsteps of Dr. LaVey and the original Magic Circle – hold periodic soirees and masques four times a year, or whenever you feel so inclined. For a time before the actual Church of Satan was founded, Dr. LaVey hosted costumed get-togethers every year at Walpurgisnacht, Halloween, Midsummer's Eve, and New Year's. 29) Stage a seance, complete with sound effects, aromas (gardenias, roses or something someone in your audience has mentioned previously), table tilting, spirit rappers, ectoplasm and cold breezes. Advertise the audience participation performance to raise money for other field trips and activities. Make sure your select audience is told it's 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"staged - they'll still walk away convinced that they experienced mystical contact. Such is the strength of the delightful human imagination. 30) Build gadgets and psychotronic devices; have regular practice sessions in parapsychological training. Set the mood appropriately. It will help train your psychic sensitivity, perception of non-verbal cues, and concentration to aid you in ritual magic. Experiment with chakra balancing, massage and various sensitization methods, guided meditations, guided OOBEs. This is the Devil's realm. Drag out the Ouija board, tarot cards, crystal ball and Zener cards. Play psychic games. Experiment and believe like you did when you were thirteen years old and just beginning on the Left-Hand Path. Don't be shy or think you're being silly. No telling what parapsychological feats a group of truly attuned Satanists could achieve. These are just broad suggestions; you'll find a few more in the following section. Always keep a wider purpose in mind; our activities must never take place in a vacuum, but must build greater influence and power in the outside world, both individually and as a Satanic movement. To do this, we'll need to focus all our material and magical resources. Your grotto should be able to switch quickly between a mundane posture and a ritual posture. Within the blink of an eye, with a word from you, they should be ready to receive the Demonic. This can be achieved through training, concentration and quick wits. Encourage this in your grotto by throwing them a curve once in awhile. Don't be too predictable. Allow them to be assured you'll lead them capably. They need to be able to shift into a deeper level of concentration when you demand it. Your lives may depend on it someday. As trust among members of the stable core grotto increases, activities may become more adventurous at the discretion of the Grotto Master and with the consent of all adults involved. Be spontaneous - follow your intuition. If you feel enlivened or frustrated or bored on a particular night, the way the moon is shining, something you can't get out of your mind, that keeps tugging at you, haunting you – call your pack together and howl at the moon. Tell them to drop their plans and meet you under the stars. If your magic is progressing and your group has established resonance with each other, they're probably feeling the same way you are. As their Master, provide mysteries and challenges. See where your spontaneity leads you. 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Section Eight Diabolical Theatre 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"According to the Bard, \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players...\" We would do well to heed these words. Dr. LaVey has been accused of being too theatrical or dramatic in his presentation of our religion. But it is exactly the theatre of Satanism that should be fostered, as in the original Magic Circle days. The great strength of Satan is not only in His advocacy of rationality and science, but in the imagination, the theatrics, the pomp and true magic that can be evoked by and beyond that. Since grotto opportunities have been discouraged, that aspect of Satanism has been downplayed and atrophied. Social changes and shifting spirits dictate that it's time to revive it. The Devil is always a showman - whether it's in the guise of the omniscient Stage Manager, or a stage magician, a carny huckster, or Puck - He is the Master behind the scenes, pulling the strings, steering the audience and the other characters in the play toward their destiny. There is sinister purpose in studying the methods and trappings of the theatre and applying them to a successful life. By doing this, you create a play for yourself, and cast yourself in the starring role, our anti-hero. You create a fabric of the Is To Be, writing your fiction as you live it. Thinking of yourself as an actor in the world, and of your fellow Satanists as your dramatic comrades, makes you aware that there's always a difference between the performers in life and the audience, between what goes on on-stage and what goes on backstage. The audience doesn't know the mad scurrying and last-minute scenery touch-ups that take place just before the curtain goes up. They don't want to know; the audience only wants to be entertained. The actors remain poised and in character – the show always goes on. To be able to switch instantaneously between the mundane and the magical, takes the kind of applied schizophrenia for which actors train all their lives. In a magician, this translates to being able to enter a \"theatrical\" mode whenever it's required. The solemnity of your Intellectual Decompression Chamber should always be accessible, even during the most informal group activities. You should be able to switch immediately at a single word, as a group, from one mode to another. Theatrical training is perfect for that. You work with others on a stage to pick up cues, cover for flubbed lines of dialogue or movement, stay in character, and maintain the illusion. You learn how to ad lib and keep smiling, and how to work in non-verbal communication with your fellow actors. The audience will never know you've missed your line if you or the others don't telegraph it. It trains you to act as a troupe, supportive of each other, not trying to upstage or undermine each other. An actor also trains himself to observe people very closely, knowing he may be called upon at any time to play someone very old, or very young or quite different from himself. He has to have a repertoire of details from which to draw, to evoke the feelings his character requires. This encourages a magician's powers of observation, attention to detail, evocation of mystery, and the projection of character. The theatre also conditions you to the importance of timing. Timing and phrasing is often what distinguishes a fine actor or comedian from a mediocre one. You learn to give 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"portent and fresh meaning to lines you may have recited a thousand times, by phrasing and pausing to communicate the emotions and subtext of the play. Think of these kinds of details when you perform ritual magic. Rehearse rituals as you would rehearse a play; memorize your lines until you can recite them without thinking about it. Then, when you are performing the actual ritual, you can concentrate on the emotions and transcendence rather than the rubrics and movements themselves. Don't fear that repetition will defuse the potency of the ritual if you rehearse it again and again until you have it letter-perfect. It will intensify the power once the words and actions become second-nature and seep into your unconscious. With such intensive practice, you'll find yourself integrating the rituals into your dreams and will eventually find yourself experiencing the same out-of-body separation some actors describe when they \"watch\" themselves give a flawless performance. The greatest nations have been cemented by theatrical pomp and stirring music. We cannot have a lasting movement which doesn't excite the imagination. Learn the tools of illusion. Join a local theatre group. Even a small community theatre will give you training in techniques in staging, lighting, makeup, costuming, directing, dramatic writing and acting that will improve both your ritual and everyday magic. Within your grotto, perform scenes, explore spontaneous theatre, practice accents, experiment with subtle modifications of facial features with makeup techniques, fabricate dramatic costumes. Learn and use every special effect in your arsenal. For us, there is no distinction between \"magick\" and \"magic\"; stage magic becomes \"real\" magic, if you dress the stage properly. Your success depends on creating an engaging performance for a most discriminating Diabolical patron. 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Section Nine Security 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"As stated in a previous chapter, if you request a position as a Grotto Master, you are offering to lead an essentially open forum. Most security procedures are included in Section One but there are a few things that require additional attention. We require you get a post office box and screen participants thoroughly. We'll try not to point creeps and thrill-seekers in your direction, but people aren't necessarily truthful on their applications. Even at that, you'll eventually attract people through word of mouth and local advertising that haven't gone through our admissions process. Once again, don't hold initial public oriented meetings in your home or in another group member's home. Banquet rooms can be arranged for at local restaurants, conference rooms are generally available for rent at local hotels, ask about any conference or meeting rooms available at service organizations, non-Christian community centers, university and college campuses, libraries. Local occult shops generally encourage guest lectures and workshops from people in the local occult community...not Satanists, of course. Surprise them with your confidence, openness and wit (and your Smith and Wesson). Be honest about who you are and that you plan to have an open meeting about Satanism. Present yourself well, dress conservatively and have a confident, measured delivery. They can turn you down or accept you knowing what to expect. Through your screening process you'll be able to deny grotto admission to thrill seekers, disruptive elements, Christian or other \"infiltrators\" who want to play spy, or those under your state's legal age of consent (usually 18). There are many 13 and 14 year-old Satanists who are very intelligent and capable, but for your protection and ours it isn't wise to involve underage young people in activities. It's okay to involve members' children in family-oriented activities - but only with their parents' written consent and participation. An application for active grotto participation is included in Appendix E. The answers to these questions should give you an indication of how valuable the prospective member may be to your group. During the actual screening interview, keep an eye out for non- verbal communication as well. Does the individual appear nervous, evasive, is she comfortable looking you in the eye, is he shifting around in his seat, crossing and uncrossing his arms and legs? Or does he or she give the impression of being relaxed, interested, supportive and enthusiastic? How many questions does he have? Are they valid questions or do they indicate the individual wants to know everything too quickly? Does it sound like he's just fishing for information? For your part, always remember that first impressions are lasting ones. Meet the potential active member in a neutral area, and bring your second-in-command or mate with you. Be reserved, pointed, and commanding. Even if you are enthused about the person's potential - especially if you're enthused - set a tone of authority from the very beginning. The time for informality and frivolity will come later. No need to be dour and humorless, just set a subdued, portentous tone. If the individual is a committed Satanist looking for legitimate activities, your posture of confidence and drama will assure him or her that you are indeed a qualified representative of the Church of Satan. The prospective participant may ask you to produce your Church of Satan membership card, and certificate authorizing you as a Grotto Master, which is a sensible request. It's up to you 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"and your Second to answer whatever questions seem reasonable, but to put most of the burden on the interviewee to answer your questions. Request that you keep his membership card long enough to photocopy it and send the copy to Central Grotto, along with a copy of the completed application and your evaluation. Be sure to name any individuals you're considering for active involvement in your monthly grotto report before you actually include them in your second-level activities. If there are any red flags that go up about this person -if he or she is known to be bad news – then we'll have time to warn you. If you decline to include the applicant in further involvement at this time, simply inform him by mail that it's not time for him or her to be involved further right now, either for administrative or magical reasons, that he can feel free to attend open meetings as he has, and to be considered for other involvement again later if he chooses. Concerning internal security, we are organized in what is essentially a cell system, with each grotto acting with equal authority as an arm of the Church of Satan. You don't know where all the grottos are, who the members, Priests and Magisters are. Don't bird-dog other grottos or administrators. You aren't supposed to know. In that sense we are a secret society. That's why Dr. LaVey has discouraged national or international get-togethers for so long. It makes us vulnerable to physical attack, it cheapens our image and it makes it too easy for someone to hang around taking pictures and recording names. Having long lists of all our members available for public viewing is not only impractical but dangerous. We will never publish or sell our mailing lists, grotto lists or priesthood rosters. Many grottos and individuals choose to remain covert and we will always respect that. A cell system, in which each person only knows a few other people, is ultimately more productive and safer for all of us. If you are known to be a Satanist, there will be supporters, known and unknown to you, who will come to your aid because you are known to be a Satanist – as Dr. LaVey has said, \"...putting the paper in the yes basket or the no basket.\" That is what counts. You should know that members of the Church of Satan are considered members for life. They are free to resign their membership in the Church of Satan at any time, simply by submitting that request in writing to Central Grotto. Members are only expelled from the Church of Satan for the most extreme offenses. Other members are expected to disassociate themselves from these individuals quickly, if they want to remain in good graces with the Church of Satan. Those who have been churlish or destructive enough to have actually been expelled should not be allowed to continue to feed off the organization they've betrayed. They should thereafter be considered banished. Your first allegiance, and your grotto members' first allegiance, must always be to the Church of Satan. The grotto system is doomed to disintegrate if sabotaged from within. Our success will requires eternal vigilance. Beware of little people with big ideas. Stoolies, child molesters and looters have always been killed in civilized societies. Leadership usually requires keeping secrets. Some information - such as this handbook, certain conversations you may have with others in the course of your duties, directives from the High Priest - is intended for your eyes only, unless you are specifically directed that the information is intended for wider distribution. Also, keep your members' names, addresses, phone numbers and personal information sacrosanct. It's not required to be 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"\"out\" to be a potent member of Church of Satan. It's considered an extreme breech of protocol and grounds for suspension of Grotto Master status to purposefully expose someone who wishes his or her affiliation to remain covert. We have always kept membership rosters secured. We expect you to respect your grotto members' privacy in the same way. Don't bird-dog influential members, don't stake them out or pester them. They are our strength. As Grotto Master, you are in a greater position of trust with the Church of Satan and our members - DON'T BETRAY THAT TRUST. As you can see, the position of Grotto Master requires time, commitment and fortitude. The path of initiation into Satanic magic is, of necessity, a solitary one. Only the Dark Soul within can guide an individual to power. We each have our own methods and pace. Don't think Central Grotto will think you're not \"doing your job\" if you don't multiply the flock. Again, to achieve our goals we must all apply the first principle of our Pentagonal Revisionism. You are free to resign your duties at any time and your status within the organization will not suffer. Your Grotto Master status will be fully activated when you sign and return a photocopy of the waiver included in Appendix E, indicating you've read and understood the contents of this handbook. Best wishes for indulgence and fulfillment along your chosen Sinister Path. We are the real thing. As Dr. LaVey has said, \"Others imitate. We innovate.\" And we will remain the real thing as long as our members – especially those within our hierarchy - remain steadfastly connected to our Diabolic Vision. The strong, the resolute and the imaginative will thrive; the weak, the insecure and the unimaginative will wither and be cast aside. Invite Satan to possess you and guide you to success. Ultimately, your new role is a rite of passage, a Flame that will challenge and purify you. Do not be disheartened if your grotto members don't form the ideal cohesion encouraged in this book, or don't seem as committed as you are. You have your own Pact to satisfy; this is your destiny. But others may not breathe the sulphur of our Dark Lord as deeply as you do. Rejoice and be strengthened upon discovering your unique qualities. Learn where to apply them for your most efficient benefit. Use what you will learn from coming experiences as a springboard to greater dedication to Satan and ever greater success. \"I am a Satanist! Bow down, for I am the highest embodiment of human life!\" 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A Sycophants, Unite! by Blanche Barton I hate to write this article. I hate to have to address these issues because they make me angry and I hate to be angry. And I especially hate to be angry when I have been purposely baited into being angry-forced to waste my precious adrenal output, drained of my psychic/creative force, and maneuvered into writing an article like this. But there is something going on right now in the Satanic community that must be addressed, a phenomenon that must be cut out like the vile cancer that it is. Our supporters and advocates must be prepared to recognize and battle our enemies, especially when they're wearing black robes. Bear with me and let's get this down on paper, out into the ethers and ritualized out of our systems so we can move on to real issues confronting us. In our general information packet we have a \"Satanic Bunco Sheet\". You've all read it, but let me highlight a couple of pertinent points. Tip Number Four states: The most parasitic 'Satanic' newsletters invariably contain a liberal dose of LaVey- baiting. Their editors 'masochistic requirements are exercised as lively exchange'. Their mainstay is often the reprinting of any letter, pro or con, from anyone capable of grasping a writing implement or poking at a computer or typewriter key. When responding to such transparent tactics, it's our policy to preface rebuttals with two acknowledgements: A) 'I know you're a masochist and delight in hostile banter,' and B) 'Anything I write or say to you will keep you going for another six months.' The Satanic Bible advises to 'question all things'- but it helps to be able to think, first.\" Further in the flyer, inquirers are warned: \"All of the above are subject to bitch-fights, petty jealousies, and rivalries. They are safe havens for small-minded people trying to play head games, preferring the protection of groups rather than really working to apply what Anton LaVey wrote.\" There is a creeping pestilence of divisiveness weaving its way into our ranks that we must ruthlessly halt before it strangles us all. This divisiveness and contentiousness isn't perhaps apparent to the untrained eye, hence the need for this article. It takes the form of \"honest inquiry\", \"challenging debate\", and \"stimulating dialogue\". It takes LaVey's dictum of \"question all things\", and uses it to justify stirring up useless and counterproductive intellectual turbulence, all for the good of the philosophy. Anyone who refuses to be drawn into these stimulating debates, or who has a kind or supportive word to say about his philosophy's founder, Anton LaVey, is quickly labeled a \"sycophant\", a \"LaVey fanatic\", and \"overly-adulatory\". One is, thereby, incapable of objective, 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"independent thought and can be relegated to the role of empty-headed, brainwashed moron. There aren't many of these instigators of \"lively exchange\" yet, but one or two have wormed their way into the good graces of the Satanic network, leeching off of our growing above-ground system of newsletters and correspondents, yet snidely refusing to align themselves with our progenitor organization. Now that Satanism is becoming an alternative, the \"lot lice\" are sniffing around at ways to sneak in under the tent flap without putting themselves on the line. We must recognize their insidious techniques before they undermine us irreparably. They pride themselves on being \"unaffiliated\", implying that \"affiliated\" forums, like The Black Flame, are so contaminated with admiration for Anton LaVey that they might slant or censor serious debate such as the sort they encourage. Of course, they don't send courtesy copies of their insightful newsletters to the Church of Satan, as most Satanically-oriented editors do, or someone might recognize them for the vile Quislings that they are. Many brashly depend on exposure in The Black Flame to generate a mailing list, won't commit themselves as Church of Satan members, but challenge our policies in the innocent guise of stimulating debate. Recent articles in one or two of these newsletters have advocated rape, bestiality, and incest as viable Satanic alternatives, as well as providing a forum for hashing out such burning Satanic issues as pedophilia and fascism. In doing this, they create conflicts where none need exist, just for the sake of rhetorical gymnastics. I figured out such actions are wrong when I was a little kid; things like rape, pedophilia and bestiality are unacceptable in civilized society because they are harmful, disruptive, unjust and they hurt innocent creatures. End of discussion. Is that so hard to figure out? Don't we all know this already? Of course we do. We're being baited and goaded into debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. As for the danger of fascism infiltrating the Satanic movement, what are we supposed to be? A bunch of kindergarten babies? Are we supposed to be such self-righteous prigs that we can't stand to see a swastika? By accusing us of fascism, are we supposed to be distracted from the fact that we live in an extremely puritanical, fascistic society? From all reports, Church of Satan members have never been intimidated by swastikas, or any other emotionally - charged symbol. Those who have worn both attest to the greater power of the Baphomet to scare and mystify viewers. We don't need school marms to hover over us with rulers to slap our little hands and say \"naughty, naughty.\" It seems preposterous to me that such desktop critics think fascism can harm the movement, whereas their advocating rape and incest can do us no end of good. One popular posture is that of the \"intellectual\" Satanic alternative. It's an elementary debating technique used to create a false dichotomy - claiming your opponent is something he isn't (i.e. fascist, racist, chauvinistic, non-intellectuals), thereby showing yourself to be pure by contrast, and forcing your opponent into a defensive position. If an \"alternative\" Satanist boldly declares himself to be against animal sacrifices, Satanists 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"who have read The Satanic Bible are forced to debate this non-issue. Upon examination, the \"intellectual\" alternative might be draped in perplexing, spiritualistic language but it still advocates the same Satanism you read in The Satanic Bible: indulgence, individualism, challenging the status quo, reward based on merit rather than race, and intelligence. Gee, how different that is from that LaVeyan nonsense. I am deeply offended by irresponsible, obfuscating mental masturbation. If this were the kind of thing going on in the Church of Satan in 1976, I never would've joined. It's distasteful and juvenile - like a toddler who's just discovered he has a wee-wee and wants to play with it all the time. It doesn't reflect a finely-honed mind as some might think; on the contrary, it indicates someone who is intellectually insecure - the equivalent of the schoolyard bully who has to pick on other kids to show how tough he is, an intellectual bully who intimidates and goads those who might be a bit insecure themselves. I enjoy the odd game of mental fencing as much as the next Satanist, but this line of \"exciting open discussions\" are an offensive misapplication of logic and rhetoric which should be recognized for what they are: shit-disturbing. Playing the Socratic gadfly, stinging us all into clarifying these issues before our detractors use them against us, is supposed to create turbulence for our own good. Thanks but no thanks. Worse than simply a waste of time and brainpower, this kind of insidious undermining creates a ripple-effect of problems we all have to eventually clean up. Here's a hypothetical progression: 1) Mr. Q starts Darkness Visible, yet another Satanic newsletter. He's not a member of the Church of Satan, but he advertises in all the respected, openly-affiliating newsletters. He is seldom overtly critical of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey or The Black Flame so loyal compatriots think he must be all right. 2) Mr. Q publishes adherents' articles, and compliments others on their various projects. People see their name in print, bask in his praise, and figure he must be an exceedingly perceptive fellow. 3) Mr. Q pays for ads for Darkness Visible, not solely by subscription exchange, but by that time-honored inducement called \"money\". To an enterprising editor/publisher of a fledgling Satanic newsletter with extremely limited funding, a paid advertisement can be a welcome insert, no matter how insulting its wording. 4) After a few issues, Mr. Q appoints himself supreme arbiter of Satanic philosophy, providing a forum for \"forms of Satanism\" which might not meet the approval of the Church of Satan. What does Anton LaVey know anyway? He only created the philosophy. Why should his organization have any final word in defining the religion? 5) People who might be moderately interested in Satanism pick up a copy of Darkness Visible, see advocacy of bestiality, and drop the whole idea as something they'd want nothing to do with. 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"6) Satanophobic groups get a hold of a copy of Darkness Visible advocating bestiality, ape and incest and use it to confirm all of the Christian hysteria we've had to fight so hard to dispel. We get to clean up the shit, we get flack at work, we get our children jeopardized and our cars egged, not Mr. unaffiliated, ethical-inquiry, what-who-me?. 7) Our most supportive, productive, stalwart members get tired of being called \"sycophants\", tired of being drawn into pointless interchanges, get tired of defending and justifying themselves and their chosen leader, and quietly move on to less complicated, more productive advocacies. 8) Members of our hierarchy begin to debate about how best to handle these psychic vampires - whether it's better to make people aware, publish a shit list of people to freeze out of the network, or whether it's better to shine a glaring light on them, allow them all the forum they can handle, thereby showing themselves for the slime that they are. We are therefore divided. How could an infiltrating Christian agent provocateur bent on destroying the Satanic movement undermine it more efficiently? The only reason I've gone into some detail concerning these methods is so that you'll be equipped to recognize such divisive maneuverings when you see them. So far, we've all done a pretty good job of weeding out this sort of contentiousness. But now, since the Satanic movement is gaining more steam than ever, we need to tighten our ranks. There is no room in the Church of Satan for hair-splitters and nitpickers. If you have a policy question, you can call or write to the Church of Satan and ask what the Church's stand on pedophilia or bestiality is (if you haven't read The Satanic Bible yet); we don't need BBS bickerings or pointless newsletter interchanges \"to hammer these issues out\". Go to the source and ask what Satanic policy is. Because Anton LaVey wanted his philosophy to be accessible to those without stultified minds, anyone can go into a bookstore, pick up a copy of The Satanic Bible, read, understand, and apply Satanism to better her life. As for group activities, newsletters and the like, the Church of Satan has maintained a laissez-faire policy over the past three decades. Official membership isn't demanded, just simple acknowledgement of the source and accurate codification of LaVeyan principles. This in itself is Satanic, placing the responsibility for your own \"salvation\" and entertainment squarely on your own shoulders where it belongs instead of on a \"Priest\" who'll talk to God for you or reveal the Great Mysteries - for a price. There will always be jealous, unethical, subversive, self-loathing, counterproductive, life- sucking parasites who will want to scavenge from our viable organization. They are shallow, without vision, and probably incapable of commitment or loyalty to anything or anyone. They will continue to use whatever ploys they can to obfuscate, disable and defuse us. Don't be swayed, flattered or ghettoized. The Satanic network is not the real world; our power lies in having an effect in the real world - Satan's true realm. Dare to be a big fish in a bigger pond – you have the power to do so. You're a Satanist, and can proudly declare, \"I have taken thy name as a part of myself...\" 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Church of Satan was formed as a mutual admiration society, not as an encounter group. We are energized by and supportive of each other. Of course there are going to be differences among us. Satan is representative of the reconciliation of apparent irreconcilables. We're driven individualists with our own obsessions and directions. One of our greatest strengths is that we can't be neatly pigeonholed and dismissed. Anton LaVey intended his organization to be a meeting of minds, where a highly-evolved black man could stand forth in front of a Baphomet and curse his \"brothers\" for forcing him down to their level, and a white man could stand beside him and curse his self-hating race who has undermined itself to the brink of extinction by perpetuating the lie of Christianity for 2000 years. We can choose to concentrate on our differences, worry them and pick at them like scabs until they pus and infect, or we can concentrate on our similarities, our mutual goals, and our relief to be among others of like mind where, as Milton wrote, \"Here at least we shall be free.. though in Hell.\" Because Anton LaVey has maintained the standard of \"what you are inside is dictated by what you are outside,\" we have become more of a professional cabal than just another occultic circle-jerk. Like the Masons, we pass secret signs or mention certain names that open doors. When one says he's an affiliate of the Church of Satan to the right people, assumptions are made that he's a product-oriented, no-bullshit kind of person who'll get things done. To protect that status, we cannot allow those who will dilute our growing reputation to ride on our coattails, wheedling their way into others' good graces at our expense. We are the only cohesive international movement on the horizon today. We have one book, one man, one organization to stand behind. That's more than the Wiccans can accomplish, or the Republicans, or the Democrats, or the Christians. We are invincible as an organization, as a movement - but not as feuding, factionalized splinter groups. For that kind of cohesion, we need a leader. There have been countless psychological studies focusing on group dynamics. One person always emerges as the leader, otherwise nothing gets done. Someone doesn't set himself up as leader by posturing and preening; leaders are appointed by those in whom they engender loyalty, admiration, trust, and confidence. Only those who are secure in their own egos can unreservedly commit their allegiance to a man they respect. It's an unpopular stance these days; read the newspaper. We're lucky to have a leader like Anton LaVey. He has ensured that his philosophy will not die with him; it has been and will continue to be codified, expanded and applied in new areas by his organization. The Church of Satan cannot be defined as a personality cult. We are not dependent on the personality of Anton LaVey; the philosophy he established and still codifies will survive the centuries. But we do respect him and acknowledge him with unswerving loyalty-not blind faith, but educated admiration. In these days of electing our sacrifices and tabloid crucifixions, it's blasphemous to respect a leader and not try to tear him down - almost as heretical as calling forth Lord Satan Himself. That kind of loyalty comes naturally to a true Satanist; it rankles those with a lingering Christian agenda. 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Our most productive people are \"LaVey fanatics\", those who say, \"Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. I'll throw in my lot with the ones who started it, who sustain it, and I'll do my part by applying Satanism in my own life toward product and satisfaction.\" Sycophants are the ones who make it worthwhile for Dr. LaVey to continue writing, to keep recording his music. They encourage further productivity and let him know his perseverance isn't in vain. Anton LaVey doesn't need to justify or defend himself to anyone; his strength and his talent justify him. He is a noble, creative man who remains steadfast in his convictions. That's what his detractors can't stand. His words and his music only ring truer because of their efforts to defuse him. Sycophantic praise is more valuable to him than people who want to start their groups or their newsletters, \"all for the good of the Church.\" Start them, fine. But admit unabashedly it's to feed your ego and your pocket, not Dr. LaVey's. Apply your enthusiasm toward larger practical goals. Put taxation of churches on a ballot, invest your mind and money in the development of Artificial Human Companions, virtual reality, and total environments...do something. You are aligned with powerful forces- utilize them. We are responsible for the Renaissance, the revolution, if there is to be any at all. We are the leaders, not the gossips, critics and commentators. As we accelerate along this electronic superhighway, there are fewer artisans, more kibbitzers and packagers feeding off the rare tidbit of creativity. Product has become more precious than gold. Don't get bogged down in networking and he-said/she-said accusations, spending too much time playing the game we lose sight of the objective. Examine motives, not smokescreen \"issues.\" So the next time someone accuses you of being a \"sycophant,\" smile portentously, give a slight nod and know you've identified an enemy. Our detractors want to undermine your confidence, your principles, and our cohesion by throwing such words around. We have direction and focus. We cannot afford to have our energy siphoned off and sabotaged from within. We're out for bigger game. Don't fall for the cheap ploys of the jealous and weak. Don't submit. JUST SAY NO: You're a scumbag, I don't like you, get away from me, you stink, I don't want to hear what you have to say, I'm not interested, you are not welcome here, go find another sucker. At this juncture, we cannot tolerate dissension, dialoguing, skeptical inquiry or inciting to mutiny. The stakes are too high. If this is to be called tyrannical, despotic and ruthless, so be it. Internal strife is our only significant enemy. Now you can recognize these agitators' sleight of hand, and their motives. We know who we are and they know who they are. Yes, it is an us-vs.-them world; even when they try to call themselves Satanists. And don't expect me to be drawn into further angry response when this article is dissected by \"honest inquirers\". My ritual is complete. I have more important things to do and so do you. 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"APPENDIX B Some Thoughts on Satanic Rituals What follows is a grotto Initiation Ritual, based on the original initiation rites used by the Church of Satan. All of our rituals are based on principles, scenes, and phrases that have been passed down through various Satanic lines for centuries. Most general guidelines for Satanic rituals can be found in Dr. LaVey's Satanic Bible and Satanic Rituals. There are a few practical concerns to also keep in mind: Rituals traditionally begin at midnight unless otherwise indicated. It's not necessary for the Celebrant (usually you) to memorize all of his lines, though that wouldn't be an impossible task for a competent actor. If you choose not to memorize your recitations, it's perfectly acceptable for an Acolyte to hold the book open for you to read. You might need another Acolyte to hold a candle aloft so you can see clearly. The Initiation Ritual that follows is printed large enough to see in the murky light of the ritual chamber. All participants should wear black shoes, men should wear black socks, take off wristwatches and put them in your pocket or purse. Aesthetics is everything. The ritual chamber should be a place set apart from time and contemporary reminders. If the Initiate wishes to adopt a magical name, this can be included in the ritual at a point you deem appropriate. \"Baphomet\" is pronounced \"Baf-o-met\", not \"Baf-o-may\". Children traditionally are free to attend appropriate ceremonies, with their parents' permission. Toddlers have a profound, native sense of ritual, showing how basic it is to human emotional needs. Little children develop rituals on their own-juice from a particular cup, bedtime rituals, certain repeated incantations or habits they insist on fulfilling-in order to maintain a sense of security, continuity, cohesion and control over their lives. Adults require rituals for the same reasons. It's up to parents to decide if they feel comfortable including their children. Some Satanists feel they want to isolate their children from the ritual aspects of any religion before the children reach an age when they can request to attend, thereby avoiding forced indoctrination. Other Satanists feel they want to include their children so they can learn to appreciate the nobility and majesty of our religion from an early age, establishing it as a \"baseline\" by which to measure other religions when the time comes for them to compare them. Ceremonies bind families together, as well as assuring the child that he has a place in a wider community of Satanists-people who share values, mythical references, role models, history and direction with his own family. The key is to encourage intellectual and spiritual exploration, not forcing our religion onto our children to the point where they feel oppressed by it and need to rebel against it. Don't neglect our High Priest's Satanic Rituals. This is our Necronomicon of Satanic history. There are some powerful rituals included in that book and they are our heritage. Remember, too, that we are non-initiatory. Your second-level members aren't required to go through the Initiation Ritual unless they want to. Catholicism, Mormonism, the Baptist religion, and most other mystical sects require their adherents to pass through some baptism or similar ceremony in order to fully align themselves with that faith. We don't depend on \"secret teachings\" or being \"saved\" in order to bolster a nonsensical religion. 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"This is another reason why we can't tell how many people are Satanists at this point - their religions count heads by tracking their baptism records. We don't have any such ritual that divides a \"full-fledged\" Satanist from one who is living the Satanic philosophy. Everything one needs to how to be a successful Satanist is in The Satanic Bible, available in every major bookstore. Rituals are an adjunct to that, an indulgence rather than a necessity. Remember that this is a suggested Initiation Ritual. We encourage members to construct their own rites. But the rituals Dr. LaVey has devised are based on Satanic traditions and have proven to be very effective. 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Initiation Ritual for Church of Satan Grotto Participants Preparation for the Celebrant, before ritual: During the ritual, the Initiate should be given a Word upon which he can concentrate his energies, something the Celebrant (Grotto Master or Priest) feels will inspire or help the Initiate fulfill the next phase of his magical path. The Celebrant should meditate on this Initiate ahead of time, to prepare himself to initiate the individual. Take a piece of his/her clothing or jewelry a few days before the ritual, to hold and psychometrize in private meditation in order to bring forth a focus word for the Initiate, to connect with the Initiate so that you will be qualified to usher him into this next stage of his magical transformation. The ritual consists of three parts reflecting the awakening of Mind, Spirit and Flesh: The test of the Initiate's mind, the purification of his spirit, then the presentation of the first tools the Neophyte will need to manifest his will on the physical plane. Use your intuition to time the Initiation so that it will plant seeds of magic. What strengths can you conjure for him, what cautions does he need at this stage of his development, what must he do more of, or less of? Find a word of direction and write it on a small slip of paper, to give him during the Initiation Ritual. Assign various members of your group one of the Nine Satanic Statements. Let them know they'll be expected to recite it during the ceremony (if you have fewer than nine other people in your group, assign two or three Statements to each participant). One of the Initiate's friends among the group will speak as his Sponsor during the ceremony. Also choose two members to act as Acolytes for the evening. Explain their tasks to them as they are described below. Most rituals must be carefully rehearsed with all participants to insure the ritual proceeds smoothly. This can not be the case with the Initiation Ritual, in which the main participant-the Initiate should not know fully what is going to happen to him before he actually participates in his Initiation. This builds up magical anticipation in him and makes his experience of the ritual more potent. You and the other grotto participants should rehearse your lines, music cues and movements, but the Initiate should not be present. Preparation for the Initiate: The Initiate should be instructed to memorize the Nine Satanic Statements. He (She) must also wear a garb to the actual ritual that can be loosened at the neck, to be drawn down low enough to expose his heart. The Initiate should be instructed not to eat the day of the ritual. This is traditionally for reasons of purification and focus. If he (she) is so predisposed, instruct him to take a candlelit, ritual bath before leaving for his Initiation, washing away past guilts and fears and opening himself or herself to new experiences (using no scents or oils; the demons can be likened to wild beasts who will trust you more if they can smell you, unmasked by frankincense and myrrh). Other Grotto Participants should, as always, wear black ritual robes and Baphomets, with the addition of black, pointed hoods (with eye holes) covering their heads. 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Necessary Implements: All standard ritual implements, as listed in The Satanic Bible, and also: 1) A small box of earth (large enough for Initiate to place both hands in) 2) A brazier 3) Incense to throw over the coals 4) A chalice filled with water 5) A small container of tiger balm (or similar capsicum derivative that leaves a slightly tingly effect on the skin) 6) An envelope (preferably black) containing Celebrant's word for the Initiate 7) A small presentation pillow 8) Ablackrobe 9) A Baphomet pendant 10) Rope (cut in two pieces) 11) Black hood without eyeholes There should be a third Acolyte appointed to hand Celebrant necessary items in a timely enough manner to maintain the rhythm of the ritual. The Acolytes should alternate tasks as needed. As for music, an appropriate musical selection might be Albinoni's \"Adagio in G minor\" or Handel's Largo from \"Xerxes\", moving into Mussorgsky's \"Night on Bald Mountain\" for the conclusion of the ritual. Before the actual ceremony begins: Two of your appointed Acolytes will, upon a subtle signal from you, leave the area of general pre-ritual socializing and put on their black robes, Baphomets and hoods before the rest of the congregation does. They will then reappear in their black robes and hoods and approach the Initiate. (If the Initiate lives alone and you want a particularly dramatic effect, you might send the Acolytes to show up at his door to usher him to the ceremony.) They will escort him to a place (another room, a separate area of woods, outside the house, etc.) where they bind his hands and feet (make the feet-binding loose enough so he can walk by shuffling) and place a black hood (without eyeholes) over his head. The two Acolytes are forbidden to speak to the Initiate while they escort him and prepare him for the ritual. Once the Initiate is bound, he should be brought to the ritual site or ritual chamber through a circuitous route that disorients him, and wait with the Acolytes just beyond the chamber. In the interim, you and the rest of the grotto participants can put on your ritual garb, enter the ritual chamber and perform the standard ritual opening, Steps 3-7, according to the instructions found in The Satanic Bible. After invoking the four Crown Princes of Hell, reciting the First Enochian Key (after which, the gong is struck), and handing his sword to an awaiting Acolyte, the Celebrant should face the altar again and intone: Satan, our Dark Lord, please attend CELEBRANT: us. There is an Initiate who requests your attention, and approval. Hear his words, O Satan, and measure his worth. (ACOLYTES bring Initiate into the ritual chamber.

But the time has come to amend that response. We have grown steadily over the past 21 years and find that it is appropriate to have some clearer guidelines on, not only what we strive for, but also what we work to avoid-what we disapprove of. The difference is where other religions develop sins that people can't avoid, we consider a number of things \"sinful\" that people could avoid if they worked a little. 1) Stupidity.--The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardinal Sin of Satanism. It's too bad that stupidity isn't painful. Ignorance is one thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with whatever they are told. The media promotes a cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid. 2) Pretentiousness.--Empty posturing can be most irritating and isn't applying the cardinal rules of Lesser Magic. On equal footing with stupidity for what keeps the money in circulation these days. Everyone's made to feel like a big shot, whether they can come up with the goods or not. 3) Solipsism.--This can be very dangerous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions, responses, and sensibilities onto someone else who is probably less attuned than you are. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same consideration, courtesy, and respect that you naturally give them. They won't. Instead Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of \"Do unto others as they do unto you.\" It's work for most of us and requires constant vigilance lest you slip into a comfortable illusion of everyone being like you. As has been said, certain utopias would be ideal in a nation of philosophers, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, from a Machiavellian viewpoint) we are far from that point. 4) Self-Deceit.--It's in the Nine Satanic Statements but deserves to be repeated here. Another cardinal sin. We must not pay homage to any of the sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expected to play ourselves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is when it's fit, and with awareness. But then, it's not self-deceit! 5) Herd Conformity. --That's obvious from a Satanic stance. It's all right to conform to a person's wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you. The key is to choose a master wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of the many. 6) Lack of Perspective.--Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a threat you can be, by your very 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"existence. We are making history right now, everyday. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic. See the patterns and fit things together as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be swayed by herd constraints--know that you are working on another level entirely from the rest of the world. 7) Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies.--Be aware that this is one of the keys to brainwashing people into accepting something as \"new\" and \"different\", when in reality it's something that was once widely accepted but is now presented in a new package. We are expected to rave about the genius of the \"creator\" and forget the original. This makes for a disposable society. 8) Counterproductive Pride. --That first word is important. Pride is great up to the point you begin to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The rule of Satan ism is: If it works for you, great. When it stops working for you, when you've painted yourself into a corner and the only way out is to say, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I wish we could compromise somehow,\" then do it. 9) Lack of Aesthetics.--This is the physical application of the Balance Factor. It is important in Lesser Magic and should be cultivated. It is obvious that no one can collect any money off it most of the time so it is discouraged in a consumer society, but it is an essential Satanic tool and must be applied for magical effectiveness. It's not what's supposed to be pleasing--it's what ~. Aesthetics is a highly personal thing, reflective of one's own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious configurations that should not be denied. -Anton Szandor LaVey, 1987 c.e. 5) Most pseudo-Satanic groups are short-lived, running out of money enthusiasm or suckers before too long. An easier game comes along and they're off in a new direction. 6) How do they deal with Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan? This is tricky- -some current groups play the Christian game of handing out laurels with one hand while stabbing their progenitor in the back with the other. Others aren't so subtle, boldly claiming to be the \"true\" or \"evolved\" Church of Satan. To make their rationale work, they must somehow convince you that the author of The Satanic Bible isn't practicing pure Satanism and their brand is the straight stuff. Still others just ignore Anton LaVey altogether and hope you won't notice. 7) Be wary of the approach of \"You probably aren't smart enough to join us.\" The only way you can prove them wrong is by joining! From the first material you get, you feel you have to prove and defend yourself. Don't be fooled by big words, nice typing and/or fancy paper...and plenty of it. True Satanism builds the ego, it doesn't tear it down. 8) Beware of cults offering sex orgies and drugs, or killing animals in the name of Satan. As you well know, these are not part of Satanic practices. The leaders are copying the lame-brain spook stories from Geraldo or Oprah and obviously know less than you do. Use common sense. Don't let someone take advantage of you for his or her own perversity; examine motives carefully. 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"9) Some other groups to watch out for: A) Feminist, Wiccan-oriented, consciousness- raising groups who practice more male-bashing than magic; B) New Age groups that promote LaVeyan concepts, but shun the dreaded \"S\" word; C) Jargon-lad en Christians masquerading as Satanists; D) Pen-pal or lonely hearts social groups pretending to be elitists performing powerful Satanic rituals. Most of the above are subject to bitch-fights, petty jealousies, and rivalries. They are safe havens for small-minded people trying to play head games, preferring the protection of groups rather than really working to apply what Anton LaVey wrote. This is not to say that all groups are counterproductive to Satanism as a movement; there are many which are productive, supportive branches of the Church of Satan. Like various divisions of the same army, these distinct Orders may emphasize one Satanic image over another, but they are all aligned, in communication and working toward the same goals. But you must be prepared to sort the truth from the misinformation. Don't be fooled by self-declared \"Masters\", whether they're wearing white robes or black. They are attempting to misdirect and subvert whatever you've developed in the way of ego or identity. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Knowing this, if you choose to affiliate with an y pseudo-Satanic or anti-Satanic groups, you may well find yourself disaffiliated from the Church of Satan. Forewarned is forearmed. Which Do Witches Wear? Here are a few guidelines for the \"uniform\" of the compleat witch. Though all of these elements are highlighted in Anton LaVey's book on the use of feminine power, The Satanic Witch, this Is a distilled, easy-to-understand Cheat sheet. These are the first steps toward distinguishing yourself as a witch, unconstrained by the common fetters of \"freedom\" established by our Liberated Sisters. Why should we let transvestites be the only ones empowered to flaunt the trappings of women anymore? Many of these things are talismanic; perhaps no one will see them, but they are there for us to feel, as a constant reminder of who and what we are--pioneers in the Age of Fire. Women should stop living in fear that, if they dare dress like women, they'll either get criticized by other women or hassled by creeps on the street. If our society has degenerated to such a state of lawlessness that a woman can't wear a pair of high heels in public without inviting rape, then, to paraphrase Teddy Roosevelt, Satanic women better stand up on our hind legs, dress enticingly and carry a big stick—or whatever weapon it takes to protect ourselves. 1. Skirt or dress, straight cut, above the knee--we are the truly liberated! That means we use the power of being women as women. On one hand, women are told to love themselves and advance toward a position of authority in society; at the same time, fashions dictate that we dress as impotent little girls, trying to fit into our fathers' oversized clothes. This is senseless to the Satanic witch. Clingy, smooth fabrics are flattering to a woman's figure, with a belt to accent the waistline. Try to stick with classic V-neck lines. 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"2. High heels, at least 3\"--the classic witches' shoe. Most flattering to the leg, as It creates an inviting S-curve, and a nice jiggle to your walk without even trying. If you've never worn them, don't overestimate your shoe size. If they fit like your running shoes or sandals, they're too large. Give yourself time to learn to walk in them; skip an exercise class and give yourself a real workout! 3. No bikini underwear--always full-cut; white, off-white or dusty-pink; rayon or nylon (smooth-finish) panties. The bikini cut was designed for women with no curves. They are an anathema to the witch. They give no emphasis to your ample hips or pleasingly small waist. 4. No pantyhose--the enemy of every witch. They are nylon pants strangling our sex, allowing for no ventilation or freedom of movement. The classic seamed stocking was designed to augment the beauty of a woman's leg, the seam tracing the gentle curves, the dark contrasting top accenting a woman's seldom-glimpsed thigh. Make sure the stocking is proportioned so the top hits you just a couple of inches above the knee. No flashy colors. Beige-toned, smooth finish, seamed stockings are more eye-fetching than any purple-ribbed or paisley-flowered leg. 5. Garter belt--not the little sateen-covered rings of elastic that are thrown at weddings or that teenagers dangle from their rear-view mirrors. Hunt down a plain, white garter belt that goes around the waist. No frills, lace, or black and red imitation satin \"stage-undies\" that are designed for one night's use and will fall apart after you do your racy strip-tease for hubby. You want the 10,000 mile-kind, that lasts long enough to look dingy and soiled; the kind of underwear any decent, God-fearing woman would be mortified if a man glimpsed. 6. Vivid make-up--Use classic bright reds for your nails and lips. Eye shadow should be dramatic blues and greens. Blush should look rosy and pink, not like shades of brown and subtle earth-tones. \"Tasteful\" translates to \"that which will make others comfortable\". Don't be shy. It's to our advantage to stand out. 7. No perfumes or heavy deodorants--the scent of your own flesh is enticing enough. Perfumes Just Irritate. 8. No excessive jewelry--one ring on each hand is plenty. And you don't need to wear 3 or 4 necklaces at a time; weighing yourself down with heavy Jewelry only detracts from a woman's body. You don't need to mar yourself with tattoos and piercings to get attention. More than one earring in each ear doesn't highlight your best features, it camouflages them. A nose stud Just invites someone to try to wipe the booger off your nose. 9. No tattoos or piercings--don't permanently brand yourself as a slave to fashion. As Dr. LaVey has said, \"A woman should be a work of art; she shouldn't have to have art tattooed on her.\" 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Let them stare; let them marvel; let them tsk, tsk.
