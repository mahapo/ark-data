[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"MERKABA MEDITATION ACCORDING DRUNVALO MELCHIZEDEK written by Drunvalo Melchizedek Posted Mon, 26-Dec-1994 00:40:00 GMT The Teaching On Spherical Breathing Like the sun, we must breath, radiating out to all life. And from all life we will receive our manna. Begin by creating a place in your home that is used only for this meditation. Make a space where no one will walk through or disturb you, possi bly in your bedroom. A small altar with a candle and a cushion or pillow to sit upon may be helpful. Make this place holy. It is here that you will learn to create the MER-KA-BA around your body and make conscious contact with your higher self. Once each day, enter into this meditation, unti l the time comes when you are a conscious breather, remembering with each breath your intimate connection with God. To begin the meditation, first sit down and relax. Let the worries of the day go. Breathe rhythmically and shallow. Be aware of your brea th and relax. When you feel the tension begin to fade, begin to open your heart. Feel Love. Feel Love for all life everywhere. Continue to breathe rhythmically, being aware of your breath , and feel the Love moving through your spirit. When the FEELING of love is in your beingness, you are ready to begin to move towards the experience to the MER-KA-BA . Without this Love, no amount of knowledge will create the MER-KA-BA . To the degree you are able to Love, w ill be the degree you will be able to experience the MER-KA-BA . The following is an overview of the meditation to reach the MER-KA-BA . There are seventeen breaths to reach completion. The first six are for balancing of the polarities within your eight electical circuits, and, also, for the cleansing of these circuits. The next seven, which are quite different, are to re-e stablish the proper pranic flow through your body, and to recreate Spherical Breathing within your body. The fourteen th breath is unique unto itself. It changes the balance of pranic energy within your body fro m third dimensional to fourth dimensional awareness. The last three breaths r ecreate the rotating fields of the MER-KA-BA within and around your body. The instructions: The following instructions will be broken down into four areas: MIND , BODY , BREATH and HEART FIRST BREATH: Inhale HEART : Open your heart and feel love for all li fe. If you cannot do this, you must at least open to this love as much as is possible for you. This is the most important instruction of all. MIND : Become aware of the male tetrahedron (the apex facing up to the sun, the point facing to the front for male, the point to the back for females) filled with the brilliant white light surrounding your body. Visualize it the best you can. If you cannot visualize it, sense or feel it surrounding you."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"BODY : At the same moment of inhalation, place your hands in the mudra of your thumb and first finger touching. Remember, lightly to uch your fingers, and do no t allow your fingers to touch each other or any other ob ject. Keep your palms facing up. BREATH : At this same moment, with empty lungs, begin to breath in a complete yogic manner. Breathe through your nostrils only, except at certain places which will be described. Simply put, breath from your stomach first, then your diaphragm, and finally your chest. Do this in one movement, not three parts. The exhale is completed either by holding the chest firm and relaxing the stomach, slowly releasing the air, or by holding the stomach firm and relaxing the chest. The most important aspect is that this breathing must be rhythmic. Begin by using seven seconds in and seven seconds out, but as you get familiar with this meditation, find your own rhythm. The following instructions for a comp lete Yogic Breath are from \"the Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath\" by Yogi Ramacharake. Pe rhaps this description will be helpful. Breathing through the nostrils, inhale steadily, first filling the lower part of the lungs, which is accomplished by bringing into play the diaphragm, which descending exerts a gentle pressure on the abdominal organs, pushing forward the front walls of the abdomen. Then fill the middle part of the lungs, pushing ou t the lower ribs, breastbone a nd chest. Then fill the higher portion of the lungs, protruding the upper chest, thus lif ting the chest, includi ng the upper six or even pairs of ribs. At first reading it may appear that this breath consists of three distinct movements. This, however, is not the correct idea. The inhalation is continuous, th e entire chest cavity from the lowered diaphragm to the highest point of the chest in the region of the collar bone, being expanded with a uniform movement. Avoi d a jerky series of inhalations, and strive to attain a steady con tinuous action. Practice wi ll soon overcome the tendency to divide the inhalation into three movements, and will resu lt in a uniform continuous breath. You will be able to complete the inhalation in a few seconds after a little practice. Exhale quite slowly, holding the chest in a firm position, and drawing the abdomen in a little and lifting it upward as the ai r leaves the lungs. When the air is entirely exhaled, relax the chest and abdomen. A little practice will render this part of the exercise easy, and the movement once acquired will be afterward performed almost automatically. FIRST BREATH: Exhale HEART : Love MIND : Become aware of the female tetrahedro n, (apex pointing to th e earth, point facing to the back for males, point facing to the front for females), also filled with the brilliant white light BODY : Keep the same mudra. BREATH : Do NOT hesitate at the top of the inhalation to begin the exhalation. Exhale quite slowly, approximately seven seconds, in the Yogic manner. When the air is out of the lungs, without forcing, relax the chest a nd abdomen and HOLD the breath. When you feel pressure to breathe again, after about five seconds or so, then do the following: MIND : Be aware of the flat equilateral triangle at the top of the female tetrahedron located in the horizontal plane that passes through your chest at the sternum. In a flash, and with a pulse like energy, send that triangular plane down through the female tetrahedron. It gets"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"smaller as it goes down and pushes out the tip or apex of the tetrahedron all the negative energy of the mudra or electrical circuit, a light will shoot out of the apex toward the centre of the Earth. The Mind exercise is perf ormed along with the following BODY movements. BODY : Move your eyes slightly toward each other, or, in other words, slightly cross your eyes. Now bring them up to the top of their so ckets, or in other words, look up. Also, this looking up motion should not be extreme. You will feel a tingling feeling between your eyes in the area of your third eye. You can now look down to the lowest point you can, as fast as you can. You should feel an electrical sensation mo ve down your spine. The MIND and BODY must coordinate the above mental exercise w ith the eye movements. The eyes look down from their up position at the same time the mind sees the triangular horizontal plane of the female tetrahedron move down to the apex of the female tetrahedron. This combined exercise will clean out the negative thoughts and feelings that have entered into your electrical sy stem. Specifically, it will clean out the part of your electrical system that is associated with the particular mudra you are using. Immediately upon pulsi ng the energy down your spine, you change mudras to the next one and begin the entire cy cle over again. The next five brea ths are a repeat of the first breath with the following mudra changes: Second breath mudra : Thumb and second finger together Third breath mudra : Thumb and third finger together Fourth breath mudra : Thumb and little finger together Fifth breath mudra : Thumb and first finger together (same as first breath) Sixth breath mudra : Thumb and second finger together (same as second breath) The first part, the first six breaths, the bala ncing of the polarities, and the cleansing of your electrical system is now complete. You ar e now ready for the next part, the next seven breaths. Here an entirely new breathing pattern begins . You do not need to visualize the star tetrahedron at this time. Only th e tube that runs through the st ar, from the apex of the male tetrahedron above your head to th e apex of the female tetrahedr on below your feet, needs to be seen and worked with. This extends one ha nd length above your head and one hand length below your feet. The diameter of YOUR tube will be the size of th e hole formed by YOUR thumb and forefinger touching. BREATH NUMBER SEVEN: Inhale HEART : Love. There is another refinement here th at can be used afte r you have perfected this meditation. It will be discussed in class. MIND : Visualize or sense the tube running through your body. The instant you begin the seventh inhale, see the brilliant white light of the prana moving down the tube from the top and up the tube from the bottom at the same time. This movement is almost instantaneous. The point where these two light beams m eet within your body is controlled by the mind and is a vast science known throughout the universe. In this teaching however, we will only be shown what is necessary , that which will take you from third to fourth dimensional awareness. In this case you will direct the two b eams of prana to meet at your navel, or more correct, within your body at navel level, inside the tube . The moment the two beams of pr ana meet, which is just as the inhale begins, a sphere of white light or prana is formed at the meeting point about the size of a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"grapefruit centred on the tube. It all happens in an instant. As you continue to take the inhale of the seventh breath, the sphere of prana be gins to concentrate and grow slowly. BODY For the next seven breaths use the same mudra for both inhale and exhale, the thumb, first and second touching together palms up. BREATH : Deep rhythmic Yogic breathing, seve n seconds in and seven seconds out. There is no holding of the breath from now on. The flow of prana from the two poles will not stop or change in any way when you go from inhale to exhale. It will be a continuous flow that will not stop for a long as you breath in this manner, even after death. SEVENTH BREATH: Exhale MIND : The prana sphere centred at the navel co ntinues to grow. By the time of the full exhale, the prana sphere will be approximately eight or nine inches in diameter. BREATH : Do not force the air out of your lungs. When your lungs are empty naturally, immediately begin the next breath. EIGHTH BREATH: Inhale HEART : Love. MIND : The prana sphere continues to concentr ate life force energy and grow in size EIGHT BREATH: Exhale MIND : The prana sphere continues to grow in size and will reach maximum size at the end of this breath. This maximum size is different for each person. If you put your longest finger in the centre of your navel, the line on your wrist defining your hand will show you the radius of the maximum size of this sphere for YOU. This sphere of prana cannot grow larger. NINTH BREATH: Inhale MIND : The prana sphere cannot grow larger, so what happens is the prana begins to concentrate within the sphere. The visual a ppearance is that the sphere grows BRIGHTER. BREATH : Sphere grows brighter an d brighter as you inhale. NINTH BREATH: Exhale BREATH : As you exhale, the sphere continues to grow brighter and brighter. TENTH BREATH: Inhale MIND : About half way through this inhale, as th e sphere continues to brighter, the prana sphere reaches critical mass. The sphere ignites into a sun, a br illiant blinding ball of white light. You are now ready for the next step."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TENTH BREATH: Exhale MIND : At the moment of exhale, the small sphe re two hand lengths in diameter bulges to expand. In one second, combined with the breat h talked about below, the sphere expands quickly out to the sphere of Leonardo, out at your finger tips of your extended arms. Your body is now completely enclosed within a huge sphere of brilliant white light. You have returned to the ancient form of spherical brea thing. However, at this point, this sphere is not stable. You MUST breath three more times to keep the sphere stable. BREATH : At the moment of exhale, make a small hole with your lips and blow out your air with pressure. As you feel the sphere begin to bulge, all within the first second of this exhale, let all of your air out ra pidly. The sphere will ex pand at that moment. PART 3: ELEVENTH, TWELFTH and THIRTEENTH BREATH: Inhale and Exhale MIND : Relax and just feel the flow of the pr ana flowing from the two poles and meeting at the navel and then expanding out to the large sphere. BREATH : Breath rhythmically and deep. At the e nd of the thirteenth breath you have stabilized the large sphere and are re ady for the important 14th breath. THE FOURTEENTH BREATH HEART : Love MIND : On the inhale of the 14th breath, at th e very beginning of the breath, move the point where the two beams of prana meet from th e navel to the sternum, the fourth dimensional chakra. The entire large sphere, along with the or iginal sphere, which is also still contained within the large sphere, moves up to the new meeting point within the tube. Though this is very easy to do, it is an extremely powerful movement. Breathing from this new point within the tube will inevitably change your awareness from third to fourth dimensional consciousness, or from earth consciousness to Christ consciousness. It will take awhile, but as I have said , it is inevitable. BODY : This mudra will be used for the rest of the meditation. Place the left palm on top of the right palm for males and the right palm on t op of the left palm for females. It is a mudra that relaxes. BREATH : Rhythmic breath and deep. However, if you continue to breathe from your Christ centre without moving on to the MER-KA-BA , which is what is recommended until you have made contact with your Higher Self, then shif t to a shallow breath. In other words, breath rhythmically but in a comfortable manner where your attention is more on the flow of energy moving up and down the tube meetin g at the sternum and expanding out to the large sphere. Just feel the flow. Use your feminine side to just be . At this point don’t thin k, just breath, feel and be. Feel your connection to All Life throug h the Christ Breath. Remember your intimate connection with God."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The Mer-Ka-Ba, The Vehicle Of Ascension The Last Three Breaths You are asked not to attempt this FOURTH PART until you have made contact with your Higher Self, AND your Higher Self has given you permission to pro ceed. This part is to be taken seriously. The energies that will come into and around your body and spirit are of tremendous power. If you are not ready, you could hurt yourself. If your Higher Self gives you permission to enter into the MER-KA-BA , then don t fear, for you will be ready. FIFTEENTH BREATH: Inhale: HEART : Love MIND : Be aware of the whole star tetrahedron. Realize that there are three whole star tetrahedrons superimposed over each other. One is the body itself, and is locked in place and never, except under certain conditions, move s. It is placed around the body according to maleness or femaleness. The second whole star tetrahedron is male in nature, it is electrical, is literally the human mind and rota tes counter-clockwise relative to your body looking out, or to put it another way, it rotates toward your left side. The third whole star tetrahedron is female in nature, is magnetic, is literally the human em otional body and rotates cl ockwise relative to your body looking out, or to put it another way, it rotates to ward your right side. To be clear, we are not telli ng you to rotate the male tetr ahedron one way and the female the other way. When we say rota te the whole star tetrahedron, we mean the whole thing. On the inhale of the fifteenth breath, as you are inhaling, you will sa y to yourself, in your head, the code words, EQUAL SPEED. This will tell your mind that you want the two rotatable whole star tetrahedrons to begin spinning in opposite directions at equal speeds at the time of the exhale. Meaning that for every complete rotation of the mind tetrahedrons, there will be a complete rotation of the emotional tetrahedrons. BODY : Continue the mudra of the folded hands from now on. BREATH : Breath Yogic and rhythmically an deeply again, but only for the next three breaths, after that return to the shallow breathing. FIFTEENTH BREATH: Exhale MIND : The two sets of tetrahedrons take off spinning. In an instant, they will be moving at exactly one third the speed of light at their oute r tips. You probably will not be able to see this because of their tremendous speed, but you can feel it. What you have just done is to start the MOTOR of the MER-KA-BA . You will not go anywhere, or have an experience. It is just like starting the motor of a car, but havi ng the transmission in neutral. BREATH : Make a small hole with your lips just like you did for breath Number Ten. Blow out in the same manner, and as you do, feel th e two sets of tetrahedr ons take off spinning."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SIXTEENTH BREATH: Inhale MIND : This is the most amazing breath. On the inhale, as you are inhaling, say to yourself, in your head, THIRTY-F OUR - TWENTY-ONE. This is th e code to your mind to spin the two sets of tetrahed rons at a ratio of 34-21. Meaning th e Mind tetrahedrons spinning to the left will go around 34 times while the emotional tetrahedrons spinning to the right will go around 21 times. As the two sets speed up the ratio will remain constant. BREATH : Breathe rhythmically and Yogic. SIXTEENTH BREATH: Exhale MIND : As you let out the breathe, the two sets of tetrahedrons take off from their one third speed of light setting to two third speed of light in an instant. As they approach two thirds speed of light speed a phenomena takes place. A disk about 55 feet in diameter forms around the body at the level of the base of the spine. And the sphere of en ergy that is centred around the two sets of tetrahedrons forms with the disk to create a shape th at looks like a FLYING SAUCER around the body. This energy matrix is called the MER-KA-BA . However, it is not stable. If you see or sense the MER-KA-BA around you at this point, you will know it to be unstable. It will be slowly wobbling. Theref ore Breath Number Seventeen is necessary. BREATH : Same as breath 16, make a small hole in your lips, and blow out with pressure. It is at this point that the speeds increases. As you feel the speed increasing, let out all your breath with force. This action will cause th e higher speed to be fully obtained and the MER- KA-BA to be formed. SEVENTEENTH BREATH: Inhale HEART : Remember, unconditional love for all life must be felt through out all of this meditation or no results will be realized. MIND : As you breathe in, say to yourself, in your head, the code NINE TENTHS THE SPEED OF LIGHT. This code will tell your mind to increase the speed of the MER-KA-BA to nine tenths the speed of light which will stabili ze the rotating field of energy. It will also do something else. This third dimensional universe th at we live in is tuned to 9/10 the speed of light. Every electron in your body is rotating around every atom in your body at 9/10 the speed of light. This is the reason this particular speed is selected. BREATH : Breathe rhythmically and in a Yogic manner. SEVENTEENTH BREATH: Exhale MIND : The speed increases to 9/10 the speed of light and stabilizes the MER-KA-BA . BREATH : Same as breath 15 and 16, make a small hole in your lips, and blow out with pressure. As you feel the speed take off, let all your breath out with fo rce. You are now in your stable and Third dimensionally tuned MER-KA-BA . With the help of your Higher Self, you will understand what this really means."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"EIGHTEENTH BREATH: This very special breath will not be taught here. You must receive it from Your Higher Self. It is the breath that will take you through the speed of light into the fourth dimension. You will disappear from this world and reappear in another one that will be your new home for awhile. This is not the end, but the beginning of an ever expanding consciousness returning you HOME to your FATHER.
