Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 3-33). In the Terry Lectures given at Yale University in 1937, a demonstration is proposed of the persective from which medical psychology views religion. Religi on must be taken into account by psychologists, since it represents one of the most ancient and universal expr essions of the human mind; but it is felt that the approach of psychology must be scientif ic, empirical and phenomenological rather than p hilosophical or metaphysical. Religion is defined for the purposes of this study as the belief in an external dynamic force which controls the human subject , and as the ritual acts carried out by men to p roduce the effect of this dynamic force, the numinosum . Religion is seen as an attitude of mind rather than any creed, although the creed is a codified form of the original religious e xperience. In the story of a patient who was convinced he had cancer, but whose re al difficulty lay in obse ssive drives he did not want to recognize, the desire of men in general to avoid revelatory contact with the unconscious is stressed; from primitive times to the present, man is seen to construct ritual and taboo to protect him from the voices of his dreams and the content of his unconscious. The definite forms and laws of the Church are seen in this light. Two dreams with specif ically religious manifestations are briefly analyzed to demonstrate the existence of these inner voices a nd experiences, particularly the two figures of the anima and animus. Each is seen as a psychic repr esentation of the minority of genes in the body; the anima, or female figure, appears in the imagery of th e male's unconscious, and vice versa. It is felt that the processes of the unconscious ar e just as continuously active as those of the conscious mind, and that dreams are manifestations of this chain of events that can be experienced in the conscious.

The importance of drea m analysis as a means of contacting the unc onscious is stressed in an account of the therapy of a particular patient , a scientist who had numerous drea ms of a religious or mystical character. The unconscious is seen as the comp letion and enrichment of the personality, having a superior insight and knowledge lacki ng in the conscious self. The integr ation of all parts of the mind is considered the ideal goal of therapy. The Catholic defenses against immediate experience and its ambiguity in the particular case cited are simila r to other religious dogma and pagan ritual which represent the formalized acting-out of psychic material so that the individual need not confront that material directly, immediately, in his own unconscious. It is obser ved that Protestantism, having divested itself of much of the ritual and codes of the Catholic Church, leaves the individual to confront his sins alone; this development has led to the un easiness and anxiety, but al so to the alertness and analytic nature of modem society. The dreams reported in the case study are examined for their archetypal material, those primordial ideas or tendencies of thought which are common to all human p sychic experience. The significance of the number four, represented in one dream by a pyramidal shape, is discussed in its many manifestations in other dreams a nd in the history of myth and religious thought. Other alchemical symbols a ssociated with the number four ar e the circle and the Philosopher's Stone. The latter symbol of the perf ect living being is found to be an allegory of the Deity repeated by a number of early theorists. The Christian representa tion of God and the Trinit y is compared to other systems in which the Deity is repr esented by the unity of four elements; the missing fourth element in rehgious doctrine is seen as the Devil. Although this fourth elemen t is suppressed in the Christian religion in an expression of certain moral and ment al attitudes of the prac titioners, the unconscious supplies the fourth element in its various manifestati ons. 7 references. 000348 Ps y cholo gy and reli g ion. 3.

A circle divided into four parts, the Philosopher's Stone, is a symbol th at seems to recur throughout history. Four elements, four colors, and quaternity of gods co rrespond to the four parts of the circ le,- in the Western tradition the fourth part of these systems is earth, blue, and Ma ry respectively. The fourth part is slow in being accepted as it is part of the eternal duality of h eaven and hell, air and earth, male and female; it is symbolized in dreams by the anim a, that part of the unconsci ous suppressed by the male. The unconscious and the conscious striving for unity, are symbolized by the mandala and the squaring of the circle, collective symbols found in dreams. In modern times, no deity is observed to be symbolized in the center, but there is some repres entation of the center as the self. A self that has merged conscious and and unconscious has come to te rms with its shadow. It is thr ough knowing the dark side of of p syche -the shadow -- that we find salvation, for the repressed or suppressed shadow fights to the surface in even more frightening forms. Gods are not created, they are taken on. There is no freedom of choice; if one has an unconscious desire, it is really the desire that possesses him. Part of accepting one's p syche as one's self is realizing what is there and reconciling it with one's consciousness. There is the symbolic circle holding together th e four parts of the stone, or the re alization of the wholeness of man. These symbols of wholeness and unity recur throughout history in dreams and other psychic manifestations seemingly without th e influence of tradition or knowledge of religion of any type. Such a continuity can only exist if one assumes certain unconscious thought forms or archetypes to be an inherited a priori process. Accordingly, an archetype is a structural quality or condition peculiar to the p syche, but somehow connected with the brain. The ma ndala symbolizes belief, and neurosis a lack of faith. The choice between mandala and neurosis is deeply personal and subjective, but the continual choice of the mandala throu ghout history is seen as an objective fact. 7 references. 000349 A psychological approach to the d ogma of the Trinity. Introduction. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princet on University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 107-111). It is contended that in a psychological study of Chri stian symbolism, which i nvolves a dissection of the dogma of the Trinity, neither the validity nor the sacr edness of the symbols ex amined is in question; they are studied in terms of their psychic function. This study, far from degrading the value of these symbols, is considered to be a confirmation of thei r essential nature as part of the human psyche. 000350 Psychological approach to the dogma of th e Trinity. 1. Pre-Christian parallels. 1. Babylonia. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 112-115). Primitive pre-Christian antecedents to the Trinit y are explored. There have been many primitive symbolic triads, one of the most important being the Babylonian triad of Anu, Bel, and Ea. Anu was the lord of heaven; Bel was the lord of the lower realm, earth; and Ea was the god of the lower realm of the watery depths. In most of these pr imitive triads there were some fa mily relationships, mostly father-son although there were ot hers. Another theme involves one member of the triad being part man and part god. Analogies between Babylonian and al chemical symbols are mentioned. 000351 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 1. Pre-Christian parallels. 11. Egypt. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 115-117). An ancient Egyptian, archetypal, pre- Christian antecedent of the Trin ity is described, in which three gods -- the homoousia of Father and Son, and ka, the pr ocreative power of the de ity -- form a triunity not unlike the Christian symbolic configuration. The passing of these ideas into the Hellenic Osir- is/Horus/Isis m y th is noted, as is its influence on Christian do g ma. 1 reference."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"000352 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 1. Pre-Christian parallels. III. Greece. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 117-128). The mathematical speculations of the Greek philosophers are discus sed as important pre-Christian antecedents of the number symbolism of the Trinit y. One is the number from which all others have sprung and is perfect, being neither male or female, odd or even. Tw o or the \"other\" as it is called in some languages, divided the qualities into good and ba d, male and female, heaven and hell. Both one and two are necessary beca use as a single element one would be shapeless and two nonexistent. On the second day of creation evil was made, making two a sinister number. The number three is the first uneven number and is a masculine number. Three defines form, whereas tw o only designates a two dimensional plane. The three points are combined into an equilateral triangle to symbolize the trinity. The number four is left out of Gr eek number symbolism and denied because it is a female number, and is not well understood. Plato tried to explain the creation in terms of mixing the di visible and the indivisible, and in terms of the mixing of the same wi th the different. It is the combination of these two p airs that gives us the combination mean and the third form. The description of this combination encircled is the sign for city and corr esponds with the mandala. 2 references. 000353 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 2. Father, Son and Spirit. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd e d., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 129- 137). The archetypal model for the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) is discussed as it ma nifests itself in Greek philosophy. The three Persons conceived by Plato are noted to be related by opposition, while the Christian Trinity is based on unity. It is concluded that the Christian symbol did not derive from the Greek, but rather that both were derived and conceptu alized from more ancient archetypal elements. The relationship of the Holy Ghost in the Trinity, that of a life force proceeding fr om both Father and Son, is observed to resemble Egyptian kingship theology more than Greek. In both these symbolic systems the feminine element is excluded. The figure of the Son as the revealed God is seen also in the Persian symbol of Gayornart, the Original Man, and later in the Gnostic redeemer figures; but the archetype's actual origin is unknown, prehistorical. The other figur es in the Trinity are considered to have the same eternal nature. It is noted that only recently has Christianity beco me aware of and accepted to some extent the similarities of their dogma with the dogma and ritual of other cults. 000354 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 3.

The unfolding of the archetype of the Trinity in Christian dogma is examined, and the various textual formulations of the Trinit y relationship are mentioned as successive attempts to give rational symbolic expression to a primordial archetype . The first attempt to summarize these preconscious beliefs is the Apostle's Creed; in it the Trinity is latent, and it s members are interchangeable in name and function. 1 reference. 000355 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 3.

The text of the Nicene Creed is gi ven as an example of one of the at tempts to explain the relationship between the figures of the Trinity. It is noted th at in this creed the Father and the Son have a homoousian relationship; that is, they are from the sa me substance. The Holy Ghost is not included in the creed. 1 reference. 000357 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 3. The symbola. IV. The Nicaeno- Constantinopolitanum, the Atha nasianum, and the Lateranense. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton Univer sity Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 144-147). Three explanations of the Trinity are repr esented by the Nicaeno-C onstantinopolitanum, the Athanasianum, and the Lateranense cree ds. The Holy Ghost is seen in th e first as equal with the Father and the Son, but he proceeds from the Father only. Th e Athanasian creed insisted on the equality and eternality of the three persons. In the Creed of the Lateran Council, th e three are declared equal but the Son is begotten by the Father, and the Holy G host comes from both the Father and the Son. 000358 A psychological approach to th e dogma of the Trinity. 4. The three persons in the light of psychology. 1. The hypothes is of the archetype. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 148-152). According to the archetype hypothesi s, which states that some tendencies of mind predate the conscious development of man, all religious theory and cr eed surrounding the Trinity has grown up around the archetypal idea of a triad. The statem ent that dogmas are inspired by the Holy Ghost indicates that they are not the product of conscious cogitation and speculation but are engendered by sources outside consciousness and possibly even outside man. The hi story of the Trinity is seen as the gradual crystallization of one of these archetypes. 000359 A psychological approach to th e dogma of the Trinity. 4.

Christ is seen as a major manifestation of the collective unconscious that is forced into a ratio nal/refigious structure. Christ, the God man, has little personal history; instead, history has forced itself on him. He is the archetypal her o, showing all the signs: improbabl e origin, divine father, hazardous birth, precocious development, conquest of the mother and of death, mi raculous deeds, a tragic, early end, a symbolically significant manner of death, a wide range of consequences of his death. The symbol of self and the God image are indi stinguishable. The self is thus s ynonymous with the inner Christ; it is the god within the psychic totality of the individual. Anything man postulates as being a greater totality than himself becomes a symbol of the self. The Christ figure itself is incomplete because it lacks evil, a necessary part of nature. It is th rough a blending of good and evil th at self-realization is reached. The self embraces the inconceivable unconsciousness in the fo rm of symbols, as the archetypal life of Christ is described in symbolic images. 000360 A psychological approach to th e dogma of the Trinity. 4.

Jun g , Vol. 11. 2nd ed.,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 157-163). The Holy Ghost holds a unique position in the Trinity in that it is his function to propagate faith in man. It is through this faith engendering function, simila r to the life engendering relationship between the Father and the Son that we are children of God. The Ho ly Ghost did not arise from the natural situation; rather he is a product of human reflection added on to the natural sequence of fa ther and son. To try to understand the Holy Ghost as a feminine archetype w ould be to ignore the qualities of a life common to the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost's role of procreating in man and bri nging forth the works of the divine parentage. The forces that motivate tr initarian thinking are impe rsonal, arising from the collective psyche; they express an un conscious far surpassing all personal needs -- that of the integration of the unconscious with the conscious , which makes man a psychic whole. 000361 A ps y cholo g ical approach to the do g ma of the Trinit y . 5. The problem of the fourth. 1. The concept of quaternity. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. It. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 164-180). The power of the dogma of the Trinity is readily acknowledged, but there seems to be a part that is missing. It is the fourth function of the conscious psyche, the feeli ng function, that does not cooperate. The other three: thinking, sensatio n, and intuition follow rational thought , but the fourth, feeling, is a regressive state allied with the unconscious. It can be suppressed but only at the expense of the conscious function. From this archet ypal structure come other natural quaternities into which the world seems to be divided according to various philosophies~ others are the four elements, four prime qualities, four colors, four castes, etc. Already in the Trinity there are three parts to the quaternity: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The fourth part must be the devil or Lucifer, sin ce in the basic duality of the structure of nature, good must ha ve evil to have substance. The relationship among the elements of the Trinity and the fourth element is explored. It is fr om the Father that Satan sprang, for he is called the first Son , and Christ the second Son, This places Ch rist, who stands for all that is good, in opposition to Satan, who is evil. Christ cannot overcome Satan on hi s own, instead he requires the ministrations of the Holy Ghost, a reconciliation of opposites and hence the answer to the human suffering that Christ p ersomfies. In the diagram of the quaternity, man's salv ation is shown in the form of the cross, itself a quaternity. It is contended that there can be no su ch thing as \"beyond good and evil,\" that the notion only encourages self-deification, and that what is n eeded to reconcile the tw o is the holy and unifying spirit and comfort of the Holy Ghost. 1 reference. 000362 A psychological approach to the dogma of the Trinity. 5.

To interpret the Trinity symbol psychologically it is c onsidered important to begi n at the individual level and to regard the symbol as an expression of the psyc he, It is possible to do this because the collective ideas represented in religious dogma are derived from the individual consciousness. The Father represents the early state of development of consci ousness. This consciousness is a passive unreflecting state of awareness without any intellectual or mo ral judgment. In a second transformation, the Son usurps the Father's role by forming a violent identification with the fa ther and by subsequently killing the father. This is not in itself an advancement, but it does force the isolated individual to discriminate and reflect rather than to simply act out of necessity or ignoranc e. The third transformation is the recognition of the unconscious and subordination to it through the union of psychic opposites with no p ersonal designation. 000363 A psychological approach to the dogma of th e Trinity. 5.

Jun g , Vol. 11 - 2nd ed.,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 187-192) The fourth element of the archetype of unity a nd redemption, missing in the Christian concept of Trinity, is characterized as the el ement of oppositon, which alone can give the triad reality. No other formulation will satisfy the needs of the unconscious. This, then, is the function of all symbols; they are allegorical representations of the unconscious pr ocesses, accepted universally because they are recognized by the unconscious. The quaternity symbol as one of these archetypal manifestations is seen to occur in dreams as well as the consciously cons tructed dogmas and rituals; some typical appearances of four figures in dreams are review ed. Since the unity of the four is completion of the religious and p sychic experience, the imago Dei aspect of the quaternity may be identified with the self. The implications of these archetypal sym bol structures for the psychotherapist are considered; it is felt that neurotic dissociations cannot be re paired by intellectual or purely pr actical methods, but rather by the integration of symbolic dream images into the patient's consciousness. 000364 A psychological approach to the d ogma of the Trinity. 6. Conclusion. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princet on University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 193-200). The Trinity expresses man's need for spiritual devel opment and independent thinking, but this is not the only activity of the psyche. It is through the essential unity of the three part process (Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) that unconscious maturation occurs in the form of instinctive, psychic, and regularly timed occurrences. The symbolic expression of the trinity is seen as a conti . nuing c onscious realization that has occurred over the centuries. The three forms of G od differ in that the Son proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Ghost comes from both the Father and th e Son; the Son is understood as the symbol of self and the Holy Ghost as the self's actualization in ma n where man enters in unity with the substance of God. A fourth and largely ignored symbol is the fi rst Son or the fallen a ngel; he is eternal and autonomous. He is the Antichn . st; it is the oppositon between the trinity and the first Son that makes a whole. This symbol is the realization of evil that completes the self. Individuation requires the realization of the shadow as a part of one's personali ty and the integration of it into one's consciousness. Religion is the revealed or dogmatic way to indi viduation; it is a formalization of preconscious knowledge valid for the unconscious even if our intellect does not grasp it. 1 reference. 000365 Transformation symbolism in the Mass. 1. Introduction. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton Univer sity Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 201-207). In the introduction to the topic of sources of the Ma ss, several references to transformation in the Bible are cited, partic ularly in I Corinthians. Two distinct ideas are seen to be blended in the Mass: the first idea is thysia, from the word to slaughter or sacrific e, means the flaring of the sacrificial fire when the gift offered to the Gods is consum ed; the second is deipnon, mearting a meal at which sacrificial food is eaten. Hebrews 13:10-15 is also considered a possi ble source for the Mass. In it are the ideas of p erpetual sacrifice and eternal prie sthood, both essential in the Mass. Ho wever, it is th e transformation that is the miracle of the Mass. Its ritual amplifie s this transformation step by step until the climax is reached -- the consecration. It is at this moment that Christ is pr esent in time and space as the revelation of something existing in eternity. Th e rite is necessarily and in each of its parts a symbol seeking to describe the mystery of the human psyche. 000366 Transformation symbolism in the Mass. 2.

The symbolic valu e of that part of the Mass in which wa ter and wine are mixed in the chalice is examined. It is noted that in many early rituals the chalice contained onl y water; this fact is taken to indicate that the interest of the Mass lies in the sy mbolism rather than in the strict observation of the sacrament. 000368 Transformation symbolism in the Mass. 2.

After the lifting of the chalice in the Mass, the Holy Spirit is considered to be infused in the wine; the priest then makes the sign of the cross three times. It is noted that he signs twice from right to left, in a counterclockwise movement which corresponds psychologically to a movement downwards towa rd the realm of the unconscious; he then signs once left to right, or upward in the direction of the conscious. The censing is the last act in the preparation of priest and congregation for the transubstantiation. 000369 Transformation s y mbolism of the Mass. 2. The sequence of the transformation rite. V.

The Epiclesis, final act in the Chri stian Mass, is described its it was practiced in different times and by different peoples. At the end of th e Mass ritual everything has been pr epared for the appearance of the Lord, and the invocation is said naming or summoni ng the Lord. The actual manifestation of the Lord was the culminating point of the Mass. 000370 Transformation symbolism of the Mass. 2. Th e sequence of the tran sformation rite. VI. The consecration. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 214-216). The significance and symbolism of the Consecrati on, the climax of the Roman Mass in which the transubstantiation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is believed to occur, are examined. Particular attention is given to the word s of Consecration showing that, since they represent the actual words of Christ speaking in the first pe rson, Christ becomes both the gift and giver in this ritual act. References to the explanations of th e Consecration provided by John of Damascus, Duns Scotus and the Council of Trent reveal the belief that, at this moment, Christ renews, in a bloodless fashion, His sacrificial death on the cross. The sacr amental words are examined as a metaphor for the sacrificial sword or knife by which th is death was accomplished. It is c oncluded that several of the ritual acts of the Roman Mass, as well as the Consecratio n rite of the Greek Orthodox Church, are symhols of the death of Christ. 000371 Transformation symbolism of the Mass. 2.

The symbolism of the greater elevation and the post-consecration prayers in the Roman Mass is examined. The elevation of the cons ecrated substances and the prayers that follow this portion of the mass are seen as symbolic representa tion of Christ's sacrific ing himself to God. The prayer itself is cited and the Scriptural allusion to the sacrifices of Abel, Abraham and Me lchisedec, contained therein, are explained. 000372 Transformation symbolism of the Mass. 2.

The ritual acts of the Roman Mass that occur at th e end of the Canon and after the recitation of the Our Father are examined. The sign of the cross made with the Host over the chalice is seen as an affirmation of the unity of all parts of the sacrifice; the fractio or breaking of the Host over the chalice is considered to be symbolic of Christ's deat h. Differences in the Byzantine and Mozarabic rituals of fractio are described in terms of the symbolic significance of the number of parts into which the Host is broken. 000373 Transformation symbolism of the Mass. 2.

The symbolism of the consignatio and commixtio portions of the Roman Mass is discussed. After making the sign of the cross with a fragment of the Host over the chalice, the particula is dropped into the wine, symbolizing the reunion of soul and body. Earl ier rites involving the us e of water or honey and milk instead of wine are mentione d and the interpretation of commixtio in the \"Leorrine Sacramentary\" is described. 'The relationship of the commixtio and the baptism rituals is discussed showing that the former reverses the symbolism of the latter and be comes a symbol of the resurrection. 000374 Transformation symbolism in the Mass. 2.

The Christian religious Mass as a whole is described as a codification of the life and sufferings of Christ: the prefiguration, the incarnation, the passion and death on the cross, the descent into hell, and the resurrection. The archetypal symbol of unity is found in the mingling of wine and bread, as is the symbol of the androgynous character of Christ (the wine and bread are seen as masculine and feminine, respectively).

Examples of pre-Christian antecedents of the symbol ism of the Christian religious Mass are found in the dream visions of the alchemist Zosimos. Numerous al lusions to sacrificial rite s are found in the visions of the priest Hiereus and the sacr ificer Hierourgon, in which the prie st submits voluntarily to various types of torture, ritual dismemberment (deipnon) , and burning on the altar (thysis). Through these sacrifices the priest is transforme d. Similar sacrificial transformations are noted in the Scythian flaying and scalping rituals, and the custom of head shav ing among ancient and contem porary religious sects; the shaving of the head is associated with a return to the newborn state, a rebirth into purity. Throughout the vision it is observed that sacrificer and sacrificed are identical; this unity is one of the basic themes of alchemical thought, and is found symbolized in differ ent ways in different alch emical traditions. This symbolic division, transformation and reunion of a new and more perfect substance are found in the sacrificial sword of alchemical a nd Christian tradition which both kill s and brings to life, and in the dismemberment and decapitation formulae of ancient pagan ritual. The decapitated head as oracle (transformation into highe r knowledge) appears in Greek as well as ancient pagan and modern Bantu symbolism. The unconscious origin of these dream vi sions and of alchemical and religious symbolic structure in general is stressed. However, in anci ent times the idea of an unconscious psychic process had not yet been formulated; the visions were consid ered by ancient theorists to spring from natural forces and spirits outside of them rather from their own psyches. It is only in man's recent history that science has demystified nature, compelling men to l ook into themselves for the origins of universal symbols. 2 references. 000377 Transformation symbolism in the Mass. 4. The psychology of the Mass. I. General remarks on the sacrifice. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 247-252). The psychological and the metaphysical or religious interpretations of the Roman Mass are discussed and compared. It is the view of the Church that human consciousness, represented by the priest and congregation, is confronted in the Mass with an aut onomous force that transcends and transforms it. The p sychological view of the Mass as the psyche's sym bolic self-transformation through an acting-out of unconscious drives on the conscious level is seen as complementary rather than contradictory to Christian dogma. The mystery of transubstantiation is considered no less miracu lous for being human as well as divine. The belief in the dual nature of G od and the God-man, well subs tantiated in Scripture and Christian tradition, itself supports this dual inter-pretation of the Mass. 000378 Transformation symbolism in the Mass . 4.

Through the sacrifice in the Mass Chri st is eternally redeemed and ma n can reach salvation. In the Mass the sacrifical offering is bread a nd wine, symbolizing male and female , spiritual and earthly elements. As the raw substances of grain and grapes are tran sformed by special processes into bread and wine, so too are the participants in the Mass refined and tran sformed by its ritual. It is in identifying a person's p roperty as a projection of himself that the giving of a gift (a sacrifice) is giving of part of that person. Thus in sacrificing an object one sacrifices oneself . This act of giving part of oneself reflects the knowledge that one does have some control and unde rstanding of the self. Thus by giving up the self one comes to trul y p ossess it.

It is through self-awareness, self- reflection and individuation that all psychic parts are integrated.

The comparison be tween the vision of Zos imos and the Mass seem superficially unrelated, though in the deeper symbolism of the Mass as a sacrifice they are very similar. The basic difference in the two is that Zosimos t ook his vision literally rather than symbolically. 000379 Transformation s y mbolism in the Mass. 4. The ps y cbolo gy of the Mass. 111. The Mass and the individuation process. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 273-296). Manifestations are found in Christia n literature and tradition of Christ as the total man symbolizing the total personality, or the self. The round dance allude d to in the Acts of John is an example of the symbolic individuation proce ss seen in the Mass. It is through the circle in the round dance that the relationship in nature of the parts to the whole is symbolized. Here the world is not an antithetical dichotomy of good and evil, but is much more appropriately understood as conscious trying to comprehend unconscious. The circle ag ain is in the form of mandala, th e center symbolizing the idea of totality and finality. In the hymn that accompanies th e dance the dual nature of Christ is revealed in a series of paradoxes; each paradox is e xplicated as a symbol of Christ's role as man and God, and of the ideal reunion between the two. The nature of the cross as instrument of torture and as divine symbol further support this identity/duality. The cross is the center, but it also repres ents division; it is a counterpart of the mandala symbolizi ng the division of the world into a polarity of right and left. The cross is one of the prime symbols of order where opposing sides meet and a third force is found. This force has the nature of both of the opposing sides but is itself free of opposition. In like manner the unconscious contains both th e nature of unity and multiplicity at once; without the psyche man could not establish the existence of the world, let alone know it . It is through selfhood that man finds relief from the chaotic conditions in the world. The tremendou s polarities in man can only be overcome by the terrifying psychic process of understanding the uncons cious, an act whereof man is the object and the subject. It is the act of becoming aware of the unc onscious and the preconscious that is symbolized in the Mass by the crucifixion a nd redemption. 1 reference. 000380 Foreword to White's \"God and the unconscious.\" In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton Univ ersity Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 299-310). In the foreword to White's work, \"God and the Unc onscious,\" the relationship between the theological and the psychological concern for sick and suffering human beings is analyzed with emphasis on the need for cooperation and understanding between the two approaches. That an idea is not liked and that its implications falsify some basic idea underlying so ciety is not considered to negate the idea; nor should the discoverer be criticized for the content of the discovery. The archetype privatio bom does not give man the choice between good and evil, instea d the evil works upon man without his permission, making him the object of the deed rather than the subjec t. White is seen as a theologian seeking to define God in terms of empirical fact. Th is procedure is one of the tenets of therapy: examination of the spiritual side of the patient is reco mmended as a means of cure. It is al so suggested that each patient be treated individually, as many have the spiritual maturity of the early Christians or primitives and their cures will be found in those terms. 000381 Foreword to Werblowsky's \"Lucifer and Prometheus.\" In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C.

Satan first emerged as the shadow, the symbol of the opposite of good; the Catholic Chur ch made him the left ha nd of God and the first Son; in medieval times the Cathars be lieved Satan to be the creator of all things; and in modern times he is seen as a personification of all that is evil. It is a psychological rule that when an archetype such as Satan has lost its metaphysical hypostasis it becomes operative in the conscious mind of the individual. As it still contains some numinosity, it generally pr oduces an inflation of the subject leading to moral irresponsibility. 000382 Brother Klaus. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. If. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 316-323). The visions of Brother Klaus, recorded by Father Stoeckli, Heinrich, Wolffi n and Karl Bouithis, are analyzed as examples of a genuine primordial ex perience expressed in an archetypal symbol. Brother Klaus, a l5th century Swiss hermit, renounced his famil y and withdrew into solit ude as a result of the overpowering force of his visions which he interpreted to be a re presentation of God himself, the Absolute Good. The predominance of light in both the adult vision of the Trinity and in the vision of a star that Brother Klaus believed to have had whil e he was still in his mother's womb are taken as indications of an irrupti ng illumination, a primordial religious e xperience of God that can neither be assimilated nor denied. The whirl symbol used by Brot her Klaus to elucidate his vision is interpreted as a mandala symbol, whereas his vision of the woman is considered to be a re flection of the androgynous nature of mystic experience and a parallel to the Tantric philosophy of Shiva and Shakti. 000383 Psychotherapists or the clergy. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 327-347). A brief overview of the development of theories of neurosis is provided and the relationship between p sychotherapeutic treatment and man's spiritual suff ering is examined. Freudi an, Adlerian and purely neurological theories of neurosis are rejected in favor of the view that psychoneurosis must be understood as the suffering of a soul that has not yet discovered its meaning. By defining neurosis in these terms, the religious nature of the problem b ecomes apparent. The inability of the clergy to deal with the psychological dimensions of the suffering person is analyzed as in modem man's unwillingness to seek help from the clergy. Thus it is the doctor who is confronted with the questions concerning ultimate meaning -questions formerly answered by theologians and philosophers. In order to liberate the sufferer from the interior conflict he is experiencing, the doctor is urge d to recognize that he is dealing with the fundamental problem of good and evil. To d eal effectively with this problem certain basic attitudes are require d: unprejudiced objectivity, a willingness to allow the patient to experience his capacity for evil, a recognition of his own shadows on the part of the doctor. Healing is defined as a reconciliation of the conflicting forces and the pati ent's egoism; a symptom of neurosis is viewed as useful in allowing the neur otic to experience his ow n loneliness and isolation. When the archetypes of the unconscious are awakened and take over the guidan ce of the psychic personality, replacing the futile striving and will of the ego, the cure begins. In reli gious terms, the patient ma y describe the experience as guidance from God; in psychothe rapeutic language, it may be described as the psyche's awakening to its own spontaneous activity. It is c oncluded that the cure involves a tr ue, primordial experience of the spirit. 000384 Psychoanalysis and the cure of souls. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 348-354). The approaches to the cure of s ouls employed by Catholic and Protes tant clergy are examined and and compared to the work of the psychoanalyst. It is th e job of the psychoanalyst to lay bare the unconscious and integrate it with the conscious mind, while the clergyman's cure is based on the Christian confession of faith. The methods of Adler and Freud are anal y zed in the li g ht of their usefulness in the p astoral cure"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"of souls and rejected as inadequate. Rather than to treat the conscious mind, Freudian psychoanalysis seeks to lead the contents of the unconscious over into the conscious mind, whereas Adlerian p edagogics are seen to aim at th e normalization and ad aptation of the individual, neglecting the unconscious. The advantages of the Catholic c onfession as a means of understanding unconscious control are pointed out. The Protesta nt minister, not having the confessi onal, has turned to analytical p sychology: the cure of souls, through the soul of the minister working on the soul of the troubled p erson. Objections to this analytical method are ra ised much faster than to the confessional method because the former is more formalized and dogmatic . Further, the Protestant minister, who lacks the ritual forms for channelling clients' psychic conflict s, runs a greater risk of personal involvement in these conflicts, to the detriment of his professional and family situat ion. However, the intimate contact with the world this curing of souls provides is seen as a challenge and an adventure as well as a danger for the Protestant minister. 000385 Answer to Job. Prefatory note. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 355-358). In the preface of \"Answer to Job,\" the sources and moti ves that fashioned this wo rk are stated. It is, in p art, an answer to the problems raised by the Christ /Antichrist antagonism found in the \"Aion\" as well as a examination of the religious question concerning th e origin of evil. The aim of this book is to trace historically the evolution of the idea that God is a consortium of opposites from the time of Job through the centunes to its most recent symbol ic manifestations. The wo rk itself is not a de finitive statement of eternal truth but rather an expr ession of the questions of a si ngle individual, based on personal experience and subjective emotions. 000386 Answer to Job. Lectori benevolo. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Pr ess, 1969. 699 p. (p. 359-363). The \"physical\" as the only criterion of truth is compar ed with \"psychic\" truths. That which we consider real in physical terms ignores th e half of the world that is ps ychically real. The archetypes found throughout history are part of our unconscious and are unknowable in a physical sense; rather they are founded in psychic fact. These psychic facts are not constructed by deduction; instead they enter the conscious as complete thoughts in the fo rm of symbols from the unconscious. 000387 Answer to Job. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 365-470). The representation of the god Yahweh in the Book of Job is examined in terms of the amorality of Yahweh's dealings with humanity. In this text Yahweh appears as much more human than divine; he is unjust, selfish, irrational, and capable of much less mo ral consciousness than Job. The fact that Job asks God to defend against God himself is taken as a sy mbol of the dual nature of God as protector and p ersecutor, as good and evil simultaneously. The char acter of God is clearly an antinomy, a unity of opposites, and it is from this inne r conflict that the dynamism, the omniscience and the omnipotence of God are seen to derive. This view of God is seen as a reflection of the real ization on the part of the author of the Book of Job in particular, and of metaphys ical theorists in general, that the concept of God is a relative one, dependent not upon facts but upon inte rpretations. However, this suspicion did not lead to the devaluation of the God figure until the m odern age, when the dual nature of God and its implication for the mind of man is being seriously an alyzed. The state of reli gious thought and tradition at the time of the writing of the B ook of Job is examined in terms of the dual nature of God. The figure of Sophia, a feminine force coeterna l with God, is seen as a derivation of Greek symbolic tradition and a p arallel of Indian mythology; she is the gentle and wise counterpart to the ruthlessness of Yahweh. The assimilation of So p hia and Yahweh is observed to take p lace at the moment when man's rationalit y and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"sense of justice had matured beyond the point of accepting an unjust God. A further humanization of God is His coming to earth in the form of man, pr efigured in the Cain and Abel story where the one p leasing to God's eye is slain. Th e Son of God is seen as a quality desired by both man and God. The inclusion of the feminine with the masculine as a part of the concept of God unites conflicting entities; a similar unification is seen in the awareness of the unconscious by the conscious through symbols. It is through an analysis of his unconsci ous that man becomes aware of the God archetype. God is not identified with the unconscious; ra ther it is an archetypal image th at arises from the unconscious and aids in man's search for wholeness. 2 references. 000388 Psychological commentary on \"The Tibeta n Book of the Great Liberation.\" 1. The difference between Eastern and Western thinking. In: Jung, C., Collected works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 475-493). A comparison is made between Eastern and Western views of psychic reality in a psychological interpretation of the \"Tibetan Book of the Great Libe ration.\" The former is considered to be basically introverted; the latter, extraverted. In his objective attitude towards experience Western man finds meaning in his everyday world and his life. Western man bombards himself with facts, the meaning of which is unintelligible, yet it is through the ac cumulation of countless facts that he hopes to find meaning. He then looks outward to Christianity fo r meaning and purpose. The psyche is considered by modem man as an untrustworthy part of the mind that must be suppressed as completely as possible. Partial expressions of his incompletely suppressed psyche are perceived by th e ego centered Western man as sinful. Eastern man finds his religion in his subjectivity. He looks in ward and becomes totally aware of his unconscious, and thus of his successe s and failings. In so doing the conscious becomes identical with the unconscious, and every unconsci ous thought can be controlled. Both Eastern and Western religions fail by refusing to take the other's facts as eviden ce; psychic events, which are not considered facts by Western man, cons titute the basic facts of existenc e for Eastern man. 1 reference. 000389 Psychological commentary on \"The Tibetan B ook of the Great Liberation.\" 2. Comments on the text. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 494-508). A commentary on the text of \"The Tibetan Book of th e Great Liberation\" is pr ovided in order to show the parallels between Eastern me taphysical thought and the disc overies of modem psychology. The universal mind of Tibetan lore and the collective uncons cious are seen as the same; they are the root of the experience of validity oneness, the interrelation of all archetypes, and the validity of the phenomenal world. Here gods exist as thought forms, as the one and the opposite, yin and yang. By exploring the unconscious, man finds oneness, indefiniteness, a nd timelessness. Knowledge of the One Mind is necessary in order to know one's self and to compen sate for a onesided adjustment to the world. Man cannot compel unconscious compensation for his onesi dedness; instead he must wait for it with a comtemplative attitude that is in itself healing. The transcendental \"At-one -ment\" is attained by withdrawing into the undi fferentiated unconscious wh ere nothing is distinct enough to cause conflict. It is felt that Western man must ca refully explore his unconscious befo re attempting to experience the subjectivity of Eastern religions; it will do him little good to attempt yoga if he is unconsciously a medieval Christian. He must be able to put aside hi s history to accept this introspective Eastern outlook, p art of which involves existing and not exis ting at the same time. 1 reference. 000390 Psychological commentary on \"T he Tibetan Book of the Dead.\" In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C.

It is through the Bardo Thodol in \"T he Tibetan Book of the Dead\" that the dead are guided through the 49 days' transition. The instant of death is the highest , most glorious moment; it is from this point that the soul descends until it reach es physical rebir-th 49 days later. At the moment of death one is part of the mind of Buddha; this state is called Chikhai, of which a major symbol is the mandala with Buddha in the middle. The second stat e is the Chonyid, or the Bardo of the experiencing of reality. It is in this state that man finds out wh at is good and evil, precious and worthless, subject and object, and that the ego is sacrificed and the soul ente rs a form of psychosis and torment. The third state is Sidpa, or the Bardo of seeking rebirth. In this state sexual fantasies occur, and the soul is drawn toward mating couples until it focuses on one and is dr awn toward rebirth in that couple. It is possible for the soul to reach the Dharmakaya by transce nding the four face Mount Meru, providing it does not follow its reason and dim the guiding lights. Th ere is no similar symbolism in the West, only Catholicism has named a place for souls to go after de ath; for this reason Freud could not have patients regress back farther than the intrauterine stage. 000391 Yoga and the West. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 529-537). In a comparative study on Eastern and Western mental ity, the basic duality of th e Western mind is seen to negate the value of yoga. Western man has divided his world into two distinct natures, the scientific and the religious; the two are separa te entities, but neither makes any sense without the other. Western man divested yoga of its religious implications, making it just another system to be followed -- for p hysical rather than psychic hygiene. Western man do es not have the same history as Eastern man, and the implications of these differing histories have not carried over in the use of yoga, in that western man cannot understand the concept of prana and ther efore cannot unite the psychological with the p hysiological. 000392 Foreword to Suzuki's \"Intro duction to Zen Buddhism.\" In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton Univer sity Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 538-557). The satori, the original religious e xperience of the East, is described as a natural occurrence that cannot be comm unicated verbally. It is thr ough the enlightenment of satori that man sees the nature of the self and frees himself from its illusions . Having once had this experience, man can begin to see things in terms of nonego. He does not see new ideas or things; instead, he sees them differently. Satori is found through the Koan, an ambiguous question with no form ulated answer; it is through studying the many koans that the answer breaks through. The answer is not formulated by the conscious mind, but is found in nature and in the unconscious. This belief, the sato ri experience, is similar to that of Western thought in terms of the transformation of unconscious proce sses into conscious thought. This also means that man is not born in a state of tabul a rasa, but with preconscious or i nnate ideas. In man's search for wholeness he bursts through to his unconscious, th e recognition of which enables him to comprehend the uncomprehensible unconscious. In the modern West, it is the psychotherapi st who smooths the path for those seeking wholeness. 2 references. 000393 The psychology of Eastern meditation. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G.

The Indian religious practice of yoga is examined as an expression of th e Indian view of the mind and as an instrument for attaining a certain state of being with at tention given to the sub tle differences between Indians and Western mandala symbols. Buddhism aros e from yoga, a form of meditation, which existed long before Buddha, who merely followed the path of meditation. Certain medita tions are listed through which Indians find themselves in Buddha; the medi tations begin with looking at the setting sun, a circular s y mbol of life, God, and unit y , a s y mbol found in both Western and Eastern cultures.

It is at the point of solidification that Western man cannot follow the sym bolism any longer; it is here that the unconscious b ecomes real and concrete, and mo re importantly, known by the consci ous. Western man finds his peace in rising above the unconscious, while Eastern man de lves into the unconscious to find enlightenment. Western man cannot reach beyond his personal unconscious to th e collective unconscious and his enlightenment. In Eastern culture B uddha is found in man, whereas in the West, man is found in Christ. Even though the West cannot find enlightenment in Eastern meditation, the symbolism behind both religions is seen to be the same. It is here that the collective unconscious is seen in the archetypal symbols. 000394 The holy men of India. In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 576-586). The thought of the Indian holy man, Sh ri Romana and Rama Krishna, is examined as an expression of the conflict between ego and self. The Indian probl em of self and ego parallels the Western man's God/man dichotomy. The Indian pr oblem appears merely psychological in comparison to the Western metaphysical problem. Yet the goal of bot h is to shift the center of being from the ego or man to the self or God. For the Indian this is accomplished by subm erging the ego in the self, and for Western man, the submerging of his self in God. Th e goal of psychic deve lopment is for the self to encompass the conscious and unconscious, a goal attain able in Indian culture. But this idea is seen to be threatened in India because of the westernization that comes with statehood. It is fe lt that Western man's ways of concerning himself with only the conscious and not the unconscious will take its toll spiritually in India. 1 reference. 000395 Foreword to the \"I-Ching.\" In: Jung, C., Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. 11. 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1969. 699 p. (p. 589-608). In the foreword to the English edition of the \"I-C hing\" (Book of Changes), a demonstration of how the I-Ching functions in the Chinese mind is presente d instead of a psychological commentary on the whole book. The goal of this demons tration is to help the reader to fo rm a tentative judgment on the operation of the I-Ching. In order to understand the use of the I-Ching, it is considered important to distinguish between the Chinese synchronistic approach to ev ents and the Western causal approach: the former interprets events in terms of coincidence and ch ance. Consequently the 64 hexagrams of the IChing indicate the essential situation that prevailed at the moment of the origin of each hexagram. These hexagrams, in turn, are the instruments by which 64 di fferent yet typical situat ions can be determined. Two experiments are descri bed which illustrate the workings of the I-Ching. The book was personified; i.e.,considered as a speaking subject, and certain quest ions were addressed to it. In keeping with Chinese tradition ' three coins were tossed and the pattern that they formed was used as a guide to the hexameters to be consulted. An analysis of the hexameters is provided and the methods used in interpreting their significance are discussed with a ttention given to the importance of lines designated by the numbers 6 and 9. It is concluded from this experiment that the I-Ching, as if speaking for itself, faced its future on the American book market calmly and optimisticall y. A second experiment is described that demonstrates how the I-Ching can elucidate the s ubjective attitude of th e user. Although it is acknowledged that the Western mind has great diff iculty in accepting the psychological phenomcnology of the I-Ching, the discussions and prophecies of this work are felt to have a wisdom and knowledge that can be attributed to more than chance.
