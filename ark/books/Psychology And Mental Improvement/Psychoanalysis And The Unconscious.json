MORALITY PSYCHOANALYSIS has sprung many -*- surprises on us, performed more than one volte- face before our indignant eyes. No sooner had we got used to the psychi- atric quack who vehemently demonstrated the serpent of sex coiled round the root of all our actions, no sooner had we begun to feel honestly uneasy about our lurking complexes, than lo and behold the psycho- analytic gentleman reappeared on the stage with a theory of pure psychology.

The ears of the ethnologist began to tingle, the philosopher felt his gorge rise, and at last the moralist knew he must rush in. By this time psychoanalysis had be- come a public danger. The mob was on the alert. The (Edipus complex was a household word, the incest motive a commonplace of tea-table chat. Amateur analyses became the vogue. \" Wait till you've been analysed,\" said one man to another, with varying intonation. A sinister look came into the eyes of the initiates the famous, or infamous, Freud look. You could recognize it everywhere, wherever you went. Psychoanalysts know what the end will be.

First and foremost, the moral issue. And next, but more vital, he can't get down to the rock on which he must build his church. Let us look to ourselves. This new doctrine it will be called no less has been subtly and insidiously suggested to us, gradually inoculated into us.

But it all amounts to the same thing. Psychoanalysis is out, under a therapeutic disguise, to do away entirely with the moral faculty in man. Let us fling the challenge, and then we can take sides in all fairness. The psychoanalytic leaders know what they are about, and shrewdly keep quiet, going gently. Yet, however gently they go, they set the moral stones rolling. At every step the most innocent and unsus- pecting analyst starts a little landslide. The old world is yielding under us.

If we are to rea'r a serpent against ourselves, let us at least refuse to nurse it in our temples or to call it the cock of ^Esculapius. It is time the white garb of the therapeutic cant was stripped off the psychoanalyst. And now that we feel the strange crackling and convulsion in our moral foundations, let us at least look at the house which we are bringing down over our heads so blithely. Long ago we watched in frightened anticipation when Freud set out on his adventure into the hinterland of human consciousness. He was seeking for the unknown sources of the mysterious stream of consciousness. Immortal phrase of the 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS immortal James ! Oh stream of hell which undermined my adolescence ! The stream of consciousness ! I felt it stream- ing through my brain, in at one ear and out at the other. And again I was sure it went round in my cranium, like Homer's Ocean, encircling my established mind. And sometimes I felt it must bubble up in the cerebellum and wind its way through all the convolutions of the true brain. Horrid stream ! Whence did it come, and whither was it bound ? The stream of consciousness ! And so, who could remain unmoved when Freud seemed suddenly to plunge towards the origins ? Suddenly he stepped out of the conscious into the unconscious, out of the everywhere into the nowhere, like some supreme explorer. He walks straight through the wall of sleep, and 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS VS. MORALITY we hear him rumbling in the cavern of dreams. The impenetrable is not im- penetrable, unconsciousness is not nothing- ness. It is sleep, that wall of darkness which limits our day. Walk bang into the wall, and behold the wall isn't there. It is the vast darkness of a cavern's mouth, the cavern of anterior darkness whence issues the stream of consciousness. With dilated hearts we watched Freud disappearing into the cavern of darkness, which is sleep and unconsciousness to us, darkness which issues in the foam of all our day's consciousness. He was making for the origins. We watched his ideal candle flutter and go small. Then we waited, as men do wait, always expecting the wonder of wonders. He came back with dreams to sell. But sweet heaven, what merchandise ! 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS What dreams, dear heart ! What was there in the cave ? Alas that we ever looked ! v JNothing_but^a hygc__slimy ser- pent of sex, and heaps of excrement, and a myriad repulsive little horrors spawned^ between sex and excrement. Is it true ? Does the great unknown of sleep contain nothing else ? No lovely spirits in the anterior regions of our being ? None ! Imagine the unspeak- able horror of the repressions Freud brought home to us. Gagged, bound, maniacal repressions, sexual complexes, faecal inhi- bitions, dream-monsters. We tried to repudiate them. But no, they were there, demonstrable. These were the horrid things that ate our souls and caused our helpless neuroses. We had felt that perhaps we were wrong inside, but we had never imagined 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS VS. MORALITY it so bad. However, in the name of healing and medicine we prepared to accept it all. If it was all just a result of illness, we were prepared to go through with it. The analyst ' promised us that the tangle of complexes would be un- ravelled, the obsessions would evaporate, the monstrosities would dissolve, subli- mate, when brought into the light of day. Once all the dream-horrors were translated into full consciousness, they would subli- mate into well, we don't quite know what. But anyhow, they would sublimate. Such is the charm of a new phrase that we accepted this sublimation process with- out further question. If our complexes were going to sublimate once they were surgically exposed to full mental conscious- ness, why, best perform the operation. Thus analysis set off gaily on its thera- 17 B"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS peutic course. But like Hippolytus, we ran too near the sea's edge. After all, if complexes exist only as abnormalities which can be removed, psychoanalysis has not far to go. Our own horses ran away with us. We began to realize that complexes were not just abnormalities. They were part of the stock-in-trade of the normal unconscious. The only ab- normality, so far, lies in bringing them into consciousness. This creates a new issue. Psychoanal- ysis, the moment it begins to demonstrate the nature of the unconscious, is assuming the role of psychology. Thus the niew science of psychology proceeds to inform us that our complexes are not just mere interlockings in the mechanism of the psyche, as was taught by one of the first and most brilliant of the analysts, a maji 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS VS. MORALITY now forgotten. He fully realized that even the psyche itself depends on a certain organic, mechanistic activity, even as life depends on the mechanistic organism of the body. The mechanism of the psyche could have its hitches, certain parts could stop working, even as the parts of the body can stop their functioning. This arrest in some part of the functioning psyche gave rise to a complex, even as the stopping of one little cog-wheel in a machine will arrest a whole section of that machine. This was the origin of the complex-theory, purely mechanistic. Now the analyst found that a complex did not necessarily vanish when brought into consciousness. Why should it ? Hence he decided that it did not arise from the stoppage of any little wheel. For it refused to disappear, no matter how many 10"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS psychic wheels were started. Finally, then, a complex could not be regarded as the result of an inhibition. Here is the new problem. If a complex is not caused by the inhibition of some so-called normal sex-impulse, what on earth is it caused by ? It obviously refuses to sublimate or to come undone when exposed and prodded. It refuses to answer to the promptings of normal sex-impulse. You can remove all possible inhibitions of the normal sex desire, and still you cannot remove the complex. All you have done is to make conscious a desire which previously was unconscious. This is the moral dilemma of psycho- analysis. The analyst set out to cure neurotic humanity by removing the cause of the neurosis. He finds that the cause of neurosis lies in some unadmitted 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS VS. MORALITY desire. After all he has said about inhi- bition of normal sex, he is brought at last to realize that at the root of almost every neurosis lies some incest-craving, and that this incest-craving is not the result of inhibition of normal sex-craving. Now see the dilemma it is a fearful one. If the incest-craving is not the outcome of any inhibition of normal desire, if it actually exists and refuses to give way before any criticism, what then ? What remains but to accept it as part of the normal sex-manifestation ? Here is an issue which analysis is perfectly willing to face. Among them- selves the analysts are bound to accept the incest-craving as part of the normal sexuality of man, normal, but suppressed, because of moral and perhaps biological fear. Once, however, you accept the 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS incest-craving as part of the normal sexual- ity of man, you must remove all repression of incest itself. In fact, you must admit incest as you now admit sexual marriage, as a duty even. Since at last it works out that neurosis is not the result of inhibition of so-called normdl sex, but of inhibition of incest-craving. Any inhibi- tion must be wrong, since inevitably in the end it causes neurosis and insanity. Therefore the inhibition of incest-craving is wrong, and this wrong is the cause of practically all modern neurosis and insanity. Psychoanalysis will never openly state this conclusion. But it is to this conclusion that every analyst must, willy-nilly, con- sciously or unconsciously, bring his patient. Trigant Burrow says that Freud's uncon- scious does but represent our conception of conscious sexual life as this latter exist? 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS VS. MORALITY in a state of repression. Thus Freud's unconscious amounts practically to no more than our repressed incest impulses. Again, Burrow says that it is knowledge of sex tljat constitutes sin, and not sex itself. v lt is when the mind turns to consider and know the great affective- passional functions and emotions that sin enters. Adam and Eve fell, not because they had sex, or even because they com- mitted the sexual act, but because they became aware of their, sex and of the possibility of the act. , When sex became to them a mental object that is, when they discovered that they could deliber- ately enter upon and enjoy and even provoke sexual activity in themselves, then they were cursed and cast out of Eden. Then man became self-responsible ; he^ entered on his own career. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS Both these assertions by Burrow seem to us brilliantly true. But must we inevitably draw the conclusion psycho- analysis draws ? Because we discover in the unconscious the repressed body of our incest-craving, and because the recogni- tion of desire, the making a mental objec- tive of a certain desire causes the intro- duction of the sin motive, the desire in itself being beyond criticism or moral judgment, must we therefore accept the incest-craving as part of our natural desire and proceed to put it into practice, as being at any rate a lesser evil than neurosis and insanity ? It is a question. One thing, however, psychoanalysis all along the line fails to determine, and that is y the nature of the pristine unconscious in man, The incest- craving is or is not inherent in the pristine 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS VS. MORALITY psyche. When Adam and Eve became aware of sex in themselves, they became aware of that which was pristine in them, and which preceded all knowing. But when the analyst discovers the incest motive in the unconscious, surely he is only discovering a term of humanity's repressed idea of sex. It is not even suppressed sex-consciousness, but repressed. That is, it is nothing pristine and anterior to mentality. It is in itself the mind's ulterior motive. That is, the incest- craving is propagated in the pristine unconscious by the mind itself, even though unconsciously. The mind acts as incubus and procreator of its own horrors, deliberately unconsciously. And the incest motive is in its origin not a pristine impulse, but a logical extension of the existent idea of sex and love. The 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS mind, that is, transfers the idea of incest into the affective-passional psyche, and keeps it there as a repressed motive. This is as yet a mere assertion. It cannot be made good until we determine the nature of the true, pristine unconscious, in which all our genuine impulse arises a very different affair from that sack of horrors which psychoanalysts would have us believe is source of motivity. The Freudian unconscious is the cellar in which the mind keeps its own bastard spawn. N/The true unconscious is the well- head, the fountain of real motivity. The sex of which Adam and Eve became conscious derived from the very God who bade them be not conscious of it it was not spawn produced by secondary propa- gation from the mental consciousness itself^ 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"i CHAPTER II THE INCEST MOTIVE AND IDEALISM T is obvious we cannot recover our moral footing until we can in some way determine the true nature of the unconsciou^. The word unconscious itself is a mere definition by negation and has no positive meaning. Freud no doubt prefers it for this reason. He rejects subconscious and preconscious, because both these would imply a sort of nascent consciousness, the shadowy half-conscious- ness which precedes mental realization. And by his unconscious he intends no such thing. He wishes rather to convey, we imagine, that which recoils from con- sciousness, that which reacts in the psyche away from mental consciousness. His 2T"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS unconscious is, we take it, that part of the human consciousness which, though mental, ideal in its nature, yet is unwilling to expose itself to full recognition, and so recoils back into the affective regions and acts there as a secret agent, uncon- fessed, unadmitted, potent, and usually destructive. The whole body of our re- pressions makes up our unconscious. The question lies here : whether a repression is a primal impulse which has been deterred from fulfilment, or whether it is an idea which is refused enactment. Is a repression a repressed passional im- pulse, or is it an idea which we suppress and refuse to put into practice nay, which we even refuse to own at all, a disowned, outlawed idea, which exists rebelliously outside the pale ? Man can inhibit the true passional 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE INCEST MOTIVE AND IDEALISM impulses and so produce a derangement in the psyche. This is a truism nowadays, and we are grateful to psychoanalysis for helping to make it so. But man can do more than this. Finding himself in a sort of emotional cul-de-sac, he can proceed to deduce from his given emotional and passional premises conclusions which are not emotional or passional at all, but just logical, abstract, ideal. That is, a man finds it impossible to realize himself in marriage. He recognizes the fact that his emotional, even passional, regard for his mother is deeper than it ever could be for a wife. This makes him unhappy, for he knows that passional communion is not complete unless it be also sexual. He has a body of sexual passion which he cannot transfer to a wife. He has a profound love for his mother. Shut in 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS between walls of tortured and increasing passion, he must find some escape or fall down the pit of insanity and death. What is the only possible escape ? To seek in the arms of the mother the refuge which offers nowhere else. And so the incest- motive is born. All the laboured explan- ations of the psychoanalysts are unneces- sary. The incest motive is a logical deduction of the human reason, which has recourse to this last extremity, to save itself. Why is the human reason in peril ? That is another story. At the moment we are merely considering the origin of the incest motive. The logical conclusion of incest is, of course, a profound decision in the human soul, a decision affecting the deepest passional centres. It rouses the deepest in- stinctive opposition. And therefore it must 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE INCEST MOTIVE AND IDEALISM be kept secret until this opposition is either worn away or persuaded away. Hence the repression and ultimate disclosure. Now here we see the secret working of the process of idealism. By idealism we understand the motivizing of the great affective sources by means of ideas men- tally derived. As for example the incest motive, which is first and foremost a logical deduction made by the human reason, even if unconsciously made, and secondly is introduced into the affective, passional sphere, where it now proceeds to serve as a principle for action. This motivizing of the passional sphere from the ideal is the final peril of human consciousness. It is the death of all spon- taneous, creative life, and the substitut- ing of the mechanical principle. It is obvious that the ideal becomes 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS a mechanical principle, if it be applied to the affective soul as a fixed motive. An ideal established in control of the passional soul is no more and no less than a supreme machine-principle. And a machine, as we know, is the active unit of the material world. Thus we see how it is that in the end pure idealism is identical with pure materialism, and the most ideal peoples are the most completely material. Ideal and material are identical. The ideal is but the god in the machine the little, fixed, machine principle which works the human psyche automatically. We are now in the last stages of ideal- ism. And psychoanalysis alone has the courage necessary to conduct us through these last stages. The identity of love with sex, the single necessity for fulfilment through love, these are our fixed ideals. 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE INCEST MOTIVE AND IDEALISM We must fulfil these ideals in their extre- mity. And this brings us finally to incest, even incest-worship. We have no option, whilst our ideals stand. Why ? Because incest is the logical conclusion of our ideals, when these ideals have to be carried into passional effect. And idealism has no escape from logic. And once he has built himself in the shape of any ideal, man will go to any logical length rather than abandon his ideal corpus. Nay, some great cataclysm has to throw him down and destroy the whole fabric of his life before the motor-principle of his dominant ideal is destroyed. Hence psychoanalysis as the advance-guard of science, the evangel of the last ideal liberty. For of course there is a great fascination in a completely effected ideal- ism. Man is then undisputed master of 83 c"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS his own fate, and captain of his own soul. But better say engine-driver, for in truth he is no more than the little god in the machine, this master of fate. He has invented his own automatic principles, and he works himself according to them, like any little mechanic inside the works. But ideal or not, we are all of us between the pit and the pendulum, or the walls of red-hot metal, as may be. If we refuse the Freudian pis-aller as a means of escape, we have still to find some way out. For there we are, all of us, trapped in a corner where we cannot, and simply do not know how to fulfil our own natures, passionally. We don't know in which way fulfilment lies. If psychoanalysis discovers incest, small blame to it. Yet we do know this much : that the pushing of the ideal to .any further lengths 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE INCEST MOTIVE AND IDEALISM will not avail us anything. We have actually to go back to our own uncon- scious. But not to the unconscious which is the inverted reflection of our ideal consciousness. We must discover, if we can, the true unconscious, where our life bubbles up in us, prior to any mentality. The first bubbling life in us, which is innocent of any mental alteration, this is the unconscious. It is pristine, not in any way ideal. It is the spontaneous origin from which it behooves us to live. What then is the true unconscious ? It is not a shadow cast from the mind. It is the spontaneous life-motive in every organism. Where does it begin ? It be- gins where life begins. But that is too vague. It is no use talking about life and the unconscious in bulk.

Any attempt at a further generalization t^kes us merely beyond the consideration of life into the region of mechanical homo- geneous force. This is shown in the cosmologies of eastern religions. The beginning of life is in the beginning of the first individual creature. You may call the naked, unicellular bit of plasm the first individual, if you like. Mentally, as far as thinkable simplicity goes, it is the first. So that we may say that life 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE INCEST MOTIVE AND IDEALISM begins in the first naked unicellular organ- ism. And where life begins the uncon- scious also begins.

The two are inseparable, life and individu- ality. And also, where the individual begins, the unconscious, which is the specific life-motive, also begins. We are trying to trace the unconscious to its source. And we find that this source, in all the higher organisms, is the first ovule cell from which an individual organism arises.

We say created. And by created we mean spontaneously appearing in the universe, out of nothing. Ex nihilo nihil fit. It is true that an individual is also generated. By the fusion of two nuclei, male and female, we understand the process of generation. And from the process of generation we may justly look for a new unit, according to the law of cause and effect.

By the unconscious we wish to indicate that essential unique nature of every individual creature, which is, by its very nature, unanalysable, undefinable, inconceivable.

It is necessary for us to know the unconscious, or we cannot live, just as it is necessary for us to know the sun. But we need not explain the unconscious, any more than we need explain the sun.

This con- sciousness obviously cannot be ideal, can- not be cerebral, since it precedes any vestige of cerebration.

Each individual is vitally dependent on the other, for the life circuit. Let us consider for a moment the kind of consciousness manifested at the two great primary centres. At the solar plexus the new psyche acts in a mode of attractive vitalism, drawing its objective unto itself as by vital magnetism. Here it drinks in, as it were, the contiguous universe, as during the womb-period it drank from the living continuum of the mother. It is darkly self-centred, exultant and positive in its own existence. It is all-in-all to itself, its own great subject. It knows 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSTS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS no objective.

Here the psyche is to itself the All. Blindly self-positive. This is the first mode of consciousness for every living thing fascinating in all young things. The second half of the same mode commences as soon as direct activity sets up in the lumbar ganglion. Then the psyche recoils upon itself, in its first reaction against continuity with the outer universe. It recoils even against its own mode of assimilatory unison.

It is like a swimmer endlessly kicking the water away behind him, with strong legs vividly active from the spinal ganglia. Like a man in a boat pushing off from the shore, it merely thrusts away, in order to ride free, ever more free. It is a purely subjective motion, in the negative direction.

So that the powerful subjectivity of the unconscious, where the self is all-in-all unto itself, active in strong desirous psychic assimilation or in direct repudiation of the contiguous universe ; this first plane of psychic activity, polarized in the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion of each individual but established in a circuit 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER with the corresponding poles of another individual : this is the first scope of life and being for every human individual, and is beyond question.

The pure subjectivity of the first plane of consciousness is no more selfish than the pure objectivity of any other plane. How can it be ?

But immediately fol- lowing the establishment of the circuit of the powerful, subjective, abdominal plane comes the quivering of the whole system into a new degree of consciousness.

We profess no scientific exactitude, 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS particularly in terminology. We merely wish intelligibly to open a way. To balance the solar plexus wakes the great plexus of the breast. In our era this plexus is the great planet of our psychic universe. In the previous sym- pathetic era the flower of the universal blossomed jnjjie navel. But since Egypt the sun of creative activity beams from the breast, the heart of the supreme Man. This is to us the source of light the loving heart/ the Sacred Heart. Against this we contrast the devoviring darkness of the lower man, the devouring whirlpool beneath the navel.

For the roots of vision are in the cardiac plexus. But if we were to con- sider the heart itself, not its great nerve plexus, we should have to go further than the nervous system. If we had to consider the whole lambent blood-stream, we should have to descend too deep for our unpractised minds. Suffice it here to hint that the solar plexus is the first and main clue to the great alimentary-sexual activity in man, an activity at once functional and creatively emotional, whilst the cardiac plexus is first and main clue to the respiratory system and the active- productive manifestations.

The duality goes so far and is so profound. And the polarity ! The great organs, as well as the lymphatic glands, depend each on its own specific centre of the unconscious ; each is derived from a specific dynamic conscious-clue, what we might almost call a soul-cell. The inherent unconscious, or soul, is the first nucleus subdivided, and from its own subdivisions produced, from its own still-creative con- stellated nuclei, the organs, glands, nerve- centres of the human organism. This is our answer to materialism and idealism alike. The nuclear unconscious brought forth organs and consciousness alike. And the great nuclei of the unconscious still lie active in the great living nerve-centres, 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE LOVER AND THE BELOVED which nerve centres, from the original solar-plexus to the conclusive brain, form one great chain of dual polarity and amplified consciousness. All this is a mere incoherent stammer- ing, broken first-words. To return to the direct path of our progress. It is not merely a metaphor, to call the cardiac plexus the sun, the Light. It is metaphor in the first place, because the conscious effluence which proceeds from this first upper centre in the breast goes forth and plays upon its external object, as phos- phorescent waves might break upon a ship and reveal its form. The transferring of the objective knowledge to the psyche is almost the same as vision. It is root- vision. It happens before the eyes open.

Psychi- cally, it is basic objective apprehension. Dynamically, it is love, devotional, admin- istering love. Now we make already a discrimination between the two natures, even of this first upper consciousness. First from the breast flows the devotional, self-outpouring of love, love which gives its all to the beloved. And back again returns to the ingathered objective consciousness, the fir^t objective content of the psyche. This argues the dual polarity. From the positive pole of the cardiac plexus flows out that effluence which we call selfless love., It is really self-devoting love, not self-less. This is the one form of love we recognize.

Let us discriminate between the two upper poles. From the sympathetic heart goes forth pure administering, like sun- beams. But from the strong thoracic centre of the shoulders is exerted a strong rejective force, a force which, pressing upon the object of attention, in the mode of separation, succeeds in transferring to itself the impression of the object to which it has attended. This is the other half of devotional love perfect knowledge of the beloved. Now this knowledge in itself argues a contradistinction between the lover and the beloved.

Objective knowledge is always of this kind a knowledge based on unchangeable difference, a knowledge truly of the gulf that lies between the two beings nearest to each other. In two kinds, then, consists the activity of the unconscious on the first upper plane. Primal is the blissful sense of ineffable transfusion with the beloved, which we call love, and of which our era has perhaps enjoyed the full. It is a mode of creative consciousness essentially objective, but yet it preserves no object in the memory, even the dynamic memory. It is a great objective flux, a streaming forth of the self in blissful departure, like sunbeams streaming.

Real objective knowledge. /It goes to find out the wonders which itself does not contain, and to transfer these wonders, as by impress, into itself. It goes out to deter- mine the limits of its own existence also. This is the second half of the activity of upper or self-less or spiritual love.

It seems almost a cruel objectivity. Perhaps between lovers, in the objective way of love, either the voluntary separa- tive mode predominates, or the sympathe- tic mode of communion one or the other.

And all the time the working of each organ depends on the primary spontaneous- conscious centre of which it is the issue if you like, the soul-centre. And con- sciousness is like a web woven finally in the mind from the various silken strands spun forth from the primal centre of the unconscious.

We trace its source and centres in the great ganglia and nodes of the nervous system.

And from this we know the motion and individual manifestation of the psyche itself; we also know the motion and rhythm of the great organs of the body. For at every point psyche and functions are so nearly identified that only by holding our breath can we realize their duality in identification a polarized duality once more.

But the polarity is further. The hori- zontal division of the diaphragm divi4es man for ever into his individual duality, the duality of the upper and lower man, the two great bodies of upper and lower consciousness and function.

Devel- opment takes place only from the polar- ized circuits of the dynamic unconscious, and these circuits must be both individual and extra-individual. There must be the circuit of which the complementary pole is external to the individual. That is, in the first place there must be the other individual. There must be a polarized connection with the other indivi- dual or even other individuals. On the first field there are four poles in each individual.

So we are again face to face with the basic problem of human conduct. No human being can develop save through the polarized connection with other beings. This circuit of polarized unison precedes all mind and all knowing. It is anterior to and ascendant over the human will.

It is thrown off from life, as leaves are shed from a tree, or as feathers fall from a bird. Ideas are the dry, unliving, insentient plumage which inter- venes between us and the circumambient universe, forming at once an insulator and an instrument for the subduing of the universe.

It is exactly what happens. Mentality, being automatic in its principle like the machine, begins to assume life. It begins to affect life, to pretend to make and unmake life. \" In the beginning was the Word.\" This is the presumptuous masquerading of the mind. The Word cannot be the beginning of life. It is the end of life, that which falls shed. The mind is the dead end of life. But it has all the mechanical force of the non-vital universe. It is a great dynamo of super-mechanical force.

And the t human will assists in this humiliating and sterilizing process. We don't know what the human will is. But we do know that it is a certain faculty belonging to every living organism, the faculty for self-determination. It is a strange faculty of the soul itself, for its own direction. The will is indeed the * - faculty which every individual possesses from the very moment of conception, for exerting a certain control over the vital and automatic processes of his own evolu- tion. It does not depend originally on mind. Originally it is a purely spon- taneous control-factor of the living uncon- scious. It seems as if, primarily, the will 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS and the conscience were identical, in the premental state. It seems as if the will were given as a great balancing faculty, the faculty whereby automatization is prevented in the evolving psyche. The spontaneous will reacts at once against the exaggeration of any one particular circuit of polarity. Any vital circuit a fact known to psychoanalysis. And against this automatism, this degradation from the spontaneous- vital reality into the mechanic-material reality, the human soul must always struggle. And the will is the power which the unique self possesses to right itself from automatism. Sometimes, however, the free psyche really collapses, and the will identifies itself with an automatic circuit. Then a complex is set up, a paranoia. Then incipient madness sets in.

There may come sudden jolts of dislocation of the whole psychic flow, like epilepsy. Or there may come any of the known forms of primary mad- ness. The second danger is that the will shall identify itself with the mind and become an instrument of the mind. The same process of automatism sets up, only now it is slower. The mind proceeds to assume control over every organic-psychic circuit. The spontaneous flux is destroyed, and a certain automatic circuit substituted. Now an automatic establishment of the psyche must, like the building of a machine, proceed according to some definite fixed scheme, based upon certain fixed prin- ciples.

It is a long, slow development in madness. Quite justly do the advanced Russian and French writers acclaim mad- ness as a great goal. It is the genuine goal of self-automatism, mental-conscious supremacy. True, we must all develop into mental consciousness. But mental-consciousness is not a goal ; it is a cul-de-sac.
