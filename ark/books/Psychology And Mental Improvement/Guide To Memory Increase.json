Rocco in 1982 formulated a Health Food Range of Athletic and Naturopathics Supplement Formulas under the name Life Elixir Naturopathics. These are sold nationally, Singapore, Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. Due to it's great success Australian Company Bio Organics wanted the company and bought if from Rocco in 1987, then in 1988 Natural Health Products Pty. Ltd. bought Bio Organics and are now also the owners of Life Elixir Naturopathics. Rocco published 34 issues of Australia's first Muscle Magazine called Muscle Australia 1979 to 1987, featuring mostly P.B.B.I. contests and Muscle Men and Women enjoying international publicity as the magazine was sold in U.S.A., England, France, Italy, New Zealand and Asia. Rocco founded the first professional bodybuilding organisation in Australia â€” Pacific Body Building International (P.B.B.I.) from 1979 to 1988 and has promoted over 90 body building contests with a total of over 2000 muscle men and women who have competed under the P.B.B.I. flag in Victoria, N.S.W., S.A. and New Zealand. Rocco has published over 30 books on weight training, muscle growth, physical and mental health. Rocco Oppedisano has been training seventeen years as a professional bodybuilder and is one of the founding fathers of bodybuilding in Australia. He has won almost every title possible: Mr. Australia 1976, Mr. Australasia 1979 Class 1, Australia's Most Muscular Man 1976,1979 and 1980, New York's Most Muscular Man 1978 and Mr. South Eastern Australia 1981. Rocco Oppedisano has the reputation of building the most men and women bodybuilding champions in the history of Australia and also was owner of the legendary Muscle Australia Gym. That won the reputation of building the most muscle stars in the history of Australia from 1982 to 1988. Rocco still holds the record for winning Mr. Australia in the shortest amount of time in 21 months of total training at only 21 years old. Note: Rocco's P.B.B.I. contests, Muscle Australia Magazine and Muscle Australia Gym collapsed due to Rocco's personal bankruptcy and being caught in the 1987 October share market crash. But after 3 years of absence Rocco made a comeback in 1990."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1 - Eight Laws Of Memory 1. The Law Of Comprehension. This is the simplest, but also the most important. According to the German writer Georg Lichtenberg, people poorly remember what they read because \"they do too little thinking\". The more deeply you grasp what you memorise, the more easily and the more in detail it will remain in your memory. 2. The Law Of Interest. \"For knowledge to be digested, it must be absorbed with relish,\" wrote Anatole France. The interesting and \"the appetising\" is remembered easily as man does not have to make special efforts, as the ability to spontaneously memorise comes into play. 3. The Law Of Previous Knowledge. The more one knows on a certain subject, the more easily one memorises everything new pertaining to it. Everyone must have noticed that when he opens a book read long ago, he reads it as if he had never read it before. This means that when he read it for the first time he lacked the relevant experience and information but by this time he has accumulated them. Thus reading forms connections between the accumulated and the new knowledge. This is the result of memorisation. 4. The Law Of Readiness For Memorisation. The reader derives the information he sets out to derive from the text. The same goes for the duration of memorisation. When one wants to remember something for long, one will remember it in any case better than when one wants to remember something for a brief while. 5. The Law Of Associations. This was formulated back in the 4th century B.C. by Aristotle. The concepts which arose simultaneously summon each other up from the memory bank by association. For instance, the atmosphere of a room evokes recollections about events which took place in it (or recollection of what you read staying in it, and this is exactly what you need). 6. The Law Of Sequences. The alphabet is easy to recite in its regular order and difficult in the reverse order. The conceptions learned in a certain sequence, when recalled, summon each other up in the same sequence. 7. The Law Of Strong Impressions. The stronger the first impression of what is being memorised, the brighter the image. The greater the number of information channels, the more strongly the information is retained. Hence, the task is to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"achieve the strongest possible initial impression of the material subject. 8. The Law Of Inhibition. Any subsequent memorisation inhibits the previous. The learned portion of information must \"settle\" before the next is taken up. The best way to forget newly memorised material is by trying to memorise something similar directly afterwards. This is why school children are advised not to learn physics after mathematics and literature after history and to learn poetry before going to bed. Memorisation Advice Before you set about reading a book, article or document, try to guess from its title what is written in it (or what you would write in the author's place). The same \"forecasting\" applies to the heads of chapters and the first paragraphs of the text. Before reading (listening and glancing through) think of what information you want to derive, and what for. This will stimulate your interest and prepare you for its cognition. Where the author, citing a number of arguments, is going to draw a conclusion, make a deduction yourself first and only then continue to read. Before reading recall all relevant information known to you. In other words, \"brush up\" your knowledge. Try to imitate Ancient Roman orators, who learned their speeches pacing up and down and \"establishing connections\" between the text and the atmosphere of their homes and then would recall the speech by taking \"mental strolls\". If you want to memorise a text in detail don't learn it piecemeal. Learn the whole text, and learn it in its natural sequence. To avoid forgetting the name of a new acquaintance, strengthen the first impression left by him by repeating his name aloud (\"Excuse me, have I heard you right?\"), using it in the conversation and when parting. Write down this name, if only with your finger in the air. imagine in whose honour this man may have been named, etc. Try to evoke the strongest possible emotions connected with the information you memorise. Incidentally, this is exactly what Lenin did. The margins of the books he read bristle with categorical and profoundly emotional notes: \"True!\", \"What nonsense!\", \"Ha-ha!\", and \"You've hit the nail on the head!\" When preparing for intensive mental efforts consider the state you are in at the moment. Sadness, irritation, uncertainty and fear are enemies of memory."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Never write down things without an attempt to grasp and memorise them! To these rules you may add a host of your own, based on the laws of memory. In short, the knowledge of these laws will enable you to memorise much more than before even if you had complaints about your memory. Abridged from the Russian magazine EKO"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2 - Help Relieve Two Memory Invaders Two leading causes of emotional unrest and mental breakdown are mental depression and hysteria. Where chemotherapy was once used exclusively to treat them, now doctors are beginning to use nutritional therapy. To understand how proper nutrition can help us meet the emotional challenges of daily living, we need to understand the nature of these two distressing conditions: (1) Mental Depression. Known as \"the blues\" or \"hanging on\", this is a melancholy and downcast mood. When extreme and prolonged, it may lead to more serious disorders. Typical emotional symptoms include fear, anxiety, worry, indecision, pessimism, brooding and unwillingness to co-operate. Involutional melancholia is a form of mental depression seen in late middle-age, more commonly in women than in men, and appears to have some relationship with the change in the endocrine pattern that follows the middle years. Here is where proper nutrition may help to boost endocrine substances and maintain a healthful glandular balance. To a certain extent, depression is also a psychosomatic illness. When a depressed person comes to the doctor and says he aches here or there, he is constipated, he can't taste his food, he may not be imagining it. Many emotionally depressed people do have endocrine and neuromuscular or autonomic system dysfunctions. During emotional depression there is a major functional disruption of the autonomic nerves, the adrenal, the thyroid, which upsets the homeostasis (body balance) of the organism. Prolonged depression may lead to tissue depletion, forms of arthritis and ulcers. To tell the individual \"it's all in your mind\" is to do him a disservice. These days many doctors are seeking nutritional means to help restore body homeostasis and ease depression. Hysteria. Usually regarded as a \"neurosis\", this emotional disruption is often marked by shouting, gesticulating, wild weeping and other similar behaviour. Often a temper tantrum is a good example of hysteria. The hysterical person often converts his emotional conflicts into physical symptoms. Because of prolonged stress and neurological abuse, hysteria can lead to visual disturbances, hearing defects, paralysis, choking, convulsions, pains and fever. A number of doctors have found that corrective food programs with emphasis on certain vitamins, minerals, proteins can help boost resistance to stress and ease the problem. Let's see what has been reported: A Doctor's Plan For \"Mind Food\". Dr. George A. Wilson spent over 40 years in practice, testing some thousands of patients who were"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"victims of depression and hysteria and who had physical ailments induced by the emotional upsets. He believes that a delicate acid-alkaline balance is necessary to boost healthful metabolism and to feed the body the nutrients that then work to feed the mind. Writing in A New Slant to Diet, Dr. Wilson reports that (1) the more alkaline in the digestive system, the more nervous the person is; (2) the more acid, the more he is able to digest nutrients and be able to fight problems of stress. He feels that a balance â€” which he terms \"bio-electric force\" â€” would help the body withstand tensions and strains and help heal emotional disorders. Dr. Wilson lists six stress-tension disorders that disturb the acid balance and lead to alkalinity. Furthermore, such stresses destroy the body supply of Vitamin C â€” ascorbic acid â€” needed by the adrenal glands to help boost emotional health. The key to better health, Dr. Wilson believes, is to avoid these six stress-tension situations: shocks, keen disappointments, intense emotional upsets, excess fear and worry, overwork and inadequate rest. Dr. Wilson also notes that most people have: (1) More acid in the afternoon, more alkaline in early morning. (2) More acid in summer, more alkaline in winter. (3) More acid during exercise, more alkaline during rest. (4) More alkaline when chilled, tired, chronically sick or at the onset of illness. To boost the acid-reserves in the early morning, in winter, during prolonged rest and during the onset of an illness, Dr. Wilson suggests taking a \"tonic\" of one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and honey in a glass of water at those times. He also recommends it when a person feels tired, irritable, has cold hands and feet (often a symptom of choked-up, tension-induced poor circulation); for aches and stiffness, and digestive upset. Also, any fresh fruit juice will provide a good supply of vital nutrients as well as the acid needed to maintain a proper balance. Needless to say, Dr. Wilson's tonic should get your own doctor's okay before you take it. There may be some other reason for your symptoms. Dr. Wilson further suggests eating properly balanced meals to help stabilise metabolism. He suggests the reduction or elimination of starches and sweets, and he offers this program to his patients: (1) Meat once a day. Other proteins were acceptable at other meals. (2) One slice of whole-grain, unbleached bread daily. (3) Select vegetables whose leaves are exposed to the sun's rays. Examples: alfalfa, celery (stalks and leaves), dandelion greens, endive, kale, mustard greens, turnip leaves, watercress, parsley, asparagus, red-beet leaves and carrot leaves. (4) Eat fruit between meals rather than with meals. Dr. Wilson's theory: fruits do not necessarily energise but they do cleanse and are important between meals to help prepare the digestive system for the next meal. (Note: Other findings indicate that natural fruit sugar helps promote energy, but Dr. Wilson feels that in combination with other foods, the energising effect is somewhat abated.) Dr. Wilson also warns his nervous and tense patients NOT to eat a heavy meal at night. This leads to tossing and turning and prolonged emotional stress."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The doctor may well be on the threshold of healing mental depression and hysteria through corrective nutrition. At any rate, he reports being able to \"emotionally strengthen\" hundreds of patients with his natural foods program. How Magnesium Helps Ease Nervous Tremors. The mineral magnesium has been hailed as a \"nerve food\" by leading physicians. A team of doctors reported to the Journal of the American Medical Association on its emotion-healing power. Here are some of its reported benefits. Magnesium therapy soothed such emotion-based problems as irritability, anxiety, muscle weakness, unsteady gait, staggering, vertigo-twitching, numbness, and cramps in hands and feet. It was also suggested for anyone feeling depression, or hysteria, or some other related emotional upsets coming on, as a soothing and all-natural relaxer. Food sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, liver, meat, eggs, whole grain products. Blackstrap molasses and whole wheat products like wheat germ are other good sources. According to Mildred S. Seelig, M.D., in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, patients with emotional disorders who need magnesium should have this minimum intake: 385 milligrams daily for a 140-lb. woman; 500 milligrams daily for a 185-lb. man. Says Dr. Seelig: \"The diet should be supplemented with magnesium at least until equilibrium is noted and then possibly reduced to meet the body need.\" Correct dosage, of course, is up to the physician. That magnesium therapy can work is pointed up in the case of a 68-year-old man, who, following an abdominal operation, suddenly became irrational, noisy, wildly restless, confused and combative. His case, reported in the American Journal of Internal Medicine (1955), describes how he experienced hallucinations, was depressed and also-showed symptoms of hysteria. His brain and heart pattern were abnormal. Vitamins, dextrose, potassium and calcium were prescribed without much help. Then the doctors gave him magnesium and calcium. In 18 hours, after he received the magnesium prescription, the man was rational, oriented and reported to be completely free of neuro-muscular disorder. In three days, he was up and around. Calcium To Calm The Nervous System. Researcher Catharyn Elwood in Feel Like a Million, lauds the use of calcium to help calm the nervous system. She explains: \"Without calcium, in solution in the blood, the nerves cannot send messages. The nerves become tense. They cannot relax. In children, this shows in unpleasant dispositions, temper tantrums and easy, fretful crying. In serious deficiencies, the muscles twitch, have spasms and even convulsions. In adults, they show calcium deficiencies with nervous habits such as finger tapping and tensing of the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"foot, or swinging it when the leg is crossed. They are impatient and snap at their loved ones when they really want to be patient and kind. They are easily annoyed, jump at slight noises and often are grouchy. They become restless and cannot sit still very long. They usually suffer from insomnia.\" Dairy products, turnip and mustard greens, collards, kale, broccoli are natural food sources of calcium. Calcium tablets are available. Catharyn Elwood suggests: \"For nerves to relax and to send your impulses, you need calcium. No calcium can be absorbed unless phosphorus and Vitamin D are also on the job. See that you get at least two grams of calcium and never less than one hour of sunbathing or 800 to 4000 units of Vitamin D daily. Use a safe, raw milk and unrefined vegetable oils.\" She also recommends magnesium, Vitamins B1 and B6 as mineral-vitamin emotion \"soothers\": \"Vitamin BI is the most important nerve relaxer of all the B-complex vitamins ... Lack of Vitamin B1 indirectly starves the nerves, for their one and only food is sugar. Sugar comes from completely digesting carbohydrates, which is impossible if B1 is lacking ... Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is gaining fame as another important member of the family for calm and steady nerves.\" The \"Nerve-Building Vitamin\". To meet the challenge of emotional stress with proper nutrition, doctors have found that one nutrient â€” Vitamin B12 â€” has an amazing power to insulate the nervous system against emotional upset. A deficiency of Vitamin B12 may adversely affect the nervous system, writes J. MacDonald Holmes, M.D. in Medical News (4:67). Dr. Holmes makes note of the fact that Vitamin B12 helps to maintain the integrity of the \"myalin sheath\", the fat like substance which forms a protective insulating sleeve around delicate nerve fibres. A deficiency can cause such emotional symptoms as tingling sensations in the limbs, numbness, shooting pains and feelings of hot and cold. The limbs feel stiff and weak, and sensations of touch, pain and temperature are blunted."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"3 - How Good Is Your Memory? Your memory is phenomenal. 1. Most people remember fewer than 10 per cent of the names of those whom they meet. 2. Most people forget more than 99 per cent of the phone numbers given to them. 3. Memory is supposed to decline rapidly with age. 4. Many people drink, and alcohol is reputed to destroy 1000 brain cells per drink. 5. Internationally, across races, cultures, ages and education levels, there is a common experience, and fear of, having an inadequate or bad memory. 6. Our failures in general, and especially in remembering, are attributed to the fact that we are 'only human', a statement that implies that our skills are inherently inadequate. Your memory does decline with age, but only if it is not used. Conversely, if it is used, it will continue to improve throughout your lifetime. There is no evidence to suggest that moderate drinking destroys brain cells. This misapprehension arose because it was found that excessive drinking, and only excessive drinking, did indeed damage the brain. Across cultural and international boundaries 'negative experience' with memory can be traced not to our being 'only human' or in anyway innately inadequate but to two simple, easily changeable factors: (1) negative mental set and (2) lack of knowledge. Negative Mental Set There is a growing and informal international organisation, which I choose to name the 'I've Got an Increasingly Bad Memory Club'. How often do you hear people in animated and enthusiastic conversation saying things like, 'You know, my memory's not nearly as good as it used to be when I was younger; I'm constantly forgetting things'. To which there is an equally enthusiastic reply: 'Yes, I know exactly what you mean; the same thing's happening to me ...' And off they dodder, arms draped around each other's shoulders, down the hill to mental oblivion. And such conversations often take place between thirty-year-olds! Consider the younger supermemoriser to whom most people romantically refer. If you want to check for yourself, go back to any school at the end of a day, walk into a classroom of a group of five to seven-year-old children after they have gone home and ask the teacher what has been left in the classroom (i.e. forgotten). You will find the following items: watches, pencils, pens, sweets, money, jackets, physical education equipment, books, coats, glasses, erasers, toys, etc. The only real difference between the middle-aged executive who has forgotten to phone someone he was supposed to phone and who has left his briefcase at the office, and the seven-year-old child who realises on returning home that he's left at school his watch, his pocket-money and his homework is that the seven-year-old does not collapse into depression, clutching his head and exclaiming, 'Oh, Christ, I'm seven years old and my memory's going!'"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Ask yourself, 'What is the number of things I actually remember each day?' Most people estimate somewhere between 100 and 10,000. The answer is in fact in the multiple billions. The human memory is so excellent and runs so smoothly that most people don't even realise that every word they speak and every word they listen to are instantaneously produced for consideration, recalled, recognised precisely and placed in their appropriate context. Nor do they realise that every moment, every perception, every thought, everything that they do throughout the entire day and throughout their lives is a function of their memories. In fact, its ongoing accuracy is almost perfect. The few odd things that we do forget are like odd specks on a gigantic ocean. Ironically, the reason why we notice so dramatically the errors that we make is that they are so rare. There is now increasing evidence that our memories may not only be far better than we ever thought but may in fact be perfect. Consider the following arguments for this case: 1. Dreams Many people have vivid dreams of acquaintances, friends, family and lovers of whom they have not thought for as many as twenty to forty years. In their dreams, however, the images are perfectly clear, all colours and details being exactly as they were in real life. This confirms that somewhere in the brain there is a vast store of perfect images and associations that does not change with time and that, with the right trigger, can be recalled. 2. Surprise Random Recall Practically everyone has had the experience of turning a comer and suddenly recalling people or events from previous times in his life. This often happens when people revisit their first school. A single smell, touch, sight or sound can bring back a flood of experiences thought to be forgotten. This ability of any given sense to reproduce perfect memory images indicates that if there were more correct 'trigger situations' much more would and could be recollected. We know from such experiences that the brain has retained the information. 3. The Russian 'S' In the early part of this century a young Russian journalist (in The Mind of a Mnemonist, by A. R. Luria, he is referred to as 'S') attended an editorial meeting, and it was noted to the consternation of others that he was not taking notes. When pressed to explain, he became confused; to everyone's amazement, it became apparent that he really did not understand why anyone should ever take notes. The explanation that he gave for not taking notes himself was that he could remember what the editor was saying, so what was the point? Upon being challenged, 'S' reproduced the entire speech, word for word, sentence for sentence, and inflection for inflection. For the next thirty years he was to be tested and examined by Alexander Luria, Russia's leading"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"psychologist and expert on memory. Luria confirmed that 'S' was in no way abnormal but that his memory was indeed perfect. Luria also stated that at a very young age 'S' had 'stumbled upon' the basic mnemonic principles (see pages 39ff.) and that they had become part of his natural functioning. 'S' was not unique. The history of education, medicine and psychology is dotted with similar cases of perfect memorisers. In every instance, their brains were found to be normal, and in every instance they had, as young children, 'discovered' the basic principles of their memory's function. 4. Professor Rosensweig's Experiments Professor Mark Rosensweig, a Californian psychologist and neurophysiologist, spent years studying the individual brain cell and its capacity for storage. As early as 1974 he stated that if we fed in ten new items of information every second for an entire lifetime to any normal human brain that brain would be considerably less than half full. He emphasised that memory problems have nothing to do with the capacity of the brain but rather with the self-management of that apparently limitless capacity. 5. Professor Penfield's Experiments Professor Wilder Penfield of Canada came across his discovery of the capacity of human memory by mistake. He was stimulating individual brain cells with tiny electrodes for the purpose of locating areas of the brain that were the cause of patients' epilepsy. To his amazement he found that when he stimulated certain individual brain cells, his patients were suddenly recalling experiences from their past. The patients emphasised that it was not simple memory, but that they actually were reliving the entire experience, including smells, noises, colours, movement, tastes. These experiences ranged from a few hours before the experimental session to as much as forty years earlier. Penfield suggested that hidden within each brain cell or cluster of brain cells lies a perfect store of every event of our past and that if we could find the right stimulus we could replay the entire film. 6. The Potential Pattern-Making Ability of Your Brain Professor Pyotr Anokhin, the famous Pavlov's brightest student, spent his last years investigating the potential pattern-making capabilities of the human brain. His findings were important for memory researchers. It seems that memory is recorded in separate little patterns, or electromagnetic circuits, that are formed by the brain's interconnecting cells. Anokhin already knew that the brain contained a million million (1,000,000,000,000) brain cells but that even this gigantic number was going to be small in comparison with the number of patterns that those brain cells could make among themselves. Working with advanced electron microscopes and computers, he came up with a staggering number. Anokhin calculated that the number of patterns, or 'degrees of freedom', throughout the brain is, to use"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"his own words, 'so great that writing it would take a line of figures, in normal manuscript characters, more than ten and a half million kilometres in length. With such a number of possibilities, the brain is a keyboard on which hundreds of millions of different melodies can be played'. Your memory is the music. 7. Near-Death-Type Experiences Many people have looked up at the surface ripples of a swimming pool from the bottom, knowing that they were going to drown within the next two minutes; or seen the rapidly disappearing ledge of the mountain from which they have just fallen; or felt the oncoming grid of the 10-ton lorry bearing down on them at 60 miles per hour. A common theme runs through the accounts that survivors of such traumas tell. In such moments of 'final consideration' the brain slows all things down to a standstill, expanding a fraction of a second into a lifetime, and reviews the total experience of the individual. When pressed to admit that what they had really experienced were a few highlights, the individuals concerned insisted that what they had experienced was their entire lire, including all things they had completely forgotten until that instant of time. 'My whole life flashed before me' has almost become a clichÃ© that goes with the near-death experience. Such a commonality of experience again argues for a storage capacity of the brain that we have only just begun to tap. 8. Photographic Memory Photographic, or eidetic, memory is a specific phenomenon in which people can remember, usually for a very short time, perfectly and exactly anything they have seen. This memory usually fades, but it can be so accurate as to enable somebody, after seeing a picture of 1000 randomly sprayed dots on a white sheet, to reproduce them perfectly. This suggests that in addition to the deep, long-term storage capacity, we also have a shorter-term and immediate photographic ability. It is argued that children often have this ability as a natural part of their mental functioning and that we train it away by forcing them to concentrate too much on logic and language and too little on imagination and their other range of mental skills. 9. The 1000 Photographs In recent experiments people were shown 1000 photographs, one after the other, at a pace of about one photograph per second. The psychologists then mixed 100 photographs with the original 1000, and asked the people to select those they had not seen the first time through. Everyone, regardless of how he described his normal memory, was able to identify almost every photograph he had seen â€” as well as each one that he had not seen previously. They were not necessarily able to remember the order in which the photographs had been presented, but they could definitely remember the image â€” an example that confirms the common human experience of being better able to remember a face than the name attached to it. This particular problem is easily dealt with by applying the Memory Techniques. 10. The Memory Techniques"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Memory techniques, or mnemonics, were a system of 'memory codes' that enabled people to remember perfectly whatever it was they wished to remember. Experiments with these techniques have shown that if a person scores 9 out of 10 when using such a technique, that same person will score 900 out of 1000, 9000 out of 10,000, 900,000 out of 1,000,000 and so on. Similarly, one who scores perfectly out of 10 will score perfectly out of 1,000,000. These techniques help us to delve into that phenomenal storage capacity we have and to pull out whatever it is that we need."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4 - Is Sugar A Memory Killer? Sugar is a non-food. It is a pure carbohydrate that offers illusion of energy, only to cause a downhill slump after the initial burst has worn off. Sugar further contributes to emotional upset because it \"sops up\" the Vitamin B-complex during metabolism. These vitamins nourish the nervous system. As has been pointed out, a deficiency may lead to emotional upset. Sugar, by its depleting action, may cause a deficiency. By upsetting the delicate blood-sugar levels, it may cause a mind-bending, mind-destroying action. It has been reported to distort mentality, trigger erratic behaviour and memory loss. Joseph Wilder, M.D., writing in The Nervous Child, blames excess sugar consumption for the fact that so many children display neurotic symptoms. Youngsters, according to Dr. Wilder, consume a lot of sugar in their cravings for sweets and so are more susceptible to these emotional disorders. Because of this, they face a serious threat in their mental health \"for the importance of nutrition for mental (and physical) functioning is much greater in children than in adults\". An excess of sugar, says Dr. Wilder, is emotionally hazardous. \"In adults faulty or insufficient nutrition may alter or impair specific or general mental functions, and eventually cause reparable or even irreparable structural damage of the central nervous system. In children, we face a serious additional factor. The development of the brain may be retarded, stopped, altered, and thus the mental functions may become impaired in indirect and not less serious ways\". Sugar metabolism leaches out the nerve-breeding vitamins and distress signals are noted. The person overeats or does not want to eat at all. Often, memory is impaired. Nightmares, sleepwalking, poor learning, absent-mindedness, mischievousness, inability to get things done â€” all these may result. \"Laziness may be caused by hypoglycemia (low blood sugar),\" says Dr. Wilder, \"with mental fatigue, dullness, indifference, lack of initiative and above all, severe inability to make decisions\". A serious condition of an overloaded sugar system may lead to violence. Dr. Wilder explains, \"The child may be neurotic, psychopathic or have criminal tendencies and be subject to anxiety, running away tendencies, aggressiveness, a blind urge to activity and destructiveness, with impairment of moral sensibilities like shame. \"In its simplest form, it is the tendency to deny everything, contradict everything, refuse everything at any price ... It is no wonder that a considerable number of criminal and semi-criminal acts have been observed in children in ... [low blood sugar] states, ranging from destructiveness or violation of traffic regulations all the way to arson and homicide\". Dr. Wilder also says that \"the well-known problem of the relation of poverty to crime calls for an investigation from the angle of hypoglycemia ... In such an investigation, we must also keep in mind the possible irreparable anatomical damage and arrest of development in young brains caused by malnutrition in childhood, even if the patient or criminal does not present any metabolic abnormalities at the time of investigation\"."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"In an article in The Handbook of Correctional Psychology, Dr. Joseph Wilder offers a number of cases of criminal acts performed by individuals who had a history of high sugar intake and showed symptoms of hypoglycemia. The crimes included homicide, arson, mutilation. Throughout Dr. Wilder's report are statements like this: \"After the patient's arrest, his family physician notified the defense that two years prior to the crime, a sugar tolerance curve (blood sugar test) had shown a tendency to hypoglycemia\". Hitler has been called a \"sugar drunkard\" and this may have been one reason for his being a trigger- brained, raving, rabble-rousing maniac. His over consumption of sugar may have created a low blood sugar condition and the consequent screaming fits of rage. Hitler's Love for Sweets. Ernst Hanfstaengl, the Fuhrer's personal pianist, in his book, Unheard Witness, tells how Hitler loved sweets and favoured whipped-cream cakes. There was always a box of candy around. The pianist writes that Hitler could not drink wine unless he put sugar Into it! In his early years, when he was in jail, his friends deluged him with boxes of candy, knowing of his addiction. Hanfstaengl writes, \"Hitler ... had the most incredibly sweet tooth of any man I have ever met ...\" While there certainly were many other factors involved in Hitler's distorted mind, his sugar consumption may have been the hypoglycemia \"trigger\" that exploded other symptoms. Sugar is an artificial creation. The sugar molecule is something like Cn H<2>n On (Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen). It has no nutrients. It is water soluble and rushes into the bloodstream, spending little time in the digestive system. It is regarded as a chemical compound and disrupts normal health patterns of the biological system. It could well cause an abnormal strain on the mental processes. H. Stutte, M.D., a court physician to officials in Marburg, Germany writing on the problems of excess sugar in Das Neue Zeitalter, alerts us to the possibility of a connection between low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and some auto accidents: \"A person with hypoglycemia who is suddenly overcome in the thickest of the traffic in a large city with disorders of his vision or a state of weakness ... who reacts incorrectly as a result of loss of initiative or blurred consciousness, this person can easily provoke an accident in which he himself or another person can be the victim.\" This condition \"threatens special danger when it overcomes the driver at the steering wheel and â€” as is often the case â€” this person is not conscious of the fact that he is disturbed and continues to drive ... When a car suddenly cuts out into the opposite lane and has a collision where there are good lighting conditions on a curve that can be seen well or for that matter even on a straight highway, one should not satisfy himself with the laconic statement 'going too fast', but also think about the possibility of hypoglycemia ...\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Dr. Sutte would like to see medical tests given in such cases: \"An intensification of the investigation of the causes (in the area of medicine as well as in the area of technology) would probably be of essentially greater value for the prevention of accidents than the continual increase of punitory regulations.\" The Sugar Energy Fallacy. There is a popular -and erroneousâ€” theory that sugar supplies energy. Here is what Dr. Michael J. Walsh, a nutritionist, has to say about this, in Modern Nutrition. \"Acting on the false-to-fact identification that sugar is energy, people eat more and more sugar in the naive belief that they are going to get more and more energy. Instead of more and more, they are likely to get less and less energy â€” if the more and more sugar is in the form of the 'concentrated, refined, fermentable carbohydrates' which includes sugar out of the sugar bowl, sweetened gelatin desserts, sweetened breads, rolls, doughnuts, pastries, cookies, pies, cakes, sweetened alcoholic beverages, sweetened processed cereals, syrup from canned fruits, etc.\" Dr. Michael Walsh explains that this type of sugar reduces energy because it is \"not likely to be accompanied by sufficient quantities of other factors (such as Vitamin B1) which are needed to ensure the completion of the intermediate stages of carbohydrate metabolism ... A consequence of failure to complete the energy transformation is fatigue ...\" Consumer Bulletin had the following item of interest regarding the so-called energy power of sugar: \"The 'quick energy' that comes from carbohydrates and is so much praised in advertising of the sugar interests is short-lived. The malnourished Child who is fed much sugar will quickly lose interest in activity after his bottle of soft drink or an ice cream soda, and soon sink back into his prior passive state\". Many parents may be guilty of inducing mental sluggishness in a child by allowing him to overload his system with sugar-containing foods. A Sugar-Free Program For Marital Problems. A California physician has suggested that many marital conflicts could be resolved if the couple went on a sugar-free diet. Cecelia Rosenfeld, M.D., writing in the medical journal New Medical Materia declares: \"One of the prime causes of marital discord â€” nutritional deficiency â€” is too often overlooked. In my own practice, I have found that a surprising number of 'broken marriage' spouses suffered from a blood-sugar imbalance. \"Many of these husbands and wives showed symptoms of irritability, violent temper, abnormal"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"sensitivity and extreme fatigue. In most cases, there was no evidence of organic disease. Corrective nutritional guidance dispelled these unpleasant symptoms for many spouses and in the process often bolstered their crumbling marriages.\" The doctor tells of the case of Mrs. R.L, a 34-year-old secretary. The woman was tired, showed poor concentration and suffered from chronic emotional depression. Her home life had deteriorated, and she was separated from her husband. Dr. Rosenfeld treated her with nutritional-therapy. It was four months before any improvement was noted, but soon after she was able to rejoin her husband and try again for a happy life. It is believed she still follows the natural food program and has eliminated sugar from her food program. Mr. T.E., a 53-year-old business executive, suffered from nervous tensions, including pounding migraine headaches. The man's wife said he was the victim of such chronic irritability and nervous unrest that no one could live with him. They were on the verge of a divorce. Dr. Rosenfeld put them both on an all-natural nutritional program â€” with no white sugar. In two months, the husband's headaches ended and he became easier to live with. He and his wife not only didn't get a divorce, they took a six-month voyage around the world! Obviously many other factors may enter into marital discord. But know that improper sugar metabolism and resulting hypoglycemia can make an individual emotionally unstable, incapable of reasoning out basic differences. It is gratifying that more and more doctors are checking out the possibility of low blood sugar as a contributing factor when an unhappy man and wife seek help. Only a healthy body can build a healthy mind. Together, they add up to a healthy marriage! Sugar And Psycho-Neurotic Disorders. In his book, Body, Mind and Sugar, Dr. E.M. Abrahamson tells the story of a 48-year-old woman, P.J., who suffered from claustrophobia, loss of memory and other emotional disorders. She had undergone expensive psychoanalysis, shock treatments, injections of insulin. She was so depressed, she no longer wanted to live. When she came to Dr. Abrahamson he noted from various tests that she was a sugar-holic. He put her on a high-protein, low-starch and very low-sugar program. \"Within a week, she began to feel better, both physically and emotionally. In two weeks she was able to travel alone, which had been impossible for her for years.\" Through nutritional therapy, P.J. was able to recover from emotional distress when other, more traditional, treatments failed.

It was her name from which was derived the current word mnemonics, used to describe memory techniques such as those you are about to learn. In Greek and Roman times, senators would learn these techniques in order to impress other politicians and the public with their phenomenal powers of learning and memory. Using these simple but sophisticated methods, the Romans were able to remember, without fault, thousands of items, including statistics relating to their empire, and became the rulers of their time. Long before we had discovered the physiological breakdown of the functions in the left and right hemispheres of our brains, the Greeks had intuitively realised that there are two underlying principles that ensure perfect memory: 1. Imagination 2. Association Whereas, in current times, most of us are actively discouraged from using our imaginative abilities, and consequently learn very little about the nature of mental association, the Greeks emphasised these two foundation stones of mental functioning and opened the way for us to develop the techniques even further. Quite simply, if you want to remember anything, all you have to do is to associate (link) it with some known or fixed item. The Rules The rules for perfect memory laid down by the Greeks fit in exactly with the information recently discovered about the left and right brains. Without a scientific basis, the Greeks realised that in order to remember well, you have to use every aspect of your mind. In order to remember well, you must include in your associated and linked mental landscape the following: 1. Colour. The more colours you use, and the more vivid they are, the better. Using colour alone can improve your memory by as much as 50 per cent. 2. Imagination. Your imagination is the powerhouse of your memory. The more vividly you can imagine, the more easily you will remember. Sub-areas within imagination include the following: a. Expansion: the more gigantic and enormous you can make your mental images, the better. b. Contraction: if you can clearly imagine your picture as extremely tiny, you will remember it well. c. Absurdity: the more ridiculous, zany and absurd your mental images are, the more they will be outstanding and thus the more they will be remembered."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"3. Rhythm. The more rhythm and variation of rhythm in your mental picture, the more that picture will weave itself into your memory. 4. Movement. As often as possible, try to make your mental images move. Moving objects are usually remembered better than still ones. 5. The Senses: Tasting Touching Smelling Seeing Hearing The more you can involve all your senses in your memory image, the more you will remember it. For example, if you have to remember that you have to buy bananas, you stand a far better chance of not forgetting your task if you can actually imagine smelling a banana as you touch it with your hands, bite into it with your mouth and taste it, see it as it is approaching your face, and hear yourself munching it. 6. Sex. Sex is one of your strongest drives, and if you apply this aspect of yourself to your magnificent daydreaming ability, your memory will improve. 7. Sequencing and Ordering. Imagination alone is not enough for memory. In order to function well, your mind needs order and sequence. This helps it to categorise and structure things in such a way as to make them more easily accessible, much in the same way as an ordered filing system allows easier retrieval of information than if that same information were simply dumped randomly on the floor. 8. Number. To make ordering and sequencing easier, it is often advisable to use numbers. 9. Dimension. Use your right-brain ability to see your memory images in 3-D. Key Memory Image Words In each memory system there is a Key Word. This word is the 'Key Memory Word' in that it is the constant peg on which the reader will hang other items he or she wishes to remember. This Key Memory Word is specifically designed to be an 'Image Word' in that it must produce a picture or image in the mind of the person using the memory system. Thus the phrase 'Key Memory Image Word'. As you progress through the increasingly sophisticated mnemonic systems, you will realise the importance of being sure that the pictures you build in your mind contain only the items you want to remember, and those items must be associated with or connected to Key Memory Images. The"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"connections between your basic Memory System Images and the things you wish to remember should be as fundamental and uncomplicated as possible: 1. Crashing things together 2. Sticking things together 3. Placing things on top of each other 4. Placing things underneath each other 5. Placing things inside each other 6. Substituting things for each other 7. Placing things in new situations By now it will be clear to you that the systems worked out by the Greeks, and for nearly 2000 years discarded as mere tricks, were in fact based on the way in which the human brain actually functions. The ancients realised the importance of words, order, sequence and number, now known to be functions of the left side of the brain; and of imagination, colour, rhythm, dimension and daydreaming, now known to be right-brain functions. Mnemosyne was to the Greeks the most beautiful of all the goddesses, proved by the fact that Zeus spent more time in her bed than in that of any other goddess or mortal. He slept with her for nine days and nights, and the result of that coupling was the birth of the nine Muses, the goddesses who preside over love poetry, epic poetry, hymns, dance, comedy, tragedy, music, history and astronomy. For the Greeks, then, the infusion of energy (Zeus) into memory (Mnemosyne) produced both creativity and knowledge. They were correct. If you apply the mnemonic principles and techniques appropriately, not only will your memory improve in the various areas outlined in this book but your creativity, your overall mental functioning and assimilation of knowledge will accelerate at the same fantastic pace. In the process you will be developing a new and dynamic synthesis between the left and right side of your brain."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"6 - Happiness Is Important For A Good Memory Memories In living we all create memories, and we store these memories in a mental tape recorder. We can use these memories constructively or destructively. What should we do with memories? Keep them in proper perspective. I remember on one occasion I was asked to attend a reunion of my medical class. I couldn't accept at that particular time, but fortunately, twenty-five years after graduation, I attended a class reunion. I put on my tuxedo and went to the hotel to meet my colleagues, but I couldn't find them; I couldn't recognise them. When the guests finally seated themselves at their respective tables â€” those who graduated before me and those who graduated after me â€” I looked for my table â€” the Class of 1923 â€” and there I saw nine people seated around the table and one empty seat, mine. I sat down, and the man to my right, a short, fat, bald-headed man, suddenly said to me, \"Maltz, what happened to you? Your hair is grey; it used to be black!\" I looked at his bald head and remembered that he had had beautiful blond hair, and I said to myself, \"I wonder what happened to him?\" Both of us abused our memories. We must learn to use memories only to remember happy moments, so that we can utilise them for the present undertaking. In doing that successfully, we build memories â€” happy memories â€” for tomorrow. The misfortunes of yesterday must be forgotten, lost in the tomb of time. Every day is a new lifetime that must be lived to the full: Creatively. Remember the words of Macedonius (sixth century): Memory and Oblivion, all hail! Memory for goodness, Oblivion for evil! Are You Creative? Many of us are firmly convinced that people are born creative or non-creative, that only a limited number of people can create in different generations. Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Alexander Graham Bell, and Einstein all used their creative gifts widely. Each one had the power to use his imagination properly, productively. What are the characteristics of a creative mind? First, a sense of direction, a goal. Then, a problem, clearly defined, and all the possible solutions. After that, the selection of the best solution and acting on it. You must have the ability to forget a problem, temporarily, if it defies solution and the capacity to rise above failures. I believe that all of us are creative. We have a creative mechanism working for us that steers us toward success. For example, the simple exercise of picking up a pencil. We forget that as children we"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"picked it up clumsily, zigzagging in the direction of the pencil until we learned to do it successfully. This successful performance was registered in the mental tape recorder for future use. This, in a mild sense, is a creative effort. We all can create because we all have imagination. We use it daily without raising it. For example, when we worry, we use imagination in a negative way to create something that doesn't exist. We project on the screen of the mind scenes that haven't happened as yet because we fear we will fail. On the other hand, when we are happy we use the imagination constructively. We picture a worthwhile achievement of the goal we seek by remembering past successes to achieve pleasure in the present. We are all made up of failures and successes, and to think creatively we must rise above the mistakes of the past and use the self-confidence from past successes in our present undertaking. We can think creatively when: 1. We think clearly about a problem. 2. We think of all possible solutions. 3. We accept the best and act upon it. 4. We forget the problem, temporarily, if it defies solution. The servo-mechanism within us will do the job for us subconsciously by utilising the ingredients of our past successes. The greatest creative effort for all of us, great or small, is to create the habit of happiness. This we can all do by making a habit of it every day, by recalling the happiness of past successes and using this good feeling in our present undertaking. Remember Elbert Hubbard's words, \"Happiness is a habit â€” cultivate it!\" Ideas What are ideas? They are the product of the imagination, of thinking and concentrating on a specific subject. An idea is a brainchild, but what kind of a child is it? Is it a child born of resentment or hatred? Is it a deformed child born out of deception and trickery? Or is it a beautiful child born out of love and encouragement, out of hope and belief? These latter children of the mind and spirit are so desperately needed in these chaotic times when it seems that a cannon is more important than a human life, that money is more important than good will, that the destructive thought of taking exceeds the creative thought of giving. It is now, this very minute, that we have to search for self-respect, for the assurance that peace of mind can be ours in this lifetime. It is at this very moment when reason and patience are undergoing an eclipse, when wars are intended to destroy the world forever, that we must live in the hope given us by creative ideas. We should strive to build ideas on compassion and humility, on love and friendship, on taking less and giving more while we are alive, if life on this planet is to be sustained for the future. It is at this very moment that man's fulfillment demands that we see the good in others not the evil; see the hope in others not the frustration; see the joy in others not the sorrow; see the faith in others not the despair."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Great ideas are truths waiting to be fulfilled, and no idea is worth anything unless and until we turn it into worthwhile performance for the benefit of all humanity. Oliver Wendell Holmes said, \"The ultimate good is better achieved by the free trade in ideas\". Our Impulses Should we obey an impulse? We should if the impulse is constructive. Impulses can also be destructive. When we hate we often, through imagination, dispose of the individual. This creates negative impulses that have no value because they distort the self-image. We live every day with imagination. Worry is a form of imagination. Here we throw on the screen of the mind past failures, which inhibit us in our daily tasks of the present. When we are happy, we throw on the screen of the mind past successes, which give us the confidence we exercise in the daily tasks for the present. A good impulse is nothing more than imagination that seeks action to improve the self-image. When I was a young man I had the impulse, the desire, to be a plastic surgeon. This was during a time when the specialty was practically unknown. Despite tremendous objections from my family, I obeyed my impulse. I know a doctor who, twenty years ago, had the impulse to be a baby specialist. He loved children and would have been excellent in this specialty. But he was undecided. He said he'd wait until he had saved enough money, until he could properly provide for his wife and child. One indecision followed another and he never became a baby specialist. Indecision is unbelief. Unbelief is fear. And this constant fear prolongs tension and finally puts us in a state of paralysis. This scars and distorts the self-image, making us less than what we are, preventing us from reaching our true stature of fulfillment. I know a married woman who has two children. She suddenly had the impulse to do abstract painting. She followed her impulse despite objections from her family. Now she sells her paintings. She has made her family happy and herself happy. The point to remember is to obey your impulse, the good impulse. It is a challenge to be happy. It is a chance to put the imagination to work, to reach a worthwhile goal, to fulfill ourselves. Remember the words of George Herbert, \"He begins to die who quits his desires\". Praise What is praise? It is a varied expression of love and friendship, and we should use it more often to compliment someone for a deed well done, for a word well spoken. Why be effusive in our praise of someone when he is put to rest in a cemetery and can't hear a word of it."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"What is praise? Something we all need now and then. Every human being, whether he is a beggar or a tycoon, a peasant or a philosopher, a student or a teacher, whether he is alone or married, searches desperately for recognition. One of the greatest goals for every human being is to feel needed, wanted for something somewhere. We deserve this praise not when we demand it or search for it, but when we receive it naturally in the process of doing something for others, while we are doing something for ourselves. On Stubbornness Life means change. Your image changes every day simply because you are different every day and the situations of each day are different; and that is the way it should be. Man progresses by change. Nature progresses by change â€” spring, summer, winter, fall. Can you imagine if a tree in the spring were stubborn and refused to bud and bear leaves, if a flower were stubborn and refused to bloom, if a vegetable or fruit were stubborn and refused to grow and ripen? Are you stubborn? Do you refuse to change and grow in stature? Are you resistant to creative living, to a smile, to friendship, to forgiveness, to the Brotherhood of Man? Michel de Montaigne said, \"Obstinacy and heat of opinion are the surest proof of stupidity\". To get more living out of life you must start getting rid of negative feelings that create stubbornness and obstinacy, envy, indolence; they all give rise to resistance that makes you shrink to the size of a microbe. Are you a microbe or a whole human being? You have the answer within you, if you overcome stubbornness through forgiveness and friendship to yourself. There is one kind of stubbornness that is creative. If after sharp analysis you find your beliefs worthy of humanity, fight for these beliefs. That is not pig-headedness, that is constructive determination, growth for yourself and for others. Faith And Belief Often at the beginning of my career as a public speaker, I would be overcome with the panic of doubt, a lack of belief in myself, just before I got to the platform to deliver my talk. How would I begin? What would I say? What mistakes would I make? How could I stand there for an hour and face hundreds of people? How could I get through? But when the time came, I was there. I carried on because I had something to say. I did the best I could and I came through with flying colours. And I learned that many of our best actors and actresses are especially nervous just before the curtain goes up. All of us have self-doubts at the beginning of some undertakings whether we are doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, students, poets, or salesmen. Where does faith and belief come from? From within ourselves. We are faith. We are belief. We are"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"also doubt and unbelief. We as individuals must make the decision where we want to go in life, to be the big self or the little self. We must think of our faith and our belief as wings that can make us soar to our destination, to achieve our goals and reach self-fulfillment no matter how crucial our times may be. With doubt and unbelief our creative wings are clipped for the moment and we can't get off the ground to rise above our self-imposed dungeon. We must thank God for doubt and unbelief. It is our moral responsibility to rise above them to make something of ourselves through faith and belief. These characteristics are eternally within us waiting to be recognised, waiting for action. Remember the words of William Blake: If the sun and moon should doubt, They'd immediately go out. On Knowledge Aristotle said, \"All men desire by nature to know\". He wrote this over two thousand years ago but it is still true today. Of course when he said \"all men\", he meant everybody: men and women, rich and poor, black and white, young and old. I suppose there are about ten percent of people who never want to learn, ten percent who know it all; but look at the potentiality of the Brotherhood of Man when eighty percent of all people want to learn to improve, to get more living out of life, and to share this good fortune with others. Man lives in three worlds: the body, the mind, and the spirit. If he stops eating, something happens to him physically. If he stops wanting to learn, something happens to him mentally and spiritually. No food, anemia of the body. No learning, anemia of the mind and spirit. In neither instance can you move in the world creatively and amount to your big self, because you will be working under severe handicaps. Aristotle tells us what we already know, that every American â€” every human being â€” needs, deserves, and should have education. It is as natural for people to learn as it is for them to breathe. Learning is their nucleus of growth and accomplishment. It is also well to remember that the greatest adventure in learning is in getting to know yourself better, and that envy, hatred, stubbornness, indecision, indolence, and fear prevent such an experience. We must resolve to educate our minds to search for and find our big self. On Vanity Thomas A. Kempis said, \"He is truly great that is little in himself and that maketh no account of any height of honour\". These words are the quintessence of humility, when one is not arrogant of his successes nor does he complain about his misfortunes. He insists on living creatively every day, every minute, to give happiness to himself and to share it with others. The reverse of this characteristic is vanity, a common trait that infects the mind and spirit of humanity. As a matter of fact, no one can escape it entirely in a lifetime."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"When you have vanity, you have conceit; and in both instances you falsely believe you are more than what you are which, as a matter of fact, you know the truth â€” that you are less, much less, than what you can be. Then, in your secret embarrassment, you scratch for attention, but it leads to naught. It's like scratching on marble. If the truth be known, you wind up disliking yourself, lost to yourself, neglecting opportunities to find your big self and worthwhile goals. There is nothing in vanity but defeat. Perhaps you would think twice before being vain if you realised that you are playing a depression game, a losing game that automatically makes you a member of the opinionated club; that you become a little dictator who cannot win, who cannot relax, who cannot sleep. The cure: Think kindly of yourself, but don't gloat over successes. Be a good friend to yourself and you will be a good friend to others. Like Thomas A. Kempis said, you will be truly great if you don't make too great an account of your honours. Being Yourself Most people who have failed in an undertaking don't like what they see when they look in the mirror. Young people particularly are affected by this kind of emotional reaction to a problem that seems to defy solution. Just remember that as long as you live you'll be making mistakes now and then; and when you do, it is only natural for you not to like yourself, not to like the image you see of yourself in the mirror, not to like your little self. The point to remember on being yourself is that you must rise above your little self. You must rise above mistakes and misfortunes of yesterday. You must try to reach your big self. People are mistake makers, but they are also mistake breakers. The business of being yourself â€” your big self â€” is to accept yourself for what you are when you make mistakes. Look at yourself in the mirror with kind eyes and realise that you are much bigger than any error, any blunder, any misfortune, any heartache. You must live beyond your mistakes instead of with them. You must accept your weaknesses, stand on your feet in moments of crisis, and rely on the confidence from past successes to turn crises into creative opportunities. If you don't like what you are, get off your own back. Stop living with this hang-up, because you and you alone can either like or dislike what you are. Realise now that you can be your better self, your big self, by rising above your mistakes. That's what successful living is all about. That's what being yourself is all about. By Maxwell Mate M.D., E.I.C.S. America's Wisest Man"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"7 - Remembering Names And Faces Remembering names and faces is one of the most important aspects of our lives, and one of the most difficult. The reason for the difficulty lies in the fact that in most instances the names have no real 'connection' lo the faces. In earlier ages it was exactly the opposite, and the whole system developed for giving people names was based on memory and association: the man you regularly saw covered in white flour with dough all over his hands was Mr. Baker; the man you regularly saw in his own and everyone else's garden was Mr. Gardener; the man who laboured all day over a hot fire pounding metal was Mr. Blacksmith, and so on. As the generations changed and the family name became more and more removed from its original meaning, the task of the memorisation of names and faces became increasingly difficult, reaching the current situation in which the name is a word with no immediate associations with the face. Method for Remembering Names and Faces You will never again find yourself in a situation where you are introduced rapidly to five people and hurriedly repeat, 'Pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you', having been introduced only to the five pairs of shoes at which you look in embarrassment because you know you are immediately going to forget all the names anyway (which you do!). Memory Steps 1. Mental Set. Before you enter a situation in which you will meet people, mentally prepare yourself to succeed and not to fail. Many people enter such situations 'knowing' that they have a bad memory for names and faces and consequently set about proving it to themselves. If you 'know' that your memory is going to improve, you will notice immediate improvement. When preparing yourself for meeting people, try to make sure that you are as poised and relaxed as possible and, also, that wherever possible you have given yourself a two-to five-minute break for preparation. 2. Observe. When you are meeting people, make sure you look them straight in the eye. Don't shuffle around, with your eyes on the floor or looking into the distance. As you look at someone's face, be aware of the special facial characteristics, for this will help you also in the second mnemonic approach to the memorisation of names and faces. From the top of the head to the tip of the chin, enumerating the various characteristics and the ways in which they can be classified and typified. The more you become skilled at the art of observation, the more you will realise just how different one face is from another. If you can sharpen your observational powers, you will have made a giant step toward the improvement of your memory. Blank looking, instead of real seeing, is one of the major causes for poor memory. 3. Listen. Consciously listen, paying attention as much as you possibly can to the sound of the name of the person to whom you are being introduced. This is a crucial stage of the introductory process, at"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"which point many people fail because they were concentrating more on the fact that they were going to forget than on the sound of the name of the person to whom they were being introduced. 4. Request repetition. Even if you have heard the name fairly well, politely say something in the order of 'I'm sorry, would you mind repeating the name?' Repetition is an important memory aid; each repetition of any item you wish to learn greatly increases the probability of your remembering it. 5. Verify the pronunciation. Once you have been given the name, immediately confirm, by asking the person to whom the name belongs, if you have the correct pronunciation. This confirms your interest and once again repeats the name, increasing the probability of your remembering it. 6. Request the Spelling. If there is any doubt about the spelling of the name, politely or playfully ask for the spelling, again confirming your interest and allowing another natural repetition of the name. 7. Your new hobby â€” derivations. With a natural enthusiasm, explain that one of your new hobbies is the background and derivation of names, and politely ask the person to whom you have been introduced if he or she knows anything about the history of his or her own family name. (Be sure to know the history of your own surname!) It may surprise you to know that on average 50 per cent of people not only know at least some part of the background of their families' nomenclature but most of them are enthusiastic about discussing it. Once again you will have confirmed your interest in the individual, as well as having laid the ground for more repetition. 8. Exchange cards. The Japanese have developed card-exchange as a major social function, realising how useful it is for memory. If you are really interested in remembering people's names, make sure you have a very presentable card to give them, and in most cases they will give you their own or write the details down for you. 9. Repetition in Conversation. Carrying the principles of interest, politeness and repetition further, make sure that during conversations with people newly met you repeat their names wherever possible. This repetition helps to implant the name more firmly in your memory, and it is also socially more rewarding, for it involves the other person more intimately in the conversation. It is far more satisfying for them to hear you say, 'Yes, as Mary has just said ...' than to hear you say, 'Yes, as she [as you point] has just said ...' 10. Repeat internally. During any little pause in the conversation, look analytically and with interest at the various people who are speaking and about whom others are speaking, repeating internally to yourself the names that by now will be becoming second nature to you. 11. Check during longer breaks. If you have gone to get a drink for someone or for yourself, or for any other reason are momentarily alone in a crowd, spend that time scanning everyone you have met, repeating to yourself their names, the spelling of their names, any background material you have gathered about the names, plus any other items of interest that have arisen during the conversation. In this way, you will be surrounding each name with associations, thus building up a mapped network in your own mind that will increase the probability of future recall."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"12. Repetition at parting. As you say farewell, make sure you use the name of the person to whom you are saying it. Thus, buy this time you will have used both the primacy and recency time-aspects of memory, having consolidated both your initial and final moments during the 'learning period'. 13. Reviews: a. Mental. When you have parted from the new people, quickly flash through your mind all the names and faces of those you have just met. b. Photographs. When possible (for example, at a party), get photographs (either the formal ones or informal ones) of the event. c. Your names and faces memory diary. If you are interested in becoming a real Master Memoriser of names, keep a special diary in which you quickly sketch and make a Mind Map of the faces of those you have met, the names that attach to them, plus any other Key Image Word information. d. Personal card file. Keep a card file, noting on each card the time, place and date at which you met the person concerned. 14. The Reversal Principle. Wherever possible, reverse the processes through which you have just been. For example, when being introduced, repeat your own name, give the spelling, and if it seems appropriate even give the background. Similarly, make sure you present, where appropriate, your personal card. Throughout conversations, if you are referring to yourself, use your own name. This will help others to remember you, as well as encouraging them to use their names rather than pronouns during the conversations. In addition to being more polite, this approach will make the entire conversation more personal, enjoyable and friendly. 15. Pace yourself. There is a tendency, because of the stress of the initial meeting situation, for everyone to rush through it. The great names-and-faces memorisers and the founders of social etiquette invariably take their time, making sure that they have said at least one personal thing to everyone whom they meet. The Queen is a good example. 16. Have fun. If you make the learning of names and faces a serious and enjoyable game, the right side of your brain will feel far more free and open to make the imaginative associations and connections necessary for good memory. Children have 'better memories' for names and faces than adults nor because their minds are superior but simply because they naturally apply all the principles outlined in this book. 17. The Plus-One Principle. If you would normally remember only between two to five of thirty people you have newly met, as the average person would give yourself the goal of one more than you would normally remember. This establishes in your mind the principle of success and does not place the unnecessary stress of your trying to perfect first time out. Apply the Plus-one Principle each time you are in a new situation and your road to success in the memorisation of names and faces is guaranteed."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Head and Facial Characteristics 1. Head You will usually first meet a person face-to-face, so before dealing with the rundown of separate characteristics, we will consider the head as a whole. Look for the general shape of the entire bone structure. You will find that this can be: a) large; b) medium; or c) small. And that within these three categories the following shapes can be found: a) square; b) rectangular; c) round; d) oval; e) triangular, with the base at the chin and the point at the scalp; f) triangular, with the base at the scalp and the point at the chin; g) broad; h) narrow; i) big-boned; or j) fine-boned. Fairly early in your meeting, you may see the head from the side and will be surprised at how many different shaped heads seen from this view can take: a) square; b) rectangular; c) oval; d) broad; e) narrow; f) round; g) flat at the front; h) flat on top; i) flat at the back; j) domed at the back; k) face angled with jutting chin and slanted forehead; or i) face angled with receding chin and prominent forehead. 2. Hair In earlier days, when hairstyles used to be more consistent and lasting, hair served as a better memory"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"hook than it does now. The advent of dyes, sprays, wigs and almost infinitely varied styles makes identification by this feature a tricky business. Some of the more basic characteristics, however, can be listed as follows. Men: a) thick; b) fine; c) wavy; d) straight; e) parted; f) receding; g) bald; h) cropped; i) medium; j) long; k) frizzy; and l) colour (only in notable cases). Women: a) thick; b) thin; or c) fine. Because of the variability in women's hairstyles it is not advisable to try to remember them from this characteristic. 3. Forehead Foreheads can generally be divided into the following categories: a) high; b) wide; c) narrow between hairline and eyebrows; d) narrow between temple and temple; e) smooth; f) lined horizontally; or g) lined vertically. 4. Eyebrows a) thick; b) thin; c) long; d) short; e) meeting at the middle;"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"f) spaced apart; g) flat; h) arched; i) winged; j) bushy; or k) tapered. 5. Eyelashes a) thick; b) thin; c) long; d) short; e) curled; or f) straight. 6. Eyes a) large; b) small; c) protruding; d) deep-set; e) close together; f) spaced apart; g) slanted outward; h) slanted inward; i) coloured; j) iris â€” entire circle seen; or k) iris â€” circle covered partly by upper and/or lower lid. Attention may also be paid in some cases to the lid above and the bag below the eye, both of which can be large or small, smooth or wrinkled, puffy or firm. 7. Nose When seen from the front: a) large; b) small; c) narrow; d) medium; e) wide; or f) crooked. When seen from the side:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"a) straight; b) flat; c) pointed; d) blunt; e) snub or upturned; f) Roman or aquiline; g) Greek, forming straight line with forehead; or h) concave (caved in).

The nostrils themselves can also vary: a) straight; b) curved down; c) flaring; d) wide; e) narrow; or f) hairy. 8. Cheekbones Cheekbones are often linked very closely with the characteristics of the face when seen front-on, but the following three characteristics are often worth noting: a) high; b) prominent; or c) obscured. 9. Ears Ears are a part of the face that few people pay attention to, and yet their individuality can be greater than any other feature. They may be: a) large; b) small; c) gnarled; d) smooth; e) round; f) oblong;"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"g) triangular; h) flat against the head; i) protruding; j) hairy; k) large-lobed; l) no lobe; or m) uneven. This feature is of course more appropriate as a memory hook with men than with women, because the latter often cover their ears with hair. 10. Lips a) long upper lip; b) short upper lip; c) small; d) thick (bee-stung); e) wide; f) thin; g) upturned; h) down-turned; i) Cupid's bow; j) well-shaped; or k) ill-defined. 11. Chin When seen straight-on, the chin may be: a) long; b) short; c) pointed; d) square; e) round; f) double (or multiple); g) cleft; or h) dimpled. When seen from the side, it will be: a) jutting; b) straight; c) double (or multiple); or d) receding."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"12.

Other characteristics of faces, especially men's, include the various and varied growth of facial hair ranging from short sideburns to the full-blooded and face-concealing beard with moustache. There is no point in listing all the variations. It should suffice to note that these hirsute phenomena do exist, but that they, like hairstyles and colours, can change overnight. The Mnemonic Names and Faces Memory Principles Emphasising: l (1) imagination, and l (2) association. The steps are as follows: 1. Make sure you have a clear mental image of the person's name. 2. Make sure you can actually 'hear again' the sound of the person's name. 3. Very carefully examine the face of the person to whom you are being introduced. 4. Look for facial characteristics that are unusual, extraordinary or unique. 5. Mentally reconstruct the person's face, using your imagination in the way that a cartoonist does to exaggerate any noteworthy features. 6. Associate, using your imagination, exaggeration and the general Memory Principles, any of the outstanding features with the name of the person."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"8 - Discovering The Success Mechanism Within You It may seem strange, but it is nevertheless true that up until ten years ago scientists had no idea of just how the human brain and nervous system worked \"purposely\" or to achieve a goal. They knew what happened from having made long and meticulous observations. But no single theory of underlying principles tied all these phenomena together into a concept that made sense. R.W. Gerard, writing in Scientific Monthly in June, 1946, on the brain and imagination, stated that it was sad but true that most of our understanding of the mind would remain as valid and useful if, for all we knew, the cranium were stuffed with cotton wadding. However, when man himself set out to build an \"electronic brain\", and to construct goal-striving mechanisms of his own, he had to discover and utilise certain basic principles. Having discovered them, these scientists began to ask themselves: Could this be the way that the human brain worked also? Could it be that in making man, our Creator had provided us with a servo-mechanism more marvellous and wonderful than any electronic brain or guidance system ever dreamed of by man, bur operating according to the same basic principles? In the opinion of famous Cybernetic scientists like Dr. Norbert Weiner, Dr. John von Newmann, and others, the answer was an unqualified \"yes\". Your Built-in Guidance System Every living thing has a built-in guidance system or goal-striving device, put there by its Creator to help it achieve its goal â€” which is, in broad terms â€” to \"live\". In the simpler forms of life the goal \"to live\" simply means physical survival for both the individual and the species. The built-in mechanism in animals is limited to finding food and shelter, avoiding or overcoming enemies and hazards, and procreation to insure the survival of the species. In man, the goal \"to live\" means more than mere survival. For an animal to \"live\" simply means that certain physical needs must be met. Man has certain emotional and spiritual needs which animals do not have. Consequently for man to \"live\" encompasses more than physical and survival and procreation of the specie. It requires certain emotional and spiritual satisfaction as well. Man's built in \"Success Mechanism\" also is much broader in scope than an animal's. In addition to helping man avoid or overcome danger, and the \"sexual instinct\" which helps keep the race alive, the Success Mechanism in man can help him get answers to problems, invent, write poetry, run a business, sell merchandise, explore new horizons in science, attain more peace of mind, develop a better personality, or achieve success in any other activity which is intimately tied in to his \"living\" or makes for a fuller life. The Success \"Instinct\" A squirrel does not have to be taught how to gather nuts. Nor does it need to learn that it should store them for winter. A squirrel born in the spring has never experienced winter. Yet in the fall of the year it can be observed busily storing nuts to be eaten during the winter months when there will be no food to be gathered. A bird does not need to take lessons in nest-building."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Nor does it need to take courses in navigation. Yet birds do navigate thousands of miles, sometimes over open sea. They have no newspapers or TV to give them weather reports, no books written by explorer or pioneer birds to map out for them the warm areas of the earth. Nonetheless the bird \"knows\" when cold weather is imminent and the exact location of a warm climate even though it may be thousands of miles away. In attempting to explain such things we usually say that animals have certain \"instincts\" which guide them. Analyse all such instincts and you will find they assist the animal to successfully cope with its environment. In short, animals have a \"success instinct\". We often overlook the fact that man too has a success instinct, much more marvellous and much more complex than that of any animals. Our Creator did not short-change man. On the other hand, man was especially blessed in this regard. Animals cannot select their goals. Their goals (self-preservation and procreation) are pre-set, so to speak. And their success mechanism is limited to these built-in goal-images, which we call \"instincts\". Man, on the other hand, has something animals haven't â€” Creative Imagination. Thus man of all creatures is more than a creature, he is also a creator. With his imagination he can formulate a variety of goals. Man alone can direct his Success Mechanism by the use of imagination, or imaging ability. We often think of \"Creative Imagination\" as applying only to poets, inventors, and the like. But imagination is creative in everything we do. Although they did not understand why, or how imagination sets our creative mechanism into action, serious thinkers of all ages, as well as hard- headed \"practical\" men, have recognised the fact and made use of it. \"Imagination rules the world,\" said Glenn Clark. \"The faculty of imagination is the great spring of human activity, and the principal source of human improvement ... Destroy this faculty, and the condition of man will become as stationary as that of the brutes,\" said Dugold Stewart, the famous Scottish philosopher. \"You can imagine your future,\" says Henry J. Kaiser, who attributes much of his success in business to the constructive, positive use of creative imagination. How Your Success Mechanism Works \"You\" are not a machine. But new discoveries in the science of Cybernetics all point to the conclusion that your physical brain and nervous system make up a servo-mechanism which \"You\" use, and which operates very much like an electronic computer, and a mechanical goal-seeking device. Your brain and nervous system constitute a goal-striving mechanism which operates automatically to achieve a certain goal, very much as a self-aiming torpedo or missile seeks out its target and steers its way to it. Your built-in servo-mechanism functions both as a \"guidance system\" to automatically steer you in the right direction to achieve certain goals, or make correct responses to environment, and also as an \"electronic brain\" which can function automatically to solve problems, give you needed answers, and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"provide new ideas or \"inspirations\". In his book The Computer and the Brain, Dr. John von Newmann says that the human brain possesses the attributes of both the analogue and the digital computer. The word \"Cybernetics\" comes from a Greek word which means literally, \"the steersman\". Servo- mechanisms are so constructed that they automatically \"steer\" their way to a goal, target, or \"answer\". \"Psycho-Cybernetics\" â€” A New Concept Of How Your Brain Works When we conceive of the human brain and nervous system as a form of servo-mechanism, operating in accordance with Cybernetic principles, we gain a new insight into the why and wherefore of human behaviour. I choose to call this new concept \"Psycho-Cybernetics\": the principles of Cybernetics as applied to the human brain. I must repeat. Psycho-Cybernetics does not say that man is a machine. Rather, it says that man has a machine which he uses. Let us examine some of the similarities between mechanical servo- mechanisms and the human brain: The Two General Types Of Servo-Mechanisms Servo-mechanisms are divided into two general types: l (1) where the target, goal, or \"answer\" is known, and the objective is to reach it or accomplish it, and l (2) where the target or \"answer\" is not known and the objective is to discover or locate it. The human brain and nervous system operates in both ways. An example of the first type is the self-guided torpedo, or the interceptor missile. The target or goal is known â€” an enemy ship or plane. The objective is to reach it. Such machines must \"know\" the target they are shooting for. They must have some sort of propulsion system which propels them forward in the general direction of the target. They must be equipped with \"sense organs\" (radar, sonar, heat perceptors, etc.) which bring information from the target. These \"sense organs\" keep the machine informed when it is on the correct course (positive feedback) and when it commits an error and gets off course (negative feedback). The machine does not react or respond to positive feedback. It is doing the correct thing already and \"just keeps on doing what it is doing\". There must be a corrective device, however, which will respond to negative feedback. When negative feedback informs the mechanism that it is \"off the beam\" too far to the right, the corrective mechanism automatically causes the rudder to move so that it will steer the machine back to the left. If it \"over corrects\" and heads too far to the left, this mistake is made known through negative"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"feedback, and the corrective device moves the rudder so it will steer the machine back to the right. The torpedo accomplishes its goal by going forward, making errors, and continually correcting them. By a series of zigzags it literally \"gropes\" its way to the goal. Dr. Norbert Weiner, who pioneered in the development of goal-seeking mechanisms in World War II, believes that something very similar to the foregoing happens in the human nervous system whenever you perform any purposeful activity â€” even in such a simple goal-seeking situation as picking up a package of cigarettes from a table. We are able to accomplish the goal of picking up the cigarettes because of an automatic mechanism, and not by \"will\" and fore-brain thinking alone. All that the fore-brain does is to select the goal, trigger it into action by desire, and feed information to the automatic mechanism so that your hand continually corrects its course. In the first place, said Dr. Weiner, only an anatomist would know all the muscles involved in picking up the cigarettes. And if you knew, you would not consciously say to yourself, \"I must contract my shoulder muscles to elevate my arm, now I must contract by triceps to extend my arm, etc.\" You just go ahead and pick up the cigarettes, and are not conscious of issuing orders to individual muscles, nor of computing just how much contraction is needed. When \"YOU\" select the goal and trigger it into action, an automatic mechanism takes over. First of all, you have picked up cigarettes, or performed similar movements before. Your automatic mechanism has \"learned\" something of the correct response needed. Next, your automatic mechanisms uses feedback data furnished to the brain by your eyes, which tells it \"the degree to which the cigarettes are not picked up\". This feed-back data enables the automatic mechanism to continually correct the motion of your hand, until it is steered to the cigarettes. In a baby, just learning to use its muscles, the correction of the hand in reaching for a rattle is very obvious. The baby has little \"stored information\" to draw upon. Its hand zigzags back and forth and gropes obviously as it reaches. It is characteristic of all learning that as learning takes place, correction becomes more and more refined. We see this in a person just learning to drive a car, who \"over- corrects\" and zigzags back and forth across the street. Once, however, a correct or \"successful response\" has been accomplished â€” it is \"remembered\" for future use. The automatic mechanism then duplicates this successful response on future trials. It has \"learned\" how to respond successfully. It \"remembers\" its successes, forgets its failures, and repeats the successful action without any further conscious \"thought\" â€” or as a habit. How Your Brain Finds Answers to Problems Now let us suppose that the room is dark so that you cannot see the cigarettes. You know, or hope, there is a package of cigarettes on the table, along with a variety of other objects. Instinctively, your hand will begin to \"grope\" back and forth, performing zigzag motions (or \"scanning\") rejecting one"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"object after another, until the cigarettes are found and \"recognised\". This is an example of the second type of servo-mechanism. Recalling a name temporarily forgotten is another example. A \"Scanner\" in your brain scans back through your stored memories until the correct name is \"recognised\". An electronic brain solves problems in much the same way. First of all, a great deal of data must be fed into the machine. This stored, or recorded information is the machine's \"memory\". A problem is posed to the machine. It scans back through its memory until it locates the only \"answer\" which is consistent with and meets all the conditions of the problem. Problem and answer together constitute a \"whole\" situation or structure. When part of the situation or structure (the problem) is given to the machine, it locates the only \"missing parts\" or the right size brick, so to speak, to complete the structure. The more that is learned about the human brain, the more closely it resembles â€” insofar as function is concerned â€” a servo-mechanism. For example, Dr. Wilder Penfield, director of the Montreal Neurological Institute, recently reported at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, that he had discovered a recording mechanism in a small area of the brain, which apparently faithfully records everything that a person has ever experienced, observed or learned. During a brain operation in which the patient was fully awake, Dr. Penfield happened to touch a small area of the cortex with a surgical instrument. At once the patient exclaimed that she was \"reliving\" an incident from her childhood, which she had consciously forgotten. Further experiments along this line brought the same results. When certain areas of the cortex were touched, patients did not merely \"remember\" past experiences, they \"relived\" them, experiencing as very real all the sights, sounds and sensations of the original experience. It was just as if past experiences had been recorded on a tape recorder and played back. Just how a mechanism as small as the human brain can store such a vast amount of information is still a mystery. British neurophysicist W. Grey Walter has said that at least ten billion electronic cells would be needed to build a facsimile of man's brain. These cells would occupy about a million and a half cubic feet, and several additional millions of cubic feet would be needed for the \"nerves\" or wiring. Power required to operate it would be one billion watts. A Look at the Automatic Mechanism in Action We marvel at the awesomeness of interceptor missiles which can compute in a flash the point of interception of another missile and \"be there\" at the correct instant to make contact. Yet, are we not witnessing something just as wonderful each time we see a centre fielder catch a fly ball? In order to compute where the ball will fall, or where the \"point of interception\" will be, he must take into account the speed of the ball, its curvature of fall, its direction, windage, initial velocity and the rate of progressive decrease in velocity. He must make these computations so fast that he will be able to \"take off\" at the crack of the bat."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Next, he must compute just how fast he must run, and in what direction in order to arrive at the point of interception at the same time the ball does. The centre fielder doesn't even think about this. His built- in goal-striving mechanism computes it for him from data which he feeds it through his eyes and ears. The computer in his brain takes this information, compares it with stored data (memories of other successes and failures in catching fly balls). All necessary computations are made in a flash and orders are issued to his leg muscles â€” and he \"just runs\". Science Can Build the Computer but Not the Operator Dr. Weiner has said that at no time in the foreseeable future will scientists be able to construct an electronic brain anywhere near comparable to the human brain. \"I think that our gadget-conscious public has shown an unawareness of the special advantages and special disadvantages of electronic machinery, as compared with the human brain,\" he says. \"The number of switching devices in the human brain vastly exceeds the number in any computing machine yet developed, or even thought of for design in the near future.\" But even should such a machine be built, it would lack an \"operator\". A computer does not have a fore- brain, not an \"I\". It cannot pose problems to itself. It has no imagination and cannot set goals for itself. It cannot determine which goals are worthwhile and which are not. It has no emotions. It cannot \"feel\". It works only on new data fed to it by an operator, by feedback data it secures from its own \"sense organs\" and from information previously stored. Is There an Infinite Storehouse of Ideas, Knowledge, and Power? Many great thinkers of all ages have believed that man's \"stored information\" is not limited to his own memories of past experiences, and learned facts. \"There is one mind common to all individual men,\" said Emerson, who compared our individual minds to the inlets in an ocean of universal mind. Edison believed that he got some of his ideas from a source outside himself. Once, when complimented for a creative idea, he disclaimed credit, saying that \"ideas are in the air\", and if he had not discovered it, someone else would have. Dr. J.B. Rhine, head of Duke University's Parapsychology Laboratory, has proved experimentally that man has access to knowledge, facts, and ideas, other than his own individual memory or stored information from learning or experience. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments. His findings, that man possesses some \"extra sensory factor\", which he calls \"Psi\", are no longer doubted by scientists who have seriously reviewed his work. As Professor R.H. Thouless of Cambridge University says, \"The reality of the phenomena must be regarded as proved as certainly as anything in scientific research can be proved\". \"We have found,\" says Dr. Rhine, \"that there is a capacity for acquiring knowledge that transcends the sensory functions. This extra sensory capacity can give us knowledge certainly of objective and very likely of subjective states, knowledge of matter and most probably of minds.\" Shubert is said to have told a friend that his own creative process consisted in \"remembering a melody\""},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"that neither he nor anyone else had ever thought of before. Many creative artists, as well as psychologists who have made a study of the creative process, have been impressed by the similarity of creative inspiration, sudden revelation, intuition, etc., and ordinary human memory. Searching for a new idea, or an answer to a problem, is in fact, very similar to searching memory for a name you have forgotten. You know that the name is \"there\", or else you would not search. The scanner in your brain scans back over stored memories until the desired name is \"recognised\" or \"discovered\". The Answer Exists Now In much the same way, when we set out to find a new idea, or the answer to a problem, we must assume that the answer exists already â€” somewhere, and set out to find it. Dr. Norbert Wiener has said, \"Once a scientist attacks a problem which he knows to have an answer, his entire attitude is changed. He is already some fifty per cent of his way toward that answer\". (Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings, Houghton Mifflin, New York.) When you set put to do creative work â€” whether in the field of selling, managing a business, writing a sonnet, improving human relations, or whatever, you begin with a goal in mind, an end to be achieved, a \"target\" answer, which, although perhaps somewhat vague, will be \"recognised\" when achieved. If you really mean business, have an intense desire, and begin to think intensely about all angles of the problem â€” your creative mechanism goes to work â€” and the \"scanner\" we spoke of earlier begins to scan back through stored information, or \"grope\" its way to an answer. It selects an idea here, a fact there, a series of former experiences, and relates them â€” or \"ties them together\" into a meaningful whole which will \"fill out\" the incomplete portion of your situation, complete your equation, or \"solve\" your problem. When this solution is served up to your consciousness â€” often at an unguarded moment when you are thinking of something else â€” or perhaps even as a dream while your consciousness is asleep â€” something \"clicks\" and you at once \"recognise\" this as the answer you have been searching for. In this process, does your creative mechanism, also have access to stored information in a universal mind? Numerous experiences of creative workers would seem to indicate that it does. How else, for example, explain the experience of Louis Agassiz, told by his wife: \"He had been striving to decipher the somewhat obscure impression of a fossil fish on the stone slab in which it was preserved. Weary and perplexed, he put his work aside at last and tried to dismiss it from his mind. Shortly after, he woke one night persuaded that while asleep he had seen his fish with all the missing features perfectly restored. \"He went early to the Jardin des Plantes, thinking that on looking anew at the impression he would see something to put him on the track of his vision. In vain â€” the blurred record was as blank as ever. The next night he saw the fish again, but when he woke it disappeared from his memory as before. Hoping"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"the same experience might be repeated, on the third night he placed a pencil and paper beside his bed before going to sleep. \"Towards morning the fish reappeared in his dream, confusedly at first, but at last with such distinctness that he no longer had any doubt as to its zoological characters. Still half dreaming, in perfect darkness, he traced these characters on the sheet of paper at the bedside. \"In the morning he was surprised to see in his nocturnal sketch features which he thought it impossible the fossil itself would reveal. He hastened to the Jardin des Plantes and, with his drawing as a guide, succeeded in chiseling away the surface of the stone under which portions of the fish proved to be hidden. When wholly exposed, the fossil corresponded with his dream and his drawing, and he succeeded in classifying it with ease.\" Practice Exercise No. 1 Get a New Mental Picture of Yourself The unhappy, failure-type personality cannot develop a new self-image by pure will power, or by arbitrarily deciding to. There must be some grounds, some justification, some reason for deciding that the old picture of self is in error, and that a new picture is appropriate. You cannot merely imagine a new self image, unless you feel that it is based upon truth. Experience has shown that when a person does change his self image, he has the feeling that for one reason or another, he \"sees\", or realised the truth about himself. The truth in this chapter can set you free of an old inadequate self-image, if you read it often, think intently about the implications, and \"hammer home\" its truths to yourself. Science has now confirmed what philosophers, mystics, and other intuitive people have long declared: every human being has been literally \"engineered for success\" by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself. This means \"YOU\". As Emerson has said, \"There are no great and no small\". If you were engineered for success and happiness, then the old picture of yourself as unworthy of happiness, of a person who was \"meant\" to fail, must be in error. Read this chapter through at least three times per week for the first 21 days. Study it and digest it. Look for examples in your experiences, and the experiences of your friends, which illustrate the creative mechanism in action. Memorise the following basic principles by which your success mechanism Operates. You do not need to be an electronic engineer, or a physicist, to operate your own servo-mechanism,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"anymore than you have to be able to engineer an automobile in order to drive one, or become an electrical engineer in order to turn on the light in your room. You do need to be familiar with the following, however, because having memorised them, they will throw \"new light\" on what is to follow: 1. Your built-in success mechanism must have a goal or \"target\". This goal, or target, must be conceived of as \"already in existence â€” now\" either in actual or potential form. It operates by either (1) steering you to a goal already in existence or by (2) \"discovering\" something already in existence. 2. The automatic mechanism is teleological, that is, operates, or must be oriented to \"end results\", goals. Do not be discouraged because the \"means whereby\" may not be apparent. It is the function of the automatic mechanism to supply the \"means whereby\" when you supply the goal. Think in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves. 3. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. All servo-mechanisms achieve a goal by negative feed-back, or by going forward, making mistakes, and immediately correcting course. 4. Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a \"successful\" motion, movement or performance has been achieved. Alter that, further learning, and continued success, is accomplished by forgetting the past errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be \"imitated\". 5. You must learn to trust your creative mechanism to do its work and not \"jam it\" by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort. You must \"let it\" work, rather than \"make it\" work. This trust is necessary because your creative mechanism operates below the level of consciousness, and you cannot \"know\" what is going on beneath the surface. Moreover, its nature is to operate spontaneously according to present need. Therefore, you have no guarantees in advance. It comes into operation as you act and as you place a demand upon it by your actions. You must not wait to act until you have proof â€” you must act as if it is there, and it will come through. \"Do the thing and you will have the power,\" said Emerson. By Maxwell Maltz M.D., E.I.C.S. A great contributor to man's knowledge of himself, 1959, U.S.A."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"9 - How To Remember Speeches, Jokes, Books, Poems, Dramatic Parts And Articles Speeches The best way to start approaching the memorisation of speeches is to realise that in 90 per cent of cases they do not need to be completely memorised. Realisation of this fact will instantaneously help you overcome most of the major problems experienced by those who approach speech writing and speech making as memory function: 1. The enormous amount of time wasted in preparing a speech for memorisation. The average time taken for the preparation and presentation of a one-hour speech is, in total, one week. This wasted time is spent writing and rewriting the speech again and again to make it appropriate for memorisation. The remainder of the wasted time is spent trying to ram the speech into the memory by constant repetition. 2. The mental pressure and stress caused. 3. The physical stress resulting from item 2. 4. The relatively stilted presentation that results from a word-for-word memorised presentation. 5. The boredom experienced by the audience who will 'sense' that what they are being given is lineally memorised and rigid, and not spontaneous and immediately relevant to them. 6. The aura of stress in both the speaker and the audience, both of whom wait with apprehension for those horrible gaps and pauses that occur when something has been forgotten. 7. The lack of eye contact between the speaker and the audience because the speaker is 'looking inward' at the rigidly memorised material and not outward to the audience. The secret of making a good speech is not to remember the entire speech word for word, but the main Key Words of your speech. The entire process of preparation and memory/presentation can be made both enjoyable and easy if you follow these simple steps: 1. Generally research the topic about which you are going to speak, making recordings of ideas, quotations and references that you think will prove relevant. 2. Having completed your basic research, sit down and plan out, using a Mind Map, the basic structure of your presentation. 3. With your basic structure in front of you, fill in any important details, still in Mind Map form, so that you have completed a left and right brain, associative, imagistic Mind Map Memory Note of the entire speech. Usually this will contain no more than 100 words."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"4. Practise making your speech from this completed outline. You will find that, as you practise, the final order in which you wish to present the speech will become increasingly clear, and you can number the main areas and subtitles of your speech appropriately. You will also find that, having completed the research and thought in this way about the structure of the material, you will already have automatically memorised the bulk of your speech. Initially, of course, there will be points in it at which you will hesitate or get lost, but with a little practice you will find that you not only know your speech from beginning to end but know, at a much deeper level than most speakers, the real associations, connections and deeper structures of your speech. In other words, you will really know what you are talking about. This point is especially important, for it means that when you finally do speak to your audience, you will have no fear of forgetting the word order of what you are presenting. You will simply say what you have to say smoothly, using the vocabulary appropriate for the moment and not getting bogged down in a rigid succession of preordained sentence structures. You will thus become a creative and dynamic speaker. 5. Select the ten, twenty or thirty Key Words that completely summarize your speech and use the Basic Memory Principles to connect your speech. Don't worry about any little pauses that might occur in your speech. When an audience senses that a speaker knows what he or she is talking about, a pause is actually more positive than negative, for it makes it obvious to the audience that the speaker is actually thinking and creating on the platform. This adds to the enjoyment of listening, for it makes the presentation far less formal and more personal and natural. Some great speakers actually use the pause as a technique, maintaining electrifying 'thinking silences' of up to as much as a full minute. In those very rare instances when you do have to memorise an entire speech word for word, the process can be made easy by applying everything discussed so far in relation to speeches, and then, for the finishing touches, applying the techniques outlined in Dramatic Parts and Poems in this chapter. Jokes The problems and embarrassments associated with the memorisation and the telling of jokes are almost endless. In recent studies of business people and students, it was found that of the thousands of people questioned, nearly 80 per cent thought of themselves as not particularly good joke tellers, all wanted to be good joke tellers, and all listed memory as their major obstacle. The memorisation of jokes is actually far easier to deal with than the memorisation of speeches because the entire creative aspect of the work has already been done for you. The solution is in two parts: first, to establish a basic grid to categorise and capture the main element of the joke; and second, to remember the main details. The first of these areas is easily dealt with by using a section of the Major System as a permanent library for the jokes you wish to file. First, divide the kind of jokes you wish to tell into general categories. For example:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Sexual jokes Animal jokes National jokes (Irish, Japanese, etc.) Rhyming jokes Toilet jokes Kids' jokes 'Intellectual' jokes 'Saying' jokes Sport jokes, etc. List them in numerical preference order and then devote sections of your Major System to these categories. For example, you might have the area from 1 to 10 or 1 to 20 for sexual jokes, the numbers from 10 to 20 or 20 to 40 for national jokes, and so on. The second area is equally easy to handle. Let us take, for example, the joke about the man who went into a pub and bought a pint of beer. Having been given his beer, he suddenly realised he had to make an urgent telephone call, but he knew that some of the characters in the pub would swipe his pint before he returned. In order to prevent this, he wrote on the glass, 'I am the world's karate champion', and went to make his telephone call, securely thinking that his beer was safe. When he returned, he immediately saw that his glass was empty, and he noticed more scribbling underneath his own. It read: Thanks for the pint â€” the world's fastest runner!' To remember the joke, you consciously select Major Key Words from it, joining them to form the basic narrative. All you need from this entire joke are the Key Memory Words: 'pint', 'phone', 'karate champion' and 'running champion'. To complete your memorisation, you imaginatively link the first Key Word to the appropriate Key Word in the Major System, and you use the Link System to connect the remaining three Key Memory Words. There are two major advantages to using this system: first, you will be able to remember clearly and categorise whatever jokes you wish; and second, the mass involvement of your right brain in the memorisation of the joke itself will make you a far more creative and imaginative joke teller, thus overcoming the second major problem for jokers, that of getting in a too rigid and linear, left- brained memorisation mode, which bores the listener. Dramatic Parts and Poems For the university student, school child and professional or amateur actor, this aspect of memory can be the most troublesome of all. The method usually recommended and employed is to read a line over and over again, 'get it'; read the next line, 'get it'; join the two together, 'get them'; read the next line and so on and so on ad nauseam until the first lines have been forgotten. Systems based on the Memory Principles and used successfully by famous actors and actresses are the reverse. In this system the material to be remembered is read and reread quickly (see Speed Reading) and with understanding over a period of four days, approximately five to ten times per day."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"If you read for understanding continually in this way, you will become far more familiar with the material than you realise at the end of the twentieth reading, and you will be able to recall, without looking at the text, most of the material to be remembered. Your mind, especially if you have used your right-brain imagination to help you understand, will have absorbed practically 90 per cent of the information, and remembering will have become a natural outgrowth of proper reading and basic understanding using the tools of imagination and association. This system is far more successful than the line-by-line repetition system, and it can be improved upon even further in the following way: once again you use Key Memory Words. For example, if the material to be remembered is poetry, a few Major Key Words will help your mind 'fill in' the remaining word-gaps. If the material to be remembered is part of a script, once again the Key Memory Image Words and Link Systems prove essential. The basic subdivisions of a long speech can be strung together with Key-Word ease, and cues from speaker to speaker can be handled far more effectively if you imaginatively mnemonicise the quantum leap between the previous speaker's last word and your next word. It is lack of the use of these mnemonic techniques that often cause chaos on the stage, especially those long silences and breaks in continuity that occur when one performer forgets his last word or another forgets his first. Acting troupes can save as much as 50 per cent of their time, and thus enormously reduce stress and increase enjoyment and efficiency, but applying the Basic Memory Principles to the theatrical works in which they are involved. Articles You may need to remember the content of articles on a short-term or long-term basis, and the systems for remembering each are different. If you have to attend a meeting or make a brief resume of an article you have only recently read, you can remember it almost totally, and at the same time can astound your listeners, by remembering the pages to which you are referring. The method is simple: take one, two or three Key Memory Image Words from each page of the article and slot them on to one of your basic Memory Systems. If there is only one Key Memory Image Word per page, you will know that when you are down to Key Memory Image Word number five in your system, you are referring to the fifth page of the article, whereas if there are two ideas per page and you are at Memory Word seven, you will know you are at the top of page four. For the memorisation of an article over a long period of time, it will be necessary for you to choose more than two or three Key Memory Image Words per page. Books It is possible to memorise, in detail, an entire book! You simply apply the memory techniques for articles to each page of the book you wish to remember. Simply take one, two or three Key Memory Image Words for page one and creatively link them to your Major System Memory Word for number 1: tea. From page two you select another one, two or three Key Memory Image Words, creatively linking them to your number 2 Major System Key Memory Word: Noah, and so on. It will thus be possible for you, in a 300-page book, to remember not only what the basic content of each page was"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"but, if you wish, what each section of each page contained. You need no longer fear examinations: 1. No more the year-long dread that increasingly looms like a storm on the approaching horizon as the year progresses. 2. No longer the frantic, rushed, sweaty, frightening final few weeks' and days' buildup of tension before the event. 3. No longer the stressful dash into the examination room in order to save every available second. 4. No longer the nervous first rush through the examination paper, during which you read so fast that you have to read it again to find out what is actually being asked. 5. No longer will you need to spend as much as fifteen to thirty minutes of a one-hour examination jotting down random notes, scratching your head, frowning, frantically trying to recall all that you know and yet at the moment for some reason seem not to remember. 6. No longer the frustration of not being able to dig out the essence from the mire of your generally disorganised knowledge. The common scenario suggested above applies not only to those who know little about the subject but often to those who have a great deal of knowledge. I remember at least three students in my undergraduate years who knew more about certain subjects than practically everyone else in the year and who consequently used to give private tutoring and coaching to those who were struggling. Extraordinarily, these bright students would regularly fail to excel at examination time, invariably complaining that they had not had enough time in the examination room to gather together the mass of knowledge that they had and that for some reason they 'forgot' at critical moments. All these problems can be overcome by preparing for examinations using the techniques for reading and studying outlined in Use Your Head and Speed Reading. Assume, for example, that the subject you wish to study and prepare to be examined in is psychology. As you study and organise your notes throughout the year, you would consciously and continually build up categories (much as you did when remembering jokes) that contain all the sub categories of the information. In psychology these categories might include the following: 1. Major headings 2. Major theories 3. Important experiments 4. Significant lectures 5. Important books 6. Important papers 7. General significant points 8. Personal insights, thoughts and theories"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Using the major System you would allot a certain section to each of these major headings, attaching the Key Memory Image Words from your subjects to the appropriate Major System or Key Memory Image Word. For example, if you had devoted the numbers 30 to 50 to important psychological experiments, and the fifth of these was an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B.F. Skinner in which pigeons learned to peck for the reward of grain, you would imagine an enormous suit of armour (mail) taking the place of the skin (Skinner) of a giant and warrior like pigeon who was pecking at the sun, causing millions of tons of grain to pour from heaven. Using this approach, you will find it possible to contain an entire year's study within the numbers 1 to 100 and to transmit this organised and well-understood knowledge into flowing, first-class examination papers. If, for example, you were asked, in your psychology exam, to discuss motivation and learning with reference to behavioural psychology, you would pick the Key Words from the question and run them down your Major System Memory Grid, pulling out any items that were in any way relevant to the question. Thus, the general form of your opening paragraph might be as follows: In discussing the question of 'motivation and learning with reference to behavioural psychology', I wish to consider the following main areas of psychology: blank, blank and blank; the following give theories: blank, blank and blank; the following three experiments, which support hypothesis A: blank, blank and blank; the following two experiments, which support hypothesis B: blank and blank; and the following five experiments, which support hypothesis C: blank, blank, blank, blank and blank. In discussing the above, I wish to quote from the following books: blank, blank and blank; make reference to papers by blank, blank, blank, blank, blank and blank; include further references from course lectures given by blank on the following subjects: blank, blank, blank and blank; on the following dates: blank, blank, blank and blank. As you can see, you are already well on the way to a good grade, and at this stage you are still breezing through the introduction to your answer) It is worth emphasising that in any subject area the last category in your Memory System should be for your own creative and original ideas. It is in this category that the difference between first-and second-class examination results lies. Besides being able to remember information perfectly for examinations, by using the systems outlined in this book, you will also be cultivating the creative powers of your mind that lead to your complete success. Remembering Mind Maps Most people forget what they note because they use only a tiny fraction of their brain in the note- taking process. Standard note-taking systems use sentences, phrases, lists and lines, and numbers. Such systems use only the left-brained Basic Memory Principles of order, sequence and number, leaving out imagination, association, exaggeration, contraction, absurdity, humour, colour, rhythm, the senses, sexuality and sensuality. In order to make notes well, you have to break with tradition and use both the left and right sides of"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"your brain, as well as all the fundamental Memory Principles. In this system of note taking, you use blank unlined pages, using a Key Memory Image (right brain) that summarises the central theme of the note you are making. From this central image you have a series of connecting lines (left brain) on which are written (left brain) or drawn (right brain) the Key Image Words or actual images themselves of the main sub-areas and sub-themes you wish to note. Connected to these lines are more lines, again on which you place Key Image Words or Key Images themselves. In this way you build up a multidimensional, associative, imaginative and colourful Mind Map Memory Note of everything you wish to note. Noting in this way, you will not only remember almost immediately and totally everything you write down because of the application of all the Memory Principles to this new multidimensionally mnemonic note-taking approach but you will also find that the approach allows you to understand, analyse and think critically about whatever it is you are noting, while at the same time it gives you more time to pay attention to either the lecturer or the book from which you are learning."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"10 - For A Clear Memory You Must Stop Emotional Disorders The use of nutritional therapy to treat emotional distress is new. It seems to be almost \"magical\" in its accomplishments, yet it is surprisingly simple. More and more physicians are prescribing nutritional programs for mental ills. They report that emotional disorders, ranging from ordinary \"daily tension\" to \"chronic depression\", have responded with remarkable benefits. In many instances, just one special nutrient has helped bring about a dramatic recovery from a so-called \"incurable\" emotional illness. In other situations, special all- nutritional programs, followed over a period of time, produced amazing results. The unique benefit of nutritional therapy is that it treats the cause first and the symptoms second. Evidence is being accumulated by qualified research personnel that the entire body must be taken into consideration when treating any ailment. Nutritional therapy is directed at healing the body, so healing the cause. The symptoms, hopefully, subside and the mental outlook becomes more optimistic. How This Book Will Help You. Research reports of physicians and others indicate that natural (unrefined) food, special foods, natural food aids, more vitamin-mineral-protein-enzyme packed foods â€” all can help build up the body to such a state of health that many nervous ailments slowly melt away. It isn't meant to suggest that all emotional illness can be cured overnight through nutrition. The hope here is that those who are troubled by such disorders can see the possibility of better health through better foods â€” proper and healthful nutrition. The secret of the success of nutritional therapy is that it does not separate the mind from the body. You cannot separate them â€” they are one! If the body is in proper working order then the mind works properly. But on the other hand, the brain becomes disturbed if its physical mechanism, the nervous system, is disturbed by physical and/or biochemical changes. The common sense approach in nutritional therapy is that a healthy nervous system will promote a healthy mental state. Emotional illness may arise in the body, not, necessarily, in the mind. An emotional upset triggers off a physiological imbalance that is felt in the mind. When treatment begins with healing the nervous system, then the mental system has a better chance of recovery than if treated apart from the rest of the body. Feed Your Brain-Nerve Cells For Healthy Emotions. Your body is made up of millions of cells, tissues and other vital organs. These must be constantly nourished by raw materials that will give them the ingredients they need to live and carry on during the lifespan. Your brain is a powerhouse of nerve cells. There are nerve centres in the brain that control regulatory or automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, blood circulation, and thinking. Every move and every thought is governed by these brain-nerve cells. They need nourishment just like other body cells."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Through metabolism, the body supplies the brain with the fuel it needs from foods taken in. The B- complex vitamins especially are known as being valuable \"brain food\". Dr. Roger J. Williams, author of Nutrition in a Nutshell, singles out thiamine (B1), niacin, B12 and pantothenic acid as the specifics of the Vitamin B-complex family that help nourish the brain-nerve cells. Without these, the nerve cells develop severe functional abnormalities ... \"Failure of cells in one area to get what they need can cause severe damage elsewhere in the body,\" says Dr. Williams. Good sources of the Vitamin B-complex group include whole-grain, unprocessed wheat products, meat, eggs, dried beans and peas, natural and organic nut butters of all types, whole-grain cereals. Niacin, or Vitamin B3, is especially healing to the mind. Niacin helps invigorate the brain-nerve system and helps cells metabolise other nutrients that feed the brain. Good niacin sources are organic peanut butter, meat, fish, poultry and unbleached and unprocessed whole grain bread and cereal products. Special niacin food supplements are available, and you may discuss their use with your physician. Dr. Williams states that niacin is \"absolutely essential for brain metabolism\". Many \"average\" emotional disorders are reported to have responded and been gradually corrected through special nutritional programs. This is encouraging when we consider that the brain and the nervous system â€” along with all other parts of the body â€” must do their work using whatever is available to them in the way of vitamins, minerals, proteins, enzymes, and so on. The following checklist shows how closely the health of the brain-nervous system and body are related to nutrition: Increased Mental Energy. The B-complex vitamins were given to a group of patients who had problems of mental depression, sluggish intelligence, poor judgment. After a period of time, these patients reportedly responded with better mental health. D.G. Campbell, M.D., in Modem Nutrition in Health and Disease, reports that the nervous system is more sensitive to nutritional variance than any other part of the body. He says the unique benefit of the B-complex group is its ability of making carbohydrate food available to the nerves for mental energy. He also emphasises the value of minerals to nourish nervous tissues. Thiamine Intelligence Boost. Three researchers reported in the Bulletin of the Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic, on emotionally disturbed patients with problems of behaviour. The subjects were unable to concentrate, suffered from confusion of thought and poor memory. All were irritable, depressed, quarrelsome, unco-operative and fearful of some impending disaster. Two threatened suicide. All had lost their manual dexterity, had headaches, chronic insomnia, were ultra-sensitive to noise, and the women had painful monthly periods. But when the doctors gave them high dosages of thiamine, these symptoms subsided. The patients experienced emotional relief and an increase of basic intelligence. Many could even be"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"considered \"cured!\" Personality Brightener. A group of mental patients were given extra thiamine at an Illinois hospital. Benefit? Attention span, interest, ambition, playfulness, sociability, speed and manual dexterity all got a boost. According to the National Research Council Bulletin, thiamine helped the patients develop a cheerful personality. A timid, depressed person can actually be transformed into a pleasant, personable individual with the help of thiamine. So claims Tom D. Spies, M.D., who reported, in the Association for Research on Nervous Disorders, that administering thiamine to 115 of his moody, depressed patients brought about a personality-intelligence improvement within 30 minutes to 20 hours of administration. Vague Emotional Distress. Neurasthenia (mild mental disorder) is the condition first observed in youngsters whose diets are low in thiamine. This was noted by I.N. Kugelmass, M.D., in the American Journal of Digestive Diseases. Symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, irritability, forgetfulness, headaches, impaired judgment, bodily complaints, hyper sensitivity, frustration and sleeplessness. Dr. Kugelmass states that a food program reinforced with thiamine as a supplement, improves (though it does not always cure) the condition. He compares the preceding symptoms and actual, real, diagnosed mental illness. Emotions Need Nutrition As Much As The Body. Because the nervous cells are more sensitive to a disturbance of the nutrition and oxygen supplies than other cells, a nutritional deficiency often shows up first as an emotional disorder. Specialist V.P. Sydenstricker, M.D., writing in the Annals of Internal Medicine, says that any or all of these symptoms may come first, long before there are any other indications of diet deficiency: Loss of memory for recent events (often seen in older folks who ordinarily can remember well events of bygone years); insomnia; anxiety; apprehension; distractibility, also partial deafness with emphasis upon loss of hearing of high tones; digestive disturbances. Such distress signals should be reported to a physician. Dr. Sydenstricker calls for the utilisation of corrective food programs to help ease such nutrition-based emotional disorders. Niacin For Happy Youngsters. Dr. Tom spies tens of 195 children suffering from pellagra (a disease of Vitamin B deficiency) who displayed these emotional-physical conditions: they were irritable, easily frightened, fretful, crying a good deal, listless, tiring quickly, apprehensive, had poor appetite. Dr. Spies writes in the Journal of the American Medical Association, that when he gave the youngsters brewer's yeast, as well as a niacin supplement, they responded almost immediately. Following corrective food programs that included these supplements, they became happy youngsters"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"again. Pantothenic Acid And Personality. Four men were placed on a diet deficient in pantothenic acid, another of the B-complex group. In two weeks, they were fatigued, wanted to sleep during the day. By the third week, they had lost their appetite and suffered from constipation. By the end of the fourth week, they were quarrelsome, discontented and irascible. They also suffered from burning feet! According to a physicians' report in the Proceedings of the Society of Experimental Biology, when these patients were given supplements of B complex â€”especially pantothenic acidâ€” they experienced a remarkable recovery. In particular, they all showed an improved personality. Nervous Symptoms And Calcium. Calcium deficiency is nearly always related to the instability of the nervous system. This valuable mineral helps transmit impulses along nerves. According to the Physiological Basis of Medical Practice, by Drs. Best and Taylor, calcium deficiency leads to nervous disorders. Possible treatment â€” but only on a doctor's orders! â€” is to take calcium tablets or select such natural food sources of calcium as milk, cheese (but remember there is less calcium in cottage cheese) turnip greens, collards, kale and broccoli. Nervous Tension, Insomnia And Leg Cramps. Pregnant women (and non-pregnant women and men, too) often suffer from these emotional-related problems. \"Other symptoms which are often intensified,\" says Adelle Davis, in Let's Have Healthy Children, \"are a tendency to become more high-strung, inability to sleep soundly and perhaps cramps in the calves of the legs, particularly during the night... These abnormalities occur when calcium is under-supplied or is poorly absorbed.\" Nutrition expert Davis offers this easy to follow calcium program if your doctor approves: \"If you drink daily one quart of skim milk fortified with powdered milk, and if you take calcium tablets before meals, the nervousness, insomnia and leg cramps resulting from calcium deficiency will probably soon disappear. When sleeplessness and nocturnal leg cramps are problems, it is often wise to take calcium tablets just before retiring; keep the tablets by the bedside and take more during the night if wakeful or if leg cramps recur.\" How A Vitamin Can Help Ease Simple Neuritis. Because so many severe emotional upsets start with \"simple neuritis\", it is vital to seek help for this problem as soon as possible. Adelle Davis says, \"Usually, neuritis is corrected as soon as Vitamin B1 is added generously to the diet. Neuritis starts with fatigue and an 'all-gone' feeling. Recurring"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"numbness and vague, fleeting pains may be felt in the hands, feet, and shoulders\". Symptoms: \"The hands and feet 'go to sleep' easily, and a prickling needles-and-pins sensation is often noticed. As neuritis becomes more severe, steady pain follows the nerve channels and may become excruciating indeed\". Treatment: \"Physicians usually treat neuritis by giving injections of Vitamin B1, which often brings immediate relief. Since much of the vitamin is lost in the urine within a few hours, however, the pain may soon recur\", warns nutritionist Adelle Davis. \"In addition to the injections, many doctors advise their patients to take 5-milligram tablets of Vitamin B1 by mouth every 2 or 3 hours â€” the frequency depending upon the severity of the pain â€” until the neuritis disappears. Research has consistently shown that better results are obtained when foods rich in alt the B-complex vitamins are eaten in addition to the taking of Vitamin B1 injections or tablets\". Special B-Complex foods include whole grain bread and cereal products, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk, liver. Nutritionists advise emphasising whole grain and unbleached wheat products. Nutrition And Mental Confusion. A physician, writing in the British Medical Journal tells of a 71-year-old man who had an arthritic condition, but had rarely been seriously ill before that. The physician made a house call, found the patient in bed. The man was confused: he was unable to speak coherently, he could not find the bathroom, and he was unable to put on his clothes. This was a serious case of mental confusion that might have been wrongly diagnosed as \"senility\" if the physician hadn't tried nutrition therapy. The doctor prescribed 50 milligrams tablets of niacin three times a day. Result? The elderly patient improved steadily and in one month had completely recovered. But he grew overconfident, discontinued the niacin tablets and suffered a relapse. When the physician came, he found the patient in the earlier confused state. Once again, the niacin program was put into effect. The man recovered in seven days. He has been well ever since. The physician notes, \"Perhaps from this can be deduced that some cases of senile dementia will respond dramatically to concentrated Vitamin B therapy\". Vitamin-Mineral Therapy Promotes Mental Healing: A comprehensive vitamin-mineral-protein-enzyme food supplement was developed by physicians and given to a group of 19 emotionally disturbed patients. Here is a sampling of the results of the experiment as reported in the Journal of Psychology, by George Watson, M.D. â€” the nature of each patient's illness and how this vitamin-mineral supplement affected it: Depressed Young Man. At 19, he developed a psychosis because of a facial dermatitis. He remained secluded in his room. He did not talk to his family, was unable to meet anyone. He was given this special all-purpose multiple"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"food supplement to be taken daily. Results? In one month, he felt at ease. He joined his family to watch TV. He had talks with his father. His mother told the doctor, \"His recovery, frankly, is more than we had hoped for''. His score in the psychological test given at the end of the treatment was normal. Nutritional therapy had made him \"alive\" again. Emotionally Frustrated. A 42-year-old woman said she felt frustrated, depressed and basically inadequate. She did not look for a job for several years. She displayed symptoms of mental confusion and spoke with a slow, childlike voice pattern. She was given 30 days of the special nutritional supplement. Result? In one month, her voice pattern was normal. She went to school for special courses, appeared to be more alert. Two months of the nutritional therapy and she had found a job. She was calm and relaxed. Her score in the psychological test was also most satisfactory. Delusions-Hostilities-Hatreds. At age 53, this woman had delusions, appeared hostile and filled with hatred. She had fits of temper. She had attempted to run away from her home and family. Her family doctor had treated her with a tranquillizer for six months. She was excitable and always hungry. Dr. Watson prescribed the vitamin-mineral therapy capsule. Result? In one month, she was no longer irritable and impatient. In two months, her family reported that she was no longer aggressive and that her appetite was normal. In four months she was considered clinically normal and secured a position as a saleslady in a department store. Violent Enough to Smash TV Set. The most startling case in this report is that of a 26-year-old man who was so easily enraged he tried to smash the TV set when his father calmly told him to change the station. He displayed symptoms of hostility and some depression. The same vitamin-mineral supplement was given in his case. In a few weeks he was vastly improved. He wanted to find a job where before he had showed little interest in anything. When the supplementation for some reason was stopped, the patient regressed. He became irritable and his temper attacks increased; he was inactive and groggy most of the time. He lost interest in his surroundings and became forgetful, confused. When nutritional therapy was resumed, he improved immeasurably. Result: He soon sought work and was able to get a job without the aid of his family. Nutrition And Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is the most common emotional illness encountered. What is usually referred to as \"split personality\" actually encompasses a whole class of emotional upsets which are grouped together as psychoses. There is increasing indication that schizophrenia can be relieved â€”even healedâ€” through proper nutrition. The basic problem with schizophrenia is that it develops gradually with a few noticeable symptoms. Untreated it may get worse."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"One dramatic case history is that of a newspaperman, Gregory Stefan, who tells of his battles with schizophrenia and its conquest through nutrition in his book, In Search of Sanity. Originally, Gregory was happy, well adjusted, married to a devoted wife. Then he started to feel strange. He estimates it as three years before being \"... vaguely aware of a change in my physical condition\". Gregory was tired all the time. He was tired after resting and sleep. He developed insomnia. He had vague aches and pains. His nerves were raw. He had the impulse to run and run and run. His heart would palpitate. His hands would shake uncontrollably. He was unable to relate to his wife. A physical examination revealed nothing wrong. Now Gregory began imagining all sorts of things, and his symptoms got worse. He had seizures, fainting spells, crying spells. These usually occurred in the late morning or late afternoon. Gregory was tortured by tension, fear, hallucinations. One moment he wanted to commit suicide; the next, he wanted to live. He was plagued with thoughts of killing his wife! At this point, he was placed in a mental hospital where he remained for four years! Shock treatments, tranquillizers, nerve medicine, sleeping pills, barbiturates â€” nothing brought him relief. Even psychiatric sessions were useless. Still his behaviour improved so he was able to eventually leave the hospital. He was still just as sick but less violent. By now Gregory was still just as sick but less violent. By now Gregory was completely defeated. Because he knew he had schizophrenia, Gregory read avidly everything about the subject. Finally he heard of physicians who treated the illness with niacin and sought them out. These doctors told him that they believed schizophrenia to be a physical illness: \"caused by an error in metabolism, probably genetic, that results in the production of a brain poison\". Gregory was given massive doses of niacin. In a short time, he was improved and before long was pronounced well. Says Gregory Stefan: \"I am more appreciative now ... to the delicate relationship between mind and body, and can understand why Hippocrates, in his dealings with the ill, insisted on treating both mind and body simultaneously\". Children And Nutrition Therapy There is no doubt protein is important, but protein is not the only nutrient affecting mental development, nor is it the only one of which malnourished children fail to get enough\". So spoke A. A. Pokrovsky, M.D., at the International Conference on Malnutrition, Learning and Behaviour at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"Even though not every nutrient is directly involved in the development of the nervous system, malnutrition of any type will cause malfunctioning of the metabolism and that will affect the health and abilities of the brain\". Dr. Pokrovsky suggests niacin as well as protein be given to youngsters who are mentally sluggish or display below-average intellect while exhibiting no organic defects."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Elderly Need Better Diet. The mental condition of elderly patients improved when multi-vitamin supplements were given to them. Drs. Franklin I. Shuman and Ronald I. Goldberg, writing in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society tell of helping to mentally rejuvenate 66 out of 100 patients with such a multi- vitamin and mineral food supplement. \"The geriatric patient is prone to use an abnormal diet (that is, soup and crackers) and as such is subject to the development of vitamin deficiencies. \"It is therefore important that any therapeutic agent for the treatment of senility should contain a high- potency preparation.\" The senile man or woman may be deficient in Vitamin C, and doctor-prescribed treatments may help control and relieve the problem. P. Berkenau, M.D. writes in the Journal of Mental Science that he tested a group of senile patients against those who were mentally alert and noted that the senile patients suffered from serious Vitamin C deficiency. He was able to counteract this condition by administering large doses of the vitamin. A deficiency of 1000 to 1500 milligrams of Vitamin C is regarded as emotionally hazardous. The doctor's oldsters had shortages of anywhere from 1400 to 3000 milligrams! C. Milner, M.D., in the British Journal of Psychiatry, also tells of a low Vitamin C content in the bloodstream of 40 senile and \"mentally ill\" patients. For three weeks, he gave each patient 1000 milligrams of Vitamin C daily. Result: relief of depressive manic and paranoid symptoms. Dr. Milner says it takes from 24 to 48 hours to saturate the tissues of a normal person with Vitamin C therapy; in the senile, it may take longer. He adds that, \"Psychiatric patients are shown to have an unusually high demand for Vitamin C\". British Clinical Physiology (Spring 1964) reports on 40 senile patients \"saturated\" with Vitamin C all of whom showed improvement. Doctors in this experiment also concluded that persons with emotional upsets have a high demand for Vitamin C. In foods, Vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) is found in citrus fruits â€” oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes. It is also found in strawberries, cantaloupes, tomatoes, green peppers, broccoli, raw greens, cabbage and potatoes. Fresh citrus fruit drinks are the best and tastiest way to obtain Vitamin C, but check with your doctor about proper dosage. How To \"Grow Young With The Years\". With a well-balanced diet and natural foods, it's possible to grow young with the years. We agree with Nathan W. Schock, M.D., head of the Gerontology Branch of the National Heart Institute, who said: \"Old people show more variety in their ability and physical powers than any other age group. We've found that the ability to do a job â€” except for one that requires unusual strength or dexterity â€” rarely depends on age alone. The mental process does not necessarily dim with age. Those who think more"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"and work more retain their alertness and working ability the longest. \"When we see people who slow down with their years, they are not showing the effect of time itself, they are suffering from the cumulative effects of a lifetime of traumas that literally have wiped out a part of the individual. We hope to find a way to avoid such tragedy.\" Perhaps nutritional therapy may well be the way. Mental Illness And Nutrition. Millions of Americans â€”the estimate is one out of every 10â€” have some form of mental or emotional illness. Each year, close to 3,000,000 people are treated. There are more patients in hospitals receiving treatment for mental disorders than any other illness. Here are some other facts that should alert the public to the need for finding some way to help control and relieve this growing problem: (1) There are close to one million persons in hospitals with mental illnesses. (2) Each year, a half-million persons are admitted to public and private mental hospitals for the first time. (3) It is said that 5 out of every 10 people treated by private doctors and hospitals show a mental illness problem. (4) About one out of every 10 public school children shows emotional upset in need of treatment. There are 250,000 youngsters with less serious disorders who receive help each year at mental health clinics. Well over a half-million youngsters are brought before the courts each year for the kinds of anti-social acts we associate with juvenile delinquency. Many of the youngsters are suffering from emotional disorders which are reflected in their behaviour. Observers have noted with concern the incidence of suicide among adolescents. (5) Outpatient psychiatric clinics in the U.S. serve more persons in the 10 to 19 age group than in any other age group. Three Basic Types Of Emotional Upsets. Emotional upsets may be broadly classified under three basic headings: (1) The Neuroses. Less severe, the neuroses may permit a person to go to work daily. But some neuroses are more disabling than others. The neurotic person suffers from \"anxiety\", a constant feeling of dread and indecision, of being unsettled and distracted. This anxiety may manifest itself in depression, phobias, repetitive thoughts and acts and other such symptoms."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"(2) The Psychotic. The psychotic may be aware of his environment. Although he may be unable to deal with it satisfactorily, he is able to recognise and identify it. In more severe situations, the psychotic substitutes an unreal world of his own making and reacts to that safe and secure world rather than to the real world around him. (3) Personality Disorders. These are difficulties in adjustment that manifest themselves in disturbed behaviour, such as we see in the drug addict, the chronic alcoholic and the delinquent. Hypertension, peptic ulcers and ulcerative colitis are frequently associated with this type of disorder. There can be overlapping of these three basic types and a blurring of differences as well. The physician is the only one who can make the diagnosis, and determine if nutritional therapy can be of help. The Nine Advance Warning Signals Of Possible Emotional Upset. Because emotional upset can sneak up on an individual, it is important to heed Nature's warning signals. Here is a list suggested by the National Association for Mental Health. Of course, these can be present in persons who are well, but overworked, tired, or in the midst of a crisis. But if the symptoms keep recurring, they should be brought to the attention of a physician: (1) Belligerence. Walking around continuously with a chip on the shoulder, ready to argue or quarrel at the slightest excuse â€” or no excuse at all. (2) Excessive Moodiness. Spells of \"the blues\" or \"feeling down in the dumps\", feeling a great deal of the time that \"nothing is worthwhile or really matters\". (3) Exaggerated Worry. Continuous anxiety about nothing at all, or entirely out of proportion to the cause. (4) Suspicion and Mistrust. A persistent feeling that the world is full of dishonest, conniving people; that \"everyone is trying to take advantage of me\". (5) Selfishness and Greediness. Lack of consideration of the needs of others, a \"what's in it for me attitude\" about almost everything. (6) Helplessness and Dependency. A tendency to let others carry the burden, difficulty in making decisions. (7) Poor Emotional Control. Exaggerated emotional outbursts out of proportion to the cause and at inappropriate times."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"(8) Day-dreaming and Fantasy. Spending a good part of the time imagining \"how things could be\" rather than dealing with them as they are. (9) Hypochondria. Worrying a great deal of the time about minor physical ailments; experiencing imaginary symptoms of illness. Don't panic if you notice any of these symptoms since, singly or together, they may happen to anyone in certain situations. Go see your doctor. Let him decide if you need any treatment. Research studies and case histories indicate that wholesome, natural foods can build mental and physical health. Taking any massive vitamin or mineral doses, however, is inadvisable unless the doctor prescribes it. Meanwhile, you can help improve your health with fresh fruits and vegetables, organic meats, fish, eggs, nuts and other seeds. Go easy on pastries, sweets, salted foods and all other artificial foods. To boost your nutritional store-bank, emphasise Brewer's Yeast and desiccated liver (available at health food stores) for the B-complex vitamins as well as minerals, protein and iron. Select organ meats, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, and other whole foods which are prime sources of healthful nutrients. The healthful functioning of the body and of the peripheral and central nervous systems depends upon adequate nutrition. Boost your health and meet the challenge of emotional upset with nature. It may well be the most potent force you have!"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"11 - Healing Foods For The Mind And A Sharper Memory Because the body and the mind are so dependent upon food for health, it is essential to provide nourishing and natural foods. Yet the problem of nutritional deficiency is widespread, and such deficiency can lead to emotional disorders. A good rule of thumb is to reduce the intake of unnatural or refined foods such as sugar, bleached flour, cakes, pastries, candies, coffee with caffeine, cola, commercial teas, prepared, processed, frozen and dehydrated foods. Replace these with wholesome, all-natural, complete foods. The noted physician, Lester M. Morrison, M.D., in The Lew Fat Way to Health and Longer Life, has this to say: \"Health authorities, nutritional experts and practicing physicians are agreed that although Americans can afford to buy more and better food than any other people in the world, their diet is sadly deficient in certain important nutritional elements. We are a nation that is overfed but undernourished.\" Dr. Morrison then asks: \"What is wrong with our diet and our eating habits? Many things are wrong with our diet and eating habits. Nowhere in the world is food treated so badly before it is eaten as in the United States. Here it is raised by the use of artificial chemicals. In an all-out effort aimed at quantity, rather than quality, we do everything humanly possible to destroy the original character ... Moreover, by the time most of our food reaches the consumer, it is too highly processed, refined and improperly preserved. \"To add to this inadequacy, we destroy what nutrient value remains by flame, fire, by watering it down with tap water and by overloading it with salt, sugar or seasoning. Then we sit down during hurried and harried business hours and bolt it down. \"And the result? Some 60 million or more Americans, adults and children, suffer from constipation, bad teeth, skin troubles, digestive disorders, fatigue, nervousness and a multitude of other complaints. Most of them are caused directly by poor nutrition and sub-clinical vitamin deficiencies.\" Dr. Morrison has devised a \"five-step program\" that has reportedly helped improve the body-mind health of his patients. Here is his plan: (1) Daily, as a food supplement at breakfast, two to four table spoons of lecithin made from soya beans. (Available at health food stores.) (2) Each day, add to your diet, Vitamin B-complex in a goodly amount. (Author: Consult your physician on the amount.) (3) Add daily to your diet at least 150 milligrams of Vitamin C and a doctor-prescribed amount of Vitamin A. (4) Take two table spoons of soya bean oil, com oil or safflower oil (cold-pressed) daily for essential"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"fatty acids. These oils may be used in salads, taken straight, or in some kind of juice â€” as you like. (5) Include in your diet each day from two to four table spoons of whole wheat germ. This may be eaten as a cereal for breakfast with fruit or any way desired. The emphasis upon lecithin, Dr. Morrison explains, is to help ease the problem of hardening of the arteries which often impairs brain-mental function, among other problems. Dr. Roger Williams, biochemist-author of Nutrition in a Nutshell suggests a body-mind eating program including plenty of seeds and nuts, meat, poultry, fish and other freshwater and saltwater fish (avoid shellfish because of pollution problems) leafy vegetables, root and tuber vegetables, carrots, potatoes, fruits of all kinds, melons and tomatoes, yeast, dairy products and eggs. Wholesome, natural unprocessed foods. Some natural foods are specifically reported to promote a feeling of emotional well-being and to revitalize thinking and memory power: (1) Millet. A tiny grain â€” not much larger than the head of a pin â€” resembling a bean, but it is a powerhouse of vitamins, minerals, protein and lecithin. It contains all 10 of the essential amino acids. It is often 25% complete protein. It is easily digested, non-acid forming, non-mucus forming, does not ferment in the stomach. Cooked, it looks much like cream of wheat. Available whole grain and ground. About four parts water to one part millet is satisfactory. Add honey and milk to heat up before you take the millet out of the pan so it stays piping hot. Millet is available at many grocery stores as well as health stores. (2) Sunflower Seeds. Another powerhouse of vitamins and minerals, and unsaturated fatty acids. They are a special treasure of niacin and have more of this brain-food nutrient than wheat germ, soya beans or even peanut meal. In addition, sunflower seeds have 55 plus percent of high-quality brain-nourishing protein. (3) Raw Sesame Seeds. A good source of protein, unsaturated fatty acids and also calcium. Sprinkle raw sesame seeds on salads. Add them to hot millet cereal. Try cold-pressed sesame seed oil for a big boost of valuable nutrients. Munch on sesame seeds. They're chewy, delicious and healthful. TIP: Roll natural peanut butter, honey and sesame seeds into little balls for a tasty healthful confection. (4) Pumpkin Seeds. As nourishing as sunflower seeds and rich in protein, minerals and unsaturated fatty acids. These seeds are the \"germ\" of the plant and may be called \"brain food\". (5) Soya Beans."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Almost a perfect food, listing more protein than beef, more calcium than milk, more lecithin than eggs, as well as amino acids, vitamins, minerals. Lecithin, mentioned earlier, is made from soya beans. Try soya bean flour too, a potent combination of the B-complex vitamins, protein, minerals, etc. fa cook soya beans soak overnight in cold water. Then cook, bake, roast like any other bean. (6) Yogurt. Sour or clabbered milk, it has a soothing effect on the digestive tract. It facilitates metabolism, the key to good mental as well as physical health. (7) Yeast. We refer to brewer's yeast, the most potent natural source of the B-complex. Combine with desiccated liver and give yourself a powerful dose of the nutrients needed to feed a healthy body and build a healthy mind. SUGGESTION: For a good \"mind-boosting\" tonic, mix one tea-spoonful of brewer's yeast in a glass of fresh juice. Drink once or twice a day. (8) Desiccated Liver. This is the entire liver, selected from healthy cattle, dried and defatted at a temperature low enough to conserve as much of the nutritional value as possible. It is available at health stores in tablet and powder form. Desiccated liver is a liver concentrate, the final product weight about one-fourth as much as the fresh liver. It's loaded with a potent supply of the B-complex vitamins as well as valuable protein, and other vitamins and minerals. (9) Kelp. Also known as sea salt, kelp is a product of the ocean, taken from seaweed. It is a powerful source of iodine needed to stimulate the thyroid gland which influences mental health. (10) Pure Peanut Butter. A good supply of valuable protein as well as thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2) and niacin, plus calcium and phosphorus. All these are considered mind nourishers. (11) Raw Wheat Germ. This tiny germ is the life of the wheat germ, the seed inside the grain. It is the heart of the grain, rich in protein, the B-complex vitamins, unsaturated fatty acids. Use as a cereal or bake your own bread with it. (12) Fresh Raw Vegetable Juices. Also fresh raw fruit juices. These are rich in vitamins, minerals and enzymes. For emotional-health-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"building amino acids, minerals, and other nutrients, try fresh juices. These concentrated sources of Nature's goodness help promote a feeling of abundant health. In general your foods should be wholesome, as natural as possible, unadulterated by chemicals, preservatives or artificial flavouring or colouring. From A Drug Culture To A Nature Culture. Our current \"drug culture\" may have arisen from the \"life style\" of giving narcotics and chemotherapy for a wide variety of emotional illnesses ranging from the \"Nervous housewife\" to institutional confinement. Originally, chemotherapy was valuable for treating serious illnesses under a doctor's close supervision. But when prescription pills began being dispensed for just about every sort of complaint, the \"drug culture\" threatened the health of the nation. For this reason, many doctors are urging a return to a \"Nature culture\" in which all-Nature products are used to help correct the cause of the emotional upset, and thereby help ease the symptoms. Undeniably, some chemotherapy is of importance in more severe cases under hospital situations. Examples are: Schizophrenia. Characterised by general withdrawal and disintegration of personality. When it involves regression to childishness, it is called hebephrenia. Sometimes, a total physical flaccidity or stiffness occurs and this is called catatonia. In severe cases, chemotherapy is often used at the start and then a \"nature culture\" program is introduced to help nourish the organs affecting emotional health. Paranoia. Characterised by delusions and hallucinations, commonly of power or persecution. The paranoid is often violently aggressive and dangerous. In extreme cases, chemotherapy is needed to help control criminal behaviour. As with schizophrenia, many modern physician-nutritionists start by administering drugs, introduce natural methods later. Manic-Depressive. The victim of this psychosis suffers from extreme states of joy or depression. He may suffer from one or the other, or they may alternate in a recurring cycle. In many reported situations, the manic- depressive can be helped with all-natural methods from the start â€” under a doctor-prescribed program. Anxiety. The anxiety-sufferer is nervous, has vague, generalized fears; physical symptoms include heart palpitations, irregular breathing, profuse perspiration. Natural therapy is often used from the start."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Phobias. Some two dozen phobias exist. In this situation, analysis helps ease the mind and natural foods help the body promote emotional health so the entire person is being treated. Hysteria. Prolonged stress is often responsible. Paralysis and anaesthesia (loss of sensitivity to touch) are common. Again, a combination of analysis and proper nutrition is often most helpful. Neurasthenia. Emotional upsets often cause the chronic tiredness, strange pains, ringing in the ears symptomatic of neurasthenia. The need is for improvement of the neurological system through proper nutrition and analysis. The earlier treatment is begun, the better the chances for recovery. The best course is to obtain proper medical care as soon as possible. Emotional disturbance may be reflected in a wide variety of symptoms. All do not occur at the same time, or with the same intensity in the emotionally upset. Any suspicion of erratic behaviour should be reported to your doctor. The Limitations Of Drugs In Treating Emotional Upsets. As stated previously, drugs or chemotherapy may be valuable in certain extreme situations when the patient is hospitalised or violent. But pills too easily and casually dispensed can have adverse effects upon the mind-body system. The two most widely used â€” and misused â€” forms of drugs are the amphetamines, the so-called pep pills, and the barbiturates. First, we'll examine the amphetamines. A medically supervised dose of amphetamine does four things to the human body: (1) It shuts off the fatigue signals built into the physical system as a defense mechanism. (2) It cuts down the hunger signals which normally tell the brain that the body craves nourishment. (3) It stimulates the nervous system with an unnatural sense of renewed energy and euphoria (sense of well-being). (4) Because the amphetamine provides no new source of energy or food, the physical system is stimulated to tap its reserve resources. Because the amphetamines were found to be non-addictive, in a physical sense, they quickly gained the reputation of being a \"harmless, non habit-forming stimulant\". It was soon discovered, however, that they are psychological dynamite. For too many users they became a crutch for daily living. Failure to take the regular dose leaves the user terribly depressed, sleepy or listless. Result: emotional dependence upon the drug."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Self-medication with amphetamines has become widespread among truck drivers, pilots, bus drivers and trainmen â€” where the safety of many may depend upon the alertness of one or two persons. Among students, most often at exam time when amphetamines are used over several days of intensive cramming. Among sports participants. Among musicians, actors, businessmen and lawyers, and others under prolonged physical and / or mental tension. What happens with prolonged use of these drug stimulants? Users gradually find it necessary to increase the dosage to overcome the tolerance level built up by the body. There is a gradual deterioration in the individual's normal capacity for reliability and responsibility. Eventually, he is unable to compete on the same level of efficiency. There is also emotional deterioration reflected in marked irritability and temper outbursts. Personal confidence and self-respect are impaired. Sloppy, slovenly appearance often characterises the chronic amphetamine user. The penalty for dependency on these \"pep pills\" is the same as the penalty for any faulty living habits â€” emotional upset. It becomes a vicious cycle â€” a strong argument for a return to a \"Nature Culture\". Where amphetamines \"pep up\" the user, barbiturates \"calm him down\". A medically-supervised dose of the barbiturates â€” also known as sedatives â€” does the following to body and mind: (1) It mildly depresses the action of the nerves, skeletal muscles and the heart muscle. (2) It slows down the heart rate and breathing, and lowers the blood pressure. (3) It induces sleep and eases tension. (4) Speech and movements may be uncoordinated (among those who have built up a tolerance and can stay awake). Skilled tasks are performed sluggishly and without precision. Judgment and perception are impaired. Confusion, slurred speech, irritability and an unsteady gait are often noted in chronic users. An overdose may cause the person to fall into a coma. Barbiturates are physically addictive. Tolerance develops and withdrawal symptoms occur when the user stops taking the drug. Barbiturates also distort how people see things and slow down reaction time and response. They are a dangerous cause of automobile accidents, especially when taken together with alcohol. Barbiturates tend to heighten the effects of alcohol. The illicit manufacture and dispensing of barbiturates has put them in the hands of many who should not use them. But some who do have these problems: People who suffer from anxiety or insomnia and are dependent upon the drug culture for relief. Persons under excessive stress, or those who cannot tolerate ordinary emotional stress, are vulnerable to this \"easy\" way to cope with challenges and responsibilities. People who know they will have to face a certain difficult situation will use the drug to enable them to meet it."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Users may become so dependent that a heavy dose could cause a temporary toxic psychosis (mental derangement) requiring hospitalization. This is usually accompanied by auditory and visual hallucinations. Prolonged or habitual users sometimes develop suicidal tendencies and risk accidental death from barbiturate poisoning. Another vicious cycle: barbiturates, used incorrectly can cause the same emotional-nervous upsets they are meant to control. Surveys show that of all the prescriptions doctors write for mind-affecting drugs, about 1 in 4 is for a barbiturate. From Drug Culture To Nature Culture? The switch is possible because scientists have discovered that many pep pills â€” or \"barbies\" â€” work by releasing norepinephrine, a substance stored in nerve endings, and concentrating it in the higher centres of the brain. This speeds up the heart action and metabolism, the body's way of converting food into the nutrients it needs. Therefore, some doctors now suggest releasing the norepinephrine through the use of certain natural food programs and special dietary supplements. This program is working â€” and we may yet go from a drug culture to a nature culture."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"12 - Memory And It's History From the time when man first began to depend on his mind for coping with his environment, the possession of an excellent memory has been a step to positions of command and respect. Throughout human history there have been recorded remarkable â€” sometimes legendary â€” feats of memory. The Greeks It is difficult to say exactly when and where the first integrated ideas on memory arose. The first sophisticated concepts, however, can be attributed to the Greeks, some 600 years before the birth of Christ. As we look back on them now, these 'sophisticated' ideas were surprisingly naive, especially since some of the men proposing them are numbered among the greatest thinkers the world has ever known. In the sixth century BC, Parmenides thought of memory as being a mixture of light and dark or heat and cold. He believed that as long as any given mixture remained unstirred, the memory would be perfect. As soon as the mixture was altered, forgetting occurred. Diogenes of Apollonia advanced a different theory, in the fifth century BC. He suggested that memory was a process that consisted of events producing an equal distribution of air in the body. Like Parmenides, he thought that when this equilibrium was disturbed, forgetting would occur. Not surprisingly, the first person to introduce a really major idea in the field of memory was Plato, in the fourth century BC. His theory is known as the Wax Tablet Hypothesis and is still accepted by some people today, although there is growing disagreement. To Plato, the mind accepted impressions in the same way that wax becomes marked when a pointed object is applied to its surface. Plato assumed that once the impression had been made it remained until it wore away with time, leaving a smooth surface once again. This smooth surface was, of course, what Plato considered to be equivalent to complete forgetting â€” the opposite aspect of the same process. As will become clear later, many people now feel that memory and forgetting are two quite different processes. Shortly after Plato, Zeno the Stoic slightly modified Plato's ideas, suggesting that sensations actually 'wrote' impressions on the wax tablet. Like the Greeks before him, when Zeno referred to the mind and its memory, he did not place it in any particular organ or section of the body. To him as to the Greeks, 'mind' was a very unclear concept. The first man to introduce a more scientific terminology was Aristotle, in the late fourth century BC. He maintained that the language previously used was not adequate to explain the physical aspects of memory. In applying his new language Aristotle attributed to the heart most of the functions that we now attribute to the brain. Part of the heart's function, he realised, was concerned with the blood, and he felt that memory was based on the blood's movements. He thought that forgetting was the result of a gradual slowing down of these movements. Aristotle made another important contribution to the subject of memory when he introduced his laws of association of ideas. The concept of association of ideas and images is now known to be of major importance to memory."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"In the third century BC, Herophilus introduced 'vital' and 'animal' spirits to the discussion. He thought that the vital, or 'higher order', spirits produced the 'lower order' animal spirits, which included the memory, the brain and the nervous system. All of these he thought to be secondary in importance to the heart. It is interesting to note that one reason advanced by Herophilus for man's superiority over animals was the large number of creases in his brain. (These creases are now known as the convolutions of the cortex.) Herophilus, however, offered no reason for his conclusion. It was not until the nineteenth century, more than 2000 years later, that the real importance of the cortex was discovered. The Greeks, then, were the first to seek a physical as opposed to a spiritual basis for memory; they developed scientific concepts and a language structure that helped the development of these concepts; and they contributed the Wax Tablet Hypothesis, which suggested that memory and forgetting were opposite aspects of the same process. The Romans The theoretical contributions by the Romans to our knowledge of memory were surprisingly minimal. The major thinkers of their time, including Cicero in the first century BC and Quintilian in the first century AD, accepted without question the Wax Tablet Hypothesis of memory and did little further work on the subject. Their major and extremely important contributions were in the development of memory systems. They were the first to introduce the idea of a Link System and a Room System, both of which will be described in later chapters. The Influence of the Christian Church The next major contributor to memory theory was the great physician Galen in the second century AD. He located and delineated various anatomical and physiological structures and made further investigations into the function and structure of the nervous system. Like the later Greeks, he assumed that memory and mental processes were part of the lower order of animal spirits. He thought that these spirits were manufactured in the sides of the brain and that, consequently, memory was seated there. Galen thought that air was sucked into the brain and mixed with the vital spirits. This mixture produced animal spirits that were pushed down through the nervous system, enabling humans to experience sensation. Galen's ideas on memory were rapidly accepted and condoned by the church, which at this time was beginning to exert a great influence. His ideas became doctrine, and as a result little progress was made in the field for 1500 years. These intellectual strictures stifled some of the greatest minds that philosophy and science have produced. In the fourth century AD St. Augustine accepted the church's idea that memory was a function of the soul and that the soul was located in the brain. He never expanded on the anatomical aspects of these ideas."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"From the time of St. Augustine until the seventeenth century there were almost no significant developments, and even in the seventeenth century new ideas were restricted by doctrine. Even so great a thinker as Descartes accepted Galen's basic ideas, although he thought that animal spirits were sent from the pineal gland on special courses could be triggered. The more clear-cut these courses, the more readily, he thought, would they open when animal spirits travelled through them. It was in this way that he explained the improvement of memory and the development of what are known as memory traces. A memory trace is a physical change in the nervous system that was not present before learning. The trace enables us to recall. Another great philosopher, who went along with the tide, was Thomas Hobbes, who discussed and considered the idea of memory but contributed little to what had already been said. He agreed with Aristotle's ideas, rejecting nonphysical explanations of memory. He did not, however, specify the real nature of memory, nor did he make any significant attempts to locate it accurately. It is evident from the theories of the seventeenth-century intellectuals that the inhibiting influence of Galen and the church had been profound. Practically all these great thinkers accepted without question primitive ideas on memory. Transitional Period â€” the Eighteenth Century One of the first thinkers to be influenced by the Renaissance and by the ideas of Newton was David Hartley, who developed the vibratory theory of memory. Applying Newton's ideas on vibrating particles, Hartley suggested that there were memory vibrations in the brain that began before birth. New sensations modified existing vibrations in degree, kind, place and direction. After being influenced by a new sensation, vibrations quickly returned to their natural state. But if the same sensation appeared again, the vibrations took a little longer to return. This progression would finally result in the vibrations remaining in their 'new' state, and a memory trace was thus established. Other major thinkers of this period included Zanotti, who was the first to link electrical forces with brain functions, and Bonnet, who developed the ideas of Hartley in relation to the flexibility of nerve fibres. He felt that the more often nerves were used, the more easily they vibrated, and the better memory would be. The theories of these men were more sophisticated than previous ones because they had been largely influenced by developments in related scientific fields. This interaction of ideas laid the groundwork for some of the modern theories of memory. The Nineteenth Century With the development of science in Germany in the nineteenth century, some important advances"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"occurred. Many of the ideas initiated by the Greeks were overthrown, and work on memory expanded to include the biological sciences. Georg Prochaska, a Czech physiologist, finally and irrevocably rejected the age-old idea of animal spirits on the grounds that it had no scientific basis and that there was no evidence to support it. He felt that limited existing knowledge made speculation on the location of memory in the brain a waste of time. 'Spatial localisation may be possible,' he said, 'but we just do not Know enough at the moment to make it a useful idea'. It was not for some fifty years that localising the area of memory function became a useful pursuit. Another major theory presented in this century was that of Pierre Flourens, a French physiologist, who 'located' the memory in every part of the brain. He said that the brain acted as a whole and could not be considered as the interaction of elementary parts. Modern Theories Developments in memory research have been aided to an enormous degree by advances in technology and methodology. Almost without exception psychologists and other thinkers in this field agree that memory is located in the cerebrum, which is the large area of the brain covering the surface of the cortex. Even today, however, the exact localization of memory areas is proving a difficult task, as is the accurate understanding of the function of memory itself. Current thought has progressed from Hermann Ebbinghaus's work, at the turn of the century, with regard to basic learning and forgetting curves, to advanced and complex theories. Research and theory can be roughly divided into three main areas: work on establishing a biochemical basis for memory; theories suggesting that memory can no longer be considered as a single process but must be broken down into divisions; and the clinical surgeon Wilder Penfield's work on brain stimulation. Research into the biochemical basis for memory was initiated in the late 1950s. This theory suggests that RNA (ribonucleic acid), a complex molecule, serves as a chemical mediator for memory. RNA is produced by the substance DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is responsible for our genetic inheritance. For example, DNA determines eye colour. A number of experiments have been performed with RNA that lend support to the idea that RNA does indeed have a lot to do with the way in which we remember things. In one instance, when animals were given certain types of training, the RNA found in specific cells was changed. And further, if the production of RNA in an animal's body was stopped or modified, this animal was unable to learn or remember. An even more exciting experiment showed that when RNA was taken from one rat and injected into another, the second rat 'remembered' things that he had never been taught but that the first rat had. While research into this aspect of memory is progressing, other theorists are saying that we should stop emphasising 'memory' and concentrate more on the study of 'forgetting'. Their position is that we do not so much remember as gradually forget. Encompassing this idea is the duplex theory of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"remembering and forgetting, which states that there are two different kinds of information retention: long-term and short-term. For example, you have probably experienced a different 'feeling' in the way that you recall a telephone number that has just been given to you and the way that you recall your own telephone number. The short-term situation is one in which the idea is 'in' the brain but has not yet been properly coded and is therefore more readily forgotten. In the long-term situation the idea has been completely coded, filed and stored, and it will probably remain there for years, if not for life. Research into direct brain stimulation was initiated by Dr. Wilder Penfield. In more detail: when performing craniotomies (removal of a small section of the brain) in order to reduce epileptic attacks, Penfield had first to remove a portion of the skull lying over the side of the brain. Before operating, Penfield conducted a systematic electrical stimulation of the open brain, and the patient, who remained conscious, reported his experience after each stimulation. In an early case Penfield stimulated the temporal lobe of the brain, and the patient reported a re-created memory of a childhood experience. Penfield found that stimulating various areas of the cortex produces a range of responses but that only stimulation of the temporal lobes leads to reports of meaningful and integrated experiences. These experiences are often complete in that when re-created they include the colour, sound, movement and emotional content of the original experiences. Of particular interest in these studies is the fact that some of the memories stimulated electrically by Penfield had been unavailable in normal recall. In addition, the stimulated experiences seemed to be far more specific and accurate than normal conscious recall, which tends to be a generalization. It was Penfield's belief that the brain records every item to which it pays conscious attention and that this record is basically permanent, although it may be 'forgotten' in day-to-day living. More recently, theorists have returned to a position similar to that of Flourens, in which they are suggesting that every part of the brain may include all memories. This model is based on holographic photography. In simple terms, a holographic photographic plate is simply a piece of glass, which, when two laser beams are passed through it at the right angle, reproduces a ghostly, three-dimensional photograph. One of the amazing things about this photographic plate is that if you smash it into 100 pieces and take any one of those 100 pieces, you can shine the two laser beams through it and still get the same (although slightly more blurred) picture. Thus every part of the holographic photographic plate contains a mini record of the overall picture. British scientist David Bohm and others are suggesting that the brain is similar. In other words, every one of our multi-million brain cells may, in fact, act as a mini brain, recording in some fantastically complex way, as yet indiscernible to our clumsy measuring instruments, our entire experience. Fantastic as this theory may sound, it goes a long way toward explaining the perfect memories we"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"have in dreams, the surprise random recall, the memories of the perfect memorisers, the statistics from Rosensweig's experiments, the results of Penfield's experiments, the mathematical grandeur of Anokhin's results, and much of the near-death-type experiences. Even now we are still on the threshold of a wondrous new world of knowledge, similar to that of the first people who began to explore our planet immediately after having discovered that they could make boats. How Many Brains? Supplementing this modern research has been the new discovery that we have not one brain but two. Professor Roger Sperry recently received the Nobel Prize for his breakthrough work in this area. Sperry discovered that each one of us has a brain that is divided into two physiological sections, each dealing with different mental functions. Sperry has shown that, in most of us, the left side of the brain deals with the following areas: Logic Language Number Sequencing And Linearity Analysis Similarly, in most of us, the right side of the brain deals with the following mental functions: Rhythm And Music Imagination Daydreaming Colour Dimension Take In Artwork This is your super streamlined brain, depicted as if viewed with X-ray eyes from a vantage point to the left of the left shoulder. Thus, you are looking at the left hemisphere, which deals with the mental functions of logic, language, number, sequencing and linearity, and analysis. The right side of the brain, the back tip of which you can just see, deals with rhythm and music, imagination, daydreaming, colour and dimension. These two ranges of abilities combine to give you a super powered memory. No matter what you have been taught, somewhere latent within each of you lies each one of these capabilities simply waiting to be freed. Sperry and others also found that the more people use both sides of their brains together, the more the use of each side benefits the other."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"For example, it was found that the study of music helped the study of mathematics, and the study of mathematics helped the study of music; that the study of rhythm helped the study of languages and that the study of languages helped the learning of bodily rhythms; that the study of dimension helped the study of mathematics and that the study of mathematics helped the brain conceptualize dimension; and so on. It was similarly found that if a person used more of these areas, the more generally capable was his entire memory."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"13 - The Link System In this chapter you will see for yourself that your memory can improve, and that by improving it, your imaginative powers and your creativity will also be released. The Link System is the most basic of all the memory systems and will give you a foundation with which to make learning the most advanced systems extremely easy. This basic system is used for memorising short lists of items, such as shopping lists, in which each item is linked to or associated with the next.

Imagine yourself walking out of your front door perfecting the most amazing balancing trick: in your mouth is the most enormous silver-coloured serving spoon, the handle-end of which you are holding between your teeth, as you taste and feel the metal in your mouth. Carefully balanced in the ladle-end of the spoon are six exaggerated beautiful crystal glasses, through which the sunlight reflects brilliantly into your bedazzled eyes. As you look with delighted amazement at the glasses, you can also hear them delicately tinkling on the silver spoon. Going outside into the street, you step on the most gigantic yellow and brown coloured banana, which skids with a swish from under you. Being a fantastic balancer, you barely manage not to fall and confidently place your other foot groundward only to find that you have stepped on a shimmering white bar of pure soap. This being too much for even a master, you fall backward and land seat down on a mound of eggs. As you sink into them, you can hear the cracking of the shells, see the yellow of the yoke and the white of the albumen, and feel the dampness soaking into your clothes. Using your imaginative ability to exaggerate anything, you speed up time and imagine that, in a couple of seconds, you have gone back inside, undressed, washed your soiled clothes in a super biological washing powder, which allows pure, shimmering water to leave the washing machine, and then visualise yourself once again on your way out of the front door. This time, because you are slightly tired by the previous accident, you are pulling yourself along towards the shops on a gigantic rope made of millions of threads of dental floss, the rope connecting your front door to the chemist's shop. just as all this exertion begins to make you feel hungry, wafting on the warm wind comes an incredibly strong aroma of freshly baked whole-wheat bread. Imagine yourself being dragged by the nose as you salivate extraordinarily thinking of the taste of the freshly baked bread. As you enter the baker's shop, you notice to your amazement that every loaf on the baker's shelves is filled with brilliantly pulsating red tomatoes, the baker's latest idea for a new food fad. As you walk out of the baker's shop, noisily munching on your tomato and whole-wheat loaf, you see walking down the road with the most amazing rhythm the sexiest person you have ever seen (really let your imagination go on this one). Your immediate instinct is to buy the person roses, so you dive into the nearest flower shop, which sells nothing but red roses, and buy the lot, bedazzled by the greenness of the leaves, the redness of the flowers, the feel of the flowers as you carry them, the feel of the thorns, and the fragrance from the roses themselves. When you have finished reading this fantasy, close your eyes and run back through the image-story you have Just completed.

The truth is that all of us have goals of various kinds; but one goal common to all is the desire to live and to be happy. Millions of men and women waste much of their lives on small details that get them nowhere. We live fast but to what purpose, to what end? We get nowhere and we do it on the double. We are not able to simplify our lives by remembering our generic goal â€” to be happy. And you can't rush after happiness, not because happiness is elusive but because when you run after it, you are running away from it. Why? You must remember that happiness is internal. You are happiness and you can't run after it when it is already within you. You must be realistic and live creatively instead of running around a vicious cycle of nothingness. If people who run around as if they don't know what they want would stop to think a moment, they would know what they want, Then slowly, without rushing, they would work for it and live for it. Remember, live creatively instead of quickly. You don't have to take to the woods and forget it all. Take to yourself, resolve within yourself what goal you want to achieve, cut out the useless details that take you way from yourself. Then go after your goal with thought, determination, and belief, a goal within your capabilities and training. You go forward toward your goals when: 1. You reach for today's opportunities. 2. You exercise your right to succeed. 3. You use your courage to stand up under stress. 4. You jump the hurdles of doubt and indecision. 5. You are aware of your real potential. 6. You see yourself successful. 7. You seek improvement. 8. You nourish your self-image with faith and belief.

The Romans constructed such a system easily. They imagined the entrance to their house and their room and then filled the room with as many objects and items of furniture as they chose â€” each object and piece of furniture serving as a link-image onto which they attached the things they wished to remember. The Romans were particularly careful not to make a mental rubbish dump of their room; precision and order (attributes of the left side of your brain) are essential in this system. A Roman might, for example, have constructed his imaginary entrance and room with two gigantic pillars at either side of the front door, a carved lion's head as his doorknob, and an exquisite Greek statue on the immediate left as he walked in. Next to the statue might have been a flowering plant; next to the plant, a large sofa covered with the fur of one of the animals the Roman had hunted; and, in front of the sofa, a large marble table on which were placed goblets, a wine container, bowls of fruit, and so forth. Let's say that the Roman then wished to remember to buy a pair of sandals, to get his sword sharpened, to buy a new servant, to tend to his grapevine, to polish his helmet, to talk to his child, and so on. He would simply imagine the first pillar at the entrance of his imaginary room festooned with thousands of sandals, the leather polished and glistening, and the smell delighting his nostrils; he would imagine sharpening his sword on the right-hand pillar, hearing the scraping as he did so, and feeling the blade as it became sharper and sharper; his servant he would imagine riding a roaring lion, while grapes he might remember by imagining his exquisite statue totally entwined with a grapevine on which were luscious grapes that he could imagine seeing and tasting so well that he would actually salivate; his helmet he could imagine by substituting the container of his imaginary flowering plant with the helmet itself; finally, he could imagine himself on his sofa, his arm around the child to whom he wished to speak. The Roman Room System is particularly amenable to the use of the left and right brain, and to the Memory Principles, because it requires very precise structuring and ordering, as well as a lot of imagination and sensuality. The delight of this system is that the room is entirely imaginary, so you can have in it every wonderful item that you wish: things that please all your senses, items of furniture and objects of art you have always desired to possess in real life, and similarly foods and decorations that especially appeal to you. Another major advantage of using this system is that if you begin to imagine yourself in possession of certain items that exist in your imaginary room, both your memory and creative intelligence will begin to work subconsciously on ways in which you can actually acquire such objects, increasing the probability that you will eventually do so. The Roman Room System eliminates all boundaries on your imagination and allows you to remember as many items as you wish.

He announced at the beginning of the meal that he had to get something off his chest or he'd explode: his car had just been broken into, the front windscreen smashed and his briefcase stolen. He was particularly frustrated because the briefcase contained his diary and a number of other items important to him. As the pre-dinner drinks were downed, and the hors d'oeuvres completed, we began to notice that our friend was not really participating in the conversation and that he seemed to have a faraway look on his face as he very occasionally jotted notes on a scrap of paper. He eventually burst into the conversation again, announcing that he was ruining the evening for himself because he could remember only four items that had been contained in his stolen briefcase, that he knew there were many more, that he had to give a full report to the police within two hours, and that the more he tried to remember the more blocked he became. Consider what you would have recommended that he do in order to recall. Several of us at the table who were familiar with Memory Principles then took him through the following exercise: instead of continuing to allow him to concentrate on what he could not remember (what he in effect was doing was concentrating more and more on the absence of memory), we took him through what I call Reliving the Immediate Relevant Past. We asked him when he had last had his briefcase open. It turned out that it was at the office just before he left work, at which point he suddenly remembered that he had put two important magazine articles on the top of the pile in the briefcase. We then asked him when he had last had the briefcase open before leaving home for work. It turned out to have been the previous night after dinner, and he remembered having put in two more articles plus a tape recorder and a calculator, in preparation for the following morning. Finally we asked him to describe the interior design of his briefcase, and as he went through a detailed description of each compartment and section, he remembered pens, pencils, machines, letters and a number of other items that he had previously completely 'forgotten'. Within twenty minutes of what turned out to be a delightful and playful reliving of his previous twenty-four hours, in which his frown gradually turned into a broad smile and his physical poise improved, he recalled eighteen additional items to the original four he had recalled after a painful and unpleasant one hour and twenty minutes. The secret in re-remembering is to allow the full power of your memory to flow freely without 'trying' to remember any one specific thing. The secret within the secret is to 'forget about' whatever it is you are trying to remember and to surround the absence (what you have forgotten) with every possible association or connection available to you (see diagram below). Usually the best way to do this is to 'relive' all experiences that connect in any way with the item you are trying to remember. This"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"technique works immediately in practically all cases. In those rare instances where there is not an immediate recall, complete the reliving exercise in exactly the way outlined, and then give your brain the instruction to forget about it on the conscious level but work it out on an unconscious level. You will find that within a few hours or days of this 'programming' you will suddenly be taken by surprise â€” at a meeting, while driving your car, in the shower, on going to sleep or waking, in the bathroom, etc., when your memory supplies the item you have forgotten. This memory technique, like the others, improves all other aspects of your memory as well as your creativity, and in addition gives you a special boost of confidence when you realise that, no matter what you have forgotten, you have within the left and right hemispheres of your brain an unconscious Sherlock Holmes who will solve any memory mystery you choose to give him!"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"16 - Frustration How can you overcome frustration? Everyone experiences one kind of frustration or another every day. Frustration should stimulate us, help us solve a problem, not yield to it. When we are crushed under it, it becomes a chronic type of negative feeling. We become creative artists when we let our servo-mechanism create ideas and solve problems. But too many of us jam our creative mechanism with worry, anxiety, and fear, trying to force a solution with the fore-brain, the seat of our thinking but not the seat of doing. This jamming of the creative servo-mechanism doesn't serve us at all. It inhibits us from our goals, putting a roadblock of negation in front of us, creating frustration. There are five roadblocks of frustration: 1. We worry not only before making a decision but after. We carry this extra fifty pounds of worry on our minds all day. The cure? Express anxiety before we make a decision â€” not after. There are, let us say, five solutions to a problem. Anxiety is creative while we choose which road to take. Once we choose, however, we must stop worrying and call upon the confidence of past successes to guide us in the present. If we call upon the failures of the past to guide us in the present, we create immediate frustration. 2. We not only worry and fret about today, we worry about yesterday and tomorrow. This sets up a pattern of instant frustration because we call upon past failures and future apprehensions to guide us in the present. We can't think positively with negative feelings. The cure? Think only of today. Every day is a complete lifetime. Forget yesterday; lose it in the vacuum of time. Tomorrow doesn't exist; when it comes it is another day. Let your servo-mechanism do what it can do well: respond to the present. Try, try, try â€” now, now, now!!! 3. We try to do too many things at one time. This creates tension instead of tone, spasm instead of comfort. When we try to do too many things at one time, we try to do the impossible. The cure? Don't fight relaxation. Join it. Learn to do one thing at a time. This brings relaxation. This frees you from the burden of hurry and failure. 4.

Notably, salt has been known to \"whip up\" the blood pressure and cause emotional palpitations that create erratic behaviour symptoms. A common emotional disorder, insomnia, is often traced to a high salt intake. Michael M. Miller, M.D., reported to the American Psychiatric Association that he had obtained relief for 11 out of 12 patients from insomnia and nervous tension by cutting down the amount of salt in their diets. Six patients who had been morphine addicts also showed a marked degree of insomnia and tension. By cutting down on their salt intake, Dr. Miller was able to ease their emotional disorders so they could be helped. In an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association 1945, Dr. Miller tells about treating 20 nervous patients suffering from chronic insomnia. He prepared a wholesome food program and limited them to two grams of sodium chloride (salt) per day. Results? Seventeen of the patients reported their symptoms had disappeared. When 13 of these were again given a generous salt intake, they suffered emotional disorder and nervous relapse. Why is a low-salt program so soothing? Dr. Miller gives this answer. \"Excess salt increases the irritability of sensitive nerve tissues and brings on tensions and sleeplessness. On a salt-restricted diet, this irritability decreases because as salt is cut down, calcium is built up in the tissue in sufficient quantity to alkalize the body fluids and quiet the nerves.\" We already know that calcium is a valuable nerve-soothing mineral. Salt appears to interfere with calcium absorption somehow. This mineral imbalance might well cause tension and emotional unrest. Minerals especially are desperately needed by the tense organism for healthful relaxation. Salt appears to upset this balance in the case of potassium too. Salt drives it out of the body, changing the delicate acid-alkaline balance of the tissue cells, leading to a tense and constricted neurological system. Wholesome, natural foods have their own built-in flavours. But if you want something more tangy, then try using herbs instead of salt. Dill, oregano, chopped chives, basil, all-spice, caraway, curry, ginger, lemon or lime juice, saffron, tarragon, sweet paprika, rosemary, sesame or poppy seeds. There are limitless herbs and endless combinations you can use to make your own taste discoveries. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, M.D., in Mind and Body: Psychosomatic Medicine, Pinpoints salt as inducing tension headaches. He writes: \"Migraine is only one type of headache, although a common one. It and others are attributed to ... pressure inside the cranium caused by an increased flow of water to the tiny blood vessels of this area because of an abnormal retention of salt in the tissues\"."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Dr. Dunbar describes successful treatment of nervous patients by removing \"the excess salt and decreasing the irritability of the walls of the blood vessels and by recommending a salt-free diet\". Common salt, used in excess, may so disturb the balance of mineral ingredients in the blood, it will replace worn-out cell tissues instead of potassium. The cells cry out in nervous tension, in response to this local irritation. Distress signals may include headaches, hypertension, nervous disorders and a jerky, spasmodic attitude and uncontrollable physical reactions. According to Postgraduate Medicine, in a study involving some 1,346 people at Brookhaven National Laboratory, there is a direct correlation between salt intake and hypertension. Increased salt intake appears to whip up the metabolism and the functions of the circulatory system to induce a state of chronic tension. In such situations, a gradual reduction of salt until it is entirely eliminated would be most relaxing. At least one man believes salt may lead to snoring. Writing in Prevention Magazine, about his experience on a low-salt program, he said: \"The more salt (or sodium) a person eats, the more fluid a person retains and more swelling of tissues of the nasal passages as well as other parts of the body. About all heavy salt eaters I have known seem to have been snorers. \"My wife occasionally makes large kettles of soup which require salt for best flavour. But when she does, I notice a big increase of snoring in the family.\" A clue to the power of salt in inducing emotional disorders may be in its ability to drive out calcium, the mineral so needed for emotional health. Egon V. Ullmann, M.D., in Diet in Sinus Infections and Colds, tells of being able to relax his nervous patients by eliminating salt and sugar. He traces many allergies and sinus-cold problems to emotional upsets. Dr. Ullmann explains how an excessive intake of salt can drive out the tranquillizing calcium from the system. This leads to impaired metabolic function and a reaction on the nervous system. A simple program would be to eliminate salt and thereby help promote a healthy buildup of needed calcium to soothe the nervous system. Many high salt-consumers are also heavy smokers, and the use of salt and tobacco have been seen as contributory factors in some cases of nervous breakdown. Salt narrows down the arteries and reduces an adequate flow of blood to the brain, preventing its full oxygenation. Smoking also constricts blood flow. Therefore, the moment a smoker begins to suffer prolonged tensions, emotional upsets, nervous misbehaviour, he might be wise to reject salt and tobacco. Here is an interesting fact: the width of the blood vessels varies widely in different individuals. If a person has wide blood vessels to begin with and fat gets on the walls, there is still plenty of room for the blood to circulate. This suggests a reason why some persons can violate all health rules and yet are emotionally stable. But, suppose the person has very narrow blood vessels to begin with and uses much salt and smokes heavily? He may run the risk of receding emotional-physical health and a possible breakdown."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Eliminating salt, whether in the cook pot, or the salt shaker, may help improve your basic emotional health.

In prolonged situations, there may even be symptoms resembling that of a nervous breakdown. A key to the \"mystery\" of the influence of nutrition on emotional health may be in the body-balance of calcium and phosphorus levels. Nature has decreed that there must be a healthful balance of these two substances or else the parasympathetic nervous system will react with somewhat temperamental outbursts. How Natural Foods May Heal Nervous Disorders. Dr. Melvin E. Page, author of Degeneration-Regeneration, tells of helping many patients by eliminating excess carbohydrates from their diets, eliminating white flour products and cutting down on the sugar intake. In this way, Dr. Page was able to stabilise the delicate calcium-phosphorus level and help relax and heal nervous disorders. He presents the case of Mrs. B., a 33-year-old woman who had a diet rich in sugar, but low in minerals and the Vitamin B-complex group. She had high blood pressure, was nervous and sensitive to cold, had cold hands and feet, slept a great deal because of extreme tiredness and had back pains. Her nervous disorder was so severe that she was constantly losing her temper. Dr. Page treated her by eliminating sugar and white flour from the diet. He then prescribed supplements of minerals, Vitamin B-complex and halibut liver oil capsules to stabilise Mrs. B.'s calcium-phosphorus levels. Within a year, on this easy-to-follow prescribed food program, Mrs. B. was able to enjoy a happy and healthier life. A nervous and temperamental road contractor, Mr. C., age 55, treated by Dr. Page, had a high calcium level and extreme nervous disorders. While Mr. C. ate no sugar, he did admit to eating pie, canned fruit and lots of white bread products. Dr. Page took him off sugar and all foods containing sugar and also took him off the bleached white bread products. Gradually, his calcium-phosphorus levels were stabilised â€” and so was his disposition. How Calcium Nourishes The Nervous System. As has already been pointed out, calcium is essential to the nervous system. Ninety-nine percent of all calcium in the body is found in the bones and teeth. The remainder of a scant 1 percent circulates in the soft body tissues and the fluids. Calcium is vital for nerve nourishment, for normal bone and tooth development, for blood clotting, for enzymatic action and the regulation of fluid passage through walls of tissues and cells. It is needed for the alternate contraction and relaxation of the heart muscles. Calcium is stored inside the ends of bones in long, needle like crystals called trabeculae. When you are in a stress situation, your body draws calcium from these bones, if you do not have enough in your"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"daily diet. Your body draws first usually from the spine and pelvic areas. This causes a weakness that may lead to a vertebrae fracture. An early symptom is osteoporosis or brittle bones. Another calcium deficiency illness is osteomalacia, deformed bones, such as in rickets. How Phosphorus Soothes A Temperamental Disposition. Calcium is closely related to phosphorus. Each body cell contains phosphorus, and about 66 percent of this mineral is found in skeletal system in the form of calcium phosphate. The balance appears in soft tissues as organic and inorganic phosphate. Organic phosphate compounds aid in converting oxidative energy to cellular work, during emotionally tense situations, the nervous cells and tissues call for \"food\" in the form of phosphorus. It may well be considered Nature's own tranquilliser. High energy phosphates play a soothing role in the synthesis of protein, carbohydrate and fat, and also help to maintain emotional tranquility. In particular, phosphorus works to provide nervous energy benefits, soothe the action of muscular contraction, participate in gland secretions, function of the kidneys. Phosphorus is needed as a generator of nerve impulses. A deficiency or imbalance of this mineral means a \"weak generator\" and an uncontrollable nervous system that may erupt in violent bursts of temper. Phosphorus also seems to help in the formation of lecithin (a nerve-feeding nutrient), and also in the metabolisation of fats and starches. Phosphorus Sources: Most of the foods containing calcium are also good suppliers of phosphorus. The problem is that bleached white flour and white sugar deplete these supplies. A suggestion made by many doctors is to keep these non-foods to a minimum or eliminate them entirely. Basic food sources of phosphorus include all dairy products, natural cheeses, poultry, fish, peas, whole-grain cereals, beans and nuts. A tablespoon of brewer's yeast mixed in eight ounces of soya milk, whole milk, buttermilk and skim milk is reported to make a good calcium-phosphorus nerve tonic. Frequent Small Meals Help Strengthen Emotional Health. One researcher advises strengthening the nervous system by eating small meals. She suggests: \"A good breakfast (not coffee and a sweet roll), a mid-morning snack (not a soft drink or cookies), preferably protein like raw nuts, sunflower seeds (high in protein), cheese, boiled egg, etc. Eat a good lunch with plenty of protein. An afternoon snack very much like the mid-morning one, then a good evening meal with more protein. This eating often of protein keeps the blood sugar from falling too low too rapidly, and at the same time, builds up the health of the glands ... A snack at bedtime is a must... In the middle of the night, when the blood sugar has fallen, is when so many... crazy symptoms occur.\""},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"This woman was subject to temperamental derangement and emotional disorders but was reportedly able to correct her condition with evenly-spaced smaller meals, high-protein, low-sugar, low-starch and moderate fat. When she says that a \"snack at bedtime is a must\", she refers to a high-protein snack such as sunflower seeds, sliced egg, or nuts. Other Nutritional Suggestions. The need for Vitamin B-complex to feed a healthful nervous system has already been discussed in some detail. But to amplify further, symptoms such as neuritis, exhaustion, digestive disorders, deranged blood pressure, pounding nervous headaches may occur as a result of a prolonged deficiency of Vitamin C, or folic acid and biotin of the B-complex. These are found in raw wheat germ and rice polish. Franklin Bicknell, M.D., in The Vitamins in Medicine, emphasises the need for such nutrients, as well as for wholesome, natural foods. Dr. Bicknell, and other researchers, suggests a complete balance of vitamins and minerals to help nourish the entire system. Your doctor can prescribe the specific formula to meet your needs. Dr. Bicknell tells of treating patients with severe mental problems and disorders with prescribed amounts of natural Vitamin B-complex, together with healthful foods such as freshly cooked meat, liver, eggs, raw vegetables and yeast. In cases of more severe mental derangement, yeast and liver concentrates were given, along with special supplements of vitamins A, D and C, and iron. Disturbed, often violent, patients were able to respond and eventually live without emotional symptoms. In these disturbed cases, there was also an emphasis on calcium-phosphorus foods. A temper outburst drains the calcium supply. Metabolic studies show that such emotional explosions exert an adverse effect upon the retention of both nitrogen (needed by calcium) and calcium itself. A prescribed calcium-phosphorus program aims at providing emotional defenses to nourish temperamental outbursts and ease erratic symptoms. Suggestions: It's possible to consume much calcium but lose it with faulty combinations. For instance, the dark outer leaves of salad greens are rich in calcium. But if you eat bleached bread and sugary foods with your calcium foods, you provide phytic acid which interferes with calcium absorption. Presumably this is due to the precipitation of insoluble calcium phytate in the gastrointestinal tract. The wisest course, nutritionists believe, is to eliminate artificial bleached foods to enable the gastrointestinal tract to absorb and assimilate calcium without interference. Good Calcium-Phosphorus Sources. Soy beans are an excellent source of these valuable minerals. Use as a vegetable; soy flour is good for baking; use soy flour as a thickener instead of white flour. Try soy milk as a beverage."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Sesame Seed: This is a romantic, yet healthful source of minerals that help soothe the system. Sesame seeds are available at most health food stores. Use them to coat hamburgers, liver, fish. Other Sources: Molasses, almonds, figs and beans are reportedly good sources of nerve-emotion- building calcium and phosphorus. Control Tempers With The \"Mind Food\" Vitamin. A late discovery in the Vitamin B-complex family of temper-taming vitamins is pantothenic acid. Doctors have found that supplements of this nutrient, or an increase in the foods containing it, can help persons who are cranky, always on the go, or a \"bundle of nerves\". Pantothenic acid is part of the complex molecule of coenzyme A. This substance acetylcholine, a chemical transmitter at the autonomic nerve endings controlling motor and secretory intestinal activity. This complex is also involved with the metabolism of protein, fats, and carbohydrates; in the synthesis of sterols and steroid hormones, and porphyrin which forms the basis of the respiratory pigments of hemoglobin. The British Medical Journal (1963) alerted the public to the temper-taming qualities of pantothenic acid. Research doctors said that \"after a period of stress, the acetylcholine reservoir in the body is diminished, but ... if pantothenic acid is given, the acetylcholine level may be increased for as much as 50%\". This helps feed the entire nervous system and thereby promote a feeling of emotional fortitude. E.P. Ralli, M.D., writing in Endocrinology suggests that pantothenic acid can help build up resistance to stress and help nourish the glandular-hormonal system involved in tension. It could be the difference between maintaining a cool even disposition and exploding in unreasonable anger. Food Sources Of The \"Temper-Taming\" Vitamin. Good sources are brewer's yeast, liver, kidney, heart, salmon and eggs. Other sources are mushrooms, broccoli, beef tongue, peanuts and soybean flour. The Agriculture Handbook tells us that the muscles of young, rapidly growing animals are highest in pantothenic acid supply. Beef and veal liver are believed to be the most potent sources. (Just two ounces of beef liver will offer 5,324 milligrams of pantothenic acid.) The dark meat of turkey has about twice as much pantothenic acid as the white meat. Organ meats are better sources than muscle meats. Balanced Diet Is Needed For Nerve Health. We repeat: a healthful and balanced diet is essential to promote a tranquil attitude and strengthen the nervous system. Nervous cramps in the hands and feet can be soothed by calcium. Magnesium, found"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"in fresh leafy green vegetables, can ease the grating effect on the nerves that often leads to an emotional outburst. Protein is helpful to maintain the glandular hormonal rhythm, and, of course, the B-complex vitamins are precious sources of nerve nourishment. Bleached white flour and white sugar products devitalise and deplete the Vitamin B-complex stores, lb help boost emotional health capacities, resist temper outbursts, nutritionists advise eliminating these non-foods."}]
