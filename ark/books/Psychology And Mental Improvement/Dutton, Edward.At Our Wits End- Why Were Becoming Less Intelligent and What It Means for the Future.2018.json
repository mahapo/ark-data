These days, it takes longer than that to flyfrom London to Athens.With the advent of Concorde in 1969, we had dealt with an extremely difficultproblem—how to get from A to B much faster. We had been trying to solve thisproblem since 1954. That was when Arnold Hall, director of the Royal AircraftEstablishment, set up a committee to look into supersonic flight. The USA was animportant country. Western Europe was almost as vital. There were crucialbusiness connections between the two regions. These were massively complicatedby the 8 hours it took to fly between America and Western Europe. It wastedtime. It wasted money. How could we solve this problem?The solution was Concorde. Concorde wasn’t a minor update to existing technologywhich made things slightly easier, like the introduction of activepower-steering in BMW cars in 2003. This was a major breakthrough, comparable tothe invention of aeroplanes themselves (‘How can we fly?’) or the Spinning Jenny(‘How can we massively speed up production?’). In the 1950s, some of the world’smost intelligent and creative people were put to work to find a solution to thisenormous problem and, on 2nd March 1969, Concorde was in the sky.It fell from the sky on 25th July 2000. Air France flight 4590 took off fromParis’s Charles de Gaulle Airport and promptly smashed into a hotel, killing all100 passengers and 9 crew, as well as 4 people on the ground. The crash wasessentially due to incompetence. A titanium ‘wear strip’ had been attached tothe back of the thrust reverser of a Continental Airlines DC 10 Airliner as partof an operation to repair it. Not only was the wear strip badly produced, but ithad not been made by the Airliner’s original equipment manufacturer.Accordingly, when the plane took off—just minutes before Concorde did on thesame runway—the wear strip fell off. As Concorde accelerated over this sharp bitof metal at high speed, it punctured Concorde’s tyre, causing rubber to spin offthe wheel and break open the fuel tank. This led to a fuel leak, which in turnled to a fire, resulting in one of Concorde’s engines being shut down. At thespeed it was going, it was committed to take off, but Concorde couldn’t gainenough velocity or altitude to remain in the air. So Concorde crashed; allbecause an earlier aeroplane hadn’t been maintained properly. There had beenproblems with Concorde before—such as part of the rudder breaking off on a 1989flight—but never a crash. The system had always worked. The pilots, in the heatof the moment, had always realised how to save the plane; the ground crew nevermade any major mistakes. Public confidence was shaken and, by 2003, Concorde waspermanently grounded.[1] [part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-1] We were backto how it used to be. Flights between the UK and the USA were once againinterminable.1969 was also the year that we put a man on the Moon. In many ways, this may bethe greatest achievement in the history of humanity to date. This was notsomething that developed organically and unplanned. Things naturally develop inthis way if people of reasonable intelligence and conscientiousness work on themfor long enough. Science fiction writers had long dreamed of going to theMoon.[2] [part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-2] The American governmentdecided they wanted a manned flight to the Moon in around 1958, as they competedwith the Soviets to win the Space Race. The Soviets had already beaten them ingetting a satellite into space and would soon beat the USA in landing machineryon the Moon and getting a man into space. Thousands of America’s best minds wereput to work to achieve this quite fantastic goal. It was accomplished on 20thJuly 1969, with every step in the voyage having to be ‘checked’ by eight NASAexperts. With each new twist, they had to think on their feet, calculate all thepossible risk scenarios, and reach the correct decision to avoid a tragedy.There were 5 further manned flights to the Moon until December 1972.[3][part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-3] But we carried on dreaming ofexploring the stars until the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster in 1986. Theshuttle exploded just after launch because one of the rocket’s o-rings hadmalfunctioned due to recent cold weather. A potential problem with o-rings hadbeen identified in 1971 but had never been addressed and it was only the severecold combined with this failure that led to the crash. Caution would havedictated abandoning the launch due to the freezing conditions; financialconsiderations dictated otherwise. Confidence in manned space travel had beendamaged. The space programme—in terms of serious leaps, like getting people toMars—began to stagnate.[4] [part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-4]Why? Why is it that we used to be able to fly from the USA to London in lessthan 4 hours but now we can’t? Why is it that we used to be able to put peopleon the Moon but now, it seems, we can’t? The answer is surprisingly simple. Weare no longer intelligent enough to be able to do these things. We have becometoo stupid to keep Concorde in flight; let alone go back to the Moon."},{"pageContent":"Don’t be Stupid!‘Don’t be stupid!’ you might be thinking. ‘There are so many complex reasons whywe haven’t been back to the Moon! The economic collapse in the 1970s, the end ofthe Cold War meaning there was no longer as strong an incentive to compete withthe former Soviet Union, and attention turning to making life fairer for peopleon Earth. It’s the same with Concorde. There’s been another economic collapsesince then. We just haven’t got round to doing these things, but we could..!’Science looks for the theory that explains the most with the fewest assumptions.Named Occam’s Razor, after the English friar William of Occam (c.1287–1347), theaxiom that the simplest theory is the best is accepted by all scientists. If wecan plausibly explain two separate events with one theory, then that is superiorto having a different theory for each event. We will show in this book that thesimplest explanation, with the fewest assumptions, for our failure to get backto the Moon or to get Concorde back in the sky is that we are becoming lessintelligent. Other explanations might account for one of the two events, oraspects of these, but they will not explain everything without leaving questionsunanswered or assumptions hanging in the air. Our explanation does not sufferfrom these problems."},{"pageContent":"The Decline of IntelligenceOur argument is based on a number of foundations, each of which are‘controversial’—at least among those who are sure they know best—but each ofwhich we will demonstrate in the course of this book.To understand what’s going on, we have to understand what ‘intelligence’ is andwhy it’s so important. ‘Intelligence’ is, basically, the ability to solvecomplex problems and do so quickly. The quicker you can solve a problem, thecleverer you are. The cleverer you are, the more complicated the problem has tobe before you’re stumped. On adult samples intelligence is 0.8 heritable meaningthat 80% of the variation among individuals is due to genetic factors (aheritability of one would indicate that 100% of the variation was genetic).[5][part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-5] Socioeconomic status is stronglyconnected with intelligence. It ‘correlates’ strongly with it. A correlation isa measure of the degree to which the change in one variable predicts the change,either positively or negatively, in a second variable. The key measure capturedby correlations is the percentage of variance which is simply the value of thecorrelation squared. Correlations are scaled from –1 to 1—these being perfectcorrelations (i.e. where 100% of the change in the second variable is predictedby the first). A correlation of 0 indicates no association between thevariables. So, 0.7 is a very strong positive correlation indicating that thevariables share almost 50% of the variance in common. Salary correlates withintelligence at 0.3, while intelligence correlates with education level at 0.5.And intelligence correlates with how well you do at school at 0.7.[6][part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-6] We all know of people who aren’t thatbright but work very hard and get top marks in their school leaving exams, butthey are the minority. It’s intelligence that really counts.We will see in this book that the process of Darwinian selection acting onintelligence did not end on the African Savannah 100,000 years ago. Rather,Darwinian selection, and social selection in particular—where Darwinian fitnessstems from cooperation among or competition against other members ofsociety—continues into the present day, with more general evolution among humansstill on-going. This process led to what the British economist Gregory Clark,who we will meet later, has termed ‘The Survival of the Richest’.Between the 1400s and the mid-19th century, in every generation, the richer 50%of the population had more surviving children than the poorer 50%.[7][part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-7] As economic status and intelligenceare positively correlated this led to us becoming more and more intelligentevery generation. This carried on until the most intelligent people—the outlier,super-clever geniuses—were so numerous and so capable that their innovationsactually allowed us to take control of our environment to an unprecedentedextent. Here we had the Industrial Revolution. This led to more and moreinventions, such that our standard of living—our ability to feed thepopulation—outpaced population growth, meaning that our living standards now arehigher than those of medieval kings.However, this process led to a reversal of selection for intelligence. With hugeleaps in medical technology, we went from around a third of children failing toreach adulthood to almost none failing to do so. In pre-Modern times, thechildren who died young were disproportionately the children of those with lowersocial status, and therefore by proxy, lower intelligence and, as we’ve seen,intelligence is strongly heritable. The main reason for this was that the lessintelligent were poorer, lived in worse conditions, and had worse nutrition.This pattern of selection favouring higher intelligence ceased with theIndustrial Revolution’s innovations in medicine and hygiene, such as widespreaduse of inoculations against formerly killer childhood diseases such as measles,in addition to social initiatives aimed at alleviating the effects of poverty.In fact, it didn’t just cease. It went into reverse.The resultant low death rate of children also meant that people no longer had tohave large numbers of kids in order to guarantee that some survived.Accordingly, they could have smaller families and use the left over money tofund an even higher standard of living. By the late 19th century, this meantthat having a large family tended to be an accident. It would happen becausepeople were less able to think of the future here in the now, meaning they wouldimpulsively have sex and not worry about the consequences. As we will see, suchimpulsive behaviour is a function of low intelligence,[8][part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-8] as is the inability to successfullyuse contraception. This meant that the less intelligent soon started having morechildren than the more intelligent.With the rise of women in the workplace, we will show that the most intelligentwomen dedicate themselves to their careers in their twenties and even the firsthalf of their thirties. If they have children at all (they often don’t want toor find they’ve left it too late) they will only have a small number of them. Bycontrast, less intelligent women, less career-focused and more impulsive, willhave larger numbers of children, starting as teenagers and sometimes becominggrandparents by the time their more intelligent contemporaries begin thinkingabout motherhood. For these reasons, we will show that it has long beenpredicted that we would have become less intelligent.However, in this book we will go further. We will prove that although we arebecoming better at certain very narrow abilities, due to improvements in theenvironment we have managed to create for ourselves, we are, in fact becomingless intelligent with respect to the core cognitive ability—generalintelligence.[9] [part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-9] We are becoming lessintelligent at a quite staggering rate as well. In the last one hundred years,we may have lost as many as 10 IQ points: the difference between the averagepoliceman and the average school-teacher today.[10][part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-10] This research is cutting edge; manyscientists consider it ‘controversial’ even. But, as we will see, the fact thatwe are getting less intelligent cannot be ignored any longer. Only if weunderstand what is happening to us can we act in such a way so as to minimisethe problems that this is generating and perhaps even overcome some of them."},{"pageContent":"The Grand PlanWe know what we’re up against. If we were trying to persuade people of somethingthat they wanted to hear or something that sounded nice, we’d have no problems.A book which suggested that everything was a matter of environment and if wejust did the right things we could create a utopia would be much more crowdpleasing. But it would also be nonsense. We are interested in what’s reallyhappening and in persuading the intelligent reader that it really is happening.As such, we will assume no detailed knowledge of science or statistics. We willsimply assume an open and inquiring mind.We will begin, in Chapter Two, by looking at the concept of intelligence. Wewill show that it is a scientifically valid concept, as are the IQ tests thatare used to measure it. We will respond to many criticisms of the concept anddemonstrate that it can be robustly defended against them. Proxies forintelligence—other measures that correlate with it; are partial measures ofit—will also be examined.In Chapter Three, we will discuss the history of Darwinian selection forintelligence, from the world of dogs and chimpanzees up until pre-industrialEngland. We will then see, in Chapter Four, that average intelligence wasincreasing in Europe up until the dawn of the Industrial Revolution becausewealth—and thus by proxy intelligence—strongly predicted how many survivingchildren you had.In Chapter Five, we will explore the concept of personality, as it is so vitallyrelevant to understanding genius, which will be explored in Chapter Six. InChapter Six, we will show that between 1450 and 1850 there was a rise in percapita levels of genius; in super-intelligent people with a very specific kindof personality who innovated hugely important ideas.We will see in Chapter Seven that a number of 19th- and early 20th-centuryscientists were convinced that the cleverest people had the fewest children bythat time. We will show that they were correct and, in modern Western countries,the cleverer you are the fewer children, on average, you have. We will look atthe reasons for this ranging from contraception to career women.In Chapter Eight, we will explain how something called the Flynn Effect hasmasked the intelligence decline on IQ tests in the 20th century, as the scoreshave increased year on year. However, we will see that the Flynn Effect doesn’tactually reflect a rise in ‘core’ or ‘general’ intelligence—just the imperfectnature of the IQ test for measuring intelligence changes over time. And we willshow that, anyway, now even the Flynn Effect has gone into reverse in someplaces. In Chapter Nine, we will present evidence that on measures of generalintelligence that more reliably measure this, over time, than the IQ test,intelligence has indeed been declining.In Chapter Ten, we will demonstrate how our findings fit with the idea thatcivilisations don’t last forever. They rise and fall and we will see thatchanges in average intelligence are the simplest explanation for this process.In Chapter Eleven, we will show that Rome—like us—likely reached a peak ofintelligence due to selection, then fertility became negatively associated withintelligence, causing Rome to subsequently decline and collapse. The same thinghappened to civilisations in the Middle East and China.In Chapter Twelve, we will see how Western civilisation has followed thedifferent stages which all civilisations do and we will see that we are now inthe winter of civilisation. Finally, in Chapter Thirteen, we will look—inpractical terms—at what we can do about this. Can we break out of the winter ofcivilisation before there is further collapse?"},{"pageContent":"Back to the Concorde and the MoonSo, why can we not re-launch Concorde—or make a superior version? We have ahypothesis, for which we will present more evidence as the book progresses.We should conceive of a pyramid of technology, an idea presented by the Britishpsychiatrist Bruce Charlton.[11] [part0004_split_004.html#footnote-48952-11] Atthe top are the inventors —the geniuses. Beneath these are those who develop andrefine the invention. Below them, are those who can fix the invention. Thenthere are those who can operate it and finally those who cannot even use it, butmight be employed to maintain it. When Concorde was launched, every level ofthis pyramid was slightly more intelligent than it is now. Between 1969 and theyear 2000, those at the very top of the intelligence pyramid simply didn’tproduce many descendants, while those at the very bottom in 1969 were asignificantly larger percentage by the year 2000. This meant that in the year2000, by the standards of 1969, everybody in the aviation industry was slightlyupwardly socially mobile relative to their level of intelligence. A better termfor this might be ‘over-promoted’. The average pilot was less intelligent—and soless able to solve a sudden, difficult problem—and, more importantly, so was theaverage engineer on the ground and the average worker in an aircraft hangar.This decline in IQ meant that more and more people were making more and moreshort-term, bad decisions. And this culminated in the piece of defective, sharp,poorly-made metal strip falling off the DC 10 and being left on the runway,causing Concorde to crash.But what is this thing intelligence? We all know people who are convinced thatintelligence is really meaningless and it’s hard work and social skills thatcount. Is intelligence really so important?1 [part0004_split_000.html#footnote-48952-1-backlink] For a detailed history ofConcorde, see: Orlebar, C.

But the problem with this idea is that some people are muchbetter at some tasks than others. If your computer breaks down you might askLee, who knows a lot about computers and designs computer games for a living, tohelp you out. Lee is clearly not equal—in terms of that ability—to Mike, who isa doctor but knows nothing about computers. You’d be better off going to Mike ifyou found a lump on your neck. He would be better than Lee and of more value toyou in those circumstances.Intelligence—like computer-mending ability or diagnostic skill—is something thatsome people have more of than others. Intelligence, as we have alreadydiscussed, is the ability to solve complex problems and to solve them quickly.Some people are clearly better able to solve complex problems and solve themmore quickly than others and those people are more intelligent than those whoare slower or who simply have to give up because the problem is beyond them. Wemight compare intelligence to how a computer works.[2][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-2] Intelligence is like the processingspeed of a computer and how much complexity it can deal with before it simplyfreezes and shuts down.So, intelligence can be seen as the ability to think abstractly and to learnquickly—this leads to the ability to solve problems quickly, especially if theyare similar to problems that have previously been experienced. Intelligence ismeasured by IQ tests. Some people argue that IQ tests don’t really measureintelligence and are essentially only a measure of how well people do on IQtests. This is simply wrong. Child and adulthood IQ correlate at between 0.7 and0.85.[3] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-3] IQ test scores in childhoodwill predict many important things in adulthood—higher intelligence predictshigher education level, higher socio-economic status, higher salary, betterhealth, greater civic participation,[4][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-4] lower impulsivity, and longerlifespan.[5] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-5] Lower intelligencepredicts higher criminality, and shorter-term future-orientation.[6][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-6] In other words, people who are moreintelligent tend to live for the future whereas people who are less intelligenttend to live for the now. A test of future-orientation might involve placing achocolate bar in front of a young child and telling him or her that he or shecan have that chocolate bar now or two chocolate bars in an hour’s time if thechild doesn’t take the chocolate bar now. The more intelligent the child is, themore likely s/he is to wait an hour. Higher IQ people are also more trusting.The relationship between intelligence and trust may result from the way in whichless intelligent people will be less able to discern whether someone istrustworthy, meaning it would make more sense for them to trust nobody.[7][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-7] In general, therefore, highintelligence—as measured by IQ tests—predicts socially desirable outcomes. Afull list of the qualities that are associated with intelligence based on IQtests—specifically ‘general intelligence’, which we will define below—can beseen in Table 1.Table 1.

This ability is sometimes described as being distinct fromintelligence as measured by IQ tests. There is no question that what gets called‘emotional intelligence’ is important and people who are high in it will havemore friends than those who are socially awkward and who constantly offendpeople. However, the ability to solve social problems has been shown to beweakly predicted by intelligence and all cognitive aptitudes inter-correlate inrigorous studies.[10] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-10] It may becomforting to believe, if you’re not that smart, that reality is like the USsitcom The Big Bang Theory. Penny is not as bright as her scientist friends butshe has much greater ‘emotional intelligence’ and you’re like her. But thereality is that, on average, somebody like Leonard would not only be moreintelligent than Penny but more socially skilled than her as well. This wouldnot necessarily be true of Sheldon, but we will look at outliers like him inChapter Six."},{"pageContent":"Different Kinds of IntelligenceAnd this leads us onto the real ‘different kinds of intelligence’. In general,we can understand that some people are more intelligent than others. Aftertalking to somebody, and often after talking to them for not very long, we getan intuitive sense of how ‘bright’ or ‘smart’ they are. But this can bedeceptive in a minority of cases.For example, somebody might be very verbally skilled and use lots of bigwords—meaning they will superficially appear to be highly intelligent—while,overall, this is not the case. You certainly wouldn’t want them trying to fixyour computer or diagnosing some potential illness. This is seemingly true ofmany people who study humanities subjects at university. In general, the studentreading a subject like cultural anthropology will have high verbal intelligence,but they will be much less intelligent, overall, than the stereotypicaltongue-tied, shy physics student.[11][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-11] That is not to say that there arenot highly intelligent and inquisitive students who study cultural anthropology,but it is simply a fact that their average IQ is lower than that of those whostudy physics.11 IQ tests typically measure three main forms of intelligence:verbal, numerical (mathematical), and spatial (geometric). On the WAIS IV test,a typical test of verbal comprehension (known as ‘similarities’), for example,might be: ‘What is the connection between an apple and an orange?’ The correctanswer is that they are both kinds of fruit. This would receive 2 points whereasthe less nuanced ‘They’re both food’ would receive 1 point.[12][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-12] Some people are higher in onemanifestation of intelligence than another, and, rarely, they may have aboveaverage scores in one measure of intelligence and below average in another.Einstein, for example, had such fantastic mathematical skills that he worked outan original proof of Pythagoras’s theorem at the age of 12. However, hislinguistic skills were so poor that he failed the entrance examination for theFederal Institute of Technology in Zurich.[13][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-13] But, Einstein is an extreme case; anoutlier. Overall, in group studies, the many different measures of cognitiveability always positively correlate with one another. It is consistently foundthat, within-groups, high ability in one task goes with high ability in othertasks.This is why the computer comparison works so well. A faster processing computerwill be better at pretty much any task you set it. It will always run moreefficiently and will be able to easily cope with tasks which would overwhelmslower computers, causing them to simply crash. The positive correlations thatexist between many different cognitive ability measures mean that we can talkabout a ‘general factor’ that underpins performance in all of them. This wasfirst described statistically by Charles Spearman (1863–1945). Spearman was apioneering English psychologist and a very unusual man. He joined the army,became an officer, and then suddenly left, in 1897, intent on pursuing anacademic career. While studying for his degree at University College London, hepublished a seminal paper, in 1904, in which he showed that the ability ofschool children in tests on different subjects inter-correlated.[14][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-14] This can be seen in Table 2.[15][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-15]Table 2. Spearman’s (1904) matrix of correlations showing that all of thescholastic aptitudes correlate positively with one another—so high-levelperformance in maths goes hand-in-hand with high-level performance in classics,French, English, etc.ClassicsFrenchEnglishMathsPitchMusicClassics1French0.831English0.780.671Maths0.70.670.641Pitch0.660.650.540.451Music0.630.570.510.510.41With this, Spearman argued that there was a g-factor—a general factor —whichunderpinned the relationship between how well people did in all these diversesubjects. But let’s pause to examine Spearman’s ‘correlation matrix’ in moredetail. It can be seen that ability in French —remember this is with a Britishsample—very strongly correlates with ability in classics, which is no surprisebecause they both involve the learning of foreign languages, and French, Latinand, to a lesser extent, Ancient Greek are closely related. The correlationbetween classics and English is a bit weaker but even with maths therelationship is strong, at 0.7. We can see that the ability to learn a foreignlanguage is more strongly related to maths than it is to English. And pitchdiscrimination also correlates with these academic subjects. This is consistentwith an idea first postulated by Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911)[16][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-16]—who we will also meet later. Galtonproposed that intelligence is driven in part by the ability to notice subtledifferences among sensory inputs (pitch, colour, etc.)—so intelligent brainshave more ‘bandwidth’ as they can take in more information, which can in turn beused for solving problems more effectively. For example, if the problem wasbuilding a waterproof roof, an intelligent individual might notice that aparticular material behaved very slightly differently from another and so choosethe superior material. This ability to deal with subtlety would mean that theyhad solved the problem better.IQ is a statistical construct which measures Spearman’s g factor. So, the IQtest is measuring g. However, the IQ test is not a perfect measurer of g, justas many a school maths test will also, to some extent, measure vocabularyability along with mathematical ability, meaning it is not a perfect measurer ofmathematical ability. The IQ test —in testing, let’s say, the ability to placean animal in the correct category—is measuring g, because g predicts the abilityto do this. But there are other mental abilities that also predict the abilityto do this. So, the test also tests these measures, measures which influenceperformance in very specific cognitive domains. Spearman termed these s forspecialised abilities—there being many different s’s that are unique and thatonly influence maths ability or language-learning ability and so forth. So, theIQ test measures a series of cognitive abilities. These abilities are predictedby g but also by specialised abilities which are independent of g.Things have moved on from Spearman’s somewhat crude two-factor or g and s modelof intelligence. Today, researchers typically conceive of intelligence as apyramid. At the pinnacle is Spearman’s g factor. Beneath this are what arecalled group factors or sometimes primary mental abilities. These would includedeterminants of performance that may be shared among groupings of cognitiveabilities, but which are nonetheless independent of the g factor. Examples ofthese ‘mini-g’s’ would include the Verbal, Perceptual, and Rotational primaryability groupings.[17] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-17] These abilitygroupings strongly correlate with each other, but performance in these domainsis also in part a reflection of other things; specific narrow abilities. Beneaththese are even more specific narrow skills—i.e. s’s that predict performancewithin the sub-domains of the primary ability clusters. These, likewise,correlate with g but are also substantially measuring other highly specialisedcognitive processes. This is why somebody might not have a particularly highscore in any of three main ability clusters but, nevertheless, be brilliant atdarts or realistic drawing. They have a very specific cognitive skill. Finally,at the bottom of the pyramid are the numerous test-specificities —extremelynarrow skills that influence performance on specific ability tests, but do nothelp in others—being really proficient at pattern recognition may help on teststhat rely on this for problem solving, but won’t help much on tests that don’t(like a vocabulary test).It is important to note that not all indicators of intelligence are equallyg-loaded—that is, the degree to which they measure the g factor varies.[18][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-18] To give an example, how well you doat school in English or in maths are both strongly predicted by how intelligentyou are because they both measure the g factor. However, maths is more closelyrelated to g than English. It is a better proxy for g. English, in turn, islikely to be a better proxy for general intelligence than art. But if you were auniversity lecturer faced with a huge pile of university applications and youwanted the most intelligent students you could save a lot of time by simplyturning to how well the applicant scored in GCSE maths,[19][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-19] even if they were applying to readmodern history. This would, of course, be extreme and simplistic. But it seemsfairly likely that most admissions tutors will take GCSE maths into account evenif their subject is modern history, as the essence of it is the ability to thinklogically."},{"pageContent":"Intelligence and IQ TestsIQ compares your intelligence with those of your own age. Intelligence increasesthroughout childhood. Problems which an average adult could solve would bebeyond even the brightest three-year-old. But we would not say that thethree-year-old who was already beginning to learn to read was not veryintelligent. In comparison to adults, all three-year-olds are not especiallyintelligent. But their IQ is a different matter. Intelligence increases up tomiddle age and then decreases from middle age onwards.[20][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-20] As such, IQ is a comparativemeasure—comparing the individual with a group sample of the same age.The IQ number is a way of expressing the individual’s position in a rankordering of IQ test scores for their age group; hence the term ‘intelligencequotient’ (IQ). The average IQ is set at 100. Larger numbers represent aboveaverage IQ and lower numbers represent below average. IQ is ‘normallydistributed’ in a so-called bell curve and, in that respect, it is rather likeheight. IQ distribution, on the bell curve, is conventionally divided into‘standard deviations’ of 15 IQ points. Most people have an IQ of somewherearound the average of 100, just as most people’s height is clustered around theaverage with smaller and smaller percentages of people being either very shortor very tall. Indeed, 68% of the population have an IQ that is between 85 and115. Only 14% of the population have an IQ that is either between 115 and 130 orbetween 70 and 85. And—you can see where we’re going with this!—as a consequence95% of the population have an IQ that is between 70 and 130. This can beconsidered the ‘normal’ IQ range because those who are below 70 would beclassified as having learning difficulties and those above 130 would beexceptionally bright. So, 2% of the population have an IQ either between 55 and70 or between 130 and 145. These are the people of either very low or very highintelligence respectively. Just 0.1% of the population, at either end of thebell curve, are higher or lower still. This can be seen in Figure 1.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\iq graph.png [../images/00001.jpeg]Figure 1. The IQ bell curve.[21] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-21]We measure weight with a weighing-scale and height with a tape measure. The IQtest is simply the instrument through which we measure IQ. No instrument isperfect. Some weighing-scales will give a much more accurate and subtle readingthan others and it’s the same with IQ tests.[22][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-22] The test of the accuracy of aninstrument is if its results strongly correlate with other instruments that aremeasuring the same thing or measuring something very similar. So, one measure ofweight might involve getting people to physically lift different people andestimate which was the heaviest. If this correlated with what the weighing-scaleindicated, we could have faith in the scales. The results of IQ tests stronglycorrelate with intuitive measures of thinking ability (such as school exams) andthey are not merely culturally influenced. We know that IQ testing is valid androbust, because culture-fair IQ tests have similar predictive power acrosscultures.[23] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-23] This is exactly theopposite of what we would predict if the tests were poor-quality instrumentsthat were highly subject to cultural bias.Also, IQ test results correlate positively with something objective—that is,with differences in reaction times.[24][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-24] It is widely accepted among leadingpsychometricians such as Arthur Jensen,[25][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-25] Hans Eysenck,[26][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-26] and Ian Deary[27][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-27] that IQ tests correlate with thisobjective neurological measure. There are many different tests of reactiontimes. An American psychologist called Arthur Jensen (1923–2012) developed oneof the most commonly used. Jensen, who was Professor of Psychology at theUniversity of California at Berkeley, spent his entire academic career studyingintelligence, though he was a social worker before that. Jensen pioneered the‘odd man out test’, in which people were seated in front of a bank of lights.They observed which light went on, lifted their finger from a ‘home’ button andpressed the button closest to the illuminated light. Studies have foundcorrelations of between 0.3 and 0.4 between IQ and how quickly they did this. Onaverage, the quicker your reaction times are, the cleverer you are. In otherwords, IQ is, in part, a measure of processing speed—once again, the computeranalogy shows its relevance. This correlation with reaction times means that asignificant part of being intelligent is simply having a high functioningnervous system. So, there is every reason to be confident in the validity of IQtests.A number of other criticisms have been levelled against the objectivity of IQtests. The most fashionable is so-called ‘stereotype threat’. This is the ideathat certain groups are stereotyped to do badly on IQ tests. As such, when theytake the test they become worried about doing badly and therefore they dobadly—thus conforming to the stereotype, presumably because they’re stressed.However, studies using large samples have shown no evidence for this effectwhatsoever. In some cases, the opposite effect has been observed—those who aretold they will do badly in something become more motivated to do well and sothey do better than they otherwise would. In addition, there is clear evidenceof publication bias around stereotype threat. When a study proves it, then it’spublished. If it disproves it, it gathers dust as an unpublished dissertation orsitting in some academic’s file drawer.[28][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-28]Another criticism of IQ tests is that motivation plays a part in test scores.This is obviously true. If we give you some complex sum and tell you to solveit, most of you aren’t going to bother unless we can persuade you that doing sois vitally important to understanding the rest of the book (don’t worry—we’renot that cruel!). Motivation plays a role in IQ tests and so do a host of otherthings, like suffering from flu on the day of the test. But if nobody gets aprize for doing well in the test then people will only be equally unmotivated totry their hardest. The solution to ensuring that these factors don’t skew theresults is drawing upon lots of samples and drawing upon large samples and wehave these. For example, the US National Longitudinal Study of Youth is a sampleof over 12,000 individuals—a sample that is in fact fairly representative of thepopulation of the USA. A ‘longitudinal’ study involves repeated observations ofthe same set of individuals over time. So, the lives of the participants aretracked over time to see how they unfold.As already noted, intelligence is a vital predictor of life outcomes,correlating with school results at 0.7, university performance at 0.5, andpostgraduate performance at 0.4. It correlates with salary at 0.3 and is animportant predictor of occupational status.[29][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-29] It has been found that those inless-selective professions, such as nurses, have an IQ of about 110, while theaverage is 120 for doctors and lawyers, and higher still for those who rise tothe top of these kinds of profession.[30][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-30] The average PhD student in aneducation department has an IQ of around 117, while the average PhD student in aphysics department has an IQ of 130.[31][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-31] The more intelligent are more likelyto engage in civic activities such as voting, and are less likely to endorseextreme political parties or opinions. They are, presumably, less extremebecause they are better able to foresee the negative consequences of extremeaction and are better at perceiving nuance. They are more likely to engage incivic activity because they are more cooperative and trusting. They can alsobetter understand the positive outcomes of doing so, such as living in a niceenvironment or being politically free.[32][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-32]"},{"pageContent":"The Causes of Intelligence DifferencesWhy are there differences in intelligence? We know from studies of identicaltwins—who share roughly 100% of their genes in common—that intelligence isstrongly heritable. Heritability is in essence a measure of how closely parentsresemble their children in a group study. The number refers to how closely theparents’ IQ predicts the child’s. A heritability of 1 would mean that children’sIQs were wholly a product of their parents’ IQs; zero would mean the statisticalrelationship between parent and offspring’s IQ was random. In these twinstudies, researchers test identical twins, meaning that the only variablecausing them to diverge is the environment. Intelligence is seemingly 80%heritable—meaning that 80% of the variation among individuals is due to geneticfactors and overwhelmingly, therefore, people resemble their parents in terms ofintelligence.[33] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-33]Environmental factors that are relevant include access to good nutrition and asufficiently cognitively stimulating environment during childhood. But anintellectually stimulating childhood is not enough. Your adult environment alsoimpacts your intelligence. Those with higher intelligence will tend to create amore intellectually stimulating environment for themselves when they grow up,surrounding themselves with other highly intelligent people, for example. Forthis reason, among others, the heritability of IQ during childhood is not veryhigh, as the child’s environment will be a reflection of factors that are beyondits control. Only as the child becomes an adult will its environment start toreflect its own intelligence. This ultimately leads to a heritability of about80%.[34] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-34] Think of thesuper-intelligent character Matilda in Roald Dahl’s children’s book of the samename. Her parents have no interest in intellectual matters and there are hardlyany books in their house. This kind of environment will reduce Matilda’s IQbecause it reflects her parents’ intelligence rather than hers. As she moves inwith Miss Honey, and eventually becomes independent of her, she will start tocreate an environment which reflects her own innate intelligence. This will leadto a substantial increase in her knowledge (but not necessarily her abstractreasoning ability), which will be reflected in an increase in her measuredIQ.[35] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-35]1. AdditivityThe bulk of the heritability of intelligence is due to the action of what isknown as additivity. Genes with additive effects typically have individuallyvery small effects on the phenotype; on how the gene is expressed in aparticular environment. Thus complex traits like intelligence are massivelypolygenic, meaning that there are thousands of genes (maybe as many as 10,000)with small additive effects co-contributing to the trait.[36][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-36] In other words, intelligence isprimarily a product of lots of different genes, each with a tiny effect, ratherlike a society where the actions of each individual member all contribute, onlyslightly, to the overall character of the society. Additivity is the reason whyoffspring are typically intermediary of their parents for traits like IQ. YourIQ is generally the average of that of your parents—whose genes have ‘blendedtogether’ to make you.People furthermore tend to be sexually attracted to those who are moderatelygenetically similar to themselves.[37][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-37] This is known as ‘assortitivemating’. Couples are typically more genetically similar than two random membersof the same population, and especially on more heritable physical measures, suchas wrist circumference. This mating for genetic similarity enhances the degreeto which offspring resemble their parents, as the parents are more similar toone another, hence they will more strongly resemble their offspring. Peopleengage in the practice of assortitive mating because it is a way of indirectlypassing on more of their genes. If they mate with somebody too geneticallyclose, then they risk genetic defects due to the children inheriting two copiesof a harmful gene (inbreeding depression). If they mate with someone toodistant, then they will be passing on fewer of their genes than they could. Alsomore distantly related genes could combine in ways that may be harmful to theoffspring (outbreeding depression). According to research from Iceland, the‘sweet spot’ in terms of fertility, or producing the highest numbers ofchildren, is your third cousin![38] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-38]It would follow that this would extend to non-relatives who share the samepercentage of genes with you as do third cousins, just by genetic chance. Wewill discuss other ways of indirectly passing on your genes in Chapter Six.2. DominanceAs many traits are predominantly influenced by the action of genes with additiveeffects, children are fairly similar to their parents, both mentally andphysically. But there are exceptions to this. Traits like eye colour are notcaused by many genes with small effects, but rather by small numbers of geneswith big effects (this is termed dominance). Hence, offspring will resemble oneor the other parent in terms of eye colour, based on which parent istransmitting the dominant eye colour gene. So, with dominance traits a smallnumber of genes have a big effect.3. EpistasisThe third form of genetic action is ‘epistasis’. Interactions can occur betweengenes with both additive and dominant effects, whereby the effect of one genewill only be triggered if the other is also present. This process is calledepistasis. It’s as if the genes in this case were like Jack Sprat and his wife.Alone, they don’t do anything, but when they’re both present they interact witheach other and ‘lick the platter clean’. The contribution made to intelligenceby genes with dominant effects and interactions is smaller than the contributionmade by pure additivity.[39] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-39]However, because dominant and epistatic effects nonetheless play a role,children can occasionally be significantly different from their parents andtheir siblings.4. Genetic Action and EpistasisThe same thing can happen with intelligence more broadly. Two average peoplemight have a highly intelligent child due to a rare combination of genesinteracting with one another. In this case the IQ of that child might be heldback by the environment that their (far less intelligent) parents had createdfor them. It would start to rise when they reached early adulthood, moved awayfrom the parental influence, and began to create an environment reflecting theirown genetic IQ.Rare gene interactions and single genes with big effects may play a role in thegenetics of genius—which may account for why geniuses seem to ‘pop up’ out ofnowhere.[40] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-40] This also seems to bethe case for certain forms of giftedness, such as in mathematics, where insteadof the offspring simply having the average of the parents’ mathematical ability,the ability seems to concentrate in one child, and is not shared by the otheroffspring—suggesting the action of rare genes with dominant effects which arenot inherited equally.[41] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-41] Einstein,for example, was clearly super-intelligent, however his father, an engineer, waspresumably bright but nowhere near Einstein’s level.And, of course, the opposite can happen. Two highly intelligent parents mayproduce a rather average child—genes with big effects do not ‘breed true’,meaning that the gene may go to one but not all offspring (as in the case of eyecolour and mathematical giftedness). Rare IQ-boosting gene interactions presenton one of the parents are, furthermore, likely to be broken up in the offspring,which will reduce their IQ substantially relative to the high-IQ parent. Theintellectually stimulating environment which the high-IQ parent (or parents)creates for the child may artificially boost the child’s IQ while it is still achild. But as it leaves the influence of the parental environment, it will startto create an environment for itself based on its own genetic intelligence and soits IQ will begin to fall. It needs to be repeated, however, that most of thegenetic variance in IQ is additive in nature. Unusual cases aside, such asgenius (which are nonetheless important as we will see in Chapter Six), ingeneral, the majority of people resemble their parents in terms of ability, withthe action of additive or nearly-additive genes being responsible for up to 80%of the variation in IQ among adults."},{"pageContent":"‘But What Do You Mean By Intelligence?’Earlier, we met the ‘right-thinking’ people or, as they are commonly known, the‘politically correct’. So far, we have responded to their more logicalcriticisms, because we have shown that intelligence can be measured by IQ tests,it predicts real-world outcomes (such as educational attainment and jobperformance), the tests are broadly culturally fair, they correlate with othermeasures of cognitive ability, and they correlate with objective biologicalmeasures that relate to the efficiency of the central nervous system, such asreaction times. In addition, the idea of ‘different kinds of intelligence’ ispointless because these ‘kinds of intelligence’—emotional, musical, and soon—are correlated through the g factor. Intelligence predicts things which areimportant across cultures, and intelligence is relevant to all cultures. It isnegatively associated with criminality, for example, and, surely, no culturewould want people to actively break its rules.As such, we are left—or the detractors are left—with the more emotionally-basedcriticisms. The first is to say something like, ‘But what do you mean byintelligence?’ You then insist that it’s difficult to define. Where do you drawthe border between ‘highly intelligent’ and ‘very intelligent’? Where do youdraw the border between ‘intelligent’ and ‘stupid’? The response is quitesimple. You could level this criticism against any category and so insist itshouldn’t be used. But we can’t live like this. Reality is a mass of informationand we make sense of it by breaking it up into manageable chunks. We call these‘categories’. The test of a useful category is that it allows successfulpredictions to be made and, therefore, allows us to better negotiate theobstacles in our lives and survive. If we cannot use categories, we cannotdistinguish between ‘dangerous’ and ‘safe’ and, therefore, we will get killed.If somebody genuinely thinks that we shouldn’t use categories, they should in noway be frightened of hurling themselves from a tall building because it would bea sign of a lack of intellectual depth to distinguish between ‘short’ and‘tall’. We must, of course, define our terms but this must be balanced withpracticality or we’ll never get anywhere. If we say, ‘Lee is more intelligentthan Mike’, it’s obvious what we mean. See how many people would waste timeasking what we mean by ‘intelligent’ if we were on a crashing Boeing 747 withtwo dead pilots and we needed to work out who would be best able to figure outhow to take control of the plane."},{"pageContent":"‘Intelligence Means Different Things in Different Cultures’No, it doesn’t. The capacity to reason abstractly—to solve complex and novelsocial and environmental problems—is universal across cultures. For example, asin Western cultures, intelligence—albeit intuitively assessed—predicts successin attaining social status and leadership in tribal societies.[42][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-42] Furthermore, intelligence is valuedto a high degree as a trait in prospective partners across manycultures—indicating that intelligence is considered desirable acrosscultures.[43] [part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-43] This is consistentwith the concept of ‘intelligence’ as we have defined it. If the detractors aredefining it differently then we’re simply not talking about the same thing."},{"pageContent":"‘We Don’t Know the Genes Behind Intelligence, so We’re Just Speculating’There are many things that we know exist, but we don’t fully understand theirarchitecture. We could talk about measles before we understood its architecture.‘Measles’ used to be defined in terms of what it meant to us. It was a series ofsymptoms that seemed to happen to children. Likewise, we can define intelligenceas summarising its manifestations without fully understanding the geneticsbehind it. If we cannot do this, then it can be countered that, as science byits nature is always progressing, we do not fully understand anything and,therefore, we cannot discuss anything at all.At any rate, this objection holds considerably less water now that advances ingenomics have in fact substantially increased our understanding of the geneticsof intelligence, with recent studies having even managed to track down a numberof specific alleles (these are simply alternate forms of the same gene) whichpredict individual differences in intelligence.[44][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-44] We have now reached the point wherewe can actually predict (albeit with low accuracy) a person’s intelligence basedon their genome alone."},{"pageContent":"‘There Are Different Kinds of Intelligence’As discussed, the most well-known example of an ‘alternate’ intelligence is‘emotional intelligence’. The idea that there are multiple ways in whichindividuals can be intelligent is emotionally reassuring to some, because‘intelligence’ is a highly socially valued quality and it means that everybodycan be ‘intelligent’ in some way. But the emotional reasoning behind the desirefor multiple intelligences is akin to the precocious child who sees his littleplayground gang arguing over who should be ‘leader’ and chips in, ‘Why can’t weall be leaders?’ ‘If everybody’s somebody then no-one’s anybody.’[45][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-45] If everyone’s ‘intelligent’ thenit’s akin to everyone being ‘tall’—the concept simply becomes meaningless. Andmore importantly, as we have already discussed, these different kinds of‘intelligence’ actually positively correlate with general intelligence. Theexceptions, like ‘bodily kinaesthetic intelligence’ (essentially a measure ofmulti-limb coordination), are examples of low-level psychomotor skills and notintelligence defined in terms of the capacity to solve abstract problems."},{"pageContent":"‘Intelligence is a Very Western Concept’That doesn’t mean it’s not relevant to understanding what’s happening elsewhere.We only really developed the modern definition of ‘intelligence’ around 1912,but that doesn’t mean it’s not relevant to understanding people who lived beforethen. This would be like saying that relativistic and Newtonian physics areirrelevant to understanding cosmological events that happened in deep time,before the discovery of these physical laws. The anthropological concept of theshaman—the priest-figure and healer in certain tribes—is from Siberia,[46][part0005_split_009.html#footnote-63673-46] but that doesn’t mean the conceptcan’t be applied in other cultures. Ultimately, all words come from a culture.Should we not be able to talk about the French in any language other thanFrench? As was mentioned previously, intelligence is also highly relevant innon-Western cultures because it will predict everything from law-abidingness andcooperativeness to being able to make better arrows and shelters, and to manageothers via leadership."},{"pageContent":"‘Intelligence and Ranking People by Their IQ Makes Me Feel MorallyUncomfortable. It’s Very Dangerous’This is a fallacy—an illogical argument—known as ‘appeal to morality’. Scienceis amoral. The possible fact that using IQ tests, and measuring intelligence,may have negative consequences—let alone that it makes some people feel bad—iscompletely irrelevant to whether ‘intelligence’ is a meaningful concept andwhether IQ tests fairly measure it. If scientific data indicate that humans haveevolved from a common ancestor with chimpanzees, and you believe this knowledgeis ‘dangerous’ or ‘uncomfortable’, this has no bearing at all on whether it’strue. Anyway, the argument can also be easily turned on its head. If we don’tknow how intelligent people are then we will appoint them to professions atrandom. Accordingly, people who are intellectually incapable of—let’ssay—designing aeroplanes, will be put to work doing so. And the aeroplanes willcrash and people will be killed. We feel rather uncomfortable about that andwould suggest it is rather dangerous.So, we can conclude that intelligence is extremely important. People who aremore intelligent can do more complex things and can do them more quickly.Different measures of intelligence correlate with one another—giving rise to a‘core’ intellectual ability, or g factor, which is what actually predicts thedegree to which people solve problems more efficiently. It furthermore predictsall kinds of important life outcomes, from education level to long-term health,and it can be accurately and fairly measured by IQ tests. But now, armed with asound understanding of the concept of ‘intelligence’, let us turn to how humanintelligence has evolved.1 [part0005_split_000.html#footnote-63673-1-backlink] For a detailed discussionof political correctness, see: Ellis, F.

Where does intelligence comefrom? In order to understand this we have to understand the general principlesof Darwinian selection as set out by Charles Darwin.There are two processes by which a population of animals are kept healthy, andadapted to their environment. Those that have genetic traits, which help them tosurvive in the face of particular environmental challenges, or are simplyhealthier, will live longer and have more children. This will happen everygeneration and it is known as natural selection. As part of this, those who havegenetic disorders, or poor immunity, will be—along with their genes—constantlyeliminated from the population. This is because they won’t survive childhoodand, if they do, they won’t have many children or indeed any at all.Furthermore, there is a tendency for mothers to refuse to feed, and even tosimply kill, obviously unhealthy offspring; the so-called runts of the litter.In this way, it is ensured that only the ‘fittest’—i.e. those with the greatestpotential for reproduction—survive, because resources are not given to thosewith little chance of survival.Fitness is reflected in the degree to which an organism is healthy and adaptedto the environment. Genes are copied during the process of procreation, butthese will sometimes be copied incorrectly and you end up with a mutant gene. Ifthis mutant gene confers some benefit—such as greater strength (where this isneeded) or a better immune system—it will spread throughout the population. But,in general, animals are relatively ‘fine-tuned’ with respect to the survivalrequirements imposed upon them by their environment, so a mutant gene will moreoften than not be bad. The organism will work less well. So, the healthyorganism has a low percentage of mutant genes: a low ‘mutational load’."},{"pageContent":"Sexual SelectionThere are a number of forms of selection. Darwin’s first book, On the Origin ofSpecies, in 1858, popularised the idea of evolution and gave us the concept of‘natural selection’. His second book, in 1871, was entitled, The Descent of Manand Selection in Relation to Sex. This gave us the equally important concept of‘sexual selection’.In most animal species, males will compete—fight—to mate with as many females aspossible. In winning these fights, they establish who among them is strongest,healthiest, and who likely has very few mutant genes. Females will prefer themales who are successful in these fights because they will provide them withhealthier offspring who are more likely to survive. The population will remainhealthy and strong, because those who lack these qualities will be unsuccessfulin their attempts to persuade females to mate with them. The females willactively fight off any attempt by an unhealthy male to breed with them. In muchthe same way, the human female will fight off attempts by unattractive (inwhatever sense) males to breed with her. And, when they do so anyway, she hasbeen raped—this being considered an appalling violation in most humansocieties.[1] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-1]Darwin himself observed that, ‘It is certain that among all animals there is astruggle between the males for possession of the female.’[2][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-2] Throughout animal species, malescompete for territory or, in the case of more social animals, the group competesfor territory but each male competes for status within the male hierarchy of thegroup. Only those who are successful in gaining territory, where there is alimited amount of territory, or status within the hierarchy will be attractiveto the females. In addition, the females will be specifically attracted to thequalities which lead to the males obtaining status. These will be markers ofphysical strength—in a society where status in obtained by fighting—and goodgenetic health. Males can showcase these qualities through fighting in front ofthe females but also by strutting; by advertising their genetic quality. Thisissue has long fascinated evolutionary psychologists (psychologists who attemptto explain the evolution of widespread, and thus likely evolved, psychologicaltraits).[3] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-3]A good example of males showcasing attractive physical qualities—examined by theAmerican evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller —is the peacock’s tail. Thismay have some use in terms of natural selection, in that the peacock can makehimself look frightening to predators by displaying a particularly large tailwith eye-shapes on it. However, it is also a ‘fitness indicator’. A peacock withpoor genetic fitness—and thus a high number of mutant genes—would have to investproportionately more of its resources into simply staying alive than a peacockwith fewer mutant genes, because the body and mind of the mutant peacock wouldfunction less efficiently. As such, it would not be able to grow or maintain asimpressive a tail. The tail of a less fit peacock would be smaller, less bright,less ornate, and less symmetrical. This is because we are evolved to besymmetrical; so symmetry is correlated with a lack of mutant genes (whichinterfere with the normal course of development) and it shows that the organismis fit enough to have acquired a healthy (symmetrical) phenotype in the face ofdisease or food shortage. With these considerations in mind, the tail would tellthe peahen a great deal about the fitness of the peacock and we would expect thepeahen to (1) select for peacocks that had such an ornament and (2) select forpeacocks with the biggest and brightest tails.[4][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-4] A peacock’s tail is also a ‘costlysignal’ of the peacock’s fitness. It is a way of saying, ‘My genes are of suchgood quality that I have resources left over to grow this fantastic tail anddeal with the potential problems that it may cause, such as weighing me downwhile I am trying to escape from a predator!’"},{"pageContent":"Social SelectionAnother type of Darwinian selection that was clearly described (but not named)by Darwin in his 1871 book is social selection. This type of selection occurswhen individuals enter into social alliances, compete for social resources,compete for status, and go to war.[5] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-5]It involves competing against other members of your own, or another, society.Most obviously, if people who are able to become richer than other people are,therefore, more likely to end up with more surviving children, then this is amatter of social selection.The ways in which social selection can impact human populations are many—humansbeing an intensely social species. Traits like altruism and virtue were likelyto have been very strongly shaped by social selection—the ways in which yourfellow man acts on your behalf are going to have a big effect on your chances ofleaving descendants, especially when such actions entail the sharing of scarceresources, protection from violence, or the formation of cooperative alliances.It is important to keep in mind that natural, social, and sexual selection arenot mutually exclusive to one another—in fact they are always related to oneanother via a sequalae—or causal chain. For example, let’s imagine that apopulation of social organisms is all of a sudden afflicted with a new disease.This source of natural selection will immediately kill all those who lack anykind of intrinsic resistance to it. However, because the population is highlysocial, individuals who are more altruistically inclined may aid those who areill, putting themselves at risk in the process. The aid may increase theproportion of surviving organisms and hence social selection will work toincrease the fitness of the recipients of the aid. The altruists are alsoproducing costly social signals of their altruism (by allocating effort to thesick and putting themselves at risk in the process), which increases their oddsof being sexually selected for on the basis that the altruistic traits areproxies for having good quality genes conferring a strong immune system.Therefore natural selection entails social selection, which in turn entailssexual selection. The disease weeds out those with weak immune systems, creatingopportunities for the less vulnerable to benefit from the protective actions ofthe altruists, who in turn reap an extra fitness boost on the basis of havinghad the opportunity to display their fitness to prospective mates."},{"pageContent":"Group Selection‘Group selection’ is an important manifestation of social selection. People wholay down their lives for their group are operating a ‘group selection’ strategy.By ‘group selection’ we mean selection for groups composed of individuals withcertain traits. These are called ‘trait-groups’. There will be inter-groupdifferences in the group averages of these traits, leading to some groups beingmore successful at passing on their genes than others. Unlike the classicalgroup selection model, trait groups are comprised of variable numbers ofindividuals and their compositions can change over time. The fitness of thegroup can increase or decrease based on the change of its composition. This isbecause the composition of the group alters the relative strength of individualversus group selection, because an increase in individuals with certain traitsmay reduce or increase the group’s average level of, for example, altruism.Broadly, this is part of multi-level selection. This refers to the way in whichselection can occur at many levels such as the individual, the kinship group,the ethnic group, and the species.[6] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-6]They are making sure that their group survives and in doing so, as we will seelater, they are indirectly passing on their genes. In much the same way, peoplewho come up with a brilliant invention which allows their group to prosper andexpand are following, whether consciously or not, a group selection strategy:they are aiding the survival of their group. Group selection happens when twogroups come into conflict and must compete for scarce resources. Certainqualities, such as the desire to engage in self-sacrifice for the group,superior organisation, or abilities that lead to the production of betterweapons, will allow one group to triumph over the other. There is evidence, aswe will see later, that people differentially select in favour of their kin.Group selection extends this to the ethnic group, which is generally an extendedkinship group.[7] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-7]"},{"pageContent":"Selection for Intelligence in AnimalsWith these principles in mind, we can also understand how a certain optimumlevel of intelligence will be selected for among different species. There willbe differences in general intelligence within the species and the lessintelligent are likely to be weeded out in cases where there are clear benefitsto being able to tackle and solve complex problems. This is not justspeculation. We know there are individual differences in general intelligencewithin particular animal species and sub-species. This has been demonstrated inmice, racoons, pigeons, ravens, and chimpanzees and most recently it has beencomprehensively demonstrated in the breed of dog known as border collies.[8][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-8]British psychologist Rosalind Arden, of King’s College London’s Institute forPsychiatry, and her team procured 68 border collies in Wales aged between 1 and12 years. This is a relatively large number for animal studies of this kind.Testing them in a purpose-built barn, each of the border collies was given aseries of problems to solve, all of which were rewarded with a food treat. Onetest measured spatial intelligence (the dogs had to get a treat from behind ascreen), a second measured behavioural inference (going to a beaker pointed toby a human), and the third measured quantity discrimination (how often the dogwould go to the larger of two piles of food). Arden’s team found a clearg-factor among dogs. In general, those dogs which performed one of the tasksmore quickly or accurately also did so in the other two tasks. This has clearimplications for border collies because the more intelligent ones are kept assheep dogs while the less intelligent ones end up being pets. But this clearlyshows that there are real intelligence differences between individual animals ofthe same breed. This would have obvious effects in terms of survival in the wildbecause the more intelligent dogs would be more likely to survive and accrueterritory. Related to this is research which has re-examined a study of generalintelligence among 99 chimpanzees. The team found that the tasks administered tothe chimpanzees which were the best measures of g among chimpanzees—that is,those which were more g-loaded—were also more heritable, based on estimatesderived from the same chimpanzees.[9] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-9]So, there is not only variability in non-human general intelligence, but it ispartly heritable, meaning it can be selected for.Based on these studies, it is quite reasonable to argue that in everygeneration, the animals that are extremely impulsive or generally have very lowintelligence are much more likely to take silly risks and get themselves killed,meaning that they don’t pass on their genes. Intelligence will also becomeimportant in terms of moving up the status hierarchy, although intelligence willbe more important the more developed the animal is. In a troupe of chimpanzees,typically numbering 20 to 50, there will emerge a dominant male who will stay inplace until he is successfully defeated by a middle ranking male. The successful‘Young Turk’ must carefully judge when it is optimum to present his challenge tothe alpha male. If he makes it when he is too young, or hasn’t developed enoughsupport among subordinate males, then he may be killed or seriously injured inthe resulting fight. If he leaves it too late, he may be too physically weak dueto age and will also lose the fight. To strike at precisely the right timerequires forethought, impulse control, and social skill—such that alliances withother chimps can be developed—and the careful calculation of possibleconsequences.[10] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-10] These are allsigns of intelligence and so we would expect a certain level of averageintelligence to be maintained among chimpanzees, with the less intelligentalmost always failing to breed, or failing to breed to any significant extent.The alpha male will be the most attractive to females and will fight subordinatemales who attempt to have sex with the females, though some will still manage todo so behind his back or may even be permitted to do so to maintain an alliance.Of course, this doesn’t mean that we would expect chimpanzees to eventuallybecome as clever as us and then enslave us, like in Planet of the Apes. Growinga large brain, which is associated with intelligence, would involve directingenergy away from growing big muscles, for example. In the unstable, dangerous,but relatively intellectually undemanding environment of chimpanzees—where basicneeds like warmth or food are met—this would be damaging. So, there would be noselection for super-intelligent chimps—instead an optimum level of intelligencewould be maintained."},{"pageContent":"Hunter-GatherersMoving on from chimpanzees, this combination of social, sexual, and naturalselection for intelligence and health is very obvious in the least developedhuman social organisations: hunter-gatherers. These peoples mainly live offforaging from the local environment and, occasionally, meat brought into thecommunity by male hunters. In some cases, they have developed very primitiveforms of agriculture, tending a small garden in territory they regard as theirown. But, in general, territory is held collectively by the band.[11][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-11]These groups are unstable, often splitting into separate groups over minorarguments, and they have very high levels of child mortality. Around 50% ofchildren die from accidents or poor resistance to disease. In addition, in manyof these tribes, such as the Yanomamö of Venezuela, unhealthy or simply unwantedinfants will be killed by their mothers or allowed to starve. There is also atendency for stepfathers, who may even have killed the father in a fight andtaken his wife, to kill young stepchildren.[12][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-12] For all of these reasons, in thegroups from which modern humans evolved there is selection in favour of theappropriate level of strength, aggression, and good genetic health.But we can also see how there would be selection for intelligence. Partnerintelligence does not seem to be considered significant for short-termrelationships. In the latter case, physical qualities which betoken good genetichealth are what is most important. However, when looking for somebody with whomto have a long-term relationship—where children might result, forexample—females are more interested in males’ social status (and by extensionhis intelligence) than vice versa. This is likely because a male of high statuswill, in general, be more able, and more willing, to invest resources in thefemale and her offspring.[13] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-13] Andshe will benefit from this investment when she is pregnant and has youngchildren, meaning that she and the children will be more likely to survive.Accordingly, the female (and her offspring) will be more likely to pass on theirgenes. For this reason, there are sex differences in the qualities that we findattractive in partners. Although there are all kinds of shades of grey inbetween, overall it really is true that men go for looks and women go for moneyand status or the potential to achieve these.[14][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-14] Men go for looks because they haveless to lose from the sexual encounter. Thus, unless they intend to invest inthe family, their best strategy is to have sex with as many healthy andfertile—and thus good-looking and young—women as possible.14In order to understand this selection for intelligence more, let’s focus on theYanomamö or, as other tribes term them, ‘the fierce people’. They are a group ofabout 35,000 people living in up to 250 separate villages on theBrazil–Venezuela border. They are extremely violent, with men settling disputesby smashing each other on top of the head with logs until one of them losesconsciousness or dies. This leaves the heads of the males as a mass of scarswhich they show off as evidence of their fortitude. The hierarchy is clearlybased around access to females. The ‘headman’ will have about three wives androughly eight children, while lower ranking men will have one or even no wivesand a smaller number of children.[15][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-15] This means that only the strongest,healthiest, and most intelligent men will make a significant impact on the genepool. As Darwin put it, in describing these kinds of tribes:‘The strongest and most vigorous men, those who could best defend and hunt fortheir families, and, in later times, the chiefs or headmen, would have succeededin leaving a greater number of offspring than would the weaker, poorer and lowermembers of the same tribes. The chiefs of nearly every tribe throughout theworld succeed in obtaining more than one wife.’[16][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-16]This can also be seen among the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, who live insmall bands and migrate from one watering hole to another. One study of thisgroup found that infant mortality was 45%, and that 62% of adult males producedno children at all. There is an excess of females, due to male deaths on huntingtrips, and, as such, the headman will have an excess of wives.[17][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-17] Reviews of hunter-gatherers allagree that most of these peoples follow status-based polygamous matingsystems.[18] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-18]We are not aware of any intelligence test which proves that the headman would becleverer than his subordinates, but there’s certainly good circumstantialevidence that this is the case. One of the means by which men in these tribesattract women is by being good at hunting. They can use the (rare) meat theyobtain on hunting trips as presents for those they like, or as food for theirchildren. The anthropologist Janet Siskind explains in her ethnography of theSharanahua of Peru that: ‘Prestige accrues to the generous hunter. Prestige isnot a vague goal at Marcos, it brings a definite reward, the possibility ofgaining women as lovers and/or wives. The successful hunter is usually thewinner in the competition for women.’[19][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-19] Such abilities would also impressthe males whom they would hope to lead. But, clearly, skill at hunting wouldinvolve not just good physical health but also intelligence. The ability to hitthe target or make the best weapons would be predicted by spatial intelligenceand lightning reaction times. Building and maintaining the weapons would requirehigh impulse control and planning for the future. Reaching the top of thehierarchy would require the social skill involved in making alliances andunderstanding the best time to pose a challenge, while good verbal intelligencewould be necessary to persuade rival males or outdo them in tests of wit. So, wewould expect the headmen to have relatively high intelligence by the standardsof the tribe, and it would be these very people who would be disproportionatelypassing on their genes.This view is backed up by qualitative evidence from anthropologists, who havelived with these hunter-gatherers. Napoleon Chagnon is an Americananthropologist who did long-term ethnographic fieldwork with the Yanomamö in the1960s. In his ethnography, he writes: ‘Kaobawa, on the other hand, has thespecial status of being the group’s headman ... Kaobawa thinks for the others inthe village, many of whom are not able to perceive some of the less obviousimplications of situations. In political matters, he is the most astute man inthe group, but he so diplomatically exercises his influence that others are notoffended.’[20] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-20] Kaobawa is stronglyimplied to be the most intelligent man in the village. American evolutionarypsychologist David Buss has summarized that, ‘In tribal societies, the headmanor leaders are inevitably among the most intelligent in the group.’[21][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-21]We must also think in terms of group selection—i.e. where selection operates ongroups of individuals. Chagnon found that the Yanomamö and similarhunter-gatherer groups are in a constant state of war against rival villages.This being the case, if the level of aggression were roughly similar then wewould expect the healthier and more intelligent of the two villages to triumphand slaughter the males from the other village. This would be an obvious exampleof ‘group selection’. This is because the more intelligent village would developsuperior war strategies, produce better weapons, and engage in better planning."},{"pageContent":"PastoralistsPastoralists are nomadic peoples who keep a variety of domesticated animals suchas goats and chickens. They frequently migrate from place to place in order tofind fresh pastures for their herds. They are a more complex form of societythan that of hunter-gatherers; they reflect a greater degree of specialisation,and there are clearer differences in social status within these groups. Thesedifferences strongly impact whether or not people have children and we havealready noted that social status is partly predicted by intelligence.The first pastoralists appeared in Neolithic times, around 10,000 years ago, inthe so-called ‘Fertile Crescent’ on the shores of the Mediterranean.Pastoralists can sustain larger populations than hunter-gatherers because theycan produce a surplus of food in order to feed these larger populations. Amodern example of such a people is the Rendille camel herders of Northern Kenya.In this society, there is very strong selection both for physical prowess andintelligence. At the age of around 11, a boy undergoes a bloody rite of passage,in public, in order to transition from being a boy to being a warrior. He mustsit perfectly still as he is circumcised. If he betrays the slightest emotionthen he will shame his family and himself. At best he will be an outcast, whocannot marry, and, at worst, he will be killed by his furious and humiliatedrelatives. Clearly, this would select for physical prowess and thus good health.Once the male graduates to warrior status, he can get married, but only once hecan pay the ‘bride price’, which is paid in camels. Only about 50% of Rendillemales ever accrue enough camels to be able to pay the bride price, and so, ingeneral, only the more socioeconomically successful males will father childrenat all.[22] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-22] We have already seenthat socioeconomic status is predicted by intelligence, so this system wouldhave the indirect effect of preventing those of both low intelligence and poorhealth from having children.A number of these pastoralist peoples have become agriculturalists. This meansthat there is even greater surplus and so an even larger population, thoughthere will tend to be a greater concentration on one particular kind of crop.There are hundreds of studies of these kinds of people and almost all concurthat there are polygamous mating systems through which the wealthier malesachieve the highest fertility. In addition, there are arduous rites of passagewhich weed out the males who are low in physical health. Accordingly, there isselection for intelligence and physical vigour. We would, in fact, expectselection for intelligence to be stronger among agriculturalists than amonghunter-gatherers. To pursue agriculture successfully, you require far higherimpulse control and a much stronger degree of orientation towards the future,such that you can achieve a surplus, ready for times of famine. As you aresettled, and cannot move with the seasons, you have to keep warm and thusmanufacture appropriate clothes and more complex and versatile dwellingstructures. In order to marry, you must be highly successful in agriculture,being able to pay the bride price, and this would require far higherintelligence—as reflected by the heightened ability to plan and practiseself-discipline—than would hunting ability.[23][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-23]"},{"pageContent":"Early Nation StatesAs agriculture improved further, such a large food surplus could be achievedthat there was no need for everybody to even work in agriculture. Increasingnumbers of people were able to pursue specialisms that had nothing to do withagriculture directly or simply employ others to work on their land while theylived a life of ease. As such, around 5,000 years ago we begin to see thedevelopment of city states, especially around the Fertile Crescent. A clearsocial class system develops. At the top, there are the kings, the nobility, andthe leading religious and military figures, then there are the wealthy farmers,merchants, and craftsmen, then there are labourers and poorer farmers, and atthe very bottom are slaves who are literally owned by members of the higherclasses. These societies were generally polygamous and there is sound evidencethat members of the higher social classes enjoyed many wives and extremely highfertility.[24] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-24]We need look no further than the Old Testament in search of evidence for this.King Solomon (c.990–931 BC) ran a harem of around a thousand sexual partners:‘King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’sdaughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. They were fromnations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarrywith them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.”Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. He had seven hundred wives ofroyal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.’ (IKings, 11)Other Old Testament kings also had very high numbers of wives, though nothing tomatch Solomon. King Rehoboam of Judah, for example, had 18 wives and 60concubines. Among the Incas of Peru there were legal regulations on the extentof polygamy. Emperors could have as many wives and concubines as they desiredwhile military officers were permitted between 30 and 15, depending on theirrank.[25] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-25] In China, emperorsmaintained harems of hundreds of women who would be rotated according to theirtime in the menstrual cycle. As such, they would have hundreds of children.[26][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-26] It is recorded that the Moroccanemperor Moulay Ishmael the Bloodthirsty (1634–1727) fathered 888 children. Thesewere produced by hundreds of concubines and 9 wives, including ‘Mrs Shaw, anIrish woman’ who was taken as a slave by Barbary pirates during a raid on hernative land.[27] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-27]As the societies become more complex, the social differences become greater,which leads to another form of selection both for intelligence and health. Theupper classes simply had considerably better access to nutritious food than thelower classes, who would eat a poor diet, be close to starvation, and live invery unhealthy conditions. Many studies have compared skeletons from higher andlower class graves and demonstrated that the upper class skeletons displayedevidence of better nutrition and were also taller, because they had been able toreach their maximum genotypic height due to good nutrition. Among the Maya inCentral America, upper class skeletons were, on average, 7cm taller than lowerclass skeletons.[28] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-28] Thisassociation between social class and height can also be seen in Early ModernEngland. The average sailor on the English ship The Mary Rose, which sank in1545, was 5ft 7 inches tall.[29] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-29]However, Henry VIII was 6ft 3 inches,[30][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-30] Edward IV, Henry’s grandfather, was6ft 3-and-a-half inches,[31] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-31] andMary, Queen of Scots was almost 6ft.[32][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-32] These significant differences innutrition would have had a direct effect on the ability to conceive, on thelikelihood that a child would survive into adulthood, and on life expectancy.They would have meant that there was a form of social selection in favour of thewealthy and, therefore, in favour of the more intelligent. And this would havebeen in addition to the impact of sexual selection, with upper class men havinggreater access to females. Thus, it can be argued that intelligence would bemore strongly selected for in these early states than was the case amongagriculturalists or pastoralists, as a consequence of the development of asocial class system with significant differences in living standards."},{"pageContent":"The Christian WorldIn some respects, the adoption of Christianity by the Roman Empire may beregarded as damaging to selection for intelligence, and we will explore possiblereasons for the fall of the Roman Empire in Chapter Eleven. Christianity beganas a religion of the poor and dispossessed and, thus, it made sense to espousemonogamy, as this was in the interests of the poor. Under a system of polygamy,as we have seen, the wealthier men will monopolise the females, leaving lowstatus men unable to pass on their genes. As such, the adoption of monogamy bythe Roman Catholic Church would have decreased the intensity of selection forintelligence.Secondly, clerical celibacy was imposed by the Council of Carthage around theyear 400, though it had been strongly encouraged as early as 306. Those who werealready priests were banned from getting married, or having sex with their wivesif they were already married.[33] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-33]Priests would have been among the most educated, and thus the most intelligent,people in the society at the time and so imposing celibacy upon them would haveweakened selection for intelligence. Some priests did sire illegitimate childrenanyway, as we will explore shortly.Thirdly, the Church prohibited abortion, which would have led to the births ofmany—often illegitimate—children from unwanted pregnancies.[34][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-34] These would be more likely to be thechildren of those of relatively low intelligence who had acted in the moment andnot considered the future consequences. However, this may be balanced by thefact that the Church also banned contraception, to the extent that Europe simplylost the knowledge of it. The more intelligent would have been more efficient inusing this than the less intelligent. It is widely accepted in the medicalliterature that those of low intelligence are at most inefficient users ofcontraception.[35] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-35] The moreintelligent may even have been more inclined to use it because, due to beingwealthier, it is probable that they would have experienced lower levels ofinfant mortality.[36] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-36]However, in spite of this, there is evidence that the selection for wealthcontinued in the form of de facto polygamy. Despite the official monogamy, thenobility would generally have mistresses in addition to their wives; oftenservant girls working in their households. William the Conqueror, who invadedEngland in 1066, was the illegitimate son of Robert, Duke of Normandy, andsucceeded his father to the Dukedom. Until the Reformation, it was so sociallyacceptable for the upper class to have illegitimate children by mistresses thatthese ‘noble bastards’ or ‘royal bastards’ would be acknowledged by theirfather, take their father’s surname, be raised in his household, and be providedfor by him, often lavishly. Historians Katharine Carlton and Tim Thorntonexamined 876 wills from northern England made over the period 1450 to 1640. Ofthese, 11% had specifically marked illegitimate beneficiaries. Of these 96wills, 8 belonged to nobles, 27 to knights, 23 to esquires, and 38 togentlemen—the latter three being the ranks of the gentry, the English ‘lowernobility’, in descending order.[37] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-37]The historian Stephen Staves has noted that upper class men in Early ModernEngland would generally have ‘roughly as many illegitimate children aslegitimate ones’.[38] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-38]Even among the supposedly celibate clergy, who were generally of relatively highsocial status, there were many cases of priests fathering children. In 1535, itwas reported that the Abbot of Norton, in Cheshire, was not resident at NortonAbbey. He lived with his mistress and had fathered children by her. BishopEdmund Bonner (c.1500–1569), notorious for persecuting Protestants in Englandduring the bloody reign of Queen Mary I (1553–1558), was the bastard son of theRector of Davenham, in Cheshire, and this rector was himself the illegitimateson of a knight.[39] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-39] Bonner himselffathered two illegitimate sons.[40] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-40]Cardinal Wolsey, who was Henry VIII’s chief minister in the first half of hisreign, had an illegitimate son.[41] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-41]Pope Alexander VI (1431–1503) had four of them, and the infamous Lucrezia Borgia(1480–1519) was his illegitimate daughter.[42][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-42] Thus, there is evidence that even inthe pre-Modern, Christian world a form of de facto polygamy continued such thatthe upper class could have pronounced fertility compared to the lower classes.However, it is as we move into the Early Modern Era—with increased recordkeeping—that we can find direct evidence that the richer half of the populationhad much higher fertility than the poorer half."},{"pageContent":"Fertility in the Early Modern EraFrom around the beginning of the 17th century, most English parishes began tokeep systematic parish records of baptisms, marriages, and burials. Someparishes, right from the beginning, kept very detailed records, including thenames of the child’s parents on the baptism record and the name of the father inthe case of an infant burial. The survival of wills, proved by parish courts, issketchy in the 16th century, but is relatively comprehensive by the 17th. Assuch, we now have a series of fascinating studies that give us real proof thatthe richer had higher fertility than the poorer in Early Modern England andelsewhere in Europe too.The most detailed of these studies was produced by the British economist GregoryClark, of the University of California at Davis. It was reported in his book AFarewell to Alms. Clark shows, drawing upon 1,978 wills from Suffolk and Essex,in the east of England, made between the years 1585 and 1638, that the richer50% of English testators had almost twice as many surviving children as thepoorer 50%.[43] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-43] The completedfertility of the richer half was 40% higher than that of the poorer half. Willsextended well down the social hierarchy. In Suffolk, in the 1620s, 39% of maleswho died aged over 16 left wills and many belonged to what was then known as the‘lower sort’: labourers, small scale farmers, junior craftsmen, and servants.Analysing the wills and comparing them to the parish records, Clark found that,if we divide the testators into the ‘richer half’ (those leaving the averageestate of £100 or more) and the ‘poorer half’, then: ‘A richer man married fortwenty or more years fathered 9.2 children while a poorer man would have only6.4, an advantage to the rich of over 40%.’[44][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-44]Those bequeathing less than £9 had fewer than two children whereas those leaving£1,000 or more had at least four. Around 14% of the poorest left all theirwealth to those not genetically related to them. This is compared to only 2% ofthose with over £1,000 who left all their money to non-relatives. This negativerelationship between wealth and bequeathing to friends implies, argues Clark,that the poorer testators were, the more likely they were to have no childrenand even no surviving relatives at all. Though the relationship is not soclearly linear, wealth also predicts the number of grandchildren bequeathed toin wills. And these poorer testators are themselves 50% more fertile than the60% of adults who didn’t leave wills. By 1650, testators had 1.5 childrencompared to 1 for non-testators. So the very poor, who didn’t leave wills, hadfewer children even than the poorest testators.Clark is not the only person to have unearthed this pattern, though his researchis the most extensive. In 1978, historian Victor Skipp (1925–2010) found, from asample of Warwickshire parish records between 1560 and 1670, that the ‘middleclass’ (the richer half) had, on average, four children while the ‘workingclass’ (the poorer half) had three.[45][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-45] This was ‘children baptised’ ratherthan ‘completed fertility’, meaning that, as 45% of children tended to die ininfancy, some of the poorest may have ended up with no surviving children atall. In fact, in 1972, historian John Pound found, drawing upon Norfolk records,that between 1500 and 1630 completed fertility was four for the middle class andtwo for the working class, giving the middle class a fertility advantage of100%.[46] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-46] A similar pattern has beenunearthed in many other pre-industrial European societies. For example,according to research by German historian and psychologist Volkmar Weiss, inSaxony between 1547 and 1671, the middle class, on average, had 3.4 children whogot married while the working class had 1.6 who did so.[47][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-47] See Table 3.Table 3.

This would seem to imply that the poor werepurposefully having fewer children, or that more of their children didn’tsurvive long enough to be christened.So, the 17th century continued to see the pattern, which we see even inpastoralist tribes. Clark has termed it the ‘Survival of the Richest’. Thewealthier half of the population were simply more fertile—they left moresurviving children—than the poorer half of society, and there were furthergradations in favour of the richer even within the ‘rich’ category. In addition,the rich had a far longer life expectancy than the poor. For example, data from17th-century Geneva shows that the upper class lived, on average, until the ageof 35.9, the middle class until 24.7, and the working class until 18.3. This isillustrated in Table 4.Table 4. Age of death and social class (Lynn, 2011, p. 46).CityPeriodUpperMiddleLowerBerlin1710–179929.824.320.3Geneva17th c35.924.718.3Rouen18th c32.533.024.5Neuruppin1732–183033.228.628.9This would mean that the poor simply had less time to have children and thiswould be compounded by the fact that, by the Early Modern Era, the average ageof marriage in Western Europe was relatively late; around 27 for men and around26 for women.[48] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-48] This meant around25% of people never married and, among men, these were likely to have been theless socioeconomically successful.[49][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-49]The high child mortality rate, of around 45%, meant that the population grewonly very slowly. Indeed, when it grew too high—higher than the capacity of theland to be able to sustain it—then there would be widespread famine and thepopulation would dramatically decline. The consequence of this was that Englandand other European societies were characterised by a system of constant socialdescent. Every generation, those at the bottom of the hierarchy would die off,without children, and those one step up the ladder would, by necessity, movedownwards in order to take their place. In general, the younger sons of thegentry would fall into the ‘middling sort’. They would become yeoman farmers,who, on average, weren’t as wealthy as the gentry and would do some farm labourthemselves.[50] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-50] Or these youngergentry might become merchants, but, either way, they would work for a living.The younger sons of merchants would become craftsmen and the younger sons ofyeomen would be husbandmen, meaning they would take to the plough themselves.The younger sons of craftsmen and husbandmen would be cottagers, who wouldsupplement a smallholding with day labour on the farms of others; and theyounger sons of smallholders would simply be labourers. And below these were thedestitute and the starving.As such, we would expect that the qualities that made people socioeconomicallysuccessful—including highly genetic qualities such as intelligence—would begrowing in the population every generation. The genes for being rich—which issignificantly predicted by intelligence, and which is strongly heritable, as wehave seen—were being selected for under the harshness of pre-industrialconditions. We would predict that people would have been becoming moreintelligent; the average IQ of pre-industrial society would have increased everygeneration.With the rise of the internet, researching your family history has becomeextremely popular. Before the internet, it was a time consuming and costly hobbyinvolving lots of trips to London or the relevant local archive. Now, manyrecords can be searched online and they are combed through by enthusiasticamateur historians, often in the search for ‘interesting’ ancestors, inspired bythe BBC television programme Who Do You Think You Are? In this programme,celebrities have their family trees traced and they always uncover somefascinating story or other. However, this illusion of everyone having anintriguing family past is achieved by broadcasting only the more dramaticcases[51] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-51] and by tracing everypossible line until something that might make good television reveals itself. Inreality, most people trace their paternal line and the results are depressinglypredictable. If you are English, you probably won’t be able to get beyond themid-16th century, because that’s when the English parish records begin. And youwill very likely find that you are descended from 16th-century ‘yeomen’ orpossibly ‘gentlemen’; very wealthy farmers. The reason is simple. It was thesepeople whose offspring survived."},{"pageContent":"Executing the Less IntelligentClearly, ‘Survival of the more Intelligent’ characterised pre-industrialsocieties. Those who were less intelligent lived in poorer conditions and fewerof their children survived. But there was also a more direct selection pressureagainst those of low intelligence, which began to manifest itself in theMedieval Era: execution. In an article, which by its very nature arousedcontroversy, Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost and American anthropologistHenry Harpending (1944–2016) examined the way in which judicial violence actedas a selection pressure in pre-industrial Europe.[52][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-52] Up until the 11th century, theynote, execution was not widely employed, because the Church was opposed to it,law enforcement was rudimentary, and it was believed that people should have theright to settle their own disputes. But as the Medieval Era progressed, theChurch accepted that the ‘wicked’ should be executed so that the ‘good’ couldlive in peace. By the Early Modern Era, all felonies carried the death penaltyand this meant that up to 1% of the male population of Europe was executed eachgeneration, with roughly another 1% dying at the scene of the crime or in prisonwhile awaiting trial. Most of these felons were young men.Frost and Harpending argue that this process would have altered the nature ofWestern personality, by preventing those with high psychopathic personality (thecriminally-inclined) from passing on their genes. This is likely the case, andthey argue that it is evidenced in the way that the murder rate falls. But, asEdward Dutton and Swedish psychologist Guy Madison have noted, it also hasimplications for intelligence.[53] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-53]Those who were executed or died in prison were overwhelmingly poor anduneducated. In England, those who were of high social status could fundrelatively luxurious conditions in prison and, unless their crime was treason orheresy, they could avoid execution by pleading ‘Benefit of the Clergy’. Inessence, this meant that if they could read then they would avoid execution. Italso meant that it was disproportionately those of low intelligence who went tothe gallows. In addition, we have already seen that, in general, intelligence isnegatively associated with criminality and we might expect this association tobe particularly strong when the punishment for felony is death. This would meanthat judicial execution was very likely playing a role in boosting Europeanintelligence by removing some of the least intelligent young men everygeneration."},{"pageContent":"Upward Social Mobility in the Early Modern EraWe know that, in pre-industrial England, the rich half of the population hadhigher fertility than the poorer half and there is evidence that intelligencewas a major reason for this, even then. This can be better understood if we lookat the nature of social mobility in Medieval and Early Modern England. Manypeople believe that social mobility is a modern phenomenon and that yourchildhood social status pretty much dictated your life further back in history.But this is simply untrue. Gregory Clark has charted the rise and fall ofparticular families over time, by focusing on those with unusual surnames. Inhis book The Son Also Rises (Clark likes Hemingway puns) Clark presents data forassorted countries including England, Japan, the US, China, Sweden, and India.Clark notes that social mobility, in modern times, is often assumed to be highbecause there is a weak correlation, of around 0.3, between the income of parentand child. But this is problematic because there are different measures ofstatus: wealth, education, and occupational status, for example. People can maketrade-offs between these measures. A teacher would have higher occupationalstatus than a plumber but may well earn less. In addition, argues Clark, becausethe factors which affect social status are likely to be strongly genetic, therewill be random fluctuation when comparing father and son. As such, it is betterto compare surnames—and thus families—across time.[54][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-54]In England, for example, Clark argues that you can tell the historical socialstatus of a family by the kind of surname they have. High status surnames arethose which are Norman (such as those that end in ‘ville’) or those which are‘locative’—the names of places. People with these surnames are descended fromNormans who took the name of their feudal manor. Surnames which refer to aprofession—Bailey, Cooper, Thatcher—are middle ranking, while low rankingsurnames tend to end in ‘son’, be the name of the father, refer to physicalappearance (e.g. ‘Brown’), or relate to the part of the village a person livedin, such as ‘Hill’. Assessing the data between the medieval period and 2012,Clark finds that across the period, and even now, those with Norman or locativenames are over-represented among proxies for high social status. These includeOxbridge graduates, barristers, and physicians. Those with low status surnamesare under-represented. Over this period, Clark emphasises, there has been agradual ‘regression to the mean’. This means that those at the representationextremes have moved closer to the average over time, so that Normans are lessover-represented than they used to be and Saxons are less under-represented thanthey used to be.Clark provides a number of explanations for this. Something akin to regressionto the mean happens in genetics. Owing to the large number of genes involved, itsometimes (though rarely) happens that children are significantly more (or less)‘socially competent’ (Clark’s term for the ability to achieve high socioeconomicstatus) than their parents. They then marry a person with comparable abilitiesand move up (or down) the social hierarchy. Alternatively, a person with highgenotypic ‘ability’ marries a person with high phenotypic ‘ability’. Finally, aspre-modern fertility was predicted by high social status, Norman surnames wouldhave to spread downwards through the population.Overall, Clark finds that social status across history is around 0.75 heritable,its heritability is the same now as it was in Medieval England, and suddenshocks that might raise social status very quickly—such as winning theLottery—wear off within a few generations. This implies that ability is requiredto maintain wealth and a person of low ability who is born into a wealthy familywill likely squander his or her inheritance. This movement towards the mean, interms of surnames and status, implies that something is being selected for inall classes, and this is likely intelligence, though Clark doesn’t look directlyat this trait. Interestingly, Clark finds the same results in countries that arefar more egalitarian than Britain, such as Sweden. Dividing between the surnamesof the higher nobility, the surnames of the untitled nobility, Latin surnames(historically adopted by the highly educated non-noble), geographical surnames(e.g. Berg), and the lowest status surnames (those ending in ‘son’), Clark findsa similar pattern to England. Those with noble and Latin surnames are stillover-represented at the top universities, amongst the richest, and in the topprofessions, and the heritability of social status is about 0.75.So, even in Medieval England, social status was 0.75 heritable, roughly the sameextent to which intelligence is heritable. Something allowed the children of thepoor, who by the randomness of genetics were much more intelligent than theirparents, to move up the hierarchy, become rich, and have lots of survivingchildren. Clearly, the best candidate for this would be high intelligence asthis is a highly significant predictor of socioeconomic success. It is alsostrongly heritable. Another candidate would be high ‘Conscientiousness’, apersonality trait which is also heritable, as we will see in Chapter Five. TheMedieval world created conditions whereby those who did not become rich wouldnot pass on their genes and you became rich if you had the necessaryintelligence and personality-type, which a minority of people born outside theelite always did, just by genetic chance.All societies had social mobility, even India with its formerly rigid castesystem.[55] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-55] The highly intelligent,born to poor families, would gradually rise to the top, even if it took a fewgenerations. The rise would often be slow, due to nepotism, but where there wasa crisis—such as many noble families being killed off in the Black Death or theWars of the Roses or a power vacuum created, such as by the Dissolution of theMonasteries—then social ascent could be dramatic. Indeed, precisely becausemedieval society was less meritocratic, intelligence and diligence were likelymore equally distributed across social classes, meaning there were always peoplefrom modest backgrounds who could socially ascend. In an extreme meritocracy,intelligence will be concentrated in the higher classes and because it is highlyheritable there will be very little social mobility.[56][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-56] Poor boys could also move swiftly upthe hierarchy by being so obviously able, at school for example, that it wouldbe impossible to hold them back.British psychologist Richard Lynn has explored the various ways they could risefurther.[57] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-57] These ways includedbecoming successful merchants; lawyers, clergymen (many of whom had illegitimatechildren), administrators (such as the stewards of feudal estates), andsoldiers, and this was the case throughout Medieval Europe.[58][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-58] These paths to riches would allrequire high intelligence. Likewise, notes Lynn, highly able females couldsocially ascend via advantageous marriages, with the wooing of a high statusmale being likely to involve a high degree of intelligence (even if this was notwhat attracted the high status male to the much lower status female). A minorityof women, however, if they became widows, could start to become wealthy in theirown right. In addition, females could rise in status by becoming the mistressesof high status males. As we have discussed, the resultant children wouldgenerally be raised in the father’s household and be relatively well providedfor. In the 17th century, about 11% of males reached a higher ‘rank’—Englishsociety was composed of a series of ranks that were based around a combinationof wealth and lifestyle—than their fathers.[59][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-59]Social mobility was plainly significant and it is clear from looking at theroutes via which it occurred—the law, administration—that intelligence wouldhave been the guiding factor. The history of Early Modern England is litteredwith men from ‘modest’ backgrounds who reached great heights, especially (asalready mentioned) in the wake of social crises, such as the War of theRoses.[60] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-60] Henry VIII’s chiefminister in the first part of his reign was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530).He was the son of an Ipswich butcher. Wolsey excelled at school and went toOxford to train as a priest. He eventually became chaplain to the Archbishop ofCanterbury and, in this position, he came to the attention of Henry VII, to whomhe also became chaplain. His rise continued under Henry VIII and by 1515 Wolseywas Lord Chancellor.[61] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-61] Wolsey’sown protégé, who effectively succeeded him, was Thomas Cromwell (c.1485–1540),the son of a blacksmith and brewer, from Putney Heath, a place now on theoutskirts of London, then notorious for highwaymen. He ran away to the Continentand became a mercenary soldier and administrator, fluent in many languages. By1512, he was a London attorney and by 1516 he was working for Wolsey. By 1534,Cromwell was the king’s chief minister.[62][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-62]Social mobility from relative poverty to wealth happened in all societies, andintelligence is a significant factor behind this mobility. In 1825, in England,20% of men with working class fathers entered middle class professions.[63][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-63] It has been found that 31% ofChinese mandarins—civil servants, selected for their intelligence and diligencethrough competitive examination—between 1371 and 1904, came from ordinarybackgrounds.[64] [part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-64]"},{"pageContent":"IllegitimatesSo, in pre-industrial England, wealth predicted fertility and the way youobtained or maintained wealth was partly through high intelligence. At the otherend of the social scale Lynn observes that there is evidence that those who hadparticularly low intelligence would be especially likely to not pass on theirgenes. In general, illegitimacy—especially in the form of single motherhood—isassociated with low status and, so, low intelligence. It has been calculatedthat in the US white American single mothers have an average IQ of 92, whereasit is 105 for women who are childless or married with children. We have seenthat education level is a proxy for intelligence. Research from the USA hasfound that women with no high school education are 20 times more likely to endup as single mothers than are women with a high school education.[65][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-65]In pre-industrial Europe there was no welfare state. Indeed, this generallydidn’t develop until the second half of the 20th century. As such, singlemothers would tend to abandon unwanted babies. In Ancient Rome they were placedin sewers, in the hope, perhaps, that a passing Samaritan might take pity.[66][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-66] In the early 19th century, inLondon, it was not uncommon to see dead babies in the streets or in rubbishdumps. By the 18th century, the number of abandoned babies was so great in manyEuropean cities that orphanages were established to house them. In 1741, theThomas Coram hospital for foundlings was opened in London. However, due to thelack of wet nurses, 71% of these foundlings were dead by the age of 15, whereasit was roughly 40% in the general population. Due to insufficient wet nurses,foundlings were malnourished and acutely vulnerable to infectious disease.[67][part0006_split_012.html#footnote-69146-67] Thus, in pre-modern societies, notesLynn, illegitimate children of single mothers, who would have been of lowintelligence, suffered very high mortality. Each generation, this would haveacted to stop genes for low intelligence spreading through the population.1 [part0006_split_001.html#footnote-69146-1-backlink] For more discussion on theevolutionary origins of rape, see: Thornhill, R. & Palmer, C.T.

Females, indeed, may actually trade ‘provision’ for ‘status’ in apotential partner. But, overall, the qualities which lead to males having highstatus, such as intelligence, will also render them more caring in the sense ofbeing more cooperative and socially skilled, as we have already discussed.14 [part0006_split_005.html#footnote-69146-14-backlink] Buss, D.

As we have already mentioned, theranks were a combination of wealth and lifestyle, rather like modern day socialclass. So, usually a ‘yeoman’ was not as wealthy as a ‘gentleman’, but thiswasn’t necessarily the case. Someone who lived in genteel poverty was morelikely to be regarded as a gentleman than a very wealthy farmer who was frugaland did some labour himself.

Gregory Clark, though he does not explicitlytalk about intelligence, has amassed very good evidence that intelligence wasnonetheless continuously increasing in the pre-industrial era in A Farwell toAlms.[1] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-1] He has done this bygathering proxies for intelligence and showing that, across history, they seemto change in precisely the direction that would be predicted if intelligence wasindeed going up. These proxies are interest rates, literacy, numeracy, andjudicial violence."},{"pageContent":"Interest RatesInterest rates can be regarded as a marker of intelligence because they measuretime preference. We have already seen that ‘time preference’ is associated withintelligence. More intelligent people are more focused on the future than areless intelligent people. As such, a smaller reward, given relatively furtherinto the future, is sufficient to persuade a more intelligent person to postponeimmediate gratification. It follows from this that if you asked a lessintelligent person to lend you some money, they would be profoundly concernedabout the immediate consequence of this, which would be them having slightlyless money here and now. In order to persuade them to lend you the money, youwould have to offset this by allowing them to charge you a very high level ofinterest. If they could only charge you a low level of interest then, from theirperspective, the reward of the low level of interest would be too small,relative to the length of time they would have to wait for it and so beungratified, to matter. It would be outweighed by the fact that they would bepostponing gratification here and now. In essence, the more intelligent a personis, the less of a return they require on their investment to bother making theinvestment.This can also be seen with something as simple as how you spend your money. VivNicholson (1936–2015) was moderately famous in the UK and was immortalised inthe musical Spend, Spend, Spend! Though seemingly good at art, there is everyindication that she was not especially bright. She was raised in extreme povertyin Yorkshire, as the daughter of an unemployed miner. She became pregnant at 16and had five children, four of whom died as children. However, in 1961, she won£152,319—about £3 million in today’s money—on the football pools. Asked by atabloid journalist what she would do with the money she replied, ‘Spend! Spend!Spend!’[2] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-2] By 1965, she was bankrupt.She simply had no ability to postpone gratification for the sake of the future.Interest rates, then, are a marker of intelligence. Clark’s research has shownthat between 1200 and 1800 in England interest rates significantly fell. Basedon land return and rent return, interest rates in the year 1200 were over 10%and, in fact, in 1150 they were around 15%. By 1800, they had fallen to just 5%.Of course, there are all kinds of localised reasons why interest rates mighthave fallen—and fallen so much—over this period. Our point is simply that itfits with the hypothesis that people were becoming more intelligent—and thusbetter able to defer gratification. The decline in interest rates can be seen inFigure 2.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\first graph.png [../images/00002.jpeg]Figure 2. Return on land and on rent charges by decade in England, 1170–2003.[3][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-3]"},{"pageContent":"Literacy and NumeracyClearly, literacy and numeracy are significant components to intelligence.‘Linguistic aptitude’ is an important component of intelligence and, so, themore intelligent you are the easier you will find it to learn to read.Intelligence correlates with ‘Intellect’ (see Chapter Five)—being interested inideas. The more intelligent you are, the higher your intellect will be and thusthe more of an incentive you will have to learn to read. As for learning towrite, there will be clear benefits to learning to do this in terms of keepingrecords and accounts and these will become more necessary as society becomesmore complex and specialised, which would potentially be a sign of itsincreasing intelligence. In addition, writing—especially with a quill—is acomplex skill involving fine motor skills and patience, both qualitiesassociated with more intelligent people. Furthermore, the wealthy would be morelikely to be able to educate their children and those children would be moreable to accrue wealth by being educated. It is, therefore, no surprise thatClark found a relationship between literacy and social status in his sample ofwills. 94% of the gentry could sign their wills, 88% of merchants, 53% ofyeomen, 26% of husbandmen, but only 17% of labourers. So, we would expectliteracy to be a proxy for intelligence.The same would be true of numeracy. More intelligent people would be better atmaths and the kind of work they engaged in, such as business, would alsonecessitate the greater use of mathematics. Undeveloped societies have littleuse for mathematics. Clark notes that a good marker of numeracy is ageawareness. By 1800, most people in Western Europe had a fairly accurateunderstanding of how old they were. However, this is not the case in illiterateand innumerate societies. In the 4th century AD, a survey indicated that 80% ofRoman office holders—highly important people—knew their age. In 18th-centuryParis, only 15% of people were of unknown age. In 15th-century Florence, awealthy city, 32% of people did not know how old they were. In the small town ofCorfe Castle in England, most of whose inhabitants were labourers, only 8% didnot know their age in 1790. This implies that English labourers around 1800 wereas numerate as late Roman office holders.For literacy, Clark turns to a combination of the percentage of grooms whosigned the marriage register when they married or the percentage of witnesses incourt cases who could sign depositions. These were traced between 1580 and 1920,in England, and showed a clear upward trend. For example, in 1740 about 60% ofEnglish men could sign their names but by 1920 it was close to 100%, graduallyincreasing, without a blip, from 1780. A similar process can be seen with femaleliteracy and literacy from specific bishoprics in narrower periods. Again,disruptive factors such as the English Civil War, for example, would interferewith the trend—because they would interfere with the education of children—butthere is a clear upward trend. Going back to Medieval England, it is clear thatliteracy was very low, to the extent that being able to read a passage from theBible in court, which meant you could avoid execution for felony, was known, asmentioned previously, as ‘Benefit of the Clergy’, as it was mainly only theclergy who could read. There is no sign that there were greater rewards forliteracy and numeracy in 1800 than in 1500; we simply became more educated. Thiswould reflect us becoming more intelligent. The rise in literacy can be seen inFigure 3.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00003.jpeg]Figure 3. Literacy in England, 1580–1920.[4][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-4]"},{"pageContent":"Judicial Violence and Blood SportsAn appetite for violence and cruelty is often a reflection of low intelligence.As we have discussed, the less intelligent are less able to empathise with thefeelings of others. Accordingly, we would expect to see a rise in intelligenceparallel a decline in barbarity. Although this is difficult to measure, a casecan be made that this is precisely what we see. A good example can be seen inthe cruelty inflicted on criminals. In Tudor England, the punishment for anyfelony was death by hanging. In London, in the 17th century these hangings—whichwere by slow strangulation rather than breaking the neck via a long drop—tookplace at Tyburn. There would be a party atmosphere along the route via which thecondemned were taken to the gallows. Effectively, the event was a kind of fair;a day out for the family.In the Early Modern Era in England, the punishment for heresy or treason, if youwere a woman, was to be burned alive. The punishment for high treason, if youwere a man, was to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. You would be dragged throughthe street on a hurdle, hanged, cut down while still alive (though, in practice,you’d usually be allowed to hang until you died), castrated, disembowelled,beheaded, and quartered. The head and quarters would then be displayed in publicuntil they rotted away. Of course, all the executions took place in public. In1536, the rebel leader Robert Aske, leader of the Pilgrimage of Grace (a hugeand very nearly successful uprising against Henry VIII), begged not to beexecuted in this way so, instead, he was hanged in chains until he died; hisbody left to decay.[5] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-5] And even thesekinds of punishments might seem benign compared to some of those enacted around500 years earlier when the punishment for poaching in the king’s forest was tobe blinded and castrated.[6] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-6] The samesociety that deployed these gruesome punishments enjoyed all forms of bloodsports, including cock fighting and bear baiting.[7][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-7]Through the course of the 18th and the early 19th century, these kinds ofsadistic punishments were abolished in England. The last hanging, drawing, andquartering occurred in 1782. The punishment of being burnt at the stake wasabolished in 1789. The gibbeting of executed criminals stopped in 1832. Cockfighting and bear baiting were banned in 1835. Public executions were stoppedaltogether in 1869. In essence, we became less cruel; less inclined to inflictvengeful and agonising punishment. This can be interpreted in many ways, but oneinterpretation is increasing intelligence. In addition to the measures discussedby Gregory Clark, there are a number of others which fit with the pattern heobserved."},{"pageContent":"The Size of the HeadHigher intelligence requires a bigger brain. Indeed, brain size tends to weaklycorrelate, at about 0.2 to 0.3, with IQ score; a relationship that is furtherevidence of the objectivity of IQ tests.[8][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-8] On average, the larger your brain is,the more intelligent you are. Large brains require large skulls and this beingso we would expect that the average size of people’s heads would have increasedsince, for example, the medieval period. A study, by W.P. Rock and hiscolleagues, has found that this is indeed the case. Comparing a sample of 31skulls from 13th-century London and 30 skulls that are representative of modernEnglish people, his group found that the dimensions of the cranial vault, whichhouses the brain, had increased by 10mm.[9][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-9]"},{"pageContent":"Democracy and Political StabilityWe have already seen that democracy is associated with relatively highintelligence at the level of individuals. Those of low IQ are less likely tovote for democratic parties or sustain democracy at all. This is becausedemocracy involves cooperation, low corruption, trust, and future orientation,all of which are associated to some extent with high intelligence. This beingthe case, we would expect to observe a process of greater democratisation andpolitical stability as we move towards the 18th century.Again, there is considerable evidence for this. Medieval England can hardly evenbe regarded as a functioning state in the modern sense. The king was an absolutemonarch, but he had little control outside of London. The provinces were ruledby local warlords—the feudal nobility—whose support for the king was required inorder to stay in power. When he lost this support, he would be toppled and evenif he wasn’t toppled he would frequently have to put down rebellions led bydisloyal warlords. Edward II was murdered in 1327, Richard II was murdered in1400, Henry VI was removed in 1461 and then again in 1471 after he retook power.He was murdered that time. Edward V was removed by his uncle Richard III and waslikely killed in 1483. Richard III died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485and was replaced by Henry VII, a usurper with a tenuous claim to the throne whohad to deal with various rebellions. Henry VIII was almost toppled in 1536. Hissuccessor was the nine-year-old Edward VI, and his Lord Protector, EdwardSeymour, was executed in 1552. Edward VI’s successor, Lady Jane Grey, wasremoved after nine days and beheaded by her successor, Mary I. Her successor,Elizabeth I, was nearly overthrown in 1588 by Philip II of Spain and alsonarrowly survived an assassination attempt. The attempt to kill her successor,James I, in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 is well known.[10][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-10]However, the country does not start to become more stable after this. Charles Iwas executed in 1649, after the Civil War. The Interregnum was violentlyoverthrown in 1660 and the ringleaders hanged, drawn, and quartered. James IIwas removed in 1688, by parliament, and died in exile. But then things begin tochange. Although the last serious rebellion was in 1745, throughout the 18thcentury England develops into a country in which power is held by parliament,not the crown. And the House of Commons is elected by an elite who qualify tovote by virtue of property ownership. The size of the electorate expanded from1832 onwards and, by 1917, all males of 21 or over could vote. In 1928, thefranchise was expanded to include all females aged 21 or over. The country hadbecome more democratic and more politically stable.[11][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-11]"},{"pageContent":"CorruptionAgain, changes in this marker are difficult to precisely measure, but it iswidely accepted by historians that England became much less corrupt, especiallyfrom the end of the 18th century. Indeed, the preceding system is generallyreferred to as the ‘Old Corruption’.[12][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-12] Under this system, England was onlya meritocracy to a very limited degree. Appointments to lucrative positions werealmost entirely a matter of nepotism or people paying to purchase a positionfrom which they hoped to make money. Commissions in the army were purchased, aswere church appointments and secular administrative posts. Many of these weresinecures: positions requiring little or no work but which gave the holderfinancial benefits. Electors voted publicly and were openly bribed and,sometimes, blackmailed. In other words, by modern standards England wasextremely corrupt.This began to change from around the late 18th century onwards, although somehistorians put the beginning of the change at around 1730. In terms of politics,the 1832 Reform Act abolished ‘rotten boroughs’—constituencies with tinyelectorates, which nevertheless had as much influence as big cities in terms ofvoting in parliament. Pocket boroughs were those controlled by a wealthy noblewho would have one of his retainers stand as an MP. He could also control howthe electors would vote, because he was their landlord. This could be donethrough bribery, because voting was by public ballot. The MP would then vote, inparliament, as his patron demanded. The abolition of many rotten boroughs,accordingly, removed many pocket boroughs. Secret ballots were introduced in1867.[13] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-13] Local government was alsohighly corrupt, with the right to vote restricted to those whom the citygovernment felt they could trust. This was ensured by the fact that you had tobe a ‘freeman of the city’ in order to vote and this status would be conferredby the city authorities, often in return for money.[14][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-14] This was changed in 1835, so thatall rate-payers could vote. The ability to purchase a commission in the army wasfinally abolished in 1871 and by this time much of the general corruption hadceased."},{"pageContent":"MurderCriminality is notoriously difficult to compare across time because there are somany variables involved. The definition of particular crimes changes as does theextent to which they are likely to be reported. Social factors which mayincrease crime levels—those that cause poverty—will also fluctuate. As such,caution is required when engaging in such comparisons. Nevertheless,quantitatively-minded historians have done this. They found that, in London, theper capita homicide rate in the year 1278 was roughly 13 murders per 100,000people.[15] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-15] Despite the fact thatthe penalty in England for homicide was hanging all the way up until the 1960s,and despite the fact that there was little significant change in livingstandards between the 1200s and the 18th century,[16][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-16] historians found something which isin line with the theory that we were becoming more intelligent. Based on courtrecords from various cities, we were becoming much less inclined to commitmurder. In 1300, there were 23 murders per 100,000 people in England, similar toBrazil in 2012. By 1500, it was 15 murders, placing England on a par with Mexicoin the year 2014. By 1600, it was 7 murders, and by 1700 just 5 murders. By1800, we were down to 3 murders and by 1900 we were down to less than 2. Byaround 1950, we were down to less than 1 murder. In the UK, the rate is 1 murderper 100,000 as of 2014.[17] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-17] Thedecline in the European murder rate can be seen in Figure 4.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00004.jpeg]Figure 4. Indicators of homicides per 100,000 of the population in Europeancountries, 14th to 20th centuries, fitted to a third-order polynomial curve.[18][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-18]Many historians have been critical of attempting to trace the homicide rate overtime. They question, for example, how likely the crime was to be reported,musing on issues of cultural difference. But, if anything, cultural differenceswould simply downplay the Medieval and Early Modern murder rate because thedefinition of murder was narrower—killing somebody in a duel, for example, wasnot ‘murder’ in Medieval England[19][part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-19]—and, as the society was more corruptand the state’s power more limited, we can easily see how this would lead tounder-reporting. Also, many other studies have shown the same phenomenon. InKent, indictment for murder fell ten-fold between 1560 and 1985. Studies inScandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy reveal the same‘civilising’ process.[20] [part0007_split_008.html#footnote-71617-20] Thesimplest explanation for this civilising process—especially when there was verylittle change in living standards—is that the average intelligence of Europeansociety was increasing every generation. The decline in homicides aggregatedfrom data from England, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries,Germany, Switzerland, and Italy can be seen in Figure 4.It would seem that the simplest interpretation of these data, taken together, isthat society was becoming gradually more intelligent. This is exactly what wouldbe predicted by the reproductive patterns highlighted in the last chapterwhereby those who are likely to have been more intelligent on average—thewealthier half of the population—are enjoying significantly higher fertilitythan the poorer half."},{"pageContent":"Genetic Changes:Comparing the Bronze Age to the PresentUltimately, the frequencies of genetic variants that predict educationalattainment and g should have increased throughout historical time, if g reallydid increase. This is precisely what was found in a 2017 paper in which thefrequencies of three different polygenic scores (which the researchers termedPOLYCOG)—these being composites of several different genetic variants whichcollectively predict a portion of the variance in the phenotype of interest—wereestimated using a sample of (mostly) Bronze Age Eurasian genomes (from 4.56 to1.21 thousand years before present). These were then compared with anancestrally matched European sample of genomes from the 1000 Genomes dataset. Itwas found that the contemporary sample had significantly higher levels ofPOLYCOG (using all three polygenic scores). Furthermore, by simply correlatingthe POLYCOG levels with sample age for a subset of the ancient genomes, astatistically significant positive correlation was found, indicating an increasein these genetic variants over 3.35 thousand years. This can be seen in Figure5. When we talk about a correlation being ‘statistically significant’ this meansthat, based on the sample size and strength of the correlation, there is atleast a 95% probability that the correlation is not down to chance and it is,therefore, a genuine relationship. In science, 95% certainty is set as the linethat must be crossed for something to be accepted as having a high probabilityof being valid.Genetic data are not the only ‘solid’ data indicating that g was rising (upuntil the 19th century). There are also indications that scientific andmathematical geniuses—individuals of great eminence—were increasing in frequencyin Western societies until the 19th century. However, to properly understand thefactors that go into making genius, it is necessary to get a handle on thenature of personality.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00005.jpeg]Figure 5.

So, to really understand the nature of genius, weneed to take a short detour in order to understand what personality is, whatdifferent kinds of personality there are, and the huge influence yourpersonality has on everything from your health to what subjects you’re good atin school.If we return to the computer analogy, intelligence loosely corresponds to theprocessing efficiency of the computer, while personality reflects the types ofsoftware installed on it.[1] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-1] Afurther difference is that, as we have seen, intelligence is measured by IQtests. Personality is more subjectively evaluated. It is either self-rated usingscales upon which you position yourself, or rated by other people (peer-rated).A person high in intelligence, or high on a personality trait such asConscientiousness, is ‘high’ in relation to other people and, as withintelligence, personality changes with age.[2][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-2]"},{"pageContent":"The Big FiveDifferences in personality predict differences in how people will respond indifferent situations. How near to you does a car moving at high speed have to bebefore you decide that it is too risky to cross the road in front of it? Howmany irritating things have to happen to you in a day before you lose it andstart yelling? How strongly does how others feel influence how you feel?Different people will answer these questions differently and they’ll do sobecause they have different kinds of personalities. On a personality test,people are asked whether a certain behaviour, or like or dislike, is present orabsent in them; or else asked to rate its strength on a scale. For example, theNewcastle Personality Assessor includes the following statements about yourself:‘Starting a conversation with a stranger’, ‘Insulting people’, and ‘Feelingstressed or worried’. With each statement you have to rate the extent to whichthey apply to you on a scale ranging between ‘Very unlike me’ and ‘Very likeme’.[3] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-3] These kinds of questions canbe analysed and averaged to yield a few personality ‘traits’ which clustertogether.While many models of the structure of personality have been proposed over thedecades, the model with the greatest currency in modern personality psychologyholds that personality can best be understood in terms of five essentialpersonality characteristics: these are the ‘Big Five’,[4][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-4] with each corresponding to adimension between positive and negative extremes separated by a dash:(1) Extraversion–Introversion. Extraversion is feeling positive feelingsstrongly. It is associated with being outgoing and gregarious (i.e. enjoying thecompany of others). Introversion is experiencing these feelings weakly, and isassociated with being self-reliant.(2) Emotional Stability–Neuroticism. Neuroticism is feeling negative emotionsstrongly. A person high in Neuroticism is emotionally unstable and prone tomood-swings, anxiety, and depression.(3) Conscientiousness–Impulsiveness. Conscientiousness refers to impulsecontrol. People who are high in this are self-disciplined, hard-working, andrule abiding.(4) Agreeableness–Disagreeableness. Agreeableness refers to those who are highin empathy and who are pro-social. They deeply care about, and empathise with,how others feel.(5) Openness-Intellect–Closedness-Instrumentalism. Openness-Intellect is a broaddomain of personality, which references intellectual curiosity and a preferencefor novelty, progressive politics, creativity, aesthetics, and unusualpsychological experiences. The opposite pole of this domain is characterised bylack of interest in novelty, a preference for conservative politics, andpragmatism. Openness-Intellect weakly, but significantly, correlates withintelligence, at 0.3. This is because it—or the ‘Intellect’ domain anyway—ismeasuring some of the same things.These five personality traits are (except for Openness-Intellect) regarded asindependent of IQ scores and our placing on them predicts how we behave. Forexample, high Conscientiousness as a child predicts greater success in theeducation system and in the world of work. High Neuroticism is associated withmood swings, anxiety, and depression. Indeed, it is correlated with sufferingfrom depression at 0.8.[5] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-5] HighExtraversion predicts early death because extraverts are more likely to takerisks, because they will enjoy the resulting pay-off so much more. One studyfound that high Extraversion leads to a three-fold increase in the risk of earlydeath.[6] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-6] Extraversion also predictspoor health, because of the extra enjoyment that will be found in food orsmoking. Unsurprisingly, high Agreeableness predicts having lots of friendswhile low Agreeableness is associated with marital breakdown and criminality.[7][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-7]"},{"pageContent":"The General Factor of PersonalityThe Big Five were developed from the Big Three traits defined by psychologistHans Eysenck (1916–1997). Eysenck arrived in England from Germany in the 1930sand made his temporary visit permanent after the Nazis, whom he loathed, came topower. Eysenck became the dominant personality in British academicpsychology.[8] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-8] The Big Three areExtraversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism. In effect, the Big Five dimensionsof Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are the opposites of various aspects ofEysenck’s Psychoticism; and Openness-Intellect takes some aspects ofPsychoticism and blends them with behaviours characteristic of modernintellectuals or artistic types.Like Eysenck, British-born Canadian psychologist J. Philippe Rushton (1943–2012)was a highly original thinker; to the extent that he was prepared to tacklecontroversial ideas. When he was a PhD student in London, Rushton attempted toprotect Eysenck from a student mob protesting what they perceived to be‘controversial’ aspects of his work, and got punched for his troubles. Rushtonshowed that the Big Five (and Big Three) are all co-correlated, and could alltherefore be reduced to a single personality variable, which he called theGeneral Factor of Personality (GFP). The GFP can be understood as the singlefoundational dimension of personality, corresponding broadly to socialeffectiveness—or the ability to effectively read people and social situationsand to behaviourally regulate oneself. This underlies the more specificpersonality traits—akin to how general intelligence or g underlies all thespecific cognitive abilities, as we have already explored. With personality, youhave the ‘aspects’ or ‘facets’—lots of very specific traits such as ‘courage’ or‘jealousy’. These can be reduced down to the Big Five and these, in turn, yielda Big Two comprised of a broad Stability factor (encompassing Conscientiousness,Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability) and a Plasticity factor (comprisingExtraversion and Openness-Intellect). The Big Two always correlate. This givesrise to the g factor of personality; the ‘General Factor of Personality’.[9][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-9]So the General Factor of Personality (GFP) can be conceptualised as the degreeto which a personality is socially desirable and socially effective. GFPdescribes a basic personality dimension, high levels of which (it is suggested)evolved as an adaptation in complex and stable societies so that people would‘get along together’. So a person with high GFP would be socially extraverted,be empathic and concerned with the feelings of others, conscientious andself-disciplined in pursuit of socially-approved goals, have stable emotions,and be open to new ideas. The existence of the GFP is also why people say thingslike ‘She has a nice personality’, or ‘He’s shallow!’: the idea being thatpeople intuitively understand that there is one ‘core’ personality trait withsocially desirable and undesirable poles—and that paying attention to this inchoosing mates and allies likely would have had significant evolutionarypay-offs. Unsurprisingly, the GFP predicts likeability and employability, and issubstantially correlated with (and is essentially the same thing as) EmotionalIntelligence.[10] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-10] This is theability to ‘know’ yourself and take command over your emotions, which, as wasdiscussed earlier, is sometimes touted as a sort of ‘second’ intelligence, butis really a mixture of general intelligence and the GFP, with such traitsproperly belonging in the ‘personality realm’."},{"pageContent":"How Personality Develops and Why there are DifferencesPersonality develops throughout the lifespan.[11][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-11] Anyone who has ever had afour-year-old child will notice that, in comparison to a child of ten, thefour-year-old will have lower impulse control and is more likely to have atantrum, is less considerate to his or her friends, and is far more likely tobecome scared of something or inconsolably upset. We equally see that theelderly tend towards being non-aggressive and highly resistant to change; ‘setin their ways’. In the 18th-century satire Gulliver’s Travels, Gulliver travelsto the land of Luggnagg where he meets a people called the Struldbruggs. Theyare immortal but lack the gift of eternal youth. In consequence, the veryelderly do not even speak the same language as the young. The language has beenevolving, but they are too set in their ways to keep up with this. This fitswith what we know about the development of personality over the lifespan.We don’t know much about how the GFP changes, so let’s stick to the well-studiedBig Five for the time being. Conscientiousness increases with age up untilpuberty, where people regress a bit, and then from early adulthood it continuesincreasing. Exactly the same is true of Agreeableness. In males, Neuroticismsimply decreases with age, while in females it decreases with age untiladolescence, when it increases, before beginning to decline in early adulthood.For this reason, though there is much variation within the sexes, women scorehigher in Neuroticism then men and are more prone to anxiety.It is interesting that the move towards higher Conscientiousness as one getsolder experiences a blip during adolescence. It may be that there is someevolutionary benefit to this, such as young people being less inhibited andtherefore potentially more creative, and so being more likely to attract theattention of a mate or produce some useful innovation for society at large. Suchbehaviour patterns might also make them more likely to break or loosen the bondwith their parents, incentivising them to make their own mark on the world—thefamed psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961) called this processIndividuation.[12] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-12] Once people reachadulthood their personalities, compared to others of their own age, are fairlystable. For example, one study found that the correlation between personalityscores over six years on the same adult sample was 0.85.[13][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-13]There are clear personality differences between males and females. These fitwith stereotypes about women entering caring professions and men being moreaggressive and inclined to fight and compete. By the time they reach adulthood,women are higher in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness than men: they havehigher impulse control and they are kinder. This would make women better carersfor children and men higher in competitive drive and aggression. This should beborne in mind when people bemoan the fact that high-stakes, money-orientedprofessions like finance or even politics are male-dominated, but nursing andschool teaching are female-dominated, as these differences are precisely whatmale–female differences in personality would predict. Women are also higher inNeuroticism than men, as already noted, which would mean a greater proneness tosuffering from stress. They are higher in some Extraversion facets than men,more likely to be outgoing, for example. The differences on Openness-Intellectare at the facet level. Women are higher in ‘Aestheticism’; men are higher in‘Intellect’.[14] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-14] So, you wouldpredict that women would be more interested in the arts and men more interestedin the sciences.[15] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-15]Personality traits, including the GFP, have been shown to be in the region of50% heritable, based mainly on twin studies. As with intelligence, much of thegenetic underpinnings of personality traits relate to genes with individuallysmall, additive effects, however some of the heritability—perhaps even a largerportion than is the case for intelligence—is due to the action of rare geneswith big effects and epistatic gene–gene interactions (i.e. non-additive geneticeffects).[16] [part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-16] Since the heritabilityof personality is less than one, some combination of chance and the environmentdoes affect the kind of personality which you develop, but only within certaingenetic limits. An unstable, dangerous childhood will tend to increase mentalinstability, and those who experience it will learn to see the world as aperilous place—and this may have a lasting effect on their behaviour. Forinstance, when childhood is unpredictable and dangerous, children will tend to‘live for the now’, so displaying lower Conscientiousness, and they may besuspicious of other people, leading to lower Agreeableness.[17][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-17]Another example is that girls who have grown up in sexually-unstable situationsseem to adopt a short-term sexual strategy. They have children with a largevariety of men and these men are chosen because they are macho, not for theirability to remain committed to the relationship and/or provide resources overthe long term. To put it in slang terms, girls from unstable homes seem toexhibit a preference for ‘cads’ rather than ‘dads’.[18][part0008_split_003.html#footnote-76582-18]So, we have now looked at personality and the important dimensions of life thatits various manifestations predict. This is vital to understanding genius,because of the unusual personality–intelligence profile involved. So, with thisin mind, let us now turn to the crucial issue of the rise in levels of genius asevidence of rising intelligence up until the Industrial Revolution.1 [part0008_split_000.html#footnote-76582-1-backlink] Dutton, E. & Charlton, B.(2015) The Genius Famine, Buckingham: University of Buckingham Press, p. 7.2 [part0008_split_000.html#footnote-76582-2-backlink] See: Soto, C., John, O.,Gosling, S. & Potter, J.

This character appears to be based, to some extent, on thearchetypal genius. His friends, though sometimes slightly socially awkward, arethe typical ‘normal’ scientists. They are highly intelligent, high inConscientiousness, and high in Agreeableness, these traits characterising thetypical scientist.[1] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-1] For thesereasons, they have active social lives—based around ‘nerdy’ interests such asStar Trek—and their lives are highly routinised. Sheldon Cooper deviates fromthis, though perhaps not quite enough to make him the archetype of a genius. Heis super-intelligent, with outlier high IQ; far more intelligent than hisfriends. He is relatively low in aspects of Agreeableness. He is cold, blunt,unreasonable, socially blind, and cares little for the feelings of others evenwhen he can identify them. His intelligence is also very narrow. Simple tasks,such as driving a car, are beyond him, such that his friend Leonard has to drivehim to and from work. He is also extremely unworldly. In earlier‘seasons’—before the series turned into a replacement for Friends—he had nointerest in women, sex, or even money, allowing his pay cheques to pile up in adrawer because, ‘Most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been inventedyet.’Sheldon is, in certain respects, similar to the genius. How do we define agenius? Normally, a ‘genius’—at least in the world of science—is somebody whomakes an enormous breakthrough, which has huge ramifications, such as theinsight of ‘natural selection’ by Darwin or the identification of the laws ofoptics and of gravity by Newton. In much the same way, a hugely importantinvention, such as the Spinning Jenny, can be considered the product of genius.This being the case, we can start to identify geniuses—people who are commonlyrecognised, by other scientists for example, as being geniuses. One method ofdiscerning this is convergent bibliography, which features heavily in theresearch of the American psychologist Dean K. Simonton. Using this method, anindividual’s eminence is really a function of how they are regarded by theirpeers, which can be modelled by simply measuring the prominence and prevalenceof famous names across historical works—thus establishing the degree to whichdifferent authorities agree with one another (or converge) with respect to whois extremely eminent. Simonton terms this field Historiometrics.[2][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-2]Some people argue that this method is subjective because it is based on theratings of mere people and may be coloured by prejudice, meaning that certainpotential geniuses are ignored. It can be countered that genius is a form ofbehaviour, just as tool use among chimpanzees is a form of behaviour. We knowthat tool use among chimpanzees is real only because multiple raters haveobserved this. Similarly, we know that a person behaves as a genius (by having ahuge impact on everything around them) because multiple raters have observedthis. In addition to convergent bibliography, we can assess the biographicalinformation we have about them and draw reasonable inferences about the kind ofpeople they were. A number of important researchers, such as Dean K. Simontonand also Hans Eysenck, have done precisely this, although (as with manyimportant ideas) this approach had its origins in the mind of Sir FrancisGalton.[3] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-3] The generally acceptedconclusion is that if you met a genius you may well superficially dismiss themas ‘mad’. They probably wouldn’t be particularly likeable or friendly, theywould have unusual habits and perhaps dress or speak in an unusual way; theywould be obsessive. They may have many of the signs of what is termed Asperger’ssyndrome; a mild form of autism which is associated with difficulty inunderstanding the feelings of other people."},{"pageContent":"The Nature of Genius: Meeting Sir Isaac NewtonReturning to our discussion of personality, Edward Dutton and Dutch psychologistDimitri Van der Linden have explored the way that, whereas the averagescientist—who might build on the insight made by the genius—would combine highintelligence with high Agreeableness and high Conscientiousness,[4][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-4] the genius would have a much morecomplicated psychological profile. Experts on genius such as Simonton andEysenck concur that high-intelligence is a necessary component for geniuses, butnowhere near a sufficient one; genius being an emergent property of rarecombinations of environment, personality, and ability. The genius is extremelyhigh in intelligence, but is moderately low in Conscientiousness andAgreeableness, which, when coupled with high creativity, is associated with thepersonality trait Psychoticism. This is crucial to genius because geniusinvolves coming up with and presenting a ground-breaking and highly originalidea. Frequently, it involves solving a very difficult problem and working tosolve this—to the exclusion of most other things—for years on end. Trueoriginality will always offend vested interests. It will, at first at least, atbest be met with ridicule and at worst with open hostility. True originalitywill also involve breaking the rules; thinking the unthinkable, contemplatingsomething that is so ‘out there’ that it would seem ludicrous to ordinarypeople.This is why geniuses require the personality profile that they have. As they arerelatively low in Conscientiousness, they are happy to disregard the rules andthey have the ability to think outside of them. Combined with extremely highintelligence, this means that they have the ability to think in a highlyoriginal way and, so, to solve incredibly difficult problems. Their moderatelylow Agreeableness will have two consequences. Firstly, it will help them todedicate themselves to their work, as they find dealing with other peopleextremely difficult and tiresome. Low Agreeableness is associated with highself-esteem, so they are likely to bounce back quite well from anydiscouragements which they experience while trying to solve their chosenproblem. Once they’ve solved it, they will have no difficulty in telling thewider world about it. This is because, moderately low in Agreeableness, theywon’t care about the offence they may cause and would have trouble anticipatingthat their work would cause offence even if they did care.A final dimension to the genius personality, which may seem quite surprising, isat least elements of Extraversion.[5] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-5]Geniuses are risk-takers and they are highly competitive. Often, when a problemhas needed a solution, many people have been working to solve it. The recognisedgenius is the one who wins the race to solve the problem, so there is a degreeto which he must have a strong competitive drive. The best example of this canbe seen in the way that Darwin went to print with his theory of evolution (or ashe termed it modification by descent) in 1859 because he was under the erroneousbelief that Alfred Russell Wallace had, independently, come up with preciselythe same theory. Darwin, however, had developed his own theory around 20 yearsearlier. Indeed, it should be remembered that though the archetypal geniuscombines super-high intelligence with moderately high psychoticism, there willbe all kinds of variations on this theme. For example, a given genius—Darwin maybe an example—might be quite high in Agreeableness, but extremely low inConscientiousness (according to his son Francis, Charles Darwin’s working habitswere extraordinarily unsystematic and his study was always in a state ofchaos).[6] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-6] As long as the overallbalance between the psychological factors is optimum, a genius can still beproduced.To understand what the genius is really like, we should perhaps meet just one ofthem. Sir Isaac Newton’s intelligence was undoubtedly enormous, so what would hehave been like to know? In their book, The Genius Famine: Why We Need Geniuses,Why They’re Dying Out and Why We Must Rescue Them, Edward Dutton and BruceCharlton discuss precisely this issue. They note that as a child and young manNewton would spend nearly all of his time alone and when in company he would besilent. He had essentially no friends, formed no relationships with women, andmade very little effort to conform at all. As a boy, his relationships withother boys tended to be antagonistic. He really wasn’t a very nice person.Newton was taught Latin at school and not much else. In terms of mathematics andscience, he simply taught himself. Whatever he did, he did because he wanted todo it, he became engrossed in it and he did it brilliantly. In a year or so, hewent from knowing almost no mathematics to mastering the subject and being amongthe best in the world; and then he immediately went on to make some of thegreatest ever mathematical discoveries. Newton’s own explanation for hisachievement was that he solved problems ‘By thinking on it continually’. He alsoremarked, ‘I keep the subject constantly before me.’ Then he all-but droppedmathematics, and instead worked on one area of physics after another—makingmajor discoveries, then moving on. Newton would think solidly for hour uponhour—sometimes standing lost in his own world half way down the stairs. For manyyears he hardly ever left his college. He almost never left Cambridge.[7][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-7]But there is another aspect of Newton that was particularly interesting;something he has in common with Einstein and many other geniuses. While Newton’sacademic performance was good, it was not amazing. Indeed, it was rathererratic. He excelled at some things and was mediocre at others. For example, heperformed badly in his BA examination, which was a viva voce disputation;needing to go on to a second round of questions (rather than passing straightaway).[8] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-8] This is true of many othergeniuses, observe Dutton and Charlton. Francis Crick, who co-discovered DNA, wasrejected from Cambridge and went to university in London, where he failed to geta top degree.[9] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-9] He then proceeded todrop out of a variety of PhD courses.[10][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-10]Newton’s methods were highly intuitive. This can be contrasted with the methodtypical of highly intelligent and conscientious un-creative people—who readwidely, learn many facts, and then try to apply other people’s solutions toproblems. And this leads us to a further point. It has been shown that as peoplebecome more intelligent —as IQ goes up—the relationship between the differentcognitive abilities becomes weaker. This is termed Spearman’s Law of DiminishingReturns, after Charles Spearman (whom we encountered previously), who firstdescribed this effect in 1927.[11] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-11]In other words, as people become more intelligent, they become more specialisedin the nature of their intelligence. So, a person who is of roughly averageintelligence will be ‘okay’ in terms of their linguistic, spatial, andmathematical scores but they will be relatively equally okay in each one. Bycontrast, somebody who has much higher intelligence may be better on all ofthese measures, but they won’t be equally better. They are likely, for example,to have much higher mathematical scores, with their linguistic scores being onlymoderately higher. But the mathematical scores are so much higher that, overall,the physics student, or whatever he may be, will have a much higher averageIQ.[12] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-12] Spearman’s Law ofDiminishing Returns does not refute the concept of g—this being present in theability scores of even those with the highest levels of intelligence. The gfactor is, however, somewhat weaker among such individuals—as specialisedabilities become more autonomous, playing a bigger role in influencing cognitiveperformance.Geniuses, who have extraordinarily high IQs, will therefore tend to have an evenweaker relationship between their different cognitive abilities. What thismeans, in practice, is that though they are super-intelligent overall, they mayactually be below average when it comes to certain tasks that are towards thebase of the ‘intelligence pyramid’ and, so, only weakly correlate with g. This,along with their moderately high psychoticism, would help to explain their oftenless than outstanding academic performance at university and, indeed, their‘nutty professor’ behaviour patterns. Einstein once got lost close to his homein Princeton, New Jersey. He walked into a shop and said, ‘Hi, I’m Einstein, canyou take me home please?’ He couldn’t drive a car, and many other tasks thatmost people take for granted were simply too difficult for him.[13][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-13] This is, probably, the best exampleof somebody of extraordinary intelligence being, really, quite stupid, albeit ina specialised sort of way. Sheldon Cooper, of course, relies on Leonard tochauffer him to and from work."},{"pageContent":"The Evolution of GeniusSo, how has ‘genius’ been selected for? There is no evidence that geniuses havelots of children. Indeed, quite the opposite seems to be true. They arefrequently asexual and often don’t reproduce at all.[14][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-14] Why, then, do they exist? Shouldn’tthey be shunned by the prehistoric tribe—as dangerously uncooperative—andremoved from the gene pool?This brings us back to the issue of group selection, which you will recall fromearlier. There are different means by which you can pass on your genes. Firstly,there is doing so directly. If you have a child it will carry 50% of your genesand so it makes sense, genetically, for you to look after this child and help itto pass on its own genes. However, there are indirect ways of passing on yourgenes as well. This ‘indirect breeding’ model was pioneered by the Englishbiologist William Hamilton (1936–2000).[15][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-15] Hamilton was born in Egypt to NewZealander parents, his father being an engineer and his mother a doctor. Whenevacuated to Edinburgh during World War II, he became fascinated by naturalhistory and at university, at Cambridge, became so obsessed with reading aboutnatural selection that he neglected his degree studies. His ideas had a hugeinfluence on evolutionary psychology. Always a pioneer, he travelled to theCongo in an attempt to understand the origins of HIV and died soon after hisreturn, possibly because of an ulcer caused by the anti-Malaria medicine takenon his expedition.[16] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-16]Hamilton articulated the idea of ‘inclusive fitness’—that you can pass on yourgenes through means other than having direct descendants. You can follow aprocess of ‘kin selection’ where you invest in nephews and nieces (25% of yourgenes), cousins (12.5% of your genes), and so on. This is why many a spinsterauntie will be inclined to spoil rotten her sibling’s children. She is aidingher kin and so indirectly perpetuating her own genes. For this reason, in somecircumstances, it would make sense, in terms of inclusive fitness, to lay downyour life if a large number of your cousins were under mortal threat, especiallyif you had already had children yourself. According to Hamilton, people will actaltruistically if the benefit to their inclusive fitness is greater than thefitness cost of the act. Thus, it would make sense for a menopausal mother tolay down her life to save her only child. This would not make so much sense ifthe mother, aged 21, was told to make a choice between her child’s life and herown, because she could go on to have many more children.The idea of kin selection can be logically extended to group selection. It hasbeen established that ethnic groups are genetic clusters. The average Englishmanis highly genetically similar to the next average Englishman relative to theaverage Dane, based on genetic assay data. The Australian political psychologistFrank Salter has calculated that if the world were divided between only Englishand Danes, then two average English people would have a kinship coefficient of0.0021, whereas it would be zero for an Englishman and a Dane. This coefficientwould be the equivalent of sharing a set of 6 x great grandparents; that isbeing 7th cousins. So, from a genetic perspective, it would be adaptive for anEnglishman to fight to protect his ethnic group from Danes, even if it riskedhim having no children at all. If his actions saved enough of his people, thiswould more than compensate for the lack of direct breeding.[17][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-17] The soldier, who laid down his lifein this way, would be operating at the level of group selection. Indeed,computer models have shown that the more ethnocentric group—the group whosemembers are more inclined to repel outsiders and make sacrifices for the good ofthe group—always eventually dominates in between-group competition, all elsebeing equal.[18] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-18] Thus, thesuccessful group will produce more people—though not too many —who are preparedto shun individual and even kin selection in favour of a group selectionstrategy.Building on an idea first proposed by William Hamilton,[19][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-19] it has been proposed that geniusescan be understood to operate precisely this kind of strategy.[20][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-20]. Their inventions do not benefitthemselves or even their families (Gregory Clark has documented many cases ofgeniuses being cheated out of the credit for their inventions—which neverthelesswent on to change the world) but they benefit the group to which the geniusbelongs. The inventions which kicked off the Industrial Revolution, for example,allowed the British population to soar in size and wealth and to expand aroundmuch of the globe. Clearly, then, a successful society needs to maintain anoptimum but relatively low number of geniuses. The number cannot be too many,because a society full of uncooperative, impractical dreamers will be dominatedby a more internally cooperative and practical one. And it cannot be too few, orthe society will be dominated by one which has the appropriate number ofgeniuses to allow the necessary level of innovation.Geniuses will be formed—to the extent that genius is genetic—by chance butpossible combinations of genes, which will stay in the population (and are oftenconcentrated in certain family lines) precisely because they occasionallyproduce genius and this is outweighed by the negative which those genes inslightly different combinations can produce. This negative is people of lowintelligence and high psychoticism—in other words, those who may be criminallyprone. Recall that although the bulk of the genetics of intelligence involvegenes with additive, or small and incremental, effects, there is also a roleplayed by rarer genes with large effects and also epistasis, or gene–geneinteractions, not just among genes responsible for intelligence, but involvingpersonality and other traits as well. It is these rare genetic factors that playthe biggest role in the genetics of extreme talent and genius.[21][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-21] It has been noted that both geniusesand criminals are antisocial risk-takers, though geniuses are moreintelligent.[22] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-22]For geniuses to happen, the available gene pool cannot be too small —otherwisegeniuses will be too unlikely to be produced (the odds of getting precisely theright interactions among genes are very small). Thus, the genius is likely to beborn to parents who are within the normal range of intelligence and have normalpersonalities and this genius is likely to have siblings who are much more likehis or her parents. However, the genius will be very different. As discussed,the genius will be an outlier not just in terms of intelligence, but also interms of creativity and personality."},{"pageContent":"The Growth of GeniusThe genius, then, is one of the most significant people society has to offer atany given time, as they combine super-high intelligence with the optimum levelof moderately high psychoticism which, within the context of a particularsociety, allows scientific and technological breakthroughs to be made. We canimagine that the inventor of the wheel, or the boat—people whose names are lostto history—would have been this kind of person, in comparison to the rest oftheir society. As the intelligence of the society increases, so the scarcity ofgenius would decrease, and as the society becomes more complex—coming intoconflict with other groups—so the need for genius would increase. We havealready traced the rise—via a series of proxies—of the intelligence of Europeansocieties up until the 18th century. This rise should be paralleled by anon-going increase in more and more significant technological breakthroughs associety’s geniuses become more and more prevalent. As we have already seen,scientific and technological achievement is associated with intelligence at theindividual level.A number of researchers have shown that rates of innovation do indeed climb aswe reach the 18th century. Jonathan Huebner, an American physicist, published apaper in 2005 in the journal Technological Forecasting and Social Change inwhich he showed precisely this.[23] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-23]He drew upon a list of 8,583 important events in the history of science andtechnology, agreed to be highly significant by scientists, from the Stone Age upuntil 2004. Huebner limited this to the most recent 7,198 events, those since1450. He noted down the year in which each event happened. Huebner then workedout what the world population was in each year, meaning he could track the percapita level of innovation. He found that scientific innovation rates per capitaincreased four-fold between 1450 and 1870. This can be seen in Figure 6 below.The American political scientist Charles Murray, in his 2003 book HumanAccomplishment, showed that it was not only significant innovations that wereincreasing between the Middle Ages and the mid-19th century, but(unsurprisingly) the eminent individuals responsible for them (i.e. geniuses)were increasing too.[24] [part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-24] There werehumps and bumps, of course. Innovation was reduced during periods of war andfamine for example. But we can see there is a dramatic rise and then, as ofabout 1873, a fall.Michael A. Woodley of Menie developed Huebner’s model.[25][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-25] Huebner drew upon a particularinventory compiled by two scientists so, to avoid subjective bias, Woodley ofMenie tested to see how well it correlated with other, similar, inventories. Forexample, he compared it to an index of significant scientific breakthroughsbetween 1400 and 1950 compiled by Murray.[26][part0009_split_003.html#footnote-79262-26] In each case, the correlation wasover 0.8, showing that the inventory was not merely subjective. Woodley of Menieused a number of sources to calculate the average intelligence of the populationin each year charted by Huebner. He showed that the simplest explanation forHuebner’s findings was that intelligence was increasing between 1455 and about1850 and then decreasing after that. This is what best fitted all these data.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00006.jpeg]Figure 6.

We would like tothank Jonathan Huebner for giving us his data for secondary analysis."},{"pageContent":"SevenHow Did Selection for Intelligence Go Into Reverse?So, intelligence was increasing up until the dawn of the Industrial Revolutiondue to selection. This meant there was a process of ‘Survival of the Richest’and, by extension, selection, each generation, for the most intelligent. Thisprocess was coupled with group selection and colonial expansion, fuelled by thefruits of genius, which culminated in the Industrial Revolution; an explosion oftechnological innovation the like of which the world had never seen before andhas never seen since.It is, perhaps, difficult for us to get our heads around the pace of the changeduring the Industrial Revolution because it would have been so dramatic. Someoneborn in 1770 would have grown up in a world little different from 1470.Transport would be via horse and almost everything had to be done by hand.Production was already beginning to mechanise, because James Hargreaves hadinvented the Spinning Jenny in 1764.[1][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-1] An early steam engine had alreadybeen forged, but it hadn’t yet caught on. However, if that person had liveduntil just 1804, they would have seen the invention of the electric telegraph,the steam ship, the submarine, the circular saw, the steam roller, a reliableclock, the bicycle, the battery, and the steam-powered locomotive. The world of1804 would have been dramatically different from that of 1770 or 1470.If this person had lived until 1870, until the age of 100, they would have seenthe electric light (1809), the steam train and the first photograph (1827), theelectro-magnet, the typewriter (1829), the sewing machine, the electric dynamo,the calculator, the propeller, the revolver, the telegraph, rubber tyres, thewashing machine, and, in 1858, the internal combustion engine. Then there wasplastic and dynamite and we reach the year 1870. The extent and speed of changeover a lifetime like that, compared to those for hundreds of years before, wouldhave been astonishing.And this new technology assisted numerous scientific breakthroughs, especiallyin the realm of public health and medicine. In the pre-industrial world, therewas a very limited understanding of the causes of illness and, therefore,illness selected against the least healthy. But this began to change. In 1796,Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine, for example.[2][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-2] There were also many otherimprovements in public health, such as better sanitation. And the simplestexplanation for why all this was able to happen was that, for so long, we hadbeen selected for intelligence by the rigours of natural, sexual, and socialselection."},{"pageContent":"Scientists Who Predicted Intelligence Would DeclineHowever, by the 1860s, some people were beginning to notice something alarming,alarming for them anyway, and it had happened, in part, as a direct consequenceof these breakthroughs in public health.[3][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-3] The first person to write about itwas a French physician, and early psychiatrist, called Benedict Morel(1809–1863). In 1857, Morel published a book in which he pointed out that theinfant and child mortality rates in France were clearly in decline.[4][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-4] They were in decline, he argued,because various improvements in public health in the preceding 50 years meantthat many infants who would have died were now surviving into adulthood. It maysound callous, but there was a clear logic to the argument which followed. Thisincreased survival rate, and consequent reproduction, would necessarily meanthat the population would have a higher percentage of members who lackedwhatever partly hereditary qualities were necessary for survival before theseimprovements in public health took place. Morel regarded the most importantqualities as ‘health’, ‘moral character’ (by which he meant, essentially, highConscientiousness and high Agreeableness), and ‘intelligence’. He was of theview that these qualities were transmitted within families, from parents tochildren, through a combination of (what would later be called) genetic andenvironmental processes. He argued that there was what he called a ‘degenerateclass’, an ‘underclass’ of prostitutes, criminals, and the desperately poor, andthat these people—albeit in his subjective experience as a physician andpsychiatrist—seemed to have particularly high fertility. So, Morel predictedthat these two processes—the reduction in child mortality as a check on thefertility of the ‘underclass’ and the, apparent, greater fertility of theunderclass—would necessarily lead to the population of France gradually becomingless intelligent. In addition, they would also become—he predicted—moregenetically sick.Very similar conclusions were reached, around a decade later, by an Englishgentleman scientist. Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911), whom we encounteredpreviously, was very much the Renaissance man. Statistician, polymath, socialscientist, proto-geneticist, inventor, meteorologist, geographer, and eventropical explorer, the diversity and extent of his achievements were trulyextraordinary for the time. Galton read Darwin’s Origin of the Species in 1859.He noted in 1865 that:‘One of the effects of civilization is to diminish the rigour of the applicationof the law of Natural Selection. It preserves weakly lives that would haveperished in barbarous lands. The sickly children of a wealthy family have abetter chance of living and rearing offspring than the stalwart children of apoor one.’[5] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-5]Galton’s language is brutal, but, in light of the strongly heritable characterof intelligence, it is difficult to fault his reasoning: ‘the weak members ofcivilized societies propagate their kind’, he argued, leading, inevitably, to‘degeneration’. It is noticeable, of course, that Galton doesn’t necessarily seethe problem as a matter of ‘the lower orders breeding too much’. The weakeningof selection is particularly problematic precisely because wealthy people withaccess to modern medicine will be able to save a sickly child whereas poorpeople will see their healthier children die due to their terrible livingconditions. This problem would have been less pronounced before the rise ofscientific medicine. In general, only the strong would have survived. Galtonsummarised that: ‘there is a steady check in an old civilisation upon thefertility of the abler classes: the improvident and unambitious are those whochiefly keep up the breed. So the race gradually deteriorates, becoming in eachsuccessive generation less fit for a high civilisation.’[6][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-6]Charles Darwin (1809–1882) discussed the reversal of selection with respect to‘socially valued’ traits in his second major book, The Descent of Man. Inessence, Darwin argued that as societies become more advanced they become morecompassionate towards their weaker members. This makes sense because, as we havealready seen, the ability to solve social problems is modestly correlated withintelligence. Furthermore intelligence makes you more able to put yourself inthe position of others. In other words, it increases your ability to empathise;it makes you nicer. Darwin, of course, is so highly respected that some peoplewill try to bolster their arguments by appealing to him, while their criticswill accuse them of misinterpreting him or quoting him out of context. So, letus simply quote what Darwin wrote, in 1871, verbatim:‘With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those thatsurvive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on theother hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylumsfor the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and ourmedical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the lastmoment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, whofrom a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus theweak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who hasattended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highlyinjurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or carewrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting inthe case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worstanimals to breed.’[7] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-7]In conversation with Alfred Russell Wallace (1823–1913), shortly before Darwin’sdeath, Darwin expressed extreme pessimism about the future of humanity, tellingWallace, ‘It is notorious that our population is more largely renewed in eachgeneration from the lower than from the middle and upper classes.’ Darwin alsospoke of the large number of children of what he called ‘the scum’ and theinevitable deterioration, as a consequence, of the qualities that were needed tobuild up civilisation.[8] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-8]Karl Pearson (1857–1936) was a leading mathematician and the protégé andbiographer of Sir Francis Galton. Pearson was among the first to demonstratethat intelligence was heritable. He also believed selection for higherintelligence had pretty much completely reversed in modern populations due tothe increased survival and high fertility of those with low intelligence. In his1901 book, National Life, he wrote that, ‘while modern social conditions areremoving the crude physical checks which the unrestrained struggle for existenceplaces on the over-fertility of the unfit, they may at the same time be leadingto a lessened relative fertility in those physically and mentally fitter stocks,from which the bulk of our leaders in all fields of activity have hitherto beendrawn.’[9] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-9] He also wrote, in 1912,that ‘the less fit were the more fertile’ and consequently, ‘the process ofdeterioration is in progress.’[10] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-10]Sir Ronald Fisher (1890–1962) was a geneticist and a statistician. He was bornin Finchley, now in outer London, the son of an auctioneer. Fisher looked at theissue of the reversal of selection on intelligence and other traits in his 1929book, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection.[11][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-11] In this, he summarised a number ofthe early investigations showing a negative association between socioeconomicstatus and fertility. For instance, Heron, in 1906, had shown that among Londonboroughs the birth rate was inversely associated with an index of averagesocioeconomic status.[12] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-12] Fisherbelieved that social mobility over many centuries had led to genes for highintelligence being concentrated in the ‘professional classes’. Accordingly,their relatively low fertility would surely lead to the decline of intelligencelevels. Indeed, Fisher’s ‘law’ was that civilisations collapse due to a negativerelationship between intelligence and fertility,[13][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-13] something we will explore in laterchapters.Raymond B. Cattell (1905–1998) was born in West Bromwich, near Birmingham, wherehis father made car components. Cattell worked on the question of decliningintelligence in the 1930s. He presented his results in 1937 in his book, TheFight for Our National Intelligence.[14][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-14] Cattell collected data which showedthat there were social class differences in average intelligence. There was agradient, with higher professionals having the highest average IQs and unskilledworkers having the lowest. Cattell made an estimate of the decline ofintelligence, using a sample of 3,700 ten-year-old children and examining thenumber of siblings they had. Cattell found that, on average, the moreintelligent children had fewer siblings. This meant that intelligence had to bedecreasing. He calculated that IQ was likely to be decreasing, based on this, byabout 3 points per generation. Cattell, accordingly, predicted a decline ineducational attainment, in ‘moral standards’, in cultural, scientific, andeconomic life, and in law-abiding behaviour.[15][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-15]In 1951, Cattell carried out another study on a comparable sample often-year-olds to see whether their average intelligence had declined. Thesurprising result, which came to be known as Cattell’s Paradox, was that theaverage IQ had increased by 1.3 IQ points.[16][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-16] Cattell argued that the explanationwas that various environmental factors, especially improvements in education,had probably masked a real decline in IQ.[17][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-17] Cattell’s finding in fact representsone of the first observations of what came to be known as the Flynn Effect,which will be explored in more detail later."},{"pageContent":"What is the Association between Intelligence and Fertility Now?These researchers either subjectively observed a negative association betweenfertility and intelligence or found it to be the case some time ago, based oncorrelation studies using proxies for intelligence. However, there is now a verylarge body of evidence indicating that fertility is negatively and directlyassociated with IQ in industrial societies. There are many documented examplesof this and the process is, therefore, likely to be happening in all suchsocieties. Put simply, the more intelligent people are, the fewer children—onaverage—they tend to have.USAThis can be seen in the USA. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY)refers to a series of surveys carried out by the US Department of Labour. In1979, a representative sample of 12,686 people aged between 14 and 22 weresurveyed. The progress of their lives was followed every year until 1994 andevery two years thereafter. This sample was also given an IQ test. GerhardMeisenberg, a German biochemist working at Ross University School of Medicine onthe Caribbean island of Dominica, looked at the correlations in this survey,between IQ and the number of children people had in 2004, when they were betweenthe ages of 39 and 47, and so, in the case of women in particular, towards theend of their reproductive lives.[18] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-18]The results can be seen in Table 5.Table 5. IQ and fertility of the NLSY 1979 (Meisenberg, 2010).SampleCorrelation between IQ and Number of Children (all correlations, except for theBlack males, are significant)White Males–0.089White Females–0.162Black Males–0.049Black Females–0.271It can be seen that there is a weak but statistically significant negativeassociation between intelligence and IQ and it is much stronger among women thanamong men. Another research group, led by psychologist Charles Reeve in 2013,drew upon a sample of 325,252 people aged 29. They found a correlation of –0.18between numbers of children and IQ and a correlation of –0.26 between numbers ofchildren and education level. Based on this, they estimated that IQ in the USAis declining by 1 point per generation.[19][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-19] These findings are consistent withthe negative relationship between education level and fertility in the USA whichwas highlighted by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray in their 1994 book TheBell Curve. This can be seen in Table 6.Table 6.

The less intelligent want to havemore children and actually have more children than they plan to have. We willlook at the reasons why later.BritainThis negative association between intelligence and fertility can be seen in manyother countries. In Britain, a study examined the relation between the IQs of asample of 9,614 eleven-year-olds in Scotland and their numbers of children atthe age of 46–51. They reported that, among men, those with children had anaverage IQ of 105.82, while those without children had an average IQ of 107.59.Among women, those with children had an average IQ of 106.55, while thosewithout children had an average IQ of 108.94.[20][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-20] Japanese evolutionary psychologistSatoshi Kanazawa looked at 9,434 British 46-year-olds born in 1958 and foundthat childhood intelligence was significantly negatively associated withparenthood among women. Women who were childless had an IQ of 105.3 while thosewho had children had an IQ of 101.7. However, there was a negligible differenceamong men where those who were childless had an IQ of 103.0 while those who hadchildren had an IQ of 102.2.[21] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-21]In addition, a meta-analysis in 2015 examined the results of 12 studies of therelationship between intelligence and fertility in Britain and the USA between1927 and 2010. It was concluded that the IQ loss in the UK and the USA due tothis pattern had been 0.39 points per decade across the 20th century.[22][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-22]RussiaRussian psychologist Ekaterina Chmykhova and her team have found evidence of thesame process in Russia. They obtained average scores on the Standard ProgressiveMatrices for representative samples in 29 Russian provinces and found acorrelation of –0.57 between the birth rate in the province and its averagescore. In a representative Russian sample aged between 40 and 50, they foundthat number of offspring negatively predicted score on the Standard ProgressiveMatrices IQ test. Based on this, they calculated that the IQ of Russians isfalling by 0.44 points per generation.[23][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-23]Taiwan and ChinaA study of the relationship between intelligence, education, and fertility inTaiwan has been reported by Chen, Chen, Liao & Chen.[24][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-24] They assessed intelligence with theWechsler test on a representative sample of adults aged 35 to 84, and foundthat, for women, the correlation between fertility and IQ was –0.35 and thecorrelation between fertility and education was –0.59. For men, the correlationbetween fertility and IQ was –0.18 and the correlation between fertility andeducation was–0.37. This was replicated more recently, with Taiwanese data again showing anegative correlation between intelligence and fertility.[25][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-25] Research on China by psychologistMingrui Wang and his team has found evidence of the relationship there as well.Drawing upon the China Family Panel Studies dataset, they found that for thebirth cohort born between 1951 and 1970 the correlation between fertility andfluid intelligence—the ability to solve novel problems without any previousknowledge, such as in the case of matrix reasoning tests of IQ—was–0.10. Based on this, they estimated that Chinese IQ is likely to have fallen0.75 points between 1986 and 2000. They also found a growing negativerelationship between years in education and fertility in China. In 1945 it was–0.17 whereas by 1990 it was –0.42.[26][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-26]KuwaitThe same relationship has been reported in Kuwait. Psychologists examined arepresentative sample of 4,643 children in Kuwait aged between 8 and 15 years.They found a correlation of –0.05 between family size and average score on theStandard Progressive Matrices IQ test. This is essentially a negligiblemagnitude, albeit significant, effect size.[27][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-27] Another study found that there is asignificant negative correlation in Kuwait—based on a sample of 7,749—betweenfertility and a number of robust proxies for intelligence. These proxies wereeducation level, occupational status, age at first marriage, and socioeconomicstatus.[28] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-28]Sudan and LibyaOmar Khaleefa, a Sudanese psychologist who has been missing since 2012,[29][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-29] reported that in 2008 the StandardProgressive Matrices was administered to 5,215 students aged 9 to 20 fromsocially representative schools in Khartoum. The results showed a significantnegative association between Standard Progressive Matrices score and the numberof siblings a student had. Khaleefa calculated based on this that Sudanese IQ isdeclining at a rate of 0.8 points per generation.[30][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-30] Similarly, in Libya anadministration of the Standard Progressive Matrices to school children found acorrelation of –0.14 between IQ and number of siblings.[31][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-31]"},{"pageContent":"Why Do Smarter People Have Fewer Children?Here we reach the crucial question. Why is intelligence negatively associatedwith fertility in industrialised societies? In particular, why is this so whenit wasn’t the case in pre-industrial societies? And why is the negativeassociation stronger when it comes to women?This takes us to a further question: why would people have lots of children,which they certainly did until relatively recently? One reason is that people,for example in pre-industrial England, understood that a significant percentageof their children—on average about half—would die before they reached adulthood.So, to the extent that they followed an instinct of wanting to pass on theirgenes, they needed to have as many children as they could afford, in order toguarantee that some would survive to have children themselves. In addition, in asociety with no welfare state, children would be an insurance policy in old age.They would take care of you once you were too elderly to work, assuming youlived long enough to become too elderly to work. Most people, therefore, hadlots of children. But the children of the poor suffered massive infantmortality, and poverty forced the poor to try to control how many children theyproduced. If they had too many, then they could all starve, unless theyabandoned unwanted infants. Infant mortality was much lower among the rich andthey could afford to have more children anyway, so it was the genes of the richthat survived.The Industrial Revolution changed the situation radically and heralded what isknown as the ‘demographic transition’. This is when a society moves from beingone characterised by high fertility and high child mortality to being onecharacterised by low fertility and low child mortality. This transition, whichwas complete in Western countries by the beginning of the 20th century, comes intwo stages. In the first stage there is a massive decline in child mortality andthis is followed, some years later, by a steep drop in fertility. In theintervening period, the population will dramatically increase because there willbe both high fertility and low child mortality, presumably because people havenot yet quite grasped that it is safe to heavily limit their fertility and soallow their living standards to improve. By the middle of the 20th century, mostfamilies in Western countries had only two children and, by the end of it, theywere down to less than two, to below replacement fertility.The reasons for this transition are fairly clear. The scientific breakthroughsof the Industrial Revolution led to inoculations against childhood diseases,better sanitation, cheaper food, better public health in general, and thecountry being far wealthier, leading to the beginnings of a welfare state forthe very poor. By 1900, the infant mortality rate in England wasn’t 45%, but amere 10%.[32] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-32] Almost every childsurvived into adulthood and the relationship between poverty and child mortalitywould have been very weak. Serbian cultural anthropologist Jelena Čvorović andher team found, among a sample of Serbian Roma, that the relationship betweenchild mortality and IQ was –0.26, when controlling for factors such as povertyand health.[33] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-33] As such, thepopulation grew dramatically.Education LevelAs we have discussed, years spent in education is a good proxy forintelligence—the two measures sharing about 60% of their genetic variance incommon.[34] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-34] Educational attainmentis not a phenotype in the same way as IQ, however. Instead it can be thought ofas an environment which sorts individuals based on their level of innateability, and also personality related factors such as Conscientiousness andpersonal drive. The additional role played by personality in predictingeducational outcomes is the principal reason why educational attainment and IQare not 100% genetically correlated. A side effect of this sorting is that itmay encourage individuals to trade fertility for the opportunity to acquiregreater degrees of education—with the more intelligent being more likely to makethis trade-off. Years spent in schooling have increased dramatically in the 20thcentury (on average people increase their exposure to education by 24 monthsevery three or so decades[35] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-35]), ashave the pressures on individuals to delay or even abandon reproduction.Studies from many countries have found that the more educated people are, themore likely they are to end up childless. Gerhard Meisenberg, whom we metearlier, examined the relationship between education level and fertility basedon data from the World Values Survey cohorts from 1990, 1995, and the year 2000.This gave him a sample of 181,728 people from 78 different countries indifferent parts of the world.[36] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-36]Meisenberg found that in nearly all countries there was a significant negativecorrelation between education level and completed fertility; that is fertilityin late middle age when you are most unlikely to have any more children. InLatin American and Middle Eastern countries the correlation was –0.31 forfemales and –0.24 for males, while in Protestant Europe it was much weaker,though still significant: –0.1 for females and –0.01 for males. The exceptionswere old males, aged 45 to 75, in Belgium, Finland, Latvia, Sweden, Switzerland,and Uganda and young men in Estonia. Here there was a weak positive relationshipbetween education level and fertility.Interestingly, Meisenberg found that the negative relationship was stronger for‘education level’ than for ‘years spent in education’, implying that the moreeducated do not just delay having children in order to become educated.Something which motivates becoming highly educated also motivates low fertility.Meisenberg also found that the relationship is not ‘mediated’ (caused) bypersonal wealth. So, a desire to be wealthy does not seem to motivate people tolimit their fertility. Wealth, alone, does not make people less inclined to havechildren.Another fascinating finding is that the strength of this clearly universalnegative relationship varies in a very clear way. It is weak in very poorlydeveloped countries, probably because they are still undergoing the demographictransition. It is strongest in the societies that are involved in making thetransition, but it is weak, once again, in the most advanced societies, such asthose in Protestant Europe. However, this relationship may be getting strongeramong younger people in these societies.Studies have also been conducted into the relationship between polygenicscores—collections of alleles that predict variation in a given measure, in thisinstance educational attainment—and completed fertility, revealing negativeassociations between the two. A study by economist Jean Beauchamp found that thenegative association in the US Health and Retirement Study was strong enough toreduce educational attainment by 1.5 months per generation, which translatesinto an IQ loss of around 0.32 points per decade.[37][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-37] A study in 2016 revealed, usinggenetic data from the US Add Health cohort, that IQ mediates (causes) thepositive association between these polygenic scores and educational attainment,and that educational attainment in turn mediates the negative relationshipbetween IQ and fertility.[38] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-38]In other words, simply having the genes that make you smart does not necessarilymake you less fertile.[39] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-39] Instead,the negative association is driven to a substantial degree by the fact thatsmart people choose to trade time spent in education against fertility.Education is therefore one key factor that creates selection against the genesresponsible for cognitive ability, which indicates that intelligence willdecline over time.ContraceptionRichard Lynn and others have presented the rise of contraception as a key reasonfor the change.[40] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-40] The developmentof the condom meant you could enjoy as much sex as you wanted with a muchreduced risk of pregnancy. Lynn notes that the condom was first taken up by the19th-century elite. The main means by which information about contraception grewin the 19th century was through the publication of a number of books. This, ofcourse, limited contraception to those who were educated and could read andafford books.The development of reliable contraception had predictable results, notes Lynn.It meant that in the context of low child mortality (relative to the 18thcentury), the more intelligent had far fewer children than the less intelligent.The more intelligent, trusting that most of their children would survive,calculated that they could improve their children’s chances by having fewer ofthem. They would have more money to invest in each child and their legacy tothem would be less thinly spread. The more intelligent, who would have been moreeducated and members of the so-called ‘reading classes’, found out aboutcontraception first and started using it first, near the beginning of the 19thcentury. Accordingly, by the end of the 19th century there was a huge differencein fertility between the more educated and the less educated, with the latterhardly using contraception at all. This difference narrowed by the beginning ofthe 20th century but was still clear and significant.And this is very likely due to intelligence. Once contraceptives were widelyavailable, the only reason you end up with a large family, unless you activelywanted one, would be if you were an inefficient user of contraception or youweren’t forward thinking enough to use contraception at all. Both of thesereasons would be underpinned by low intelligence. More intelligent people wouldbe more efficient users of contraception. An example of how this would work canbe seen in the contraceptive pill. A more intelligent woman will thoroughly readthe instructions, understand that the pill has to be taken at the same timeevery day, and carefully do so, comprehending that unwanted pregnancy may be theresult if she doesn’t precisely follow the instructions. A less intelligentwoman might not read the instructions properly, will not really understand howthe pill works, and will take it when she remembers to, perhaps knocking it backwith a glass of wine in the evening. An even less intelligent woman, who istherefore highly impulsive, will simply have unprotected sex in themoment—because it’s enjoyable, now—without thinking about the long-termconsequences at all.This interpretation is backed up by the fact that, as we have already seen,unwanted pregnancies are associated with low intelligence. There is a negativeassociation between intelligence and the number of planned children you have.For the United States, researchers have analysed the National Survey of FamilyGrowth sample of women having babies in 1988 and found that 36% of them wereunplanned. The incidence of unplanned births is strongly related to educationallevel. Among women with less than twelve years of education, 58% of births wereunplanned, falling to 46% among those with twelve years of education, 39% amongthose with some college education, and 27% among college graduates.[41][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-41] In the United States, it has beenreported in a 1988 study that 72% of 15- to 19-year-old women from middle classfamilies used contraception on the occasion of their first sexual intercourse ascompared with 58% of those from poor families.[42][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-42]In addition, intelligence is negatively associated with the age at which youfirst have a child, whether you are male or female. More intelligent peopledelay parenthood because they want to concentrate on their careers, giving themmore resources to invest in their small family, and because they are less likelyto become parents accidentally. Less intelligent people will begin theirfamilies younger. This compounds the consequent loss of intelligence because itmeans that the less intelligent not only have more children than the moreintelligent but they have more generations. In extreme cases, they may begrandparents in their late-thirties, at the same age that more intelligentpeople become first-time parents.Desire for ChildrenA third reason for the negative association between intelligence and fertilityis that the less intelligent simply want to have more children. One theory isthat intelligence correlates with the personality factor of Intellect and,therefore, the more intelligent will be less interested in having children andmore interested in focusing on their work or generally leading an intellectuallystimulating life—which may play a key role in encouraging those with higherintelligence to spend time in education. Large families will subtract from theability to achieve this.Intelligence certainly predicts a desire to ‘remain childless for life’. Amongmen the average IQ of 23-year-olds who want to have children is 100 while the IQof those who don’t is 104. With women, the IQ of those who never want to havechildren is 105. The IQ of women who wanted children was 99.94.[43][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-43] And this is borne out by looking atBritish people who are still childless at the age of 32, based on a sample of13,687 infants born in 1946 and interviewed in 1979. The more intelligent theyare, the more likely they are to not have any children. This can be seen inTable 8.Table 8. Percentages of British males and females childless at age 32 by IQgroups (Lynn, 2011, p. 92).Low IQAverage IQHigh IQFemales111618Males242428The Welfare StateWe have already seen that unplanned pregnancy—and, by extension, pregnancy bysingle mothers, which is generally unplanned—is associated with lowerintelligence. Richard Lynn has argued that the welfare state itself also aidsthe process of reducing the average intelligence of the population. Until thesecond half of the 20th century there were very strong incentives for singlewomen not to have illegitimate children. Unmarried mothers suffered loss ofemployment, loss of earnings, and severe social stigma. They were not givenwelfare payments or housing for themselves and their babies. Indeed, theconsequences of becoming pregnant, as a single woman, were so severe and thelevel of social stigma so strong that the resultant children were often put upfor adoption.This began to change in the second half of the 20th century as the governmentsof Western nations began to provide, or to increase substantially, welfarepayments and housing for single women with children. This was possible, ofcourse, because of the increased wealth, which can ultimately be traced back tothe Industrial Revolution. The effect of the welfare state was to providefinancial incentives for women with low intelligence to have babies, or at leastto reduce the disincentives. Increasing numbers of them began to do so. The casethat increasing welfare payments for single mothers had the effect of increasingthe illegitimacy rate was first worked out for the United States by CharlesMurray in his book Losing Ground. Murray showed that from the early 1960s thewelfare benefits paid to poorly educated young women increased relative to thewages for unskilled work. There was also a reduction in the social stigmaincurred by having babies out of wedlock. The combined impact of these factorswas to increase the incentives and reduce the disincentives for single mothersto have illegitimate children. Among White American women, illegitimate birthsremained steady at 2% from 1920 to 1960, and then rose steadily to 22% in 1991.Half of welfare single mothers are in the bottom 20% of the population foreducational attainment.[44] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-44]Herrnstein and Murray in an analysis of another data set, in The Bell Curve,found that the average IQ of long-term welfare-dependent single women is 92.[45][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-45]The same thing has occurred in Britain. From the 1970s onward single mothers inBritain have received a basic income, free housing, remission of property tax,and a variety of other benefits. Illegitimacy in Britain, which had stood ataround 5% of births over the 400 years from 1550 to 1950, began to increasesteadily from the 1970s and reached 32% in 1991. It currently stands at around50%.[46] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-46] Murray’s analysis of the1991 British census shows a correlation of 0.85 between the male unemploymentrate and the female illegitimacy rate across local authorities, and thatillegitimacy increased most over the years 1974 to 1991 among the lowest socialclass.[47] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-47] The welfare state meansthat people can afford to be more relaxed in terms of their sexual activity,confident that, whatever happens, they will be okay.Though we have focused on single mothers, the welfare state would also act as adisincentive for poor families to limit their fertility. Prior to theintroduction of the welfare state, it was possible to fall into the mostterrible poverty and end up in the dreaded ‘workhouse’. This would have acted asan incentive for those who couldn’t afford more children to do their best not tohave any more and be extremely careful in terms of their sexual activity. Withthe introduction of a far more generous system of poor relief in the second halfof the 20th century these same people could afford to be less mindful of therisks of unplanned pregnancy.In 2016, Adam Perkins, a neurobiologist at Kings College, London, published abook entitled The Welfare Trait: How State Benefits Affect Personality.[48][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-48] The results presented in the bookled to a predictable furore. A senior editor at the leading science journalNature refused to consider it for review because she regarded research into thepersonalities of the long-term unemployed as unethical.[49][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-49] This may be because much of theresearch it presented directly challenged the view that long-term welfareclaimants are simply victims of ‘systemic’ inequality. Focusing on long-termbenefit claimants, Perkins cited research from the UK showing that every 3% risein benefits leads to welfare claimants having approximately 1% morechildren.[50] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-50] Indeed, Perkins notesthat follow-up interviews found that benefits were a causal factor becauseclaimants chose to discontinue contraception use in response to rises inbenefits. This clearly implies that a generous welfare system encourages thoseof relatively low intelligence to increase their fertility. He notes largecohort studies, which demonstrate that increasing welfare generosity hasresulted in increasing fertility among recipients in the UK. Perkins draws uponthe National Childhood Development Study (NCDS) (sample 7,219) which began in1958 when the participants were born and last interviewed them when they were55. He also draws upon the British Cohort Study (BCS) (sample 7,046) which beganwhen the participants were babies in 1970 and last interviewed them when theywere 42.The studies found that the association between low self-control in childhood andhaving large numbers of children had doubled over a period of 12 years. Perkinsimplies that this is due to greater welfare benefits. But, certainly, he citesevidence from the UK in 2013 which shows that workless households have thehighest number of children per household, mixed households are in the middle,and households where both parents are working have the lowest average number ofchildren per household. So-called ‘troubled’ or ‘problem’ households have evenmore children than workless households.[51][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-51] Only the problem, workless, orpartly workless households are reproducing at above replacement level.[52][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-52] So, by implication, intelligencewill decline, in part, due to the welfare state.Fascinatingly, Perkins draws upon information from the UK’s Office for NationalStatistics for 2015, which found a slight reduction in the number of live birthsthe previous year. He suggests that this would likely reflect government benefitcuts, which were introduced in 2013. The statistics also showed that foreignwomen living in the UK—which has relatively generous levels of unemploymentbenefit—were 0.34% more fertile than their compatriots at home, when stratifiedby the prosperity of their country of origin. So, unemployed women from poorcountries were, perhaps unconsciously, adjusting their fertility upwards to takeadvantage of the greater available resources. Perkins, in discussing the systemin the UK, notes that the benefit cap of 2013 means that the limit is stilldouble a full-time minimum wage job and this limit can be reached by having lotsof children. He further notes qualitative evidence that welfare recipientfamilies require far less money than they are given but, rather than puttingmoney aside for their children, they seem to spend the money on unnecessaryluxuries such as alcohol, cigarettes, and electronic equipment instead.[53][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-53] Perkins also presents evidenceshowing that children raised on welfare are far more likely to be neglected thanthose who are not. They are even spoken to less by their parents.Perkins concentrates on personality and argues that the welfare state is, ineffect, causing those with an ‘employment resistant personality’—low inAgreeableness and low in Conscientiousness—to be more fertile than those with awork-oriented personality, and he notes the heritability of personality.However, much of the research he cites would seem to imply that it is also thosewith low intelligence whom the welfare state is effectively encouraging to havechildren. For example, an analysis of low income families in the northernEnglish industrial town of Sheffield in the 1970s showed that the 33 familiesregarded as ‘problem families’—those requiring assistance from social servicesand other government agencies—were more impulsive, apathetic, paranoid, andaggressive.[54] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-54] Thesecharacteristics are associated with low Agreeableness and low Conscientiousnessas Perkins rightly argues. However, they are also associated with lowintelligence.[55] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-55] Perkins emphasisesthat personality can be just as important as intelligence for succeeding inemployment, but he does not show that it is more important. He providesdiscussions of highly intelligent people who only go so far in the world of workdue to low Agreeableness and low Conscientiousness. But he might have equallyprovided examples of highly Conscientious and Agreeable people who are nevergoing to be promoted beyond a certain level by virtue of simply not being cleverenough.Perkins also cites the so-called Dunedin Study, a New Zealand longitudinal studywhich began in 1972. It began by presenting children aged 4 and 5 with amarshmallow and telling them that they could get the marshmallow now or wait 15minutes and receive a second marshmallow in addition. This is a standard ‘delayof gratification’ test and, as we have seen, it correlates with intelligence.The children who were able to delay gratification, unsurprisingly, were rated bytheir parents as ‘more academically and socially competent, verbally fluent,rational, attentive, planful, and able to deal well with frustration andstress’.[56] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-56] Again, these traits areassociated with intelligence. Those who were found to be lower in this abilityto delay gratification were more likely to find themselves unemployed or havelow socioeconomic status as adults. Clearly, Perkins’ research, or that which hecites, demonstrates that a personality comprised of low Agreeableness and lowConscientiousness is associated with elevated levels of unemployment and thewelfare state may be assisting these kinds of people to have children. But muchof it also implies that intelligence is highly relevant and this is congruouswith the earlier research from the USA, which we have already discussed.Indeed, there is evidence that would indicate that the impact of the welfarestate on the fertility of those with low Agreeableness and low Conscientiousnessmay be more complicated than Perkins thinks. As Perkins argues,Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are part of a constellation ofinter-correlating characteristics known as a ‘slow life history’—or K—strategy;in essence, living for the future rather than living ‘fast’ and for ‘the now’.It has been shown that in Sweden (a strong welfare state) and the USA (a weakerwelfare state), slow life history strategy actually positively correlates withfertility.[57] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-57] The researchers arguethat the reason for this is that living ‘for the now’ involves having as manykids as you can as quickly as you can because you perceive the environment to beunstable; so you could be killed without warning. However, you invest little inthe children and are, in essence, simply predisposed to seek out lots of sexwith lots of partners. Modern contraception means you can avoid the resultantlarge number of children.In earlier times, you could be a ‘drive-by parent’—effectively having thesechildren whilst investing very little energy or resources in them. The largenumbers produced coupled with the higher genetic diversity among childrenresulting from larger numbers of partners hedges the offspring againstenvironmental instability. In other words, they are genetically diverse, so itis more likely at least some will survive. But, now, you do not want thesechildren because modern society will compel you to invest resources in them, onpain of punishment. It has developed agencies to track fathers down and extractmoney from them, for example.By contrast, the ‘slow’ strategists want to invest their energy in raisingchildren, even if they don’t want many of them. Accordingly, in this kind ofenvironment, the only way that a faster strategist would end up with lots ofchildren would be by accident; if he or she was so lacking in intelligence thathe or she couldn’t work out how to use contraception, for example. Intelligenceand life history (K) are only extremely weakly correlated with one another—beinglargely distinct domains of cognition and behaviour respectively.[58][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-58] It is true, however, that for sometraits, such as executive functioning and time preferences, in addition tocertain personality traits, g and K make joint but distinct contributions toindividual differences. Therefore, fertility patterns that apparently favourhigher K yet also lower intelligence simultaneously, in the same populations,are not contradictory if they are acting on separate traits controlled bylargely distinct sets of genes.It could be argued that the welfare state discourages such a person from makingthe effort to use contraception, because it means that they don’t have to investmuch of their limited resources in the resultant children. The welfare statewill provide for them. Indeed, if we were rather cynically minded we could takethis argument further, as Richard Lynn has. People of relatively lowintelligence, such that they are unable to hold down all but low-paying jobs,are likely to be intelligent enough to rationally calculate that they are betteroff not working as long as they have lots of children. They can then fritteraway the ‘child support’, to which these children entitle them, on their ownpleasures, investing as little of it in the children as they can.So, they are intelligent enough to deliberately have a large number of(neglected) children, in order to play the system, meaning that the welfarestate encourages their fertility and contributes to declining intelligence.However, they are not intelligent enough to realise—or have the foresight tocare about the fact—that their behaviour may lead to the collapse of the verysystem they rely upon if too widely adopted, and means that the system ispotentially unsustainable in the long term. This is because low intelligencepredicts low levels of foresight, empathy, altruism, and civic-mindedness.FeminismAnother important contributory factor to the negative association betweenintelligence and fertility in industrial societies has been the rise of feminismand, in particular, the opening up of the professions to women, a point alsoraised by Richard Lynn. In the first half of the 19th century, routinediscrimination meant that very few jobs were open to women at all. Women mightbe maid-servants, cooks, laundresses, cleaners, seamstresses, or factory workersof certain kinds. However, jobs such as teaching or nursing, which wererelatively skilled, had to be abandoned if the woman got married. Obviously,professions such as medicine and law weren’t open to women. This began to changein the second half of the 19th century and accelerated after World War I, duringwhich many women did the assorted jobs that men couldn’t do because they wereaway fighting. The percentage of women who worked increased dramatically notjust in terms of women working in factories and the like but also in terms ofwomen in the professions, such as teaching, medicine, and law.This has led to a situation where most women now work, even if many give up workfor significant periods when they become mothers. The more intelligent womenwill go to university and then enter one of the professions. By doing so, theywill delay motherhood, often into at least their late twenties and, sometimes,significantly beyond that. They spend most of their twenties and maybe even thefirst half of their thirties concentrating on their careers. The result is thatfor purely biological reasons they can expect to have a relatively small numberof children, as fertility declines with age and does so very rapidly from around35 onwards.[59] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-59] And, indeed, theymay find that they have left it too late and they cannot have children at all.By contrast, we can expect that less intelligent women will be less likely todelay their fertility. Herrnstein and Murray have shown that in the USA, on theNLSY, the percentage married before the age of 30 decreases as IQ increases.Among those with an IQ classed as ‘dull’, 81% who had got married had done sobefore the age of 30 and the average age at marriage was 21.3. Among thoseclassed as ‘very bright’, only 67% had married before the age of 30 and theaverage age at marriage was 25.4.[60][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-60] For these reasons, the entry ofwomen into the professions can be seen as a contributory factor to the negativerelationship between intelligence and fertility. More intelligent women will bemore able to go to university, more willing to go to university, and moreinterested in their careers. So, when they have the options of becoming aprofessional—and so delaying or completely abandoning motherhood—they are morelikely and more able to take it. Indeed, this may explain why, among youngercohorts, the negative relationship between intelligence and fertility isactually becoming stronger in some countries. It weakened as knowledge ofcontraception spread down the social hierarchy but has strengthened once more asmeritocracy, which enforces equality of the sexes to a great extent, allows moreintelligent women to become highly educated and enter the professions. Inaddition, with the rise of the pill and the coil, contraception has becomeextremely reliable, meaning that unwanted and excess pregnancies are likely tobe associated, even more strongly than before, with low intelligence. And thishas coincided with the same society providing very generous welfare payments tosingle mothers.ImmigrationThe final factor that is reducing average intelligence in developed countries isby far the most controversial. That factor is immigration from less developedcountries. It would usually be a factor that we wouldn’t mention or, at least,we would be extremely careful to whom we mentioned it for fear of peoplebecoming ‘offended’ or even physically violent towards us.[61][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-61] One problem with science, which manypeople find difficult to get their heads around, is that the aim of science isto understand the nature of the world and to present the simplest explanation,based on the evidence, for what is going on. Science is not there to bereassuring, to make people feel good, or to help bond society together. Thereare some researchers who have argued that there should be a ‘moral’ dimension toscience and that, therefore, some findings—that upset people or make their livesdifficult—should be suppressed or such uniquely high levels of proof should bedemanded before they can be disseminated that they should effectively besuppressed. This is a problematic argument because, until that stage is reached,we could be developing policy based on a false hypothesis and this may in turnlead to seriously damaging consequences for society. Those who call forsuppression are, in effect, arguing that scientific pursuit is fine until itforces them to question the worldview that they hold to for emotional reasons.Once it does this it is ‘bad science’ or ‘a higher standard of proof should bedemanded’ or ‘it is immoral’. Or it is ‘racist’ or ‘sexist’. Or it is one ofnumerous other vague, indefinite, emotive terms that are deployed to associatethe research with deviance and thus intimidate researchers into ideologicalconformity.But it would be unforgivably intellectually dishonest of us to censor thisissue, particularly considering the substantial body of academic research on it.Moreover, we have detailed research into the kind of people who buy books likethis. They are inquiring and highly intelligent and so we are confident thatnone of our readers will be intellectually unable to deal with scientificresearch, which might question how they have previously thought. So, let’s getdown to it. We have seen that intelligence is distributed on a bell curve. Thenature of that curve varies according to the group that we’re discussing. Forexample, you will find plenty of highly intelligent people who have never beento university and plenty of not especially intelligent people who have. However,if you were to plot the intelligence of these two groups on a bell curve youwould find it was slightly different. The percentage of graduates with an IQabove 130 would be greater than the percentage of non-graduates with this IQ andabove. The percentage of non-graduates with an IQ of below 100 would be greaterthan the percentage of graduates with this IQ and below. And the range of thegraduate IQ would be narrower; less like a bell, in other words. This does notmean, we must stress, that non-graduates are stupid and graduates are clever.Anyone that has ever attended a British university will testify to the presenceof some extraordinarily silly people. It simply means that a random graduatewill probably be more intelligent than a random non-graduate, at least whencontrolling for age. Any non-graduate reading this who is highly intelligentshould in no way be offended by this. And nor should any intelligent graduatefeel a sense of pride. Feelings are irrelevant to this. We’re talking aboutfacts.In much the same way, there are average differences in intelligence betweendifferent ethnic groups in Western countries.[62][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-62] Northeast Asian (what in the olddays would have been called Oriental) immigrants are the most intelligent. Theyare more intelligent than Europeans and they have an average IQ of 105.Europeans have an average IQ of 100. Immigrants from South Asia and the MiddleEast have an average IQ of about 90. Immigrants from Africa and the Caribbeanhave an average IQ of about 85. It cannot realistically be argued that IQ testsare unfair towards immigrant children. Northeast Asians perform better on themthan Europeans, immigrant children perform the best on the least g-loaded partsof the IQ test even when the tests are stripped of parts that could beconsidered to be culturally-biased (such as the vocabulary scale, which willunfairly penalise those for whom English is not their primary language).[63][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-63] And these differences in IQcorrelate in the right direction with group differences in reaction times, whichare an entirely objective measure.[64][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-64]So, let us turn to what is happening, using the example of Denmark. EmilKirkegaard is a Danish researcher who began his career by doing a degree inlinguistics. Indeed, his bachelor’s thesis looks at the exciting issue of Danishspelling reform. However, tiring of the academic quiet life, Kirkegaard hasturned to the academic hot potato of group differences in IQ. Based oninformation from Statistics Denmark, he has shown two important things. Firstly,non-Western immigration in Denmark has risen substantially between 1980 and2012, on an almost continuous upward trajectory. In 1980, 50,000 non-Westernimmigrants were living in Denmark. In 2012, 300,000 non-Western immigrants wereliving in Denmark. Secondly, drawing upon published Danish army conscript datahe showed that if we set the average IQ of Danes at 100 then the average IQ ofnon-Western immigrants is roughly 86. He cites studies showing that in manydifferent Western countries a comparable difference exists between the nativepopulation and immigrants, at least when putting aside immigrants from NortheastAsia. Kirkegaard argues that this difference is substantially genetic in originbecause, in England for example, it has been shown to develop by a very youngage among second-generation non-Western immigrants and it also fits with studiesthat show average differences in IQ between countries.[65][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-65] These, themselves, stronglycorrelate with national differences on the PISA scholastic test, which isadministered every four years to representative samples of 15-year-olds fromOECD countries.[66] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-66]However, one issue at which Kirkegaard does not look is differential fertilitybetween Danes and non-Western immigrants in Denmark. As of 2012, non-Westernimmigrants in Denmark produce an average of 1.8 children per couple, whereasthis is 1.69 for ethnic Danes. However, second generation immigrants are definedas ethnic Danes for statistical purposes, meaning that the Danish number islikely to be significantly lower and the non-Western immigrant numbersignificantly higher.[67] [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-67] Clearly,therefore, immigration from non-Western countries into Western countries is apotential contributory factor to IQ decline in Western countries. This declinewould have happened even if there were no immigration, however. Immigration issimply speeding the process up.This fertility and intelligence differential is likely to be the same in allWestern countries. Richard Lynn has presented evidence for this from the year2000, which can be seen in Table 9 below.Table 9. Fertility rate of Europeans and non-Europeans in 2000 (Lynn, 2011, p.272).CountryEuropeansNon-EuropeansFrance1.92.8Netherlands1.72.5Sweden1.52.3It can be seen that the fertility rate of non-European mothers is almost doublethat of European mothers. Though the Danish statistics indicate that, while thisdifference is decreasing, the difference nevertheless still exists. Lynnpresents data showing that this same process is occurring in Australia, NewZealand, Canada, the USA, and in other European countries; in other words,across the Western world. Based on these data, he calculates the Europeanpercentage of different Western countries by certain years. By 2050, the UK,which was about 86% European in 2006, will be 56% European. The USA, which was71% European in the year 2000, will be 45% European.[68][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-68]So, all of these developments have led to a ‘perfect storm’ of factors whichensure that there is a negative relationship between intelligence and fertilityand a negative relationship between education level and fertility. We wouldexpect this negative relationship to have been present in England at least sincearound 1800. Based on these data, Lynn has calculated that by the year 2106 theaverage IQ in Britain should be about 87, 13 points lower than it is now. Thiswill obviously have huge implications for living standards, democracy, politicalstability, civic society, crime rates, and all of the other issues that areconnected to IQ. The only Western country where Lynn predicts no significantintelligence decline over the next 20 years is Canada, because its immigrantpopulation is primarily Northeast Asian in origin. Similarly, Danishpsychologist Helmuth Nyborg has calculated that by 2072 Denmark will be 60%Danish and IQ will have gone down by 5 points, partly due to immigration andpartly due to less intelligent Danes having the highest fertility.[69][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-69]Indeed, research by Richard Lynn and the Finnish political scientist TatuVanhanen (1929–2015) has shown that there are average IQ differences betweencountries. These strongly correlate with other measures of cognitive differencesbetween countries, such as differences on international scholastic tests likePISA, so they are likely to be broadly correct even if some samples areproblematic. Lynn and Vanhanen have shown that the average IQ of a countrystrongly predicts how highly it will score on pretty much every measure ofcivilisation that you can think of: educational attainment, average earnings,democracy, lack of corruption, nutrition, life expectancy, low infant mortalityrate, access to clean water and sanitary conditions, low levels of crime,liberal attitudes, rational attitudes, and even happiness.[70][part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-70]However, if intelligence is declining, and if intelligence is stronglyheritable, we would expect it to be clearly measurable. There should be clearevidence that intelligence has been decreasing for the last century or so. Wewill see that there is indeed such evidence. However, the most obvious place tolook for evidence is IQ tests and here things start to become complicated, atleast at first...1 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-81725-1-backlink] Baines, E.

Reactions to their research haveincluded death threats, assault, disruption of lectures, police investigations,trumped up academic misconduct investigations, condemnation in the media,condemnation by politicians leading to threats to their safety, petitions to befired from university posts, and actual firings from university posts. We hopereaders will agree that it is shocking that researchers can be treated in thisway simply for reporting what they genuinely regard as empirically accuratefindings. Such critics also deploy less violent though equally illogicaltactics, such as finding small errors in the works of such scholars andattempting to claim that the whole work is, therefore, suspect; or attacking theresearcher personally rather than his or her arguments. For example, they mightaccuse the researcher of bias, which, of course, has no bearing at all onwhether what they are saying is empirically accurate.62 [part0010_split_003.html#footnote-81725-62-backlink] We have already lookedat the fallacious arguments levelled against the concept of ‘intelligence’.Similar arguments are used against the concept of ‘race’. A ‘race’ is a breedingpopulation that differs, genetically, from other such breeding populations. Itdiffers as a result of geographical isolation, cultural separation, andendogamy. A ‘race’ shows patterns of genotypic frequency for a number ofinter-correlated characteristics compared with other breeding populations. Themost obvious manifestations of these differences are differences in physicalappearance and mental characteristics which correlate together, indicating thatit is useful, following the scientific desire to be able to make correctpredictions about the world, to divide humans into racial categories in much thesame way that we might divide any other particular animal species into differentsub-species. The differences between races may be smaller than the differenceswithin races for certain traits, but if these small differences are all in aparticular direction—due to adaptation to a particular environment—they willlead to significant overall differences. Genetic clustering data indicate thatthere are around five to seven distinct races. Anyone who wants to question the‘morality’ of the ‘race’ category should note that there are significant racedifferences in the prevalence of genetic diseases, so there are potentiallyserious consequences to denying the significance of race.

He began his academic career as a political scientist,his first major paper, in 1964, being on the peace movement in the USA. This wasfollowed by such studies as American Politics: A Radical View in 1967, Humanismand Ideology: An Aristotlean View in 1973, and assorted highly philosophicalworks including the article ‘Kant and the Price of Justification’ in 1979.[1][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-1]In 1980, however, Flynn’s research profile began to change. He became fascinatedby intelligence and IQ. As far as he could see, comparing old IQ testsadministered to representative cohorts to modern ones, IQ scores had actuallybeen increasing over time. He wrote to as many psychologists as he could in anattempt to obtain as much data as he could and the result was a ground-breakingpaper published in 1984 in the journal Psychological Bulletin: ‘The Mean IQ ofAmericans: Massive Gains, 1932 to 1978.’[2][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-2] This study, and subsequent studiesconfirming it, was so influential that Flynn’s discovery became known as the‘Flynn Effect’. In fact, as early as 1937, psychologists were commenting onevidence of rising IQ scores in the USA[3][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-3] and Richard Lynn had alsorediscovered the effect in a 1982 paper in the journal Nature, which has led tosome people terming it the ‘Lynn-Flynn Effect’.[4][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-4] But, irrespective of whoever reallywas the first to uncover it, the effect has now generally become known as the‘Flynn Effect’. The Flynn Effect is the phenomenon whereby average IQ scoreshave increased throughout the 20th century. Later cohorts have, on average,higher scores than earlier cohorts.When IQ tests are taken by each new cohort the average score is set at 100. TheFlynn Effect has meant that with each new cohort the new average score issignificantly above 100, which was, by definition, the average score of theprevious cohort. As such, it is clear that the average IQ score must have beenincreasing over time. Between the 1930s and the 1970s, at least, we appeared tohave been getting more intelligent or, at the very least, better at IQ tests.The extent of these gains in IQ was really quite staggering. IQ scores werefound to be going up by between 3 and 5 IQ points per decade or about a third ofan IQ point per year. If this was really a reflection of intelligence increasingthen the average person today would have to be considered some kind of genius inthe 1930s. Flynn Effects have been reported across Western Europe, as well as inother Western or highly developed countries such as the US, Canada, Australia,New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan.More recently, Flynn Effects have been documented in developing countries aswell. The Kenyan IQ—on the Coloured Progressive Matrices—increased by almost 14points between 1984 and 1998. Between 1977 and 2010, the IQ of the Saudis wentup by 11 points. The same phenomenon has been observed in Sudan, Turkey,Dominica, Brazil, India, Israel, Argentina, white South Africa, and China. Ithas also been observed in ex-Soviet countries, such as Estonia from 1935 to1978. Over the course of the 20th century IQ scores increased in highlydeveloped countries and the same process then occurred in less developedcountries by the end of the 20th century.[5][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-5]"},{"pageContent":"What Is Going On?Superficially, the Flynn Effect makes absolutely no sense. Surely, ifintelligence is strongly heritable and intelligence has been negativelyassociated with fertility for a long time, then IQ scores should be decreasing.How on earth can they be increasing and increasing so dramatically?A closer look at the process allows us to make sense of it. The most importantpoint is that the Flynn Effect has not been found to be occurring equally on allof the different parts of the IQ test. So, a representative Dutch male samplemade gains of 0.6 IQ points per decade between 1952 and 1982. They made thesegains on the Raven’s test. This test measures fluid intelligence; that issolving problems purely via abstract reasoning without any prior knowledge. TheWechsler test is far broader. It measures both fluid intelligence andcrystallised intelligence, where you do have to draw upon prior knowledge. Theonly Wechsler sub-test which showed similar gains to Ravens was the‘similarities’ test. This is the test where you have to classify things. Forexample, you might be given a list of animals and have to select the one that isnot a mammal. So, in fact, IQ scores were not rising in general but only on veryspecific kinds of ability.[6] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-6]This was backed up by a number of studies which found that the Flynn Effect isnot occurring on ‘general intelligence’.[7][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-7] We have already discussed the conceptof general intelligence or g. As we have seen, people who perform well on onekind of IQ test—for example, one that measures mathematical intelligence—also dowell on all the others. As such, we conclude that there is a general factorunderpinning ability in all of these different intelligence tests and we callthis ‘general intelligence’. However, analyses of the Flynn Effect in manycountries show that it is not occurring on the highly g-loaded sub-tests. Infact, the Flynn Effect is occurring most strongly on the least g-loaded parts ofthe test. In other words, the Flynn Effect is not a rise in generalintelligence. This is a point which Jim Flynn has emphasised in his book on theFlynn Effect, Are We Getting Smarter? The Flynn Effect involves a rise in veryspecific abilities that are weakly associated with general intelligence. Theseseem to be specialised abstract reasoning skills that relate to the ability touse classification, in other words thinking in a scientific and analyticalway.[8] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-8]But, if that is the case, how can this possibly lead to massive IQ gains? Theanswer is quite simple. If people became dramatically better at an ability thatis only weakly associated with intelligence then this would be reflected intheir overall IQ score, causing their IQ score to increase. Therefore, if theywere sufficiently strong in this ability (or a small set of abilities) then itcould be more than enough to lead to them achieving a very high IQ score despitethe fact that there had been no increase in their general intelligence. Indeed,their general intelligence might have decreased, but the massive increase inspecific abilities could be enough to not only hide this decrease but show,overall, a huge increase. This would be entirely in line with the fact that theincreases are only on certain specific parts of the IQ test and that these aretypically the least g-loaded parts of the test.[9][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-9]A comparable example can be seen in how well people do in their school leavingexams. In general, these exams—in various different school subjects—can beunderstood as a test of intelligence and, overall, the more intelligent childrenwill do better in them than the less intelligent children. But they are very farfrom a perfect measure of general intelligence. They also measure other factors,including Conscientiousness and simply the degree to which people are preparedfor the exams. If their parents are wealthy and have hired them a private tutor,for example, this is likely to have at least some positive impact on theirresult. They will have practised more, learnt more, thought about the subjectmatter more, been taught techniques and skills to better answer the questions,and so on. This being the case, it is quite possible—if the degree ofConscientiousness or the extent of social advantage is great enough—that a lessintelligent child could do better in their school exams than a more intelligentchild. In much the same way, the imperfect nature of the IQ test means that aless intelligent cohort could perform better on the test than a more intelligentcohort, as long as the test was in part measuring something which the lessintelligent cohort scored so much higher in that it compensated for their lowerintelligence.In fact, we can highlight a very specific limit to the usefulness of both the IQtest and school exams. They are both excellent instruments for measuring generalintelligence differences within a cohort. But they are not good instruments atmeasuring it between cohorts. This is because they do not control for thepossibility that the infrastructure of the society is changing in such a way asto ensure that people practise these tests more and more and think in a way thatis relevant to these tests more and more. Tabloid newspapers often bemoanso-called ‘grade inflation’ in the UK. The percentage of students getting topgrades in their school leaving exams seems to increase every year. But thenevery year students are getting more experienced in taking exams, moreexperienced in thinking in the ways that help them to do well in theseparticular exams, and have greater access to more and more information.Accordingly, it becomes very problematic to assert that a person that got an Ain A-Level Maths in 2015 is better at Maths, let alone cleverer, than a personwho got a C in it in 1960.[10] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-10] So,to measure general intelligence changes over time it is a bad idea to use IQtests. More objective proxies, that are less sensitive to these sorts ofcultural changes, would be better and these are what we will use."},{"pageContent":"Scientific SpectaclesEven if general intelligence is decreasing, there are a variety of ways in whichthe modern world is going to cover this up. Most obviously, better nutrition anda more intellectually stimulating environment—such as in relation to compulsoryeducation and widespread literacy—are likely to mean that pretty much everybodyachieves their maximum genotypically allowable intelligence, in a way that wouldnot have been as easily possible before the Industrial Revolution, when therewas widespread malnutrition and illiteracy. Also, increased living standards arelikely to mean that people are decreasingly stressed and decreasingly sick andthis should also have some positive effect on IQ test scores, via the effect ofthese factors on boosting brain development and promoting specialised abilities.In addition to these factors, Flynn himself has proposed that the modern worldmakes us think in a different way. It causes us to use what Flynn has called‘scientific spectacles’.[11] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-11] Inother words, the Industrial Revolution has created an environment whichencourages us to think in a scientific and analytical fashion. We do this from avery young age and, therefore, become increasingly more adept at it over time.Flynn gives the example of Russian peasants who were interviewed in the 1920s.With no education at all, they were simply unable to think in the kind ofscientific, analytical way that we now take for granted.‘Q: There are no camels in Germany. The city of B is in Germany. Are therecamels there or not?A: I don’t know. I’ve never seen German villages. If B is a large city thereshould be camels there.Q: But what if there aren’t any in Germany at all.A: If B is a village there is probably no room for camels.’The Russian peasant who was interviewed lived in concrete reality, not a worldof symbols. He almost certainly couldn’t read and we probably learn more newinformation in the average day than he might have done in ten years. He simplyfound it impossible to think in an abstract way. He thought in a concreteway.[12] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-12]With the Industrial Revolution, we are forced to think in an abstract way. If welearn to do formal mathematics, we are entering a world of symbols, which compelus to think in an abstract way. The same is true if we learn to read and writeor if we learn a foreign language. The Industrial Revolution increases levels ofeducation. It leads to a more specialised society in which more people must beliterate and numerate, compelling society to make ever more schooling mandatory.It leads to a wealthier and more stable society in which there is more money toeducate people and more reason to invest in the future. And it leads to easyaccess to information through the cheaper production of books and newspapers andthe development of television and computers. To keep up in the industrial world,with its ever-increasing mechanisation, we require some understanding ofscience, which also compels us to think in a more abstract way. We mustunderstand how things work and why they work as they do. Accordingly, it can beargued that the more educated society becomes the more prone it will be tothinking in an abstract way. It will also become more literate, leading to alarger vocabulary. Words can be seen as ‘thinking tools’, meaning that a largervocabulary will permit more technically subtle thinking. Western societies havebecome highly educated, with everybody in full-time education until around theage of eighteen. And the nature of this education has also become more‘scientific’ over the years. History at school, for example, has moved away fromthe rote-learning of important facts to attempting to understand why a period ofhistory unfolded as it did. This will be compounded by hobbies that reflect agreater ability to think abstractly and increase our ability to do so. This willbe true even of reading low-brow novels or playing computer games. Access to theinternet means that we are reading and stimulating our minds and doing so almostall of the time. One of the most popular internet hobbies, and one we mentionedearlier, is genealogy. Here you must play amateur sleuth: transcribe oldhand-writing, learn Early Modern English, learn basic Latin, and weigh up thesignificance of different clues. Genealogy, as just one example of somethingpopularised by the internet, clearly makes you think in a more abstract way. Itis hard to get our heads around how different life would be for a farm labourerin Russia in 1920. We think in a more abstract way and abstract thinking isprecisely what is tested by Raven’s and by the ‘Similarities’ component of IQtests.So, a narrow intelligence sub-ability—the ability to think abstractly —has beenincreasing.[13] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-13] Indeed, it has beenincreasing to such an extent that it shows up on the IQ tests as a year on yearincrease in IQ scores. Michael A. Woodley of Menie has argued not just that theFlynn Effect is occurring on the less g-loaded parts of IQ tests—on the lessg-loaded abilities—but, also, that it is occurring on the less heritableabilities. Just as we have noted that general intelligence is significantlyheritable, so are the different sub-abilities, but they are heritable todifferent degrees. The Flynn Effect is occurring mainly on the less heritableabilities, further demonstrating that it is mainly an environmental effect.Woodley of Menie argues that, at the same time—as we will see later—there isgood evidence that general intelligence is actually declining. As such, he callsthis the ‘Co-occurrence Model’—because an environmentally caused rise inspecialised cognitive abilities and a genetically caused fall in generalintelligence have ‘co-occurred’.[14] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-14]There is, in fact, nothing especially unusual about these sorts ofco-occurrences in nature. We have already looked at the parallels between IQ andheight. Both are normally distributed on a bell curve, with the largestpercentage in the centre of the curve and smaller and smaller percentages of thepopulation positioned further and further away from it. However, there are otherparallels between IQ and height. Like IQ, height has been rising in Westerncountries throughout the 20th century. The average height of a British adultmale in 1900 was about 5 foot 6. By 1971, this average height had risen to 5foot 10.[15] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-15] As with IQ, theseheight improvements have been concentrated on the more environmentallyinfluenced components of height. Some body measurements, such as wristcircumference, are strongly genetic while others, such as neck circumference,are heavily environmentally influenced.[16][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-16] Similarly, there are differentmeasurements that can make you tall. You could be tall, for example, due tohaving a very long neck. You could be tall, even if you had short legs, byhaving a very long torso. But the driving force behind the growth in heightacross the 20th century has in fact been leg length.[17][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-17] Our legs—but not a lot else—gotlonger suggesting that leg length may be highly environmentally influenced.As with IQ, the secular improvements in height have also slowed down towards theend of the 20th century and in some places stopped, implying that we havereached our genotypic maximum height.[18][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-18] Studies from the US have shown thatthere are no genetic-selection effects on height, when genetic variants thatpredict height are used to predict fertility outcomes in lieu of phenotypicmeasures of height.[19] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-19] Hence, wewould expect the more heritable components of height (such as neck and torsolength) to have remained unchanged over time. This lack of genetic change willhave been swamped by the contribution made to the change in height overgenerations by the increasing length of our legs, however. Thus with height wesee another example of the co-occurrence model. The 20th century has seen aFlynn Effect on height: an increase in height driven exclusively by changesoccurring on the more environmentally sensitive components of height. We are allused to being told that numerous human traits—intelligence, height, physicalbuild, and the development of certain illnesses—are a product of a combinationof genes and environment; nature and nurture. But with the co-occurrence modelwe can be far more specific than this. We can identify which aspects of thetrait are primarily caused by environment and which aspects of the trait areprimarily caused by genetics. This is a far less question-begging model whichallows us to explain a lot more. If we want to understand the rise in obesity,for example, we can look at the different dimensions of obesity and work out howheritable each is and therefore how sensitive each may be to environmentalchange. We can therefore move beyond the rather trite assertion that ‘it’s acombination of environment and genes.’"},{"pageContent":"The Reversal of the Flynn EffectIf this model is accurate we would expect two further phenomena. Firstly, proxymeasures for general intelligence should show evidence that this is in declineand we will see later that this is indeed what is happening. Secondly, thereshould be a limit to and then a reversal of the Flynn Effect. This is becausethe specialised abilities that are being stimulated by changes in theenvironment will have a phenotypic limit. We will eventually reach the absolutemaximum level of this ability that the environment can produce within the boundsof our genetic limitations. Once this happens the Flynn Effect will cease andthe underlying decline in general intelligence—which has been hidden by theFlynn Effect—will start to show up even on the IQ tests.This is precisely what has happened from the mid-1990s onwards. A study byAustrian psychologists Jakob Pietschnig and Martin Voracek showed that, in the1980s, the Flynn Effect began to slow down, year on year.[20][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-20] This would imply that more and morepeople were reaching its limit and the underlying intelligence decline wasrevealing itself. This decline has been documented in the most detail withconscription data from the Scandinavian countries, from the mid-1990s onwards.Almost all young males in these countries undergo around six months ofcompulsory military service and in the early stages of this they are given an IQtest. This leads to extremely large and representative samples; almost theentire male population of any given cohort. It has been shown, now, in Norway,Denmark, and Finland that the IQ scores of conscripts between about 1950, whenrecords began, and around 1997 increased but have decreased thereafter. InNorway, the decrease was 0.38 points per decade between 1996 and 2002 and inDenmark it was 2.70 points per decade between 1996 and 2004.[21][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-21]And there is another fascinating point about these reverse Flynn Effects. Theyhave also been found in Britain, Estonia, France, and the Netherlands, based oneither school pupils or population samples. In the case the Netherlands, thedecline was found to have occurred mainly on general intelligence; on the mostg-loaded parts of the IQ test.[22] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-22]In France, the decline was found to have occurred on the most g-loaded and alsomost heritable intelligence sub-tests, on the parts of the test wheredifferences are the most biologically caused.[23][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-23] This is important because it hasalso been shown that the IQ tests in which results are more heritable are alsomore g-loaded; they are measuring general intelligence to a greater extent.Indeed, the magnitude of the negative relationship between intelligence andfertility is stronger on the more g-loaded—and thus more biologicallyinfluenced—sub-tests within the broader IQ test.[24][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-24] This fits, very neatly, with thehypothesis that general intelligence is decreasing due to biological fertilitypatterns, but this is covered up by a massive rise in more weakly g-loaded andspecialised abilities. When these reach their genotypic maximum, the on-goingfall in general intelligence becomes clear even on the IQ tests themselves.More recently, a very large study of cohorts in which the Flynn Effect hasreversed had added complexity to this picture.[25][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-25] It found that across cultures, thedecline is actually biggest when the measure is less strongly associated with g.Thus, on a larger scale (i.e. between countries), the reversal might stem fromnegative changes in the environment, which in turn may result from declining g,supressing the development of specialised abilities. Consistent with thisexpectation, it was found that per capita immigration was an independentpredictor of this anti-Flynn Effect, and predicted this best when the IQ measurewas most strongly associated with g. Therefore immigration may (as one factordiscussed previously) be directly reducing g, but it also has additionalnegative effects on IQ (specifically on specialised abilities) which areamplified via its influence on the quality of culture and the schoolingenvironment.[26] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-26]In addition, the Flynn Effect is seemingly coming to an end or going intoreverse in some developing countries, but only among elite samples. Thus, acessation and also reversal of the Flynn Effect has been documented in aparticularly wealthy province of Brazil between 1990 and 2000 among 10- to12-year-olds.[27] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-27] These findings areconsistent with the environmental nature of the Flynn Effect. Elite sampleswould reach the genotypic limit of the Flynn Effect more quickly than the nationin general and thus be the first to show a cessation or reversal of IQ gains."},{"pageContent":"The Impact of the Flynn EffectSo, the Flynn Effect works in one direction and selection for lower g inanother, hence the coining of the ‘co-occurrence model’ to describe how itoperates. The Industrial Revolution has had two effects. On the one hand, it hasweakened selection pressure for general intelligence which in turn has set off aprocess whereby selection for general intelligence has eventually gone intoreverse, meaning that there is now a negative correlation between intelligenceand fertility. However, the Industrial Revolution has set off a chain reactionof industrial development, which massively outpaces the consequences of theweakening and eventual reversal in selection for general intelligence. As such,even though people are getting less intelligent (as assessed with g), theirstandard of living is going up. This is, in part, because of the Flynn Effect.This is the other dimension of the Industrial Revolution. It creates a new worldin which people must use and think about machines, in which people need to beeducated, and in which people are compelled to think in a more logical andscientific way. In other words, it forces them to don scientific spectacles,which compel them to focus on categorising and how things work. This would seemto make people more inventive. They would be less able to come up with bigimportant ideas—because these would be a function of genius—but they would beable to gradually develop the big, important ideas in interesting and usefuldirections. Thus, although the rate of important inventions would slow down (asCharles Murray and others have documented), society would keep developing andkeep moving forward industrially because of improvements in narrow cognitiveabilities. A huge advantage of this cognitive specialisation is that it wouldhave made people wealthier, as with more cognitive specialists in a populationthere is more opportunity for division of labour, which means that more peopleare occupying specific micro-niches. Consistent with this, the Flynn Effect hasbeen found to predict both the growth in wealth over time[28][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-28] and also across countries.[29][part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-29] This, of course, would also revealitself on IQ tests as a rise in IQ scores. But, eventually, we would reach thelimit of this process of ability specialisation and would, therefore, no longerbe able to cloak the on-going decline in general intelligence with a rise inspecialised abilities. When that happened—and it seems that it has happened insome places—rates of even micro-innovation would start to decline and we wouldstart to go backwards; we would find ourselves unable to do things that we coulddo in the past to an even greater extent than had been the case before.As Dutton and Charlton have argued, the best way to think of it is in terms ofliving off capital.[30] [part0011_split_004.html#footnote-88517-30] With theIndustrial Revolution, we managed to make an enormous amount of money. We becamequite spectacularly rich because of the brilliant inventions we came up with.This permitted us an extremely high standard of living: the stereotypicalAmerican Dream of the mansion, the country retreat, the jetsetter lifestyle, andso on. But, thereafter, our rate of inventiveness slowly decreased. At firstthis didn’t matter because of the huge interest that our capital was generating;the capital was basically making more capital with very little input on ourpart. Our input was just minor tinkering, little inventions here and there. But,eventually, our rate of inventiveness completely dried up and once this happenedwe were no longer making any new money. So, we had to start living off thecapital and, in order to sustain this, standards of living would necessarilydecline.

TheRaven’s, however, is not a good measure when cohorts of different generationsare compared. This is because the items that comprise the Raven’s test changetheir meaning in more recent cohorts. In earlier cohorts, subjects would havebeen unfamiliar with the items on these kinds of tests and would have needed towork out that rules were involved in solving them. More recent cohorts, however,are more familiar with the tests and, more broadly, understand that a rule needsto be applied. Indeed, they are taught this. As such, the score differencebetween cohorts does not measure a difference in g, but instead reflects therise of a narrow abstract reasoning skill, in essence a ‘simple trick’ that canbe picked up. For a detailed analysis of this issue, see: Fox, M.C. & Mitchum,A.L. (2013) A knowledge based theory of rising scores on ‘culture-free’ tests,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 142, pp. 979–1000. Moreprosaically, modern people are much more likely to simply guess the answer to amultiple-choice answer format test like the Raven’s, which will further boosttheir scores simply by chance alone. British psychologist Chris Brand(1943–2017) estimated that each correctly guessed Raven’s item would raise atestee’s score by 3 whole IQ points, see: Brand, C.R. (1987) British IQ: Keepingup with the times, Nature, 328, 761. The very large gains on the Raven’s test inparticular could therefore be explained by both of these processes acting inconcert.10 [part0011_split_001.html#footnote-88517-10-backlink] A-Levels are the schoolleaving exams in England and Wales.

It is all very well arguing that g is stronglyheritable—based on twin studies—and that the negative correlation between g andfertility means it should be declining. But this is merely a prediction, albeitone that is likely to be accurate. It’s borne out, of course, by the evidencethat the Flynn Effect is a function of specialised, highly environmentallyinfluenced abilities, while overall, the anti-Flynn Effect relates to declinesin less g-loaded abilities that may in turn ultimately be driven by the impactof factors that have caused declining g on the environments that havehistorically nourished these abilities. But, even accepting this, it does notnecessarily prove that general intelligence has been decreasing because of theIndustrial Revolution. We need hard evidence and in this chapter this isprecisely what we will present. Much of the evidence for this has been unearthedby Woodley of Menie and his team, such that evidence for declining generalintelligence for genetic reasons has become known as a ‘Woodley Effect’.[1][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-1]"},{"pageContent":"Simple Reaction TimesIQ tests are an excellent measure when comparing people of the same generationbut, clearly, the Flynn Effect means that they are a poor measure across time.An IQ questionnaire is a relative measure. It ranks people based on their testresults. But it does not give an objective measure of intelligence levels. Itmerely means that they can be compared to other people who take the same test ataround the same time. Edward Dutton and Bruce Charlton have noted that IQtesting is like running races and placing people into first, second, thirdpositions and so on, but never using a stopwatch: ‘This makes it impossible toknow, over the decades, whether people are running faster, slower or staying thesame: What is needed is some kind of objective measure of intelligence: astopwatch.’[2] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-2]Bruce Charlton, who we met earlier, came up with the idea of measuring long-termtrends in general intelligence using a stopwatch measure: in other wordsstudying the historical changes in the simple reaction time (sRT) measurement.Reaction times are such a reliable proxy for general intelligence that eminentintelligence researchers such as Arthur Jensen,[3][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-3] Hans Eysenck,[4][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-4] and Ian Deary[5][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-5] have promoted them as alternatives topencil-and-paper IQ tests. It is possible to use (simple) reaction time (inparticular) to measure long-term trends in general intelligence because reactiontimes have been measured since the late 1800s, and, as we have discussed, theyrepresent an objective correlate of general intelligence. Simple reaction times(sRT) typically involve something like pressing a button as quickly as possiblein response to a light being switched on, and measuring the time taken. Thisprocedure usually takes a fraction of a second. While the correlation with IQ isnot large, sRTs have the huge advantage of being objective and quantifiablephysiological measures. It is widely accepted, by prominent researchers inintelligence such as Arthur Jensen and others, that reaction times are a robustratio-scale measures of cognitive ability. This means that, unlikepencil-and-paper IQ tests, they have a true zero, and everyone who ever hastheir reaction time speed measured can (in theory) be meaningfully compared witheveryone else, irrespective of the year in which they were born. It might beasked how we can measure general intelligence in Victorian England. The answeris that Galton measured simple reaction time, which is a measure of factors suchas nerve conduction velocity that are considered by some prominent researchers(i.e. Arthur Jensen) to be fundamental determinants of g. A critical strength ofthese measures is that the meaning of the measures does not change over time.The low-g loading of measures like simple reaction time is therefore notrelevant to their ability (as ratio-scale measures) to reliably track the changein the underlying g over time. The critical thing is that they exhibit theproperty of measurement invariance.In 2012, Woodley of Menie discovered a published survey of historical reactiontime data.[6] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-6] This demonstratedsomething very striking. There had apparently been a big slowing of sRTs fromthe time of Sir Francis Galton in the late 19th century until the late 20thcentury. It should be stressed that the instruments used to measure reactionstimes in the 1880s are accepted as having been perfectly adequate for the job.They had adequate temporal resolution. These data carried the strong implicationthat there had been a rapid and substantial decline in g over the past hundredyears. This initial finding was improved with the addition of extra data and amore sophisticated analysis, and was published in the leading journalIntelligence.[7] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-7] It was thenreplicated and confirmed.[8] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-8] Thisreplication study furthermore found, using sRTs, that the decline in g had beenaround 1 IQ point per decade between 1885 and the year 2004. That is about 10points, in a century—and probably more over the past two hundred years. Duttonand Charlton have explained that, to put this in perspective, 15 points would beapproximately the difference in average IQ between a low level security guard(85) and a police constable (100), or between a high school science teacher(115) and a biology professor at an elite university (130).[9][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-9] In other words, in terms ofintelligence, the average Englishman from about 1850 would be in roughly the top15% of the population in the year 2000—and the difference would be even largerif we extrapolated back further towards about 1800 when the IndustrialRevolution began to initiate massive demographic changes in the Britishpopulation.Woodley of Menie’s numbers, note Dutton and Charlton, are not intended to beprecise but they are certainly a rough guide to what is happening. Dutton andCharlton put it very trenchantly in summarising what these numbers mean. Theymean that in everyday terms:‘the academics of the year 2000 were the school teachers of 1900, the schoolteachers of the year 2000 would have been the factory workers (the averagepeople) of 1900, the office workers and policemen of the year 2000 were the farmlabourers of 1900, those who were around 10 to 15 IQ points below average atthat time. The low-level security guards and shop assistants of the year 2000were probably in the workhouse, on the streets, or dead in 1900. The substantiallong-term unemployed or unemployable, the dependent ‘underclass’ of the year2000, simply didn’t exist in 1900. And even this estimate is ignoring theexpansion of education since 1900, which expanded the middle class occupationsand would, in itself, reduce the average intelligence of academics and teachersand even shop assistants in 2000 compared to what they would have been in1900.’[10] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-10]What this means, in terms of everyday life, should be quite clear by now fromour table setting out the correlates of intelligence. And new studies arereplicating the finding. A study in Sweden, for example, based on a sample ofmore than 7,000 people found that simple audio reaction times had slowed bybetween 3 and 16 milliseconds between 1959 and 1985.[11][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-11]"},{"pageContent":"Colour DiscriminationBut reaction times are not the only objective measure that correlates withgeneral intelligence which is showing a decline. Colour discrimination—theability to distinguish between ever more subtle shades of colour—is declining aswell. Now, we might think, ‘What on earth has colour discrimination got to dowith g?’ But, in fact, it has a great deal to do with it. As we have seen,Spearman showed that pitch discrimination strongly correlated with otherexamples of academic performance and, by implication, with general intelligence.Spearman also found that teacher ratings of pupil ability correlated with theability of these pupils to judge subtle differences in lightness and weight. Assuch, Spearman posited a ‘general factor of discriminative ability’,[12][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-12] which he expected to correlate verystrongly with general intelligence. Sensory discrimination correlates with gbecause the more acute your sensory discrimination is, the better able you areto notice subtle differences between physical quantities which can help you tomore efficiently solve problems. This is why more recent studies have found thecorrelation between general intelligence and general discriminative ability tobe as high as 0.92 in some cases.[13][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-13] It follows that the more intelligentpeople are, the better they will be able to discriminate among increasinglysubtle differences in colour.A 2015 study found four standardisation studies conducted between the 1980s and2000s employing the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Colour Perception Test, which wasdeveloped in 1943. This test was first found to correlate with IQ in the 1960s.The participants have to physically arrange a series of 85 caps, each of a verysubtly different hue, along a spectrum defined by two clear end caps such asblue and green or pink and purple. Participants are awarded an error penalty foreach cap that is in the wrong order on the spectrum, allowing a quantificationof their colour discrimination abilities. It was found that, across the fourstudies, colour discrimination ability had significantly declined, at theequivalent rate of 3.15 IQ points per decade—even after controlling for the IQof the countries from which the participants were drawn (Belgium, Finland, UK,and US) and also participant age. Clearly, this is what we would expect if ourhypothesis is correct.[14] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-14]"},{"pageContent":"Use of High-Difficulty WordsThe more intelligent people are, the larger are their vocabularies and the morelikely they are to use difficult-to-learn words. Indeed, this seems to be fairlyclear to people. We know, implicitly, that intelligent people are more prone tousing ‘big words’ or at least unusual words. This fits in with the associationbetween g and colour discrimination. The more intelligent people are, the moreable they are to perceive subtle differences; differences which require slightlydifferent words in order to accurately encapsulate them. This use of thetechnically correct word by the highly intelligent can be distinguished fromintellectual poseurs who try to showcase their supposed intelligence by usinghigh-order words quite unnecessarily in order to intellectually intimidatepeople and to attempt to appear cleverer than they are. But, that aside, part ofthe linguistic intelligence dimension of the IQ test is vocabulary and theability to understand subtle differences in the meaning of words. Scores onvocabulary tests are very highly g-loaded and highly heritable.[15][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-15]To test what was happening with vocabulary, a study in 2015[16][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-16] examined historical changes in thefrequency with which words from the highly g-loaded WORDSUM test were employedacross 5.9 million texts published between 1850 and 2005. They also examined theassociation between WORDSUM scores and completed fertility; how many childrenyou have had by middle age when, typically, you don’t have any more. They foundthat words with higher difficulties (those that are harder to learn and usecorrectly) and also stronger negative correlations between pass rates andcompleted fertility declined in usage over time. By contrast, less difficultwords and less strongly selected words increased in use over time—an effect thatwas predicted by rising literacy. This finding would be consistent with theFlynn Effect stemming, in part, from the vocabulary enriching effects ofincreases in education level, which would be part of Flynn’s ‘scientificspectacles’ model. These findings persisted when explicitly controlled for wordage, and other confounding factors.More recently, another study has taken this further in a way that clearlyillustrates the accuracy of our model. Google’s Ngram Viewer (a truly massivetext archive of scanned books, newspapers, scientific journals, and otherprinted materials) includes texts that go all the way back to the 16th century.So, drawing upon this, Woodley of Menie and colleagues analysed changes in theuse of the four very high difficulty WORDSUM words over time between the 16thcentury and the modern day. They found that the use of these words increasesfrom the 16th century up until the early 19th century and then goes intodecline, as can be observed in Figure 7. This is precisely what our model of therise and fall of Western intelligence would predict, if indeed the usagepatterns of these words among those who contribute to literature really doesreflect their underlying level of g.[17][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-17]C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00007.jpeg]Figure 7. The usage frequency trend for a common factor of the four hardestWORDSUM words between 1600 and 2005, fitted to a third-order polynomialcurve.[18] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-18]This system also allows us to estimate roughly how intelligent we are comparedto people in the past. Based on the usage frequencies of these WORDSUM words, wecurrently have about the same level of g as people in the mid-18th century; ageneration or two before the Industrial Revolution. It must be remembered thatWORDSUM is likely to be subject to the Flynn Effect (recall that the usage ofeasy words is actually increasing), which may make our vocabulary levelartificially high in relation to our underlying general intelligence. So,putting these influences aside, it is likely that we have regressed considerablyfurther, genetically, than the mid-18th century."},{"pageContent":"Backward Digit SpanAnother good proxy for g is working memory, or the capacity to manipulateinformation committed to memory for the purposes of solving problems. Moreintelligent people tend to be better at this. This makes sense because if youhave a good working memory the amount of information that you can handle will begreater, allowing for more complex problems to be solved. This ability isreflected in measures such as ‘digit span’, where the subject is presented witha list of digits (called bits) and must immediately repeat them back frommemory. If they can do this successfully then they move onto a longer list. Thenumber of bits that the subject can recall successfully is their ‘digit span’.They can be asked to recall the digits in the order in which they were given(‘forward’), which gives a measure of short-term memory, or they can be asked torecall them in the opposite order. The latter is known as their ‘backward digitspan’ and is a measure of working memory. Clearly, remembering numbers inreverse order is likely to be more cognitively demanding and is therefore a muchbetter measure of g.In a re-analysis of previously published data, covering the period 1923 to 2008,it was found that forward digit span (short-term memory) had slightly improvedover this period. However, backward digit span (working memory) haddeclined—equating to an IQ loss of 0.16 points per decade. In other words, wehave gotten better at the less g-loaded memory task and worse at the moreg-loaded task over a period of 85 years. This is clearly more evidence for theco-occurrence model.[19] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-19]Replication of this finding came from a very large meta-analysis of short-termand working memory performance from several countries across several decades,conducted by a team from King’s College London. In this study, it was found thattwo separate measures of working memory (backwards digits and Corsi Blocks) bothshowed evidence of having declined, even after controlling for the sample’snational origin, its age, and differences in the way in which the measurementhad been obtained. The short-term memory tests (forwards digits and theshort-term memory variants of the Corsi Blocks test) both showed the oppositetrend—a Flynn Effect, exactly as predicted by the co-occurrence model.[20][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-20]Improvements in the environment are therefore raising certain weakly g-loadedabilities, such as short-term memory, but, at the same time, generalintelligence (as reflected in working memory) has been decreasing throughout the20th century."},{"pageContent":"Spatial PerceptionTwo Austrian psychologists—Jakob Pietschnig (who we met earlier) and GeorgGittler—have worked together to examine changes in scores on a test of spatialperception: the three-dimensional cube test (3DC).[21][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-21] As we’ve seen, spatial intelligenceis an excellent measure of general intelligence. The two Austrian researchersfound 96 samples (amounting to 13,172 people) to whom the 3DC had beenadministered in German-speaking countries between 1977 and 2014. They‘meta-analysed’ the results—this is a statistical procedure whereby you combinedata from multiple studies—meaning that they could see what had happened tospatial perception ability in German-speaking countries over this period ofalmost 40 years.Their results were entirely consistent with the other lines of evidence thatwe’ve examined and, in particular, with IQ scores. There was an initial increasein performance (a Flynn Effect) and a subsequent decrease in performance (anegative Flynn Effect) when controlling for age, sex, and sample type—whetherexamining general population, convenience samples (e.g. university students), ora mixture of the two. Thus, it would appear that spatial perception performancewas pushed to its phenotypic limit by environmental factors after which theunderlying decline in general intelligence began to reveal itself.

He is best known for his theoryof cognitive development, in which he charted the four stages of developmentthat children go through up until around the age of 16. From birth to age 2 theyare in the ‘sensorimotor stage’ in which they experience the world purely interms of sensory stimuli. In stage two, from age 2 to 7, they are in the‘pre-operational stage’. They have stable mental concepts, but difficulty withlogic. In stage three (7–11), the ‘concrete operational stage’, they can thinklogically but are still limited in terms of what they can physically manipulate.Finally, in the ‘formal operational stage’ (11–16), they develop their abstractreasoning skills.Piaget devised a series of methods for testing where children weredevelopmentally, which, to a significant degree, can be regarded as measuringintelligence.[22] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-22] One such measureis ‘volume and heaviness’, which looks at the ability of children to correctlyestimate these quantities. British psychologist Michael Shayer and otherscompared English 11-year-old school children in terms of their scores on this,looking at samples from 1975 and then from 2003. They found that children hadbecome considerably worse at it: girls by roughly half a standard deviation andboys by an entire standard deviation. Whilst this would be in line with averagegeneral intelligence decreasing over this period, these declines are simply toomassive to have been caused by this process alone.[23][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-23] A recent analysis noted that thecollapse seems to have been concentrated specifically in the numbers of topscorers over this period.[24] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-24]"},{"pageContent":"Genius Levels and Macro-innovationsAs has been discussed already, per capita rates of genius and themacro-innovations for which they are responsible have been declining since theearly to middle of the 19th century. Charles Murray (whom we encounteredearlier) has shown that these major scientific breakthroughs reached a peakaround 1825.[25] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-25] This, of course, isthe height of the Industrial Revolution. Then they go into decline, as do therates of macro-innovation. Based on Murray’s published data, we have calculatedper capita levels of genius across time restricted to just the English-speakingcountries. The trend can be seen in Figure 8.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00008.jpeg]Figure 8. Per capita geniuses in USA, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia,1600–2000 (using publically released data from Charles Murray), fitted to athird-order polynomial curve.It should be stressed that there are likely to be other factors behind thedecline in genius and macro-innovation apart from simply falling g. As wasdiscussed previously, genius may be dependent in part upon rare genes with largeeffects on the phenotype that do not ‘breed true’—meaning that they do nottransmit faithfully across the generations. It may also be dependent oninteraction between genes that have a low probability of combining in a singleindividual (giving rise to a very unusual kind of personality). This means thatas populations shrink, due to the demographic transition (i.e. the generaltendency for Western populations to have fewer children since the IndustrialRevolution), the size of the ‘pool’ of these rare gene combinations hasdecreased and so they are less likely to occur. Recall also that genius islikely a highly group-selected manifestation of intelligence—geniuses help theirpopulations during times of war, and their innovations have furthermore fuelledthe rise of empires. This means that populations that are in situations of waror which are building empires, also placing them in situations of conflict, willbe under group selection pressure and the group with the optimum number ofgeniuses will be more likely to expand. This will increase the probability ofrare genetic variants and combinations of variants emerging, leading to newgeniuses.Population shrinking in the West is in part, therefore, a manifestation of thecollapse of group selection, and is characterised by decreasing inter-groupconflict (i.e. reductions in the frequency, duration, and lethality of warfare).The environment is milder today climatologically (warmer temperature hashistorically promoted inter-group peace[26][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-26]), furthermore ecological stressstemming from disease is largely absent from modern life, with the advent ofmodern medicine. The result is that the populations of contemporary Westerncountries are pacified and are no longer inclined towards battling for livingspace. So, selection pressure for genius has decreased and, accordingly, therelevant genetic combinations are not being selected for and they are lesslikely to combine anyway because the (native) population is shrinking. So, wehave a perfect storm—selection for low IQ comes at the expense of group-levelfitness, which via population shrinking massively reduces the frequency of therare elements that must be present in order for genius to manifest.It should be emphasised, however, that the declining numbers of geniuses mayalso have a partly environmental cause, though this is itself underpinned by ourdeclining general intelligence. In their book The Genius Famine, Edward Duttonand Bruce Charlton have explored in depth why levels of genius aredeclining.[27] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-27] They concur that asignificant part of the decline is directly genetic: average intelligence isdecreasing and, therefore, the average intelligence of the high-IQ outliers isalso decreasing. But they suggest that certain social factors conspire to makethis ‘famine’ even worse. Intelligence is correlated with a trait known as‘Intellect’: being open to new ideas and being fascinated by intellectualpursuit. Until the 1950s, this kind of attitude underpinned the Britishuniversity. Academics were under no pressure to regularly publish or obtaingrants. They were expected to teach and were given vast amounts of time to thinkand do research based on the hope that some would produce works of genius.Charles Murray has observed that, in the 19th century, religion was also part ofthe reason that universities were created along these lines. Their purpose wasto reach a greater understanding of God’s creation—a practice calledNeo-Thomism, a reference to the medieval scholastic St. Thomas Aquinas whoattempted to prove God’s existence using logic. If this academic system involvedfrittering away money—with most academics not publishing anything—this didn’tmatter. Some things are more important than money, such as the glory of God.[28][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-28]Since the 1960s, universities have become bureaucratic businesses. This reflectsthe anti-intellectual, anti-religious attitude that their purpose is to makemoney. Academics contribute to this by getting funding, publishing frequently,and attending conferences. All of this is anathema to the genius, who wants tobe left alone to solve their chosen problem.[29][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-29] Remember that the genius, as well asbeing highly intelligent, is moderately low in Agreeableness andConscientiousness, and moderately high in Psychoticism. They also won’t tick thebureaucratic boxes that get you an academic position—Francis Crick, discovererof DNA, was rejected from Cambridge, failed to get a top mark in his bachelor’sdegree, and dropped out of assorted PhDs. As such, universities are less likelyto appoint genius types. They will appoint what Dutton and Charlton call the‘head girl’ (at UK schools)—quite intelligent, socially skilled, conscientious,but absolutely not a genius. This person will be excellent at playing theacademic game and will make a great colleague. But they won’t innovate; won’trock the boat. Once upon a time, they note, a ‘country vicar’ had lots of freetime to research, but with the shrinking of the Church, the days of theVictorian ‘scholar-rector’ are long gone as well. The genius has no institutionto nurture him and his potential will not be fulfilled.[30][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-30] So, an indirect consequence of thedecline in intelligence is a decrease in the degree to which people in generalvenerate ‘intellectual’ pursuits and a rise in the degree to which theyemphasise simply making money. For both genetic and environmental reasons, withan ultimately genetic cause, we see a decline in the levels of genius since themid-19th century. This is consistent with the expectation that g is in decline."},{"pageContent":"CreativityWe have already met the innovative German psychologist Hans Eysenck. Eysenckwanted to understand the kind of qualities which led to genius and this meantthat he was also fascinated by the idea of ‘creativity’. The genius, Eysenckargued, is characterised, as we have seen, by moderately high Psychoticism andextremely high g. It is this combination that allows geniuses to think in anextraordinarily intellectually creative way and so make fantastic breakthroughs.It follows that lower levels of creativity—wherein people have interesting andoriginal ideas but do not come up with anything that fundamentally changes theworld—would be characterised by a lower dose of the same kind of psychologicalmake-up. In other words, people whom we would regard as ‘creative’—artists,poets, novelists, comedians, as well as the more original journalists andacademics—would be likely to combine moderately high Psychoticism and highintelligence, but not in as pronounced a way as those whom we would accept weregeniuses.Eysenck produced sound evidence to support this contention. He developed a testof creative thinking and administered it, alongside an IQ test, to various largesamples of students. He found that up to an IQ of 120, creativity was predictedby intelligence: the more intelligent you were, the more creative you were.However, beyond an IQ of 120, creativity ceased to be significantly predicted byintelligence and personality differences became the driving factor. So, to besignificantly creative you need foundations of high IQ, but extreme creativityis built upon those foundations with moderately high Psychoticism.[31][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-31] Accordingly, tests of creativity areuseful for our purposes because they are partly tests of intelligence. Ifintelligence is declining then we would expect levels of creativity to bedeclining and there is evidence that is exactly what is happening.Korean psychologist Kyung Hee Kim, of the College of William and Mary inVirginia, published an important paper in 2011 in the Creativity ResearchJournal,[32] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-32] entitled ‘TheCreativity Crisis’. Her findings made something of a stir at the time and wereeven reported on the front page of the American magazine Newsweek. Kim employedthe Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, which was developed in 1966 andadministered to large samples of people—ranging from kindergarten pupils throughto ‘12th grade (17–18-year-old) students and adults’—in 1974, 1984, 1990, 1998,and 2008. This meant that she could compare average levels of creativity acrosstime with a very large sample of people, 272,599 of them to be exact. She foundthat since 1990 creativity scores had significantly decreased—in other wordspeople are becoming less creative. This is what might be expected to happen ifpeople were becoming less intelligent. Declining creativity should have reallife implications, especially in terms of the quality of the arts andentertainment. It is certainly consistent with British comedy critics arguingthat the high point of the UK sitcom was the 1970s and 1980s and that thegenre’s originality and creativity has declined since that time.[33][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-33] It is also consistent with theproduction of modern ‘remakes’ of assorted comedies from this period, includingof Dad’s Army and The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin. The anecdotal evidenceof the decline of the British sitcom is in line with Kim’s findings and, inturn, with the decline of intelligence."},{"pageContent":"Putting it All Together: The g.h Chronometric FactorThe best way to show that these ‘Woodley Effects’ are validly measuring someunderlying change in g would be to demonstrate that they correlate with oneanother in time. In other words, does the decline in working memory correlatewith the decline in simple reaction times? What about the decline in theutilisation frequencies of hard-to-learn vocabulary words?This is precisely the approach used by Woodley of Menie and colleagues to crossvalidate these declines. The method employed was very similar to the idea of theg factor, which was discussed previously. You will recall that the g factor is asort of ‘super-correlation’ among various measures of intelligence. It is thereason why people who do well on one type of ability measure typically do wellacross many such measures. This same approach was used in cross-validating these‘Woodley Effects’. It was predicted that the trend in one indicator of decliningg should predict the decline in the others as well, and that, furthermore, thoseputative Woodley Effects should tend to cluster together in time—forming acommon chronometric (literally ‘measurement in time’) heritable generalintelligence (g.h) factor. The g.h chronometric factor was made up of time trenddata on five variables: 1. Slowing simple visual reaction times. 2. Declining working memory. 3. Declining utilisation frequencies of four hard-to-learn vocabulary words tracked using Google Ngram Viewer. 4. Declining per capita rates of US and UK macro-innovation (weighted based on the populations of these two countries), which capture the decline in complex problem solving ability. 5. The utilisation frequencies of ten altruism indicating words, also tracked via Google Ngram Viewer.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00009.jpeg]Figure 9.

This is indeed what was found. So, we are not onlybecoming less intelligent, we are becoming less kind and less cooperative. Thedecline in chronometric heritable general intelligence can be seen in Figure 9."},{"pageContent":"The Smoking Gun: A Decline in the Frequencies of Variants in the GenomeAssociated with Educational Attainment and gSo far then we have looked at phenotypic evidence, which indicates (quitestrongly) that g is declining and doing so for largely genetic reasons. But nowlet’s turn to the smoking gun. A hugely important study, led by a Chineseresearcher called Augustine Kong, of the University of Iceland, was published inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2017.[36][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-36] In this study, his team identified alarge number of genetic variants which collectively predicted both educationalattainment and g. They called this set of variants POLYEDU (polygenic score foreducational attainment). The team investigated the effect of this polygenicscore on the reproductive history of 109,120 Icelanders and the impact of thishistory on the Icelandic gene pool over time. They demonstrated that those whohad higher POLYEDU had delayed reproduction and had fewer children than didIcelanders carrying lower POLYEDU. So far this result is somewhat consistentwith those of the previously discussed studies that used polygenic scores foreducational attainment to predict fertility outcomes. However, Kong and his teamwent one step further. Based on a sample of 129,808 Icelanders born between 1910and 1990, they found that the average POLYEDU—the average percentage of thepopulation with genes that predict high educational attainment—had beendeclining at a rate of roughly 0.010 standard units per decade, which, theynoted, ‘is substantial on an evolutionary timescale’. They added that ‘becausePOLYEDU only captures a fraction of the overall underlying genetic component thelatter could be declining at a rate that is two to three times faster.’ Theirfindings can be observed in Figure 10.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00010.jpeg]Figure 10. The decline in POLYEDU in Iceland, between the 1910–20 and 1980–90birth cohort groupings, fitted to a third-order polynomial curve.[37][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-37]This observed decline over decades in the population’s levels of POLYEDU wasfound to be highly consistent with the decline predicted using the negativeassociation between POLYEDU and fertility, and the positive association betweenPOLYEDU and age at first birth (recall that those with high IQ don’t simplyproduce fewer children, they produce them later in life). Kong and hiscolleagues even went so far as to estimate the IQ loss that should result fromthis process—0.3 points per decade. It is important to note that in arriving atthis estimate they employed a very low value of the heritability of IQ (0.3) intheir formula. As was discussed earlier, the actual heritability of IQ (asdetermined using twin studies, which have the advantage of capturing all geneticvariants that go into a given trait) is likely to be substantially higher(closer to 0.8). When Kong and his colleague’s numbers are adjusted to take thisinto account, the decline increases to around 0.8 points per decade—meaning thatthe population of Iceland may be losing IQ at a rate very close to a whole pointper decade.[38] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-38]This research would seem to strongly vindicate our theory. We have already seenthat education level is strongly genetically correlated with g. So, g shouldhave declined between 1910 and 1990 among the people of Iceland. The averageIcelander born in 1910 was cleverer than the average Icelander born in 1990 interms of heritable general intelligence. This decline in Iceland has furthermoreoccurred exclusively for genetic reasons and the key reason is the low andpostponed fertility of the highly intelligent in Iceland, especially the highlyintelligent women."},{"pageContent":"What about Pollution?Some researchers have argued that declining general intelligence is caused byenvironmental pollution. The claim to this effect has been presented by BarbaraDemeneix. Demeneix (formerly Jenkins) is a British biologist who took heroriginal degree at Swansea University in Wales. But since 1990 she has run alaboratory at the Natural History Museum in Paris. In her 2014 book Losing OurMinds,[39] [part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-39] Demeneix argues that therise in pollution from certain kinds of plastic and other modern pollutants,coupled with the effects of ‘ever present neurotoxins’ in the environment and inour diets (such as lead, mercury, and alcohol), significantly explains theevidence for IQ (specifically g) decline. In particular, these neurotoxins actas endocrine disruptors, leading to epigenetic changes—alteration of geneticexpression—in the early stages foetal development that have resulted in reducedg.A team of researchers have tested Demeneix’s neurotoxin theory. They created amodel in which they predicted the decline in general intelligence (measured viathe chronometric g.h factor presented in Figure 9), using a neurotoxin factor(comprised of environmental measures of lead, mercury, and persistent organicpollutants, along with per capita alcohol consumption for the US and UK) and apolygenic score factor. This was comprised of genetic variants which predict gsampled from individuals of different ages, binned based on birth year—sourcedfrom the aforementioned Iceland study and also from a smaller study presentingsimilar findings for cohorts born between 1919 and 1955 in the USA. They foundthat changes in polygenic scores predicted around 25% of the variance in thechange in g.h over time. Changes in neurotoxic exposure did not significantlypredict any of the variance in g.h, however.[40][part0012_split_013.html#footnote-90563-40] The neurotoxin theory thereforesimply does not seem to be supported by the data."},{"pageContent":"Why Did the Murder Rate Continue to Decline?We have used the falling murder rate up until the Industrial Revolution asevidence of rising general intelligence. This being the case, it might be askedwhy the murder rate continued to fall from 1800 onwards, if g was in factdeclining. Shouldn’t the murder rate have risen? There are three reasons forthis. Firstly, the British state continued executing murderers right up untilthe 1960s. Accordingly, there was a degree to which, in every generation, thegenes which would incline people to commit murder were being removed from thepopulation. Related to this is the finding (discussed previously) that slow lifehistory orientation (K) is currently favoured by selection in Westernpopulations. As high-K is associated with low criminality, parallel geneticchanges in K could be compensating, or even overcoming, the expected effect ofdeclining g on promoting criminality.Secondly, we have to think about the circumstances that would push people intocommitting murder. Most murders in pre-modern England were not premeditated butwere, rather, the result of fighting. They occurred ‘in the heat of the moment’.People would be more likely to lose self-control—to the extent of committingmurder—if they were subject to stress due to financial worries, constant fear ofdeath, illness and want, and chronic pain. These would all have been relativelyconstant between the Middle Ages and 1800, because living standards changed verylittle. This, of course, means that the falling murder rate had little to dowith environment and can be plausibly partly explained by rising g. However,with the Industrial Revolution, environmental factors that promoted murder werevery substantially reduced to an extent that their effects outpaced theintelligence decline, as evidenced by the on-going construction of anincreasingly comfortable society.Since the abolition of hanging for murder in the 1960s, it can be argued thatthe suppression of environmental triggers is the main explanation behind themurder rate remaining relatively low by historical standards. This must be takentogether with technological and social advances—themselves ultimately a productof the Industrial Revolution—which make it much more difficult to ‘get away withmurder’, including DNA evidence, ubiquitous CCTV, and a large, trained, andequipped police force.The third reason is simply the Flynn Effect. As we have discussed, the FlynnEffect—although it does not occur on general intelligence and is, in reality,cloaking a decline in this—is caused by industrial society making us think in amore analytic way. This is because it pushes various specialised abilities atthe base of the intelligence pyramid to their genotypic limit. The result ofthis is that we become more educated and more specialised, resulting in theability to generate more and more micro-innovations. These micro-innovations, aslong as their effect outpaces the on-going decline in general intelligence, leadto economic growth and thus reduced environmental instability. This, in turn,makes us less stressed, less on edge, and less inclined to commit murder whenthe circumstances are controlled for. Thus the decline in criminality is likelydriven by both environmental and genetic changes favouring slower life historyorientation in Western populations."},{"pageContent":"Should We Be Telling You This?So, general intelligence appears to be declining in just the way that we wouldpredict. We have no desire to be doom-mongers or to unreasonably speculate.‘Speculation’ is a word often thrown at researchers when other researchersdislike their findings. It is defined as ‘making conjecture without firmevidence’. But we have seen that g underpins civilisation and is the motor forthe development of civilisation. Therefore, it is neither doom-mongering norspeculation to assert that the decline of g will lead to the reversal ofcivilisation. We have ‘firm evidence’ with which to make this assertion. And wehave seen that g is indeed declining and there is a substantial amount ofevidence for this, all of it pointing in the same direction. It logicallyfollows, therefore, that civilisation will decline.Now, some scientists would suggest that this raises a moral question. We alreadyresponded to these kinds of questions with regard to the concept ofintelligence. They argue that, as researchers, we have a kind of moralresponsibility to the broader society and if we persuade that society thatcivilisation is going to decline—even if it is true—then we are inciting fearand panic and potentially stirring up unrest and chaos. As such, we have a moralduty to suppress our findings or to only reveal them when there is ‘moreevidence’. And, presumably, the time when the level of evidence is sufficientwill never arrive, because you can always ask for more evidence when you areunhappy with what the available evidence demonstrates. You can always demand, ofthose whose findings you dislike, that they respond to an infinite regress ofincreasingly unlikely possibilities or that they prove a series of negatives(which are inherently impossible to prove) to your subjective satisfaction. But,of course, this is a highly inconsistent position, because if you demanded it ofall scientists then nothing could ever be proved, no action could ever be taken,and civilisation would collapse. There could be no cars, and no aeroplanes,because there would always be insufficient proof of their safety.Our response is that we have substantial evidence for our theory and, once more,the ‘moral argument’—which should, anyway, be irrelevant as science isamoral—can simply be turned around. By suppressing these findings, we areensuring that we will do nothing to slow down, adapt to, or even prevent thedecline of civilisation. It is the act of failing to publicise the findingswhich will, thus, hasten unrest and chaos. It is that act which is truly‘immoral’ and ‘irresponsible’. So, it is quite reasonable to assert that thedecline in intelligence is happening and it will lead to the decline ofcivilisation.Many of us, raised in a context of constant scientific progress in which it wasassumed we’d one day colonise space, may find this idea astonishing. But weshouldn’t be astonished. It has happened before and it is very likely to happenagain. It seems to be a law of human history.1 [part0012_split_000.html#footnote-90563-1-backlink] Sarraf, M.

We are most unlikely to ever be able to do so, so we mustcontent ourselves with living fallen lives in a fallen world."},{"pageContent":"The FallIn many ways, this is the Christian view of the world. Perfection existed in theGarden of Eden. Life may not have been technologically complicated, but whocares. We only need technology to overcome suffering and there was no realsuffering. Or, at least, there was no suffering until we disobeyed God by eatingthe fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. We were punished for this by being castout into an unkind world in which men had to toil the earth and women had tosuffer the agonies of childbirth. This religious way of thinking may seem aliento us now, but it can be seen in many far more modern world-views. As far asmedieval and even 16th-century Europeans were concerned, Ancient Rome was aglorious past just as entrancing and inspiring as the Garden of Eden. You couldnot possibly hope to recreate this fantastic ‘before-time’ of philosophical,mathematical, and literary genius. You just weren’t good enough to do that. Youwould never reach such stratospheric heights again. You must merely attempt, asfar as possible, to return to it by imitating it. Accordingly, education wascentred on Latin and Classical literature and any new literature had toultimately be grounded in Classical tales and in Classical literary forms. The17th-century playwright Ben Jonson (1572–1637) criticised his contemporary,William Shakespeare (1564–1616), for daring to deviate from these Classicalguidelines. This view is so alien to people raised in a society based around‘progress’ and novelty: our best days are long behind us and all we can hope todo is return to them. In many ways, this was the very essence of the Renaissanceand even the Reformation, which conceived of a purer, superior Church, back atthe time of Christ.[1] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-1]Many modern philosophies also hold to this view. For the 18th-century Swissphilosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), the glorious past of humanity—theGarden of Eden, if you like—can be found among tribes or, at least, among hisRomanticised, de-fanged understanding of tribes.[2][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-2] These, according to Rousseau, aresocial organisations in which there is no real hierarchy and everyone workstogether for the common good. As such, the ‘will of the people’ willpredominate.[3] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-3] This way of thinkingwas taken up by nationalists and communists alike. For nationalists, like theGerman Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), there was a glorious past of a pureGerman nation held together by blood, soil, language, and religion and withoutany ‘decadent’ foreign influences. The city was polluted by precisely theseinfluences but this honest past had been kept alive in the German peasantfarmer. As such, we need to imitate peasant culture, preserve peasant culturelike onions in vinegar—rejuvenate peasant culture and so return to the gloriouspast.[4] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-4] This way of thinking spreadaround Europe and can be seen in nationalistic movements in all Europeancountries. In Finland, for example, the least Swedish-influenced area of thecountry was considered to be Karelia in the east, on the Russian border. Assuch, anthropologists were despatched there to interview the peasants andcollect their folktales, which were ultimately published, in 1831, as thenascent nation’s national epic Kalevala. This unveiled a wonderful Finnish pastin which the country had been an independent nation; something to strivetowards, something to bring back to life by idolising Finnish peasantculture.[5] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-5]"},{"pageContent":"ProgressA rather different view also developed, perhaps indirectly from Rousseau butthere are also Christian dimensions to it. This can be summarised as the beliefthat ‘things can only get better’. Our best days are not in the past. In fact,the past is a dreadful place and we should reject everything about it. Our bestdays lie in the future and, in fact, some kind of future state of perfection isnot beyond our reach. This understanding of the world can be seen in the worksof the 19th-century German philosopher Georg W.F. Hegel (1770–1831). For Hegel,all History was a process by which God, or the Absolute, attainedself-knowledge. This process of God getting to know himself played itself out inthis world with a series of dominant ways of thinking or ‘Spirits of the Age’.Each system of thought—‘thesis’—would lead to a reaction against it; an‘antithesis’. This would lead to the production of a new thought; a ‘synthesis’.And so History progressed towards the Absolute fully understanding Himself;towards a future perfection.[6] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-6]Ideologies such as Marxism can be understood to be in line with this philosophy.For Karl Marx (1818–1883), History unfolds according to Hegel’s principles andthe end of history is reached with the achievement of a communist utopia. Assuch, there is constant striving in Marxism, and related ideologies, towards theutopian future, which never seems to arrive because it is always in the future.There is a state of eternal Revolution, in which the symbols of the past, and inwhich anything seen as old-fashioned, must be shunned so we can hasten towardsthis future perfection and not slide back into the unfair, capitalist world ofthe past. Drawing on this ideology, various communist parties attempted tocreate this ‘Heaven on Earth’ in many countries. However, as the utopia isalways in the future, they constantly had to fight against ‘enemies’ who mighttake them back into the past (reactionaries). One way they did this was throughbreaking connections to the past; driving out anything that was symbolic of the‘past’ and of ‘outdated’ ways of thinking. This can be seen in the way that theCultural Marxist movement influenced the English language. The cultural vanguarddecides that a particular word is ‘offensive’ and replaces it with a differentword which they eventually also decide is offensive—a process driven bycontinuous competition among themselves for the moral high ground. In changingthe language, we speak in an increasingly different way from people in the past,we are increasingly distanced from them. They and their ideas becomeincreasingly alien to us.[7] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-7]However, the ideology of ‘Progress’ can also be seen in the world-view of manyscientists. In the 19th century, their forebears developed so-called ‘stagetheories’ as part of a broader thought system known as ‘social evolutionism’.Societies, they argued, all passed through roughly the same stages: first, theybelieved in magic and many gods, then, as they progressed, they moved on tobelieving in just one God, and, finally, they rejected belief in God and becamescientific.[8] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-8] This progress couldpotentially continue forever and ever, as we progress so far that ‘sciencefiction’ becomes reality. This is best encapsulated in the idea known as the‘Singularity’, a term first coined by science fiction author Vernor Vinge in1993 to describe the impact on society of exponential or ‘runaway’ evolution ofcomputing power.[9] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-9] In his 2006 bookThe Singularity is Near, the American inventor Ray Kurzweil argues thataccording to this ‘law of accelerating returns’ there will be an exponentialincrease in technological advancement in multiple fields such that by about 2045we will reach the ‘Singularity’. This will be a turning point, whentechnological progress will be so rapid that it will outstrip the ability ofhumanity to comprehend it. Kurzweil predicts that these technological advanceswill irreversibly transform people. They will improve their minds and bodieswith genetic alterations, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. Once theSingularity has been reached, Kurzweil claims that machine intelligence will beincomprehensibly more powerful than all human intelligence put together.Intelligence will then radiate outward from the planet until it saturates theentire universe.[10] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-10]In many ways, this world-view is quite similar to the philosophy of the Frenchpriest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955), who was a very popular thinker inhis lifetime. He argued that evolution inevitably moved towards increasingcomplexity and therefore increasing consciousness and intelligence. Eventually,evolution would take us to an Omega Point of maximum complexity in which a kindof supreme consciousness and awareness would be reached.[11][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-11] Elements of this world-view can alsobe seen in the Christian belief in the return of Christ who will usher in theKingdom of God. For Church Father St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430), the worldmoves in a linear fashion from ‘creation’ to the return of Christ and the End ofDays. At that point, the elect will spend eternity in Heaven while everybodyelse will be damned to Hell.[12] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-12]However, there is a slight difference here in that we will merely recreate aperfect past in Heaven. Either way, all these world-views seem to understandhistory as being linear. It has an end point, which we either move towards ortry to return to."},{"pageContent":"CyclesThe third view is neither that our best days are necessarily behind us nor arethey ahead of us. There is neither constant progression towards perfection, norperfection in the past that we try to imitate as best we can. Civilisationsfollow cycles. They rise and fall. They reach a tipping point, they burnthemselves out, they collapse, but new civilisations will eventually rise oncemore.This world-view, of the cyclical nature of life, underpins manynon-Judeo-Christian religions; religions, which we might call ‘polytheist’. InHinduism, there is no end time, nor even a beginning. There are three main godswho manifest themselves in different stages of the universe. Universes come intoexistence as Brahma, they follow the life cycle of Vishnu, and they areultimately destroyed by Shiva, the goddess of destruction. Then Brahma breathesnew life into the universe and the process begins afresh. Universes rise andfall, and so do people. If they live their life according to Hindu rituals theywill be reincarnated as something higher; a member of a higher caste, perhaps.If they are a bad Hindu then they may be reincarnated as a dog. But they willalways be reincarnated as something, because the cycle of life is eternal. Werise, we fall, and we rise again.[13][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-13]Europe’s pre-Christian religions understood the world in very similar terms. Forthe Norse pagans, there was no real afterlife, in the sense of a state ofeternal bliss. Depending on how you had lived your life, you would make your wayto one of three worlds where you would simply carry on with your life much asyou had lived it in ‘Midgard’, the world of humans. These worlds are Valhalla,for warriors, Niflheim, for honourable non-warriors, and Hel, for those who arenot honourable. However, the world will culminate in Ragnärok, a huge flood andorgy of destruction in which many gods and most humans will be killed,effectively destroying the universe. But from these deadly waters, a newuniverse will arise and the cycle of life will start all over again.[14][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-14]Many Classical and Medieval writers observed that civilisations work in much thesame way, as even in Classical times there were records of civilisations havingalready risen and fallen. These writers were the precursors of what is known insociology as ‘Social Cycle Theory’. Put simply, social cycle theorists arguethat civilisations begin in a primitive Dark Age. They grow until they reach aGolden Age of science and technology but they will eventually go into decline,fall into another Dark Age and ultimately rise once more. This was essentiallygrounded in a religious view of the world, rather like the Norse one. Plato,Hesiod, and Aristotle all conceived of cycles of existence, a Golden Age, thecollapse of human order, and its subsequent revival, though this occurred, as inthe Norse case, in the form of the rise of a new universe. The Roman philosopherCicero (106–43 BC) understood the world to be influenced by the movements of theplanets. These moved in cycles, he argued, and life on Earth reflected this withits different ages, including the different ages of civilisations. Eventually,we would reach the ‘Great Year’ in which the planets returned to their originalpositions and the cycle began anew.However, it was the Greek philosopher Polybius (200–118 BC) who was the first toadvocate, albeit implicitly, a cyclical philosophy of the rise and fall ofcivilisations wherein there was no metaphysical dimension. Polybius was from thecity state of Megalopolis in Arcadia. The son of a senior politician, Polybiusrose to be highly influential in politics himself. In analysing the rises andfalls of dominant societies in the history of Rome and Greece, Polybius noticedthat the same pattern could be observed again and again. Societies rise whenthey are religious, have a deep reverence for the past and for oldergenerations, are prepared to engage in noble acts of self-sacrifice, and followclear moral rules. These qualities ensure that they have a sense of superiority,a sense of their own destiny, that they are a cohesive community, and that theycan be motivated to defend their society, even unto death. When they lose thesequalities—which they inevitably do—then they fall. People become too rich andwhen this happens they lose their ‘fear of the gods’ and with it theirselflessness and community spirit, their sense of eternal destiny, theirreverence for older generations, and the strict moral rules which bind themtogether. By the time Polybius was writing, he was of the view that Romansociety was itself in decline, as we will see in Chapter Eleven. Polybius alsonoticed that this process coincided with the same demographic decline that wehave witnessed in the second half of the 20th century in the West: people, andespecially the most intelligent people, simply stop having children.[15][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-15]Moving into the medieval period, we meet the Islamic scholar Ibn Khaldun(1332–1406). Ibn Khaldun was born into an aristocratic Andalusian family thathad emigrated to Tunisia after the fall of Seville to the Reconquista in 1248.He worked as an adviser or prime minister to various political leaders andestablished himself as a great philosopher. In 1400, he was caught up in thesiege of Damascus. The leader of the siege, Timur, was so keen to meet thefamous philosopher that Ibn Khaldun was lowered in a basket over the city walland spent seven weeks in Timur’s camp, lecturing him on the theory ofhistory.[16] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-16] Ibn Khaldun argued thatcentral to civilisation was the concept of ‘Asabiyyah’, which translates assomething like social cohesion or social solidarity. Asabiyyah will increase andreach a peak as civilisation advances but, ultimately, it will go into declineand, with it, the civilisation will go into decline and be displaced by anotherone in which Asabiyyah is stronger. It can be seen just how similar IbnKhaldun’s theory is to that of Polybius, though Ibn Khaldun directly spells itout.[17] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-17] For Ibn Khaldun, conditionsof something like group selection were strong among people who lived in thedeserts. This meant they could only survive if they were high in Asabiyyah andmanifestations of it such as religiousness and martial values. This highAsabiyyah allowed them to flourish and create cities. However, here theselection for Asabiyyah was lower because conditions were more luxurious. Assuch, after a number of generations Asabiyyah declined to an extent that theywould be invaded by desert tribes that were higher in Asabiyyah and the cyclewould begin all over again.[18] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-18]"},{"pageContent":"Modern Social Cycle TheoriesThe first prominent ‘modern’ advocate of this theory was the Italian historianGiambattista Vico (1668–1744). The son of a bookseller, he originally worked asa private tutor, but rose to become Professor of Rhetoric at the University ofNaples and was the official historiographer to the king. Vico argued that statespass through three stages: the Age of Gods, the Age of Heroes, and the Age ofMen. After the Age of Men, society collapses back into the Age of Gods and thecycle occurs all over again in the form of recurrence which is similar, thoughnot identical to, the previous cycle. From his historical analysis, thereappears to be some kind of upward spiral, with the successor cycle reaching ahigher level of complexity than the previous one, but this is merely based onhis observance of two cycles.For Vico, the three ages of the cycle clearly took place in Ancient Greece andRome. They began as simple, savage societies whose anxieties were allayed by thegods, whom they also feared. A simple aristocracy ruled over these societies andcontrolled them through religion or, as Vico terms it, ‘poetic wisdom’. However,this aristocracy was not highly distinct from those whom it ruled. From this,they developed into more complex societies where there was a much clearer dividebetween the ‘nobility’ (the heroes) and the ‘plebeians’, who fought to gain someof the privileges held by the nobility but were ruled by them. So, society hasbecome less united. In the Age of Heroes, there is a conspicuous and highlydistinct ruling class whose members battle with each other for control and toshow their strength. In the Age of Men, the heroes cede some of their power tothe plebeians. In the previous ages, humanity was ruled by religion and ritualand this upheld the power of the nobility. The plebeians advance their owninterests, and undermine the power of the nobility, by advocating a rational wayof thinking. This empowers the plebeians but also undermines religion and, in sodoing, shatters cultural unity. Religiousness inspires people to work for thecommon good but now they focus only on the individual. Society splinters into‘the barbarism of reflection’ in which civil wars are fought solely for personalgain. It duly collapses back to the Age of Gods. Vico argued that this can beseen in the Fall of Rome, as we will see in Chapter Eleven. In the Dark Ages, wethen have a new ‘Age of Gods’. Medieval Europe is the Age of Heroes and theRenaissance can be understood as the beginning of the Age of Men, in whichsociety reaches an intellectual, cultural, and technological peak which is alsoits own undoing.[19] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-19]A number of scholars since Vico have explicitly analysed society in terms ofcycles. Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), a German philosopher, produced thetwo-volume The Decline of the West in 1918.[20][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-20] Spengler was a morose and depressivecharacter. The son of a postal clerk, he attended several universities, andeventually focused on philosophy, but then failed his doctoral thesis—on theGreek philosopher Heraclitus—in 1903. This humiliation essentially ended hischances of an academic career. Spengler passed his PhD exam in 1904, wroteanother thesis so he could qualify as a school-teacher, and then had a nervousbreakdown in 1905. He worked as a school-teacher until 1911 when his motherdied, leaving him independently wealthy. Avoiding military service due to aheart defect, he spent the rest of his life as a writer. He met Hitler and wasso unimpressed that, in 1934, he published the best-selling book The Hour ofDecision.[21] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-21] Being critical ofNational Socialism, it was duly banned. Spengler died of a heart attack shortlybefore his 56th birthday.[22] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-22]Comparing societies to organisms, Spengler argued that all societies that haveever existed—though they may differ markedly in specifics—go through the samefairly clear stages that organisms do: birth, youth, maturity, decline, anddeath. In its spring, the society is characterised by a ‘culture’ which is basedaround a strong sense of religiousness. This bears fruit in its summer, in whichwe then see the height of its creative achievements: its epics, its poems, itsplays; all of them religiously inspired to some extent. The culture is vital,optimistic, and does not question its own destiny. However, as it matures intothe autumn of its years, it becomes urbanised and wealthy. There appears aSocrates or a Rousseau who questions everything and we enter an age ofrationalism in which technological progress goes hand-in-hand with scepticismabout religion, aristocratic rule, tradition, and everything that has heldsociety together. At first this generates optimism about a better future, inwhich standards of living are much improved. Indeed, the society is so certainof the utility of its rational way of thinking that it motivates empire-buildingand the spread of its way of thinking, often via a political figure: Caesar,Napoleon, or Cecil Rhodes. But, on the other hand, there is a decline inreligious certainty, with everything focused around material wealth.This process of rationalisation continues, and every idea is questioned, theneverything is rationalised down to money (even having children), all of the oldways are despised, and there is no longer any optimism or soul holding societytogether. Society is strongly individualist and we enter the winter ofcivilisation. The constant critique, and artificial attempt to create meaning,leads to a nihilistic, pessimistic world and a gulf between the money-focusedelite and the masses, because there is no longer any religious belief that theposition of the elite is somehow deserved. Society becomes fragmented, democracyand order break down and demagogues take over, leading an increasingly alienatedmass. This is the Age of Emperors. These Emperors are given extraordinary powersto sort out the mess of conflict that society has degenerated into, includingproblems of external invaders. The despair which people feel is lifted by vaguereligious yearnings. They engage in religious practices of various kinds butdon’t really believe them. But as society becomes yet more chaotic we see thedevelopment of a ‘Second Religiousness’, which is an anti-intellectual andrehashed version of the religion on which the society was founded. So, in Rome,argues Spengler, we see the rise of the Cult of the Emperor and, in particular,the Mystery Cults, where members were initiated into secret practices andworshipped specific gods. The Emperor Julian the Apostate (r.361–363), whoattempted to re-convert Christian Rome back to paganism, was an initiate of theCult of Mithras, for example.[23] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-23]Spengler insists that, when he was writing, the West’s Second Religiousnessremained a number of generations into the future. During this period, societybecomes so badly weakened that it is often taken over by societies which aremore youthful, and descends back into a Dark Age, to be reborn anew.[24][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-24]Many other historical theorists have presented models to understand the rise andfall of civilisations. An entire volume could be written on this subject alone.For example, the British historian Arnold Toynbee (1889–1975) observes thatcivilisation is based around an increasing ability to solve problems and it isthose who are most able to do this who become the society’s ‘elite’ or, as heterms it, society’s ‘creative minority’. Eventually, their ability to solve newproblems stagnates and they stay in power not because they deserve it, but byforce, in a declining society. This leads to a resentful internal proletariatand an equally resentful external one in less wealthy border societies, both ofwhom are poor and excluded. Eventually, they rise up and take over, and thesociety collapses.[25] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-25]A variation of these models can be seen in the work of the English vicar ThomasMalthus (1766–1834). In his book An Essay on the Principle of Population,Malthus proffered a beautifully simple cyclical theory of how the growth andcontraction of a society operates.[26][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-26] When there is an abundance ofresources and a small population the standard of living is relatively high,because there is more than enough land and food to sustain the population.Precisely because conditions are auspicious, the population will grow andeventually it will reach the maximum possible population that the ecology canrealistically sustain. However, this will also mean that living standards formost of the population will have declined and, in addition, the situation willbe highly unstable. It will take little more than a few bad harvests or a periodof pestilence to cause a population collapse. Once this happens the cycle simplybegins all over again. This has obvious implications for the development ofcivilisation.The application of Malthusian theory to more general social cycle theories is animportant nuance. Just as a social cycle theory argues that history is not asimple progression towards perfection characterised by constant improvement, thesame can be said of cycles of civilisation. Looking at the life cycle of anycivilisation, though we may note a general progression towards the summer ofcivilisation followed by a decline, it will not be entirely smooth. There willbe cycles even within this process; periods in which civilisation goes backwardswithin a broader progression or forwards within a wider decline. FollowingSpengler’s seasonal metaphor, we might conceive of these as rainy days in summeror warm days in winter. The period surrounding the World Wars, for example,might be conceived of as some wintry days in autumn. They are entirely congruouswith the innovation rate graph we have already examined whereby per capitaeminent individuals increase between 1600 and 1825 and then go into decline.This is the overall pattern, but there are many ‘humps and bumps’ within this.In fact, these regressions are generally explicable in terms of wars andfamines, which would be congruous with the Malthusian model.The progress towards and regress away from the heights of civilisation is notlinear but oscillates due to economic factors and religious factors, amongothers. However, at some points, society falls so far from the heights ofcivilisation that we can talk about it having collapsed. It’s also worth notingthat the history of any cycle of civilisation seems to involve a number ofintense periods of intellectual curiosity, and it could be plausibly argued thatthey are actually caused by the chaos that precedes them. Sergey Nefedov hasidentified eight Malthusian cycles in the history of Europe. (1) The Republic ofRome; (2) The Early Roman Empire; (3) The Christian Empire, ended by theBarbarian invasions; (4) The Dark Ages and the Middle Ages, ended by the BlackDeath; (5) The first cycle of the Modern Age, ended by the English Civil War;(6) The second cycle of the Modern Age, ended by the French Revolution andNapoleonic Wars; (7) The Industrial Age, which seems to have broken theMalthusian cycle.[27] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-27]An example of this can be seen in the Black Death in Europe. By the late 1340s,the European population had become unsustainably high, leading to famine and soit became a weakened population. When the plague hit, therefore, it wasunleashed on people who already suffered from weakened immunity. This made itfar more catastrophic than other outbreaks of plague and it killed around athird of the European population. However, it wouldn’t have been a random third.It disproportionately impacted the poor. In some areas of England, up to 80% ofthe labouring class was killed.[28] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-28]They were more likely to be killed because their poor living conditions and poorhealth made it much more likely that they would catch and die of plague. Theywould also, on average, have lower g than the higher classes, meaning they wouldbe less forward-thinking and so less likely to follow strategies that would helpthem avoid catching the plague, such as avoiding people that seemed to have it.As such, we would expect that the Black Death would have increased the averageIQ of Medieval Europe quite dramatically. The Black Death was followed by aperiod of depression and war, which would likewise have heavily affected thepoor, which ended towards the end of the 15th century. It is likely nocoincidence, therefore, that the Renaissance, a marked period of intellectualcuriosity, began in earnest around one hundred years after the Black Death.Furthermore, with a much-reduced population, living standards significantlyincreased; further aiding intellectual development. The end of this period,around the middle to late 17th century, was also marked by plague and famine andit may be that this assisted the development of the Enlightenment and theIndustrial Revolution by, once more, boosting European g in a relatively suddenway."},{"pageContent":"Cutting Through it All with General IntelligenceThese theories are all extremely thought-provoking and are the products of someof humanity’s greatest and most pensive minds. But they raise a very simplequestion: what is underpinning the whole process? The essence of science is‘reductionism’—trying to get down to the simplest possible root cause of things;striving to achieve a theory of everything. What is it that is behind the way inwhich civilisations appear to rise and fall, flower and decay?Whatever answer we suggest, there will be those who will accuse us ofover-simplifying things, who will nit-pick the validity of the model by notingthat it doesn’t work precisely with some obscure civilisation or other; ordemand that we respond to an infinite regress of very unlikely possiblealternative explanations before we can possibly have any confidence in our case.Our response to those people is that this is real life and real life doesn’twork like this. If someone told you not to get out of your car in the WoburnAbbey Safari Park lion enclosure in Bedfordshire because the lions will probablykill you, we would suggest that is a very good piece of advice based onempirical evidence regarding how lions behave. Of course, if you wanted, youcould assert that it was simplistic to argue that all lions are dangerous. Youcould highlight some outlier example of a really friendly lion that lickschildren and befriends kittens. You could demand that we prove that all peoplewho have previously been killed by lions didn’t in fact coincidentally die ofsomething else in the presence of the lion. Or you could ask, with greatprofundity, ‘But, what do you mean by “lion”?’ and refuse to accept the argumentuntil ‘lion’ is perfectly defined, which, obviously, no category can be becausethey all involve drawing artificial borders; breaking up reality into manageablechunks that allow us to make successful predictions. If you followed thesepseudo-intellectual strategies at the Safari Park in Bedfordshire, you wouldalmost certainly be killed by a lion. As such, they fail the philosophical testof pragmatism, a test proposed by the American philosopher William James(1842–1910).[29] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-29] Pragmatism arguesthat theories are tools to better understand, and find our way through, theworld. Following the kind of arguments we have highlighted would simply lead todeath, because no decisions could ever be made. They are intellectual posing andshould be dismissed out of hand.So, having despatched such arguments, what is the fundamental factor behind thegrowth and shrinkage of great societies throughout history? We would argue thatthe fundamental issue, as Ronald Fisher earlier argued, is ‘intelligence’, ormore specifically ‘g’. Put simply, in their early stages civilisations haverelatively low g and are extremely unstable and dangerous places to live. Peopleare under extreme conditions of group selection. For this reason, they arehighly religious, as religiousness is associated with stress.[30][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-30] Religiousness has been shown to beweakly negatively associated with g in many different societies among populationsamples.[31] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-31] It is also positivelyassociated with positive ethnocentrism (the belief that your society is superiorand a desire to make sacrifices for your society) and negative ethnocentrism(the belief that other societies are inferior).[32][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-32]As already noted, research with computer models has shown that the moreethnocentric a society is, the more internally cooperative it will be. Allthings being equal, a more ethnocentric society will always predominate over aless ethnocentric one, according to computer models. In these models, you set upa grid with different coloured dots, which reproduce asexually at certainintervals. If you ‘cooperate’ when you are next to another dot, you damageyourself slightly but you aid the other dot. There are four kinds of dot or‘agent’: humanitarians (they always cooperate), selfish (they never cooperate),ethnocentrics (they only cooperate with their own colour), and traitors (theyonly cooperate with other colours). Eventually, after a number of generations,the ethnocentrics dominate the grid.[33][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-33] This means, and this is a point thatwill become very important later, religion can be understood as a matter ofgroup selection. When two roughly similar groups are in conflict, because theyare expanding, there will be group selection for religiousness. The morereligious group under these conditions will triumph.As such, in the early stages of civilisation there is individual level selectionfor g and a kind of selection—at the group level and even the individuallevel—for religiousness. Society has a sense of divine purpose, is stronglyunited, it is under intense selection pressure, and it is becoming ever moreintelligent, as only the richest pass on their genes. Assuming the selectionintensity for g is strong enough, the society will develop into acivilisation—of great intellectual ability—and become highly urbanised. However,this will also be its undoing. In effect, it will become ‘too intelligent’ andthis will lead to the civilisation’s collapse.Religiousness has been shown to be associated with stress, as we have alreadynoted. People become more religious at times of stress, religious experiencestend to occur at times of stress, and those who are high in Neuroticism—meaningthey suffer strongly from stress—are prone to periods of religiousness.[34][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-34] Religiousness is about 40%heritable, so it seems to be an evolved disposition, one of the purposes ofwhich is to help us cope with stress.[35][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-35] With a very high level of average g,society will create an environment that is so low in stress—at least for thebetter off—that they will become less religious, something which will also occurdue to their very high level of g.This will have further consequences. Stress is also likely to engenderfertility, as producing lots of children hedges against the fact that relativelyfew may survive—thus with the relaxation of environmental and social stress,fewer children need to be produced. Simply put, knowing that they don’t need alarge family to guarantee the survival of their children, intelligent peoplewill only have a small family. Also, their high g and interest in intellectualpursuits may mean that they manage to rationalise having no children at all. Bycontrast, those with lower g, who are relatively more impulsive, will have highfertility, by accident. In previous times, these accidental offspring would havelikely died young. But in a society with better living conditions and bettermedical knowledge, this will be less likely to happen. In addition, as thestandard of living increases, stress levels will be reduced and people willbecome more altruistic and caring towards the less fortunate in society and willbe wealthy enough to sustain them with a system of welfare. These processes willremove checks on the fertility of the poor and thus on those lower in g. It willreduce the strength of selection favouring higher g."},{"pageContent":"Virtue Signalling and EqualityAt the same time, members of this comfortable elite will compete forintellectual or moral status with other members of the elite by critiquing thesociety’s religious traditions and attempting to display their altruism, a pointmade by the German psychologist Volkmar Weiss.[36][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-36] The rise of social media has broughtthe subject of competition for moral and intellectual status into stark relief.Whenever there is a tragedy, such as the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015,Facebook will soon be awash with slogans such as ‘Pray for Paris’ or peoplealtering their profile picture so that the background is the French flag. Suchbehaviour, of course, in no way helps to fight terrorism or assist those who areaffected by it. It is simply a form of virtue signalling; a way of indicating tothe community that you are a kind person, kindness being a socially and sexuallyvalued quality. The effect of this, however, is to create an arms race ofcompetitive altruism and this can be seen in the changes in focus of thepolitical left in England since the 1940s.In the 1940s, the focus of the left was the condition of the working class. Thiswas at a point at which there were still influential people who were opposed toconcepts such as the National Health Service, high levels of unemploymentbenefit, redistributive taxation, and similar ideas. Once everybody, in publicat least, pretty much accepted these ideas then status could no longer beaccrued by advocating them. So, a competition developed to continuously increaselevels of unemployment benefit and also to move the focus onto the issues ofracism and sexism. People began to signal their superior virtue by stressing hownon-racist they were. This led to a new anti-racism arms race until almostnobody would openly admit to being racist by the 1990s. And so while this armsrace continues, a new one began with regard to sexual orientation and signallingyour virtue by stressing how much you want to help those of a non-traditionalsexual orientation. This arms race has led to innovations that would have beenunthinkable twenty years earlier, such as gay marriage and unisex publictoilets.But another arms race occurs at the same time. We might term this an‘intellectual’ arms race. The elite compete with one another to signal theirhigh g and originality. They do this by questioning and critiquing all aspectsof tradition. There is a strong focus on questioning religious tradition butthis can extend to questioning all traditional norms, including the socialhierarchy, sex roles, traditional models of sexuality, and so forth. Again, thiscreates an arms race of ever more extreme views which eventually become thenorm.This will have the effect of undermining the basis of the traditional hierarchyand permitting the rise of new forms of religion, which help to promote thosewho are not part of the elite. And they will then promote ideologies basedaround equality, as these will be in their interests. This will contribute to anatmosphere in which all people must be considered equal. This being the case, itwill be difficult and even dangerous to attempt to advocate a policy which wouldreverse the process of g decline, a point also made by Volkmar Weiss.[37][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-37] Policies of this kind simply couldnot be instituted in a democracy. Weiss also observes that democracy andsocialism are obvious examples of these equality-based ideologies. They bothtreat all people as equal (either in absolute terms, or in terms of theircapacity to jointly contribute to the commonweal via political participation)and, in the case of socialism, transfer resources from those with higher g tothose with lower levels, aiding the genetic interests of those with lower g.And this will be potentiated by the decline of religion. When you control forsocial class, religiousness is a significant predictor of fertility: the morereligious you are, the bigger your family is likely to be. This may be becausemany religions teach that children are a blessing from God and you should haveas many as possible. But, as the elite become more intelligent, less stressed,and less religious, their fertility is likely to be impacted for this reason.There’s no God who demands they ‘go forth and multiply’, so why bother? Why notjust ‘drink, eat and be merry, for tomorrow we shall die’? By having a smallnumber of—or even no—children, such people help to preserve a relatively highstandard of living, but it is at the expense of their genetic interests. Thiscompounds the g decline and also leads to a society—and particularly itselite—that is low in ethnocentrism and is nihilistic. These views will spreaddown the society as the elite tends to be imitated in a process known as‘trickle effect’,[38] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-38] highlighted bythe German sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918). Also, people lower and lowerdown the society will be less and less stressed.As g declines, society will stop working as well, levels of crime will increase,levels of trust will collapse, and democracy will be debased. We have alreadyobserved the way in which, as societies develop, social differences become morepronounced. Indeed, the French economist Thomas Piketty has shown—using 250years of French tax records—that wealth inequality increases as economic growthincreases.[39] [part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-39] So, because noreligious certainty sanctifies the position of the (ever more elite) elite, theywill find themselves challenged by organised members of the proletariatadvocating ideologies of equality. As these grow in power, the decline in g willbecome even more pronounced as resources are transferred from the rich to thepoor, encouraging the latter to be more fertile. As such, an internalproletariat or external proletariat will be able to take over, and we will nowbe in the winter of civilisation. As the society lacks the unifying force ofreligiousness, it will be easy for Ibn Khaldun’s ‘desert tribesmen’ to invadethe society. The society will stop innovating and will eventually start to gobackwards, becoming less rational and more religious as levels of stress beginto increase. This is likely to continue until it returns to pre-modern levels ofselection for g. From this it will—in some form—rise from the ashes. In otherwords, the society will continue to decay until conditions are so harsh thatselection for g and religiousness are re-established and then, as Ibn Khaldunargues, the cycle will begin all over again.Even the Malthusian model—which is in theory entirely environmental—would beless question-begging if g were a dimension of it. As Volkmar Weiss has noted,under Malthusian conditions, intelligence is positively associated withfertility and, thus, continuously selected for. However, this eventually leadsto an Industrial Revolution in which the pace of development—and the rise inliving standards—outpaces population growth. As such, the Malthusian cycle—of aperiod of wealth leading to an unsustainably high population and thus apopulation collapse—is broken. The population climbs and climbs and g is nolonger being selected for. Indeed, with the rise of reliable contraception andvery high living standards, selection for g goes into reverse. Eventually, dueto the resultant decline, society will run out of ways to sustain its risingpopulation. Indeed, this would be reflected in declining per capita majorinnovation rates, which we have already discussed. The population will lose itsability to master systems that were comprehensible when societal g was higher.This will lead to a population collapse, uprisings, and a decline ofcivilisation. In addition, we can add that the decline of religion—caused partlyby the society’s high standard of living—would mean the elite were no longerunited or motivated, making a revolution more likely to succeed. However, it isquite likely that the higher g members of the population—who would be wealthierand more far-sighted—would be more likely to survive this societal collapse.Thus, the collapse of civilisation would boost the g of the remnant population,such that the cycle of development could begin anew."},{"pageContent":"Climate ChangeHowever, there is another model of the collapse of populations which may alsocontribute to understanding these cycles. It has been proposed that the keyculprit may in fact be climate change.[40][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-40] Cold temperatures are known to makepopulations more violent. This makes sense, as crops are more likely to failwhen the weather is inclement, thus starving populations will seek to expand inorder to secure resources. It has been noted that temperatures were considerablylower in Early Modern Era Europe than they are today. This was due to the LittleIce Age, which corresponded with a period of very low sunspot activity calledthe ‘Maunder Minimum’. Research has shown that cold correlates with warfare andinter-group violence—the Little Ice Age corresponding with a series of extremelyviolent conflicts in Europe called the General Crisis of the 17th Century.[41][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-41] Recall that this was a period ofextremely high mortality, especially among the poor, and also downward socialmobility (as described by Gregory Clark, whom we met earlier). So, if the coldand hunger didn’t kill you, violence or disease would, hence the cold, bothdirectly and indirectly, promoted the fitness of those with high g. Recall alsothat geniuses were increasing in prevalence during this time period. Again, thiswould be consistent with the presence of inter-group conflict and groupselection—the geniuses being most numerous in the biggest, smartest, and mostsuccessful groups.During this time period, the most successful populations (such as the British)were establishing empires. These caused massive additional population growth tooccur. By the start of the Late Modern Era in the mid-18th century, globaltemperatures had started to increase, however. The ecological stress on thepopulations of Europe would have started to reduce. Fewer people died ofexposure or hunger. Populations became more peaceful as well, with conflictdropping to very low levels after the Napoleonic Wars in a period called PaxBrittanica—literally the ‘British Peace’.[42][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-42] This was a time period in which thefruits of genius were making life more tolerable for everyone. There wereinnovations in hygiene, medicine, and labour saving technologies. These boostedeconomic efficiency and led to social innovations, such as the first seriouswelfare economy having first been introduced in Germany in the 1870s.[43][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-43] Less distressed and betterlooked-after but ultimately pacified populations fell into the regime ofindividual-level selection favouring those with low IQs, which becameexacerbated as it became easier for high-IQ individuals to better control theirfertility.In a more recently published monograph, a team of psychologists tested thisempirically using 400 years of temperature means, an index of group selectionstrength (which was comprised of converging measures of per capita warfatalities, the frequency of altruism words across texts, and the proportion ofAnglo-derived people to the rest of the world’s population), and the utilisationfrequencies of the four high-difficulty WORDSUM words tracked using Google NgramViewer, graphed in Figure 7. It was found, consistent with predictions, that theincrease in global temperature negatively predicted the intensity of groupselection, which in turn positively predicted the level of g. So as the climatewarmed, group selection declines, which in turn reduces the level of g.[44][part0013_split_007.html#footnote-94621-44]Basically, we can understand the rise and fall of civilisation in terms of anumber of interrelated models which are ultimately underpinned by g.

He wrote TheHistories, many centuries before the Fall of Rome, which is conventionally putat the year 410, when the city was invaded by Germanic hoards. When Isaac Newton(1643–1727) attended school in the mid-17th century, Roman culture wasconsidered to be so important and unsurpassable that his school taught Latin andpretty much nothing else. This is no longer the case in English schools. Thoughmost pupils are taught about the Roman Empire at school, history classes are farmore likely to focus on ‘modern history’ and, in particular, the history of the20th century. So, before we look into the quite uncanny parallels between Romancivilisation and its successor, it would be handy to quickly recap the historyof Rome.[1] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-1]Rome was established in the 9th century BC and was originally ruled byhereditary kings. It developed a polytheistic religion, in many ways comparableto modern day Hinduism. The emphasis was on blood bonds and ritual rather thanbelief, and religious practices varied substantially by Italian region. TheRepublic of Rome was set up in 509 BC and by the 3rd century BC Rome dominatedthe entire Italian peninsula. By this time around 310,000 people lived in Romeitself. The nature of Roman government, from around 509 BC, was of a senatecomposed of members of the Roman nobility—the ‘patricians’. In addition, therewere elected popular assemblies and annually elected magistrates, which meantthere was civic participation from the city’s freeborn non-noble men: the‘plebeians’. Beneath these were the slaves. They were, however, granted variousfreedoms, could be highly educated and influential, and could sometimes earnenough to buy their freedom.By the last century BC, however, Rome had developed into an empire and wasbereft by conflicts. Non-Roman freemen within Italy fought for the same rightsas Romans. There were wars between Rome and its allies, who had fought for Romeand were angry that they were not sufficiently rewarded. There were also aseries of slave revolts, motivated by the slaves not being treated properly orbeing impoverished. Italy was seriously threatened by bands of escaped slaves,led by Spartacus (c.111–71 BC), between 73–71 BC, who looted the countryside.The semi-democratic Republic was simply unable to solve these problems and itcollapsed into military dictatorship under Julius Caesar (100–44 BC). With hisassassination, Rome moved towards autocracy and by 44 BC it was now an imperium,under the Emperor Augustus. However, it was not a strictly hereditary imperium,in the sense of the crown passing to the eldest son. New emperors would bedeclared by the senate or installed by the Praetorian Guard; the emperor’sbody-guards. This dictatorship was, therefore, highly unstable and wascharacterised by civil war, autocratic leaders, rebellions, coups, and a numberof emperors being assassinated, such as Caligula and Commodus. From 235, when anemperor was again assassinated, there were 26 emperors over a 50-year period.Eventually, the Empire began to become Christian with the conversion of theEmperor Constantine (sole ruler 324–337). Further rebellion meant it was splitin two, with the centre of power moving to Byzantium. By this time, Rome’spopulation was well down from its peak of around a million. By 410, thecity—corrupt and plagued by internal strife—was sacked by Germanic tribes fromwithin the Empire. In 480, the last Roman Emperor (in Rome) was murdered andreplaced by a barbarian general. The population of Rome decreased to about100,000. Rome’s population simply pillaged or recycled its cultural artefacts, aprocess of vandalism that continued until the Renaissance."},{"pageContent":"Rome and General IntelligenceThe above is undoubtedly a simplified summary of the rise and fall of Rome. Buteven such a brief summary strongly hints at the place of g in the process ofRome’s rise and fall. Of course, there are numerous theorists who have attemptedto explain the decline of the Empire. However, many of these are simplydescriptions. The British historian Edward Gibbon (1737–1794) famously wrote:‘The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangersand mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwardsviolated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personalsafety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corruptingthe discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and tothe enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finallydissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world wasoverwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.’[2][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-2]This in no way explains why these processes occurred and leads us to ask whyRome degenerated into dictatorship, particularly when democracy is predicted byhigh g. More recently, the historian Ramsey MacMullen has argued that risingcorruption was the reason for the collapse of Rome.[3][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-3] But why was there rising corruption?As we have seen, corruption is predicted by low g. Yet another idea is that leadpoisoning was behind the process.[4] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-4]The upper class were more likely to have drunk water from (lead) pipes and beenpoisoned by it. This, of course, seems to imply that g may have been relevant tothe fall of Rome. However, critics have shown that the level of lead in thepipes simply wouldn’t have been sufficient to poison people.[5][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-5] We would suggest that the simplestexplanation, which accounts for the descriptions we have looked at above, wasdeclining g and specifically in relation to low fertility among those withhigher g in the Roman Empire. Let us explore this explanation.In the beginning, as Rome began to develop, it was a monarchy and we wouldn’texpect its average g to be particularly high. But Rome would have been under thesame conditions of pre-industrial selection that we observed were the case inEarly Modern Europe. So, we can reasonably expect that there would be selectionfor g, with the result that this would be increasing every generation. By around400 BC, we see evidence that average g is likely to be relatively high. We havealready seen that g is associated with certain forms of behaviour and attitudes;in particular cooperation, civic participation, support for democracy, highlevels of trust, and the ability to solve social problems. All of thesecharacteristics would appear to be reflected in the form of governmentmaintained by the Roman Republic by this time. General intelligence is alsoassociated with, really, any ability to deal with complexity, so we also seeincreasingly complex buildings and forms of art. Living standards would be muchhigher, in general, than they had been in the past, especially among the Romanelite.As the process of increasing g and consequent increasing living standardscontinues, we start to see a rather interesting development, which has been setout by Gerhard Meisenberg in his book In God’s Image.[6][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-6] Those who are part of the elite, andwhom we would therefore expect, on average, to be among those with the highestg, seem to begin to limit their fertility. This could be seen in Greece, thenpart of the Roman Empire, during the time of Polybius—that is, the 2nd centuryBC. Polybius famously wrote that:‘In our own time, the whole of Greece has been subject to a low birth rate and ageneral decrease of population, owing to which cities have become deserted andland has ceased to yield fruit although there have neither been continuous warsor epidemics... For men have fallen into such a state of pretentiousness,avarice, and indolence that they did not wish to marry, or if they married torear the children born to them or at most, as a rule, have one or two of them.’Now, obviously, this is highly impressionistic—Polybius doesn’t present us withhard data—and he is merely a source with his own motivations and should betreated as such. The above quote is likely to be mainly referring to the kindsof Greeks with which Polybius was intimately acquainted—members of the elite,rather than Greeks in general—or the population collapse would have beenincredibly rapid. But, even with those reservations, the implication is thatmembers of the Greek upper class, who are experiencing a very high standard ofliving, are choosing to have only small numbers of children and, in some cases,no children at all. This observation would quite precisely parallel what hasbeen observed in modern times. Among elite Greeks g had risen to the point thatthey were able to rationalise whether or not to have children. In that they werewealthy, their child mortality rate would have been relatively low, so it wouldhave made sense to have only a small number of children, confident that they’dprobably survive into adulthood. And these children could then enjoy a highstandard of living, each with a larger share of the family money invested inthem than they’d otherwise receive. The Ancient Greeks used various forms ofcontraception, those with higher g would have been more efficient users ofcontraception, and so we would be left in a situation where, in the 2nd centuryBC in Greece and very probably in Rome also, there was relatively low fertilityamong those with the highest g.Certainly, two centuries later this was recorded as being the case in Romeitself. Two centuries after Polybius was writing, during the reign of theEmperor Augustus, it was commonly understood that members of the Romanaristocracy simply weren’t having many children. The poet Ovid recorded thischange at the time in his poem Nux:‘But since more plenteous honour has come to planes that yield a sterile shade,than to any tree, we fruit-bearers also (if as a nut tree I am counted amongthem) have begun to luxuriate in spreading foliage. Now apples grow not everyyear, and injured grapes and injured berries are brought home: now she thatwould seem beautiful harms her womb, and rare in these days is she who would bea parent.’[7] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-7]There were even attempts by the Roman authorities to incentivise the upperclasses to have more children, notes Meisenberg, but they simply didn’t work.With access to contraception, the Roman elite were able to limit their fertilitywhile still enjoying sex. This was not really possible for the Early Modernelite because the knowledge of contraception had been lost in the Dark Ages, butit was possible for the Roman elite and, to some extent, it would likely havepermeated further down the society. The result was quite predictable: in theabsence of modern medicine to check the mortality rate, the population woulddecrease in general, which it certainly did. The population of Italy fell fromabout 7.4 million in the age of Augustus to a mere 2.4 million by 600 AD. Inaddition, clearly, the population would have lost g, as, in each generation, thehigher-g members of the society failed to reproduce, or failed to reproduce insufficient numbers.It is likely that an important dimension of this fertility decline is thedecline of religion. As we have seen, religiousness—in the sense of believing inand worshipping supernatural powers—is weakly negatively associated with g. As gincreases, people, therefore, tend to become less religious. This can even beseen across the human lifespan, as g rises throughout childhood and adulthood toa peak in middle age, and, thereafter, cognitive decline sets in. Very youngchildren tend to adhere to fairytale beliefs, in which almost everything can beexplained by some kind of supernatural agency. Hence, they are happy to believein Father Christmas, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy. Older children, agedaround 9, tend not to hold these beliefs, but they almost all believe in God.They tend to start questioning this belief when they are teenagers and, bymiddle age, atheism is at a peak. In much the same way, we would expectreligiousness to go into decline as the society’s level of g rises. Anotherdimension of religiousness, as we have seen, is stress. Those who are low instress are generally less religious.[8][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-8]This being the case, we shouldn’t be surprised that the middle era of the RomanEmpire, in which it was at its height, sees the questioning of traditionalreligious values by members of the Roman upper class. A level of g and ofmaterial comfort has been reached whereby those who are highest in g and areconsequently the most materially comfortable are in a psychological positionwhere they are able to do this. Also, as we have discussed, they can gainsocioeconomic status from displaying their g via signalling their altruism,pushing for a new religion based around equality. We see, in a way that hadalready occurred in Ancient Greece, the rise of secular philosophies, which wereoriginally developed in Ancient Greece, such as Stoicism, which are highlyquestioning of traditional religion. Accordingly, some people begin toconsciously renounce worldly ideals, just as already happened in Greece. Ineffect, argues Meisenberg, a growing group of—mainly elite —people have takencontrol of their lives. They no longer believe, for example, that whether or notthey end up with a large family is simply in the hands of the gods. And to theextent that traditional religion might encourage fertility, they don’t reallycare. As such, the rise in g would be likely to go hand-in-hand with a declinein religiousness. This would compound the decline in fertility among those withthe highest g in the Roman world. In the absence of the massive Flynn Effect,set off by the Industrial Revolution, these factors would be sufficient to bringon a collapse in civilisation within a few centuries, and this is precisely whathappened. As already noted, by the time of Julius Caesar, Rome has degeneratedinto chaos and, as Spengler would predict, the response to this is the collapseof democracy, Caesarism, and Rome’s Second Religion.At around the same time, however, we see the rise of Christianity in the RomanEmpire. This begins as a religion of the poor and dispossessed and, therefore,those who are likely to have relatively low g. Following Ibn Khaldun, it is thereligion of Rome’s desert tribesmen and it is quickly able to spread to its owndispossessed people. As the g of Roman society declined, society becameincreasingly stressful to live in, and even the Second Religion became debased,Christianity began to make its way through Roman society. The Roman historianTacitus (56–120) noted that the Jews held contraception to be taboo andChristians inherited this taboo relating to contraception. Accordingly, we canreasonably assume that the fertility of the Roman lower classes, which wouldalready have been relatively high compared to that of the upper classes, wouldhave been further increased by the rise of Christianity. This would have helpedto further reduce the average g of the Roman people. In this regard, Meisenberghas done some rough calculations of the impact. He writes:‘Let’s assume that during the 14 generations from A.D. 50 to A.D. 400,Christians raised on average 20% more children than their pagan compatriotsbecause of these religious injunctions. Without any conversions at all thiswould have raised the percentage of Christians in the Roman Empire 10 fold,from, say, 2% to 20%. This is almost enough to explain the rise of earlyChristianity.’[9] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-9]This process, as we have already discussed, would have been rendered even morepronounced by the Christian emphasis on not being ‘worldly’, which encouragedmonasticism and renunciation of sex. Thus, Christians who were both high in gand highly religious would be discouraged from having any children, furtherreducing the average g of the population. In addition, Christian Rome bannedabortion and exposure of unwanted infants, which would normally have beenpractised by those of low g. This would have further helped to decrease the g ofthe population. Following Ibn Khaldun, Rome’s g and religiousness were loweredby weakened group selection. This was because Rome was declining rather thanexpanding as it was no longer competing as strongly with other groups. Inaddition, as we have seen, religiousness can be understood as being a groupselection phenomenon. Accordingly, not only would levels of Roman genius havebeen reduced but it would also have lacked sufficient ethnocentrism andsolidarity, being religiously split. It was duly invaded by barbarians, its veryown desert tribesmen.So, in Ancient Rome, we can see a process that neatly fits with the social cyclemodel of the rise and fall of civilisations. In essence, the society’s level ofg became too high, the people too comfortable and, although it seems callous,really rather too kind for their own good. All of this coalesced into a declinein g, as the higher-g portion of society lowered its fertility, leading to fewerpeople, as a percentage of the population, who could maintain the mechanics ofthe civilisation. As g declined, society started to become religious, but, atfirst, this form of religion would have reduced the society’s average g evenfurther. As a religion of the poor, it was based around promoting equality andwas, therefore, low in ethnocentrism, by virtue of being universalist. So, thepagan religion, which had imbued Rome with martial values and a strong sense ofits own superiority, had been displaced. At the same time, remnant paganism wasmuch less united and clear than Christianity, instead being something of ajumble of local traditions and rituals.Clearly, it is more difficult to prove empirically that Roman g rose and fell,because there is less surviving evidence. However, one of the measures that wehave used for Western civilisation is per capita rates of macro-innovation andthese have been calculated for the Classical period. It has been shown that therate of macro-innovation, in the period of Roman dominance, reached a peaksomewhere between 500 and 350 BC and then went into sharp decline down to a lowlevel by around 350 AD at which point it essentially flat-lined until the end ofthe Dark Ages in roughly 1050 AD.[10][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-10] The worldwide macro-innovation ratefor this period is graphed in Figure 11.This evidence of the rise and fall of Roman genius (and thus of its average g)is consistent with the other evidence that we have presented, including lowfertility among the upper class in the 2nd century BC and the collapse of Romandemocracy in the 1st century AD. It shows us that Rome did indeed rise and falland this roughly paralleled the pattern of other proxies for the rise and fallof Roman g and evidence of low fertility among those with higher g in the RomanEmpire.C:\\Users\\matt\\Documents\\percent literate graph.png [../images/00011.jpeg]Figure 11. Rate of innovation based upon Bunch and Helleman’s list. Points arean average over 100 years, fitted to a third-order polynomial curve.[11][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-11]"},{"pageContent":"Contraception and ChristianityBut, if we want to get down to the basic cause of the collapse of Rome, it isthat its level of g rose too high and this set off a process of g decline,because those with the highest levels were both able and willing to limit theirfertility. This is the fate of all advanced civilisations. If they become toocomfortable, which they do if their g reaches a certain level, they lose theirreligion, they lack a sense of the eternal, they run out of steam, and theystart to decline. But why, then, did Roman civilisation collapse before it hadtime to achieve an Industrial Revolution?Gerhard Meisenberg has made the very insightful point that the decline ofWestern civilisation was very likely delayed by its absolute prohibition ofcontraception. In Genesis 38:9, God killed Onan for practising the contraceptivemethod of coitus interruptus:‘He knowing that the children should not be his, when he went in to hisbrother’s wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should beborn in his brother’s name. And therefore the Lord slew him, because he did adetestable thing.’This was used by the Church Fathers to condemn all sex that might not lead toprocreation. St Jerome’s views in Against Jovinian (1:19) summed up thisperspective fairly well:‘But I wonder why he set Judah and Tamar before us for an example, unlessperchance even harlots give him pleasure; or Onan, who was slain because hegrudged his brother seed. Does he imagine that we approve of any sexualintercourse except for the procreation of children?’This taboo on contraception remained in place until well into the 19th centuryand meant that selection for g could continue until the first IndustrialRevolution was able to take place.[12][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-12] In Ancient Greece, Rome, and theMiddle East—where contraception was acceptable—they possibly got to about thelevel of early 18th-century Europe and then declined.Another difference proposed by Meisenberg is the nature of Christianity itself.Unlike the polytheistic religions, monotheistic Christianity—in its undilutedform—is strongly anti-rational. God is not to be negotiated with throughsacrifices but obeyed without question. You do not aim to become like God, butsimply to prostrate yourself before Him. God does not have a personality, likeRoman Gods do, He is simply perfect. He does not exhort you to comprehend Hiscreation. In fact, attempts to do so—such as eating from the Tree of Knowledgeor building the Tower of Babel—are punished by God. Leading Christian figurescondemn ‘wisdom’, in other words ‘rational thought’. St Paul proclaims: ‘For thewisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “Hecatches the wise in their craftiness”’ (I Cor. 3:19). Elsewhere he asserts,‘Jews demand signs and Greeks search for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified,a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles’ (I Cor. 22–24). Thisworld, in contrast to Heaven, is considered a sinful place and everything aboutmankind is sinful and to be repented for. ‘Rational thought’, if it questionsGod’s revealed truth, is thus a form of pride and sinfulness. Your membership ofthe community is not via blood bonds or ritual observance but through theacceptance of certain doctrines, which are superficially illogical, such as theTrinity.[13] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-13] As Tertullian put it,in the most infamous Christian condemnation of rational thought, ‘I believe itbecause it’s absurd!’Those who don’t accept these doctrines are bound for Hell or condemned asheretics. Indeed, Christianity has condemned people to burn at the stake overthe most inconsequential deviations from orthodox dogma. In essence, the Churchdeveloped a view of the world based on supposed revelation and it was not to bequestioned. These included an understanding of the nature of history and thecosmos. By contrast, Islam did not develop such an unworldly theology. The worldis not a sinful place, but a holy place full of pointers to comprehending thenature of God. Though those who insult the Prophet Muhammad or deny theexistence of God are condemned, Islam does not impose a model of the world onits adherents to the same extent. This is a subtle difference but it does placeIslam closer to paganism, where the world also tends to be understood as asacred thing to be comprehended through observation. Meisenberg argues thatIslam developed out of Jewish and Christian ideas at a later stage, when thesociety from which it developed was becoming more rational.The Christianity exported to Europe, argues Meisenberg, not only reflected anearlier stage of development in the Middle East but reached Europe at a time inwhich g was in decline. Accordingly, Christianity is explicitly anti-rational,very strongly discouraging people in Christian societies from questioning itsdogmas in pursuit of, for example, science, although by the 19th centuryEuropean Christianity had essentially been reinterpreted in such a way so as topromote scientific inquiry in the form of Neo-Thomism—no doubt reflecting thehigh level of g of these populations.[14][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-14] Islam shares some of thesedimensions but it can be seen as less pronounced. In the Hadith, the ProphetMuhammad (c.570–632) specifically exhorts Muslims to value knowledge of theworld.[15] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-15] This is in stark contrastto St. Paul, as we have seen. It is written in the Hadith that: ‘the Messengerof Allah said: “Whoever is asked about some knowledge that he knows, then heconceals it, he will be bridled with a bridle of fire”’ (Hadith, 2649); Muhammadsaid: ‘The seeking of knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim’ (Hadith 74), and‘The Prophet also said: “Acquire knowledge and impart it to the people”’ (Hadith107).It is possible that the consequence of this difference is that Europeancivilisation only adopted contraception, for example, at a much higher level ofg than did other civilisations. It only began to question its religiousness at ahigher level of g. This crucial difference permitted it to keep going for longenough to reach the breakthrough of the Industrial Revolution. Ironically, theextreme rationalism of the Enlightenment was borne directly from the adoption ofextreme irrationalism."},{"pageContent":"Islamic CivilisationRome is far from the only historical civilisation that can be plausiblyexplained in terms of changes in the level of average g. In fact, we would arguethat it is true of most of them, at least those that are not destroyed bynatural disasters or sudden, unpredicted invasions. Let’s turn to Islamiccivilisation, which was the dominant power in the West during what, for Europe,was a ‘Dark Age’ in the wake of Rome’s collapse.Islamic civilisation began in the 6th century, led by the Prophet Muhammad. LikeChristianity, it initially attracted the poor and dispossessed, in their casefrom among the herdsmen of the Arabian Peninsula. Fired up by religious fervour,Muhammad began a process of conquest and conversion, taking over vast areas thathad previously been Christian or pagan, taking Islam as far north as Spain. Dueto internal power struggles, what we might loosely call the ‘Islamic World’ was,rather like modern Europe, divided into a series of separate polities. However,the dominant one was the Caliphate, centred in modern day Iraq. During thisprocess, there would have been on-going selection for higher g, something thatwould have been particularly pronounced, in comparison to the Christian world.This is because the Muslims were polygamists, females strongly select for status(hypogamy), and status is significantly achieved through g. In addition, unlikein Christianity, there was no prohibition on marriage for the imams, thepreachers and scholars who might be regarded as roughly equivalent to priests.Accordingly, average g would have increased each generation. This continueduntil the civilisation flowered into the so-called ‘Golden Age of Islam’, whichclearly reflects a very high level of g. This period is conventionallyunderstood to have lasted from about 800 to the sacking of Baghdad in 1258.Under the reign of Harun Al Rashid (756–809) the ‘House of Wisdom’ wasestablished in Baghdad. Scholars were invited there from around the known worldand funded to translate Classical knowledge into Arabic and contribute toknowledge themselves. This period saw the introduction of a simpler writingsystem and of paper, substantial contributions to optics, mathematics, andscience, including al-Jahiz’s concept of the ‘struggle for existence’ inzoology, and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi’s proto-evolutionary idea that humans weredescended from animals. There were also contributions to medicine, such as theunderstanding that hospitals should be placed in areas where meat putrefiesslowly. The Banu Musa brothers invented an automatic flute. The Muslims inventedan early sextant, a simpler system of numerals, and even the fork. This was allunderpinned by a desire for knowledge, which was felt to be demanded by certaininterpretations of the Hadith, and a firm belief in freedom of expression.[16][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-16]However, there were a number of factors that undid this civilisation.Islam—which had helped to build up the civilisation—became increasingly liberal,reflecting the low stress and high standard of living which had been created.The parallels with the Fall of Rome are quite striking. There was the rise, forexample, of Sufi Islam; a mysticism-based version of the faith which was alsostrongly focused around helping the poor. Helping the poor can be understood, tosome extent, to mean helping those who have relatively low g to survive andprocreate. The ascetic, monastic movement in Christianity—as well as the(celibate) priesthood—would have enticed those with high g who would be moreeducated and have more space to contemplate. Likewise, Sufism involved a highlyascetic movement and many of its followers—known as dervishes or fakirs—wereworld-renouncing celibates.[17] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-17]Islam prohibited both infanticide and, other than very early in the pregnancy,abortion. Meisenberg has noted that we expect both of these, due to theirrepulsiveness or dangerousness, to be done out of sheer desperation and thusinvolve women of low g. By contrast, Islamic advances in medicine—and anhistorical lack of prohibition on coitus interruptus—meant that relativelyreliable contraception was developed in the Islamic world.[18][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-18] Even though Islam condoned polygamy,we would expect that, as with Rome, those with higher g—in a context of lowerchild mortality—would be better at using contraception and would be more likelyto only want a small family. They would also be less fervently religious andless motivated by religious injunctions to breed. Accordingly, those with lowerg and who were more religious would ultimately outbreed them and the Gates ofLearning would close. A form of Islam that was far less intellectual would thusarise. This would explain why 64% of important Muslim scientists in TheEncyclopedia of Muslim Scientific Pioneers lived before 1250 and almost 100%lived before 1750.[19] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-19] If werestrict the range to those who died between 700 and 1699, then 50/195 (25.6%)of the Islamic scientists on the current Wikipedia article ‘List of MuslimScientists’ died in the 1000s, the largest group by century of death.[20][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-20] This is in a context in which therewas no significant population increase. So we would suggest this is the peak ofIslamic macro-innovation. Interestingly, this is also the approximate centrepoint of the ‘Golden Age of Islam’ and in the following centuries there isdecline in macro-innovation, until 1258, when the Golden Age is considered to beover. This would be consistent with the argument that changes in average g helpto explain the rise and fall of Islamic civilisation.Of course, there may be a multitude of reasons for the collapse of Islamiccivilisation but one possible interpretation—that would also seem to explainwhat happened to Roman civilisation—is that g reached a point wherecontraception was developed and the upper class, at least, were comfortable andlow in stress. Their levels of religiousness decreased—a key indicator ofdeclining group selection, occurring after the age of conquest and expansion,meaning that this, combined with their ability to use contraception, reducedtheir fertility. At the same time, they took control of their lives and wereattracted to unworldly philosophies, further reducing the fertility of thosewith the highest g. These philosophies involved helping those of low g, soincreasing the fertility of this group. They were, thus, outbred by those of lowg and high religiousness so the open-minded, high g need for civilisation wasreduced and civilisation decayed and went backwards. At the same time, they wereconfronted by ‘desert tribesmen’ in the form of rural, Christian Europeans;barbarians in comparison to Islamic civilisation. These people would have beenunder strong selection for g, ethnocentrism, and religiousness. They would havebeen higher than their opponents in Asabiyyah, being more group selected. Now,it could be argued, the wheel of history has turned. It is Europeans who havedeclining g and have lost their religiousness. And it is the comparatively muchmore group-selected Islamic world which is entering Europe with its highAsabiyyah."},{"pageContent":"Chinese CivilisationIn many ways, Chinese civilisation flew higher than either the Middle East orAncient Rome, and by the year 1000 it was on the verge of an IndustrialRevolution, though it never quite managed it. When the Venetian Marco Polo(1254–1324) arrived in China, he was astonished at how technologically advancedit was. Ancient Chinese achievements included astrology, magnetism, arithmetic,geometry, the compass, the seismograph, the census, a civil service entered viacompetitive examination, matches, pesticide, fertiliser, gunpowder, andprinting. In some cases, these innovations were made a millennium before theywere known in Europe. Chinese engineering accomplishments included the seeddrill, the propeller, the parachute, the use of natural gas as fuel, and theinvention of the mechanical clock. They pioneered forensics in solving crimes,developed a working system of long distance transport, theorised that erosionchanged land formations, documented super-novas, discovered the properties ofnumerous medicinal herbs, and developed secular philosophies.[21][part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-21]However, most of China’s achievements happened during the European Dark Ages andeven earlier. China had pretty much stagnated by the time of Marco Polo’sarrival, and when the Jesuits came to China in the 17th century it had gonebackwards. Indeed, Western Europe had, to a great extent, pulled ahead of it bythis time. General intelligence decline would seem to be a plausible explanationfor this. The Chinese employed contraception, including a number of herbalmethods, which the Europeans did not. As such, those with the highest g couldlimit their fertility in a way that was utterly taboo and even unknown inEurope. Referring back to Figure 11, it can be seen that the per capita rate ofworld innovation reaches a peak in about 550 BC and then goes into decline. Itis generally accepted that Chinese civilisation was in serious decline by 476BC,[22] [part0014_split_005.html#footnote-95129-22] so this is consistent withthe theory that Chinese genius—and thus g—reached a peak and then declined and,with it, Chinese civilisation declined, to be eclipsed by that of AncientGreece."},{"pageContent":"‘What Has Been Will Be Again’Civilisations seem to follow a fairly predictable pattern. Low g, stressful,religious societies undergo group expansion and selection for g via downwardsocial mobility. Eventually, they blossom into civilisations. However,civilisation reduces selection for g due to medicine, improved livingconditions, and lower levels of stress leading to kindly attitudes to the poor.Civilisation innovates contraception and reduces religiousness both by reducingstress and by reflecting an elevated level of g. As a consequence, thewealthiest—who also tend to have higher g —reach a level of rationalism andsecurity where they take control of their lives. They understand that childrenarrive through their effort, not God’s will; their child mortality is relativelylow, they want to give a high standard of living to their children so they cancompete, and they are, anyway, interested in intellectual pursuits andirreligious ideas which incline them not to have children. So, they successfullyuse contraception to reduce their fertility. Those with lower g are less able touse contraception, insufficiently forward thinking to do so, have more stressfullives, are more religious, and are less rational. So, society’s average g startsto decline and civilisation eventually collapses back to a Dark Age. Selectionfor high g then strongly reasserts itself, especially when the climate becomesharsher and colder, and the process occurs all over again. ‘What has been willbe again. What has been done will be done again.

We have already presented the evidence that, inthe West, g was being selected for up until the Industrial Revolution and thatcivilisation was developing as a consequence. With the Industrial Revolution,this selection for g went into reverse and we have demonstrated that g hasdeclined and that serious scientific progress has slowed down and continues todo so. If this is so, we should be able to historically track the rise and fallof the West, just as we have with Rome and, albeit with less certainty, Islamicand Chinese civilisations. And it should follow a relatively similar path.It is our contention that it is possible to do this. It might be argued thatdoing so is a matter of conjecture and is subjective, but there is a degree towhich that is true of any argument that does not involve statistics. Mostargumentation from historians is qualitative, but that doesn’t mean it must bedismissed out of hand. In the following sections, we simply wish to show thatthere is a reasonable case—if no more than that—for arguing that the history ofWestern civilisation fits into the stages outlined by Spengler and there is asound case for arguing that we are now in the winter stage based on what is nowoccurring. In demonstrating this, we will show that the evidence that we are inthe winter of civilisation, based on Spengler’s model, is already being widelydiscussed by experts."},{"pageContent":"The Seeds of Western CivilisationIt’s perhaps simplest to understand the process by following Spengler’s metaphorof the passing of the seasons. Roman civilisation collapses into a Dark Age. TheEuropean Dark Ages is, therefore, the winter of civilisation. It ischaracterised by mass migration—such as the Saxons and Vikings invadingBritain—warfare, and violence. There is very little understanding of science,and religion is combined with belief in many folkloric explanations. Even thelegal system is constructed around God’s interaction with the world, withaccused criminals undergoing assorted trials by ordeal in order to discern theirguilt. Farm animals are smaller than they were in Roman times, because knowledgeof animal husbandry has been lost.[1] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-1]Most people, even royalty and nobility, are illiterate, with literacy thepreserve of a minority of the clergy. Cities have shrunk and fallen intodisrepair. Roman architecture has fallen into ruin and nobody can understand howit could ever have been built.The society is extremely religious. The relatively low g of such a society isreflected in its simple architecture and its childlike, cartoonish artisticproductions. Politically, the society is an autocracy led by a warrior king.Anglo-Saxon kings regularly perished on the battlefield, evidencing the unstablenature of the societal hierarchy. This is the lowest ebb of the precedingcivilisation but it also provides the seeds of the civilisation that is tofollow. So this period could also be characterised as the birth of civilisation."},{"pageContent":"The Spring of CivilisationThis is, essentially, the medieval period, from roughly 1000 to 1500. Thesociety is still extremely religious but it has developed a slightly morescientific form of religiosity. This is reflected in the scholastic movementwhere scholars such as the Italian St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) attempt toconstruct a form of Christianity based around logical principles. Theproto-Reformation, which attempts to purify religion of folkloristic elementsand thus make it more rational, can be seen towards the end of this period. Theform of rule is a feudal monarchy, ultimately underpinned by militarism, but wesee the beginnings of democracy, with England developing a parliament. We seethe beginnings of exploration as well, such as the Crusades and Marco Polo’sexploration of China. Cities grow, though the population is still heavily rural.The society develops concepts such as knightly chivalry, which involveself-control, self-sacrifice, and altruism.In architecture, we see the construction of complex castles and cathedrals whichrequire considerable planning and skill. We find realistic sculptures, inparticular in the form of grave memorials. A number of works of literature,which remain highly influential, such as Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, areproduced towards the end of this period. Feudalism breaks down and is graduallyreplaced by a semi-democratic system of rule by the nobility. All of thesechanges would seem to imply that society is gradually gaining g. As we havediscussed, it is likely that the Black Death gave a very significant boost tosocietal levels of g, hastening the movement to the summer of civilisation. Theperiod could also be characterised as the childhood of civilisation."},{"pageContent":"The Summer of CivilisationThis is approximately 1500 to the 1800s, although there may be a sound case forarguing that the cut-off point should be World War I. In modern Britain, peopleseem to be particularly fascinated by the Tudor period. There appears to be aconstant stream of documentaries and popular books about it. The novel WolfHall, a fictionalised portrayal of Henry VIII’s chief minister Thomas Cromwell,has been a bestseller and has been made into a popular television miniseries.[2][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-2] Why does this period excite us somuch more than the 15th or 17th centuries? There are many possible reasons, butone is that it is the beginning of the summer of civilisation, meaning thatthere are some fantastic breakthroughs in this period. We finally have realisticportraits and sculptures again, meaning we really know what the people of thetime looked like. As society becomes more urban, we have far more recordssurviving, as a huge bureaucracy is set in motion.Society becomes noticeably more rational in this period. The Renaissancequestions many traditional religious beliefs and figures such as Galileo andlater Newton revolutionise how we see the world, with amazing breakthroughs inscientific understanding. With the Reformation, a form of religion based aroundmysticism and obedience to authority is displaced by a, in some senses, morerational form of religion which aims to return to Christian first principles anddevelop a theology and lifestyle logically from there. We see a rise inPuritanism, which preaches strict sexual morality to an extent that had not beencommonly practised before. There had been widespread illegitimacy among thenobility, as we have already noted. This growing rationalism is reflected insome people, like Galileo, taking an essentially philosophical world-view whichhardly includes any mystical elements at all.The society is confident in its own sense of mission and we have explorationinto the New World and the beginnings of colonialism. Relatively strong nationstates develop in Europe, underpinned by growing bureaucracy and perhaps growinglevels of trust. Absolute monarchy is displaced, first in Britain, by aconstitutional monarchy with a limited democracy. Towards the end of thisperiod, we see the Enlightenment. Overtly highly rational, it strongly questionssocietal traditions, including religious belief and the need for a monarchy.With the French Revolution, the monarchy is violently overthrown and, for aperiod, a secularist republic is proclaimed in France.This period is characterised by a kind of youthful vigour. The society—due tothe young age at which people die—is literally ‘young’, by modern standards. Inmodern Britain, 20% of the population is over 60 and about 20% is under 16. InElizabethan England, 36% of the population is under 16 and 7% is over 60.[3][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-3] From our discussion of agedifferences in personality and g alone we can see how this will shift behaviourpatterns to a society that is more risk-taking, adventurous, creative, andself-confident. Think of all the creativity you engaged in as a student beforeyou settled down to sit in front of a computer all day, like almost all of usdo. Think of all the reckless and embarrassing experimentation you engaged inwith sex, booze, and political or religious extremism as well."},{"pageContent":"AutumnThis period can be referred to as middle age. Middle age is when people tend toreach the heights of their professional achievement and many geniuses did theirmost important work in early middle age. The ‘autumn’ works well as a metaphorbecause autumn is harvest time, the period of abundance, the high point of theyear.This period sees the heights of Western intellectual capabilities and thus thebreakthrough of the Industrial Revolution and the peak of per capita innovationlevels. It is characterised by a deep rationalism in philosophy and scientificwork, which very strongly questions traditional religious ideas. Accordingly, weexperience the rise of atheism and the development of atheistic ideologies suchas Marxism and certain forms of nationalism. The Romantic Movement, with itsfocus on the will of the ordinary people and it’s romanticising of them, may beregarded as a kind of religion, a point made by the Romanian anthropologistMircea Eliade (1907–1986).[4] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-4] Forexample, Herder’s Romantic nationalism begins with the dogma that the mostnatural state is for peoples to live in separate nations internally bonded byshared blood, soil, language, and history. The peasant is the purest and leastpolluted manifestation of this ‘folk culture’ and, so, to rebuild it we mustimitate the peasant, who is seen as diligent, honest, and the best manifestationof Man. There is also a strong sense of fate—of a kind of force behind thescenes—in Romantic nationalism, as its development is regarded as inevitable. Itis the ‘Spirit of the Age’ if we follow Hegel’s dialectic in which the world ismerely a reflection of the gradual but continuous self-knowing of the god-likeAbsolute. But, on the other hand, Romanticism is far more rationalised thanChristianity; far less mystical. There are no gods or spirits and nonon-physical existence. So, it is akin to the philosophical movements ofClassical times.Perhaps not unrelated to this, it might be argued that a kind of worship ofscience begins to develop, in which there is a faith that science willinevitably progress forever; again introducing, in effect, a belief in fate.This can be seen in the stage theories of various 19th-century anthropologists,where it was believed to be inevitable that all societies would ultimatelyabandon religion and embrace an entirely scientific world-view. For example,British anthropologist Sir James Frazer (1854–1941) argued in The Golden Boughthat all societies pass through phases of Magic, Religion, and Science.[5][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-5] They would not regress from this butrather continue to become increasingly scientific.Industrialisation leads to mass migration from the countryside to the cities, acollapse in the influence of the Church, a rise in the influence of the newindustrial elite, and a fall in the influence of the nobility, whose influencecame from land ownership. With the decline in religious belief and power of thenobility which was upheld by religion, society begins to become much morematerialistic. The fall of religion and the nobility opens up the idea that allmen are equal and, by the end of the 19th century, Britain has 60% male suffrageand universal suffrage by 1928 not just for males but also females. This beliefin equality can also be found in the key atheistic ideologies of the RomanticMovement. With religion displaced, ordinary people can be persuaded that theyhave no reason to accept an inferior position. Marxism prizes the worker as thepurest manifestation of humanity, though it is not overtly interested in therights of women or cultural minorities. Nationalism prizes the peasant, thoughthis concept of equality is limited to members of its own nation in each case.These ideologies are taken further with feminism, which demands equality for andeven idealises women; multiculturalism, which does the same with regard tonon-Europeans; cultural Marxism, which extends this to sexual minorities and anyminority its advocates consider disempowered; and the animal rights andenvironmentalist movements.Living standards skyrocket as does the population, at least at first. But then,with the development of contraception, people begin to limit their fertility andin some European countries the population growth slows down; only increasing dueto non-European immigration and high immigrant birth-rate. The emphasis onequality and the questioning of all traditional ideas continues and we see therise of feminism, relativism, and the pervading view that life has no meaning.Assorted ideologies stemming from the Romantic Movement, such as Marxism andnationalism, attempt to re-imbue life with meaning, but they degenerate intoterrible wars and their power is fleeting. Towards the end of this period,creativity starts to wane. We produce fewer and fewer macro-innovations."},{"pageContent":"WinterWinter is civilisation’s old age and, if Spengler is correct, we are alreadythere. He predicts that we develop into a highly globalised world, which isruled by a kind of international financial elite who are very distant fromordinary people. This is evidenced by Piketty’s research, which we have alreadydiscussed, of the ever-widening gap between rich and poor in post-Industrialnations. The consequence of this is that nation states are massively limited intheir ability to achieve anything and democracy is debased. Political scientistshave noted that this has been found in declining voter turnout in Westerncountries.[6] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-6] People despair and feelthat their voice can no longer influence events and so they lose faith indemocracy and democracy declines. Technology flourishes, fuelled bymicro-innovation. We have already discussed the way in which levels ofmicro-invention seem to peak much later than do levels of major innovation. Butbecause g is declining and macro-innovation rates are declining also, there iswidespread economic stagnation. This stagnation situation is now being discussedby economists.[7] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-7] Feeling completelyhelpless and no longer trusting party politics, people simply start to electcharismatic individuals who they feel will sort the crisis out and listen totheir woes. This, again, has been highlighted by political scientists andsociologists examining recent electoral trends.[8][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-8] And they are prepared to give themhuge powers in order to do this.We can perhaps see how this parallels the rise of Julius Caesar. It might evenbe argued that the rise of populism in the Western world is a reflection ofthis. The elite hold the ordinary people and their ‘traditional’ values andlifestyles in contempt. The elite compete for moral and intellectual status byadvocating more and more extreme critiques of tradition and hierarchy. Art had,heretofore, focused on religion. It now begins to focus on simply portrayingordinary life and then portraying feelings, subjective perception, and a senseof confusion and, perhaps, hopelessness, a point made by the Britishconservative philosopher Sir Roger Scruton.[9][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-9] Tradition is continuously disdainedin favour of that which is superficially modern and new. Scruton argues thatthere is a pervading sense of despair reflected in the nihilistic philosophy ofpostmodernism; that there is no meaning and no truth and everything true isreally just power and should be questioned. Architecture and art begin to simplyrepeat the styles of the past—mock-Tudor, mock-Georgian—or they become a game ofmeaningless intellectual one-up-manship as can be seen in cows cut in half,empty rooms containing only a single light bulb, and unmade beds, all presentedas cutting-edge art.[10] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-10] Peopleadopt an extreme humanitarian ideology—in the form of multiculturalism andcultural Marxism, at least up to the beginning of the Second Religion. These,along with postmodernism and populist nationalism, are anti-rational ideologiesand their adoption should, therefore, show how far g has fallen. Both involveclear unquestionable dogmas: equality is the ultimate aim; this nation issuperior to others. Political correctness not only hammers away at traditioneven further, but encourages the displacement of the original population withoutsiders who appeal to this very ideology in order to be permitted entry.[11][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-11] The native population goes intodecline. Growing areas of the nation are no longer populated by the descendantsof those who established the civilisation in question in its earlier seasons.This has been highlighted in the UK by the Oxford University demographer DavidColeman.[12] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-12]In his ‘controversial’ book The Strange Death of Europe, British journalistDouglas Murray articulates this condition as a kind of ‘burnout’. Having lostour religious belief, we’ve experimented with various ideological replacementsbut they all come crashing down in the end. Art reflects this despondency: ‘ithas given up that desire to connect to something like the spirit ofreligion...’[13] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-13] Popular literature,notes Murray, seems to be focused around hedonistic despondency. One of thechapter titles in Murray’s book seems to capture what this is like to livethrough. It is called simply, ‘The feeling that the story has run out.’We can perhaps see parallels between cultural Marxism and the place of secularphilosophy in the Fall of Rome. The result of this is a constant state of ethnicstrife in increasingly diverse Western nations and massive immigration intothem, which the financial elite perceive as a good thing because it keeps labourcosts down and renders the populace divided, allowing the elite to retain power.Again, researchers in these areas have highlighted growing levels of ethnicconflict in Western countries which are mainly explained by increasing ethnicdiversity,[14] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-14] and that immigrationdeflates wages, especially of the less educated.[15][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-15] The elite’s advocacy of thisideology, and of multiculturalism more broadly, is part of the basis of theirmoral status so they fear those who would persuade the populace thatmulticulturalism should not be accepted.However, there are those who want to re-imbue the populace with a sense ofmeaning and use the populace as a means of gaining power for themselves. Thenative populace, having lost faith in democracy, uses elections as a means ofshowing their contempt for that very elite. It could even be argued that thisprocess can be seen in the vote for Brexit. Indeed, it is widely accepted amongpolitical commentators that this was a core dimension to Brexit.[16][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-16] Quite what constitutes the new‘Second Religiousness’ is unclear, though if Spengler is right then we should bereaching that stage by now. One possibility is that it will be a form oftraditionalism in which Christianity is an inherent part. Philosophically,traditionalism is the belief that ultimate truth comes from divine revelation,all religions are responses to this perennial truth, and it is passed on byreligious tradition. This being the case, the fact that something is a traditionin a religious society is a justification of it.[17][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-17] Clearly, it is very different fromRomantic nationalism, in which there is no inherent belief in a metaphysicalreality. Perhaps it could be argued that European populist nationalism wouldseem to parallel this traditionalism. The essence of these movements is thattradition (ultimately religiously sanctioned) is positive because it is thebasis of society, tradition is under threat, tradition needs to be protected,and if we do that then we will live better lives. We can do that, in particular,by reconnecting with the religious tradition upon which the society is based.So, in effect, according to this philosophy, we must force ourselves to bereligious.[18] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-18]Another not unrelated possibility is that it will manifest as some kind ofwidespread revival in conservative Christianity. It has been argued, by theBritish historian of religion Karen Armstrong, that this is what has occurred inthe USA from the 1970s onwards.[19] [part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-19]And yet another possibility is the adoption of the broader belief, inherent inChristianity, that ‘Wisdom is found in the East.’[20][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-20] Thus, it may manifest in thewidespread, but genuine, embracing of some form of Eastern religiosity. Both ofthese could be regarded as manifestations of traditionalism to some extent.Spengler notes that the Mystery Cults, which themselves often had Easternorigins, began as people’s vague hobbies before being fully adopted. ManyWesterners currently treat Buddhism, for example, in a similar way.[21][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-21] But the civilisation continues todecline beyond this Silver Age. Eventually, the society is so weakened anddespondent that it can simply be invaded by a society that does have youthfulvigour, perhaps the Islamic world, Russia, or China. These are, of course,societies that industrialised later than in the West and where selection for gonly went into reverse more recently. Again, this is not merely our speculation.Others who have examined this issue in detail have predicted the same.[22][part0015_split_005.html#footnote-94324-22]Clearly, this chapter is composed of possible parallels and conjectures.However, based on the available evidence, they do not appear to be unreasonableor even far-fetched and many are being seriously debated by academic experts inthe related fields. There is a sound case for arguing that Western civilisationhas followed the phases set out by Spengler and that it is now entering itswinter. This is more than speculation. There is, at the very least, a case forit and a not unconvincing one.1 [part0015_split_001.html#footnote-94324-1-backlink] See Lacey, R. & Danziger,D.

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer’s lease hathall too short a date.’[1] [part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-1]All of us are going to die and most of us are going to grow old before we die.This is something that most of us, at least until we get there, put to the backof our minds, but we know that it’s going to happen. Perhaps we have watched asour grandparents become elderly, and can do less and less. For as long as we canremember they’ve been slower and had less energy than our parents. But, as theyget older, they are visiting the doctor more, they give up driving, they need astick to walk, they become forgetful, and eventually they hardly go out at all.If they remain alive, they will start to lose the ability to walk and willrequire more and more care until, ultimately, they become almost childlike.Remember our discussion of cycles. Life is not a linear progression. It is acycle that culminates in old age and death.Those who think about this possibility of degeneration enough—and who plan forit—when they are in early old age can expect to have a far more enjoyable oldage than those who try not to think about it. People who maintain an activesocial life in late middle age will have a much easier time later. Those whoinvolve themselves in all kinds of civic activities—such as neighbourhood watch,the local historical society, party politics, church, or whatever it may be—willhave lots of social contacts and people prepared to help them. Accordingly, whenthey become decrepit, assistance and friends will be at hand and they will notbecome the kind of elderly person who is isolated in their home, seeing nobodyfrom one week to the next, with only the television and an occasional phone callfor company.Similarly, those who accept that they are getting old—and make changesaccordingly—will have an easier time than those who refuse to do so. The obviousexample with elderly people is driving. They eventually understand that they arenot as young as they used to be and they are just too ‘slow’, too forgetful, andtoo poor-sighted to drive. But it often takes a crash for them to realise this.On 10th November 2012, 83-year-old retired stockbroker Geoffrey Lederman wasreturning from a game of bridge in Hampstead in London when he lost control ofhis car, confusing the brake with the accelerator. He mounted the pavement,speeding in the direction of a couple in their early 30s—Ben Brookes-Dutton andhis wife Desreen—and their 2-year-old son, who was in a buggy being pushed byhis father. The father managed to push his son out of the way but the mother washit and instantly killed.[2] [part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-2]Careering onwards, the elderly man crashed into Amy Werner, a 23-year-oldAmerican woman who’d come to London as a postgraduate. She sufferedlife-threatening injuries, but survived, albeit with brain damage and completeloss of sight in one eye.[3] [part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-3] If thedriver had understood that he was elderly—or understood what it really meant tobe elderly—this appalling tragedy could have been avoided.In much the same way, if people appreciate, when they are younger, that old agewill come then they will save for a pension and they will avoid ‘living for thenow’ and wasting money on trivial things that they don’t need. As a consequence,they will have a relatively worry-free final phase of life and won’t be a burdenon their family or the community. And, obviously, if they are health-consciouswhen they are younger they are less likely to be chronically ill in old age,suffering from diabetes, gall-stones, or heart problems. The more intelligentamong us will plan for being elderly when we are not yet elderly and so it willbe less difficult when it (almost) inevitably comes.It could be argued that this is one of the reasons why it is important that weunderstand that civilisations work in cycles and that our civilisation is nowentering old age. There are some colleagues who urged us not to be direct aboutthis; to leave the reader with a series of possibilities that they can thinkabout. But it must be so obvious to you, by now, what precisely our conclusionsare, that this would be dishonest and patronising. As we have said, we have gooddata on the kinds of people who read books like this: academics, universitystudents, former university students, and intelligent people who never went touniversity. There’s no point sugar-coating our view with such people. So let’sjust be direct. We can make old age more bearable by realising that we are goingto become elderly, we need to scale back what we do, and we need to plan forwhen we are really old. As we age, things we used to be able to do—marathonrunning, staying up all night drinking, driving a car—will become at bestdangerous and at worst impossible. After all, we saw in Chapter One that we usedto be able to get from London to New York in three-and-a-half hours, but now wecan’t. We’re too ‘old’ as a civilisation, and therefore our level of g is not ashigh as once it was, so it would be too dangerous to re-launch Concorde. When wewere ‘younger’, and brighter, we could go to the Moon. We can talk wistfullyabout this, much as the elderly reminisce on what they could do when they wereyounger. But we don’t have the skill to do it anymore. It would be far toodangerous for us.If we do not do this, then old age will come as a shock to the system. It willbe the difference between getting gradually less and less well or being hit by acar and ending up in intensive care. All of the markers of a high g society willeventually be beyond our capabilities. We won’t be able to safely flyaeroplanes, or maintain a lavish system of social security, or keep theelectricity on all of the time, or maintain law and order everywhere, ororganise democratic government or have widespread use of the internet. If ourdata are correct, and there’s little reason to think they aren’t, we need tostart to develop the infrastructure to deal with the future. Life is going tobecome more harsh, more dangerous, and simpler. To give an obvious example, manyhouses are now entirely reliant on electricity: no fireplace, no gas. What arethese people supposed to do when electricity becomes unreliable? Many people nowcommute into London from 70 miles away or even more. How are they going to getwork as trains become more and more sporadic? They need to live closer to work,just as we all once did. If we start planning for this—rather than kid ourselvesthat ‘things can only get better’—then things will run far more smoothly whenthe time comes. In much the same way, we need to appreciate the fact that—likethe elderly—we will be living off capital and we cannot allow this capital torun out. This means living well within our means and not wasting money onunnecessary extravagances. Every little has to count. Similarly, our‘civilisation’ is likely to need ‘help’ as it becomes elderly just as we havelong ‘helped’ the developing world. This needs to be borne in mind.To put it another way, we are at the beginning of winter. Even in modern dayBritain, you cannot possibly get through winter by behaving as you do in autumn.At the very least, you need fuel to heat your house, you require warmer clothes,the roads have to be gritted, the food has to be imported or grown in giantgreenhouses and, if there’s snow, it has to be cleared. If the infrastructure isnot there to do these things then there will be chaos. Snow almost always leadsto chaos in Britain, unlike in Scandinavia or Canada, because we are simply notprepared for it."},{"pageContent":"EugenicsSo, one possibility is to prepare for old age and winter and simply accept it asfate. But there are others. We have already seen that Sir Francis Galtonhighlighted the problem of those with lower g outbreeding those with higher g inthe 19th century in his 1869 book Hereditary Genius. Later, he argued that thisproblem could be solved by a programme of ‘eugenics’. This would involvefinancially incentivising those with higher g to have more children. Galton wasperceptive enough to realise that g is associated with intellect, beinginterested in ideas, and thus, to some extent, being disinterested in havingchildren. And so his proposal combined offering financial incentives withinculcating people with a kind of latter-day religiosity, which emphasised theimportance of improving the ‘human stock’.[4][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-4] Likewise, we have already met RichardLynn. In his book Eugenics: A Reassessment, Lynn has defended Galton’s idea(despite the obvious terrible press which eugenics has received) and providedmore detail, for example advocating licensing to have children, with thepermitted number dictated by the couple’s IQ level.[5][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-5]Advances in understanding the genetic basis of traits like g, educationalattainment, and various diseases have led some to propose a liberal eugenicswhich is based on voluntaristic (rather than coercive) approaches to improvingthe inborn characteristics of one’s descendants.[6][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-6] Certain bioethicists, such as theAustralian bioethicist Julian Savulescu, who is based at Oxford University, haveeven argued that individuals are morally obliged to use genetic enhancements ontheir descendants, so as to bring about greater human flourishing. A key problemwith this liberal eugenics is that it is unlikely to ever ‘catch on’, owing towhat bioethicists call the ‘yuck factor’—this is a basic and visceral rejectionof meddling in human nature that colours much of the debate about thedesirability of eugenic intervention among Western populations in particular.Gerhard Meisenberg (who we met earlier) conducted a study into the attitudes of1,464 medical students on whether or not and also under what conditionsreproductive genetic intervention should be acceptable.[7][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-7] He found that ‘the strongest and mostconsistent influence [on attitudes towards the desirability of reproductivegenetic intervention] was an apparently moralistic stance against active andaggressive interference with natural processes in general.’ In other words thesample had negative attitudes towards reproductive genetic intervention,especially if the objective was human enhancement. This suggests that themajority of individuals would likely fail to take advantage of ‘geneticenhancements’, even if they were cheaply and legally available to prospectiveparents, these simply being too ‘yucky’ to contemplate. The fact that leading ahorse to water doesn’t necessarily entail it drinking is less of a problem,however, than the uses to which the increasingly distant and unaccountableglobalist elites—the ones that Spengler predicted would come to dominate thepolitical life of civilisations in winter time, and indeed did—may put suchtechnologies. Recall that the historical period associated with rising levels ofg was also associated with group selection—essentially g could only rise to theextent that it benefitted the group via provision of geniuses, whose innovationscould create new opportunities for group expansion. An elite that is anti-groupselected (i.e. purely self-interested) is likely to enhance in their offspringthose traits that were most important to its success—traits such aspsychopathy.[8] [part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-8] Thus such a‘liberalised’ eugenics is more likely than not to make things worse forcivilisation in its winter years."},{"pageContent":"Nurturing GeniusDutton and Charlton offer another solution, however, and this is a return to asociety that actively encourages genius. We need to recognise the importance ofgenius, identify potential geniuses, and then give them the space they need todo genius work. In essence, they need the things that they find difficult—thatis, practical things that ordinary people have no problem with, like driving acar—dealt with. Otherwise, as unworldly people they won’t require much beyondbasic sustenance and minimum financial security. There should be no pressure topublish, or deal with bureaucracy, or attend conferences. They must simply bepermitted to get on with it, as Newton was. If we can do this, then it ispossible that a genius will come up with ideas regarding how to break the cycleof civilisation, just as they once came up with a way for pretty much breakingthe Malthusian cycle.But the cynic might counter that our geniuses did not come up with a way ofdoing this in the 19th century when they were much more intelligent than ourgeniuses are now and when they were seriously contemplating this issue. So, it’sextremely unlikely that our modern day, far lower g, geniuses are going to havemuch of a chance of solving such an intractable problem. Maybe the best we canhope for is that, given the right environment, some geniuses can work out a wayof colonising Mars before our g dips too low. The colonists will then takecurrent technology to Mars but may well find themselves subject to intenseselection for g for a considerable period due to the planet’s extremely harshconditions: no breathable air, little air pressure, intense solar radiation; theneed to constantly and very carefully plan ahead. Assuming that we wantscientific progress to continue—after all, 90% of us would never have lived ifit hadn’t taken off—this may be our best hope. But even this is very uncertain."},{"pageContent":"ReligionFurthermore, it assumes that we have the will to carry on; the fight in us towish to keep civilisation going forever; some kind of sense of the eternal.Increasingly, people don’t have this in Western countries. The philosopher SirRoger Scruton, whom we met earlier, has argued that the solution is for us to‘live as if’ our lives have eternal significance.[9][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-9] But it’s unclear how we can actuallydo that if we don’t really believe it.So, we come back to Galton’s idea that those with influence should inculcate thepopulation with some form of religiosity and somehow force themselves—throughso-called ‘self-deception’—to believe it, something which tends to make peoplemore persuasive. It seems it is possible to persuade yourself to believesomething if the pay-off is sufficient. Indeed, it has been argued that this iswhy IQ predicts liberal views in a society in which it is considered civilisedto hold liberal views. Cleverer children are more likely to adopt suchviews.[10] [part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-10] In an extremely religioussociety, which made a point of valuing large families, we would expect thosewith higher g to have larger families and so slow down the decline ofcivilisation. As such, the adoption of traditionalism—which argues for thereturn to a religious society—would potentially yield some benefits. It couldslow it down enough that we are able to work out how to colonise another planet.Also, any slow-down would mean that the civilisation that follows ours, drawingupon our achievements, will be able to go even further, before collapsingitself.Following in Galton’s footsteps, Cattell (who we met earlier) proposed that a‘new morality from science’, which he termed Beyondism, be promoted so as topromote eugenic aims and spread eugenic virtues. Beyondism basically advocates asociety organised along scientific lines, with a ‘priestly caste’ ofevolutionary biologists who regulate and plan the evolutionary development ofthe society. Cattell was acutely aware of the role played by group selection inthe evolution of higher levels of g and genius, and consequently proposed that‘cooperative competition’ be employed by the various Beyondist ‘actors’ on theworld stage, whereby:‘[L]ike players in some greater more vital game than men usually play, culturalgroups recognize that the maintenance of inter-group competition isindispensible to evolution and they agree to cooperate in whatever rules arenecessary to maintain it in effective action.’[11][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-11]Cattell also foresaw the problems highlighted previously, in our dealings witheugenics, specifically in relation to the hazards associated with the geneticenhancements favoured by the ‘liberal eugenicists’ of the present day. He sawthese and other ‘eugenical tools’ as needing to ultimately serve the interestsof the group in order for societies to flourish:‘A group positively planning well for its future will employ all three of theabove: (1) differential birth/death rates, (2) rhythms of segregation andwell-chosen-hybridization, and (3) creation of mutations along with geneticengineering... These methods we need to use toward group goals to bring about bya collective movement of its citizens (a) survival of the group, and (b)launching out on its own evolutionary adventure.’[12][part0016_split_005.html#footnote-95433-12]So, Cattell’s Beyondism seems to solve the problem of a eugenics that is unboundto the concerns of the groups (or that could even be used to subvert the groupin the case of ‘liberal eugenics’), at least in theory. It can be looked at as asort of super-charged eugenics, which even fleshes out Galton’s ‘eugenicspirituality’ into a fully developed religious-ethical system. In practice,however, within Beyondism the consequences to a group of losing out incooperative competition are dire—amounting to an essential ‘phasing out’ of thatpopulation. Granted, Cattell saw the ‘rules of the game’ as being essentiallyvoluntary—something that individual nations would agree too—much like armslimitation treaties, and presumably the Beyondist equivalent of the UN or the EUwould ensure that the rules were scrupulously adhered to. Such an abstractmorality is unlikely to appeal to ordinary people and would in all likelihoodneed to be forced onto those people —and thus would be unacceptably coercive, tomost. Were it imposed, it would likely lead to war, hastening the collapse ofcivilisation."},{"pageContent":"Long-Term Knowledge StorageHave you ever wondered how much more advanced we would be today had the RoyalLibrary of Alexandria not been burned in 48 AD?

He took his Bachelor’s degree at Columbia University, New York,majoring in Evolution, Ecology and Environmental Biology. His PhD work concernedthe molecular characterisation of aspects of the life history ecology of thethale cress Arabidopsis thaliana, and was undertaken at the University of London(Royal Holloway). Shortly after completing this work, Woodley of Menie switchedhis focus from plant to human evolutionary and behavioral ecology. His interestsinclude life history theory and personality, primatology, and the evolution ofgeneral intelligence. It is with respect to the last that he is perhaps bestknown, as he has conducted much of the research showing that average generalintelligence is in decline, to the extent that the term ‘Woodley Effect’ haseven been proposed to describe such trends in academic circles. Woodley of Menieis a Fellow of the Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies at the VrijeUniversiteit Brussel in Belgium. He has co-written the academic monographHistorical Variability in Heritable General Intelligence (University ofBuckingham Press, 2013), and its sequel The Rhythm of the West: A Biohistory ofthe Modern Era AD 1600 to the Present (Journal of Social, Political and EconomicStudies, occasional monograph series, no. 37). Woodley of Menie has publicallydiscussed this research in various media, including national and internationalnewspapers such as The Times and The Telegraph and also in various radio,television, and internet formats such as BBC Radio, Al-Jazeera, and The StefanMolyneux Show."},{"pageContent":"Also Available9781845409913.jpg [../images/00012.jpeg]"}]
