It is therefore no light matter to diagnose an indiv idual as a psyc hopat h . Like any psychiatr ic disorder, diagnosis is based on the accumula tion of evidence that an indiv idual satisfies at least the minimal criteria for the disorder . In ca ses based on my own fi les the indiv iduals have been carefully diagnosed on the ba sis of extensive interview and file infor mat ion. However, I have disguised these indiv iduals by altering details and removing identifying infor ma tion, withou.t compromising the point I was trying to make . Although the topic of this book is ps yc hopathy, not everyone described herein is a psychopa th . Many of the examples I use are taken from published reports, the news media, and personal communica tions, and I cannot be sure that the indiv iduals in quest ion are psycho paths, even though they may have been given the label by others . In each ca se, however, the docu­ mented evidence concerning some as pect of the perso n's behav­ ior is either consistent with the concept of ps ychopathy or illust ra tes a key trait or behavior that is typical of the disorder. These individ uals may or may not be psychopath s. But their reported behavior provides a us eful vehicle for elaborating the var ious traits and behaviors that def ine ps yc hopathy. The reader should not ass um e that an individual is a psychopath simpl y beca use of the context in which he or she is portrayed in th is book. ix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Preface and Acknowledgments Psychopaths are social predators who charm, manipulate, and ruthlessly plow their way through life, leaving a broad trail of broken hearts, sha ttered expecta tions, and empt y walle ts. Completely lacking in conscience an d in feelings for others, they self ishly take w hat they want and do as they please, viola ting social norms and expectations without the slightest sense of guilt or regr et. Their bewildered victims desper ately ask, \"Who are these people?\" \"What makes them the way they are?\" \"How can we protect ourselve s?\" Although these and related questions have been the focus of clinical specula tion and empir ical re­ search for over one hundred years-and of my own work for a quarter-centur y-it is prima rily within the last few decades that the deadly mystery of the psychopath has begun to reveal itself. When I agreed to write this book I knew it would be diff icult to present hard scientific dat a and circumspection in a way that the public could underst and. I would have been quite comf ort­ able remaining in my academic ivory tower, having esoter ic dis­ cussions with other researchers and writing technical books and artic les. However, in recent years there has been a dramatic upsur ge in the public' s exposure to the machinations and depre­ dations of psychopa ths . The news media are filled with dramat ic accounts of violent crime, fi nancial sca ndals, and violations of the public trust. Countless movies and books tell the stories of xi"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Preface and Acknowledgments serial killers, con artists, and members of orga nized crime . Al­ though many of these accounts and portr ayals are of psycho­ paths, many others are not, and this important dist inction is often lost on the news media , the enterta inment indust ry, and the publ ic. Even those members of the criminal justice system­ lawyers, forensic psychiatr ists and psychologi sts, social workers, parole officers, law enforce ment officers, correctional sta ff­ whose work daily brings them into contact with psycho paths often have little pra ctical appr eciation of the sort of people they are dealing with . This failure to dist inguish between offenders who are psychopaths and those who are not has dire conse­ quences for society, as this book makes clear. On a more per­ sonal level, it is very likely that at some time in your life you will come into painf ul contact with a psychopath . For your own physical, ps ychologica l, and financial well-being it is crucial that you know how to identify the psycho path, how to protect your­ self, and how to minimize the harm done to you . Much of the scientific literatur e on psychopathy is technica l, abstract, and difficult to follow for those who lack a background in the behavioral scienc es. My goal was to translate this litera­ ture so that it became accessible, not only to the general public but to members of the criminal justice system and the mental health communit y. I tried not to oversimplify theoret ical issues and resear ch findings or to overstate what we know. I hope that those readers whose interest is piqued will use the chapter notes to delve deeper into the topic. The scient ific slant to this book reflects my background in experimental ps ychology and cognitive psychop hysiology . Some readers may be disap pointed to see that I have devoted little space to discussions of psychodynamic issues, such as uncon­ scio us proce sses and conflicts, defense mecha nisms, and so forth . Although many books and hundreds of articles on the ps ychodynamics of psychopathy have been written over the past fifty yea rs, in my opinion they have not greatly adva nced our understanding of the disorder . To a large extent, this is beca use most psychodynamic accounts of psychopathy have an arm­ chair, often circu lar, qua lity about them and therefore do not readily lend themselves to em pirical study. However, recently there have been some attempts to establish congruence between xii"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Preface and Acknowledgmen ts psych odynamic speculations about psychopathy and the theo­ ries and proc edur es of behavioral science .

The paper de scribed an experiment in which we had used a biomedical recorder to monitor elec trical activity in the bra ins of several groups of adult men while they performed a language task.

To give you some idea of the enor mity of the problem that faces us, consider that there are at least 2 million psychopaths in North Ame rica ; the citizens of New York City have as many as 10 0,000 psychopaths among them . And these are conser vative est imat es. Far from being an esoteric, isolat ed pr oblem that af­ fects only a few people, psychopathy touches virtual ly every one of us. Consider also that the prevalence of psychopathy in our soci­ ety is about the same as that of schizo phrenia, a devast ating mental disorder that brings hea rt-wrenching distr ess to patient and family alike . Howeve r, the scope of the personal pain and distress as sociated with schizoph renia is small compared to the exten sive personal, socia l, and economic carnage wrought by psychopa ths . They cast a wide net, and nearly ever yone is caught in it one way or anot her. The most ob vious expressions of psychopa thy-but by no means the only ones -involve flagrant crim inal violation of soci­ ety's rules . Not sur prisingly, many psychopaths are crimina ls, but many others remain out of pr ison, using their charm and chameleonlike abilities to cut a wide swath through society and leaving a wake of ruined lives be hind them . Toge ther, these pieces of the puzzle form an image of a self ­ centered, cal lous, and remor seless person prof oundly lacking in empathy and the ability to form warm emot ional rela tionships with others, a person who functions without the restraints of conscience . If you think ab out it, you will realize that what is missing in this picture are the very qualities that allow human beings to live in social harmony . It is not a pr etty picture, and some expr ess doubt that such people exis t. To dispel this doubt you need only con sider the mor e dramat ic examples of psychopathy that have been increas­ ing in our society in recent yea rs.

We are far more likely to lose our life savings to an oily-tongued swindler than our lives to a steely­ eyed killer. Neverth eless, high-pr ofile cases have considerable value . Typ­ ically they are well documented, alerting us to the fact that such people exist, and that before being caught they were relatives, neighbors, or co-workers of people just like us. These exa mples also illu strate a frightful and perple xing theme that runs through the case histories of all psychopa ths: a deeply distur bing inabil­ ity to care about the pain and suffering experienced by others­ in short, a complete lack of empa thy, the prerequ isite for love. In a despe rate attempt to explain this lack, we turn first to family backgro und, but there is little to help us there . It is true that the childhoods of some psychopaths were chara cterized by material and emot ional depr iva tion and physical abuse, but for every adult ps ychopath from a troubled backgro und there is another whose family life appa rently was warm and nur turing, and whose siblings are nor mal, conscient ious people with the abilit y to care deeply for others . Fu rthermore, most people who had horrible childhoods do not become psychopaths or callous killers .

A maj or par t of this quest has been a concerted effort to de­ velop an ac curate means by which to ide ntify psychopaths among us. For, if we can't spot them, we are doomed to be their vict ims, both as individuals and as a societ y. To give just one, all-too-common example, most people are perplexed when­ ever a convicted killer, paroled from prison, promptly commits another violent off ense .

Ray After I received my mast er' s degree in psychology in the early 1960s, I looked for a job to help support my wife and inf ant daught er and to pay for the next stage of my educati on. Without having been inside a prison before, I found myself employed as the sole psychologist at the Brit ish Colum bia Penitentia ry. I had no practical work experience as a psychologist and no particu lar interest in clinical psychol ogy or crimin ological issu es. The maximum-sec urity penitentiar y near Va ncouver was a for­ midable institution housing the kinds of cri minals I had only heard about through the media . To say I was on unfamiliar ground is an understat ement. I started work completely cold-with no training program or sage mentor to hint at how one went about being a prison psy­ cholog ist. On the first day I met the warden and his admi nistra­ tive staff, all of whom wore uniforms and some of whom wore sidear ms. The prison was run along militar y lines, and accord­ ingly I was expected to wear a \"u niform\" consist ing of a blue 9"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE blazer, gray flan nel trousers, an d black sho es. I convinced the warden that the ou tfit was unnec essar y, but he nevertheless insisted that one at least be made for me by the prison shop, and I was sent down to be measur ed. The result was an early sign that all was not as orderly as the place appe ared : The jac ket sleeves were far too short, the tro u­ sers legs were of hilariously discrepant length, and the shoes differed from each other by two sizes . I found the latter pa rticu­ larly perplexing, beca use the inmat e who had measured my feet had been extremely meticulous in tracing them out on a sheet of brown paper. How he could have produced two en tirely diff erent-sized shoes, even after several complaints on my part, was difficult to imagine . I could only assume that he was giving me a mess age of some sort. My first workday was quite eventf ul. I was shown to my office, an immense area on the top floor of the pr ison, far differ­ ent from the intimate, tru st-inspir ing burrow I had hoped for. I was isolated from the rest of the inst itution and had to pass through several sets of locked doors to reach my office . On the wall above my desk was a highly conspicuous red button . A guard who had no idea what a psychologist was supposed to do in a prison -an ignorance I shared-told me that the button was for an emer gency, but that if I ever need to press it, I should not expect help to arrive immediately. The psychologist who was my predec essor had left a small library in the off ice . It consisted mainly of books on psychologi­ cal tests, such as the Rorschach Ink Blot Test and the Thema tic App erception Test. I knew something about such tests but had never used them, so the books-among the few obj ects in the prison that seemed familiar -only reinforced my sense that I wa s in for a diff icult time . I wasn't in my office for more than an hour when my first \"client\" arriv ed. He was a ta ll, slim, dar k-hair ed man in his thirtie s. The air around him seemed to buzz, and the eye contact he made with me was so direct and intense that I wondered if I had ever really looked anybody in the eye bef ore.

Look, I've got a proble m. I need your help . I'd really like to talk to you about this .\" Eager to begin work as a genuine psychother apist, I asked him to tell me about it. In response, he pulled out a knife and waved it in front of my nose, all the while smiling and main­ taining that intense eye conta ct. My first thought was to push the red button behind me, which was in Ra y's plain view and the purpose of which was unmist akable . Perha ps beca use I sensed that he was only testing me, or per haps beca use I knew that pushing the button would do no good if he really intended to harm me, I refr ain ed. Once he determined that I wasn't going to push the button, he explained that he intended to use the knife not on me but on another inmate who had been making overtures to his \"pro­ teg e,\" a prison term for the more pass ive member of a homosex­ ual pair ing. Just why he was telling me this was not immedia tely clear, but I soon suspe cted that he was checking me out, trying to determine what sort of a prison emp loyee I was. If I said nothing about the incident to the admini stra tion, I would be violating a strict prison rule that required staff to repor t posses­ sion of a weapon of any sort. On the other hand, I knew that if I did report him, word would get around that I was not an inmate-or iented psychologist, and my job would be even more difficult than it was promising to be . Following our session, in which he described his \"pr oblem\" not once or twice but many time s, I kept quiet about the knife . To my relief , he didn't stab the other inmate, but it soon beca me evident that Ray had caught me in his trap: I had shown myself to be a soft touch who would overlook clear violations of funda mental prison rules in order to develop \"pr ofessional\" rappor t with the inmat es. From that first meet ing on, Ray managed to make my eight­ month stint at the prison miserab le. His constant demands on my time and his attempts to manipulate me into doing things for him were unending . On one occa sion, he convinced me that he would make a good cook-he felt he had a natural bent for cooking, he thought he would become a chef when he was relea sed, this was a great opp ortunity to try out some of his ideas to make institutional food preparation more efficient, H"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE etc.- and I suppor ted his request for a transfer from the ma­ chine shop (whe re he had appar ently made the knif e). What I didn't consider was that the kitchen was a source of sugar, pota­ toes, fruit, and other ingredients that could be turned int o alco­ hol . Several months after I had recommended the transfer, there was a mighty eruption below the floorboards directly under the ward en's table. When the commotion died down, we found an elaborate system for dist illing alcohol below the floor. Something had gone wrong and one of the pots had explod ed.

Once out of \"the hole, \" Ray app eared in my office as if noth­ ing had happened and asked for a tra nsfer from the kitchen to the auto shop-he really felt he had a knack, he saw the need to prepar e himself for the outside world, if he only had the time to practice he could have his own body shop on the outside . . . . I wa s still feeling the sting of having arranged the first transfer, but eventually he wore me down . Soon afterward I decided to leave the prison to pursue a Ph .D. in psychology, and about a month before I left Ray almost per­ suaded me to ask my fa ther, a roofing contractor, to offer him a job as par t of an appl ication for par ole. When I mentioned this to some of the prison staff, they found it har d to stop laugh­ ing. They knew Ray well, they'd all been taken in by his schemes and plans for reform, and one by one they had resolved to adopt a skeptical ap proach to him . Jaded? I thought so at the time . But the fact was that their picture of Ray was clearer than mine - despite my job de scription . Theirs had been brought into focus by years of exper ience with people like him . Ray had an incredible ability to con not just me but every­ body . He could talk, and lie, with a smoothness and a directness that sometimes momentar ily disarmed even the most experi­ enced and cynical of the prison staff. When I met him he had a long criminal record behind him (and, as it turned out, ahead of him); about half his adult life had been spent in prison, and many of his crimes had been viole nt. Yet he convinced me, and 1.2"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"\"E xp eriencing\" the Psychopath others more experienced than I, of his readiness to ref orm, that his interest in crime had been completely ove rshadowed by a driving passion in-well, cooking, mechanics, you name it. He lied endlessly, lazily, about everything, and it distur bed him not a whit whenever I pointed out something in his file that contradicted one of his lies . He would simply change the subj ect and spin off in a different direct ion. Finally convinced that he might not make the perfect job candidate in my father' s firm, I turned down Ray' s request-and was shaken by his nast iness at my ref usal. Before I left the prison for the university, I was still making payments on a 1958 Ford that I could not really afford . One of the officers there, later to become warden, offered to tra de his 1950 Morris Minor for my Ford and to take over my payments . I agreed, and beca use the Morris wasn't in very good shape I took advantage of the prison policy of letting staf f have their cars repaired in the inst itutio n's auto shop-where Ray still worked, thanks (he would have said no thanks) to me . The car received a beaut iful paint job and the motor and drivetra in were recondit ioned . With all our possess ions on top of the car and our baby in a plywood bed in the backseat, my wife and I headed for Ontar io. The first problems appeared soon after we left Va ncouver, when the motor seemed a bit rough . Later, when we encount ered some moder ate inclines, the radiator boiled over. A garage me­ chanic discovered ball bearings in the carbur etor' s float cha mber; he also pointed out where one of the hoses to the radiator had clearly been tampered with . These pro blems were repaired eas­ ily enough, but the next one, which arose while we were going down a long hill, was more seri ous. The brake pedal became very spongy and then simply dropped to the floor-no brakes, and it was a long hill . Fortunately, we made it to a ser vice sta­ tion, where we found that the brake line had been cut so that a slow leak would occ ur. Perhaps it was a coincidence that Ray was working in the auto shop when the car was being tuned up, but I had no doubt that the prison \"te legra ph\" had inf ormed him of the new owner of the car. At the universit y, I prepar ed to write my dissertation on the effects of punishment on human learning and perfor mance .

I'm not sure I thought of Ray at the time, but circu mst ances conspired to bring him to mind . My first job after receiving my Ph .D. was at the University of British Colum bia, not far from the penitentiar y where I had worked several years before . Dur ing registration week in that prec omput er age, I sat behind a table with several colleagues to register long lines of students for their fall classes . As I was dealing with a student my ears pricked up at the mention of my name . \"Yes, I worked as Dr. Har e's assist ant at the peniten­ tiary the whole time he was there, a year or so, I would say it was . Did all his pap erwork for him, filled him in on prison life . Sure, he used to talk over hard cases with me. We worked great together .\" It was Ray, standing at the head of the next line . My assi stant! I broke into the easy flow of his remarks with, \"Oh, really ?\" expecting to disconcert him . \"Hey, Doc, how's it going?\" he called without losing a bea t. Then he simply jumped back into his conversation and took off in another direct ion . Later, when I checked his appl ication form s, it became appar ent that his transcript of previous un iversity courses was fraudulent. To his credit, he had not attempted to regi ster in one of my cours es. Perhaps what fascina ted me most was that Ray remained ab­ solut ely unf lap pable even after his deceit was revealed-a nd that my colleague was clearly going along for the ride. What, in his ps ychological makeup, gave Ray the power to override reality, appar ently without compu nction or concern? As it turned out, I would spend the next twenty-five years doing empirical re­ sear ch to answer that quest ion. The story of Ray has its amusing side now, after so many years . Less amu sing are the case studies of the hundreds of psychopa ths that I have studied since then . I HAD BEEN at the prison for a few months when the adminis tra­ tion sent an inmate to me for psycholog ical testing prior to a paro le heari ng. He was serving a six-year sentence for man­ slaug hter. When I realized that the comple te report of the of­ fense was missing from my files, I asked him to fill me in on the detai ls. The inmate said that his girlfriend 's infant daughter 14"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\"Ex perien cing\" the Psychopath had been crying nons top for hour s and because she smel led he reluctantly decide d to change her diapers . \"She shit all over my hand and I lost my temper,\" he said, a grisly euphemism for what he really did. \"I picked her up by the feet and smashed her against the wall,\" he said with-un believably-a smile on his face. I was stunned by the casual description of his appal l­ ing beha vior, and, th inking about my own infant daughter, I unprofes sionally kicked him out of my office and refused to see him again. Curious about what subsequently happened to this man, I recently tracked down his prison files. I learned that he had received parole a year after I had left the prison, and that he had been killed during a high-speed police chase following a bungle d bank robbery. The prison psychiatrist had diagnosed this man as a psychopath and had recomme nded against pa­ role. The parole board could not really be faulted for having ignor ed this professional advice. At the time, the procedu res for the diagnosis of psychopathy were vague and unreliable, and the implications of such a diagnosis for the pred iction of behavior were not yet known . As we will see, the situation is quite different now, and any parole board whose decision does not take into account current knowledge about psychopathy and recidivism runs the risk of making a potentially disastrous mistake. Elsa and Dan She met him in a laundromat in London, where she was tak­ ing a year off from teaching after a stormy and exhaust ing di­ vorce . She'd seen him around the neighb orhood, and when they finally started to talk she felt as if she knew him . He was open and friendly and they hit it off right away. From the start she thought he was hilar ious. She'd been lonely . The weather was grim and sleet y, she'd alr eady seen every movie and play in the city, and she didn't know a soul east of the Atlant ic. \"Ah, traveler' s lonelin ess,\" Dan crooned sympathet ically over dinner. \"It' s the worst .\" 15"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE After desser t he was embarra ssed to discover he'd come out without his wallet. Elsa was more than happy to pay for dinner, more than happy to sit through the double feature she had seen earlier in the week. At the pub, over drinks, he told her he was a tra nslator for the United Na tion s. He traveled the globe . He was, at the moment, between assi gnments . They saw each other four times that week, five the week after. Dan lived in a flat at the top of a house somewhere in Hamp­ stea d, he told her, but it wasn' t long before he had all but moved in with Elsa . To her amazement, she loved the arrange­ ment. It was against her nature, she wasn't even sur e how it had ha ppened, but after her long stint of loneliness she was having the time of her life . Still, there were details, unexplained, undiscu ssed, that she shoved out of her mind . He never invited her to his home; she never met his frien ds. One night he brought over a carton filled with tape recorders-pla stic-wra pped straight from the factory, unopened; a few days later they were go ne. Once Elsa came home to find three televisions stacked in the corner. \"Storing them for a friend, \" was all he told her. When she pressed for more, he merely shrug ged. The first time Dan failed to show up at a prearranged place, she was frantic that he'd been hurt in traffic-he was always da rting across the street in the middle of the block . He stayed away for three days and was asleep on the bed when she came home in midmorning . The odor of rancid per­ fume and stale beer nearly made her sick, and her fear for his life was replaced with something new for her: aw ful, wild, un­ controllable jealousy . \"Wher e have you been?\" she cried . \"I'v e been so worri ed.

Don' t ask.\" He wa s like a different perso n. But then he seemed to pull himself together, shook the sleep off, and reached out to her. \"I know it hurts you ,\" he said in his old gentle way, \"but think of jealousy as a flu, and wait to get over it. And you will, baby, 1.6"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"E xp eriencing\" the Psychopath you will .\" Like a mother cat licking her kitten, he groomed her back into trusting him . And yet she thought what he'd said about jealousy was so odd. It made her sur e that he had never felt anything like the pain of a broken tru st. One night she asked him lightly if he felt like stepping out to the comer and bringing her an ice cre am. He didn' t reply, and when she glanced up she found him gla ring at her furi ously. \"Always got everything you wanted, didn't yo u,\" he said in a strange, snide way . \"Any little thing little Elsa wanted, some­ body always jumped up and ran out and bought it for her, didn't they?\" \"Are you kidding? I'm not like that. What are you talking abou t?\" He got up from the chair and walked out. She never saw him again. The Twins On their twin daugh ters' thirtieth birthday, Helen and Steve looked back with mixed feelings . Every burst of pride in Arie l's acc omplishments was cut short by an aw ful memor y of Alic e's unpredictable, usually dest ructive, and often expensive behav­ ior. They were fraternal twins but had always borne a striking physical resemblance to each other; however, in persona lity they differed like day and night- per haps the more appr opr iate meta­ phor was heaven and hell . If an ything, the contra st had grown sta rker over three de­ cades. Ariel had called last week to share great new s-- the senior partners had made it clear to her that if she continued as she wa s, she surely would be invited to join their ranks in four or five yea rs. The call from Alic e-o r rather Alic e's floor coun­ selor-was not so cheerf ul. Alice and another resident at the halfway house had left in the middle of the night and hadn't been seen in two days . The last time this had happened, Alice had surfaced in Alask a, hu ngry and pennile ss. By then, her parents had lost count of how many times they had wired money and arranged for Alice to fly home . While Ariel had had her share of probl ems growing up, they 1.7"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE had always been mor e or less norma l. She had been moody and sullen when she didn't get her way, even more so dur ing adole scence . She had tried cigarettes and marij uana in her junior year in high school; she had dropped out of college in her soph­ omore year, fearing that her lack of direction meant that she lacked potentia l. During that year in the work force, though, Ariel decided on law school, and from that point on nothing could stop her. She was focused, fa scina ted, and ambit ious . She made Law Review in school, gra duated with honors, and landed the job she went after in her first inter view . With Alice, there had always been \"something a little off. \" Both girls were little beaut ies, but Helen was amazed to see that even at age three or four Alice knew how to use her looks and her little-g irl cuteness to get her way . Helen even felt that some­ how Alice knew how to flirt-she put on all her airs when there were men around -even though having such thoughts about her young daughter made her feel terribly guilt y. Helen felt even guiltier when a small kitten given to the girls by a cousin was found dead, strangled, in the ya rd. Ariel clearly was hea rt­ broken; Alic e's tears seemed a little forc ed . Much as she tried to banish the thought, Helen felt that Alice had had something to do with the kitt en's death . Sisters fight, but again, \"something was off, \" in the way these twins went at it. Ariel was always on the def ensive; Alice was always the ag gressor, and she seemed to take special plea sure in ruining her sist er' s thin gs . It was a great relief to everybody when Alice left home at age seventeen-at lea st Ariel could now live in peace . It soon beca me clear, however, that upon moving out of the house Alice had discovered drugs . Now she was not only unpr edictab le, impuls ive, and liable to throw fierce tan­ trums to get her way-she had become an addict, and she sup­ por ted her habit any way she could, including theft and prost itut ion. Bail and treatment programs- --$10 , 000 for three weeks at one pricey clinic in New Hampsh ire-became a contin­ ual financial drain for Helen and Steve . \"I'm gla d some body in this family is going to be solv ent, \" Steve said when he heard Ariel 's good new s. He had been wonder ing for some time just how much longer he could afford to clean up after Alice . In fact , he had seriously been rec onsider ing the wisdom of trying 18"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"\"Ex periencing\" the Psychopath to keep her out of prison. After all, wasn't it she, not he and Helen, who should face the consequences of her actio ns? Helen was adamant on the subj ect: No child of hers would spend a single night in prison (Alice had already spent quite a number of them, but Helen chose to forget) as long as she was there to pay ba il. It became a question of respon sibility : Helen fully believed that she and Steve had done something wrong in bringing up Alice, although in thirty years of intense self ­ scrutiny she honest ly couldn't ident ify their mist ake . Perhaps it was subcon scio us, though-maybe she hadn't been as enthusi­ ast ic as she might have been when the doctor told her he sus­ pected she would have twi ns. Maybe she had unknowingly slighted Alice, who was hea rtier than Ariel at birth . May be somehow she and Steve had set off the Jek yll and Hyde syn­ drome by insist ing that the girls never dress as twins and go to separate dance schools and summer camps. Maybe ... but Helen doubted it. Didn't all parents make mistak es? Didn' t all par ents ina dvertently favor one child over the other, if only temporarily? Didn't all par ents feel their de­ light in their children ebb and flow with the contingencies of life? Yes inde ed-but not all parents wound up with an Alice . In her search for answers dur ing the girls' childhood, Helen had observed other fa milies intensely, and she had seen some ver y carel ess, very unfair par ents blessed with stable, well-ad j usted childr en. She knew that blatantly abusive parents generally pro­ duced troubled if not dist urbed children, but Helen wa s sure that for all their mistakes, she and Steve har dly fell into that category . So, the girls' thirtieth birthday brought Helen and Steve mixed feelings-gra titude that their twins were physically healthy, happiness that Ariel had found security and fulf illment in her work, and the old, familiar an xiety as to Alic e's wher eabouts and welfare .

Literally it means \"mental illness\" (from psyche, \"mind\"; and pathos, \"dis­ ease\" ), and this is the meaning of the term still found in some dict ionar ies . The confusion is com pounded by the media use of the term as the equivalent of \"insane\" or \"crazy\" : \"The police say a 'psycho' is on the loos e,\" or, \"The guy who killed her must be a 'ps ycho .' \" Most clinic ians and resear chers don' t use the term in this way; they know that psychopathy cannot be understood in terms of traditional views of mental illn ess. Psy chopaths are not disor i­ ented or out of touch with realit y, nor do they experience the delusions, halluc ina tions, or intense subjective distress that char acter ize most other mental disorde rs. Unlike psychotic indi­ vidua ls, psy chopa ths are rational and aware of what they are doing and why. Their behavior is the result of choice, freely exerc ised. So, if a person with a diagnosis of schizop hrenia breaks soci­ ety' s rules-say, by killing the next passer by in response to or­ ders \"received from Martian in a spacesh ip\"-we deem that person not responsi ble \"by rea son of insanit y.\" When a person diagnosed as a psych opath breaks the same rules, he or she is judged sane and is sent to prison . Still, a common response to reports of brutal crimes, particu­ larly serial torture and killing, is: \"A nyone would have to be crazy to do that.\" Perhaps so, but not always in the legal or the psychia tric sense of the term . As I mentioned earlier, some serial killers are ins ane. For ex­ ample, consider Edward Gein, 1 whose horrific and bizarre crimes beca me the ba sis for char acters in a nu mber of movies and books, including Psych o, The Texas Cha insaw Massacre, and The Silence of the lAmbs . Gein killed, mutilated, and sometimes ate his victim s, and he made grotesque obj ect s--- lampshades, clothes, masks -from their body pa rts and skin. At his trial both prosecut ion and defense psy chiatrists agreed that he was psy- 22"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Focusing the Pictu re chotic; the diagnosis was chronic schizophrenia , and the judge committed him to a hospital for the cr iminally insa ne. Most serial killers are not like Gein, however. They may tor­ ture, kill, and mut ilate their victim s-a ppalling behavior that sorely tests our ideas of what \"sanit y\" means -but in most cases there is no evidence that they are deranged, mentally conf used, or psychot ic. Many of these killers-Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Henr y Lee Luca s, to name but a few-have been diag­ nosed as psychopa ths, which means they were sane by current psychiatric and legal standar ds. They were sent to prison and, in some cases, execut ed. But the distinct ion between mentally ill killers and sane but psychopathic murderers was by no means easy to come by. It resulted from a centur ies-long scient ific de­ bate that at times bordered on the metap hysica l. Some Terminology Many researchers, clinic ians, and writers use the terms psycho­ path and sociopath interchangeab ly. For example, in his book The Silence of the Lamb s, Thoma s Ha rris described Ha nnibal Lecter as a \"pur e sociopa th, \" whereas the writer of the movie version called him a \"pu re psychopath .\" Sometimes the term sociopathy is used beca use it is less likely than is psychopathy to be conf used with psychot icism or insanity . In his book The Blooding, Joseph Wamba ugh says of Colin Pitch­ fork, an English ra pist-mur derer, \". . . it was a pity that the psychiatr ist didn't choose to describe him as a 'sociopath' in­ stead of a 'ps ychopath' in his report, beca use of the misun der­ standing that accompanies the latt er. Everyone connected with the case seemed to confuse the word [ps ych opath] with 'psychot ic.' \" In many cases the choice of term reflects the user ' s views on the origins and determ inan ts of the clinical syndrome or disorder described in this bo ok. Thus, some clinicia ns and resear chers­ as well as most sociologists and criminologists -who believe that the syndrome is forged entirely by social forces and early exper i­ ences prefer the term sociopath, wher eas those- including this writer-who feel that psychologica l, biologica l, an d genetic fac- 23"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE tors also con tribute to development of the syndrome generally use the term psyc h o path . The same indivi dual therefore could be diagnosed as a sociopath by one expert and as a psychopath by another. Consider the following exchange between an offender (0) and one of my graduat e students (S): s: \"Did you get any feed back from the prison psychiatrist who assessed you?\" o: \"She told me I was a . . . not a sociopath . . . a psycho­ path . This was comic al. She said not to worry about it be­ cause you can have a doctor or lawyer who is a psychop ath . I said, 'Yeah, I unde rstand tha t.

' She just ab out fell off her chair. If some­ one wants to diagnose me I'd rather be a psychopath than a sociopath . ' \" s: \"Ar en't they the same thing?\" o: \"No , t h e y' r e not. You see, a sociopa th misbehaves be­ cause he' s been b r ough t up wr ong. Maybe he's got a bee f with society . I've got no beef with society . I'm not harboring hostility . It's just the way I am. Yeah, I guess I'd be a psychopath .\" A term that was supposed to have much the same meaning as \"ps ychopath\" or \"sociopath\" is anti social perso nality disorder, de scribed in the third edit ion of the Amer ican Psychiatric Associ­ ation' s Diagnostic and Statisti cal Ma nual of Ment al Disorders (DSM­ III; 1980) and its revision (DSM -III-R; 1987), widely used as the \"diagnost ic bible\" for mental illn ess. 2 The diagnost ic criteria for ant isocial per sona lity disorder consist primarily of a long list of ant isocial and criminal behavio rs. When the list first ap pear ed it was felt that the average clinician could not reliably assess personality traits such as empa thy, egocentricity, guilt, and so forth . Diagnosis ther efore wa s ba sed on what clinicia ns presum- 24"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Focusing the Picture ably could assess without difficulty, namely obj ective, socially deviant behavi ors . The result has been confusion dur ing the past deca de, with many clinicians mistakenly ass uming that ant isoc ial personal ity disorder and psychopathy are synony mous ter ms. As diag nosed by the DSM-III and the DSM-III-R, as well as by the recently publi shed DSM-IV (1994), \"ant isocial personality disor der\" re­ fers primarily to a cluster of cri minal and ant isocial behavi ors . The maj ority of cri minals easily meet the criteria for such a diag­ no sis. \"Psyc hopath y,\" on the other hand, is def ined by a cluster of both personalit y tra its and socially deviant behavi ors. Most criminals are not psychopaths, and many of the indiv iduals who manage to op era te on the shady side of the law and remain out of prison are psychop aths. Keep this in mind if you have occa­ sion to consult a clinician or counse lor about a psychopath in your life . Make sur e that he or she knows the difference be­ tween ant isocial personalit y disorder and psyc hopathy. 3 A His torical View One of the first clinici ans to write about psychopaths was Philippe Pinel, an ear ly nineteenth-centur y French ps ychiatr ist. He used the term insanity wit hout deliriu m to des cribe a pa ttern of behavior mar ked by utter remorse lessness and a complete lack of restr aint, a pat tern he considered distinct from the ordi­ nary \"evil that men do .\" 4 Pinel rega rded this condition morally neutral, but other writ­ ers considered these pat ients \"morally insan e,\" the very em­ bodiment of evil . So began an argument that spanned genera tions and that seesawed between the view that psycho­ paths were \"mad\" and that they were \"bad\" or even diabolic al. THE DtRTY DOZEN is a classic movie that glorifies a long­ standing Holly wood myth : Turn a psychopath inside out and you find a hero . The plot of the movie concerns a choice given to a handful of the roughest, toug hest crimin als: volunteer for what amou nts to a suicide mission, or stay in prison. The task involves the capture of a castle in which the elite command of 25"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCI ENCE the German army is ensconc ed. Needless to say, the Dirty Dozen succeed in the capture. And needl ess to say, they are honored as heroes , to the apparent gratification of several gen­ erations of audiences. Psychiatrist James Weiss, author of All But Me and Thee, tells a very different tale. His book recounts an investigation conduc ted during World War II by Briga dier Gener al Elliot D. Cook and his assistant, Colonel Ralph Bing . They started at the end point-the Army East Coast Process ing (Detention) Center at Cam p Edwards on Cape Cod-and worked back­ ward to company level to determine how the more than two thous and inma tes had wound up there . The story, as Weiss remarks , was \"the same sad tale\" told over and over again. Knowi ng the comp any was going into a fight, the soldier volunteered to go back for suppl ies and was never heard from again. Or the soldier went from ste aling food to stealing a truck, and totaling it on a joyride . Comple tely unre­ spons ive to interests of their fellow Gls and more attuned to instant gratification than to the fundame ntal rules of caution in combat, these fellows had a much greater chance of getting shot-\"Peterson ... stuck his head up when everyone else had theirs down and a German sniper put a bullet through the middle of it\"-than of acc omplishing an act of heroism that involved planning, cunning , and actions rooted in conscience . The Dirty Dozen might look squeaky clean by the time Holly­ wood gets through with them, but in real life, as Weiss con­ cludes, \"conversi on by combat seldom if ever happe ns.\" (James Weiss, Journal of Operati onal Psychiatry 5, 1974, 119.) World War II gave the debate a new, practica l urgency-more than speculat ion was necessar y . First, with the militar y draft, the need became pressing to ident ify, diagnose, and if pos sible trea t indiv iduals who could disrupt or even dest roy strict mili­ tary cont rol, and this issue drew lively public attenti on. But an even more ominous significance arose with the revelation of the Nazis' machin ery of de struction and their cold-blooded program of exterminat ion.

Identif ying \"True Psychopat hs\" A problem in doing research in prisons is that the inma tes generally are suspicious and mistrus tful of outsiders, pa rticular ly academics .

In the 19 60s psychologists and psychiatrists were by no means in complete agreement on what distinguished the ps ychopath . The problem of clas sification was a maj or stumbling block .

A WOMAN IN Florida bought him a new car. A woman in California bought him a motor home. Who knows who else bought him what else. As a newspaper article descri bing Leslie Gall's cross countr y explo its aptly po inted out, it's all in the name: Gall says it all. The \"sweetheart swind ler,\" as one of his victims referred to him, made his way from widow to widow, bilking them out of all he needed and far more.

When Gall learned that the California police were on his trail, he had his lawyer write a letter to police in Florida saying that he was willing to turn himself in in exchange for a guarantee that he could do his time in a Canadian prison. \"Since the story was made publi c,\" wrote reporter Dale Bra­ zao, California police phone s were \"ringing constantly with calls from people saying they think Gall may have also been involved with their mother or an aunt.

I might have used standard psychological tests to identify psy­ chopat hic inmates, but most of those tests depended on self­ repo rting-for example, \"I lie (1) easily; (2) with some difficulty; (3) nev er. \" The inmate populat ion I was working with was quite adept at figuring out what ps ychiatrists and psychologists were trying to get at when they used tests and interv iews . Generally, they saw no reason to reveal anything of real significance to pr ison staff members but every reason to show themselves to the best advant age with respect to possi ble parole, change of work as signment, admiss ion to some program or other, and so fo rth . Mor eover, the psyc hopaths among them were exper t at dist orting and molding the truth to suit their purpos es. Impres­ sion management was definitely one of their strong suits . As a result, the prison records were often filled with carefully written persona lity profiles that seemed embarra ssi ngly at odds with what everyone else in the prison knew about the inmates in questi on. I recall one file in whi ch the psychologi st had used a ba ttery of self -report tests to conclude that a callous killer was actually a sensit ive, caring individual who needed only the psy­ chological equivalent of a war m hug! Beca use of the uncritical use of persona lity tests, the literature was (and still is) cluttered with studies that pu rported to be about ps ychopa thy but actu­ ally had very little to do with it. One inmat e provided a great example of why I was reluctant to rely on ps ychological tests . During the course of an interview wit h h im in one of my resear ch proj ects, the topic of psychologi­ cal tests came up. He told me that he knew all about them, pa rticula rly about the self-report inventor y most popular with pr ison ps ycholo gists, the Minnesota Mu ltiphasic Personality In­ vento ry, or MMPI . As it turned out, this fellow had in his cell a complet e set of quest ion booklets, scoring sheets, scoring tem­ plates, and int erpr etive manuals for the MMPI .

Rec ently, an inmate in one of my resear ch proj ects had an institutional file that contained thr ee completely diff erent MMPI prof iles. Obtained ab out a year apart, the first suggested that the man was psychotic, the second that he was pe rfectly norma l, and the third that he was mildly dis turb ed. Dur ing our interview he offered the opinion that psycholog ists and psychia­ trists were \"air heads\" who believed anything he told them . He said he had faked mental illness on the first test in order to receive a transfer to the psychia tric unit of the pr ison, where he thought he could do \"easy time . \" On fi nding that the unit was not to his liking (\"t oo many buggy cons \" ) he managed to take another MMPI, this time coming out norma l, and was moved back to the main pr ison. Soon afterward, he decided to portray himself as an xious and depressed, and produc ed an MMPI pro­ file suggestive of mild dist urba nce, whereupon he was given Valium, which he sold to other inma tes . The irony here is that the prison psychologist trea ted each of the three MMPI pr ofiles as valid indica tions of the type and degree of psychia tric dist ur­ bance suffered by the inma te . I decided to gra pple with the class ification problem by not relying solely on self -repor ting . To gather my data, I as sembled a team of clinic ians who were thoroughly fa miliar with Cleckley' s work . They would identif y ps ychopa ths for study in the prison population by means of long, detailed inter views and close study of file infor mation.

Ast ute observ­ ers often get the impression that psycho paths are play -acti ng, mechanically \"reading their lin es .\" One of my ·raters described an interview she did with a pris­ oner: \"I sat down and took out my clipboard, and the first thing this guy told me was what beaut iful eyes I had . He managed to work quite a few compliments on my appear ance into the interview-co uldn't get over my hair. So by the time I wra pped things up I was feeling unusually ... well, pretty . I'm a war y person, espe cially on the job, and can usually spot a phony. When I g ot back outside, I couldn' t believe I'd fallen for a line like that. \" Psyc hopaths may ramble and tell stories that seem unlikely in light of what is known ab out them. Typ ically, they attempt to appear fa miliar with sociology, psychiatry, medicine, psychol­ ogy, philosophy, poetry, litera ture, art, or law. A sig npost to this tra it is often a smooth lack of concern at being found out. One of our prison files describes a psychopathic inmate claiming to have advanced degrees in sociology and ps ycholog y, when in fact he did not even complet e high scho ol. He maintained the fiction dur ing an interview with one of my studen ts, a Ph .D. candidate in psychology; she commented that the inmat e was so confident in his use of technical jar gon and concepts that those not familiar with the field of psycholog y might well have been impr essed .

Almost everyone, that is. Those familiar with the disci­ plines in which Bradfield claimed expertise were quickly able to spot his superficial knowledge of the topi cs. One noted that he had \"a good two-line opening on any subj ect, but nothing mor e.\" Of course it's not always easy to tell whether an individual is being glib or sincere, par ticularly when we know little about the speaker. For example, suppose a woman meets an attractive man in a bar and, while sipping a gla ss of wine, he says the following: I've wasted a lot of my life. You can 't get back the time. I've tried that before, to make up the time by doing more thi ngs . But things just went faster, not better.

They came from a forty-f ive-year-old inmate with a hor ren­ dous criminal record, a man with the highest pos sible score on the Psychopathy Checklist and who had brutalized his wife and abandoned his childr en. In his book Fatal Visi on, 3 Joe McGinniss described his relation­ ship with Jeffrey MacDona ld, a psychopathic physician con­ victed of killing his wife and childr en: For six months following his conviction, maybe seven or eight, finding myself confronted by the most awful set of circumst ances I'd ever known as a writer, and all the while being beseeched by this charming and persua sive man to believe in him, I wrestled with not only the q ue s ti on of his guilt but with another that was in some ways more dis­ turbing: if he could have done this, how could I have liked him? [p. 668] Jeffrey MacDonald sued McGinniss for several things, includ­ ing \"intentional infliction of emotional distr ess.\" Author Joseph Wambaugh testified at the tr ial, and said the following ab out MacDona ld, whom he considered a psyc hopath : I found him to be extremely glib . . .

The world continued to revolve around her as she shone-not the brightest star but the only star,\" said Ann Rule of Diane Downs, who in 1984 was convicted of shoot ing her three small children, killing one an d permanently inj uring the two others . 4 Psyc hopaths have a narc issist ic and gro ssly inflated view of their self -wo rth and importance, a truly ast ounding egocentricity and sense of ent itlement, and see themselves as the center of the universe, as super ior beings who are justified in living ac­ cording to their own rule s. \"It's not that I don't follow the la w,\" said one of our sub jects . \"I follow my own laws . I never violat e my own rules .\" She then desc ribed these rules in terms of \"look­ ing out for number one.\" When another psychopa th, in prison for a variety of crimes including robbery, rape, and fra ud, was asked if he had any weak nesses, he replied, \"I don't have any weakne sses, except maybe I'm too caring .\" On a 10-point scale he rated himself \"an all-round 10.

Psych opaths often come across as arroga nt, shameless brag­ garts-self -assur ed, opinionated, domineering, and cocky. They love to have power and control over others and seem unable to believe that other people have valid opinions different from the irs. They appear char ismat ic or \"electr ifying\" to some people . Psych opaths are seldom embarra ssed about their legal, finan­ cia l, or personal prob lems. Rather, they see them as temporary 38"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Fe elin gs and Rela tionships setbacks, the results of bad luck, unfaithful friends, or an un fair and incompetent system . Although psych opaths often claim to have spec ific goa ls, they show little understanding of the qua lifications required-they have no idea how to achieve their goa ls and little or no chance of attaining them, given their track record and lack of su stained interest in educat ion. The psychopathic inmate thinking about parole might outline vague plans to become a proper ty tycoon or a lawyer for the poor. One inmate, not pa rticula rly literate, managed to copyright the title of a book he was pla nning to write about himself and was already counting the fortune his bestseller would bring. Psyc hopaths feel that their abilities will enable them to become anything they want to be .

Abbott gaine d not only fame from his association with the well-known novelist and political figure; he gained his freedom as well. Shortly after his parole, Abbott got into an altercation with a waiter in a New York restaurant who had asked Abbott to leave. Abbott balked , and the two wound up behind the restaurant, wher e Abbott slipped a knife into the unarmed waiter, Richard Adan , wounding him fatally.

Memory loss, amnesia, black outs, multiple personal ity, and temporary insa nity crop up constantly in int erro gations of psy­ chopath s. For example, a well-pu blicized film clip from a PBS special shows Kenneth Bianchi, one of the inf amous \"Hillside Stranglers\" of Los Angeles, in a pathet ic and transp arent panto­ mime of a case of mult iple personalit y . 6 Although sometimes a psychopath will admit to having per­ formed the actions, he will greatly minimize or even deny the consequences to others . An inmate with a very high score on the Psychopa thy Checklist said that his crimes actually had a pos i­ tive effect on the victim s. \"The next day I'd get the newspaper and read about a caper I'd pulled -a robbery or a rape.

Why doesn' t an ybody understand what I've been going through ?\" 8 Lack of Empathy Many of the characteristics display ed by psychopat hs--espe­ cially their egocentricity, lack of remorse, shallow emotions, and deceitf ulness -are closely ass ociated with a prof ound lack of em­ pathy (an inability to cons truct a mental and emotional \"facsim­ ile\" of another pers on) . They seem unable to \"get into the skin\" or to \"walk in the shoes\" of others, except in a pur ely intellec­ tual sense . The feelings of other people are of no concern to psychopat hs. In some respects they are like the emotionless an droids de­ picted in science fiction, unable to imagine what real humans exper ience .

For example, doc- 44"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Feelings and Relat ionships tors who are too empathic toward their patients would soon become emotionally over whelmed, and their effec tiveness as physic ians would be reduc ed. For them, insen sitivity is circum­ scribed, confined to a specific target gro up. Similar ly, soldiers, gang membe rs, and terrorists may be trained-very effectively, as hist ory has proved over and over again -to view the enemy as less-than-human, as an obj ect without an inner life . Psychopaths, however, display a general lack of empathy. They are indifferent to the rights and suffering of family members and strangers alike. If they do maintain ties with their spouses or chil­ dren it is only because they see their family members as posses­ sions, much like their stereos or automobiles. Indeed, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that some psychopaths are more concerned with the inner workings of their cars than with the inner worlds of their \"loved\" ones . One of our subjects allowed her boyfriend to sexually molest her five-year-old daughter because \"he wore me out. I wasn't ready for more sex that nig ht.\" The woman found it difficult to understand why the authorities took her child into care. \"She belongs to me. Her welfare is my business .\" She didn't protest very much, however-certainly not as much as she did when her car was impounded, during the custody hearing, for nonpayment of traffic tickets. Bec ause of their inability to appr eciate the feelings of others, some psyc hopaths are capable of behavior that normal people find not only horrific but baff ling. For example, they can torture and mutilat e their victims with about the same sense of concern that we feel when we carve a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. However, except in movies and books, very few ps ych opaths commit crimes of this sort . Their call ousness typically emerges in less dramatic, though still devastat ing, ways : par asitically bleeding other people of their possess ions, savings, and dignity; aggressively doing and taking what they want; shamefully ne­ glecting the physical and emotional welfare of their families; engaging in an unending series of casual, impersonal, and trivial sexual relation ships; and so forth .

With their power s of imagination in gear and focused on themselves, psychopaths appear ama zingly unfazed by the pos­ sibility-or even by the cert aint y�{ being found out. When caught in a lie or challenged with the truth, they are seldom perplexed or emba rra ssed-they simply change their stories or attempt to rework the facts so that they appear to be consistent with the lie. The results are a series of contradictory sta tements and a thoroughly conf used listener. Mu ch of the lying seems to have no motiva tion other than what psychologist Pa ul Ekman refers to as a \"duping delig ht.\" 1 0 46"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Feelings and Relat ionships \"I'M A VERY feeling perso n.

When asked if she lied easily, one woman with a high score on the Psychopath y Checkl ist laughed and replied, \"I'm the best. I'm really good at it, I think bec ause I sometimes admit to something bad about myself. They'd think, well, if she's adm itting to that she must be telling the truth about the rest. \" She also said that she some­ times \"salts the mine\" with a nugget of truth. \"If they think some of what you say is true, they usually think it's all true .\" Many observers get the impression that ps ychopaths some­ times are unawar e that they' re lying; it is as if the words take on a life of their own, unfettered by the spea ker' s knowledge 47"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE that the observer is aware of the fa cts .

Needless to say, this man's score on the Psychopathy Checklist was very high . Given their glibness and the facility with which they lie, it is not surprising that psychopaths successf ully cheat, bilk, de­ fraud, con, and manipulate people an d have not the slightest compunction about doing so. They are often forthright in de­ scribing themselves as con men, hu stlers, or fra ud artists . Their statements often reveal their belief that the world is made up of \"givers and takers ,\" predators and prey, and that it would be very foolish not to exploit the weaknesses of others . In addition, they can be very astute at determining what those weaknesses are and at using them for their own benef it. \"I like to con peo­ ple .

Some of their operations are elaborate and well thought out, whereas others are quite simple: stringing along several women at the same time, or convincing family members and friends that money is needed \"to bail me out of a jam.\" What ever the scheme, it is carried off in a cool, self -assured, bra zen manner. \"Oh, the sevent ies, \" reminisced a social activist interviewed for this bo ok. \"I ran a half way house for ex-cons, and split my time between counseling these guys, fi nding them jobs, and raising money to keep the thing goi ng .

He walked over to the couple, smoothly introduced himself as the boa t's owner -\"a complete load of ba lone y,\" he told us­ and invited them aboard to look around. After an enjoyable hour on the boat, the cou ple made an offer to buy. Once the terms had been negot iated, he agreed to meet the couple at the bank the next day and asked for a $1,5 00 deposit to seal the de al. After a friendly par ting, he ca shed their deposit check and never saw them again . \"Money grows on tre es,\" said another psychopa th, a woman with a long hist ory of fra uds and petty thef ts. \"They say it doesn't but it do es. I don't want to do it to people, it's just so easy !\" In the same vein, psychopaths in prison often learn to use the correcti onal facilities to their own advantage and to help shape a pos itive image of themselves for the benefit of the parole boa rd. They take cla sses and degree courses, enroll in programs for drug and alcohol abuse, join relig ious and quasi-religious groups, and adopt what ever self-improvement fa d is in favor­ not to \"rehabilitate\" themselves but to look as if they are doing so. It's not unusual, for example, for a pa rticularly adept manip­ ulator to declare himself \"born again\" in the Christian sense­ not only to convince the par ole board of his sincere resolve to reform but to exploit the elaborate and well-meaning born-again communit y for its support . . . not to ment ion its mat erial re­ sourc es.

CONSIDER: How DO you get people to do what you want them to do?

Ted Bundy , perhaps the most visible and widely known serial killer the United States has ever produced-executed in 1989 for the last in a long string of brutal murders of young women ­ must have ponder ed that question long and hard from every angle. He must have drawn on all his powers of observa tion, which were consider able and were sharpened by his study of psychology in colle ge. He mus t have plumb ed the depths of his knowledge and experience of people's probl ems and vulner abili­ ties-these were hone d by the time he spent as a peer coun­ selor on a crisis hotline. We can't know for sure what went on in Ted Bundy's mind when he began to lu re his victims into his car and drive them to the site of their murders. But we can assume that the above suppositions are true based on the solu­ tions he came up with-varia tions on a theme that he report edly tried over and over again, to get it right. Ted Bundy bought himself a pair of crutches and even went so far as to give the appearance of putting his leg in a cast. Thus temporar ily \"disabled ,\" he asked for assistance from sym­ pathetic young women who might cross the street to avoid a pass but who apparently read ily stopped to lend a hand to a man with a broken leg. Bundy varied the theme- sometimes his arm was in a sling and he found his willing victim on a busy street; some times, with his leg the probl em, he targeted young women at recrea tional areas and gained their aid in securing his boat-\"lt's just down the road\"-to his car. In a terrible way, the ploy was a stroke of genius. Occa sionally it failed and the woman he stopped refused to follow him, but, as recou nted in Ann Rule's book The Stranger Beside Me, it worked very often indeed . 51"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE Rule's book is a study of Bundy's highly refined skill at using his good looks and smooth charm to win the trust of women. In an amazing coincidence, Rule and Bundy worked the same shift on a crisis line for several years before she was called in to write up cases for the police department on a then-unidentified serial killer of young wom en. As the body count mount ed, Rule's suspicions began to rise. But to surface, they had to worm their way through her memories of Bundy's sympathetic and-as her prose makes clear -sexually attractive presence at the desk across from hers on the night shift. That Rule left her work as a police writer to become a bests elling crime writer turned this peculia r coincide nce into an opportun ity for her to show Bundy 's power over others from the inside . The result? A strange and eerie book about a psychopath who said, in answer to a telev ision interviewer who asked whether Bundy thought he deserved to die, \"Good question. I think society deserves to be protected from me and from people like me.\" Shallow Emot ions \"I'm the most cold-blooded son of a bitch that yo u'll ever mee t.\" 11 So Ted Bundy described himself to the police following his final arrest. Psy chopaths seem to suf fer a kind of emot ional poverty that limits the range and depth of their feeli ngs . While at times they appear cold and unemotional, they are prone to drama tic, shal­ low, and shor t-lived displays of feel ing . Ca reful observers are left with the impression that they are play -acting and that little is going on below the su rface . Sometimes they claim to experience strong emotions but are unable to de scribe the subtleties of var ious affective stat es. For exa mple, they equate love with sexual arousal, sadness with fru stration, and anger with irritab ility. \"I believe in emot ion s: hate, an §� r, lust, and greed ,\" said Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalk er.\" Remarks like the following from Diane Downs, who shot her three small children, should cause people to ponder their sheer inappropr iateness and to wonder at the quality of the under ly- 52"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Feelin gs and Rela tionships ing feelin gs . Years after her convictio n, Downs still insists that her children, and she herself , were actually shot by a \"bushy­ haired strang er. \" Abo ut sur viving the shoot ing herself (she sus­ tained an inj ury to her arm, which the jur y concluded was self ­ inflict ed), Downs respon ded: Everybody says, \"You sure are lucky !\" Well, I don 't feel very lucky . I couldn 't tie my damned shoes for about two month s! It is very painful, it is still painful, I have a steel plate in my arm-I will for a year and a half. The scar is going to be there forever. I'm going to remember that night for the rest of my life whether I want to or not. I don't think I was very lucky . I think my kids were lucky . If I had been shot the way they were, we all would have died . 1 3 The ap parent lack of normal affect and emotional depth led psychologists J. H. Johns and H. C. Quay to say that the psycho­ path \"knows the words but not the musi c.\" 14 For example, in a rambling book about hate, violence, and rat ionalizations for his behavior, Jack Abbott made this revea ling comment: \"There are emotions --a whole spectrum of them-that I know only throug h words, through reading and in my immat ure imagin ation . I can imagine I feel these emotions (know, therefore, what they are), but I do not. At age thirty-seven I am barely a precoc ious chi ld. My passions are those of a bo y.\" 1 5 Many clinic ians have commented that the emotions of psycho­ paths are so shallow as to be little more than proto- emoti ons: primitive responses to immedia te nee ds. (I'll discuss the most recent research findings on this topic in lat er chapters .) For ex­ ample, one of our psychopathic subj ects, a twenty-eight-year­ old \"enforcer\" for a loan shark, had this to say about his job: \"Say I have to heav y someone who won't pay up. First I make myself angr y.\" When ask ed if this anger was different from the way he feels when someone insults him or tries to take advan­ tage of him, he replied, \"No. It's all the same . It's progr ammed, all worked out. I could get an gry right now . It's easy to tum on and off.\" Another psychopath in our resea rch said that he did not really understand what others mea nt by \"fe ar. \" However, \"When I 53"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE rob a bank, \" he said, \"I notice that the teller shakes or becomes tongue-t ied . One barfed all over the money . She must have been pretty messed up inside, but I don't know why . If someone pointed a gun at me I guess I'd be afra id, but I wouldn't throw up .\" When asked to describe how he would feel in such a situa­ tion, his reply contained no reference to bodily sensat ions . He said things such as, \"I'd give you the money\" ; \"I'd think of ways to get the drop on yo u\"; \"I'd try and get my ass out of there .\" When asked how he would feel, not what he would think or do, he seemed per plexed . Asked if he ever felt his heart pound or his stomach chum, he replied, \"Of course ! I'm not a robo t. I really get pumped up when I have sex or when I get int o a fig ht. \" Labora tory experiments using biomedical recorders have shown that psychopaths lack the physiological responses nor­ mally associated with fear. 1 6 The significance of this finding is that, for most people, the fear produced by threats of pain or punishment is an unpleasant emot ion and a powerful motivator of behavior. Fear keeps us from doing some things-\"Do it and you'll be sorry\" -but it also makes us do other things-\"Do it or you'll be sorry .\" In each case, it is emotional awareness of the consequences that impels us to take a part icular course of action . Not so with psychopa ths; they merrily plunge on, per­ haps knowing what might happen but not really caring. \"HIS SOCIAL STATUS notwithsta nding , he is truly one of the most dangerous sociopaths I have ever seen ,\" said the Supe­ rior Cour t Judge after sentencing respected 37-year-old San Jose attorney Norman Russell Sjonborg for the brutal slaying of one of his clien ts from whom he had embezzled mone y. His third wife, Terry , who initially had provided him with an alibi for the crime, said that when she first met him, \"He seemed like a nice guy, soft-spoken and exceed ingly charming.\" But she also noted , \"From the start Russ ell spoke about this emotional void, an inability to feel things like everyone else; to know when to cry, when to feel joy.\" Terry also commen ted that he \"led a kind of paint-by-numb ers emotio nal life,\" and that \"he read self­ help psychology books to learn the appr opria te emotio nal re­ spon ses to everyday events.\" 54"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Feelings and Rela tionships As their marriage began to break down Russ ell tried to con­ vince his wife that she was going mad. \"I would go into [coun­ seling] sessions a basket case ,\" she said, \"and Russ ell would sit there calm and gracious and rational , and he'd turn to the therapist and say, 'See what I have to put up with?' and I'd shout and scream and say, 'It's not me.

He'll be a model prisoner, endear himself to the other prisoners and the people in charge. Eventually he'll be transferred to a minimum -security facility. And then he'll escape .\" [From an ar ti­ cle by Rider McDow ell in the January 26, 1992, edition of Image] For most of us, fear and apprehension are associated with a variety of unpleasant bodily sensations, such as sweat ing of the hands, a \"po unding\" heart, dry mouth, mu scle tenseness or weak ness, trem bles, and \"butter flies\" in the stomach . Indeed, we often describe fear in terms of the bodily sensations that 55"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE accom pany them : \"I was so terrified my heart leapt into my throa t\"; \"I tried to speak but my mouth went dry\"; and so forth . These bodily sensa tions do not form par t of what psychopa ths experience as fea r.

Don' t try to understand mur der by using reason .\" [italics mine] 2 More than displays of temper, impul sive acts often result from an aim that plays a central role in most of the ps ycho­ pat h's behavior: to achieve immediat e satisf action, pleasure, or relief. \"The ps ychopath is like an infant, absor bed in his own needs, vehemen tly demanding satiati on, \" wrote psychol­ ogists William and Joan McCord . 3 At an early age most chil­ dren have already begun to post pone plea sur e, compromising with res trictions in the envir onment. A parent can generally use a promise to put off satisf ying a two-y ear-o ld's desires, at least temporarily, but psychopaths never seem to learn this lesson -they do not modif y their desires; they ignore the needs of others . So, family members, emplo yers, and co-workers typically find themselves standing around asking themselves what hap­ pened -j obs are quit, relationships broken off, plans changed, houses ransac ked, people hurt, often for what appears little more than a whim . As the hu sband of a psychopath I studied put it: \"She got up and lef t the table, and that was the last I saw of her for two mont hs .\" One of our subj ects, who scored high on the Psychopathy Checkl ist, said that while walking to a party he decided to buy 58"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Lifestyle a case of beer, but realized that he had lef t his wallet at home six or seven blocks away. Not want ing to walk back, he picked up a heavy piece of wood and robbed the nearest ga s station, seriously inj uring the attenda nt. Psyc hopaths tend to live day-to-day and to change their plans fre quently . They give little serious thought to the futur e and worry about it even less. Nor do they generally show muc h concern about how little they have done with their liv es. \"Look, I'm a drifter, a nomad-I hate being pinned down ,\" is a typical rema rk. One man we interviewed used an analo gy to explain why he \"lived for the moment .\" \"We're always being told to drive def ensively, to mentally plan esca pe routes in case of an emer­ gency, to look well ahead of the car just in front of us. But hey, it's the car just in front of us that' s the real da nger, and if we always look too far ahead we'll hit it. If I always think about tomorrow I won' t be able to live today .\" Poor Behavior Controls Besides being impul sive-doing things on the spur of the mome nt-p sychopaths are highly reactive to perceived insults or slights . Most of us have power ful inh ibitory controls over our behavior; even if we would like to respond aggressively we are usua lly able to \"keep the lid on .\" In psyc hopaths, these inhibitory controls are weak, and the slightest provoca­ tion is suf fi cient to overcome them . As a result, psyc hopaths are short-tempered or hot-headed and tend to respond to fru s­ tra tion, failure, discipline, and crit icism with sudden violence, threa ts, and ver ba l ab use. They take off ense easily and be­ come an gry and aggre ssive over trivia litie s, and often in a context that appears inappr opriate to others . But their out­ bursts, extreme as they may be, are generally shor t-liv ed, and they quickly resume acting as if nothing out of the ordinar y has ha ppened . Carl, an inmate, made a call to his wif e from the prison pay phone and learned that she wouldn' t be able to visit him that weekend and bring him the cigarettes and food he'd requested 59"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE beca use she hadn't been able to fi nd anyone to watch their childr en. \"You fucki ng bitch ,\" he yelled into the phone . \"I'll kill yo u, you whor e.\" He added a convincing touch to the threat by punching the wall and bloodying his knuck les . Im­ media tely after ha nging up, though, he began to laugh and joke with some of his fellow inmates, and seemed genuinely perplexed when a guard, who had heard part of the telephone conversation, cha rged him with verbal abuse and threatening behavior. An inmate in line for dinner was accidentally bumped by an­ other inma te, whom he proceeded to beat sensel ess . The at­ tacker then stepped back into his place in line as if nothing had happened . Despite the fact that he faced solitar y confinement as punishment for the infraction, his only comment when asked to explain himself was, \"I was pissed off. He stepped into my space . I did what I had to do .\" In a classic case of \"displacemen t,\" one of our subj ects had an argument with a very large bouncer at a local pub, lost his temper, and punched a bysta nder. The victim fell back ward, struck his head on the edge of a table, and died two days later. \"I saw red and this guy was laughing at me .\" He blamed the victim for mak ing him mad and accused the hospital of negli­ gence for letting the victim die . Although psy chopa ths have a \"hair trigger\" and readily initi­ ate aggressive displays, their ensuing behavior is not out of con­ trol. On the contrar y, when psychopaths \"blow their stack\" it is as if they are having a temper tantrum; they know exactly what they are doing. Their aggressive displays are \"cold\"; they lack the intense emot ional arousal experienced by others when they lose their temper. For example, when asked if he ever lost control when he got mad, an inmate who scored high on the Psychopathy Checkl ist replied, \"No . I keep myself in contr ol. Like, I decide how much I want to hurt the guy .\" It's not unusual for psyc hopaths to inflict ser ious physical or emotional damage on others, somet imes routinely, and yet re­ fu se to acknowledge that they have a problem controlling their tempers . In most cases, they see their aggressive displays as natural responses to provoca tion. 60"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Lifestyle Need for Excite ment Psychopaths have an ongoing and excessive need for excite­ ment-they long to live in the fast lane or \"on the edg e,\" where the action is. In many cases the action involves breaking the rule s. In The Mask of Sanity (p. 208) Hervey Cleckley describes a psychopathic psychiatrist who never broke the law to any signifi­ cant extent, but who was unable to tolerate the self-containment required by professional life and went on periodic binges. During these weekend outbursts he would shatter his image as a profes­ sional care giver by degrading, insulting, and even physically threatening any woman who found herself in his company. Some psyc hopaths use a wide va riety of drugs as par t of their general search for something new and exciting, and they often move from place to place and job to job sea rching for a fre sh bu zz. One adole scent we interviewed had a novel way of keep­ ing his juices flowing: Somehow, weekend after weekend, he persuaded his buddies to play \"chicken\" with a freight train on a bridge over a rive r. The group would stand on the bridge facing the tra in, and the first to jump would have to buy beer for the rest. Our subj ect, a highly persuasive, machine-gun con­ versationa list, never once had to buy the beer. Many psychopaths describe \"doing crime\" for excitement or thr ills . When asked if she ever did crazy or danger ous things just for fun, one of our female subj ects replied ,\"Yea h, lots of things . But what I find most exciting is wa lking through airports with drugs . Chr ist! What a high !\" A male psychopath said he enjoyed his job as an \"enforcer'' for a drug dealer because of \"the adrenaline rush . When I'm not on the job I'll go into a bar and walk up to someone and blow smoke in his face, and we'll go outside and fight, and usually he ends up liking me and we'll go back in and have a drink or something .\" The television documentar y Diabolical Minds contained an in­ teresting segment on G. Daniel Walker, a criminal with a long record of fra ud, robbery, rape, and murder, and a penchant for bringing lawsuits against everyone in sigh t. 4 Interviewed by former FBI agent Robert Ressler, Walker offered this comment: \"There is a certain excitement when you have escaped from a 61"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE maj or penite ntiar y and you know the red lights are behind you and you know the sirens are goi ng. There is a certain excitement that you just ... it's better than sex. Oh, it's exciting .\" The flip side of this yearning for excitement is an inability to tolerate routine or monoton y . Psyc hopaths are easily bor ed. You are not likely to find them engaged in occ upat ions or activities that are dull, repetitive, or that require intense concentration over long per iods . I can imagine tha t ps ychopaths might func­ tion reasonably well as ai r-tra ffic controllers, but only while things are hect ic and fast paced . During slow periods they would likely goof off or go to sleep, as suming that they even showed up for work. ARE PSYCHOPATHS PARTICULARLY well suited for dangerous profess ions? David Cox, a former student of mine and now a psyc hology professor at Simon Fraser University, doesn't think so. He studied British bomb-disp osal experts in Northern Ire­ land, beginning the research with the expectation that because psychopaths are \"cool under fire\" and have a strong need for excitement they would excel at the job. But he found that the soldier s who performed the exacting and dangerous task of defusing or dismantl ing IRA bombs referred to psychopaths as \"cowboys ,\" unreliable and impuls ive individuals who lacked the perfect ionism and attention to detail needed to stay alive on the job. Most were filtered out during training, and those who slipped through didn't last long. It is just as unlik ely that psychopaths would make good spies , terrorists, or mobsters , simply because their impul siveness, concern only for the moment, and lack of allegia nce to people or causes make them unpr edictable, careless, and undepend­ able-li kely to be \"loose cannons .\" Lack of Responsi bility Obliga tions and commitments mean nothing to ps ychopa ths. Their good intentions -\"1'11 never cheat on you again\" -are promises written on the wind .

The irre spon sibility and unreliability of ps yc hopaths extend to every part of their liv es. Their perf ormance on the job is erratic, with frequent absences, misuse of company resour ces, violations of company policy, and general untru stwort hin ess. They do not honor formal or implied commitments to people, orga nizatio ns, or princi ples. In her book on Diane Downs, Ann Rule de scribed a pat tern of irre spon sible parental behavior that is typical of psychopath s. 5 Downs would often leave her young children alone when there was no babysitter available . The children , ranging in age from fifteen months to six yea rs, were de scribed by neighbors as hun­ gry, emot ionally starved, and generally neglected (they were seen playing outside in winter without shoes or coat s). Downs prof essed to love her children, but her callous indif ference to their physical and emot ional welfare argues other wise . This indifference to the welfare of childr en-th eir own as well as those of the man or woman they happen to be living with at the time-is a common theme in our fi les of psychopa ths . Psyc hopaths see children as an inconvenience . Some, like Dia ne Downs, insist that they care a grea t deal for their children, but their actions belie their wor ds. Typica lly, they leave children on their own for extended per iods or in the care of unreliable sit­ ters . One of our subj ects and her hus band left their one-month­ old infant with an alcoholic friend. The friend became drunk and passed out. When he aw oke he forgot that he was babysit­ ting and left . The parents retu rned some eight hours later to find that their child had been appr ehended by the aut horit ies . The mother was outraged by this viola tion of her parental rights and accused the aut hor ities of depriving the child of her love and affection-a position she maintained even after she was told that the baby was severely malnour ished .

A twenty-five-year­ old inmate in one of our studies has received more than twenty convict ions for da nger ous driving, driving while impair ed, leav­ ing the scene of an accident, driving without a license, and criminal neg ligence causing death . When asked if he would con­ tinue to drive following his release from prison, he replied, \"Why not? Sure I drive fa st, but I'm good at it.

In his experience some pa tients with the HIV virus continued to have unpr otected sex with hea lthy, unsus pect ing pa rtners . He wanted to eva luate his clinical impression that many of these people were psycho­ paths who cared little about the horrendous implications of their irre sponsi ble behavio r. An indu strial ps ychologist commented to me that nuclear power plants carefully screen prospec tive employees, for obvi­ ous reaso ns. However, he volunt eered, the usual screening pro­ cedures -intervi ews, personalit y tests, letters of reference-- do not always succeed in detecting a class of indivi duals notorious for their un reliability and irre spon sibili ty-na mely, psychopa ths. Psych opaths are frequently successful in talking their way out of trouble -\"I've learned my lesson\"; \"You have my word that it won' t happen again\"; \"It was simply a big misunde r­ standing\" ; \"Trust me .\" They are almost as successful in convinc­ ing the criminal justice sys tem of their good intentions and their trustworthin ess. Altho ugh they frequently ma nage to obtain proba tion, a suspended sentence, or early relea se from prison, they simpl y ignore the conditions imposed by the cour ts. That is, even when directly under the yoke of the criminal justice system, they do not meet their obliga tio ns. 64"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Lifestyle PSYCHOPATHS USUALLY DON 'T get along well Wlln one an­ other. The last thing an egoc entric, selfish , deman ding , callous person wants is someone just like him. Two stars is one too many. Occa sionall y, howeve r, psychopaths beco me tempo rary partners in crime- a grim symbiosis with unfortunate conse­ quenc es for other people. Gener ally, one member of the pair is a \"talker\" who gets his or her way through charm , dece it, and manipula tion, whereas the other is a \"doer\" who prefers direct action-i ntimidation and force . As long as their interests are complem entary, they make a formidable pair. Some exam ples from my files illustrate the point. In one case , two young male psychopaths were introduced at a party. One­ the talker-was trying to con a minor drug dealer into letting him have some cocai ne on credit, without success . The other­ the doer-overheard the conversation and, as he put it, \"grabbed the pusher by the balls and convi nced him to provide a free sample for me and my friend .\" Thus began a year- long drug -deal ing partner ship. The talker made the contacts and ar­ ranged the deals; the doer broke legs. When the talker was caug ht, he immediately made a deal with the prosecutor and turned his partner in. In another case, a young woman , a smooth -talking, parasitic psychopa th, constantly compla ined to her friends that her par­ ents were not contri buting enough to her already lavish lifest yle. She met a middl e-aged man, an aggressive, hosti le psychopath , who said, \"Why not do someth ing about it?\" Together, they hatched a plot in which the man would break into the woman 's house and kill her parents. The woman , meanwh ile, would be out of town with friends. The plot fell apart when the woman bragged to her friends that she would soon be rich. Word got to the police, who tapped the woman 's telephone line and gath­ ered enough evidence to charge the pair with conspi racy to commit murder. Each tried to plea-bargain by testifying against the other. Sometimes a psychopath and a borderline psychotic join in a bizarre but deadly partnersh ip, with the former using the latter as a killing tool. A well-known example was provided in Truman Capote 's account of Richa rd Hickock and Perry Smith, exe­ cuted for murdering four memb ers of the Clutter family in 1959 65"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE (In Cold Blood ). Hick ock had all the markings of a smooth­ talking psychopath, whereas Smith was diagnosed as \"nearly ... a paranoid schizophr enic.\" As reported by Capote, Hickock viewed Smith as a natural killer and reasoned that \"such a gift could, under his supervis ion, be profitably explo ited\" [p. 69]. True to form, Hickock put the blame for the murders on his partner: \"It was Perry. I couldn't stop him. He killed them all.\" [p. 260] Early Beh avior Prob lems Most psychopaths begin to exhibit serio us behavioral prob­ lems at an ea rly age . These might include persistent lying, cheat­ ing, theft, fire setting, truancy, cla ss disruption, substance abuse, vandalism, violence, bullying, running away, and preco­ cious sexuality. Because many children exhibit some of these behaviors at one time or another, esp ecially children raised in violent neighborhoods or in disrupted or abusi ve families, it is impo rta nt to emphasize that the psych opat h's hist ory of such behaviors is more extensive and serious than that of most oth­ ers, even when compared with those of siblings and friends raised in similar settings . An example of the psychopathic child is one who comes from an otherwise well-ad j us ted family and starts to steal, take drugs, cut school, and have sexual experi­ ences by age ten or twel ve. Ear ly cruelt y to animals is usuall y a sign of serious emotional or behavioral prob lems. Milwauk ee serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, for example, stunned classmates and neighbors by leaving a trail of grim dues to his pr eoccu pations: the head of a dog impaled on a stick, frogs and cats staked to trees, and a group of animal skeletons kept as a collection. 6 Adult psychopaths usually describe their childhood cruelty to animals as ordinar y events, matter-of-fact, even enj oyable . A man who scored high on the Psychopathy Checklist chuc kled as he told us that when he was ten or eleven he shot \"an irritating mutt\" with a pellet gu n. \"I shot him in the ass and he cried and crawled around awhile and died .\" Another subj ect, serving time for fra ud, told us that as a child 66"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Profi le: Lifestyle he would put a noose around the neck of a cat, tie the other end of the string to the top of a pole, and bat the ca t around the pole with a tennis rack et. He said that his sister raised pup­ pies and he would kill the ones she didn't want to keep . \"I'd tie them to a rail and use their heads for baseball pr act ice ,\" he said, smiling slig htly. Cruelty to other children- including siblings-- is often part of the young psychopa th's inability to exper ienc e the sort of empa­ thy that checks normal peopl e's impulses to inf lict pain, even when enrag ed. \"The shoc king things he did to his baby sister' s doll felt like warnings, but we brushed them aside,\" one mother told me . \"But when he actually tried to smother his sister in her crib and snipped the skin of her neck with a pair of scissors, we realized with horror that we should have tru sted our worst intuitions from the star t.\" Althoug h not all adult psychopaths exhibited this degree of cruelty in their youth, virtually all routinely got themselves into a wide range of difficu lties: lying, theft, vandali sm, promiscuity, and so for th . Inter est ingly, however, the media frequently repor t that wit­ nesses and neighbors are taken completely by surprise in reac­ tion to some senseless crime: \"I just can't believe he was capable of doing a thing like that-there was absolutely no hint tha t he would do it.\" Reactions of this sort reflect not only psyc hopaths' power to manipulat e others' impressions of themselves but the wit nesses' ignorance of their early histor y. Adult Ant iso cial Behavi or Psychopaths consider the rules and expectations of societ y inconvenient and unreasonable, impediments to the behavioral expression of their inclinations and wis hes. They make their own ru les, both as children an d as adults . Impul sive, deceitful children who lack empathy and see the world as their oyster will be much the same as adults . The lifelong continuit y of the self-serving, ant isocial behavior of psychopaths is truly amazing. 67"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCI ENCE To a large extent, this continuit y is responsi ble for the fi ndings, by man y researchers, that the early appear ance of an tisocial ac­ tions is a p ood predictor of adult behavioral probl ems and criminality. Many of the ant isocial acts of psyc hopaths lead to criminal convict ions. Even within prison populations psychopaths stand out, largely beca use their an tisocial and illegal activities are more varied and frequent than are those of other crim inals . Psycho paths tend to have no pa rticu lar affinity, or \"specialt y,\" for any one type of cr ime but tend to try everyt hing . This criminal versa tility is well illust rated in the television progra m, de scribed ea rlier in this cha pter, in which Robert Ressler interviewed G. Daniel Walk er. 8 Following is a brief exchang e from that int erview: \"How long is your rap sheet?\" \"I would think the current one would probably be about twenty-nine or thirty pages .\" \"Twe nty-nine or thirty pag es! Char les Manso n's is only five .\" \"But he was only a killer .\" What Walker meant was that he himself was not only a killer but a criminal of enormous versatilit y, a fact of which he seemed very pr oud. He openly boa sted of having committed more than three hun dred crimes in which he had not been caug ht. Not all ps ycho paths end up in jail. Many of the things they do escape detection or prosecution, or are on the \"sh ady side of the law.\" For them, ant isocial behavior may consist of phony stock promot ions, quest ionable business and prof essional prac­ tice s, spouse or child abuse, and so forth . Many others do things that, althoug h not illeg al, are unethic al, immor al, or har mful to others: phila ndering, chea ting on a spouse, fi nancial or emo­ tio nal neglect of fa mily members, irr espo nsible use of company resources or funds, to name but a few.

Sociobiologists take the view that behavior development is influenced by genetic factors, and they might argue that the number of psyc hopaths must be increa sing, sim­ ply beca use they are very promiscuous and produce large num­ bers of children, some of whom may inherit a predispo sition for psych opathy.

For years afterward Elyse got reports that Jeffrey had been ar­ rested, mostly for robbery and fra ud, once for assault. He went to jail; he got out and worked on a fishing boat for a whi le. The last she heard, he was back in prison for a long term . Often she wondered how she could have trusted him so completely from the beginni ng. She never came up with an ans wer, and the knowledge of how close she had come to being swallowed up by Jeffre y' s charm and then his an ger kept her on guard with the men she met for a very long time. Elyse, a former student of mine, now knows a lot about psy­ cho paths, from both personal experience and for mal training . But she still finds it difficult to understand how people like Jeffrey can so easily worm their way into someon e's life and then simply move on. \"For him,\" she said, \"the ru les of behav­ ior were written in pencil, and he had a big eraser .\" 73"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE E vER SINCE THE release of the book and the movie, The Si­ lence of the Lambs, reporters and television interviewers have been asking me if Hannib al ''the Cannibal'' Lecter, the terrifying central figure who is both a brilliant psychiatrist and a cannibal­ istic murderer, provides us with an accurate picture of the psychopa th. Clearly, as portrayed , Lecter has many of the characteristics of the psychopa th. He is egocentri c, grandiose, callous, manip­ ulative, and remorseless. But he also seems more than a bit crazy . This is not surpris ing, given that both Lecter and the serial killer in the movie, Buffalo Bill, a transvestite who skins his female victims, bear some resemblance to a real-life psy­ chotic serial killer, Edward Gein. The head of the psychiatric hospital for the cri minally insane in which Lecter is hous ed said, \"Oh, he is a mons ter. A pure psychopath . So rare to capture one alive.\" This is of course a grossly inaccurate statement, one that reflects the common assu mption that all psychopaths are grisly serial killers who torture and maim for kicks. If Lecter is a psy­ chopath , he is far from a typical one. If he did exist- he's a fictional character, after all-he wou ld be a member of a rather select club. Serial killer s are extremely rare; there are probably fewer than one hundr ed in North America. In contrast, there may be as many as 2 or 3 million psychopaths in North America. Even if alm ost all serial killers were psychopaths, this would mean that for every psychopath who is a serial killer, there are 20,000 or 30,000 psychopaths who do not commit serial murder. In other words , portrayals of psychopaths that focus on gro­ tesque and sadistic killers such as Lecter give the public a highly distorted view of the disorder. In most instances it is egocentricit y, whim, and the promise of instant gratification for more common place needs , not the drooling satisfaction of bi­ zarre power trips and sexual hungers, that motivate the psycho­ path to break the law. 74"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"In ternal Contr ols: The Missing Piece Brea king the Rule s Society has many ru les, some for malized in laws and others consisting of widely accepted beliefs about what is right and wrong. Each protects us as indiv iduals and strength ens societ y's fabric. Fear of punishment cert ainly helps to keep us in line, but there are other reasons why we follow the rul es: • a rational appraisal of the odds of being caught • a philosophical or theological idea of good and evil • an appr eciation of the need for social cooperation and ha rmony • a capacity for think ing about, and being moved by, the feelings, righ ts, needs, and well- being of those around us Lea rning to behave ac cording to the ru les and regu lations of society, called socia lization, is a complex proc ess. On a practical level it teaches children \"how things are don e.\" In the proc ess, socializa tion-through pa renting, schooling, social exper iences, relig ious training, and so forth-h elps to create a system of be­ liefs, att itudes, and personal standards that det ermine how we int eract with the world around us. Socia lization also contributes. to the formation of what most people call their conscience, the pesky inner voice that helps us to resist tempt ation and to feel guilty when we don' t. Together, this inner voice and the inter­ nalized norms and ru les of society act as an \"inner policema n,\" reg ula ting our behavior even in the absence of the many external contro ls, such as laws, our perceptions of what others expect of us, and real-life police men. It' s no overst atement to say that our internal controls make society work. Our collect ive amazement and fa scination with the psychopa th's utter disregard for rules sugg ests, by com par ison, the power our \"inner policemen\" actu­ ally have over us. However, for psych opaths like Jeffrey, the social experiences that normally build a conscience never take hold . Such people don't have an inner voice to guide them; they know the rules but follow only those they choose to follow, no mat ter what the 75"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE reper cu ssions for others . They have little resistance to tempta­ tion, and their transgressions elicit no guilt. Wit hout the shac k­ les of a nagging conscience, they feel free to satisfy their needs and wants and do whatever they think they ca n get away with . Any ant isocial ac t, from pett y theft to bloody mur der, becomes pos sib le. We don't know why the conscience of the psychopa th-if it exists at all-is so weak. However, we can make some reason­ able gu esses: • Psych opaths have little apt itude for exper iencing the emo­ tional responses -fear and anxiet y-that are the main­ springs of conscience . 1 In most people, early childhood punishment produces lifelong links between social taboos and feelings of anxiet y. The anxiety asso ciated with pot ential punishment for an act helps to sup­ press the act. In fact, anxiet y may help to suppress even the idea of the act: \"I considered taking the money but I quickly put the thought out of my mind .\" But in psychopaths, the links between prohibited acts and anxiet y are weak, and the threat of punishment fa ils to deter them . Per haps for this reason, Jeffrey's record of arrests and convictions looked like the cr iminal hist ory of an amnesiac: No punishment ever had the slightest effect in dissuading him from gratifying his impuls es. PSYCHOP ATHS ARE VERY good at giving their undivi ded attention to things that interest them most and at ignoring other things. Some clinicians have likene d the process to a narrow-beam searchlight that focuses on only one thing at a time. Others sugg est that it is similar to the concentration with which a pred­ ator stalks its prey . This unusual ability to focus attention may or may not be a good thing, depending on the situati on. For exam ple, star ath· letes typically attribute much of their success to the power of concentr ation. A batter who takes his eye off the ball to watch a bird fly by, or who is momen tarily distracted when someone shout s his name, is unlik ely to improve his batting averag e. 76"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"In ternal Contr ols: The Missing Piece On the other hand, many situa tions are complex and require that we pay attention to several things at the same time. If we concentr ate on only what we find most interesti ng, we may miss some thing else of importance, perhaps a danger signal. This is what psychopaths often do: They pay so much attention to obtai ning rewards and enjoying themselves that they ignore sig­ nals that could warn them of danger. For exam ple, some psychopaths earned reputations for being fearless fighter pilots during World War II, staying on their tar­ gets like terriers on an ankle . Yet, these pilots often failed to keep track of such unexciting detai ls as fuel supply, altitude , location, and the position of other planes . Sometimes they be­ came heroes , but more often they were killed or became known as opportu nists, loners, or hotshots who co uldn't be relied on­ except to take care of thems elves . • The \"inner speech\" of ps ych opaths lac ks emot ional punch . Conscience depends not only on the ability to imag ine conse­ quences but on the capac ity to mentally \"talk to onesel f. \" Soviet psychologist A. R. Luria, for example, has shown that inte rnal­ ized speech-the inner voice-plays a crucial role in regulating behavio r. 2 But when psych opaths talk to themselves they are simply \"reading lines .\" When Jeffrey attempted to rape Elyse' s room­ mate, he may have thought to him self, \"Shit . If I do this there'll be hell to pay . Maybe I'll get AIDS, she'll get pregnant, or Elyse will kill me .\" But if these thoughts did run through his mind they would have had about the same emot ion(\\) impact on him if he'd though t, \"Maybe I'll wa tch the ball game tonig ht .\" So, he never seriously considered the effect of his self-gra tifying behavior on any of the people involved, including himself. • Psyc hopaths have a weak capacit y for mentally \"pic tur­ ing\" the consequences of their behavi or. 3 Concrete rewards are pitted against vague future conse­ quences-with the rewards clearly the stronger cont ender. The 77"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE mental image of the consequences fo r the victim are pa rticularly fuzzy. So, Jeffrey saw in Elyse not a companion but rather a \"connec tion\"-a supplier of shelt er, clothing, food, money, rec­ reation, and sexual gratifica tion. The consequences to her of his actions didn' t even enter his consc iou sness. When it became clear that he'd squee zed all he could out of his as sociation with her, he simply moved on to another source of goodies. They Pick and Choose Of course, psychopaths are not comple tely unresponsive to the myriad rules and taboos that hold society toget her. After all, they are not aut omatons, blindly responding to momentary needs, urges, and opp ortuniti es. It is just that they are much freer than the rest of us to pick and choose the rules and restric­ tions they will adhere to . For most of us even the imagined threat of criticism functions to control our behavio r. We are haunted to some degree by questions about our self -worth . As a consequence, we continu­ ally attempt to prove to ourselves and others that we are okay people, credibl e, trustworthy, and competent. In shar p con tra st, the psychopath carries out his ev aluat ion of a situat ion- what he will get out of it and at what cost­ without the usual anxieties, doubts, and concerns about being hu miliated, causing pain, sabotaging future plans, in short, the infinite pos sib ilities that people of conscience consider when de­ liberating possi ble act ion s. For those of us who have been suc­ cessfully socialized, imagining the world as the psychopath experiences it is close to imposs ible.

Think about the driver of that car and the psychopath as occupying opposite ends of a conti nuum of internal restrai nt. The former slavishly follows the rules, and the latter simply ig­ nores them. One passively accepts the supreme authorit y of the inner voice that says \"no\"; the other tells it to \"get lost.\" This inner voice presents problems for those whose beliefs put them in confl ict with society .

Goodf ellas, Misery, Pacific Hei ghts, Sleeping with the Enemy, In Broad Dayligh t, Love, Lies , and Mur der, Small Sacrifices, Cape Fear, In a Child 's Na me, and the particularly explicit chiller The Silence of the l.ilmb s, are just a few of the most popular movies at this writ ing. True and reenacted crime shows, such as Hard Copy, A Current Affa ir, and Am erica 's Most Wanted, are now a television staple . Bruce Weber, in a Febru ary 10, 1991, New York Times article called \"C ozying Up to the Psych opath That Lurks Deep Within ,\" reminded us that the story-t eller's fascinat ion with \"the perversely tw isted mind\" is nothing new: \"From Iago to Nor­ man Bates, Dr. Jek yll to Ha rry Lime, Vladimir Nabakov's Hum­ bert Humbert to David Lync h's Leland Palmer /Bob, the logic of villainy has been fictionally explored, on the page, the stage and the screen, over and over.

What accounts for the terrific power that the persona lity without conscie nce has over our collective imaginat ion? \"C learly, evil is all uring, \" wrote Weber, \"and not just to those who would dr amat ize it. From mild naughtiness to vic ious crimina lity, the performance of bad deeds is some­ thing the rest of the populat ion evidently wants to know abou t. This is one way to explain why the psychopath, that personifi­ ca tion of remor seless evildoing, has such an established plac e in the public conscio usn es s.\" Weber pursued this line of thought with for ensic psychia­ trist Ronald Markman, who (along with Dominick Bosco) wrote Alone with the Dev il, a book about Ma rkma n's profes­ sional work with mur derers . The psychiatrist sug gested that as an aud ience we identif y with psyc hopaths, living out our fa ntasies of life with no internal contr ols . \"There is something inside them that is also inside us and we are attracted to them so we can fi nd out what that something is, \" Mar kman wrote .

He des cribed psyc hopaths in term s of their relationship to societ y: The psychopath is a rebel, a religious disobeyer of prevail­ ing codes and stan dards ... a rebel without a cause, an agitator with out a slogan, a revolutionary wit hout a pro­ gram; in other words , his rebelliousness is aimed to achieve goals satisfactory to him alone; he is incapable of exertions for the sake of ot hers.

In Fritz Lang's classic 1931 movie M, Peter Lorre played a child molester/murderer who snatches his unluc ky vict ims off the streets as the impulse hits him. The police are unable to find the killer, and the underworld of hoods and criminals takes on the job itself. Once it tracks down its prey, the seedy, creepy outlaw mob drags him to a deser ted brewery and tries and convicts him in its own under world court. This movie was one of the most effective dramatizations ever of the notion of \"honor among thiev es.\" Is there honor among thieves? Scratch the surface of the aver­ age prison inmat e and you'll find some sort of moral code-not necessa rily the code of mainst ream society, but a moral code neverth eless, with its own rules and proscripti ons . These crimi­ nals, although at odds with some of the rules and values of society at lar ge, may still follow the rules of their group-a neighborhood, extended family, or gang.

One of our sub jects, for exam­ ple, had a father who was a \"pr ofessional\" thief and a mother who was a prost itute . From an early age he \"went to work\" with his fa ther. More dramat ic examples of these \"su bcultural criminals\" include the maf ia families and the bands of Gypsies common in some parts of Euro pe. • Some criminals can be unde rstood as largely the pmdt\":ts of what is known as \"the cycle of violence .\" Evidence is emerg­ ing to show that victims of early sexual, physica l, or emotional abuse frequently become perpetrators of the same as adults . It is not uncommon, for example, to find that child molest ers were themselves sexually abused, or for wife assau lters to have wit­ nessed domest ic violence at an early age . • Still others run afoul of the law beca use of a powerful need-for example, drug addicts or people without skills or re­ sources who buck their consciences and turn to robbery out of desp erati on. Many of the subj ects in our resear ch first began their criminal act ivities as refugees from broke n, impoverished, or abusive homes; they turned to drugs for comfort or relief, and to crime to supp ort their habit. Others wound up as offenders by committing \"crimes of pas­ sion .\" One of our subj ects, a forty-year-old man without a crimi­ nal record or a hist ory of violence, found some condoms in his wif e's purse, got into a hea ted argument with her, \"went craz y,\" and severely beat her.

TERR ENCE MAUCK'S MOVI E Badlands, loosely based on the killing career of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate , is a chillin g film fantasy with a coldly realistic core . The fantasy resides in the character of Kit Carruthers, whose irresis tible charm and slick patter is absolutely consis tent with the psychopathic profi le but whose attac hment to his girlfriend Holly runs too deep and strong to ring true. One migh t be tempted to dism iss this movie as the typical Hollywood romance of the psychopath with a heart of gold , but look again. Behind Kit sits Holly, strictly along for the ride. It takes a second view­ ing for the real case history to pop into the foreg round: If Kit is the moviema ker's concepti on of a psychopa th, Holly is the real thing , a true \"other\" bri lliantly portrayed by Sissy Spacek as a talking mask. Two aspects of Holly's character exempl ify and dramatize important aspects of the psychopathic personalit y. One is her emotiona l impoveri shment and the clear sense she conveys of simply going through the motions of feeling deeply . One clue is the some times outrageous inappropriateness of her beha vior. After Kit guns down her father before her eyes for objecting to his presence in Holly's life, the fiftee n-year-old youngs ter slaps Kit's face. Later she flops into a chair and complains of a head ­ ache; later still she flees with Kit on a cross-country killing spree after he sets fire to her house to conce al her father's body.

I feel like that myself some times. Don't you? \" The scene ends with Kit locking the two in a root cellar in the middle of the field. Just about to wal k away , he suddenly shoots into the cellar door. \"Think I got 'em?\" he asks, as if swatt ing at flies in the dark . Perhaps the film's most subtle evidence of psychopathy comes through in Holly's narration of the film, delivered in a monotone and embellished with phrases drawn straight from the glossies telling young girls what they should feel. Holly speaks of the love she and Kit share , but the actress manages somehow to convey the notion that Holly has no experiential knowledge of the feelings she reports. If there was ever an exam ple of \"knowing the words but not the music,\" Spac ek's character is it, giving viewers a firsthand experie nce of the odd sensati on, the unnamable distrust and skin-crawling feeling, that many-lay people and professionals alike-report after their in­ teractions with psychopa ths. The Formula for Crime In many respects it is dif ficult to see how any psychopaths ­ with their lack of internal contro ls, their unconventional att i­ tudes about ethics and moralit y, their callous, remorseless, and egocent ric view of the world, and so forth-could manage to avoid coming int o conflict with society at some point in their liv es. A great many do, of course, and their criminal activities cover the spec trum of pos sibil ities, from petty theft and embez­ zlement to ass ault, extort ion, and armed robbery, from vandal­ ism and distur bing the peace to kid napping, murder, and crimes against the state such as treason, esp ionage, and terror ism . Although not all criminals are psychopath s, and not all psy­ chopaths are criminals, ps ychopaths are well represented in our 86"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Crime: The Logical Cho ice prison populations and are respon sible for crime far out of pro­ portion to their numb ers: 3 • On average, about 20 percent of male and female prison inmates are psychopa ths. • Psych opaths are respon sible for more than 50 percent of the serious crimes committ ed. The tru th is, the personalit y structure of the psychopath spells trouble for the rest of us. Just as the great white shar k is a natural killing machine, psychopaths naturally slip int o the role of crimina l. Their rea diness to take advant age of any situation that arises, combined with their lack of the internal controls we know as conscience, crea tes a potent form ula for crime .

ON New YEAR'S Day 1990, twenty-six-year-old Roxanne Mur­ ray killed her forty-two-year-old husb and of five years with a 12- gauge shotgun. She told police she loved her husb and but had to kill him. The cour t agreed , and the charge of second-degree murder was dropped. The husband, Doug (Juicer) Murray, was a \"pseudo-biker\" with a \"need for powerful motorcycles and weak, compl iant wom en, and dogs-all posses sions to be contr olled.\" Over the years he had been charged with a st ring of rapes and assau lts, none of which went to trial, for lack of witnesses . He had been married several times before and typically terrorized and bat­ tered the women he was involved with . In a macabre twist , \"he once ran a home for sexually abused teens. He explo ited them mentally and physical ly as he exploit ed most women, frequently taking compr omising photographs for later us e.\" When Roxan ne complained about the food bills for their four­ teen dogs, Doug dragged her into the trailer, smashed her in the head with a loaded pistol, and shot her favorite dog in front of her. \"That could happen to you,\" he told her. He \"s eemed incapab le of sex without violence or absolute contr ol. Fella tio was someth ing to be dema nded anywhere at any time or a beating followed .

[from an article by Ken McQue en, The Vancouver Sun, March 1, 1991] • An offender who scored high on the Psychopa thy Checklist killed an elderly man dur ing the course of a burglary, and casu­ all y gave this account of the aff air: \"I was rummag ing around when this old geezer comes down stairs and . . . uh . . . he starts yelling and having a fucking fit . . . so I pop him one in the, uh, head and he still doesn't shut up.

Examples abound in the news media . And most people know what it is like to \"lose it,\" sometimes with violent results, and to be appalled at their own acti ons . As I was writing this chapt er, a sixty-five-year-old man with no criminal record was tried for attempted mur der; he stabbed his ex-wife and her lawyer with a pocketknife during an extremely emotional child-custody hear­ ing. A local psychiatrist testified that the man was so over­ wrought that he lost contr ol, \"went on aut omati c,\" and didn' t even remember what he had done . The man, horrified at his action s, was acquitt ed. Even had he been convicted he would have been a good bet for early par ole .

The violence of ps ychopaths, however, lacks normal emo­ tional \"color ing\" and is likely to be preci pitated by everyday events . In a recent study we examined police reports describing the cir cumstances surrounding the most recent violent offenses committed by a sample of male crimin als, about half of whom were psychopat hs. 9 The violent crimes committed by the psy­ chopaths and the other criminals differed in several important ways : o The violence of the other criminals usually occurred dur­ ing a domest ic dispute or a period of intense emotional upheaval, but: o The' violence of the psyc hopaths frequently occurred dur ­ ing commission of a crime or dur ing a drinking bout, or was motivated by revenge or retributi on. o Two-thirds of the victims of the other criminals were fe­ male family members, friends, or acquaintances, but: o Two-thirds of the victims of the psychopa ths were male strangers . In gener al, psychopathic violenc e tends to be callous and cold­ blooded, and more likely to be straigh tforward, uncomplicated, and businessl ike than an expression of deep-seated distress or und erstandable precipitating factors . It lacks the \"j uice\" or power ful emotion that accompanies the violence of most other indivi duals . Perhaps the scariest aspect of psychopa thic violence is the influence it has on the nature of violence in our urban centers . Muggings, drug deals gone ba d, \"wildin gs, \" aggressive panhan­ dling, gang act ivit ies, \"swar min g,\" and attacks on designated target groups such as gays usually involve the dispa ssionate or un provoked use of violence against strangers or victims of convenience .

Not all rapists are psycho paths, of cour se. Some rapists clearly are very distur bed individ uals suffering from a variety of psychia tric and ps ycho­ logical prob lems. Others are the products of cultural and social attitudes that reduce women to subservient roles. The off enses of these men, although repugnant to society and horribly trau­ matic for the victims, may be more underst and able than are those committed by psychopat hs. · Per haps half of the repeat or serial rapists are psycho pat hs. 11 Their acts are the result of a potent mixture : uninhi bited expres­ sion of sexual drives and fanta sies, desir e for power and control, and perception of the victims as obj ects of pleasur e or satisf ac­ tion . This mixture is well illust rated by John Oughton, called the \"paper bag rapist\" by the Vancouver press (he wore a paper bag over his head when he raped children and women) . Oughton was diagnosed by a court psychiatrist as both a psy­ chopath-\"lacks a conscience, is manipulat ive, egocentric, un­ truthful, and lacks a capac ity for love\" -and a sexual sadist who \"gets sexual excitement by inflicting ps ychological pressur e on his victi ms .\" 1 2 93"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"WITH OUT CONS CIE NCE The Psychop ath as Wife Batterer In recent years public awareness and intolerance of domest ic violence have increa sed dramat ically, result ing in aggressive prosecu tion and court -ma ndated treat ment of off enders . Al­ though the causes and dynamics of wife battering are complex and involve myr iad economic, socia l, and psychological factors, there is some evidence that psychopaths constitute a significant propor tion of persistent batterers. In a recent study, we administ ered the Psychopathy Checklist to a sample of men taking part, either voluntarily or as par t of a sentence, in a treatment progra m for wife assault ers . 1 3 We found that 25 percent of the men in the sample were psychopaths, a percentage similar to that found in prison populati ons. We don't know the per centage of psychopathic wife assau lters who do not enter treatment progr ams, but I sus pect it is at least as high . The suggestion that many of the men who contin ually assault their wives are psychopaths has serious ramif ications for treat­ ment progr ams. This is bec ause the behavior of psychopaths is notoriously resistant to change (a topic I will discuss in a later chapt er) . The resour ces avai lable to run progra ms for assault ive hus bands usu ally are limited, and many treatment groups have long wait ing lists . Psyc hopaths, more than other men, are likely to attend these progr ams simply to appease the courts rather than to change their behavior, and they may do little more than occupy a seat that could be better used by someone else . Fur thermore, ps ychopaths undoubtedly have disrupt ing ef­ fects on such progr ams.

Charming and amia ble, he described the 94"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Crime: The Logical Cho ice assault as a very minor -and yes, even unfortunate-altercation in which he struck out in anger during an argument with his wife. The police report, howeve r, indic ated that he had black­ ened her eyes and broken her nose , and that this assault was only the latest in a string of similar episodes involving many other women . In an interview prior to the start of his first treat­ ment session he stated that he under stood the problem and that all he needed was to learn some anger-mana gement skills. He then proceeded to descri be, in a pontif icating way, the psy­ cholo gical dynamics and theories associated with family vio­ lence, and concl uded that it was unlik ely that the group could offer him much ; however, he was willing to attend the sessions because he could help the other men gain some insight into their problems. During the first session he casually commen ted that he had been a paratrooper in Vietnam , had received an MBA from Columb ia University, and h:id started several successful busi­ ness enterprises; details were sketchy. He said that his cur rent offense was his first, and when the group leader pointed out that he had also received convic tions for theft , fraud , and em­ bezzlement, he smile d and said that they were all the result of petty misunder standings. He domi nated the group discus sions and spent most of his efforts in rather superf icial, \"pop psych\" analyses of the other men. The group leader found him interesting, but most of the others were usually frustrated by his intelle ctual arrog ance and aggressive manner. After a few sessions he dropped out of the group, and reportedly left the city, in clear violation of the cour t order against him. His claims to be a graduate of Columbia University and to have served in Vietnam turned out be false. The Real Test: Can We Pre dict Their Beh avi or? In capital mur der cases in Texa s, forensic psychiatrist James Grigson, \"Dr. Dea th,\" routinely testifies that ps ychopathic mur - 95"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE derers are certa in to kill again. 14 As a result, there is no shortage of occu pants for the cells on death row . Gr igson' s certa int y is offset by the belief, held by man y clini­ cians and policy makers, that criminal behavior and violence ca nnot be predicted accurately. As usual, the truth lies somewhere between these extr emes . It doesn' t take a genius to realize that people who have a history of cr iminalit y or violence are more danger ous than others . A good predictor of what someone will do in the future is what he or she has done in the past, a maxim that provides the ba sis for many of the decisions made by the criminal justice system . Evidence from at least half a dozen recent studies clearly dem­ onstrates that predictions about crimi nal and violent behavior can be im proved consider ably if we also know whether the indi­ vidual is a psychopath, as defined by the Psychopathy Checklist . 1 5 These studies looked at the recidivism rates (commission of new off enses) of feder al offenders following their release from prison. These studies show that, on average : • The rec idivism rate of psychopaths is about dou ble that of other off enders . • The viol ent recidivism rate of psychopaths is about triple that of other off enders . An area of great concern to the public is the release on parole of sexual off enders . As I indicated earlier, it is important to dist inguish between sexual offenders who are psych opaths and those who are not. The importance of this dist inction for parole boards is highlighted by a recent study of rapists released from prison following an intensive treatment progr am. 1 6 Almost one­ third of the released men raped again . For the most part, the repeat rapists had a high score on the Psychopathy Checklist and had shown, prior to relea se, evidence of devia nt sexual arousal to depictions of violence, as measured by an elect ronic device placed around the pen is. When used to predict which released off enders would rape again, these two variable s--psychopathy and deviant arousal -were correct three times out of four.

Think about some relatives or friends you have known since childhood : the shy, inhibited girlfriend; the outgoing, grega rious brother; the fa st-t alking, sleazy cousin; the wild, host ile, aggres­ sive neighb or. What were they like when they were ten years old? Although people change, in some cases a great deal, many personalit y traits and behavioral patterns remain stable through­ out life . For exa mple, the boy who is afraid of his own shadow is more likely to become a timid, anxious adult than a tough and fea rless fighter. This is not to say that our personalit ies and behaviors become tightly fixed early in life, or that growth, maturation, and experience are not power ful forces in determin­ ing what sort of adults we will beco me. But ther e is a certain degree of continuity in how we interact with our envir onment. With respect to crimina lity, for example, several researchers have shown that the childhood traits of timidity, rest lessness, and aggre ssiveness are remarkably persistent, at least into early adultho od. 1 8 It is not surprising, then, that the ant isocial and criminal act iv­ ities of adult psychopaths are continuations of behavior patterns that first showed themselves in childhood . But something inter­ est ing happens at the other end of the spec trum: 1 9 • On average, the criminal act ivities of psychopaths remain at a high level unt il around age forty, after which they decr ease sharply. • This decrease is more dramat ic for nonviolent off enses than for violent on es. 97"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE What accounts for the decrea se in ant isocial behavior that many ps ychopaths show in middle age? Several plau sible expla­ na tio ns have been advanced: They \"burn out, \" mat ure, get tired of being in prison or in conflict with the law, develop new strate­ gies for bea ting the system, find someone who understands them, restructure their view of themselves and the world, and so on. But before concluding that aging psychopaths pose little threat to society, consider the following: • Not all ps ychopaths give up crime in middle age; many continue to commit offenses well into their senior yea rs. • A decrea se in criminalit y does not necessar ily mean that there has been a fundamental change in persona lity. These are important points . Some psychopaths continue to commit off enses, especially violent ones, unt il the day they die . And research suggests that many of those whose criminal activi­ ties do decrease with age still have much the same core person­ alit y traits as those des cribed in chap ter �that is, they remain egocent ric, shallow, manipulat ive, and callou s. The difference is that they have learned to satisfy their needs in ways that are not as grossly ant isocial as before . However, this does not mean that their behavior is now moral and ethic al. Th us, a woman whose \"ref ormed\" hus band now manages to stay out of trouble with the law, cheats on her less regularly than before, and expresses love for her, may well wonder if her man has \"really changed at all,\" pa rticularly if she seldom knows wh ere he is or what he is up to. If that man were a psychopath, I would very much doubt that he has chang ed. AT AGE THIR TY-FIVE, a diagno sed psychopath with a lengthy record of criminal beha vior and violence decided to turn her life around . She took a great many courses in prison and, following her release at age forty-two, obtained a university degree in counsel ing psychology.

Some people in the commun ity consider her a success 98"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Crime: The Logical Cho ice story. However, she has been dism issed from several jobs over the misuse of funds and making threats against her co-workers and supervisors. Because many people take the threats seri­ ously and because they fear that publi city about her activities would embarrass them and their organiza tions , they have not taken formal action against her. Some of those who know her think she is an interesting woman whose criminal past was the result of unfavorable social conditions and bad luck; others think she is much the same person she always was�al lous, arro­ gant , manipula tive, egocentric -with the only discernible differ­ ence being that she now manages to remai n out of contact with the law. A Per fect Scor e I will end this chapt er with a brief acc ount of an off ender whom two independent assess ors agreed should receive the maximum pos sible score on the Psychopa thy Checkl ist, a score given to fewer than one in two hun dred serious offend ers. Ear l was a forty-year-old serving a three-year sent ence for as­ sault. Both ass essors found the interview with him interes ting, even exciting, for he exuded a captivating ener gy that kept them on the edge of their seats. At the same time, they were shocked and repelled by what he had to say and by the casual, matter­ of-fact way in which he said it. As one of the asses sors put it, \"I was really fa scinat ed by this guy, but he was from another planet. He scared the shit out of me!\" Earl came from a stable working-cl ass family, the third of four childr en. His probl ems with society began early: In kindergarten he stabbed a teacher with a fork after she had forced him to sit in his seat; at age ten he was procuring young girls (including his twelve-year-old sist er) for sexual favors for his older friends; and at age thirteen he was convicted for stealing from his par­ ents and forging their names on checks . \"Yea h, I spent a few months in juvey [a juvenile detent ion center] , but I got away with a fucking lot more than they caught me for .\" Since then, there is very little Earl hasn't done, most of it to other peop le.

Even when convict ed, he typ ically managed to obtain early parole, seem­ ingly inexplicable in view of his behavior in prison. An en try in a psychological report tells the story: \"The most salient thing about Earl is his obsession with absolut e power. . . . He values people only insof ar as they bend to his will or can be coerced or manipulated into doing what he wants . He constantly sizes up his prospects for exploiting people and situations .\" Other prison files describe how, in his quest for power and control, he walks a fine line between inmates and staf f and is both feared an d admir ed by both sid es. He is very skilled in the use of threats, intimidation, muscle, bribery, and drugs, and he \"regularly informs on other inmates in an effort to save his ass and to obta in privileg es. The con code means nothing to him unless he personally gets something out of it.\" His relations with women are as shallow and ·predatory as the rest of his behavior. He attests to having had several hund red live-in relat ionships, ranging from days to weeks, and an inest i­ mable nu mber of sexual contacts over the yea rs . When asked how many children he has, Earl replied, \"I don' t really know . A few, I gu ess. I've been accused of being the father, but I'd say, 'Fuck yo u! How do I know it's mine?' \" He routinely terror­ ized and assa ulted the women in his life, sexually abused his daught er, and raped her girlfr iend. His propensities for sadist ic sexual behavior carry over into prison, where he is well known for his \"ag gressive homosexualit y.\" One of the most striking features of Ear l's personalit y is his gra ndiosit y; entries scattered through his files mak e reference to his dramat ic, inflated, and pompous way of commu nica ting. As one of my assess ors wrote, \"If I hadn't been so afraid of him I would have laughed in his face at his blatant self-wors hip.\" As Earl put it, \"I'm always being told by others how great I am and how ther e's nothing I ca n't do-sometimes I think they' re 1.00"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Crime: The Logical Choice just shitt ing me, but a man's got to believe in himse lf, right?

But, as one of my interviewers said, \"If even half of what he told me is true, he should never be let out.\" Earl was aware that our assessments were strictly conf identi al, conducted as par t of a resea rch proj ect in which we were legally and ethically prevented from commu nica ting our findings to the institut ional au thorities unless he actually threatened to har m himself or others . His persona with us there­ fore was more open than was the one he displayed in prepara­ tion for his parole ap plica tion.

He was aided by the common expectation that certa in cla sses of people presumably are trustworthy beca use of their social or prof essional creden­ tia ls. For example, lawyers, physic ians, teachers, polit icia ns, counselors, and so forth, genera lly do not have to work to ear n our trust; they have it by virtue of their posit ions . Our guard may go up when we deal with a used�car salesman or a tele­ phone solicitor, but we often blindly entrust our assets and well­ being to a lawyer, doctor, or investment counselor. In most cases our trust is not misplaced, but the very fact that we are so willing to give it makes us easy prey for every opportunistic shark we enc ounter. Most dangerous of all-the \"Jaws\" of the trust-mongers -are psychop aths. Having obta ined our trust, they betray it with stunning callou sne ss.

However, two months lat er he was picked up for attempt ing to cross the border in his mot her ' s car (taken without her permission), and his par ole was revoked . In our inter views, Brad came across as very pleasant and con­ vincing . As for his victims, he said that nobody was really hurt: \"The Law Society has a fund to cover these thin gs.

GIVEN THEIR PERSONALITY , it comes as no surpris e that psy­ chopaths make good imposters. They have no hesitation in forg­ ing and braze nly using impressive cre dentials to adopt, chamele onlike, profe ssional roles that give them prestige and powe r. When things begin to fall apart, as they usually do, they simply pack up and move on. In most cases they select profess ions in which the requisite skills are easy to fake, the jargon is easy to learn , and the cred entials are unlik ely to be thoroughly checked . If the profes­ sion also places a high prem ium on the ability to persuade or manipula te others , or to \"lay on the hands ,\" so much the better. Thus, psychopaths find it easy to pose as financial consu ltants, minis ters, counselors, and psychologis ts. But some of their other poses are much more difficult to pull off.

When questions began to be asked about his sexual relations with his patients, his medic al proced ures , and several botched opera­ tions, he simply disappeared, leaving behind an embarrassed medical commun ity and a numb er of physical ly and emotionally damaged patients. A few years later he turned up in England, where he was arrested and jailed for posing as a psychiatrist. At his trial it was learned that at various times he had posed as a social worke r, a police officer, an under cover customs agent, and a psychologist spec ializing in marital prob lems.

Targeting the Vulnerable The idea that a psychopath could actually hang up a shi ngle as a lawyer or an investment counselor is not very comfort ing. But even more unse ttling are the coldly calculated violat ions of power and trust committed by a small number of prof essi ona ls­ doct ors, psychiatrists, psycholog ists, teachers, counselors, child­ care workers- whose very job it is to help the vulner ab le. In The Mask of San ity, for example, Hervey Cleckley vividly desc ribed a psychopathic physician and psychiatr ist. He noted that the real difference between them and the psychopaths who end up in jail or in psychiatric hospitals is that they simply manage to keep up a better and more consistent appear ance of normalit y. However, their cloak of respectabili ty is thin and uncomf ortable and easily shed, often to the dismay of their unf ortunate pa­ tients .

The net effect in the typical case is that of a Ping Pong ball out of contr ol. However, many psychopaths never go to prison or any other facility. They appear to function reasonably well-a s lawyers, doctors, psychiatrists, academics, mercenaries, police officers, cult leaders, militar y personnel, businesspeople, writers, artists, en­ tertainers, and so forth- without breaking the law, or at least without being caught and convict ed. These indi viduals are every bit as egocentric, callous, and manipulat ive as the average crimi­ nal psyc hopath; however, their intelligence, family backgr ound, social skills, and cir cumst ances permit them to con struct a fa cade of normalcy and to get what they want with relative impunity.

And even when ex­ posed, they can carry on as if nothing has happened, often leaving their accusers bewildered and uncertain about their own positi ons . Finally, white-collar crime is lucrative, the chances of getting caught are minimal, and the penalties are often trivia l. Think of the insider tra ders, junk-bond kings, and S & L sharks whose financial depr eda tions were so spectacula rly rewarding --even when they were caug ht. In many cases, the ru les of the game for greed and fraud carried out on a grand scale are not the same as they are for ordinar y cri me.

When I inquir ed why it would be useful for him to know whether Mr. Y was a psychopa th, the attorney replied that it could be crucial to his case because, as everyone knows , psy­ chopaths are notoriously deceitfu l, unreliab le, and eager to save their own skin at any cost.

What makes psyc hopaths different from all others is the remarkable ease with which they lie, the per va­ sive ness of their deception, and the callousness with wh ich they carry it out. But there is something else ab out the speech of psyc hopaths that is equally puzzling: their frequent use of contrad ictory and logically inconsistent statements that usually escape detect ion.

It is as if psyc hopaths sometimes have difficulty in monitor ing their own speech, and they let loose with a convoluted ba rrage of poorly connected words and thoug hts . Psych opaths also sometimes put words together in stra nge ways . For example, consider the following exchange between a journalist and psychopathic serial killer, Clif ford Olson . \"And then I had annu al sex with he r.\" \"Once a year?\" \"No . Annu al. From behind .\" \"Oh. But she was dead !\" \"No, no.

In most people the two sides of the brain have diff erent, spe­ cialized funct ions. The lef t cerebral hemisphere is skilled at processing infor mation ana lytically and sequentially, and it plays a crucial role in the understanding and use of language . The right hemisphere proce sses inf ormation simulta neously, as a whole; it plays an important role in the per ception of spatial relati ons, imager y, emot ional experience, and the processing of music . Nature probably \"arranged\" for each side of the brain to have different functions for the sake of efficiency. 4 For example, it is clearly more effective for all the complex mental oper ations re­ quired to use and understand language to take place in one side of the brain than if they were dist ributed over both sides . In the latter case, information would have to be sent back and forth between the two hemispheres, which would slow down the processing rate and increa se the chances of err or. Further, some par t of the brain has to have pr imar y control over the task; if the two sides of the brain were com pet ing for 127"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE this control, the conf lict would reduce the efficiency of proc essing. Some forms of dyslex ia and stuttering, for example, are associated with just such a condit ion: La nguage centers are bilater al-located in both hemispher es. Comp etition between the two hemisphe res makes for a variety of difficulties in the under ­ standing and produ ction of language . New experimental evidence suggests that bilateral language proce sses are also cha racter istic of psyc hopathy. 5 This leads me to speculate that part of the tende ncy for ps ychopaths to make contradi ctory statements is related to an inefficient \"line of au­ thority\"--each hemisph ere tries to run the show, with the result that speech is poorly integrated and monitored . Of course, others with bilateral languag e-some stut terers, dyslexics, and left-handers -do not lie and contradict them­ selves the way ps yc hopaths do . Clear ly, somet hing else must be involv ed. Hol low Words Most people who have had extensive experience with psycho­ paths have an intuitive sense of what that difference might be. \"He was always telling me how much he loved me, and at first I believed him, even after I caught him fooling around with my sister,\" said the estranged wife of one of our psychopathic sub­ jects . \"It took me a long time to realize that he didn't care for me at all . Every time he beat up on me he would say, 'I'm really sorry, pigeon. You know I love you .' Right out of a cheap movie!\" This would come as no surprise to clinicia ns, long awar e that psyc hopaths seem to know the dictionary mea nings of words but fail to comp r ehend or ap preciate their emotional value or signif icance . Consider the following quotes from the clinical lit­ erature on ps yc hopathy: • \"He knows the words but not the musi c.\" 6 • \"Ideas of mutualit y of shar ing and understanding are be­ yond his under standing in an emotional sense; he knows only the book mea ning of wor ds. \" 7 1.28"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Words from an Overcoat Pocket • \"[He] exhibits a facility with words that mean little to him, form without substance . . . . His seemin gly good judgment and social sense are only word deep .\" 8 . These clinical observa tions get right to the heart of the mys­ tery of psychopathy: language that is two-d imensiona l, lacking in emotional depth . A simple ana logy here will he lp. The ps ychopath is like a color-blind person who sees the world in shades of gray but who has learned how to function in a colored world . He has learned that the light signal for \"stop\" is at the top of the traffic signa l. When the color-blind person tells you he stopped at the red light, he really means he stopped at the top lig ht. He has difficulty in discussing the color of things but may have learned all sorts of ways to com pensate for this probl em, and in some cases even those who know him well may not know that he cannot see colors . Like the color-blind person, the ps ychopath lacks an impor­ tant element of experience-in this case, emotional exper ien ce­ but may have learned the words that others use to descr ibe or mimic experiences that he cannot really understa nd . As Cl eckley put it, \"He can learn to use ordinary words ... [and] will also learn to reproduce appropriately all the pantomime of feeling . . . but the feeling itself does not come to pass .\" 9 Recent laboratory resear ch provides convincing sup port for these clinical observa tio ns. This resear ch is based on evidence that, for normal people, neutral words generally convey less information than do emot ional wor ds: A word such as PAPER has dictionary meaning, whereas a word such as DE ATH has dictionary meaning plus emotional meaning and unpleasant con­ notati ons . Emotional words have more \"pu nch\" than do other wor ds. Picture yourself sitting before a computer screen on which groups of letters are fla shed for a fraction of a sec ond . Electrodes for recording brain responses have been attached to your scalp and connected to an EEG machine, which draws a graph of the electrical activity of the brain. Some of the groups of letters flashed on the screen form common words found in the diction­ ary; other strings form no words, only nonsense syllable s.

Your task is to push a button as quickly as pos sible whenever you have decided that a true word appear ed on the scr een . The computer measures the time it takes you to make your decision; it also anal yzes your brain responses dur ing the task. You will probably respond more quickly to an emotional word than to a neutral one. For example, you-and most other peo­ ple - would push the button more quickly at the word DEATH than at the word PAPER. The emotional content of a word seems to give a sort of \"turbo-boost\" to the decision-making proc ess. At the same time, the emotional words evoke larger brain respon ses than do neut ral words, a reflection of the rela­ tively lar ge amount of information conta ined in the emotional wor ds. A PSYCHOPA THIC KILLER, asked by a female intervie wer to explai n the motiva tions for his crimes, instead launched into a graphic desc ription of several particularly brutal murders and mutilations for which he had been imprisone d.

However, because of their sparse emotional life they don't intuitively realize the impact on others of what they say. They use their listeners ' react ions as \"cue cards\" to tell them how they are supposed to feel in the situat ion. When we used this laboratory task with prison inmates, the nonpsychopaths showed the normal pa ttern of responses ­ quicker decisions and lar ger brain responses to emotional than to neutral words-but the psychopaths did not: They responded to emoti onal words as if they were neu tral words. 1 0 This dramatic finding provided strong supp ort for the argument that words do not have the same emot ional or affective coloring for psycho- 130"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Words from an Overcoat Pocket paths as they do for other people . Some of our more recent research provides additional suppor t for this thesis, conf irming that, for what ever reason, ps ych opaths lack some of the \"feela­ ble\" components of language . 11 This deficiency has fascinating impli ca tio ns, espe cially when considered in the context of ps yc hopaths' social interactions­ manipula tive deceit unin hibited by empathy or conscience . For most of us, languag e has the capac ity to elicit power ful emo­ tional feelings . For example, the word cancer evokes not only a clinical desc ription of a disease and its sym ptoms but a sense of fear, apprehension, or concern, and perhaps distur bing mental images of what it might be like to have it. But to the ps ycho path, a word is just a word . Brain-imaging techno logy offers the prospect of gaining excit­ ing new insig hts into the emotional life of psychopa ths. In a colla borative research project at the Mt. Sinai and Bronx VA Medic al Centers in New York , led by psychiatrist Joanne Intra­ tor, we recently began to obtain brain-images from psyc ho­ pathic and normal individuals while they performed a variety of tasks. Our preliminary findings from a pilot project (presented at the annual meeti ngs of the Society for Biologic al Psychiatry and the Americ an Psychiatric Association in San Francis co, May, 1993), sugg est that psychopaths may not use the same areas of the brain that normal individuals do when they process emotional words. If these results can be re plicated and ex­ tended to other forms of emotional informat ion, they would sug­ gest that psychopaths differ from others either in the strateg ies they use to process emotional material or in the way their brain processes are organ ized. In either case , we would be consider­ ably closer than we are now to under standing the mystery of the psychopath . In a book explaining her side of the shoot ing of her three children, Diane Downs described her causal relat ionships with a score of men as love less, mot ivated only by sex. 12 In letters sent to Robert Bertaluc cini (\"Bert\" ), a fellow letter carrier, she wrote of her \"pr omises of undying love, endless devotion and 131"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE oaths that no one else on ea rth would ever touch me. It was the game I played with men . And I played it best with Ber t.\" [p. 144] After shoot ing her children she had an affair with Jason Redding, and wrote, \"But Bert was in the past , and Jason was in the present. True, I was writing letters to Bert telling him how much I loved him, that he was the only man on earth for me .... When he began to refu se the let ters, I started saving them in a notebook, mak ing an entry each night, most of them a par agra ph or two, a page at most. The entries were the same, just with different wording: 'I love you Bert, why aren' t you here, I need you, you're the only man for me .' ... I mixed a drink and wrote my hol low words of love to Bert as I sank into a hot bubble bath .... I thought about Bert .... Minutes later Jason knocked at the door, and as I flew down the stairs to meet him, my thought s of Bert flew as well .\" [pp. 36-- 37] Di ane's \"hollow words of love\" were a sou rce of pride to her, as if their use was ent irely intenti onal, desi gned for a par ticular purpose . However, like all ps yc hopaths, her words of love could not be any­ thing but hollow, for she lacks the capa city to impart real feeling to them . Earlier I discussed the role of \"inner speech\" in the develop­ ment and oper ation of consc ience . It is the emotionall y char ged thoughts, images, and internal dialogue that give the \"bite\" to conscience, acco unt for its power ful control over behavior, and generate guilt and remorse for transgr essio ns. This is something that psychopaths cannot u nderst and. For them, conscience is little more than an intellectual awareness of rules others make up -empt y wor ds. The feelings needed to give clout to these rules are missing. The quest ion is, why? C ANADA's MOST NOTORIOUS and reviled criminal is Clifford Olson, a serial murderer sentenced in January 1982 to life im­ prisonment for the torture and killing of eleven boys and girls. These crimes were the latest and most despicable in a string of antisocial and criminal acts extending back to his early child­ hood . Although some psychopaths are not violent and few are as brutal as he, Olson is the prototypical psychopa th. Consider the following quotations from a newspaper article written around the time of his trial: \"He was a braggart t32"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Words from an Overcoat Pocket and a bully, a liar and a thief. He was a violent man with a hairtrigger temper. But he could also be charm ing and smooth-tong ued when trying to impr ess people . . . Olson was a compuls ive talker ... He's a real smooth talker, he has the gift of gab . . . He was always telling whoppers ... The man was just an out-and-out liar ... He always wanted to test you to the limits. He wanted to see how far he could go before you had to step on him ... He was a manipu lator ... Olson was a blabbermouth ... We learned after a while not to believe anyth ing he said because he told so many lies.\" [Far­ row, 1982] A reporter who talked with Olson said, \"He talked fast, staccato ... He jump ed from topic to to pic. He sounded glib, slick, like a con tr ying to prove he's tough and important .\" [Oust on, 1982] These reports by people who knew him are importan t, for they give us a clue to why he was able to get his young, trusting victims alone with him. They may also help to explain the Crown 's decision to pay him $100,000 to tell them wher e he hid the bodies of seven of the eleven young people he had killed. Not surpris ingly, public outrage greeted disclosure of the payment. Some typical headlines were : KILLER WAS PAID TO LO­ CATE BODIE S; MON EY-FOR-GR AVES PAYMENT TO CHILD KILLER GREETED WITH DISGUST. In the years since his imprisonment Olson has conti nued to bring grief to the families of his victims by send ing them letters with comme nts about the murders of their childr en. He has never shown any guilt or remorse for his depreda tions; on the contrary, he contin ually complains about his treatment by the press, the prison system, and society . During his trial he preened and postured whenever a camera was prese nt, appar­ ently consideri ng himself an important celebrity rather than a man who had comm itted a series of atrocities. On January 15, 1983, the Vancouver Sun reported, \"Mass killer Clifford Olson has written to the Sun newsroom to say he does not approve of the pictur e of him we have been using ... and will shortly be sending us newer, more attractive pictures of himsel f.''

Below the Emot ional Poverty Line If the language of psychopaths is bila tera l-co ntrolled by both sides of the brain -it is pos sible that other brain pro­ cesses normally controlled by one hemisphere are also under bilateral contr ol. Indeed, alt hough in most people the right side of the brain plays a central role in emotion, recent labora­ tor y evidence indicates that in psychopaths neither side of the brain is proficient in the proce sses of emot ion. 13 Why this is so is still a mys tery . But an intriguing implication is that the brain proc esses that control the ps ycho pat h's emotions are divided and unfocused, resulting in a shallow and color less emotional lif e . Ted Bundy may have been indignant when someone referred to him as an emot ional robot with nothing insi de. \"Boy, how far off can he be !\" said Bundy. \"If they think I have no emo­ tional life, they're wro ng. Absolutely wrong. It's a very real one and a full on e.\" 14 However, it is abunda ntly clear from his other comments and the shallow explanations for his murderous be­ havior that the description is apt. Like all psychopaths, Bundy had only a vague comprehension of the extent of his emotional poverty . Many people are attracted to pop-ps ych movements that em­ pha size a search for self-understanding -\"getting in touch with your feelings .\" For psychopaths, the exercise-like the sear ch for the Holy Grail -is doomed to fai lure . In the final analysis, their self-i mage is defined more by poss essions and other visible signs of success and power than by love, insight, and com pas­ sion, which are abstractions and have little inherent meaning for them . 134"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Words from an Overcoat Pocket Watch Their Han ds Watch the way someone talking to you moves his or her han ds: Do they move infrequently or do they fly all over the place?

Beats may also tell us something about the size of the \"thought unit s,\" or mental pack ages, that underlie spe ech .

The idea s, words, phr ases, and sentences that comprise large thought units are likely to be well integra ted, tied tog ether in some mea ningfu l, consistent, or logical fa shion to form a scr ipt. Beats appear to \"mark off\" these thought units : The greater the number of beats, the smaller the units . Recent evidence suggests that ps yc hopaths use more beats than do normal people, pa rticularly when they ta lk about things generally considered emoti onal -for ex ample, describing the way they feel about family members or other \"loved ones .\" 16 We might inf er two things from this evidence : • Like a touri st using high-school French to ask directions in Par is, psychopaths have trouble putting int o words emotional ideas beca use they are vague and poorly understood . In this sense, emotion is like a second language to the psychopa th . • Psych opaths' thoughts and ideas are organized into rather small mental packages and readily moved aro und. This can be a distinct advant age when it comes to lying. As psychologist Paul Ekman pointed out, skilled liars are able to break down ideas, conc epts, and language into basic components and then recombine them in a variety of ways, almost as if they were playing Scrabbl e. 17 But in doing so, the psyc hopat h enda ngers his overall scri pt; it may lose its unifying structure or become less coherent and integrated than if he were dealing in large thought units . For this reason, the competent liar often uses a thin \"tru th line\" to help keep track of what he says and to ens ure that his story appears consistent to the listener. \"The most mischievous liars are those who keep sliding on the verge of truth .\" 18 A Fra gmented Truth Line Although psych opaths lie a lot, they are not the skilled liars we often make them out to be . As I discussed ea rlier, their speech is full of inconsistent or contradictory statements . Psy­ chopaths may play mental Scrabble, but they sometimes do it 1.36"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Words from an Overcoat Pocket badly bec ause they fail to int egrate the pieces into a co herent whole; their truth line is fragmented and patchy, at best . Consider the inmate quoted earlier who said he had never been violent but once had to kill some one. We understand this as a contradictory statement beca use we treat it as a single thought unit. However, the inmate may have been dealing with two independent thought units : \"I never committed a violent off ense, \" and, \"I once killed someone .\" Most of us are able to combine ideas so that they are consistent with some under lying theme, but psychopaths seem to have difficulty doing so. This helps to explain the wild inconsistencies and contradictions that frequently cha racter ize their speech . It may also account for their use of neologisms (comb ina tion of the basic components of words-syllables-in ways that seem logical to them but inap­ propriate to other s). The situation is anal og ous to a movie in which one scene is shot under cloudy conditions and the next scene-which sup­ posedly takes place a few minutes later-is shot in brilliant sun­ shine . Obvi ously the scenes were shot on different days, and the director fa iled to take this into account when put ting them togeth er. Some moviegoers-like some victims of ps ych opath s­ might not notice the discrepa ncy, pa rticularly if they are en­ grossed in the act ion. One other point about the way in which ps ychopaths use language : Their \"mental packages\" are not only small but two­ dimensiona l, devoid of emotional meaning. For most people, the choice of words is determined by both their dict ionar y mean­ ing and their emotional connota tion s. But psychopaths need not be so selective; their words are unencum bered by emot iona l bag­ gage and can be used in ways that seem odd to the rest of us. For example, a ps ychopath may see nothing wrong in saying to a woman, \"I love yo u,\" just after bea ting her up, or in telling someone else, \"I needed to beat her up to keep her in line, but she knows I love he r.\" For most people these two events (state­ ment of love, ass ault) would be logically and affectively incongru ous. Consider this bizarre statement by a man with a high score on the Psychopathy Checkl ist who served three years in pr ison for fraud and thef t-he tricked his widowed mother into ob taining 1.37"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIENCE a $25 ,000 mortgage on her house, stole the money, and left her to pay off the debt from her meager income as a store clerk: \"My mother is a great person, but I worry about her.

When this was pointed out to him he said, \"Well, ye ah, I love my mother but she' s pretty old and if I don't look out for myself , who will?\" Wh ere Wa s I? It now app ears that the communications of psyc hopaths some­ times are subtly odd and part of a general tendency to \"go off track .\" 19 That is, they frequently cha nge topics, go off on irrele­ vant tangents, and fail to connect phrases and sentences in a straigh tforward manner. The story line, though somewhat dis­ jointed, may seem acceptable to the casual list en er.

However, the videotape of the interview clearly revea led to ever yone­ including our embarra ssed interviewer -that the man not only had gone off track but had trapped her into a flirtat ious exchange . Psyc hopaths are notor ious for not an swering the quest ion posed them or for answ ering in a way that seems unresponsive to the quest ion. For ex ample, one ps ychopath in our research, asked if his moods went up and down, replied, \"U h-up and down?-we ll, you know-some people say they are always ner­ vous but sometimes they seem pretty calm . I guess their moods go up and down. I remember once-uh-I was feeling low and-my buddy came over and we watched the ga me on TV and-uh-we had a bet on an d he won-and I felt prett y shitt y.\" Psyc hopaths also sometimes make it difficult for their listeners to understand parts of their narrative . \"I met these guys in a ba r. One guy was a dealer and the other was a pimp . They started to hassle me an d I punched him out, \" said one of our psyc hopat hs. But was it the dealer or the pimp who was \"pun ched out\" ? Of course, minor breakdowns in com mun ication are not un­ common in normal people; in many cases they repr esent little more than care lessness or a momentar y lapse in concentra tion. But in psyc hopaths the breakdowns are more frequent, more ser ious, and possibly indi cative of an und erlying condition in which the organization of mental act ivit y- but not its content­ is defect ive . It is how they string words and sent ences together, not what they ac tually say, that suggests abno rmalit y . By way of contra st, both the form and the content of schizophrenic com­ munications are characteristically odd and bizar re. For example, one of our subj ects, who later received a diagnosis of schizo­ phrenia , replied to the question, \"Do your moods go up and down?\" as follows: I'm just such a-believer that-uh-that life is so short and that we're here for such a short time and so-so we're all going to die anyway at one stage so then-uh-you-we­ pass on to a totally n ew strata and all the problems of this t39"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSC IENCE world for us are solved and then we have a new set of problems and a new set of joys-whichever one-uh-it' s not something I claim to un derst and .

We can infer some sort of meaning more readily from his reply than we can from the schizophr enic' s reply . It is well known that psychopaths often convincingly malin­ ger-fake mental illness -when it is to their adva ntage to do so. For example, an inmat e I described earlier was able to con his way into a ps ychiat ric unit-and back out again -by sla nting his responses to the questions on a widely used ps ychological test. A FEW YEARS ago I was asked to consult on a Hollywood feature film about a psychopathic serial killer. The filmmakers had great concern for accuracy and had researched the subject as thoroughly as they were able. But the scriptwriter phone d me one day in near despera tion. \"How can I make my character interesting ?\" he asked . \"When I try to get into his head , try to work out his motiva tions , desires, and hang ups in a way that will make some sort of sense to the audience, I draw a blank. These guys [the two psychopaths in the story] are too much alike, and there doesn't seem to be much of interest below the surface .\" In a sense the screenwriter had nailed it: As portrayed in film and story, psychopaths do tend to be two-d imens ional charac­ ters without the emotiona l depth and the complex and confusing drives, confl icts, and psychologic al turmoil that make even ordi­ nary people interesting and different from one anoth er.

To a certain extent, these media depic tions may reflect reality. 140"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Words from an Overcoat Pocket Virtually all investigations into the psychopath 's inner world paint an arid picture . The philosophy of life that these individuals es­ pouse usually is banal , sophomoric, and devo id of the detail that enriches the lives of normal adults. A particularly revealing illustration of the psychopath's ability to manipulate experienced psychiatrists and psychologists is pro­ vided in Terry Ganey's book about Charles Hatcher, who killed at least sixteen people because it gave him a thrill . 20 Following a charge for murdering a six-year-old boy, he was shuttled back and forth between the courts and a forensic psychiatric hospit al. Psychiatrists appointed by the court determined that Hatcher was incompetent to stand trial, but the psychiatrists at the hospital considered him competent to stand trial. And so it went, back and forth . After a seemingly endless series of contradictory psychiatric evaluations, Hatcher tired of the game and turned his talents to outmaneuvering the lawyers and the courts. However, the evidence presented in this chapter suggests that it may not only be the psychopat h's. skill at manipulation that sometimes makes it difficult for clinicians to evaluate his or her sanity. An interview in which a psychopath's statements are con­ tradictory, tangential, or poorly connected to one another is bound to influence astute clinical judgment. For example, the trial of John Wayne Gacy, the Chicago businessman and serial killer who per­ formed as Pogo the down for sick children, was marked by contra­ dictory psychiatric testimony. 2 1 Prosecution experts argued that he was a psychopath and sane, whereas defense experts said that he was psychotic or insane. One psychologist said that he was a psychopathic or antisocial personality with sexual deviation, and that during interviews Gacy's statements were marked by contra­ dictions, evasiveness, and rationalizations and excuses. A psychia­ trist noted that Gacy just liked to talk. Under cross-examination the psychiatrist was asked \"if Gacy' s effusive stream of talk didn' t demonstrate loose associations, a characteristic of schizo phrenia . 'When Mr. Gacy says on one hand ... he killed someone and on the next hand he says he didn't do it, is that loose association?' \" The psychiatrist replied, \"I think that' s lying. I think he doesn't remember what he says from one day to the next because he lies .\" 1.41."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCI ENCE [p. 338] The jury rejected Gacy's insanity plea and recommended the death sentence. Gacy' s \"loose as sociations\" and his contradictory statements and lies may reflect little more than mental carel essness, lack of interest in keeping things straight for the listener, or part of a strategy intended to confu se the listener. However, in the con­ text of the material pr esented in this chapt er, they also may stem from a condit ion in which continuity among mental events and the self-monitoring of speech are defective, perhaps even disorder ed: mental Scrabble without an overall scri pt. This raises an important issue: If their speech is sometimes pecu­ liar, why are psychopaths so believable, so capable of deceiving and manipulating us? Why do we fail to pick up the inconsisten­ cies in what they say? The short answer is, it is difficult to pene­ trate their mask of normalcy: The oddities in their speech are often too subtle for the casual observer to detect, and they put on a good show . We are sucked in not by what they say but by how they say it and by the emotional buttons they push while saying it. DURING A TALK I recently gave at a university in California, a lingui st in the audience suggested that in some respects psycho­ paths resemble skilled story-te llers. Both use exaggerated body language and twists and turns in the plot that engage and hold the interest of listeners and \"bring them into the story.\" For many listeners the performance is at least as important as the story. The linguist sugg ested that, in this sense, psychopaths are effec­ tive story-t ellers. Even so, the scripts followed by story-tellers gen­ erally are more coherent and logically consistent than are those used by psychopaths. Further, the goals of story-tellers include entertai nment and educa tion, whereas those of psychopaths con­ sist of little more than power and self-g ratificati on. Does Thi s Mea n They're Crazy?

Following a lecture I gave on psychopathy an d language at a psychiatric conference in Flor ida, a forensic ps ychiatr ist ap­ proached me and said, \"Your resea rch implies that psyc hopaths may be mentally disordered, per haps not as respon sible for their behavior as we once thoug ht. Until now, a diagnosis of psy­ chopathy has been 'the kiss of death' for many mur dere rs. Will it now become the 'kiss of life' for them?\" An interesting quest ion . As I ment ioned earlier, psyc hopaths do meet current legal and psychiatric standards for sanit y. They understa nd the rules of society and the convent ional mea nings of right and wrong. They are capable of controlling their behav­ ior, and they are awar e of the potential consequences of their acts . Their problem is that this knowledge frequently fails to deter them from ant isocial behavior. Still, some observers argue, psyc hopaths are deficient in the mental and emotional mecha nisms needed to tra nsla te their knowledge of the ru les into behavior ac ceptable to society . If they have fa iled to develop a conscience, are unable to experi­ ence guilt or remorse, and have difficulty in monit oring their behavior and its effects on others, the argument ru ns, then surely they are at a ser ious disadva ntage compared to the rest of us. They understand the intellectual rules of the game but the emotional rules are lost to them . This modern version of the old conce pt of \"moral insanit y\" may make some theoretical sense, but it is not relevant to practical decisions about criminal responsibi lity .

In some ca ses, the individual simply ref uses to believe that he or she really is being taken adva ntage of. For example, the hus ba nd of one of our female psyc hopaths veheme ntly denied the credibility of reports from frie nds that his wife was cheating on him . He re­ mained convinced of her virtue even after she ran off with an­ other man. Psychological denial is an important mechanism for screening out painf ul knowledg e from conscio us awar ene ss, but it can also blind us to truths that are obvious to others .

Three overla pping subcategories are listed : • atten tion -deficit hyper activit y disorder, cha racterized by de­ velopmentally inappr opriate degrees of inattention, im­ pulsivene ss, and hyper activity • conduct disorder, a persistent pa ttern of conduct in which the basic rights of <? thers and maj or age-a ppr opriate soci­ etal norms or rules are violated • oppos itional defia nt disorder, a pa ttern of negative, host ile, and def iant behavior without the ser ious violations of the basic rights of others that are seen in conduct disorder None of these diagnos tic categories quit e hits the mark with young psyc hopaths .

Nature Evidence of the genetic and biological bases of temperament, the abilit y of some forms of bra in damag e to produce psycho­ pa thiclike symp tom s, and the early appear an ce of psychopathic behaviors in children provide frameworks for several biological theories on the orig ins of psychopathy . • The relatively new discipline of sociobiology argues that psy­ chopathy is not so much a ps ychiatric disorder as an expression of a pa rticular genetically based reproductive strategy . 8 Simply, sociobiologists as sert that one of our main roles in life is to reproduce, thereby passing on our genes to the next generati on . We ca n do so in a number of ways . One reproductive \"strategy\" is to have only a few children and to nurture them carefully, thus ens uring that they have a good chance of surviva l. A differ­ ent stra tegy is to have so many children that some are bound to sur vive, even if they are neglected or aba ndon ed. Psyc hopaths suppo sedly adhere to an extreme version of the latter strategy: They reproduce as often as poss ible and waste little energy in worrying about the welf are of their offspring. In this way, they propagate their genes with little or no personal invest ment. For male ps yc hopaths, the most effective way to have lots of children is to mat e with-and quickly abandon-a large number of wo men.

Terry is a first-time offender, serving two years for a series of robberies comm itted a year ago. He is also a psychopath . By all acco unts, his family life was stable, his parents were warm and loving, and his opportu nities for success were enor­ mous. His brothers were hone st and hardworki ng, whereas he simply \"floated through life, taking whatever was offered .\" His parents' hopes and expecta tions were less important to him than having a good time. Still, they supported him emotionally and financially through an adolescence marked by wildness, testing the limits, and repeated brushes with the law-spe eding , reckless driving, drunkenne ss-but no formal convic tions. By age twenty he had fathered two children and was heavily in­ volved in gambling and drugs. When he could no longer obtai n money from his family he turned to robbing banks, and was soon caught and sent to prison. \"I wouldn't be here if my parents had come across when I needed them ,\" he said. \"What kind of parents would let their son rot in a place like this? \" Asked about his childr en, he repl ied, \"I've never seen them.

But most of the em pirical sup­ por t for these theor ies comes from retr ospec tive reports of early experiences, certainly not the most reliable sour ce of scientific data . 16 Moreover, there is little evidenc e that early attachment diff iculties have anything to do with the development of psyc hopathy. Most of the external factors ass ociated with the \"failure to bond\" -rej ection, de priva tion, neglect, abuse, and so forth--can indeed produce terrible effects, and some of these effects may resemble a few of the traits and behaviors that def ine the disor­ der of psychopat hy.

While some assert that psychopathy is the result of attachment diff iculties in infancy, I turn the argument around : In some chil­ dren the very failure to bond is a symptom of psychopathy.

An Interac tive Mod el: Nature and Nurture The po sition I favor is that psychopathy emerges from a com­ plex-and poorly underst ood-interplay between biological fac­ tors and social force s. It is based on evidence tha t genet ic factors contribute to the biological bases of brain function and to basic personality structure, wh ich in tum inf lue nce the way the indi­ vidual responds to, and interacts with, life experiences and the socia l envir onment. 17 In effect, the elements needed for the de­ velopment of psychopa thy-including a prof ound inability to experience empathy and the complete range of emotions, in­ cluding fear-are provided in par t by nature and pos sibly by some unknown biological inf luences on the developing fetus and neona te . As a result, the capac ity for developing internal contr ols and conscience and for making emot ional \"conne c­ tions\" with others is greatly reduc ed. This doesn't mean that psych opaths are dest ined to develop along a fixed track, born to play a socially deviant role in life . But it does mean that their biological endowment -the raw ma­ ter ial that environmental, social, and learning experiences fa sh­ ion into a unique individ ual -provides a poor basis for socia liza tion and conscience forma tion. To use a simple analogy, the potter is instrumental in molding pottery from clay (nur­ ture ), but the characteristics of the potter y also depend on the sort of clay avail able (natur e). 1 8 Although psychopathy is not prima rily the result of poor par ­ enting or ad verse childhood exper iences, I think they play an important role in shaping what nature has provid ed .

Another individual, with much the same personality traits but from a deprived and disturbed background, might be­ come a drifter, mercenary, or violent crimi na l.

It's then up to the board to decide how to use the informa tion. If he's a psychopath and they let him out and he kills someone, we're off the hook and the parole board has to do the explaining to the public and the victim's family. If he's not a psychopath and all the other evidence indicated he was a good risk and he kills someone, we're still okay. So is the parole board. We all did the best we could, and no parole is without risk.\" The psychologist also said that it was only a matter of time until the family of someone killed by a parolee sued the state on the grounds that it had released \"a psychopathic killer who had not been properly diagnosed.\" The Psychopath y Checkl ist, he said, was useful insur ance against such a claim.

Clea rly this man is a repeat off ender, \" the chair ma n of the par ole board replied, \"That' s a matter of judgement .\" He also said that the parole board did not share an y of the blame for the police officer's dea th-\"No more than his mother should be blamed for beari ng him [Bun­ tio n] as a so n.\" Bunt ion' s girlfriend desc ribed him this way: \"He is intelli gent, he has a wonder ful sense of humor, he is very ea sygoing, very laid back; he is a gentlema n.\" Neither the victim of his sexual assault nor the family of the mu rdered officer is likely to agree with this rather biza rre depict ion of a grossly ant isocial man. As television reporter David Lee Miller put it, \"Love may be blind, but what 's the excuse for the Texa s Parole Board for failing to see the truth about Carl Wayne Bunt ion?\" Is Bunt ion a psyc hopath? Probably. Had the institu tional au­ thorities insist ed that a proper asse ssment be made as part of his ap plication for parole, and had the parole board been as tute enough to integrate the diagnosis and his criminal record, it is unlikely that Bunt ion would have been relea sed from pr ison. After all, it would not have taken a gen ius to predict that a Car l Bunt ion was not suddenly going to become a model citi zen .

Moreover, board members often have too little time to do a thorough job. And in many cases they are reluctant to use, or are confused by, the clinical reports provided by psychiatri sts and psycholog ists . Having seen my shar e of such reports, I understand why many par ole boards do not find them very helpf ul in ma king difficult decisions about early release from pr ison. Many clinical reports are vague or full of jar gon, and some provide diagnoses that lack empir ical evi­ dence of their ability to predict rec idivism and violence . The Power of La beling Accurate diagnoses that also have predictive validity can be extremely usef ul to the criminal justice sys tem . The success of the Psychopathy Checklist in predicting recidivism and violence attests to this. However, it is also important to understand the dangers of inaccurate diagnosis and faulty lab eling. In the cor­ rectional system, for ex ample, a single entry in a file by an int ake officer or a prison psychologist can mar k an inmate like Cain . Suppose, for example, that a young man in prison for a series of burg laries has become eligible for par ole. The overworked and underpaid prison psychologist gives the man a brief int er­ view and makes a cursory examin ation of his fi le, not ing that a few years earlier a psychia tri st had said that he was an \"a ntiso­ cial personalit y.\" In writing his report, the psychologist states that, in his clinical opinion, the inmate is a psychopath and ther e­ fore a poor parole risk. Parole is denied by a boa rd swayed by what it thi nks the label means and concerned about the rising crime rate . The inmate subsequently becom es depressed and commits suicide . At the inquest, the hapless ps ychologist tes ti­ fies tha t he made his diagnosis on the ba sis of file infor ma tion and a fifteen-minute inter view . On the other side of the issue, however, accurate assess ments ca n be ver y useful in the cla ssification of off enders, determining work as signme nts, making decisions about appr opriate treat­ ments and interventions, planning for release, and prepar ing staff to deal with offenders on a daily bas is.

In a recent example, a patient killed a mem ber of the staff of the largest hospital for mentally disordered offenders in North America . 1 The administ ration and staf f met and agreed on the inst itution of a new policy: A patient with both a high score on the Psychopathy Checklis t and a history of violence must under go a special adminis trative review before being considered for assi gnment to a lower level of security within the hospit al.

Proper diagnos tic procedure, as def ined by the standards of practice of psychological and psychia tric as socia tions, requires a careful examina tion and testing of the individ ual and adher­ ence to widely accept ed, reliable diagnostic criteria . A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST in a southern state recently told me that he was able to argue successfu lly in cour t that his client, whom he had diagn osed as a psychopa th, was not re­ sponsible for a murder because \"your research shows that psy­ chopaths suffer from organ ic brain dama ge.'' It soon became clear that he was referring to a recently publi shed neuropsycho­ logical study in which we actually concl uded that psychopaths did not suffer from organic brain dama ge, as measured by stan­ dard tests. His submis sion to the cour t on behalf of his client was based on an erroneous reading of our study . The psyc hiatrist's mistake was a lifesaver for his client: He avoided the death penalt y. In my view, not only ar e Gr igson 's diagnostic proc edures and the facile conc lusions he draws objectionable on scient ific and clinical grounds, but they reflect an odd belief in his own infalli­ bility as a judge of characte r. Even under the most ideal condi­ tio ns, with access to high-qualit y inform ation and using strict diagnos tic criteria, psychiatric diagnosis and predictability are not error-fr ee .

However, having a tool and us ing it properly are two separ ate things . The following scenario dramat­ ically illust rates the dangers of failing to use proper procedure in apply ing this diagno stic tool.

Nor have the biological thera­ pies, including psychosurgery, electroshock therapy, and the us e of various drugs, fared much better. 1 At this writing, in early 1993, the situation with regard to trea tment remains essentially the same as it has always been . 1.93"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE Indeed, many writers on the sub ject have commented that the shortest chapt er in any book on psychopathy should be the one on treatment .

However, with our social inst itutions threatened by soaring crime rates and our legal, mental health, and criminal justice systems overburdened to the point of paralysis, it is ess ential that we cont inue the quest for methods to reduce the enormous impact that ps ychop aths have on society . CLIN ICIANS OFTEN DESCRIBE psychopaths as individuals whose powerful psychologic al defense mechan isms effect ively squelch anxiety and fear. Laboratory research supports this view and sugges ts that there may be a biologic al basis to their ability to cope with stress. This may sound as if psychopaths are to be envied . However , the downside is that the boundary be­ tween fearless and foolhardy is fuzzy: Psychopaths are always getting into trouble, in large part because their behavior is not motivated by anxiety or guided by cues that warn of danger. Like individuals who wear dark sungl asses indoors, they look \"cool \" but they miss much of what goes on around them. Some particula rly gruesome examples of the ability to remai n cool in what should be an extremely fearful situation have re­ cently come to light.

Dahmer mur­ dered the boy soon after they left. During his trial, in which he pleaded guilty but insane to fifteen murders (the jury found him sane) , evidence of other close calls came to light. For example, an Associ ated Press report (February 11, 1992) described an incident in which Dahmer was stopped by police while he was driving the body of his first victim to the dump.

Why Nothing Seems to Work A basic as sumpt ion of psychotherapy is that the patient needs and wants help for dist ressing or pa inful ps ychological and emo­ tional prob lems: an xiety, depression, poor self-e steem, shy ne ss, ob sessive thoughts, compulsi ve behaviors, to name but a few . Successful therapy also requires that the pat ient actively partici­ pate with the therapist in the search for relief of his or her sympt oms. In sh ort, the patient must recognize that ther e is a problem and must want to do something ab out it. And here is the crux of the issue: Psychopaths don't fe el they have psychological or emotio n11l probl ems, and they see no reason to change their behavior to conf orm to societal standards with which they do not agree . To elaborate, ps ychopaths are generally well satisf ied with themselves and with their inner landscape, bleak as it may seem to outside obser vers . They see nothing wrong with themselves, experience little pe rsonal distre ss, and find their behavior ratio­ nal, rewar ding, and satisfying; they never look back with regret or forward with concern. They perceive themselves as super ior beings in a hostile, dog-eat-dog world in whi ch others are com­ petitors for power and resource s. Psyc hopaths feel it is legiti­ mate to manipulate and deceive others in order to obtain their \"righ ts, \" and their social interactions are planned to outmaneuver the male volence they see in othe rs. Given these attitu des, it is not sur prising that the purpose of most psychot herapeut ic approaches is lost on psycho pat hs. There are other reasons why psyc hopaths are such poor candi­ dates for ther apy. Consider the fol lowing: • Psy chopaths are not \"fragile\" indiv iduals. What they think and do are extensions of a rock-solid personality structure that is extremely resistant to outside influence .

Others are skilled enough to weave their way through life without too much personal inconvenience . And even those who are caught and punished for their transgr essions typically blame the sys­ tem, others, fate- anything but themselves -for their predica­ ment.

They may learn new and better ways of manipulat ing other people, but they make little effort to cha nge their own views and attitudes or to under­ stand that other people have needs, feelings, and righ ts. In par­ ticular, attempts to teach psyc hopaths how to \"really feel\" remorse or empat hy are doomed to fail ure . These sobering conc lus ions apply both to individ ual therapies, in which a therapist and a patient interact one-on-one, and to group therapy, in which people with different pr oblems try to learn from one another and to develop new ways of thinking and feeling about themselves and others . • As I noted ea rlier, ps yc hopaths frequently dominate individ­ ual and group therapy sessions, imposing their own views and interpretations on the other membe rs. For example, a gro up leader in a pr ison therapy program had this to say about an inmate who had scored very high on the Psychopath y Checkl ist: \"He ref uses to talk about things he doesn't init iat e. He doesn't like to be confronted or quest ioned abou t his behavior .... He ref uses to see how he blocks communication and dominates the therapy group by his long-winded monolog ues that attempt to circumvent discussions ab out his own behavior .\" Yet, shortly after this was written, the ps ychiatrist wrote, \"I am certain he has impr oved. He accepts responsibility for his actio ns .\" And a psychol ogist wrote, \"He has made good progre ss. . . .

[From an article by Moir a Farrow in The Vancouver Sun, March 2, 1991.] Therapy May Make Them Worse Some form of gro up therapy is an important part of most pr ison and court-mandated treatment progr ams . Group therapy is somet imes embedded in a \"therapeut ic community\" progra m, in which the inmates or pat ients are given consid erable responsi­ bility for ru nning their own lives. The ward staff forms an inte­ gral par t of the communit y, and is specially tra ined to focus on the needs and capabilities of the pat ients and to tre at them in a humanitar ian and respectful way. Such prog rams are intensive and very expensive, in terms of both facilities and personnel, and they wor k reas onably well with most off enders . But they do not work fo r psychopa ths. Evidence for this stark conclusion is provided by several re­ cent studies of forensic patients treated in a ther apeut ic com mu­ nity progr am. In each case, the pa tients were ass essed with the Psychopathy Check list. t98"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Can Anything Be Done? • In one study, psyc hopaths were not motivated to do well, dropped out of trea tment early, and derived relatively little benef it from the progr am. Following release from prison, their rate of retur n was much higher than that of the other patien ts. 3 • In an other study, psychopaths were almost four times mor e likely to commit a violent offense following rele ase from a thera­ peutic community program than were other patients . 4 But not only was the program not effective for ps yc hopaths, it may actu­ ally have made them worse! Psyc hopaths who did not take part in the program were less violent following release from the unit than were the trea ted psychopa ths. At fi rst glance this fi nding may seem bizarre . How could psychotherapy make a person worse? But the fi nding is not at all sur prising to those who run these pr ogr ams. They repor t that the psyc hopat hs usually dominat e the proceedings, fre­ quently playing \"head ga mes\" with the gr oup leaders and other patients . \"Your problem is that you ra pe women be­ ca use you unconsciously want to punish them for what your mother did to you ,\" the ps ychopat h pedant ically tells another patient . At the same time, he offers few insi ghts into his own behavi or. Unfortu nat ely, progra ms of this sort merely provide the psy­ chopath with better ways of manipula ting, deceiving, and using peop le. As one ps ychopath put it, \"These programs are like a finishing school . They teach you how to put the squeeze on people .\" They are also a rich source of facile excu ses for the psycho­ pat h's behavior: \"I was an abused chil d,\" or, \"I never learned to get in touch with my feelings .\" After-the-fact insights of this sort explain very little, but they sound good to those primed to hear them . I am constantly amazed at how willing some profes­ sio nals are to take such sta tements at face val ue. Gr oup therapy and therapeutic communit y progra ms are not the only sour ce of new tactics psyc hopaths use to convince oth­ ers that they have changed.

These progr ams, like those devoted to therapy, may supply psycho­ paths with little more than sup erficial insight and knowledge of terms and concepts -buzzwords-having to do with inter­ personal and emot ional pro cesses, but they allow psyc hopaths to convince the gulli ble that they have been rehabilitated or \"born again .\" Young Psychopaths Logica lly, our best chance of reducing the impact of adult psychopathy on society is to attack the problem ea rly . Thus far, however, such efforts have not been very successf ul. Following an extensive review of treatment progra ms, sociologist William McCord was led to conclude that \"at tempts to deflect the person from his or her ps ychopathic pattern early in life\" genera lly have not been succ essf ul . 5 Still, he felt that some hope was offered by prog rams in which the individ ual's social and physical envi­ ronment was completely changed and the entire resour ces of the ins titution were mobilized to promote fundamental changes in his or her attitudes and behav iors . But the results of one such progra m, de scribed in detail by McCord, are sober ing. Altho ugh the attitudes and behaviors of psychopathic adolescents seemed to impr ove during and after the program, the effect dissipat ed as they got older. The situat ion may chang e as we learn more about the roots of psyc hopathy. Further, psychologists have developed inter­ vent ion progra ms that are quite successful in cha nging the atti­ tudes and behaviors of children and adolescents who have a variet y of behavioral prob lems. Many of these progra ms deal not only with the child but also with the family and social context in which the prob lems occu r. 6 If used at a very ear ly age, it is pos sible that some of these progra ms will be useful in modifying the behavioral patterns of \"budding ps yc hopat hs,\" perha ps by reducing aggression and impul sivity and by teaching them strategies for satisfying their needs in more prosocial ways . 200"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Can Anything Be Done? Another Sober ing Thought Virt ually all the evidence on the effective ness of treatment for psycho paths is based on progra ms for people in prison or psychiatric fac ilities or in trouble with the law. Many of these programs are intensive, well thought out, and carried out under reasonably good conditi ons. And still they are ineffectiv e. Even if some program were effective in changing the attitudes and behaviors of ps ycho paths, there would be no way of using it to deal with the millions of ps yc hopaths not in cust ody or court mandat ed to enter treat ment . There is little or no chance that any on-the-street ps yc hopaths would even cont emplat e en­ tering such a progr am. And society has no means of forcing them to do so . Occa sional case reports or bits of an ecdotal evidence claim that some particular procedure has had a beneficial effect on a psyc hopath . For ex ample, in the past few years several people have told me that they have manag ed to bring about consider­ able improvement in the behavior of a ps ychopath they lived with . They can't understand why I don' t get excited ab out their exper ienc es. Per haps they did manage to make a therapeutic breakthr ough, but there is no way of determining if this is the ca se. Was the treated individual actually a psyc hopath? Did he or she impr ove in middle age, a time when the behaviors of some ps ycho paths \"spo ntaneously\" improve? What was the individ ual's behavior like before this change? And how do we know that it was the \"psyc hopat h\" who changed? Many people confuse improve­ ment in the behavior of the psyc hopath with changes in the way they themselves deal with the pers on. For example, a woman with a psychopathic hus band may say that he is not quite as bad as he once was. But what really may have ha ppened is that she learned how to deal with the problem by keeping out of his way or by working extra hard to sat isfy his needs and deman ds. She may have buried her personality and sacrif iced her needs and aspi rations in order to reduce con­ flict and tension in the relatio nship . We cannot take seriously claims of effective trea tments for 20i"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSC IE NCE psychopathy unless they are based on carefully controlled em­ pirical studi es. Should We Simpl y Give Up? Depressing though the evidence is, there are several things that we should consider before writing ps ychopaths off as un­ treatable or unma nageable . o First, despite the hun dreds of attempts to treat these indi­ viduals and the great variety of techniques tried, there have been few progra ms that meet ac ceptable scientific and method­ ological standar ds. This is an important point, beca use it means that the evidence we base our conclusions on is not very sound . This applies both to the common reports that a pa rticular pro­ gra m didn't work and to the occa sional report that something did work . Most of what we know is based primar ily on clinical folk lore, single-ca se studies, poor diagnostic and methodological procedur es, and inadequate program eva luat ion . Indeed, the state of the treatment literature on psychopathy is appa lling. Per haps the most fru strating thing about reading the treat­ ment literatur e is that the diagnost ic procedures often are hope­ lessly inadequat e or so vaguely described that it is imposs ible to determine whether a given program had an ything at all to do wit h psyc hopat hy. Another recurrent problem in trying to eva luat e treatment or manag ement progra ms is the failure to use carefully selected control or comparison groups. We know that the behavior of many psychopaths improves with age, and it is important to know the extent to which a given thera peut ic pr ogram impr oves on the \"natur al\" or \"s pontaneous\" changes that occur with age . o Second, few treatment programs are de signed specifically for psyc hopaths, and those that are have to contend with so many admini strative, gove rnment, and pu blic policy issues that they soon become something other than what was orig inally intend ed. The fact is, a well conceived and methodolog ically 202"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Can Anything Be Done? sound program for the treatment of ps yc hopaths has yet to be designed, carried out, and ev aluat ed. • The third point is that some of our efforts to treat ps ycho­ paths may be misplac ed . The term treatmen t implies that there is something to trea t: illness, subj ective distre ss, maladapt ive behaviors, and so forth . But, as far as we can determine, psy­ chopaths are perfectly happy with themselves, and they see no need for treatment, at least in the traditional sense of the term . It is a lot easier to change people' s att itudes and behaviors when they are unhappy with them than when they consider them perfectly normal and logic al. But isn't the behavior of psychopaths maladapt ive? The an­ swer is that it may be maladapt ive for society but it is adapt ive for the indiv iduals themselv es. When we ask ps ychop aths to modify their behavior so that it conforms to our expectations and norms, we may be ask ing them to do somet hing that is ag ainst their \"nature .\" They may agree to our reque st, but only if it is in their own best interests to do so. Prog rams designed to get ps yc hopaths to cha nge their behavior will have to take this into account or be doomed to failure . \" EVERYBODY SWEARS PSYCHOPATHS can't be treated . That's a lot of hogwash ,\" said Joseph Fredricks, a homosexual pe do­ phile whose long history of viole nce included the murder of an eleven-year-old boy. \"Psychopaths are as huma n as anyo ne. They're psychopaths because they are more sensit ive than anyone .... They can't stand pain of any sort, that's why they let it roll off their backs ,\" he said. [Canad ian Press, Septe mber 22, 1992] Elements of a New Program Recognizing the urgent need for new ways to deal with crimi­ nal ps ychopaths, and aware of the prevailing pessimism about traditional treatment programs, the Canadian government re­ cently chall enged me to desi gn an exper imental treatment/m an­ ag ement pr ogram for these off enders. I accepted the challenge 203"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CI ENCE for two reasons . First, as I indicated above, previous programs typically have been flawed in a number of ways, and none has been firmly gro unded in the latest ad vances in theory, research, and clinical and correct ional experie nce . Second, there obviously is an ur gent need for progra ms that can reduce the likelihood that psychopathic and other offenders will commit violent acts both in pr ison and following their release into the community. I put together an international panel of exper ts in psychopa­ thy, ps ychia try, criminology, correctional treatment, and pro­ gram des ign and evaluat ion. 7 At several meet ings we decided that the focus of our efforts should be on psychopathic and other off enders prone to violence, and we hammered out the br oad outline of a model program that we felt had a reason able chance of succ ess. The government recently has decided to go ahead with the progra m, and steps are being taken to set up an exper imental unit at a federal inst itut ion. Althoug h it is not pos sible to provide a detailed de scription of the program in this book, some broad princ iples can be out­ lined . To a large extent, these principles are based on the view that the premise of most correctio nal programs-that most of­ fenders have somehow gone off track and need only to be reso­ cialized -is faulty when appl ied to psychopa ths. From societ y's persp ective, psychopaths have never been on track; they da nce to their own tune . This means that the pr ogram for psycho paths will be less con­ cerned with attempts to develop empathy or conscience than with intensive efforts to convince them that their current att i­ tudes and behavior are not in their own self -interest, and that they alone must bear respon sibility for their behavior. At the same time, we will attempt to show them how to use their strengths and abilit ies to satisfy their needs in ways that society can tolera te. Of neces sit y, the program will involve very tight control and supervision, as well as clear and certain consequ ences for trans­ gre ssions of progra m, ins titutio nal, and societal ru les. It will also take adva ntage of, and seek ways to speed up, the tendency of some ps yc hopaths to improve \"spontaneou sly\" as they reach middle age . The inst itutional components of the pr ogram will be followed 204"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Can Anything Be Done? by strict control and intensive super vision following rel ease into the community . The design of the program will allow for the empirical evalua­ tion of a variety of trea tment components, or modules (what works and what doesn't work for particular indiv iduals) . Some components may be effective with ps ycho paths but not wit h other offenders, and vice versa . The pa rtici pants in the program will be compared with carefully selected control (untreated) groups of off enders . A program of this sort will be expensive and always in danger of erosion beca use of cha nging institutional needs, political pres­ sures, and communit y concer ns. And it is likely that the results will be modest at be st. However, the alt ernatives -to bear the enormous expense of keeping offenders at high risk fo r violence in prison, or to run the risk of letting them out-are not ver y attractive . If Nothing Works, What Then? If you are dealing with a true ps ychopath it is important to recognize that the current prognosis for significa nt improvement in his or her attitudes and behavior is poor. Even if the exper i­ mental program described above bears fruit, it will not be of much use to psychopaths who are not in pr ison or subj ect to tight control . If you are living with or married to a psyc hopath, you may already suspe ct that things are not going to get any better, and you may feel trapped by circu mstances, unable to escape with­ out pu tting yourself or others-especia lly your children -at risk. The pr oblem is particularly difficult-and da nger ous -for a woman living with a psychopathic man who has a strong need to possess and control peop le.

But there are a few things worth trying. For example, don't pay too much atten tion to any unusually capt ivating characteristic of people you meet -dazzling looks, a power ful presence, mesmer izing mannerisms, a soothing voice, a rapidf ire verbal pitch, and so forth . Any one of these character­ istics can have enormous sleight-of-hand va lue, serving to dis­ tract you from the indivi dual's real messag e .

Normal people maintain close eye contact with others for a var iet y of rea sons, but the fixated stare of the psychopath is more a prelude to self­ gratif ication and the exercise of power than simple inter est or empat hic car ing. 1 Some people respond to the emotionless stare of the psycho­ pat h wit h consider able discomfort, almost as if they feel like potential prey in the presence of a predator. Others may be complet ely overwhelmed and int imidated, perha ps even con­ trol led, with little insight into what is hap pening to th em. What­ ever the ps ychological meaning of their ga ze, it is clear that intense eye contact is an important factor in the abilit y of some psychopaths to manipulat e and domina te others .

Although the eyes are in fact highl y fa llible indic a­ tors of the inner world of others, they are not entirely devoid of informa tion, particularly when the message they convey to oth­ ers appears inconsis tent with the individual 's facial expressions and verbal beha vior.

Clinical anecdotes about the \"emp ty\" eyes of psychopaths abou nd, but it is true crime books that offer the most vivid descriptions of how unsettling their gaze can some times be. For exam ple, in his book Last Rampage James Clarke had this to say about Gary Tison, a convicted murderer who master fully manipulated the prison system, escaped from prison with the help of his sons, and went on a killing spree : But Gary's most striking physical featur�the thing most people noticed and never forgot -was his deep­ set, expressionless ... eyes. It was as if his eyes had no conne ction with any emotion he expressed . What­ ever his mood-whether he was angr y, jovial, or any­ thing in between-his eyes remained the same. Emp ty. It was impossible to tell what Gary was actually thinking or feeling by looking at his eyes .... His stare was rivet­ ing, unset tling, with a malign intensity . What peo ple re­ mem bered most about Gary were those cold, hard eyes .

The book contains numer ­ ous references to the eyes of the two men. For exam ple, Wam­ baugh had this to say about Bradf ield: He had brooding blue eyes. . . . His gaze was so in­ tense it could transfi x, so his blue eyes were variously descri bed as \"poet ic,\" \"icy,\" or \"hypnotic ,\" depend ing upon his moods.

When Bradfi eld tried the stare on a police officer, Jack Holtz, the latter stared back and said, \"That bullshit only works on int elligent peop le.\" Equally interesting was Wamba ugh's desc ription of Jay Smith, recently freed by the Supreme Cour t of the Common­ wealth of Pennsylvania on procedural grounds. Smith's secre­ tary reportedly said: You've never seen such a pair of eyes in all your life. There was no feeling in them . You might think you've known a few people with cold fish eyes, but not like his. Wam baugh comme nted that \"They were not fish eyes. They were eyes that newspaper editors in later years loved to isolate for effect. They were referred to as 'reptilian,' but that was not correct either.\" Later he said that all the teachers \"had trouble descri bing the eyes of their princip al. 'Amphibian ' came to mind, but that wasn't prec isely correct eithe r.'' Smith's secretary finally realized what his eyes resembled, said Wambaug h. \"N ot fish, not reptiles ...

Ask the individual about his or her friends, family, relatives, employment, place of resi­ dence, plans, and so forth . Psyc hopaths usu ally give vague, eva sive, or inconsistent replies to queries about their personal liv es. Be susp icious of such replies, and try to verify them . This is sometimes surprisingly easy to do . For example, sev­ eral years ago a woman I know became romant ically involved with a man she'd met at her chu rch . He appe ared to be well connected and to have imp eccable cred ent ials, and he said he was a gra duat e in bu siness admini stration from a well-known eastern uni versit y.

I receive many calls from concerned people who think a husband, wife, child, or friend is a ps ycho­ path and who want my advi ce on what to do about it. I cannot offer advi ce under such conditi ons. A proper diagno sis of ps y­ chopa thy, by a knowledg eable clinicia n, is time-c onsuming and requires a good deal of reliable information, including an inten­ sive interview with the individ ual in ques tion and acce ss to col­ lat eral and corroborative information from a variety of sourc es: empl oyers, family members, friends, business ass oc iates, the po­ lice, and so on. Make sure the clinician you consult is familiar with the literature on psychopathy and has had experience in dealing with psycho­ paths, preferably in the context of family therapy and intervention. If you have the resources, get several opinions. This can be a very frustrating procedure. I can't count the number of times a tele­ phone caller, usually a wife or parent at wits' end, has described repeated attempts to get someone-anyone-to understand the problem, or even to recognize that there is a problem. Typical is a telephone call I received from a woman in Maine who had read a newspaper article about my work and wa s con­ vinced that her hus band perfectly mat ched the profile of psy- 214"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"A Sur vival Gui de chopathy outlined in the artic le. From what she told me abou t him it ap peared that she might very well have been righ t. For more than ten years she had been trying to get prof essional help, sta rting with her family doctor and moving through a suc­ cession of psychologists and psychia tri sts, all to no avail . The problem was that her hu sband always put on such a good show that her account of things was seldom believ ed. None of these clinic ians could see beyond the husb and's charming and con­ vincing display. The poor woman began to believe that she was the real proble m. Even after a solid diagnosis has been made, your troubles are far from over. The next steps will depend on your particular situation and should be planned with the aid of a competent prof essional experienced in dealing with psychopa th s. State psy­ chiatric and psychological ass ociations usually have a list of clini­ cia ns they can reco mmend . You might also try loca l mental health and universit y counseling cente rs. • Don 't blame you rself. Wha tever the reasons for your involve­ ment with a psyc hopath, it is important that you not accept blame for his or her attitudes and behavi or. Psyc hopaths play by the same rules-their rules-with everyon e. Of course, your own personal ity and behavior will have something to do with the sp ecific nature of the interactions that occu r. For ex ample, a woman who stands up for her rights may be physically abused, whereas a more submissive woman may spend her life wonder­ ing about the wher eabouts of her philandering hus ban d. A third woman might walk out at the first sign of trouble and never look back . In each case, the basic problem is having a ps ycho­ pathic hus band in the first place . Similar ly, par ents of a psych opathic son or daughter continu­ ally agonize over their own role in the development of the dis or­ der. It is very difficult to convince these parents that the chances are they did nothing wrong. Ag ain, they may have am eliorated or exacer bated the situation, but there is no evidence that paren­ tal behavior causes psyc hopa thy. • Be aware of who the victim is . Psyc hopaths often give the im­ pression th at it is they who are suffering and that it is the victims 21.5"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"WIT HOUT CONS CIE NCE who are to blame for their mi sery . But they are suffering a lot less than you are, and for different rea sons . Don't waste your sympathy on them; their problems are not in the same league as yours . Theirs stem primarily from not getting what they want, whereas yours result from a physical, emotional, or financial pounding . • Reco gni ze tha t you are not alone. Most psycho paths have lots of victim s. It is certa in that a psych opath who is causing you grief is also causing grief to others . Tracking them down to excha nge stor ies and infor mat ion could help you deal with the prob lem, if only to demonstr ate that it is not you who are at fa ult. Everyone is vulnerable to the psyc hopath, and there is no shame in being victimiz ed. This may be difficult to accept if you have just been conned and are too embarra ssed to com plain to the police or to testify in court . But you may be sur pr ised by the number of other people in your community who have been taken in. • Be care fu l about power struggles. Keep in mind that ps ycho­ paths have a strong need for psychological and physical control over others . They must be in cha rge, and they will use charm, int imidat ion, and viole nce to ensu re their aut hority . In a power strug gle a psychopath will usually focus on winning. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't stand up for your rights, only that it will probably be difficult to do so without risking ser ious emotional or physical trauma . In some cases, you may be able to use the ps ycho path' s \"win at all costs\" philosophy to your advant age . For example, in a loca l case a woman and her psychopathic ex-hus band were en­ ga ged in a prolo nged and bitter custody dispute over their two childr en. The lawyer for the woman, realizing that the man was danger ous, was intent on winning, and didn't ac tually care about the welf are of the children, advised his client to agree to a joint custody arrangement. This is what the ex-h us band had wanted all alon g, and having \"won the battle ,\" he lost all inter­ est in the childr en. Although the lawyer' s tact ics worked in this ca se, he ran a great risk of having the man decide to exercise 21.6"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"A Su rvival Gui de his right of joint custody, with potentially disastrous conse­ quences for the childr en. • Set .firm ground rules . Although power struggles with a psy­ chopath are risky at best, you may be able to set up some clear ground rules-both for yourself and for the psychopa th-to make your life easier and begin the diff icult tra nsit ion from vic­ tim to a person looking out for yourself. For example, this may mean that you will no longer bail him or her out of troubl e, no matter what the circ umstanc es. A woman I know was caught in a web of fi nancial manipula­ tion and deceit woven by a glib \"consult an t.\" Every time she confronted him, he convinced her that he was working on the problem and that she would soon get back the money he sup­ posedly had invested for her. Finally, in desper ation, she de­ cided not to discuss anything with him unless there was a third party present or everything was in writin g. It soon became clear to her that she was getting nowhere with him, and she bega n legal proceedings to recover her money . Reasonable but firm ground rule s-- \"what you have to do to live here\" -may be the only way to prese rve your sanit y when dealing with a psychopa thic son or daught er. These ru les must be clear and consi stently enforced if they are to stand any chance of having an impact. Specific parenting skills and strategies are outside the scope of this book, but the books list ed in the Notes for chapter 12 provide helpf ul informa tion. • Don 't expect dramatic changes. To a large extent, the personali­ ties of ps ychopaths are \"carved in stone .\" There is little likeli­ hood that anyt hing you do will produce fundamental, sust ained changes in how they see themselves or others. They may prom­ ise to cha nge and may even show short-ter m improvements in their beha vior, but in most ca ses you will face years of disap­ pointm ent if you believe that per manent changes for the better have occur red. Although some psychopaths do \"mellow\" a bit with age, and as a consequence bec ome somewha t easier to live with , in most cases they remain what they have always been . The problem is particularly tragic when it is a son or daughter who is psychopathic. In a frantic search for help and understand- 217"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONS CIE NCE ing, the parents typically find themselves shunted from one pro­ fessional or agency to another, seldom with satisfactory results. The bewildered parents use an enormous amount of energy and resources in generally unsuccessful attempts to understand and control their chi ld. In most cases, they face years of frustration and demands to bail their son or daughter out of trouble. • Cut you r losses . The ps ych opath may succeed in sha ttering your self -conf idence and may convince you-and your friends-­ that you are unwor thy of his or her time or even that you are \"losing it. \" The more you give in, the more you will be taken advant age of by the psychopath's insa tiable app etite for power and contr ol. Rather than make fru itless attempts to adapt to a hopeless situa tion-u sually by giving in, accepting your lot in life, or losing your self-identit y-it may be better to recognize that your emotional and physical sur vival requires that you take charge of your life . This can be a tricky move-even a da ngero us one­ and it requires good prof essional advice, both clinical and leg al. Of course, if you are the parent of a young psychopath, you cannot simply give up on your chi ld. You will have to work closely with teachers, counselors, and clinicians experienced in dealing with ps ychopathic children, no ma tter how modest the expected results . • Use sup port groups. By the time your suspicions have led you to seek a diagno sis, you already know that you 're in for a very long and bumpy ride. Mak e sur e you have all the emotional support you can must er . Many organizations and groups are devoted to helping victims of cr ime to understand and cope with their plig ht. In most cases the victim learns that he or she is not alone and is able to share experiences with other victim s. For example, most urban areas have crisis centers and supp ort groups concerned with domest ic violence, emot ionally and behaviorally distur bed children, and vict ims' rig hts . Depe nding on the nature of the problem, one or more of these established groups may be of real benefit to yo u. But what we really need are support grou ps specifically de­ signed for the victims of psyc hopat hs. Perhaps this book will help to encour age the development of such gro ups. 2i8"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Epilogue After they have reviewed the literature on a topic it is cus­ tomary for scientists to conclude with the stat ement that more research is needed . I will do so, for two rea sons . First, in spite of more than a century of clinical study and speculation and several decades of scientific research, the mys­ tery of the psychopat h still remain s. Some recen t developments have provided us with new insights int o the nature of this dis­ turbing disorder, and its borders are becoming more defined . But the fact is, compared with other maj or clinical disorders, little systema tic resear ch has been devoted to psychopa thy, even though it is responsible for far more social dist ress and disrup­ tion than all other psychiatric disorders combin ed. Second, rather than try to pick up the pieces after the damage has been done, it would make far greater sense to increase our efforts to under stand this perplexing disorder and to sea rch for effective early interventi ons . The alt ernatives are to continue de­ voting mass ive resources to the prosecu tion, incarceration, and supervision of psychopaths after they have committed off enses ag ainst societ y, and to continue to ignore the welfare and plight of their victi ms. The criminal just ice system spends billions of dol lars ever y year in a va in attempt to \"rehabilitate\" or \"resocial­ ize\" psych opaths and other persistent off enders . But these 2t9"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"WITHOUT CONSCIENCE terms --popular with politic ians and prison administ rators--are little more than buzzw ord s. We have to learn how to socialize them, not resocialize them . And this will require serious efforts at resear ch and ear ly intervent ion . The social and fi nancial costs to society of failing to solve the deadly myster y of the psychopath will be stagger ing. It is imper ative that we continue the sea rch for clu es. 220"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Chapter Notes Intro duct ion 1. Tim Cahill (1987). Bu ried Dre ams. New York: Bantam Books . 2.

In their influential 1964 book, The Psychopa th: An Essay on the Crim inal Mind. (Princeton, NJ: Van Nostr and), William and Joan McCord argued that social factors were a major cause of psy­ chop athy . Recently, Joan McCord had this to say about the problem: \"Both parental rejection and inconsistent punit iveness have been implicated in the etiology of psychopa thy ....

Evidence from family, twin, and adopt ion studies indicates that criminality and violence in general, and psychopathy in particu­ lar, are at least influenced by genetic and biological contribu­ tions to temper ament, and shaped by environmental and social force s.
