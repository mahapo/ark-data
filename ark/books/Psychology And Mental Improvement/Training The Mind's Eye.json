The audiocassette tape sides on which each subject appears are presented in parenthesis following each subject heading. This reference section allows you to return to specific subjects for periodic review even when you do not have time to listen to the tapes once again or when you cannot remember on which tape side it originally appeared."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Affirmations (Side 6) Affirmations are the most powerful form of self-talk. They are manifestations of your will, which is the key to igniting your imagination—and, thus, visualization. Because they seem so simple, affir - mations have in the past been overlooked as an effective method for suc - cess. T o d a y , however, more and more successful business people, medical patients and athletes are using visualization techniques to get what they want out of life. Two key elements of an affirmation are: • the way you formulate the suggestion you wish to program into your brain • the number of times you repeat the affirmation Keep your affirmation short and simple enough that a six-year old child will understand it. Always state it in the positive, as if you already have what you are affirming. Always state it aloud, repeating it from five to 20 times. The following are sample affirmations for various areas in which you might set goals. High Self-Esteem “I am influenced only by positive thoughts and positive people.” “I am loved...I deserve love.” “New opportunities stimulate my strengths and confidence.” “All childhood and teen-age wounds are healed.” “I am continually discovering new strengths inside myself.” “I radiate confidence and joy.” Monetary and Financial Success “I am allowing greater financial success into my life.” “I am attracting more financial opportunities—easily and effortlessly.” “I am worthy and deserving of financial success.” “I am financially independent and secure.” “My unlimited thinking is opening new doors to abundance and prosperity.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Reducing Stress Levels “I am increasingly calm, confident and relaxed.” “I am developing inner peace and balance in my life.” “I have released concerns about things I cannot change.” “I am at peace in my body, my mind and my emotions.” “There is time and space for everything I need to do.” Goal Setting “I am very clear about what I want in life.” “I am living my life by choice and creating my future.” “My life is becoming a series of positive achievements.” “My self-discipline and inner focus are becoming stronger each day.” “I have moved beyond old limitations and am easily achieving my goals.” Beliefs (Side 4) Beliefs always, always precede reality. A belief is framework or mental skeleton on which we keep adding incoming perceptions and experiences, on which we store data to support those beliefs. Beliefs can sometimes be obstacles on our journey to happiness and suc- cess. They are called limiting core beliefs. We aren’t consciously aware of many of these, since they were acquired early in our lives and have been incorporated into our web of consciousness. See the exercises in the next section of this guidebook to help you identify your limiting core beliefs. Brain vs. Mind (Side 6) Y our brain is the marvelous three-pound, gelantinous physical organ, the conductor of energy, the hardware. Your mind is the non-physical “you,” the part of you that holds your dreams, your hopes, your aspirations, your self- esteem. It is your mental software. Change (Side 4) It is changing your old programming, your old ways of thinking, your limit - ing beliefs that will allow you to get greater control of your life and to access your previously unclaimed power."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 There are six raw materials that underlie all change, that create our r e a l i t y . • Beliefs • Feelings • Attitudes • Decisions • Thoughts • Choices There are three tools you can use to chisel or carve the raw materials of your world into a new reality. • Desire • Expectation • Imagination Creating Your Reality Through Thoughts and Imagery (Side 8) D r . Deepak Chopra, a physician trained in both Western and A y u r v e d i c medical techniques, wrote in his book, Quantum Healing : “If you want to know what you were thinking three or four years ago, look at your body today. If you want to know what your body will be like in three or four years, check your thoughts today.” For your thoughts create your reality. To create the kind of reality you want for yourself, learn to control the kind of thoughts you have. Self-esteem, self-healing, stress management and addictions can all be positively affected by your thoughts. Envisioning the Future (Side 9) The critical key to everything we create or allow into our lives is our dreams, our vision of the future. When we visualize our various goals and dreams, we bring the future into the present, as if it has already happened. At the same time, we are processing out old debris, the subconscious obsta - cles on the pathways to our goals. Goals (Side 5) Goal setting is the most important tool a person can have or develop. Having a focus or self-determined destiny is the one quality consistently found in people who are high achievers. There are six general categories of goals that seem basic for most people. • High self-esteem • Good health, energy, vitality • Happy, loving relationships • Career and financial security • Mental improvement • Enhanced spiritual life There is a process to goal setting, one that, if followed and used in conjunc- tion with visualization techniques, can help you create the future you dream of."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 • Determine a six-month goal, one that is reachable but slightly out of reach, one that will force you to stretch a bit in order to attain it. • Determine a one-year goal, a two-year goal and a five-year goal, each increasingly “difficult” and each requiring increasingly more stretching, reach or change. • Set a 10-year goal, one that you will never reach completely, but that serves as an ideal you are striving toward. Goal Achievement (Side 7) There is an easy-to-use, eight-step model that you can apply to any of the goals or dreams you wish to achieve. • Write out your dream or goal as simply as possible. • Be clear about your motivation: why do you want to achieve this goal? • Write out at least two affirmations that will support the attainment of your goal. • Draw a picture or create a collage that depicts your goal as if it has already been achieved. • Determine what feelings you will experience upon the attainment of your goal. • Write out what you feel may be the possible roadblocks or hurdles to attaining your goal. • Decide what qualities you have to develop or strengthen in order to attain your goal. • Settle on the action steps that you are going to take, beginning tomorrow, that will start you journeying on your path to success. Goal Board (Side 5) Treasure charts or maps are one of the oldest devices for helping people through their lives. You, too, can create a treasure chart—or a goal board—to help you successfully map the road to your dreams. On a large piece of cardboard, use photos from old magazines, sales pam - phlets, etc., to illustrate your ultimate goal, as well as the shorter - t e r m goals and steps required to reach that goal. As each goal is achieved, a photo of a new goal can be placed on the board. This collage will stimulate your subconscious each time you see it, remind - ing you of and recharging you toward the achievement of your goal."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 Image Streaming (Side 3) A stream-of-consciousness visualization technique in which, after relaxing, you ask your subconscious a question or present it with a problem and, dur - ing which, a stream of spontaneously-generated thoughts will be presented by the subconscious as the desired answer or solution. See the Image Streaming exercises beginning on page 14 for practice with this technique. Imaging (Side 2) Imaging is very much like visualization (see below). The critical difference between the two is that imaging involves all five senses. There are five types of imaging. • Visual —sight • Auditory —sounds • Kinesthetic— feel or touch • Olfactory— smell • Gustatory —taste Left Brain (Side 2) The part of the human brain that processes information that is logical, intellectual, analytical and linear (in terms of time). It’s the reading, writ - ing, arithmetic part of us that relies on intelligence to get us through life. Limiting Beliefs (Side 3) Underlying or subconscious obstacles to success. The challenge is to uncover these deep-rooted limiting beliefs or roadblocks that detour us from our goals and our dreams. Magical Garden (Side 3) The beautiful, peaceful spot from which many of your visualization exercises will originate. This is also known as your safe mental place. Magnetic Belief Screen (Side 3) A large imaginary screen used during the Image Streaming technique to filter out your limiting core beliefs. Mental Imagery (Side 2) In contrast to physical objects, mental images have great flexibility and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 mutability. There are five kinds of mental imagery. • Spontaneous: imagery that seems to pop out of nowhere, like an unexpected fragment of a childhood memory. • Induced: imagery that is consciously selected and used for specific purposes, such as visualizing a sold sign on a piece of property you’re trying to sell. • Concrete and/or Abstract: imagery often used for regaining health or overcoming a bad habit. In order to stop smoking, concrete imagery might picture pink, healthy lungs, while abstract imagery might show a red circle with a red bar slashing through it superimposed over a lit cigarette. • General vs. Specific: imagery that is also helpful in a healing context. General imagery might show you as optimally healthy, energetic, brimming with vitality, and specific imagery might show a broken bone mending quickly and supportive muscle tissue regaining bulk and strength. • End Goal vs. Process Imagery: imagery that combines a picture of the final goal (perhaps winning a golf tournament) with one of the processes by which that goal is achieved (mentally practicing the shots needed to perfect a golf game). Relaxation States (Side 2) Vital to doing imagery work is the ability to progressively relax muscles, slow your breathing and heart beats and lower blood pressure. In this way , the body returns to its natural, healing state. In deeper states of relaxation, one is less likely to experience negative emotions like anxiety, fear and depression. By combining relaxation with imagery, a different brain wave pattern is created. There are four basic brain wave patterns. • Beta: the alert state with an electrical activity of brain pulses at 13 to 35 cycles per second. • Alpha: common among meditators, brain pulses in this state range from eight to 12 cycles per second. • Theta: profound imaging, visions, dreams, accelerated learning and self-healing are linked to this brain wave pattern, with pulses ranging from four to eight cycles per second. • Delta: this is the sleep state, with pulses ranging from one half to four cycles per second. It should be noted that the most effective visualization is done in a low Alpha/borderline Theta state."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Right Brain (Side 2) The part of the human brain that is non-verbal, creative, musical and emo - tional. It’s the intuitive part that makes non-logical but generally accurate decisions, that sees patterns or the big picture, that is involved in most visualization activities. Spiral of Success (Side 7) The spiral of success is also known as the aliveness/survival spiral. When one is truly alive, taking chances, there is an increasingly expanding spiral of opportunities reaching upward; when one is playing it safe, merely sur - viving, the series of spirals is getting increasing smaller. The aliveness/sur - vival phenomenon can be a metaphor in many areas of your life. Many people don’t know how to create a spiral of success. They have been conditioned to base their actions on duty and obligation (mere survival tac - tics), and continue to create a future based on what others say should be or what someone else believes to be right. They have never visualized a future not defined by someone else. Visualization (Side 2) The conscious creating of desired outcomes in your life. Visualization is sensing or seeing with your inner mental eyes. This is different from imag - ing (see above), in that visualization always involves seeing. The most common misconception about visualization is that you must be able to visualize with great clarity and vividness in order to be effective. In fact, vividness of imagery is not nearly as important as control of it. Don’t be concerned if, from time to time, you “see” only a fragment of an image. Just this fragment can trigger a subconscious association with the big picture, which very subtly brings in and involves more of your senses. Discover your own personal sense of pacing while visualizing. You can either take your time mentalizing, or you can allow images to flow out at a quick, kaleidoscopic speed. Both are equally effective, depending on your personal psychology. Visualization Techniques (Side 2) W ith any new skill or process that you learn, the more techniques you have at your disposal, the easier it will be to adapt and make changes, depend - ing on the challenge. Descriptions follow of six visualization techniques. The availability of various techniques helps avoid the boredom of using one technique over and over again, increases the likelihood of finding the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 goal/technique combination that is right for you and ignites different areas of the brain and to bring more of your brain cells into play. Note: All visualizations should be for no more than 30 seconds at one time. If you wish to program a goal for a second time in succession, follow the same procedure for 30 seconds more before moving on to your next goal. • Collage: create a montage or collage featuring five or six mental snapshots of different aspects of your goals having been achieved. • Strobing or Flash: take an end-goal picture and mentally flash it off and on, slowly at first, then speeding up, repeating the pattern until the image “takes” and ignites. • Computer-Generated: like a computer screen with a small colored dot in its center, within 30 seconds thousands of colored dots will begin appearing to generate and create the pattern and mental picture or your end goal. • Multi-Focus: mentally project beams of light or energy from your forehead, your heart and your solar plexus, each projecting an image of your end-goal, creating a 3-D holographic image. • Whoosh or Explosion: after picturing an old, pre-goal condition in drab colors, whoosh it away and replace it with an image of your goal achieved, painted in an explosion of bright colors and glistening energy. • In/Out or Dissociative: picture yourself inside your body looking through your eyes at a completed goal, then dissociate outside of your body and watch yourself as an observer in the goal picture. The following are three tips for improving your visualization and imaging skills. • Do your mental programming in an enthused, excited state as if you have already achieved your goal. Projecting gusto into your programming mobilizes the limbic system, your emotional mid- brain. • Use of all your brain when visualizing. The ideal brain states for effective visualization are the synergy of your mind-brain, the focused intent of your left brain and the playfulness or lightness of your right brain. • Use symbolic images of your goal for powerful, effective, real-life imagery."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 E X E R C I S E S In this section of the guidebook, exercises appearing on the audiocassettes are presented in the order in which they appear on those tapes.

Picture this garden full of medicinal plants and healing herbs, as well as other kinds of shrubs and rich, lush, green vegetation and flowers. Off to one side of the magical garden, imagine an extra-thick patch of soft, silky grass, a power spot where the force field or gravitational pull of the earth is very strong. Nearby, sense a slow-moving, shallow stream. As you look upstream, in the near distance see a waterfall, average-sized, with a ledge protruding half- way up. There is a mist of rainbow colors spraying just above it in the soft breeze. Also nearby, picture a large door frame-like structure, approximately seven feet in height and five feet across, with a very fine gold mesh screen stretched between the two side frames, as well as from the ground to the top of the framework. Across the top of the door frame, imagine an arched sign reading in bold print: Magnetic Belief Screen . F i n a l l y , in a nearby secluded area of your garden, mentalize or imagine a sanctuary, a place of calm and safety, with some type of a structure, maybe a gazebo, perhaps a healing temple or a chapel—depending on your personal preference. Image Streaming Warm-Up Exercise (Side 3) The warm-up exercise for image streaming can be done in one of two ways: • Alone, but recording all of your responses onto a tape recorder • With a partner, who records your responses Before beginning this exercise, select a scene—either the magical garden or a memorably beautiful scene from your past—in which it will take place. Make yourself comfortable, preferably lying down. Make sure your clothing is loose, non-restrictive. Possible distractions such as telephones should be muted or disconnected. Progressively relax yourself. Begin with all the muscles in your scalp and face, then move down through each muscle grouping through your neck, chest, upper back, middle and lower back muscles. Continue down through the lower body, the buttocks, thighs and lower legs. This process should be complete in about two to three minutes. Aloud, describe a scene from memory or from your magical garden, the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 scene you have selected previously. Describe what you see with your mental eyes. Keep describing it. Keep talking out loud. Have as few pauses, silences and down-times as possible. Continue the process for four to five minutes. Go deeper into the scene and the experience. Embellish your descriptions, describing the special qualities that make it so special. Then bring into the scene a person you know, someone with extraordinary powers of perception and imaging—someone you know to be an expert visu - alizer. It might be a young child, for, up to the age of six or seven, children are often visualizing virtuosos. Describe this person—still aloud. Still with lots of details. Still with no down time. Then, to get inside the experience of being more perceptive, put the head of the person you are describing, of the expert visualizer, onto to your own head, like putting on a football helmet. For the next two to three minutes, describe your beautiful, magical scene through this person’s eyes, allowing yourself to embellish the sensory richness of your description through the perception of your invited observer. Return your observer ’ s head to his or her own body. Thank him or her if you wish, then orient yourself back to an alert state—without rushing the process. Review what has just happened to you. What worked best for you? What images, sense, colors, textures, etc., were easiest to picture or feel? Which ones provided you with difficulty? Image Streaming (Side 3) Before beginning this exercise, be sure you have practiced the warm-up exercise, described above, at least twice. Again, you can either do this exer - cise with a partner or alone, using a tape recorder. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Begin by inhaling deeply, holding the breath and simultaneously tensing all muscles in the upper part of your body. Hold this breath for 10 seconds. Then slowly exhale, gently releasing all the tension in your muscles. Repeat four or five times, and then allow your breathing to slow more natu - rally, slowly and smoothly, the way you might stroke a soft piece of velvet. Imagine yourself inhaling relaxation, exhaling tension, inhaling relaxation, exhaling tension, etc. Once relaxed, begin a rapid, uninterrupted description (aloud) of whatever appears on your blank perceptual field (i.e. the backs of your eyelids). Even"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 if initially you see only blobs or splotches of color, describe them in an exag - gerated, detailed fashion. As the blobs take more definite shapes—a face, a memory, a long-forgotten scene—describe, describe, describe. Always in the present tense, as if it is happening now, which it is. After a few minutes, the images will flow much easier, they will become richer and more vivid, they will take on a life of their own. You just keep describing them. An image-streaming session should last no longer than eight to ten min- utes. Orient yourself to an alert state at your own speed. Review the expe - rience, either with your partner or into the tape recorder. When the Mental Pictures Won’t Come (Side 3) There are five techniques to use if, while attempting to image stream, the images just won’t come. After-Image: Stare at a fairly strong light source (60–100 watt—nothing brighter, certainly not the sun) for approximately one minute. Then close your eyes and begin describing the after-image of the light source. This a f t e r -image will be in several colors, almost kaleidoscopic. As you keep describing out loud, eyes closed, image streaming will begin spontaneously. Old Dream Recall: Remember a recent dream or dream fragment and begin describing it in the present tense. Allow no down time in your description. Perception Expert: Y ou’ve already practiced this. Think of a person who is a good visualizer and place this invited observer’s head on your own. Begin image streaming through the expert’s perceptions and senses. Magical Garden: This is basically the image streaming warm-up exercise. Some of the images will start breaking through, and the garden images will blend and fuse into image streaming. Pretend: Y ou may start with an image or images from memory to combine with pretend images. With ongoing detailed descriptions, the pretend images will blend into image streaming. The Magnetic Belief Screen and Removing Your Limiting Beliefs (Side 4) In your magical garden where your magnetic belief screen is located, image yourself standing before it, the framework covered by a very, very fine gold mesh screen."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Slowly and gently step through the magnetic belief screen several times. The fine mesh screen will filter the negative, limiting beliefs from you, which will remain behind as a residue on the screen, much like the lint on the screen in a clothes dryer. Peel off the residue and place it in a small, golden bowl at the foot of the belief screen. Hold the bowl up in both arms to the sun, so the healing and transformative powers of the sun transmute the negative, dark energy of the limiting beliefs into a potent, empowering energy, one that looks like millions of fireflies or a sea of Fourth of July sparklers. When it has been turned into positive energy, pour it over your head and allow the energy to be absorbed into every pore, every cell of your being, creating new seeds or sparks of consciousness, which you can use to ignite your future. Uncovering Roadblocks—Three Techniques (Side 4) For each of the following techniques, first have a specific question in mind that you would like to answer concerning roadblocks that might be in your w a y . For example, “What is my obstacle to having more loving relation- ships?” or “Why am I unable to increase the profitability of my business?” Technique # 1 : Lie down and, eyes closed, focus on your breathing to deepen your comfort and relaxation. Begin image streaming to get into a state of inner absorption. After two or three minutes of image streaming, shift to a structured image, one of you walking down a long corridor with many doors along each of its sides. Keep thinking about your question. Keep wondering what your roadblock might be. When your right brain has the answer to your question, a small light will go on above one of the doors. W ithout thinking, quickly go through that door into your answer space and begin image streaming again, describing out loud the scene or images in that room. That will be the answer you seek. If the answer or image is not clear, ask your right brain to show the same best answer, but in a different way. Proceed down the corridor of doors once more until a light goes on above one of the other doors. Again, without thinking, go through the door and begin image streaming out loud to describe your answer. Technique # 2 : Close your eyes and take several deep breaths, holding"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 each inhalation for 15 to 20 seconds, then releasing each slowly, deepening your relaxation with each breath. Picture yourself in a small boat, gently, lazily floating down a shallow, meandering stream. In the boat, you are in a day-dreaming state of mind, wondering about your question from time to time, wondering about the obstacle that you wish to uncover. Floating, being curious, meditating...your boat drifts onto a white, sandy beach. You leave the boat and follow a path leading to a beautiful waterfall with a rainbow-like mist. Another path takes you behind the waterfall, where, on a ledge, you find a cave. In the cave are two small trunks. Begin image streaming. Describe the first trunk in great detail: size, shape, texture, weight. Mentally pose the question you have been meditating on two or three times. Keep image streaming and suddenly lift the lid of the first trunk. The answer to your question—“What is my obstacle?”—is con - tained inside the trunk. Approach the second trunk and image stream again. Quickly open the lid and your image streaming will provide the answer to the question “What is the best thing I can do to deal with this roadblock?” T echnique # 3: This is called the Mirror Technique. Begin with your ques - tion. Ponder, wonder, meditate. Relaxing, never rushing, picture yourself standing before a full-length mirror. Image stream the description of your reflection in the mirror for one or two minutes. Then mentally turn your back to the mirror. Pose your questions three or four times. Don’t anticipate a possible answer. Then, after repeat - ing your question, suddenly turn and look at the reflection of yourself, which will change or transmute into an image, symbol or scene represent - ing the answer you are seeking. Goal Setting (Side 5) Do this exercise only when you have 20 to 30 minutes of uninterrupted time. Get two large sheets of drawing paper and a box of crayons or several colored pencils. In the center of one sheet, draw yourself the way you see yourself today. Accentuate or diminish the parts of your body you feel you think too much or too little of or about. Be as honest as you can; no one else will see your drawings. In the space around the representation of your body, draw your friends,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 f a m i l y , children, job, other things in your life that are important to you. State their importance to you by their proximity to your own body or by their size. For example, if your spouse is the most important person in your life, make him or her very near your drawing of yourself, as well as very large. Include both positive and negative aspects of your life in this drawing, and use different colors representing your feelings about each. On your second sheet of paper, draw the ideal you, the way you’d like to be (although it is important that you remain realistic about this). Do you want to be healthier, trimmer? Do you want to be happier? Do you want to emphasize your heart more than your head? Again, include the people and things in your life, placing them according to the importance you would like each to have in the future. Do you want a new house? Do you want to be closer to your spouse? Do you want to replace your old job with something new and more exciting? Hold on to both drawings and pull them out to make additions or changes if you are so inspired. The differences between the two drawings will represent the goals you desire. Visualization—Four Techniques (Side 6) Mult ip le Tim e Pro gramming: If you want something wit hin a certain time limit, visualize your desired outcome and having it by that date. Always begin each imaging sequence with feelings, with emotional intensity. Keep the emotional intensity while you program or visualize the details of whatever it is that you want. Bring in all five senses to program the image for approximately 30 seconds. Go back into your past and recreate the events that would support the achievement of your goal. In other words, recreate a past that would be compatible with your desired future. Then project yourself into the future six months or so after you have achieved your goal. Visualize that scene in great detail. Multiple Space Programming: Begin by feeling the emotional intensity associated with achieving your goal, then sense your desired outcome through the camera lenses of your eyes. What does this situation look like? Then pop outside your body and look at yourself from a different perspec - tive. What do you look like in this situation?"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Keep changing perspectives, angles, spatial orientations. Outside your body, inside your body, outside your body, etc. Multiple Energy Programming: Starting with your feelings, select an end-goal picture of what you want. Then project a beam of energy from your forehead, like a movie projector, so you will see your desired outcome outside your head, six to eight feet in front of you. Project a second beam of energy or light from your heart, projecting the same image and overlapping with the first. Follow these with a third beam of energy from your solar plexus, overlapping with the first two images. Intensify the three beams of energy and the end-goal picture into a highly compressed holographic 3-D image. For the next 30 seconds, with gusto and joy, program from your mind, your heart and your solar plexus so that you are imaging and visualizing from three different energy sources with you. Snapshot T e c h n i q u e : Select a single scene of what you want. Keep it simple. Decide whether you want your visualization of it to be like a polaroid photo or an action sequence, like you would take with a video cam - era. Once you decide, do not change the image. Start with the emotions of success, joy, happiness, inner peace, then with gusto stitch in the details. Surge the image into your subconscious for 30 seconds. Creating a Spiral of Success (Side 7) T ake several sheets of paper and, sitting quietly and alone, write as fast as you can what you really want your future to contain. Do not think too hard about it, and do not censor anything. There are no restraints. Then, take some time to prioritize your dreams. Determine if any of them may be symptoms or symptomatic of a deeper, latent dream that has been lying dormant without too much thought or life being breathed into it. Select six to ten of these dream seeds. Opposite each, designate if it is a short-term goal (one that can be achieved in up to six months), a mid-term goal (six to 24 months ) or a long-term goal (anything over 24 months). Once you have prioritized and time-lined your dreams, became aware of all the automatic behavior or subconscious conditioning of your attitudes, beliefs and habits that might stand in the way of successful outcomes. Being aware of these “roadblocks” will allow you to select positive attitudes and beliefs which are conducive to your spiral of success."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 Enhancing Self-Esteem—Four Techniques (Side 8) T echnique # 1: Go into your magical garden and find a very special pond with a calm surface. Gaze at this calm surface, which represents your con - scious mind, and think about the depth of the pond, which represents your subconscious. Drop a beautiful stone, representing inner confidence, into the pond of your mind, and let it sink deeper and deeper, anchoring itself deep within your psyche. Then wrap your consciousness or outer mind around this stone, allowing it to become the source for inner strength, confidence and other related qualities that you wish to strengthen in yourself. Y ou may then drop other stones into your pond, stones representing happi - ness, mental calmness, concentration, etc., for ego enhancement and self- esteem. T echnique # 2: Consider a time in your life when mentally and intellectu - ally you were at your best, when you could take on any mental challenge. That time could be in the past, it could be today. Hold that image of yourself in your mind’s eye and pump it into your subconscious with gusto for about 30 seconds, stimulating your deeper self to help you rediscover that state of grace. Then, think of a time in your life when physically you were strong, healthy and proud of your body image. Pump that image into your subcon - scious. Next, think of a time in your life when you were most emotionally grounded—loving and loved. Bring that image into your mind’s eye and hold it for 30 seconds. T echnique # 3: Go to your magical garden and notice off to one side is a large multi-colored hot-air balloon tethered down by weights and sandbags. W alk over to the basket beneath the balloon and inside it place any self- doubts, old issues of martyrhood, shame, feelings of powerlessness, etc., so that you can lighten your load and feel really good about yourself. As you do, imagine and feel—really feel—increased confidence, power, assertive- ness, joy and happiness. Untie the ropes and watch the balloon filled with your unresourceful behavior gently float away, never to return. T echnique # 4: Go into your magical garden and put yourself into a deeply relaxed state. Go inside your head and picture your brain. From within the very center of your brain, sense a small crystal-clear spring of water gently rising and overflowing from the top of your head like"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 a small fountain. Feel or sense the water flushing the residue and sludge of negative attitudes out of every part of your brain. Once all of this is flushed out and the water coming out of the top of your head is pure and clear, fill your head with a powerful, brilliant, white healing light. Transformational Imagery for Self-Healing (Side 8) Begin by going into your magical garden. Take three or four minutes to pro - gressively relax all of your muscles, then mentally go to wherever your symptom is in your body. Ask your subconscious to transmute the symptom or health problem into an image or symbol representing it. This usually takes no more than 20 to 25 seconds. Then, mentally talk to the symptom/symbol. Ask it where it came from, why it is here and what needs to happen for it to leave. Once the answers to these questions become clear, ask your deeper self to provide you with a healing image. Superimpose that healing image over the symptom image and allows the two to interact for 30 to 60 seconds. Managing Stress (Side 8) First pick a mantra or focus word that might represent a quality you wish to reinforce in yourself, such as “peace,” “calm” or “love.” Find a quiet envi - ronment and sit comfortably in a chair, spine erect, head upright, both feet on the floor, your hands comfortably at your side or on your lap. Close your eyes and progressively relax all your muscles from head to toe by moving your awareness into different muscle groupings. Breathe slowly and naturally, as you inhale, clear your mind as best you can. As you exhale, silently repeat your focus word or mantra. If other thoughts creep in, assume an “oh well” attitude and return to your meditation. Practice 10 to 15 minutes once or twice a day.

Just before returning to your alert consciousness, ask your uncon- scious to continue dreaming your dream for you. In a week or 10 days, go back into your garden and into your unconscious, and pick up where you left off. Dream the next segment of your dream for 20 minutes or so, moving it forward in time. Continue this process once or twice a week, always picking up where you left off from the last dream.
