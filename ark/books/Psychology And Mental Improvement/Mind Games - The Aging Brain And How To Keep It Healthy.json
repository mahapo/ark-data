WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK Regardless of your age, have you ever experienced what may be affectionately described as “senior moments?” For exam- ple, have you • Checked three or four times to make sure that the same appliance is turned off before you leave home? • Tried to use a word in your conversation that you know you know but cannot recall? • Walked up and down the parking lot looking for your car, with the grocery sacker tagging along behind? • Forgotten someone’s name you just met, even though you were rehearsing it while you were walking away? • Had someone tell you that you do not correctly remem- ber what he or she told you? ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x• Preface Or, you may be apprehensive of your ability to adapt to new situations. Are you concerned that rusty brain cells may prevent you from successfully • Moving to a new home or city? • Joining a special-interest group to meet new friends? • Earning a degree or enrolling in a continuing-educa- tion course? • Applying for a new job? • Managing your business and/or life? Well, if you answered “yes” to any of these questions or have similar worries in your life, it’s not hopeless. This book is just what you need. It explains why these “senior moments” occur and how you can take charge of your mental agility. You just need to exercise those brain cells to become more mentally alert and agile. Athletes train and maintain their bodies in peak operating condition. You need to train and maintain your brain. Keep in mind — pardon the pun — that this text is not just a book to improve your memory. It is designed to give you pertinent information regarding the quality of your life. You’ll find information such as • Why certain aspects of your thinking processes are more finely tuned than others • What the latest learning theory is, explained in layper- son’s terms, based on recent brain research • How diet affects your memory and capacity to think • How physical exercise relates to mental exercise • Why research regarding the effects of aging is, in many cases, seemingly contradictory • How the suggested strategies, games, and activities can increase your thinking and memory capacity • Exactly how to regain and maintain your mental agility We’ll guide you through the learning-style preferences and the mental-processing modes that will promote the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Preface • xi most mental gr owth for you. You’ll be able to apply these learning techniques and strategies to all aspects of your life — excelling at work, returning to school, learning a hobby, over- coming drastic changes in your health, and more. This book is designed for middle-aged adults, senior citizens, healthcare professionals, and home caregivers. THE RESEARCH BASIS The Seattle Longitudinal Study, a program conducted for more than 40 years by K. Warner Schaie, PhD., an Evan Pugh Professor at Pennsylvania State University, charted the course of selected cognitive abilities as the study population aged. After noting the decline in mental acuity in elders, Schaie, along with Dr. Sherry Willis, instituted a five-hour training session with specific mental exercises. The exercises ad- dressed inductive reasoning techniques and spatial relation- ship skills, among others. After that period, the majority of the people trained demonstrated that they had regained and could continue to maintain the same mental agility they had exhibited 14 years ago. Based on Schaie’s work, the results of comparable re- search, and our combined 47 years of teaching expertise, this text is designed to assist you in regaining and main- taining the mental agility you may have lost. It also will help you successfully pursue lifelong learning. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK Chapter 1 begins with a look at how you as an individual prefer to learn. Chapters 2 through 4 continue with a physi- cal description of how the brain functions. You then exam- ine the effects commonly associated with the aging process (Chapter 5) and then rapidly proceed to specific measures you easily can use to regain and maintain mental agility (Chapters 6 and 7). This text builds a concrete foundation by explaining the premise on which all of the learning and re- tention strategies are based."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii • Preface If you are a sequential learner (one who starts at the be- ginning and performs each step along the way), you will progress through the chapters, and by the time you reach Chapter 6, you will fully understand the relevance of the games, exercises, projects, hobbies, and activities the text recommends. Nonsequential learners (those who look for a specific topic and start there) who skip directly to Chapter 6 will discover many references back to explanations in earlier chapters. As you become more interested in the material presented, you easily can refer back to the applicable foun- dation theory. Whether you are a sequential or nonsequential learner, we strongly recommend that you eventually read all of the chapters to receive the full benefit of the information. We present key concepts at the beginning of each chap- ter. After you identify a favored learning style, icons direct you to the appropriate learning activity. For example, nu- merous diagrams, photographs, and illustrations guide the learning for readers who have difficulty visualizing infor- mation from text. Inserts highlight special enrichment con- cepts and role-model experiences. To support the text, we have set up a Web site with ani- mations that are keyed to text explanations. Interactive games for mental exercises described in the text also are available on the Web. All of the exercises, games, and learn- ing strategies directly affect specific areas of the brain and allow for growth and development of widely applicable learning and retention skills. You will find a supplement at the Web site with teaching strategies and ideas applicable for a classroom setting or discussion group. Visit www. mentalagility.com .

However, after you understand the reason- ing behind the techniques, you will begin applying them to situations independent from the book — while at work, dri- ving, fishing, or shopping. If you practice these techniques, they will make a difference in your life and improve the quality of your lifestyle. You will feel in control again. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND HOME CAREGIVERS This text supports a continuing-education class on assisting seniors to regain their mental acuity. The material is pre- sented clearly in layperson’s terminology, laced with humor and everyday application strategies. Students in the class will enjoy group discussions of their experiences. The exer- cises and activities in this book easily may be adapted to group activities. For those of you who care for another person in the home, this book can help provide assistance in explaining the reasons for that person’s apparent decline and in select- ing activities to help reverse the process. Healthcare professionals serving the elder population may use this text to supplement the daily routine of their el- derly patients in group sessions. Some elderly patients may prefer to use the text on an individual basis instead of in a classroom setting. If your patients have physical complica- tions and cannot read, you should read through the entire book prior to meeting with them about this topic. Explain Chapters 1 through 4 and help them with the tests on learn- ing preferences in Chapter 1. It might help them to know many of the aspects of aging, such as why food doesn’t seem to interest them as it used to. You’ll find this informa- tion in Chapter 5. As the healthcare giver, you will need to evaluate your patient and choose appropriate exercises, games, and activities from all the chapters, but especially those in Chapters 4, 6, and 7."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SUMMARY This book gives you proven techniques that will help reju- venate the minds of those who perform the exercises.

Once selected, some information passes from imme- diate memory — that is, what you can sense — into short-term or holding memory. Finally, a small amount of the original information makes it to permanent long-term memory. The final move to long-term memory is what we call learning. In this chapter, you will learn how information is captured, se- lected, and stored. 1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CAPTURING INFORMATION You obtain information through your five senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Imagine yourself watching a television program about your favorite hobby. You see and hear the information. You receive this information in an auditory manner (you hear it) and visually (you see it). These delivery methods, using only two of your five senses, are how the majority of people believe information is taught and learned. The truth is that a great deal of information is conveyed to you through your other senses: smell, taste, and touch. Olfactory (smell) and gustatory (taste) sensations are more rarely used in formal learning activities than hear- ing and sight. However, people rely extensively on these senses in the home and at work (detecting smoke, gas leaks, cooking, and so on). You know the old adage, “The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach!” Your sense of touch also tells you a great deal about the world around you. You use it to check a child’s temperature, the fineness of your handiwork, or the car’s vibration. Your sense of touch is intricately involved in your kinesthetic (mo- tor) skills with which you write, learn a new hobby, drive, get dressed, and many, many other physical activities. Some emotional information is communicated through touch, such as a gentle pat or a warm, loving hug. 2• Chapter 1 I s e n s e i t ! I k n o w i t !

People are talking, dishes and utensils are clinking, and music is playing softly in the background. Soft candlelight illuminates silk-covered furnishings while the aroma of dinner fills the air. All of these impressions saturate your five senses, which trans-fer as much information as they can to the brain via what is called the sensory store. These fleeting sensations re- main for only a few milliseconds before the majority of the sensations are lost and only a small subset is passed on to short-term, or working, memory (STM). The information is lost within 15 to 30 seconds if not selected for closer consid- eration. If you were not paying attention to a conversation, you could reconstruct a recent comment if asked within this 15 to 30 second window. However, after this brief interval of time, you must begin to organize and rehearse the informa- tion you want to store in long-term memory (LTM). The process of learning new information does not stop when we go to sleep. Recent research indicates that sleep is essential to the formation and efficient storage of memories. As we sleep, the brain appears to replay the activities of the day, re- activating old and activating new brain cell connections. With proper encoding and retrieval strategies, information that is stored in LTM is considered relatively permanent be- cause it can be recalled years later. 1 Sleep is essential to the formation and efficient stor- age of memories. The overwhelming mode of human communication is a mix of verbal and visual information. Figure 1-1 shows brain images, which demonstrate the different parts of the brain that are active when listening to words and looking at words. Notice that if material is presented orally, the brain reacts as shown in Figure 1-1a, whereas if material is presented vi- sually, the brain reacts as shown in Figure 1-1b.

Some people prefer to listen to new information and are called auditory learners, whereas others prefer to see the new information and are described as visual learners. If you listen primarily to words on the radio, on television, and in con- versation, the sections of your brain that are activated (Hearing Words, as shown in Figure 1-1a) become stronger, just as the specific muscles a body builder exercises grow stronger. Similarly, when you see the words, the sections of your brain that are activated (Seeing Words, as shown in Figure 1-1b) become stronger. Still other people prefer to write down new information or to practice a new skill and are classified as kinesthetic learners. You may prefer to learn using only one of the audi- tory, visual, and kinesthetic techniques. The white areas in Figure 1-2 show the regions of brain activity for auditory, vi- 4• Chapter 1 Figure 1-1a Hearing Words Figure Figure 1-1b Seeing Words Figure"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"sual, and kinesthetic (motor) stimulation. Different areas of the brain respond to different delivery formats. In this text, you will see several PET scans, so a descrip- tion of the technique might be helpful. A radioactive sub- stance with a short half-life is injected into the bloodstream using glucose as the carrier. The radioactivity allows external monitoring of the metabolism of the brain. Sensors around the volunteer’s head monitor the radioactivity. Computers convert the information into two-dimensional images. The more active an area of the brain, the more glucose it uses, and the brighter the color. In black-and-white pictures, the more active areas show up whiter. The other areas of the brain are not dormant. They are simply not as active. Begin to notice how you prefer to have information pre- sented. You may prefer to use a combination of auditory, vi- sual, and kinesthetic (motor) methods. For example, you might repeat a written list aloud while marking items off on your fingers. Do you want someone to give you written di- rections rather than to tell you how to get somewhere? Would you rather listen to a book on tape than to read a book? Do you move or shift around, adjust your tie, twirl your hair, or otherwise “fidget” when concentrating? Do you believe you are an auditory, visual, or kinesthetic learner?

The other two styles probably did not have a score of zero. So, there are some situations where you prefer to use the other two styles. One of the authors typically tests as visual (when forced to select just one choice) but knows in her gut that she is strongly kinesthetic as well. She has to write things down to learn them, and if she does not do the driving cannot return to a location. Most people, in fact, rely on these three tech- niques to different degrees at different times. For example, to remember an errand that must be run, you may repeat it to yourself several times, while a trip to the hardware store for supplies may prompt you to write a list. You can train yourself to rely extensively on more than one modality to process information and create memories. The more you combine these modalities, the more efficient you will be at storing and recalling information. USING LEARNING STYLES To use your brain more fully, you need to use combinations of these methods to learn and recall pertinent information. Using a combination of visual and auditory methods creates more connections in the brain than using just one method. The more connections you use to store information, the more likely you will be able to recall it when required. A friend of ours repeats to herself the thing she is trying to remember to do in an interesting rhyme or pattern (audi- tory), writes it down on a piece of paper and puts it next to her place mat where she will see it (visual and kinesthetic), and then tells her husband to remind her (auditory). The in- teresting thing is that she knows her husband will never re- mind her (he won’t remember later), and he knows she doesn’t really expect him to remind her (so he doesn’t bother storing it). She never forgets anything! Are you surprised? Why is it important in everyday life to be aware of learn- ing preferences? We often think of learning as taking place in a formal environment such as a classroom or work. Nev- ertheless, we learn new information every day.

Sometimes it is the new phone number of our best friend (which we do not want to forget). Many times, we are not learning the information. We want someone else to remember something. If you notice the little signals indicating someone’s dominant learning preference, you can present the information in the style that person needs. The authors were part of a team conducting a national workshop for engineering professors. One of the things we taught them was to identify their learning style. One of the professors confessed that he was strongly kinesthetic. But what he thought so funny was that he now understood why his students would be so frustrated. They would come up to him after class, and no matter what the question was, he al- ways tried to draw some sort of a picture to represent the question. They did not want a picture; they wanted him to clarify what he had said earlier. He needed to adjust his pre- sentation style to match his students’ learning style.

First, if you need to learn some new information in a quick and thorough man- ner, plan learning activities that maximize your dominant style. • If you are a visual learner, feast your eyes with images and lots of text. • If you prefer to learn in an auditory way, try books on tape or recite your lessons aloud. Use your voice and your ears to help you use this preferred style. • A kinesthetic learner will want to devise activities where movement and touch are required. Make mod- els, write notes, and use your hands to describe things to others and yourself. Second, learn to develop your skills in the other two, less-dominant, learning styles. Life events often require you to use your nondominant style and still be effective at re- taining information. You may be reading a magazine article, which supports a visual learner. You may be in an audito- rium listening to someone speaking, which supports an au- ditory learner. You may be in a hands-on class, which supports a kinesthetic learner. It will be useful to you if you can benefit from all three styles. Accommodate your personal preferences and begin to include others. If you have never been an avid reader, for ex- ample, find a subject you enjoy and start reading.

It is also common knowledge that exercise benefits our overall health and can help us to resist the effects of aging on our bodies. Intimate knowledge of how our brain operates, ages, and repairs itself is not as common. Before you can take control of your mental processes, you must understand how the brain works.

While you were reading, whether or not you previously knew about the concept of learning styles, did you wonder why we have different learning pref- erences? Is one child born to be a visual learner, another an auditory learner, and still another a kinesthetic learner? Is this a preference we develop? Is it a preference we can in- fluence or change? To answer these questions, this chapter will tell you how the brain works. You will discover how your brain develops as you grow, and how different parts of your brain react while you are performing a variety of activities. You also will see how through disease, damage, or disuse, mental ability may be impaired or lost. This book is not intended to aid those who have lost mental ability due to disease or trau- matic damage. However, it will show you how you can re- cover loss of mental ability as a result of disuse. Many old notions about the brain and how we learn have been overturned during the past Decade of the Brain. It was commonly thought, for example, that we had only a fixed number of brain cells and that when we lost them to disease, trauma, or old age, we did not replace them in the way we renewed other body cells. We believed that brain cells could be destroyed but not replaced. We also antici- pated that we would lose some of our mental agility as a normal result of the aging process. Brain research in this decade reversed those notions. Research just recently indi- cated that certain areas of the brain, such as the hippocam- pus, can generate replacement cells throughout your life span. 1 We also know now that we can grow new connections between the brain cells at a rapid rate if we use our brains in new and novel ways, regardless of our age . In the same manner that understanding how an engine functions helps a mechanic to fine-tune a motor, understand- ing the functions of your brain will aid you in fine-tuning your mental abilities. Accordingly, some groundwork must be laid before delving directly into the many methods you can use to counteract the effects of aging on your mental processes. 22 • Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN Let’s get started. Pictures of the brain are all around us in newspapers, magazines, and on television. Therefore, you probably already have a general idea of what the brain looks like. We’re going to probe deeply into the structure of the brain so that you will know precisely why we want you to practice certain strategies and techniques and exactly what is happening as you reinforce your mental agility. Let’s start with some of the vocabulary and imagery needed to talk about and visualize brain structure. neuron — nerve cell in the brain The neuron is the basis of the brain. It is estimated that the brain contains 100 billion neurons, which is roughly equivalent to the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. 2 Each neuron is a nerve cell composed of a center, named the nucleus, with long, slender axons and short, bristly dendrites. axon — messenger of the brain dendrite — message receiver in the brain Neurons communicate with each other by passing nerve impulses down the axon of one neuron. At the end of each axon is a minute gap called the synapse synapse — gap between axon and dendrites As the nerve impulse reaches the end of the axon, a chemical, called a neurotransmitter, is released into the synapse. On the other side of the synapse is a dendrite of an- other cell that acts as the receiver for the signal. neurotransmitter — a chemical released by the axon to send and store messages across a synapse In Figure 2-1, you can see the path the message follows from one neuron to another. This message travels from one The Intelligent Mind • 23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"neuron out its axon, is transmitted over the synapse, and travels up one of the dendrites of another neuron on its way to its destination. The message may be passed from neuron to neuron until it reaches the final destination. On the other hand, the neurotransmitters released into the synapse may alert multiple neurons at the same time. These message path- ways are called connections. connections — message pathways in the brain Also present in the spaces between the neurons are tril- lions of glial cells, from the Greek word for glue. These cells support, sustain, and safeguard the neurons and may have a communications system of their own. glial — glue-like cells that form a support for the neurons The neurotransmitter performs a critical function in the cre- ation of these communications connections. Each time a mes- sage is transmitted between cells, the chemical that is released into the synapse physically changes the receptor dendrite. Bristly spikes build on the dendrite as a result of the interaction of the chemical neurotransmitter and the dendrite. It is the rep- etition of this chemical reaction along the message route that strengthens the connection. You will learn in Chapter 4, “De- velop a Brawny Brain,” how to use rehearsal to make a mem- ory stronger. (Visit the Web site www.mentalagility.com to view an animation of this phenomenon.) 24 • Chapter 2 Axon Message Pathway Dendrite Figure 2-1 Connections between brain cells"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The basis for these communications connections already can be identified approximately 10 weeks after conception when the brain is merely one-half inch long. 3 Neurons begin pushing their way from the neural tube deep within the inte- rior of the fetus’s brain to the outside margins, with newer neurons pushing past older neurons. Neurons travel along glial fibers much like traveling down a highway toward their final destination with the assistance of proteins and chemical cues. 4 By five months into the pregnancy, the fetus’s brain is now two inches long, and the migration of neurons to the outer layers of the brain is almost complete. 5 Early Brain Development During development, a baby’s brain is a maze of neurons much different in structure from the adult’s brain. One in- teresting example is vision development. To develop vision, nerve fibers from the retina must grow to extend far enough through the brain to reach the visual thalamus (see Figure 2-2), and from there, axons reach to the outer layers of the cortex, before the cortex even exists. cortex — the folded outer layer of the brain A study by Carla J. Shatz, 6 professor of neurobiology at Stanford University, demonstrated the existence of transient support “scaffolding” in the developing brain that aids in de- veloping vision but disappears after the brain’s growth is fin- ished. Special types of neurons, subplate neurons, suddenly appear just below the final destination at the visual cortex and function to bolster and direct the axons to their proper location. Then these subplate neurons disappear. These and other neurons that act as temporary support structures, along with the proteins and chemical cues previously men- tioned, prevent the axons from wandering into incorrect ar- eas and impairing brain functions. Some disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and dyslexia are thought to be a result of wandering axons or improper connections. 7 The Intelligent Mind • 25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"At birth, the brain weighs approximately three-quarters of a pound.

Stimulation, includ ing touching, speaking to the baby, and presenting different images, helps the brain in- crease efficiency and select correct sites. Research demon- strates that babies who are not stimulated have brains 20 percent to 30 percent smaller than normal. 8 This process of stimulation and mental reaction is much like fine-tuning a station on the old-style radio dial: If the message gets close to the proper site, but not exactly where it needs to be, the result is not as clear as if the tuning were exact. Each time the message is sent, the tuning becomes more effective, un- til at last, with sufficient testing of the connections, the sig- nal is processed clear and free of static. From birth, the baby learns to be efficient at transferring auditory, visual, and/or kinesthetic information. As you read to a child and point out the words, you are stimulating the auditory and visual aspects of learning. Taking a child’s hand and tracing the letters reinforces the kinesthetic quali- ties. It is important that the child is exposed repeatedly to all the learning preferences in order to fine-tune the circuits used for each technique (more on that in just a bit). The more techniques the child can call upon during the school years, the more likely the child will be considered a success in the traditional school setting. The traditional school set- ting primarily supports visual and auditory learners. As the brain learns what the correct representations are and which paths are most efficient at transmitting this in- formation, it keeps the most-effective pathways and prunes the less-efficient ones. Connections, which are used on a reg- ular basis and thus become fine-tuned, are retained, while other connections, which are inefficient or not used at all, are eliminated. 9 As many as 600 connections may be elimi- nated per second during this pruning period. After the synapses and axons are operating correctly, the efficiency of the mental processing is dependent on genetic, environ- mental (including nutritional and sociological), psychologi- cal, and educational factors. 10 The Intelligent Mind • 27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The time after birth is extremely critical. For the first cou- ple of years, the child’s brain is most malleable. After ap- proximately 8 to 10 years of age, the brain is not as adaptable to change. That is why young children who suffer brain in- juries recover more quickly and completely than adults with the same brain injuries. We begin to develop our learning preferences before we reach school age. We already know whether we like to learn and how we want to go about it be- fore we ever reach kindergarten. This is why the quality of the interactions of the parents or caregivers with the child are extremely critical to the learning process and the future success of the student. If you have been successful in learn- ing in formal school settings, you probably are successful in real-life settings such as your job. If you have been unsuc- cessful in learning in the past, or if you are experiencing dif- ficulty holding on to information from day to day, you can improve your capabilities. You can literally “change your mind” and be more efficient and reliable. But assuming you are an adult, you need to know the facts about how your brain operates in order to affect the processes. Please keep readin g... The Adult Brain By the time the baby becomes an adult, the brain weighs ap- proximately three pounds. This increase in weight is due to the increase in neuron size and the tremendous increase in the number of connections formed among the neurons since birth. Imagine trying to take billions of neurons formed in layers and trying to fit them into the skull. It is similar to try- ing to fit a piece of newspaper into a small box. Crumpling it in on itself would be a good solution. The layers of neu- rons form the gray matter and enfold the trillions of axons passing through the brain and interconnecting the neurons. The myelin sheaths covering the axons are white; this region therefore is described as white matter. 11 The cortex makes up 80 percent of the brain’s volume and is the convoluted mass normally imagined when the word “brain” is mentioned. 28 • Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The grooves and folds, named sulci and gyri, respectively, that appear on the surface of the cortex are used as land- marks or reference points to locations within the brain (see Figure 2-3). sulci — grooves in the cortex gyri — folds in the cortex One of the deepest of the sulci divides the cortex from the front to the back into two hemispheres. The two hemi- spheres are connected primarily by a thick bundle of nerves named the corpus callosum , (See Figure 2-4). Just as bodies have the same general configuration (the head bone’s connected to the neck bone, the neck bone’s connected to the shoulder bon e...), everybody’s brain has the same anatomical parts. Each of us has two hemispheres, a corpus callosum, grooves, and folds. These grooves (sulci) and folds (gyri) are so standardized in location that they are used as landmarks or reference points to locations and ac- tivities within the brain.

The more basic functions of life, such as breathing, are located close to the base and the spinal column in the brainstem.

The Hemispheres Common phrases overheard these days are right-brained and left-brained. These phrases refer to the primary location for spe- cific mental activities within the brain structure (see Figure 2- 5). The left hemisphere communicates with and controls the right side of the body, while the right hemisphere communi- cates with and controls the left side of the body. Although both hemispheres communicate with each other and share some functions, one hemisphere is considered dominant. The dom- inant hemisphere is the site for thought processes more in- volved in detailed and sequential analysis. 30 • Chapter 2 Corpus Callosum Left Hemisphere Right Hemisphere Figure 2-4 The hemispheres and their bridge, the corpus callosum"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Whichever hemisphere is dominant, it is the other hemi- sphere that holds appreciation of forms and humor, mental arousal, physiological readiness to respond, orientation in space, recognition of voice timbre, musical talent, and ap- preciation of things that do not lend themselves to verbal descriptions. 12 This hemi sphere is considered to be the home site for global thought processes that can be described as the “Aha!” response, which is exhibited when a sudden under- standing of a concept occurs without the ability to describe how the understanding was achieved. It often is assumed that the left hemisphere controls the verbal and analytical processes, while the right hemisphere handles the artistic, emotional, abstract relationships. This is true for only a por- tion of the population. There are some clues, however, as to which hemisphere is dominant.

One percent of the right-handed population and 44 percent of the left- handed population write with the hand in an inverted posi- tion (see Figure 2-6). Dr. Jerre Levy performed experiments that revealed that the inverted hand position is a biological marker indicating that the hemisphere considered dominant for analytical specialization is on the same side as the writ- ing hand. For those people who write with the hand in a noninverted position, the hemisphere opposite that hand is dominant. For discussion purposes, and because it is the case for most of the population, we will consider the left hemisphere of the brain to be the site for verbal and analyt- ical abilities for the rest of this text. We have all heard jokes regarding the differences be- tween men and women. There is a biological basis for many of the qualities men and women find confusing about each other. For example, men and women differ at a very basic level from the description just given for the dominant hemi- sphere. While men’s verbal abilities are predominantly 32 • Chapter 2 Figure 2-6 Hand position as a marker for hemisphere dominance Noninverted Inverted"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"stored in a centralized location in the left hemisphere, a woman’s verbal abilities are more diffusely located on both sides of the brain. This might explain why men have a slightly more difficult time expressing their emotions. They have to get the emotional information from the right hemi- sphere across the primary bridge (corpus callosum) to their verbal abilities in the left hemisphere, whereas women have some verbal abilities already located on the same side as their emotions. 13 See Chapter 3, “Teach Your Brain Agility,” for more details of gender differences. Each hemisphere is further divided into lobes. Each lobe has generalized functions. The frontal lobes have the capability to plan for the future, control movement, integrate emotional responses, and produce speech. The parietal lobes receive and process information received from the senses — such as pain, taste, and smell — and are involved with logic and mathematical processes. The occipital lobes handle vision. The temporal lobes hear and interpret lan- guage, tones, sound patterns, and music; and participate in emotion. The limbic lobe is responsible for sexual, emotional, and memory processing 14 (see Figure 2-7). Researchers at the University of Toronto’s Baycrest Center for Geriatric Care announced that the frontal lobes are where humor is processed.

When can I start?” (straightfor- ward logical choice) B. “That’s great! I’ll come back in a month.” (correct funny choice — original punch line) C. “Hey boss, your nose is too big for your face!” (slapstick ending — right-frontal damaged patients are likely to choose this one) 15 Now that we have led you through a discussion of the brain’s general anatomy and structure, let’s talk about the brain, learning, and intelligences so that we can apply this in- formation to our learning capability. You know your abilities and talents. Maybe you are talented at fixing things, cooking, writing, solving crossword puzzles, cheering other people up, or gardening. Before you begin reading about intelligences (and all these “talents” are actually forms of intelligence), re- view your skills and abilities. Then see whether you recog- nize yourself in any of these intelligences. The following facts and figures will provide you with some interesting informa- tion if you have ever dealt with someone who has had a stroke or other brain injury. MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES Seven Intelligences Linguistic Bodily-Kinesthetic Musical  Personal Logical-Mathematical Naturalist Spatial As a framework for our discussion of more specific capa- bilities of the brain, we will use Howard Gardner’s theory of 34 • Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"multiple intelligences. 16 Gardner feels that too much impor- tance has been placed on the types of skills and talents required to score well on standardized intelligence tests. A person who scores a high intelligence quotient (IQ) does so as the result of performing well on certain linguistic, spatial, and mathemati- cal tasks. Gardner holds that there are at least seven intelli- gences that should be valued equally: linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalist, and personal (which includes interpersonal and intrapersonal). We will designate general sites for each of these mental activities within the brain. Remember that we are choosing the left hemisphere as the dominant hemisphere. If you are right-hemisphere dominant, you should switch the desig- nated locations shown here to the other side of the brain. Also, when we discuss an activity (for example, mathemat- ics), we will point out the area in which research shows the activity is concentrated. However, when you actually “do math” in a practical application, other areas of the brain, such as language and spatial abilities, usually are involved. One area is not independent of the others. Linguistic Intelligence “The Father of Waters rolls unvexed to the sea” was General Grant’s telegraph to President Lincoln on the fall of Vicks- burg during the Civil War. What a melodic, stunning report. Someone not so facile with the language might have said, “Enemy defeated at Vicksburg. Mississippi River now under Union control.” Lincoln, himself, days later while delivering the Gettysburg Address, used the robust passage “Four score and seven years ago” to replace the austere phrase “In 1776.” Some people, such as Grant and Lincoln, possess such a high linguistic intelligence that their ability to create finely crafted sentences progresses beyond precision and accuracy into the realm of an art form. Whereas the left hemisphere spe- cializes in understanding literal meaning, there is good evi- dence that the right hemisphere helps in understanding and generating metaphors, humor, and irony. Subjects with dam- age to the right hemisphere understand words in an extremely The Intelligent Mind • 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"literal manner. When asked to show appreciation for a perfor- mance and “give someone a hand,” they would try to find a toy hand to give. When asked to complete jokes, the result would be senseless, awkward, and not in the least humorous. 17 The creative ability and imaginative use of words, located largely in the right hemisphere, is the essence that raises tech- nical merit to a creative painting of pictures that evoke strong emotions and vivid interactions. 36 • Chapter 2 Photo courtesy of Khabir the Storyteller, P.O.

Rhetoric — use of language to convince another individ- ual that your opinion is correct 2. Mnemonic — use of language to remember other infor- mation 3. Explanation — use of language for teaching and learning 4. Metalinguistic — use of language for analyzing previous statements for clarification or correction Mastery of language and its uses requires expert knowl- edge and use of phonology (word sounds that interact), se- mantics (the meaning of words), and syntax (rules of word order to use as expected or changed to draw attention to a particular idea or image). Individual elements of a task (in this case, phonology, semantics, and syntax) may be local- ized within a specific area of the brain. These elements and their respective areas are activated in any number of combi- nations to complete that task. The specific areas designated for these three elements are shown in the figure. These areas are referred to as Broca’s area (linguistic production) and Wernicke’s area (compre- hension of linguistics). The area for processing sign language is located just below Wernicke’s area 18 (see Figure 2-8). These areas are not the only ones used for linguistics. Marble-sized areas of neurons, primarily scattered through the left temporal and parietal lobes, specialize in functions such as nouns, individual rules of grammar, and production of verbs.

It is not an act of will but rather a way of life, much like breathing or walking for those of us not so blessed. Many children generate spontaneous songs in their early years, but by the age of six or seven, this ceases for the major- ity. Children then seem to rely primarily on the standardized tunes they are taught. Only a few continue to create music. Most of the information available on music generation comes from observing musicians who have experienced physical trauma to the brain as a result of stroke or other brain damage. Damage to the left hemisphere exhibits aphasia (ver- bal-production impairment) or amusia (musical-production impairment). Subjects could talk coherently and not be able to function musically (amusia) or not be able to verbalize (apha- sia) and still perform or compose. Some people documented in literature have had strokes that affected the left side of their brain, leaving them unable to speak a single word; yet they could sing song after song. Sometimes they required a trigger mechanism, depending on the damage, such as another per- son starting the song or a record to give them a “jog.” Although Dr. Wetzel’s grandmother was not a docu- mented case, her experience is germane. She could not re- spond verbally to any question but could sing her gospel hymns for hours. However, she needed to hear a recording to get her started. In addition, Alzheimer’s patients are often able to sing or play an instrument long after their recogni- tion of friends and families has passed. Although one of the main areas that facilitates music production also assists in verbal skills, music seems to be of the form of a symbolic or graphic system as opposed to an alphabetic, semantic system and thus is related closely to mathematical skills. PET scanning was used in a study performed on 10 right- handed performers, each with at least 15 years of experience and self-rated as good to excellent sight readers. The study included two categories common to all instruments: sight reading and playing the instrument. 19 For this study, the in- 38 • Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"strument was a keyboard. Reading a musical score without playing operates both hemispheres’ visual centers, as ex- pected. Instead of stimulating the linguistic centers, the left occipitoparietal junction, normally used when processing spatial information, is activated. This agrees with the manner in which musicians use distance between notes on the staff to locate the next pitch and supports the theory that spatial abilities are fundamental to musical intelligence. As a matter of fact, the distance from the area of the brain activated when listening to low C to that area activated when listening to middle C is the same distance as that from the area listening to middle C to that listening to high C. 20 The drawing in Figure 2-9 indicates the areas activated when listening to scales. Notice that listening to a musical composition (as opposed to the predictability of scales) acti- vated the same cortical areas and an additional arc in the right hemisphere. Listening to music (scales being classified as practice, not music) affects the emotional and imaginative areas of the right hemisphere, whereas scales do not.

Although music processing is located in both hemispheres, the more experi- enced a musician becomes in processing musical tones, the more the process seems to be located in the left hemi- sphere. 21 As skills become activated automatically, as op- posed to having to concentrate on how to perform the action, they are considered rote performances and become located in a separate area of the brain in the left hemisphere. The area of the brain thought to lift the technically cor- rect per former to the level of an artist is the right hemisphere. Many people can play adequately, but this does not indicate a creative instinct. Those composers and performers who hear their lives as musical interludes have a depth of activation in the right hemisphere that may at various times seem a bless- ing or a burden. Logical-Mathematical Intelligence A pure mathematician deals not so much with numbers, as we remember our arithmetic classes, but with extreme abstractions that are built with reasoning and many lines of proofs into even more abstract results. To many people, these abstractions often seem to have no reference to the “real” world. It may be difficult for many people who have had bad experiences in the past, to think of mathematics as a potential art form. However, as is the case with the other intelligences discussed so far, the creative genius that sparks new theories and applications seems to reside in the right 40 • Chapter 2 Figure 2-9 Left: Listening to scales. Center: Listening to musical scores. Right: Playing music @"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"hemisphere. (A lot of readers would simply like to know where the average mathematical skills are based!) The only available information regarding the location of mathematical abilities is from observation of those individu- als who have suffered damage to the brain through an acci- dent or stroke, or who required surgery. Gerstmann Syndrome is the designation for damage to the left parietal lobes and the temporal and occipital association areas adjoining them (part of the angular gyrus). Damage to these areas reduces the ability to orient oneself in space, understand certain grammatical structures (such as prepositional phrases and passive constructions), tell left from right, and perform nu- merical calculations. It also creates difficulty in drawing. The syndrome is characterized by damaging effects to the associ- ation cortexes in the posterior areas of the dominant hemi- sphere — those associated with recognizing ordered arrays and patterns visually (see Figure 2-10). Deficits in calculation abilities can be grouped into three main categories: 1. Alexic and agraphic acalculia — difficulty in reading and writing numbers 2. Spatial acalculia — difficulty in dealing with the spatial organization of written numbers 3. Anarithmetria — difficulty with the calculation itself The first two types of deficits (difficulty in visualizing numbers) are linked to the visual system and/or associative memory areas. Damage to the posterior portion of the left hemisphere, near Wernicke’s area, results in the calculation disability. Essential to the logical-mathematical ability, the frontal lobes play an important part in organization skills. The ability to plan a strategy to achieve a specific goal is housed in this area. Damage to the frontal lobes leaves an individual with not only an inability to plan a problem-solving strategy but also the inability to set goals and follow through in everyday life. The Intelligent Mind • 41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The ability to handle mathematics successfully is some- what dependent on the strength of the individual’s spatial abilities (as in music). Also of importance is the ability to un- derstand fully numerical relationships and concepts. Be- cause this requires a sense of intuition and feeling instead of sequential proof, this ability is lodged in the right hemi- sphere. Again, this is rather similar to the organization of the brain when dealing with music. Music seems to lend a sense of order and beauty to expressions that mathematicians and scientists enjoy and appreciate. Teaching young children a musical instrument or exposing them to music, especially the classics, helps to organize their thought pro-cesses and make children more successful in mathematics. 22 Spatial Intelligence Second only to research on the linguistic operations of the brain is research regarding spatial abilities. Perhaps so much research is available on spatial abilities because it is some- 42 • Chapter 2 Figure 2-10 Area for mathematical calculation"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"thing, like language, that we are all called upon to use. In addition, this is one of the primary mental abilities often tested on IQ tests. An example of spatial abilities is the capability to answer the question, “Is the top of a horse’s tail located above or be- low the level of its chin?” To answer the question, you must visualize the horse’s formation. Spatial skills consist of abilities to 1. Experience the world in three dimensions. 2. Understand scale models and recognize objects in un- usual orientations. 3. Recall visual images in rich detail. 23 The posterior (rear) portions of the right hemisphere are more crucial for spatial reasoning, although damage to the left hemisphere can cause a slight decrease in this ability. For most individuals, the right hemisphere is dominant (see Fig- ure 2-11). In general, men perform better at spatial tasks, especially rotation of objects, mathematical reasoning, and navigating through a route. Studies have been performed using men and women with normal hormonal levels and women who were exposed to prenatal and neonatal doses of the hor- mone androgen (due to genetic defects or the pregnant mother taking steroids). The increased spatial abilities apply to the women exposed to androgens early in development. Women who had not been exposed to the hormone did not perform as well. However, they did perform better at match- ing items, arithmetic calculation, recalling landmarks on a route, and precision tasks. They also showed greater verbal fluency. Because the hormone testosterone is present in both men and women (at different levels), the next question raised is whether a direct relationship exists between the level of testosterone and spatial ability. Is there an optimum level of the hormone for increased spatial abilities? There is a range on the high end for women’s normal levels and the low end The Intelligent Mind • 43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"for men’s normal levels that is optimum. Too high on the men’s scale or too low on the women’s scale reduces the spatial abilities. An individual’s spatial abilities also fluctu- ate during the normal hormonal cycles for women and men (testosterone levels for men are lower in the spring than in the fall). 24 Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence Not often regarded as an intelligence, body intelligence is the ability to use the body in highly differentiated and skilled ways and the ability to use other objects skillfully. 25 Examples include acting, the skilled movements of the hands and fingers of an instrumentalist, ballet, and gym- nastics. Figure 2-12 shows the primary areas for motor skills and control. The Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) predetermines the general path of a movement or series of movements. Even as 44 • Chapter 2 Figure 2-11 Location of spatial ability in both hemispheres (right dominant)"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"simple a task as waving good-bye can become impossible to perform and impossible to learn if the SMA is damaged. 26 The premotor cortex and the basal ganglia aid in the planning and implementation of the path of the movement. The posterior parietal lobe, important in spatial ability, interacts with the premotor cortex. The process of movement actually is accomplished with two loops through the system: a complex loop and a motor loop. The complex loop begins with instructions from the frontal lobes. The instructions then are fed through the basal ganglia and caudate nucleus portions and are sent to the thalamus. Then the information is fed back through the frontal lobes and into the motor loop. The motor loop begins with M1, where fine motor control is located. Some of the neurons located in M1 have direct access to the spinal col- umn. The cerebellum is included in the pathway, because it appears to be the site of automatic motor responses (those skills that are “second nature”).

Her dad quipped that it would be hard at the beginning, but after a while, it would become automatic. Some activities are performed so often that they become automatic motor responses (such as actions performed by a skilled typist or pianist). The reactions are too quick for true interaction between the stimulus (typing an “a”) and the reasoning abilities (Where is the letter “a” on a keyboard? There it is. Hit it.). When children first begin to write, the shapes and drawing mechanisms for each letter are matters of intense concentration. After years of practice, writing be- comes automatic. The movements are stored in memory as 46 • Chapter 2 Photo courtesy of Amy Aldrich Automatic Motor Response Ball Room Dancing is an example of automatic motor re- sponse (AMR).

These memory associations, thought to be stored in the cerebellum, are like computer routines. The instructions are carried out in a specific order at an ex- tremely rapid pace. Sometimes skills become so automatic that it is difficult to explain the details to someone else. And slowing down the actions to explain the details often causes an error in the process. This explains why most people have difficulty writ- ing with their opposite hand. The instructions in your brain are for the directions and movements of the dominant hand, and at times, you would have to move in a different manner for the other hand. 27 Personal Intelligence Personal intelligence is one of the less distinct and compara- ble intelligences. Personal intelligence consists of intraper- sonal and interpersonal knowledge. Intrapersonal knowledge is knowledge of self — an ability to draw upon, evaluate, and symbolize your own feelings. Examples of intrapersonal experts might be a novelist or a wise elder. Interpersonal knowledge incorporates knowledge of relationships among people; the ability to notice details of others’ feelings, facial expressions, and tone; and the ability to influence others. Ex- amples of interpersonal experts are politicians, teachers, and counselors. The frontal lobes are the meeting place between the in- formation from the posterior regions (involved in process- ing sensory information, including perceptions of others) and the limbic system (involved in motivational and emo- tional functions). Frontal lobes are where the self meets the outside world and the knowledge of self appears to reside. Noticing body language is a major component of interper- sonal knowledge. The ability to notice fine details of the face and expressions is activated in the posterior region of the right hemisphere. This is the same area used to process spa- tial abilities. (Spatial abilities seem to be important for most of the intelligences.) The Intelligent Mind • 47 M"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The intimate knowledge and understanding of your in- ner self, combined with foresight and insight, are essential to interpersonal and intrapersonal expertise. Your emotional behavior and personality, in combination with expert evalu- ative skills (judgment) also are critical to your relationships with others. Figure 2-13 indicates the areas of the brain that regulate these skills. Self-knowledge can be misleading. Take young children, for example. At the age of 6 or 7, children become concerned with the acquisition of skills and knowledge. Peer pressure and the need to please oneself and one’s parents become quite influential. Influence by others that can be destructive at times may include adults and other children dissuading a young girl or boy from an interest in a nontraditional role. The child begins to doubt his or her own interests and abili- ties and chooses a secondary, more acceptable goal. The per- sonal intelligence might be the one most important for each person’s satisfaction with life. Naturalist Intelligence Lately Gardner has been considering other forms of intelli- gences. The newest is that of naturalist intelligence. Not much has been written about this while Dr. Gardner refines his concepts. However, this much is clear: People who pos- sess naturalist intelligence are attuned with nature. We sus- 48 • Chapter 2 ø “The knowledge of self, foresight and insight.” “Personality and judgement” “Emotive behavior ” Figure 2-13"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"pect that they know the names of plants and animals. If they have auditory skills, they likely know birds by their calls. Weather is not a mystery to them. They are always aware of their surroundings and love to spend time outdoors. Their houseplants thrive, and their gardens are stunning. We look forward to learning more about the naturalist as Dr. Gard- ner’s work progresses. MEMORY How do we acquire memories? The memory-formation sys- tem is made up of the hippocampus, the limbic thalamus, and the basal forebrain. Information is obtained through the senses, passed through the memory-formation system, and transferred to permanent storage in the outer layers of the cortex (see Figure 2-14). For information that you need on a temporary basis, nerve cells adjust existing proteins to hold the memory until you no longer need it. Then when the need is over, the neurons return to their original state, and you for- get. If the information is something you want to store per- manently, entirely new types of proteins are manufactured, new genes are “switched on,” and permanent changes to the connections in the structure of the brain are created. 28 So there is a difference in the brain’s activation for a temporary piece of information, such as what you need to buy at the store, and a more permanent memory, such as your new tele- phone number. Recent evidence indicates that the transfer of the infor- mation from the hippocampus to the cortex for permanent storage occurs while we sleep. For the maximum efficiency of memory transfer, you need to have deep sleep within the first two hours of sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep later in the night, preferably toward the end of the sleep cy- cle. The same neurons activated earlier in the day, when the information first was introduced, fire in the same pattern and appear to download the information through the neu- ron connections to the cortex. The Intelligent Mind • 49"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"No matter what our age, we can create new connections within the brain. It is repeated exposure to new information that grows these connections. The more connections we have, the deeper the brain’s resources upon which to call. As adults, we can produce and fine-tune neuron connections much as a baby creates new connections after birth. We also can grow new cells, particularly in the hippocampus (the area helping us to store new memories and continue learning).

MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES INVESTIGATION Recall that Howard Gardner believes that there are at least seven intelligences that should be valued equally: linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalist, and personal.

Some areas of your brain are stronger than others due to use. Remember as you use specific areas of your brain and they receive stimulation from the outside world, axons and dendrites in those areas are created and enlarged. But notice that if you exercise one of your skills, you still may be weak in other areas. That makes sense.

Now one more aspect of the learning process, and you will be fully prepared to tackle the techniques and strategies we present in the following chapters. A complete under- standing allows you to control your own learning processes in day-to-day living and the learning you will be experienc- ing as you read this book. Not only do you have information-delivery sensory pref- erences, you have environmental, emotional, and sociological preferences. 1 These characteristics are controlled by the retic- ular system (physical needs and immediate environment), the 63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"limbic system (emotionality), and the frontal lobe (sociological needs) of the brain (see Figure 3-1).

It then causes us to pay attention to the noise when it changes. The limbic system is considered the source of emotional responses, and the frontal lobe has al- ready been discussed in Chapter 2 as the seat of our knowl- edge of self. 2 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS Your physical preferences include presentation styles, such as the size and legibility of the printed material, pitch or loudness of voices, and comfortable clothes in which to practice. Sometimes we can’t remember things, or we 64 • Chapter 3 Frontal lobe Reticular Formation Limbic System Figure 3-1 Control areas for environmental, emotional and sociological preferences"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"remember them incorrectly, because of the quality of the presentation. For example, if the person’s voice who is giv- ing you an address to remember is pitched too low or they mumble, you may not hear the address or you may interpret it incorrectly. Likewise, struggling to read small print may reduce your efficiency when storing material. Whatever you need to do to reduce the drain on your en- ergies and allow yourself to be more efficient in a learning situation, do it. Here are some strategies others have found successful: • Try large-print books.

You can adjust the volume, and pro- fessional speakers have very clear, precise speech. • If the problem is an auditory one, ask people to speak more clearly or to talk louder. • Some people need to practice something by writing it down. You might try this technique. To help, you might begin to carry a small notebook in your pocket or purse. We all feel that time is too precious to waste! We can be efficient with our learning strategies. If we absorb the infor- mation accurately the first time, we can save ourselves stress and worry. Let’s find the fastest, most effective learning methods for you. After all, if we don’t remember something important, we will be the one who suffers. Don’t spend time being frustrated by something that can be corrected. Circadian Rhythms The time of day affects your ability to function. This is a re- sult of your personal biological rhythms. Circadian rhythms are cycles with a period of about one day. 3 Biological rhythms, especially the Circadian rhythm, are discussed in Teach Your Brain Agility • 65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"more detail in Chapter 6, “Regain an Agile Brain.” You may describe yourself as a morning person, or you may recognize that you are most energetic in the afternoon. Circadian rhythms are becoming increasingly important in the medical field as studies indicate that matching medicinal administra- tion, surgery, and cancer treatments to your circadian rhythm increases the success and survival rate. 4 One exam- ple of the circadian rhythm is that many individuals find their energy level to be at its lowest after lunch. In fact, in tra- ditional Mexican cultures, a siesta is a normal part of their routine. We often assume this is a result of eating. But our en- ergy level does not drop after eating breakfast or supper, so this may be a result of your particular circadian rhythm. Be- cause of circadian rhythms, there are variations in learning readiness as well. Some studies indicate that as we grow older, we begin to prefer the morning hours when energy is at a peak. But this is not true for everyone; others’ energies may peak in the evening. 5 Try to identify your time periods of peak performance. Schedule doctor visits or other important meetings when you are at your energy peak. Luncheons with business as- sociates, relatives, or friends may be better rescheduled to breakfasts or dinners. You want to be at your best when in- teracting with others — not only because you want to leave a good impression, but also because it will help you to inter- act mentally at a higher performance level. A note about circadian rhythms: It is difficult to be sym- pathetic with someone who is two or three rhythms differ- ent from you. It takes patience and understanding to realize that this is a natural pattern, not an indication of another person’s lethargy or excitability!

You may have noticed a pattern to the answer options. All responses to number 1 indicate that you function best in the early morning, 2 in the late morning, 3 midday, 4 midafter- noon, 5 early evening, and 6 late at night. In learning situations, many people want silence in order to concentrate, while others prefer background noise such as music. With the passing of years, a natural preference for background noise may interfere with our ability to learn as our hearing becomes less acute. If you are trying to concen- trate and someone is making too much noise, ask that per- son to be a little quieter. Try earplugs if you need quiet. Other Environmental Effects Other environmental factors that affect our ability to process and retain information are temperature and light. If the surrounding temperature is too high or too low, we are uncomfortable, irritable, easily distracted, and our ability to concentrate lessens. As we age, we require better lighting in order to see more clearly. Proper illumination allows us to see a speaker’s lips to assist our hearing, to read more easily and more quickly, and to perform tasks more accurately. When you are experiencing difficulty concentrating, whether to memorize something or to recall something, check out your environment. Is the temperature comfortable or the light bright enough? Are there too many distractions? Are you struggling to hear or read? Do you need to move around or find a pencil and paper to doodle? You need to ac- commodate your natural preferences and requirements in 68 • Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"order to operate more efficiently. Even if something you want to do seems silly to others, do it. Wouldn’t you rather learn what you need to know? EMOTIONAL EFFECTS Mental abilities decrease more in people who experience negative emotions, such as depression, anxiety, bitterness, and anger, than in those who are happy or content with their lives. Robert Sapolsky, author of Stress, the Aging Brain and the Mechanisms of Neuron Death, theorizes that stress-related release of adrenal hormone bathes the neurons and eventu- ally can damage the brain. 6 Some of emotion’s effects on the brain are merely dis- tracting. Here are a few examples of those effects: • Depression affects your motivation to remember, your ability to concentrate, and your perception of circum- stances. It also can cause overreaction to slight lapses in memory. • Moving to a new home can cause feelings of loneliness, grief, and an inability to concentrate. • Retirement sometimes creates feelings of a lack of pur- pose, sadness, and a sense of loss. • Often as we age, anxiety, loneliness, depression, and feelings of a lack of purpose increase. These negative emotions cause us to disengage from life. Older adults should indeed become more concerned with the quality of life in their golden years. But they should not remove themselves from activities. Better that they recenter on what is important. Once we begin to withdraw from con- tact with others (perhaps because of ill health, a change in fi- nances, moving to another location, or loss of a spouse), it is difficult to force ourselves to resume social interactions. Peo- ple who regularly and actively engage in social interactions have better overall health and well-being than those who do not. And inactivity combined with little or no social contact Teach Your Brain Agility • 69"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"diminishes or eliminates the need to exercise those brain cells and to practice remembering.

Here are some suggestions: • Join a support group. • Enroll in interesting classes. • Make a new friend and learn something new together. • Interact! Work to improve your outlook on life. It will improve your mental capabilities as well! SOCIAL EFFECTS Your personality and sense of responsibility affect not only your relationships with others, your job, and your hobbies, but also your learning abilities and style. Some people are very self-driven. They are more likely to be lifelong learners. Many tend to be independent learners and do not require structured classes with instructors to guide them. Other in- dividuals are peer-oriented and often follow the lead of an- other in unfamiliar situations. They are more likely to benefit from the assistance of a formal teaching environment. They may be less likely to pursue learning throughout life without direct access to formal learning scenarios or the influence of a friend or spouse. It is vital to your health and longevity to remain a life- long learner. Research studies indicate that lifelong learners tend to take better care of themselves, to be more aware of current health issues and breakthroughs, and to show an in- crease in IQ. 7 The increased IQ is extremely pertinent to you. In fact, a study of identical twins demonstrated that when one twin had a noticeably higher IQ score, that twin always lived longer. 8 People who are more intelligent tend to live longer than people who are less intelligent. 70 • Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Teach Your Brain Agility • 71 Photo courtesy of Winfield Leitzer Older and Wiser Bob Gifford, D.Ed., 79, was recruited into a volunteer pro- gram after retiring from 27 years with the county school system.

Some physical dif- ferences show up even before we are born. Gender differ- ences are caused by the effects of both genes and hormones on the developing fetus. (See Chapter 2 for more details re- garding the development of the prenatal child.) Genes alone do not determine the sex of a child. Appropriate hor- monal levels must be present to ensure the proper growth of the fetus. These levels affect the internal wiring of the brain. For example, research indicates that individuals may have the chromosomes of a male, but without the necessary bathing of the fetus with male hormones at each of three critical periods during gestation, the child may appear physically female or may not be as traditionally masculine as expected. 9 From the time of birth, males and females exhibit differ- ent preferences and abilities. In general, men see better in bright light, and women see better in the dark. Women are more sensitive to changes in pitch. As an example, when a woman begins to be annoyed, most of the other women in the room will know this immediately by the tone of her voice. However, the majority of men will not be aware of her annoyance until the change in pitch is much more pro- nounced. It is not that they are not paying attention or ig- noring the annoyed woman’s signals; they just do not detect the slight variations as well as women do. The following table lists a few of the other common differences. 10 72 • Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Men Women See in a narrow field Greater peripheral vision Greater depth perception Less depth perception More sensitive to saltiness More sensitive to sweets Greater preference for sweets Better hand-eye coordination Better at reading facial features Better at spatial abilities, such Prefer to turn a map so that it is as constructing 3D objects from oriented in the same direction as a flat design they are traveling Give directions using north, Give directions using visual cues, south, etc. such as “turn right, there’ll be a white house on the corner” Better at abstract mathematical Better at algebraic processes theories and relationships (better such as adding, dividing, etc. at story problems) More prone to verbal difficulties; Better verbal abilities almost all people who stutter are male 4 out of 5 dyslexics are male Learn to read and write faster Find it easier to master foreign languages These differences in preferential skills and abilities begin to be noticeable soon after birth and continue into adulthood. These preferences affect our abilities to notice details and to communicate in our personal and professional lives; they even affect the strategies we use to achieve success in our choice of goals. These differences between the sexes do not make one sex better than the other. We are different and com- plement each other.

Here are some explanations that might help you under- stand some of the reasons you were forgetting things. Per- haps you lost a spouse to death or divorce, and you were in the habit of depending on that spouse to remember things for you. Grief may cause you to become more easily dis- tracted. Often, when you think you forgot something, or you’re accused of forgetting something, you simply did not pay enough attention to pass the information successfully to long-term memory and then create an association to retrieve it. Most information never makes it to long-term memory. Not paying adequate attention accounts for approximately 50 percent of reported memory problems. However, not only do you need to get the information successfully trans- ferred to long-term memory, but you must be able to re- 76 • Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"trieve it. Thus, you need an incentive to make it worthwhile to concentrate, store the information, and create an associa- tion to retrieve it. The incentive may be job security, pride, or health, for example.

In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to basic storage and retrieval techniques that you can use as part of your mental-agility exercise program. More advanced variations of these techniques and exercises are presented in greater detail in Chapters 6, “Regain an Ag- ile Brain,” and 7, “Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility.” Mental exercises can take many forms: brain teasers, games, puzzles, bridge, going back to school, and more. Learning something new, whether in a formal school setting or independently, is an excellent exercise. Distinct areas of the brain are activated as you graduate from a novice to a more experienced level in mastery of a technique or subject. Figure 4-1 is a PET scan that demonstrates the various areas of the brain that are energized and exercised when a linguis- tic technique is introduced. The subject is observed while still a novice and unpracticed, versus when he or she is experi- 80 • Chapter 4 Figure 4-1 PET scan of brain activity of novice compared to expert"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"enced and practiced. Notice that as you become familiar with a topic, the area of the brain being used will change. Re- member from the first two chapters, though, that the areas of the brain that are activated depend on what you are learning and how you are going about learning it. Remember when you last learned something new? Per- haps it was learning a new dance step, making a new recipe, or trying to use a new piece of equipment. Try to think of that last thing you learned. Check as many as apply to you. Did you have to: _____ Learn new words? _____ Memorize anything? _____ Look up information? _____ Ask someone for information? _____ Practice anything? _____ Explain what you learned to someone else? Was it: _____ Hard to learn? _____ Not so hard to learn? _____ Easy to learn? Were you: _____ Fascinated? _____ Fearful? _____ Fine? Initially, you probably had to exert a lot of effort and con- centration. People who are learning a new dance step, for ex- ample, find that it takes a great deal of concentration at the beginning. As you mastered the topic of interest, you likely required less conscious effort. Notice in Figure 4-1 how the PET scan demonstrates a decrease in the energy required to perform the task as the subject became more expert and Develop a Brawny Brain • 81"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"comfortable with the technique. The subject’s brain became more efficient — the same as your brain becomes more effi- cient as you become more expert. As you became more interested in the subject, did you talk to other people about your newest interest and get their input? Perhaps you searched out information to make you more knowledgeable in the same topic or a related one. The benefits are quite broad. By talking to others, you exercise other areas of your brain, such as the intrapersonal or lin- guistic area. You also might have branched into other areas, such as the right hemisphere for a touch of imagination to become more innovative, or perhaps tapped into your spa- tial abilities. In this section of the book, we are going to present vari- ous strategies to process information and learn something new. Be aware that by practicing these techniques in a learn- ing situation, you are exercising many regions of the brain. You might feel rusty in the beginning, but remember that as you practice, the activity shifts into other areas of the brain, and you become more efficient as you become more prac- ticed and relaxed. You wouldn’t want to exercise only one area of your body, so be sure that you practice all the follow- ing techniques in various types of learning situations and ex- ercise all of your brain. Also be sure to discuss and practice these techniques with your friends and family and exercise those linguistic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal skills. INFORMATION PROCESSING Information processing describes an active method for learn- ing something new. It is very easy to allow new information to pass us by. It takes a dynamic analysis of the information to make sense of it — to move it from short-term to long-term memory. You must make the new information meaningful for your brain so that the ideas will become important enough to make their way to long-term memory. In this chapter, you will learn how to work with information so that you can better remember it. 82 • Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"When we were young, we preferred to use one hand more often than the other. Over time, we became skilled with that hand and rarely used the other hand except for balance or coordination with our dominant hand. We can perform gross motor skills with the other hand, such as opening a door or petting an animal. Without thinking about it, we simply use our dominant hand. Some people who have lost function in their dominant hand find that, with practice, they can become facile with their less-dominant hand. Their handwriting may never be as clear with the new hand, but it can be understood. So it is with our preferred learning styles. Early on, we all found the best way for us to learn and, without thinking about it, applied that style to every situation. In Chapter 1, you learned what your dominant learning preference is, while in Chapter 2, you evaluated your natural intelligences. In this chapter you will explore supplementary ways to learn and how to develop your less-dominant learning styles and increase your use of the other intelligences.

DISTRACTIONS AND ATTENTION It is vitally important to the learning process that we pay at- tention and do not allow ourselves to be distracted from the information we are trying to process. We are trying to get this information from short-term memory (STM) to long-term mem- ory (LTM), and this requires the brain to restructure. (See Chapter 2 for details.) Let’s take, for example, the seemingly simple but amaz- ingly complex task of learning another person’s name as we are introduced. Many people are quite eager (and seemingly proud) to announce that they cannot remember people’s names even if they have just been introduced. They can ac- knowledge that an introduction has taken place, but they have no recollection of the name of the person. Often, the problem is easy to diagnose. At the instant of an introduc- tion, the person’s name is in the sensory store. We should be making efforts to pass the person’s name to STM and on to LTM. And indeed we are concentrating, but not necessarily Develop a Brawny Brain • 85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"on the name. Pressures in our culture divert our attention from the person we are meeting. This distraction may arise from our need to present ourselves well and make a good impression during the introduction. We also may be trying to be polite and pay attention to what the other person is saying. The little niceties and good manners are taking our attention away from the information we want to save. Whatever the reason, many people do not move the new person’s name from the sensory store to LTM simply be- cause they have not paid enough attention to exactly what they want to transfer. This is one example of intense con- centration used incorrectly. There are strategies to help you pay more attention at the moment of the introduction. You might use your preferred learning style to help learn the name. If you are a visual learner, you might want to visualize the name on a theater marquee. Asking a woman about the spelling of her name gives more attention to the name. For example, there are a va- 86 • Chapter 4 Tillie finally retired from the orange juice factory. She just couldn’t concentrate."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"riety of ways to spell Kathy: Cathy, Kathi, Cathie, and others. An auditory learner might want to repeat the person’s name aloud or find a rhyme to the name. One of our friends uses pretzel to remind him of Wetzel. Linking the name to a physi- cal object helps kinesthetic learners. A name such as Harmeyer contains an arm and an eye. Looking for these 3D representa- tions of a name helps a kinesthetic learner pay attention. Once you have your attention focused on a person, it may help to create a mental picture of the person. Associat- ing her name with another person or group will help. For example, if her name is common, link it to people with the same or similar names whom you already know. Using the person’s name as soon as possible and often during the first conversation will help you store the name. However, too much of a good thing might annoy your new acquaintance. So go easy! If you realize that you are easily distracted, and you know the introduction is coming, you can start noticing characteristics of the person as you walk over. Practice the name and the mechanisms you are going to use to remem- ber the name after the conversation is over and you are moving away from each other. In other words, you select as much as possible the time you are concentrating in order to avoid as many distractions as possible. You also might tell people at the end of the conversation that you are learning to remember names and give your own name again. People usually are relieved and repeat their own name as you say your good-byes. You can practice as you leave and are less distracted by the conversation. You may not feel that introductions are the most impor- tant concern in your life. And indeed, they may not be unless you are very active socially or introductions are a business concern. But regardless of the learning situation, you need to be in control as much as possible in order to limit the number of distractions as you try to process information. Remember the discussion in Chapter 3 regarding the environment and distractions? Be sure you are truly focusing on the material you want to transfer to LTM.

Re- constructing the scene where you learned her name may help jog your memory. Look carefully at her face in case you associated a feature with her name. Try not to get upset. Some enzymes block your synaptic activity under stress. Give yourself enough time to recall her name. Don’t set the goal that you must say “Hell o...“ using her name. If you relax, the name may come to you during the conversation, and you can use it then. You can use these techniques for introductions in many other situations. Try to implement a few of these recom- mendations to help you concentrate. In the meantime, we have a few exercises for you to try. Visual Concentration To improve your visual concentration, look at a scene in a room, outside, or in a magazine. Look for about 30 seconds, concentrating on what you see. At the end of the 30 seconds, turn away or close your eyes and try to remember every- thing you saw in the scene. Repeat this exercise with another scene. Practice this often. It’s a good game to play while waiting for someone. Notice how your ability to recall more items in the scene improves as you play more often. Auditory Concentration This is a game two or more people can play to develop their auditory concentration skills. It’s called “I’m shopping!” To play, choose someone to go first. The first person says “I’m shopping fo r...“ and names an object. The next person re- peats what the first person says and adds a product. Keep playing while people can keep up with the complete list, and restart the game when someone forgets a product. Re- member to have fun with this game.

If they are not the same numbers, remember what the numbers are, and turn them face down again. Continue until you have removed all pairs from the game. This game also can be played by two or more players. When one player fails to produce a pair, the next player takes over. As your concentration improves, add the rest of the deck to the game and draw four cards at a time.

INFORMATION-STORING PREFERENCES Many people have developed clever strategies to help them learn new information. The following sections are structured so that you can discover new strategies. You may recognize some of them as ones you use already. In each of the sections, you will be told what skill you are exercising and how the ac- tivity will improve your ability to process information. Researchers found that when the presentation of infor- mation and testing format match, performance increases. This means that if you are going to have to write something, practice writing; if you are going to have to say it, practice talking; if you are going to have to do something, practice doing it. Rehearsal The information-storing technique of rehearsal borrows its name from the theater. Actors and actresses use the repeti- tion of material when learning their lines, aloud or silently, until they commit those lines to memory. Some people copy and then recopy the lines. The entire cast rehearses the play often so that everyone will remember what to do when they are performing the show. You may have used rehearsal to remember a phone num- ber by repeating it from the time you looked it up in the tele- phone book until you dialed it. This moved it from your sensory store — reading it in the phone book — to your short- term memory. The memory persisted long enough to let you dial the number. However, because it had no special meaning attached to it, the phone number didn’t make it to long-term memory (LTM) . If the phone number is an important number (your mother’s new telephone number, for example), you may want to take steps to promote its move to LTM.

Saying the number aloud repeat- edly may help (auditory learning style). Writing the number repeatedly or dialing the number repeatedly also may help (kinesthetic learning style). You may discover that you use re- hearsal techniques quite often. Some examples include direc- tions to someone’s home or business, items to purchase at the store, or errands to run. Repetition Priming Repetition priming is a technical phrase for what you have ex- perienced if you can sing the jingle “See the USA in your Chevrolet!” or if you remember that Nancy Reagan wanted us to “Just Say No!” Repetition priming goes along with re- hearsal because the repeated hearing or seeing of informa- tion increases your recall of that information. The repetition, however, may not be conscious. You may be unaware of the Develop a Brawny Brain • 91 “To be at the doctor’s appointment at 10:30 A . M . or not to be at the dinner party at 6:00 P .

You may need a map or a set of directions to visit a friend’s home for the first time. After a few visits, however, you can find the way without the map or directions. You may not have made a conscious determi- nation to learn the way to her home, but the repetition helped you learn the way. A research study was performed in which tapes of word associations were played to patients who were anesthetized for surgery (with their prior consent). Testing later demon- strated that the patients had subliminally heard the tapes. 1 This test also demonstrates the importance of talking to patients who are unconscious, especially in an uplifting, en- couraging manner. It also may explain why associating with someone who constantly belittles you can seep into your subconscious and then into your conscious mind, affecting your attitude toward yourself. If you are trying to learn a new language, it helps to play tapes of people speaking the language. You can turn this technique to your advantage. 92 • Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Repetition Priming ADvantage This game emphasizes the power of repetition priming.

Once you’ve “got it,” the information, however valuable, is there for a very long time without a conscious effort at memo- rization on your part. Imaging If you are a visual learner, you probably create visual images automatically to help you remember information. The image may contain words or objects, but you can see the information in your mind. If your dominant learning style is not visual, you can learn to create these images. Practice on a grocery list. Try to learn the items on that list. Imagine yourself in the food store, walking down the aisles to locate the items. See your- self picking up an item and putting it into the grocery cart. Repeat this for each of the items. When you get to the store, you may use visual images to “see” your kitchen and remember what you need to buy. Buying clothes for someone else, you use your visual/spa- tial abilities to imagine the person, his size, and how the shirt you are holding will fit and look on him. Looking at the plans for a new house or the pattern for a new dress also re- quires exercising your spatial capabilities. For some people, distractions inhibit their ability to cre- ate images.

Coding Coding is the creation of a mnemonic or catch phrase that as- sociates material with something that is already familiar. The more complex the material, the more likely coding or imagery should be used as a memory technique. Some people find success associating a list of items with a mnemonic device. In grade school, for example, we learned that the first letters of the Great Lakes could be rearranged to spell the word HOMES (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior). To remember the names, we just needed to re- member HOMES. When we need to remember the names of the lakes, we also remember the mnemonic. We then can use it to reconstruct the original list. A link to a song or poem also is helpful. You may have learned the alphabet to the strains of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star and the number of days in each month with the poem 30 Days Hath September. Rosemary Austin, an intellectually active senior, remembers her license plate, 642 BBW, with the device that the numbers are reverse counting by twos and the letters represent Better Be Wary. Connections that you make will be stored in your mem- ory along with the ideas you are trying to remember. The more connections we have to a fact, the easier it is to retrieve it later . The curious thing about making associations with mnemonics is that the time and mental energy we put into developing them generally is enough prestorage processing that we tend to remember the original ideas. This extra con- centration alerts the brain that this information is important, and with that added meaning, the memory is more likely to be stored permanently.

There is efficiency in hierarchies that help us make connections. Consider the feline family in Figure 4-4. There are similarities among the members of that group of animals. What we know about a lion, for example, tells us many things about a domestic pet: its coat is fur, its face has whiskers, its movement is sleek and silent, and more. By connecting a person or object with a group, we do not have to make a long list of details about the new object. We allow the object to inherit the qualities of the group, which we al- ready have stored in our memories. Many groups have an inherent ranking system. The Armed Forces, for example, are organized into a very struc- tured ranking system where varying layers of officers take or- ders from and give orders to other soldiers in other strata in the ranks. In the Army, the generals are at the top. The suc- ceeding ranks of commissioned officers include Colonel, Ma- jor, Captain, and Lieutenant. The higher the rank, the more privileges and the more responsibility the officer bears. There are common features to all of the ranks. Rank Has Its Privilege This exercise provides practice in your new skill of noting rank within a hierarchy.

Group the items in an upper level of a hi- erarchy. After you decide on a proper hierarchy for these foods, cover up this page and write the items in a list in the or- der you determined. Solution: You could put them in a number of hierarchies. 1. You might use the groups formed by the Food Guide Pyramid in Figure 4-5. Sugar belongs at the top in the use sparingly category. Next, group the eggs and milk in the meat and dairy group. The third level is fruits and vegetables. Put broccoli, oranges, and lettuce in that group. The bottom of the pyramid is for breads. So, you need sugar, two meat and dairy, three fruit and vegeta- bles, and one bread. 2. You might employ the hierarchy based on the layout of your grocery store. Group the items by the aisle in which they are stacked: milk and eggs at the dairy counter; let- tuce, broccoli, and oranges in the produce aisle; bread in the bakery; and sugar in the seasoning aisle. So, you need two dairy, three produce, one bakery, and one seasoning. 100 • Chapter 4 The Food Guide Pyramid A guide to daily food choices Fats, oils, & sweets Use sparingly.

This helps to make a long list shorter, thereby reducing the num- ber of items you need to remember. Chunking helps you re- member telephone numbers. Each 10-digit telephone number is divided into three parts: the three-digit area code, the three- digit exchange office, and the four-digit line number. To re- member a 10-digit telephone number, try chunking the area code and the exchange. Then you only have to remember the four-digit line number. For example, you can reduce the num- ber 410 — 727 — 9416 to six items by remembering that 410 is a Maryland area code and 727 is a downtown Baltimore ex- change. Recall only MD, Baltimore, 9416 — six items! Now this won’t help much in you live in an area other than Baltimore and don’t know the area code and common exchanges to help you. You will have to personalize these examples in the book to match your situations. Here is another example of chunking. For a Los Angeles phone number, you can chunk one of the area codes, 714, into Joe Friday’s badge number from the detective show Dragnet. You also may chunk patterns in a telephone number.

Now that you have strategies to get the information into your brain, you need to develop a few strategies for getting the information back out in a timely manner. At one time or another, you probably tried to reach a des- tination and encountered a roadblock. The availability of an- other route was critical to getting there. So it is with learning. Your brain stores information in distinct neural pathways. The more connections you make at the moments of learning, the more pathways are available to recover the fact when you need it. There are several techniques for doing so. In geography class, you learned the names of the conti- nents. You may have learned them in a pattern. You may have linked them by size. You may have linked them by hemi- spheres or by bodies of water. You may have memorized their positions on a globe. When asked to recite the list, you recalled them in the manner you stored them and listed their names. Suppose that you are asked to list them in order of the number of letters in their names. Surely there is no connection in your brain for that order! You will need to use one of your other connections to recall all seven names and then process the list in a separate mental activity to arrive at the answer. One of the best ways to create and fine-tune connections is to teach something to someone else. There is an old say- ing : You never really understand something until you teach it. You might want to consider using your skills and knowl- edge to help others learn. You get the benefits of reactivating the connections you made when you learned the material and the benefits of the new learner’s view of the material. A prime example of passing along information strategies is Antonio Salazar. Search Strategies When a prompt for information and the connection to that information are present simultaneously, we call the phe- nomenon instant recall. The memory is triggered by the stim- ulation of the connection. Suppose that you need to recall 104 • Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"some information and it is not available instantly. Some- times you try to remember something and can’t. It’s right on the tip of your tongue. You know you should be able to re- member it, but you simply can’t find the fact. You can use some retrieval strategies to locate a connection that does trigger the memory. Looking for the information you need is a skill you can master. The following is a list of search strategies you can use to trigger that memory. Alphabetic search Recite the alphabet slowly. Perhaps the connection you are looking for is the first let- ter of the word. Scenario search Visualize the scene, the peo- ple, and the location where you learned the information. Association search Try to see, hear, or touch something that you originally associated with the fact.

Event search What were you doing when you used the information? Visual search Try to see the paper on which the words were written. People search Recall the people with whom you used the information. What did they say or do or look like? Increased stimulus search Keep listening to the request or ask for more information. This one is hard to under- stand at first, but it is one of the most powerful. Let’s look at one example of how the increased stimulus search works. Consider this exchange: Jane: You remember Janet, don’t you? Annette: No. Jane: Sure you do. We met her while we were together. Annette: No, but keep talking to see if you can jog my memory. Jane: OK, we were at the Red Cross luncheon last month, and she sat across the table from us. She had on that red hat that we both liked so much. Annette: That’s it! I remember the hat. Now I remem- ber who Janet is. She recently moved into that new condo in our neighborhood. In fact, I remember liking her very much.

By asking for more stimuli, you increase your prob- ability of finding a connection you can use. Follow-up: Practice each of these strategies the next time you are looking for that fact that is right on the tip of your tongue! Schemata In a letter to Robert Hooke, 3 Sir Isaac Newton wrote, “If I have seen further (than you and Descartes) it is by standing upon the shoulders of Giants.” Sir Isaac was referring to great scientists who had made so many contributions before him and from whom he had learned so very much that he did not have to rediscover their facts to advance science in the way that he did. This notion is the essence of schemata. New ideas rarely exist in a com- plete vacuum. They are related to other experiences, and we can borrow the knowledge from those experiences to learn new information. For example, think about filling your car with gasoline. You know the general plan for accomplishing that task. When you arrive at a new gas station, or when your regular station gets reconfigured with new pumps, you do not have to learn completely from the beginning how to pump the gas into your car. You know the general scheme of pumping gas. You need only to learn what is different from what you already know. Use schemas to help you retrieve memories by asking yourself, “How is the problem at hand similar to something I already know?” The strategies that use schemata include asking yourself two questions: 1. What is the same that I already know? 2. What is different from what I already know?"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"He said, she said.

A solution to the problem exists. 2. You can find the solution. If either of these beliefs is compromised, you stop look- ing for the solution. The key to retrieving information is to keep looking for it. Allow yourself plenty of time to remem- ber. Don’t get frustrated with yourself if you cannot remem- ber a fact in a split-second. The frustration will interfere with your search. Work through the search strategies you learned in this section. Associations The creation of associations refers to tying new information to already-learned information. Just as associations are formed by groups of people joined by a common interest, we can use common ideas to assist us in storing information in memory. You can make links or connections between what you want to learn and what you previously committed to memory. Thinking of one idea will cause you to think of the other. You can use this technique in all learning situations. The more as- sociations you create, the more likely you will be able to re- call the information successfully. This process is related to the expression Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you have used several techniques to try to retain some information, you are in effect carrying your information in more than one basket. And if something happens to one basket, you can still access the eggs (information) in the other baskets. One example is learning someone’s name. Suppose that you encounter a woman named Janet. You might try to find something distinctive about her that reminds you of a planet to help you remember by a rhyming link. Perhaps she has a round face.

Her strategies are much more robust than we implied and deserve a second look. She repeats to herself the thing she is trying to remember to do in an interesting rhyme or pattern (verbal rehearsal, repetition priming, and coding), writes it down on a piece of paper, and puts it next to her place mat where she will see it as she eats her meals (imagery, repetition prim- ing); then she tells her husband to remind her (repetition prim- ing). She knows her husband will never remind her, and he knows she doesn’t really expect him to remind her (so he doesn’t bother to store it). They are operating on an ac- cepted schema pattern here, where the circumstances of her telling him a fact are a memorable pattern. All the techniques 112 • Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"combined create many associations between the information she needs to learn and the information she already has stored in her mind.

You’ll find some possible answers for these associations at the end of this chapter in “Solutions to Exercises and Games.” 1. When you say salt, I say __________________________. 2. When you say husband, I say ______________________. 3. When you say Romeo, I say ________________________. 4. When you say Abbott, I say _______________________. 5.

In this exercise, you will practice looking for connections by mak- ing associations and chunking information. Noticing con- nections is a skill rather than a talent, and developing this skill requires practice. Fortunately, there is an easy, low-cost method for looking for connections.

PREPARING FOR YOUR INFORMATION- PROCESSING POSTASSESSMENT Before you do your postassessment, let’s see how you might apply some of the techniques of this chapter to the informa- tion-processing preassessment. First, refresh your mind by rereading the shopping scenario on page 83. Here are some examples of how you might have used the information-processing techniques of this chapter to help you remember the items on your errands list: Develop a Brawny Brain • 115"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"• Imaging: Look for the list in your memory. Visualize the place where you wrote the items on the list. You may be able to see the paper in your mind. If so, read it! • Coding: If you encode the list of the items before you leave the house, you might be able to recall the list. How about using your body as the code? Start at the top with your head. Your hair is on top — get your sister at the beauty shop. Next your mouth: You need to get a prescription as well as the groceries. Then your clothes, watch, and shoes are on your body. You need your hands to buy birthday cards. In your purse or pockets, you carry money, so go to the bank. Keep scanning over your body until you have accomplished all the tasks. • Mnemonics: Try to find a phrase to remind you of the stops: cleaners, shoe repair, druggist, watch repair, gro- cery, beauty shop, bank. You might want to rearrange the list to find a good mnemonic. We found this one: SGDBBCW — Some Great Danes bark, but collies wag. • Hierarchy: You will need a device for the list of items at the grocery store. Use the food pyramid to organize the foods you need: sweets at the top (ice cream), then meat and dairy (soup), next fruits and vegetables (bananas), and bottom grains (breads and rice). • Associations: There will be some help in the car with you. You will have the shirts and suit with you. That should remind you of the cleaners trip. Associate picking up with dropping off — that is, the shoes with the clothing. • Auditory learning-style preference: Read the items aloud before leaving the house. • Visual learning-style preference: Look over the list be- fore you leave the house. • Kinesthetic learning-style preference: See yourself at each of the stops before leaving the house. • Spatial: Plan your route before you leave the house. Plan to take the shortest route to all of the stops. Num- 116 • Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"ber the stops on the list in the order you will make them. This planning session alone will rehearse the list of errands in meaningful arrangements. Your brain will take notice that this is important information, and perhaps some of it will linger in short-term memory long enough for you to accomplish your tasks. Notice that we did not explicitly remember the list of items at the cleaners. They probably will not require a list. You most likely have the ticket for the cleaners, and if not, the cleaners has a record of what you dropped off. Spend your time and mental energy on the items for which you do not have a ready prompt. INFORMATION-PROCESSING POSTASSESSMENT Keep these various learning strategies in mind as you study the next few paragraphs. For example, make associations, develop mnemonics, look for hierarchies, and use repetition. You are going out to finish the last of your holiday shop- ping. You need to be sure that your uncle Lewis, your spouse’s cousin Edward, and niece Shara each have two gifts. The two gifts should total no more than $30. Lewis has just bought a new Chevy truck. Edward is environmentally conscious, and Shara is bubbly and energetic. You already have bought several gifts during off-season sales, with the intention of deciding who gets what later, and have them stored in your closet at home. The items and their values are Aluminum-can crusher $10 Interstate highway map $15 Recycling bins $20 You decide to give Edward the can crusher as well as the recycling bins and to give Lewis the map.

All the statements in the quiz you just took are false. They are all common misconceptions of the aging process. The changes in our physical and mental abilities pre- sented in this chapter are generalizations. The exact amount of the change is not the same for each individual. For exam- ple, you know individuals whose hearing has declined (some more than others) and other individuals whose hear- ing remains unchanged. So when you read research results or articles in newspapers that say “this” happens as we age, remember that “this” is not written in stone. “This” depends on individual characteristics, such as health and lifestyles and may be true for some and not for others. Speaking of research results, it is important to you as a consumer of information to understand the manner in which experimental results regarding the effects of aging are ob- tained. Many research projects are cross sectional in format. That means the comparisons are between, let’s say, a group of 126 • Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"20-year-olds and a different group of 70-year-olds. In some ways, this is like comparing apples to oranges. You don’t know what educational, economic, or environmental back- ground the participants experienced as they reached their present age. Their health and lifestyles may be quite diverse. The relevance of such tests sometimes is questionable when discussing the effects of age on cognitive and physical func- tions of individuals. However, a longitudinal study, in which specific individuals are tested as they progress in age, yields a true comparison of aging effects on an individual. Not as many longitudinal studies are performed as cross-sectional studies because of the expense and difficulties involved in tracking and evaluating people through many years. Another problem with many of the tests administered is the lack of connection of the tests to real life. Many tests are abstract in nature. Seeing how many numbers you can memorize, how quickly you can turn a lever, and so on are not relevant to a senior’s life. Some experts believe that the Support the Aging Brain • 127 Reprinted with permission."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"seniors do not compete or try as hard as the younger partic- ipants, who may have participated more recently in test sit- uations in school. Many studies concentrate on anticipated declines of abil- ities. Researchers feel the need to find declining abilities to try to prevent or minimize these declines. “Information about cognitive abilities that remain stable or increase with age, al- though perhaps desirable to provide a more balanced por- trayal of the true capabilities of older adults, has a lower priority among many researchers because it has been pre- sumed to be of less value in contributing to the ultimate elim- ination of age-related cognitive problems.” 1 Thus, many of the results of aging that have been pub- lished are disheartening, to say the least. However, retirement also would be distressing if we were not fully prepared with compensation strategies (part-time jobs and mortgage pre- payment to stretch our dollars) and accommodations (volun- teer work and travel to fill free time). So let’s take a hard look at aging’s effect on our bodies and minds. Then you can begin to prepare compensation and accommodation strategies to have enjoyable and successful senior years. Retirement is an accepted, normal part of aging, and if prepared for properly, a time of life we cheerfully anticipate. We prepare for retirement by evaluating present circum- stances and anticipating future changes in our economic sit- uation. Some individuals start earlier preparations, use better strategies, and thus are more prepared than others. Just as we want to be one of the more successful design- ers of our economic future, we want to be one of the more ef- fective analyzers of our physical and mental supply and demand. It is critical to our successful aging to be aware of potential changes in our bodies and mental supply and de- mand. You must prepare to maximize the good and mini- mize the bad effects of the aging process. “Old age is like everything else. To make a success of it you have to start young.” — Fred Astaire 128 • Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The younger you are when you begin to plan for aging, the healthier and more active you will be mentally and physically for more years. However, as the old saying goes, Better later than never. Don’t wait until tomorrow or next week to start. Determine today that you are going to take charge of how you age and not just accept whatever hap- pens to you. Only 35 percent of how you age is determined by genetics; the rest is determined by your lifestyle, envi- ronment, and other factors — many of which you can control and alter. PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF AGING As we age, our sensations and perceptions, our “bridges” to the world, may change and begin to decline. Some of our abil- ities to interact with and interpret the world correctly then may be dependent on our ability to perceive the world accu- rately and efficiently. As a matter of fact, some researchers believe that most of the declines traditionally attributed to senior’s cognitive abilities are actually the result of inaccura- cies in obtaining and processing information through our five senses. 2 The following discussion describes each of the five senses, our physical support structure, sleep requirements, and reaction times as they affect our mental abilities. Vision The single most important thing you can do for your eye- sight is to get an eye exam every one to two years. If you are a visual learner, sight is your primary mechanism for gath- ering information. Inaccuracies in judgments may be the re- sult of erroneously perceived information. It is imperative that you have regular eye exams. Not only do you need someone to prescribe the proper corrective lenses, but early detection of diseases such as glaucoma and macular degen- eration is essential to reduce damage. A profound loss of vision is not normal. Support the Aging Brain • 129"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The lens of the eye begins to stiffen in middle childhood, and we begin to focus less precisely. The decline is gradual and may not be noticed until the mid-thirties or mid-forties. For some people, this condition is corrected by glasses, contact lenses, or laser surgery. For declines in near- and far- sighted vision, glasses or contacts are compensation mecha- nisms. If you have progressed to bifocal prescriptions, you might consider monovision. This is a technique where a per- son wears two different lenses, one for nearsightedness and one for farsightedness. It takes most people approximately seven to 10 days to adjust, although a few people never ad- just. If an eye exam reveals that you need a simple pair of reading glasses, you can get them at a drugstore. Just be sure that you get a professional exam, instead of self-pre- scribing, so that you can be checked for conditions such as glaucoma. Other changes in vision can be attributed to diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, or macular degeneration. Regular eye examinations allow for early detection that can stop or slow disease progression. Glaucoma damages peripheral vision first and then moves on to destroy central vision. Glaucoma is the result of pressure on the optic nerve. Medicated eyedrops have been the most popular and prevalent treatment, but re- cently laser surgery has been successful as a treatment. Glau- coma sometimes is referred to as a silent blinder. By the time you realize that something is wrong, the disease has pro- gressed to an advanced stage. If you have a family history of glaucoma, are African-American, or are diabetic, your chances of developing glaucoma are higher than normal, and you should be especially conscientious about scheduling yearly eye exams. Macular degeneration affects the central part of the retina, which allows you to see details. Peripheral vision remains in- tact. Some of the symptoms are dark spots in the center of the vision area, blurring, and line distortion. Eye specialists often recommend special vitamins to combat this disease. Dark green leafy vegetables are high in carotenoids and reduce the risk of advanced macular degeneration by 43 percent. 3 130 • Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Remember that the best foods for us are the most brightly colored ones. Cataracts, another physical condition common to the aging of our eyes, are a clouding of the lens. In fact, some say that cataracts are inevitable, but we know some 90-year-olds who don’t appear to have cataracts. Of course, they may just be ag- ing at a different rate and they don’t show yet. The symptoms of a cataract are double vision in one eye, colors appear less bright, and decreased light sensitivity. The good news is that cataracts are corrected easily by surgery. It is also thought that reducing the eye’s exposure to ul- traviolet light reduces damage to the lens. You should wear sunglasses that are labeled indicating that they block 99 per- cent of both Ultraviolet A and Ultraviolet B light. Wearing a broad-brimmed hat while outdoors also reduces the amount of ultraviolet light to which the eye is exposed. One of the changes in our perceptions that research has identified is that our perceptual window narrows. We do not scan a large area as easily as when we were younger and need to break a large visual area into smaller sections to identify a target object. In other words, if we took our family for an outing and stood looking at a picturesque street scene, the younger members might take it all in at a glance. Older members of the family might subconsciously break the street into sections and look each one over for details. We need to focus on smaller sections of the environment. Upon occasion, I have “lost” my car in the parking lot. So, while I try to look like I know where I am going, I begin to scan the parking lot looking for my blue car among all the other cars. I don’t have to slow down the scanning process and check out the nonblue cars as I come across them. How- ever, the blue cars are all potentially mine, and I have to slow down and look more carefully to determine whether it is my blue car. To increase my speed and accuracy, I need to break the parking lot into sections and quickly scan one sec- tion at a time instead of looking repeatedly over the entire parking lot. Of course, if you have a general idea of where Support the Aging Brain • 131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"your car is located, you can just scan that one area. The sim- plest thing, I suppose, would be to tie something bright to the radio antenna and look for that. I think I’ll do that! We also become fractions of a second slower at identify- ing specific targets in a cluttered environment. A few hun- dredths of a second may not be important, or even noticeable to others, when looking for your car in a parking lot. Never- theless, this fraction-of-a-second delay could contribute to an accident if you are driving a car. If you are traveling in a car at 60 miles per hour (88 feet per second), a delay of just one- tenth second results in your car being almost nine feet farther along the road, possibly running into a stopped car in front of you. So get your eyes tested, take your vitamins, wear your glasses, and give yourself a little extra time to identify objects visually. Hearing A gradual loss of hearing sensitivity begins in young adult- hood. After age 50, approximately 70 percent of the popula- tion has some form of hearing loss. Hearing loss may affect all sound frequencies or just specific frequencies. I have a friend named Shelly, for example, who is legally deaf. Shelly can hear the pitch of my voice and yet cannot understand what someone with a deep, booming, very loud voice says. It’s not the loudness of the sound, it’s the pitch that affects her hear- ing. Not all adults suffer from loss of hearing. A profound loss of hearing is not normal. It may help to have a working definition for the degrees of hearing impairment as we continue our discussion about hearing. This table gives you a simple measurement scale of the degree of hearing loss you or someone you know may experience. 132 • Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"If you You may have Can hear a whisper at 20 feet No hearing loss Cannot hear a whisper at 3 feet Moderate hearing loss Cannot hear a conversational Severe hearing loss voice 1 foot away Cannot hear a shout with Profound hearing loss someone’s mouth next to your ear Men usually have more extensive and more rapid hear- ing loss than women. Women tend to retain their hearing ability. People who have had to work or live in areas that expose them to damaging noise levels experience a more significant loss of hearing as they age. City dwellers and in- dustrial workers experience greater hearing loss than those living in rural settings because of the constant exposure to background noise. This is the case with Kathleen’s father, Glenn Austin, whose office was located on the shop floor of an aircraft pro- duction plant with a constant high-level noise environment. Support the Aging Brain • 133 © Tribune Media Services, 1998. All Rights Reserved. Reprinted with permission."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"However, his problem is just the opposite of Shelly’s: it’s with high-frequency sounds. His daughters deliberately try to lower the pitch of their voices when they speak to him. Certain medications, such as those that reduce high blood pressure and inflammation, can decrease hearing ef- fectiveness in the high-frequency range. 4 You must have your hearing checked. Just because you hear some sound frequencies does not mean that you are hearing all sound frequencies at a safe level. This loss of hearing may have a great impact on social in- teraction. Asking people to repeat their conversations may cause older adults to become embarrassed, frustrated, and avoid interactions with others. You can use many strategies to accommodate this decline, however. An undesirable strat- egy is to pretend that you know what the person said. The consequences of this are not very appealing. Some people with hearing loss try to “listen in context.” This means that if they miss a word or two, they continue listening to deduce what the speaker may have said. At times this is a useful strategy, but the consequences might be dreadful if the de- duction is incorrect! For those who sustain gradual hearing loss, there is a natural tendency to make accommodations. This anecdote is an example of how one senior citizen made an accommoda- tion for his hearing loss. When someone spoke to him and he heard something, but not clearly and completely, he tried to determine from the portion he did hear and the circum- stances involved what must have been said. At first, he found this to be a dangerous practice. He may nod “yes” in the wrong places. Noting the reaction to your response be- comes very important. Soon he became very adept at ob- serving nonverbal reactions. It became automatic — like a minicomputer was doing it. After a while, he agreed that he needed a hearing aid. When he was being tested, an audiol- ogist assumed he must be lip reading, because he was re- sponding to questions so well without a hearing aid, despite 134 • Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"a significant hearing loss. When the elder said he didn’t know how to lip read, the audiologist blindfolded him to check this out. The elder still was able to respond appropri- ately. The audiologist concluded that the elder was “listen- ing in context” and not lip reading. This would seem to be a natural accommodation and probably not unique. More positive compensation strategies include the follow- ing actions. You can eliminate competing sounds such as the TV or radio by turning them off. If a speaker talks too quickly, you can ask him to slow down or speak more clearly. You also might be able to rearrange your sitting area so that you can sit across from your visitors and more clearly see their mouths and faces to help you interpret their speech. Try these adjust- ments to boost your ability to carry on a conversation better. Stay in the conversation longer for more enjoyment! When conversing with someone who may be using your nonverbal cues, give him time to do the processing.

Hearing degradation can be dangerous — we use our hear- ing to warn us of many dangers. Is the heater running con- stantly? Is someone breaking in? One of the simplest ways to minimize the effect of this decline is the use of a hearing aid. Amazingly, many people refuse to wear a hearing aid, even though the new hearing aids are very effective and fit into the ear canal so as to be in- visible. In one research study, of those individuals who found it difficult to follow a conversation in a crowded room, 75 percent did not use a hearing aid.

This affects our quality and enjoyment of life. Nothing tastes right any- more. We do not enjoy eating and may decide it is not worth the trouble to cook or go out to eat. We may not get all the nu- trition we need to feed our muscles, organs, and brains. A profound loss of taste is not normal. You might want to consider this as an opportunity to be adventurous and try new foods. How about the foods you tried before and did not like? Your tastes have changed, so perhaps you should give foods you did not like a second chance. Try hot sauce, anchovies, new fruits, and new veg- etables. Use this opportunity to investigate new cooking styles. You might be careful when adding spices to your foods for company. They may find it a little strong! Smell olfactory — relating to the sense of smell In general, some mild decrease of olfactory sensitivity is common with increasing age. Olfactory sensory receptor cells decrease in number as you age. A decrease in smell may influence our sensitivity to taste (as in when you have a cold). The smell of foods actually starts the digestive process because it triggers the release of insulin. This, in turn, influ- ences our tastes, diet, and nutrition. In addition, a decrease in olfactory abilities could affect our safety if we cannot detect a gas leak or notice the smell of spoiled foods. Some dentures have an effect on your sense of smell. Those dentures with a full upper plate across the roof of the mouth interfere with the absorption of the aroma of foods. If you have a set of these dentures and you notice that food does not smell or taste as well as before, consult with your 138 • Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"dentist about the possibility of a different style with a partial upper plate. A profound loss of smell is not normal. Research at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Cen- ter’s Smell and Taste Center indicates that a profound loss of smell is not normal and should be reported to your physi- cian. Although many physicians do not ask about your sense of smell during an examination, a drastic loss of smell is one of the initial signs of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and others. 6 Keep in mind that if you have started a new med- ication, it might be the medication that suddenly has af- fected your sense of smell and taste. You might want to check with your physician and pharmacist about possible side effects of your medications. neurodegenerative — relating to the decline of the powers of the brain Touch Touch is a combination of sensitivities to pressure, pain, and heat/cold. Not a lot of information is available on the changes to these sensitivities as we age. There is evidence that our sensitivity to pressure decreases. Although studies have been performed to determine the effects of aging on our perception of pain, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact effect, because so much of our evaluation of the pain is psycholog- ical. It just seems that some of us tolerate pain better than others. There is no clear-cut understanding of the changes with respect to pain. As far as our sensitivity to temperature differences, you are well aware that your body adjusts to gradual changes in temperature. In the middle of winter, for example, 45-degree temperatures seem warm after weeks of temperatures in the 20s to 30s. In the summer, however, a 45- degree temperature would seem very cold after weeks of temperatures in the 80s.

Osteoporosis, which means porous bone, is a condition of the bone in which the integrity of the bone structure is reduced, and breaks and fractures are more likely to occur. Many peo- ple believe it is a matter of clumsiness or carelessness that causes the senior to fall and break a bone. Often the bone breaks first and then the senior falls. The truth is that often seniors break a bone and then fall. This is due to loss of calcium in the bone structure. Although osteoporosis often is thought of as a woman’s disease, half the patients being treated for osteoporosis are men. A sim- ple, noninvasive bone-density test can determine your bone mass. In July 1998 Medicare began to pay for the bone-den- sity test once each year. To combat osteoporosis, weight-bearing activities such as walking and dancing cause bone cells to react by producing more bone cells and building stronger bones. Calcium sup- plements also help to reduce the loss of calcium and keep the bones strong. New prescription medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as FOSAMAX, help prevent bone loss. In addition, estr ogen-replacement therapy for postmenopausal women (see Chapter 6 for more details) often is recommended to preserve bone tissue. Con- sult your physician concerning these and other therapies. Muscles and the elastic cushioning of the vertebrae stiffen without proper exercises. Because 62 percent of those over the age of 65 do not exercise at all, it is not surprising that many seniors complain of muscle aches, pains, and stiffness of the joints.

If you get up at the same time every day, you begin to experience an accumulating “sleep debt.” You feel more tired as the days go by. A decrease in overall sleep begins at age 30 for many men and 50 for many women. By the age of 65, most seniors rarely experience an unbroken night’s sleep. Research indicates that people between the ages of 73 and 92 have an average of 21 awakenings during a given night. Men experience these awakenings more often than women until about age 70, when both men and women ex- hibit the same patterns of wakefulness. 7 Remember that sleep is essential to long-term memory formation as well as an overall sense of well-being. You must have complete cy- cles of sleep. Often, forgetfulness may be due to a lack of sleep instead of a decline in cognitive abilities. Chapter 6 de- tails more information about the effects of sleep on learning. Lack of sleep affects your intelligence, memory, and ability to concentrate. There are many sleep strategies to help meet the daily de- mands on your memory. You may want to talk to your physi- cian about the use of a sleeping aid such as melatonin or sleeping pills. Please be aware that supplements such as mela- tonin are controversial, and you should check with your phy- sician before you begin to take over-the-counter remedies such as t hese. Exercising your body during the day not only strengthens you physically but also expends energy and makes you ready for sleep. You also might try relaxation exercises, yoga, or the good old glass of warm milk prior to retiring. Reaction and Retrieval Time Reaction time is the amount of time it takes for an individual to respond to a stimulus. Average reaction time increases with increasing age for seniors as a group.

Some researchers ar- gue that this is a sign of cognitive decline. Many researchers, however, believe that this longer search and retrieval time might be due to the fact that the older we get, the more in- formation we have stored, so it takes longer to search for the particular piece of information we need. After all, if you only have a few pieces of information in your “library” it doesn’t take long to search through them all, but if you have thousands of facts and memories at you fingertips, it may indeed take you longer to find the relevant information. Is- n’t it uplifting to be thought of as a well-stocked library? Adults also may be slower due to a lack of aerobic exer- cise. Aerobic exercises have been shown to improve indi- vidual reaction times. Because exercise increases blood flow to the brain, this suggests that longer reaction times may be caused by brain malnutrition. Physically active older people can have shorter reaction times than less-fit younger adults. So, with a little work and exercise, we have the potential to be better than we ever were! Motivation may be important to reaction time and accu- racy. Many older adults are just not interested in studies on speed. In one study, researchers shortened young and older adult reaction times and decreased the age difference in re- action time by making payment for participation partially contingent on speed of response. 8 In other words, make it relevant (or profitable), and older adults try harder and achieve more. Monetary reward is definitely a good incen- tive for trying harder. PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF AGING There are those of us who relish getting older. The richness of life after 40 is wonderful, and over 50 is unbeatable. There are so many advantages to age — general knowledge, wisdom, self- knowledge, accomplishments, friends — that they are not read- ily countable.

We don’t want you to worry about getting older. We want you to begin preparations for a superb aging process. An old theory referred to disengagement of the senior adult as a necessary stage of life as you approached your last years. Removal from strenuous activity and interactions pre- pared the older adult to “pass on” and leave family members and friends behind. This theory was popular until the mid–1960s. Research has since demonstrated that the dis- tancing of elders from others leads to physical and mental de- cline. Elders should not remove themselves from activities. They should recenter on what is important, stay engaged in interpersonal relationships, remain or become physically ac- tive, and maintain a stimulating mental environment. Those who are happy and content with their lives show less cognitive decline than those suffering from stress or discontent. Negative emotions, such as depression, anxiety, bitter- ness, and anger, cause mental abilities to decrease. Depres- sion affects your motivation to remember, ability to concentrate, and perception of circumstances; it also causes overreactions to slight lapses in memory. 9 Moving can cause feelings of loneliness, grief, and an inability to concentrate. The reduction in responsibility and social contact after re- tirement may initially create feelings of a lack of purpose, sadness, and a sense of loss.

We have trouble listening to two different things at once. If more than one person is trying to talk to us, we have trouble following either conversation. This may be due in part to a decrease in our hearing acuity. One of the conversationalists needs to wait. We also have greater difficulty dividing our attention be- tween two tasks. For example, we may experience greater difficulty trying to talk on the phone while hunting for an address in the phone book, or trying to talk to the cashier 146 • Chapter 5 Sally,...do you ever think about the hereafter?

A failure in the ability to switch at- tention is evidenced when we go into the bedroom to look for a book and then cannot remember why we went in there. This problem is fairly common throughout life, and occur- rences may increase as we age. Much of the cognitive loss that is commonly considered a part of the aging process is actually attributable to extrin- sic factors such as lack of practice, poor motivation, diet, health complications, and fatigue, and poor conditions of the testing, etc. The older we get, the more robust our store of information and knowledge becomes. We need to be more efficient at managing our mental resources. Actually, some researchers consider young people to be suffering from a handicap of inexperience and lack of wisdom for which they compensate with a speedy mind. 10 Although it is commonly believed that age brings a loss of brain cells, new evidence points to neurogenesis — the birth of new neurons. neurogenesis — the growth of new brain cells Although it is true that the idle mind slows more rapidly than the lively mind, keeping it active is not enough. If you work a crossword puzzle every day, for example, you are exercising those particular areas of the brain each day. Those connections are strengthened and maintained. However, you want to stimulate other areas of the brain as well. Do you remember Figure 4-1, which compares the brain activity while learning a new task with brain activity after the task is more commonplace? If not, go peek again for another re- hearsal. When stimulation is new and novel, other areas are incorporated into the thinking process. Your mind must be exposed to new experiences and stimuli to keep it agile. New stimuli cause new connections to be made, and blood flow to those areas increases within days. Nevertheless, as soon as the new activity becomes more or less routine, ac- tivity decreases.

Wisdom Wisdom is expert knowledge about the fundamental issues of life. Wisdom has experience as the basis of sound judg- ment. As we age, we acquire insights into life’s structure based on hindsight. Having solved many problems in our lives, we are good problem solvers. Seniors are more flexi- ble, more comfortable with the ambiguities of life, and more context sensitive when applying problem-solving strategies to real-life situations. When faced with real-life problems, older subjects score consistently higher than younger sub- jects, trained therapists, and professional counselors. 11 As another example, although seniors read more slowly than the younger subjects, it was found that the seniors gener- ated more ideas in general and more ideas central to the reading when asked to summarize.

RESEARCH RESULTS Longitudinal studies — observe the same group of subjects over a long period of time, such as decades Cross-sectional studies — observe subjects of all ranges of ages, lifestyles, etc. at one particular time Many longitudinal studies indicate that aging is not syn- onymous with the decline of mental abilities. Some tests indi- cate that older adults in their 70s take more time and are not as accurate as participants in their 20s or 30s. However, you must remember that these are generalities and hide the fact that the physical and mental abilities of individuals differ tremen- dously from person to person. Informally, you know this your- self — you have friends who are physically active, other friends who are very agile mentally, and some friends who are both. You can learn a great deal from both types of studies. Generalizations from the results of these studies often have been published indicating that the older we get, the slower and more forgetful we get. Nevertheless, within the studies are individual differences: • All people do not age physically and mentally at the same rate. • Not all people get more forgetful with age. • For individuals who are over the age of 50, some men- tal abilities remain constant, some decrease, and some increase. 154 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"• Older persons who keep active and stimulated may im- prove their scores on intelligence tests. • Some studies indicate that there may be no decline in cognitive abilities.

In another study, Douglas Powell tested the math and reading-comprehension skills of more than 1,500 persons. The subjects ranged in age from 25 to 92 years old. He found that 25 percent to 33 percent of subjects in their 80s performed as well as the younger par- ticipants. Moreover, even the lowest scorers exhibited only small declines that did not interfere with daily living. Powell coined the term optimal agers to describe a small fraction of those in their 80s and 90s who exhibited exceptional scores, placing them near the top of mental abilities for all ages. The MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging identified four traits common to those people who are most likely to remain mentally sharp and active.

When our body’s health is compro- mised, as when we have a cold, our cognitive functions and emotional well-being suffer. When we suffer an emotional upset, our judgments are not as clear as we would like, and sometimes our body rebels under the stress with gastroin- testinal flareups or other aches and pains. In addition, when our cognitive functioning is not up to par, we cannot control or respond correctly to the physical and emotional demands in our environment. One of the central controlling mechanisms in this dance of life is the natural rhythm of our bodies. It causes us to wake at approximately the same hour each morning, coordi- nates blood pressure and temperature cycles, and controls hundreds of activities within our bodies. These rhythms can be a tremendous influence on our emotional well-being, physical functioning, and cognitive abilities. How effective we are at improving our bodies and minds while fighting off diseases and age-related changes depends to various degrees on our health, age, genetics, gender, attitude, and natural rhythms. The body’s natural rhythms are classified as • Ultradian, which are shorter than 24-hour cycles, such as the rhythm of your heartbeat • Circadian, which are approximately 24-hour cycles, such as your sleep/wake pattern • Infradian, which are longer than circadian, as in a woman’s hormonal cycle • Seasonal, which cycle throughout the year, as in a man’s testosterone cycle The emphasis in this book is on circadian rhythms unless otherwise noted.

Located in the hypothalamus, a quarter — sized structure in the brain, the SCN is vital for the formation of long-term 158 • Chapter 6 Retina S upra C hiasmatic Nucleus Light Optic Nerve Pineal Gland Hypothalamus Signals to body Figure 6-1 Supra chiasmatic nucleus"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"memories. Light reaches the retina of the eye, travels via the optic nerve to the brain, and resets the SCN. The resulting change in the SCN produces cycles, affects the nervous system, and sends signals to the pineal gland, which in turn affects hormonal levels. Recent studies indi- cate that the SCN can be reset using exposure to light on other areas of the body, such as the back of the knees, where blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin. Your body temperature, blood pressure, hormonal lev- els, sleep/wake cycle, and many other functions are con- trolled by your particular circadian rhythm. Although your rhythms may be similar to someone else’s in many respects, they will not be an exact match. Scientists have performed experiments that demonstrate how much control the SCN has over a body. In animals, if the SCN of one animal is re- placed with the SCN from a second animal, the first animal will take on the biological rhythms of the second animal. We intentionally or unintentionally interfere with the functioning of our internal clocks in many ways. When Day- light Savings Time (DST) goes into effect in the spring, the clocks in your house may be easily reset, but the clocks in your body are a little more difficult to reset. For several Regain an Agile Brain • 159"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"days, you may have difficulty going to sleep and getting up at the proper time, because it is one full hour earlier than it had been. You may find yourself more irritable in the morn- ings. In fact, traffic accidents increase by 8 percent during the week following DST implementation. 1 Because exposure to sunlight is a mechanism you can use to reset your circadian rhythm, you might go outside each morning to help reset your internal clock. Neverthe- less, until your body adjusts, be careful and don’t schedule any important activities that require your peak mental con- centration early in the morning. Traveling across multiple time zones (especially moving toward the east) also disrupts our internal clocks. It can re- sult in irritability, gastrointestinal upset, drowsiness during the day, and restlessness at night. These symptoms of a disharmonious biological rhythm often are referred to as jet lag. Some hotels now offer special rooms with full-spectrum lights that you can use to reset your internal clock. Full-spectrum lighting — Standard incandescent bulbs do not produce the blue end of the color spectrum, and florescent bulbs often miss out on the red end. Full- spectrum light bulbs produce all the colors of the rainbow and generate light similar to natural sunlight. Glenn Austin uses a mental trick to minimize jet lag. Whenever he flies into another time zone, as soon as he gets on the plane, he adjusts his watch to the destination time. If he falls asleep on the plane, all the better — he wakes up in the new time. Rotating shift work also results in the same jet-lag type of symptoms as our bodies try to adjust to continually changing systems of work and rest. Your body has numerous internal rhythms synchronized within a daily pattern. Jet lag and ro- tating shift work can desynchronize your internal clocks. Sleep, blood pressure, body temperature, and other cyclic functions can become out of phase with each other. It takes several days for the body to readjust and reestablish your nat- 160 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"ural rhythms. Moreover, remember from Chapter 2 that we need proper sleep patterns to assist us with our memory for- mations and cognitive functions (more on that in just a bit). Your emotions can affect your body’s cycles. Blood pres- sure has its own circadian rhythm, decreasing while you sleep and rising when you awaken. Those people with higher levels of anger and hostility lose this natural lower- ing of blood pressure during the night hours. This elevated blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, organ dam- age, and stroke. Don’t go to bed upset. You can do a nice lit- tle exercise whenever you have difficulty sleeping because you are stressed or otherwise upset: 1. Lie calmly on the bed. 2. Begin at the top of your head. Concentrate to see whether you can contract your scalp. Tighten, hold for a second or two, and then release. 3. Move to the back of your head. Tighten, hold, and then release your scalp. 4. Move to your forehead. Tighten the skin, hold, and then release. 5. Move to your eyebrows. Tighten the brows, hold, and then release. 6. Move to your nose. Tighten the nose, hold, and then release. 7. Move to your ears. Tighten the ears, hold, and then re- lease. 8. Move to your lips. Tighten the lips, hold, and then re- lease. 9. Continue the process down to your toes, taking small steps along the way. Include each finger as a step, each muscle in your arms, one arm at a time, one muscle at a time. (Author’s note: I have never been able to do this with my toes. I have always fallen asleep before then. It’s a very re- laxing exercise my father taught me!)

But this is the time when the level of many medicines taken to reduce the risk of heart attack is at its lowest. Other diseases, such as arthritis and even the common cold, have general times of the day when sufferers expect symptoms to be at their max- imum levels. Medicines to counteract these diseases should be matched to biological rhythms. Proper timing of medica- tions increases effectiveness, decreases side effects, allows you to manage your condition better, and may allow you to take smaller doses. Later, we have a section devoted to your medications and the effects they can have on your cognitive abilities. Perhaps if you can reduce the dosage using more efficient administration techniques, you can minimize the effects on your mental processes. Do not attempt to reduce the dosage of prescription medicines, however, without con- sulting with your physician first. As an example, compare the general pain cycles of osteo- arthritis, the most common form of arthritis, and rheuma- toid arthritis. Those suffering from osteoarthritis and those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis often take the same non- steroidal anti-inflammatory remedy, such as Ibuprofen, to alleviate their pain. Those with osteoarthritis tend to have more pain in the evening than in the morning and should take the pain reliever around noon or midafternoon. Those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, in which pain is higher in the morning, should take the pain reliever in the evening. Please keep in mind that these are only suggestions. If your doctor has told you to take the pain reliever at your conve- nience, then you might want to consider altering the time of day when you take it. However, if your doctor has told you a specific time to take your medicine, you must ask your doctor before you change your schedule. Researchers already are investigating this concept of matching the timing of medication administration to the symptom cycle and call it chronotherapy. They predict that pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and patients will soon become familiar with this term. Medicines will need to be 162 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"redesigned and prescribed differently. The body does not need a constant level of medicine in the blood throughout the day. It needs larger doses at specific times to support the body’s fight against symptom changes during the day. Already, many cancer centers are timing treatments to match the circadian rhythm of the patient with excellent success rates. Although not every researcher agrees, some research re- sults indicate that surgeries also can be more successful if scheduled according to a person’s biological rhythms. Death after surgery is three times as likely at midnight as at noon. A 20-year study of 1,200 premenopausal women found that 76 percent of those women who had surgery for breast can- cer in the week after ovulation, and only 63 percent of those Regain an Agile Brain • 163 “OK, Claire. If you were saving your brain for something big, this is it.”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"women who had the surgery earlier in the menstrual cycle, were cancer free after five years. 2 Just to reemphasize, be sure to ask your doctor about the best times to take your medication. Do not attempt to change the timing or dose of your medicines without the prior approval of your physician. In addition, when a doctor asks you whether your condition is worse in the morning, the doctor is probably asking you about when you wake up. If you are doing shift work and waking up in the evening, alert the doctor to this situation before answering that ques- tion. And for all you people out there who have experienced major difficulties with medical insurance claims, think of it as an excellent learning experience exercising those inter- personal, intrapersonal, linguistic, mathematical, and logi- cal intelligences. This information about your body’s natural rhythms is important to both your physical and mental abilities. You need to be aware of the effects of your natural rhythms on your body in order to minimize stress, perhaps decrease the amount of medicine you take, increase your resistance to dis- ease, and help regulate your sleep. All these factors are dis- cussed in greater detail throughout the rest of this chapter. RESTING YOUR BRAIN Before you read the information regarding sleep, answer the following questions about your current sleep patterns: 1. How many hours a night, on average, do you sleep? __________ 2. How many hours a night, on average, do you lie awake in bed? __________ 3. When you wake in the mornings, do you feel refreshed and ready to get started on a new day? __________ 4. If you take a nap or naps during the day, how many hours, on average, do you sleep? __________ 164 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"5. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being excellent and 5 being ex- tremely poor, how would you rate your sleep habits? __________ Sleep deprivation results in fatigue (no surprise there), irritability, decreased attention span, slower response time, memory gaps, and impaired judgment. Sleep is essential to maintain memory functions. There are two primary types of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, during which you dream, and non-REM, or slow-wave sleep. The sleep cycle can be divided into stages that you cycle through approxi- mately every 90 minutes (an ultradian rhythm). Non-REM sleep accounts for 75 percent of your sleep and has four stages. As you progress through the stages, sleep becomes deeper and brain waves become larger. After you reach the deepest level of sleep in stage four, sleep begins to lighten until you reach REM sleep. It appears that different types of learning may be facilitated within the different types of sleep, (See Figure 6-2). During REM sleep, activity in the brain begins in the pons and other midbrain areas. The pons communicates with the cerebral cortex and the thalamus. The pons also “turns off” motor neurons in the spinal cord, preventing movement. REM sleep is important to procedural memory formation of tasks such as typing and playing the piano. People who learned a repetitive task were found to be more efficient at the task after sleeping and experiencing REM sleep. In one study, subjects were trained on a task in the evening. During the night, some of the subjects were awakened each time they entered REM sleep, and the rest were awakened each time they entered non-REM sleep. Those who were awak- ened during REM sleep were just as efficient as they were the evening before. However, those who were awakened during non-REM sleep demonstrated significant improvement in performance over the performance levels of the evening be- fore. 3 Another type of memory, called declarative, in which Regain an Agile Brain • 165"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"memories are formed for events such as the vacation you took, people you visited, and conversations you had, also re- quires REM sleep for consolidation of information. Recall from earlier chapters that REM sleep makes it pos- sible to transfer new learning to long-term memory. REM sleep occurs earlier and lasts longer for individuals who have participated in intense learning experiences. REM sleep is a required part of the learning process during which the brain’s memories are replayed and compacted to con- serve space. This allows the brain to conserve space more ef- ficiently. As a point of interest, animals that do not possess the capability for REM sleep, like dolphins, have dispropor- tionately larger brains. The hippocampus also becomes involved as potential memories encountered during the day and determined to be important enough to store are transferred to long-term 166 • Chapter 6 Cerebral cortex Thalamus Pons Awake Non REM REM Spinal cord Figure 6-2 Different types of sleep"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"memory. One research study used mice to explore the learn- ing process. When mice were introduced to a new environ- ment, the hippocampus’ nerve cells began firing. That night, while the mice were in non-REM sleep, the neurons in the hippocampus began to fire again in the same pattern expe- rienced earlier in the day, but in shorter, faster bursts. And like an echo from a canyon wall, the cortex responded with neurons firing in a responsive similar pattern. 4 In Chapter 4, you learned that patients under the influ- ence of anesthesia and exposed to word associations on a recording could recall a statistically significant number of the associations. Another study involved participants who learned a complex logic task while an auditory signal, a clicking noise, occurred in the background. During REM sleep after the learning experience, some members of the group were re-exposed to the clicking noise and some were not. Those exposed to the same auditory stimuli during REM sleep retained the information 23 percent better than the group that did not hear the clicking noise during REM sleep. Do you remember the theory of playing records while you sleep to learn a foreign language or other material? The pro- cessing of information continues while we are asleep. So, not only do we process events we have experienced throughout the day, but we can subconsciously add to these memories. Many health professionals recommend that loved ones talk to unconscious patients with words of encouragement and support to aid the healing process. And how many of us have soothed a fretful baby back to sleep before he fully wak- ens by whispering words of love and comfort? As we age, many people experience a disruption of nat- ural rhythms, especially sleep patterns. We also experience changes in our alertness rhythm, especially men. This could be related to the fact that men experience shorter REM cycles, wake up more frequently, and experience less slow-wave sleep. Women do not seem to suffer as much disruption as men. Another change in natural rhythms accounts for a shift in sleeping times. Elders tend to be more alert in the morning and become drowsier in the afternoon. 5 Regain an Agile Brain • 167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Insomnia is trouble falling or staying asleep and is con- sidered chronic when the symptoms last for more than three weeks. After even one night of interrupted sleep, people complain of irritability, shorter attention span, memory gaps, and impaired judgment. Insomnia can exacerbate these symptoms. More than 50 percent of chronic insomnia cases can be attributed to emotional stress such as depres- sion or anxiety. Typically, depression causes you to awaken early, whereas anxiety may prevent you from going to sleep. Pain, restlessness, or other symptoms of illnesses also can disrupt your sleeping patterns. Moreover, once your sleep is disrupted, learned insom- nia can keep you awake until the pattern is broken. My mother experienced learned insomnia after she moved to the country. The barking of her dog at foraging nocturnal animals would awaken her. She then would get out of bed to check on the dog, and since she was awake, she would treat herself to something sweet to eat. Before too long, she was waking up at about that hour of the night regardless of whether the dog was barking. Her body had “learned” to wake up at an inappropriate time. Irregular sleep patterns, such as staying up late and sleeping in on the weekends, also can disrupt your sleep patterns. In addition, some med- ications can work on the central nervous system and pre- vent restful sleep from occurring. Interestingly, more than 50 percent of those people 65 years old and older experience regular disruptions of sleep cycles. Many elders do not produce sufficient quantities of melatonin or do not have sufficient melatonin receptors in the brain. 6 This inhibits the ability to initiate and maintain sleep during the night. Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland in the brain in rhythmical cycles, with high produc- tion levels at night and minute quantities produced during the day. See Figure 6-3. Many seniors whose brains have ceased manufacturing adequate levels of melatonin can benefit from doses of mela- tonin approximately two hours before bedtime. Alzheimer’s patients, who also have reduced levels of melatonin, bene- 168 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"fit from melatonin supplements as well. If the trouble is going to sleep, but once you fall asleep you can stay asleep, some physicians recommend fast-release melatonin sup- plements. If you have trouble staying asleep, a controlled- release form of melatonin may help. It may take several days to a week before you see an improvement and begin to reinstate your natural cycle. 7 These supplements are somewhat controversial, and you should not take them without your physician’s approval because of possible drug interactions and questionable quality control of many over-the-counter supplements.

A survey of 1,400 retirees at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris discovered that half the individuals had breathing problems during sleep, such as snoring or sleep apnea. Approximately 44 percent of older adults also experience periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS). Symptoms are leg movements and kicks repeated every 20 to 40 seconds throughout the night. Each move- ment causes the person to arouse enough to prevent restful sleep. 8 When your internal clock goes off schedule, sleeping cycles suffer. Sleep is a critical ingredient in the learning process and in our ability to recall information later. “When apnea led to daytime sleepiness, researchers found, the per- son showed significant loss of short-term memory and alert- ness on psychological test, the kind of mental slippage that can lead to dementia.” Sonia Ancoli-Israel, Director of the Sleep Disorders Clinic at San Diego’s Veterans Administra- tion Hospital says, “If you treated sleep problems in people with mild dementia, I think there’s a chance their mental de- terioration would improve.” 9 If you suffer from insomnia, you might check with your physician and pharmacist about possible side effects of your medications that may interfere with your sleep cycle. Some drugs, such as some beta-blockers prescribed for hy- pertension, interfere with the production of melatonin in the brain. Others may interfere with its absorption. Perhaps you can have your doctor prescribe a different type of drug that will not interfere with your production or absorption of melatonin. Some people use alcohol as an aide to go to sleep. It does relax you initially, but several hours later, when the alcohol is depleted, it results in insomnia. You can use other tech- niques to induce relaxation and help you fall asleep. 170 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Not only do you need to get adequate sleep each night, you need to have a regular sleep schedule from day to day.

It extracts these biochemicals from the foods we eat. Various biochemicals are used to make you feel happy, an- gry, relaxed, stressed, energized, or calm. Certain neuro- transmitters, such as serotonin, assist with sleep regulation and anxiety reduction. Serotonin is manufactured from the amino acid tryptophan, which is found in protein-rich"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"foods. Let’s take a little time to discuss just a few of the neu- rotransmitters. Acetylcholine is one of the essential ingredients for memory formation and maintenance. Acetylcholine is made from the fat-like B vitamin choline, which is found in egg yolks and organ meats. Scientists do not fully understand the manufacturing process but do know that Alzheimer’s disease can be linked to the underproduction of acetyl- choline due to the destruction of the cholinergic neurons that make it. Very few studies have been done on the effects of choline, but the few that do exist indicate that choline supplementation does enhance memory and reduce fatigue. However, if you have an abundant supply of choline and do not use it, this is similar to having a full tank of gasoline and not driving your car. You must use your mind to make the choline work for you. Soldiers have been given tyrosine supplements and then exposed to environmental stresses such as high altitudes or prolonged cold. The typical responses to these conditions, headaches and memory lapses, are reduced. This study also indicates the importance of these biochemicals to the proper working mechanisms of the brain. Other neurotransmitters, collectively called catecholamines, control arousal and anxiety states and are major factors in the brain’s ability to handle stress. You may have heard of some of these: dopamine, epinephrine, and norepenephrine. Dopamine and norepenephrine are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Stress in your environment depletes your blood of tyrosine, which is an important player in the manufacture of neurotransmitters. Amino acids, which are found in pro- tein-rich foods and other dietary substances, are used by the body to create these neurotransmitters. Deficiencies of B vitamins result in profound deleterious effects on the brain, such as abnormal brain waves, impaired memory, higher levels of anxiety and confusion, irritability, and depression. Even marginal deficiency levels demonstrate these effects. Remember serotonin? Folic acid is required to maintain the proper levels of serotonin in your brain. If your Regain an Agile Brain • 175"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"thiamin (B1) supply is deficient, your brain’s ability to use glucose is reduced, and less energy is available for your brain to maintain mental activities. From these few examples, it is obvious that if deficits ex- ist because of aging or stress, supplementation improves cognitive functioning. However, there is no evidence that any positive results will come from supplements if normal amounts of the neurotransmitters already exist. And there is always the possibility that if you self-prescribe supple- ments, you could overdose, resulting in adverse, possibly dangerous, reactions.

Let’s use a little old-fashioned math (exercise those par- ticular brain cells!) and determine one of the factors of your physical health: a measurement called your Body Mass Index (BMI).

It tones the body and helps you maintain a proper weight. It also helps to prevent osteoporosis, takes years off your physical age, and can improve your memory and in- telligence performance. A study was performed with rats in which some were not allowed to exercise, some ran on a wheel (comparable to peo- ple on a treadmill), and some were taught to navigate an ob- stacle course. The rats that ran on the wheel grew more blood vessels to supply the brain, and the rats that ran the obstacle course showed increased growth in brain cells.

Participating in this type of activity increases heart and lung fitness, overall endurance, and flexibility — but not strength. It also increases the amount of oxygen de- livered to the brain. The National Institute of Aging conducted a study using 65- to 75-year-olds. After beginning aerobic workouts and maintaining them for approximately three months, a 25 per- cent improvement in decision-making tasks and responding to visual and auditory cues was demonstrated. In addition, engaging in regular, high levels of physical activity counteracts the natural breakdown of the circadian rhythm as we age. 12 Low or medium levels of activity are not sufficient to counteract the effect of aging on the rest- activity rhythm. To counteract the effects of age on your rest-activity rhythm, you need a higher level of activity. Perhaps you want to start a little slower than aerobics. Don’t think that just because you don’t feel comfortable with aerobics — yet — you can’t do anything at all. Numerous studies of men and women of all ages show that those who exercise live longer than those who are sedentary. One long walk each week can take one year off your biological age. A study of 40,000 women in Iowa revealed that just taking one long walk a week can reduce the rate of death by 12 percent, compared to all sedentary women. Jogging, swimming, and other more vigorous activities increase health and reduce the risk even more. 13 Resistance exercise, such as weight training, increases the size and strength of your muscles but does not improve endurance. Resistance training of 66-year-old men, training at 80 percent of maximum level for 12 weeks, increased strength approximately 5 percent each day. You don’t even have to be in good physical shape to start. A progressive resistance training program that lasted eight weeks and met three times each week was designed for institutionalized, invalid elders in their 90s. Weight lifting improved their muscle strength 175 percent, while the cross- sectional area of muscle increased 15 percent, and their walk- ing speed increased by 50 percent. Some even began to walk Regain an Agile Brain • 181"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"without using a cane! The increased muscle strength facili- tated moving from sitting to standing and climbing stairs. Also, incidences of falling when moving from a chair were reduced. After the initial training period, the elders retained the results of the training with only one lifting session a week. If weight lifting can so drastically improve the condi- tion of institutionalized adults in their nineties, imagine what it can do for you! Amazingly, in the age group of older seniors, only 5 per- cent of men and 1 percent of women participate in weight training. 14 Perhaps few people try weight lifting because they are not aware of the benefits and the ease of getting started. You do not have to go to a gym. 182 • Chapter 6 Photo courtesy of Henry Ortega Older and Wiser Virginia Chestnut has had an adventurous three years.

If you’re over 40, overweight, smoke, or have a medical condition, check with your doctor first. 2. Beginners start with every other day. Your body needs recovery days to rest and get stronger. 3.

When your workout gets to be 30 minutes long, exer- cise a little harder for a few minutes during each work- out. You’ll get more fit in the same amount of time! 5. Work out a little more often. After you’re comfortable exercising three times a week for 30 to 60 minutes each time, you could increase the number of days. Choose the same or a different activ- ity on alternate days. Follow “beginner’s” rules: Start gently, increase slowly. 6. Cross train. Develop more than one activity so you don’t over- use one set of muscles and cause pain or an injury, and so you don’t get bored. Learn a different activ- ity, or learn a sport for each season of the year. Ice skate in winter. Roller blade in summer. 7. Have a foul weather plan. Bad weather’s no excuse. Join a health club, walk at a shopping mall, buy a jump rope, get an exercise video from the library, or buy a piece of indoor equipment. 8. Buy good shoes. If you walk, run, do aerobics, or play racquet sports, good shoes keep you comfortable and prevent injuries. 9. Be sure your equipment fits. If you ride a bicycle, ski, or use indoor equipment, have a professional check the fit. You’ll be more comfortable and enjoy your activity more. 10. Listen to your body.

Your emotions are very influential in the quality of your mental and physical health and efficiency. Some emotional aspects of your personality — such as a car- ing or loving nature, a high level of self-esteem, and a feel- ing of being in control of your life (self-efficacy) — are beneficial. Other emotions — such as stress, depression, and loneliness — are detrimental to the quality of your life at any age. The following assessment may help you identify how you are dealing with the highs and lows of life. Mental-State Assessment Ask yourself the following questions. The key to this miniquiz is prolonged symptoms. When you answer “yes” to any of these, be certain that the situation is characteristic for you for a period of more than two weeks. 1. _____ Do you feel sad most of the time for long peri- ods of time? 2. _____ Are you irritable, and do you stay that way for more than two weeks? 3. _____ Has your weight increased or decreased with- out that being your intention?

Stress Although stress is not an inescapable result of aging, most in- dividuals suffer from some form of stress at various times of their lives. Losing a job; the loss of loved ones to death, di- vorce, or a debilitating illness; a decrease in safety and sup- port structures in neighborhoods; a lack of transportation;"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"and a loss of independence are all stressful situations. Even happy situations, such as the birth of a baby, buying a new home, or planning parties, can be stressful. Qualities that help people deal with stress in a positive manner are flexibility, adaptability, and a sense of humor. Also critical to the reduction of stress is a support system of people with whom you can share your distress. The ability to find meaning in stressful situations as well as just han- dling the problem are part of the wisdom we acquire as we age, and that experience helps us put stressful situations into perspective. 18 All these qualities and abilities reduce the negative effects of stress on our body, mind, and spirit. Neu- roscientists are “convinced that people who overreact to stress lead shorter lives and are more susceptible to acceler- ated brain and nervous system disease.” 19 “A man 90 years old was asked to what he attributed his longevity. ‘I reckon,’ he said, with a twinkle in his eye, ‘it’s because most nights I went to bed and slept when I should have sat up and worried.’” — Dorothea Kent Stress triggers the release of hydrocortisone, which can assist you in a “fight or flight” situation by sharpening your reflexes, raising your heart rate, and preparing you to de- fend your life. Short-term stresses such as traffic jams or dis- agreements with a spouse do not seem to have long-term effects. However, long-term stressful situations such as abuse or serving in wartime situations can create permanent effects that continue years later. Months and years of ele- vated hydrocortisone levels can cause the hippocampus to shrink. One estimate is a 25 percent loss in mass. As Robert Sapolsky said, “This is like reporting that an emotional trauma eliminates one of the four chambers of the heart.” 20 Remember that the hippocampus is essential to your abili- ties to concentrate, as well as to store and recall information. Many people who are stressed lose their appetite and lose weight or eat compulsively and gain weight; as a result, 190 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"they experience a decrease in lymphocytes (which fight off in- fection).

Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that is especially beneficial for helping you learn to relax. You can start at any age. Other negative emotions are anger, depression and loneliness. A study of 1,623 heart-attack victims, conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School, discovered that “angry episodes” doubled the risk of a heart attack. The heart attacks “often occurred a mere two hours after the outburst.” 21 Someone suffering from anger and hostility needs to learn some forms of stress management. Loneliness is inversely related to self-esteem. Feelings of loneliness are linked to depression, anxiety, and hostility, as well as suicide and vulnerability to health problems. Pa- tients who suffer from depression are four times more likely to die within six months of a heart attack and three times as likely to die within 10 years of a stroke. Some researchers are beginning to investigate whether treating psychological conditions can increase survival rates, and two studies show that participants in support groups have higher survival rates for various cancers. The Charles A. Dana Foundation has established the Brain-Body Connection to further re- search into the ramifications of this brain-body link. Dr. Schaie found that being married to a smart spouse is directly associated with maintaining our mental abilities and aging well. He found that the mental quickness of one spouse would entice the other spouse to become more effi- cient in order to “keep up.” Perhaps you are not married, but you may have a significant other or a close friend with whom you spend a great deal of time. You probably share some of the same interests and may have interests in differ- ent areas as well. Learn from each other. Be adventurous. Try new restaurants, take a class together, go to the movies and discuss the plot afterward over a cup of coffee. You will practice your verbal and logic skills as you converse. You will exercise “flabby” brain connections as you learn about new ideas and explore new opportunities. To combat loneliness and mild depression, get involved. Join a senior citizens center.

Reaching out to others and feeling needed is a vital part of our lives. We all want to know we have made a difference by being here on this planet. You are never too young or too old to care for others and make that difference. Those who love deeply never grow old; they may die of old age, but they die young. — Benjamin Franklin Spiritual A spiritual belief is linked to a higher satisfaction with life. Knowing that there is a higher plan for your life, whatever your official religion, helps you deal with stressful situations. Spirituality has been linked to successful aging. Adults who are active in religion tend to exhibit better physical and men- tal health than those adults who do not participate in religion as much. Religion often can provide a sense of community with other like believers who may offer the support of a fam- ily environment. Social gatherings are often a part of this sense of community and provide opportunities for you to in- teract and stay mentally active in a safe, caring environment. We believe that a sense of humor is a part of your inner spirit. Perhaps you have noticed humorous jokes and uplift- ing and jocular quotes throughout this book. Humor and a positive attitude are strongly associated with our feelings of being in control of our lives — whether or not we actually are. A good laugh also helps to keep us young in spirit and has been shown to be associated with aging well. Buy or check out joke books. Go out on the Internet and find joke sites.

The extent of damage inflicted on an individual de- pends on the severity and location of the stroke, as well as the speed with which you receive treatment. The term golden hour was coined by Dr. R. Adams Cowley of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services, who is regarded as the pioneer of modern trauma care. Medical intervention within the first hour after trauma is critical for increasing the patient’s chance of survival. This hour, called the golden hour, begins the moment the injury occurs. Very recent advances may have increased this window of opportunity to three hours. Nevertheless, if you think that you might be experi- encing a stroke, seek help immediately. Do not delay. It is better to be safe than sorry. The effects of a stroke can be min- imized with immediate attention. Remember the discussions in Chapter 2 of where the dif- ferent brain functions are located? The long-term potential for healing any damage caused by brain injury depends largely on your age. At birth, for example, both hemispheres seem to have potential for a language center. Based on ob- servations of severely epileptic infants whose hemispheres must be surgically severed, language still can be acquired and handled in the right hemisphere. If severe damage oc- curs to a mature brain, the right hemisphere may not be able to accommodate speech other than an odd word here or there. An intriguing example of the left/right hemispheres is the case of N.G., a homemaker whose corpus callosum had been severed so that no communication from one hemi- sphere to the other existed. Jean-Pierre Changeux describes an experiment in which objects were presented to N.G. on a split screen, so that what is presented in the left visual field is seen only by the left eye, and what is presented in the right visual field is seen by the right eye only. What the left eye sees is transmitted to the right hemisphere of the brain, and what the right eye sees is transmitted to the left hemi- sphere of the brain. N.G. is left-brain dominant, and there- fore her language and verbal capabilities are in the left hemisphere. Regain an Agile Brain • 195"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"When a cup was exhibited in the right visual field, the image was transmitted to N.G.’s left hemisphere and recog- nized. Because her verbal ability was in that side of the cor- tex, N.G. stated that she saw a cup. When a spoon was exhibited to her left eye, and the image was transmitted to the right hemisphere, N.G. could not verbalize the name “spoon.” Instead, she could choose a spoon from a number of available objects with her left hand. The right brain iden- tified the image to the left hand, but without the verbal abil- ities of the left hemisphere, N.G. could not name it. When shown a naked woman on the left side of the screen, N.G. blushed and laughed behind her hand. But when asked what she had seen, she said she had seen a flash of light. Again, she could not correctly verbalize her stimulus, but the right hemisphere recognized the image and reacted emotionally. An acquaintance, a male engineer, had a stroke in the corpus callosum. Thus, he had trouble passing information from one hemisphere to another, as did N.G. With his emo- tions on one side and his math and language skills on the other, he had no trouble counting to 100 but could not an- swer the question “How do you feel?” If you are dealing with the effects of a stroke, and one method does not produce improvement or recognition, keep trying other methods. If the person cannot talk, try writing. Perhaps they can sing, instead. Try presenting in- formation from the other side or to the other hand. Alzheimer’s Disease Interestingly (in a rather sad way), a research study reported that how we view forgetfulness depends on how old the person is that forgot the information. Both older and younger adults view forgetfulness in an older adult as a sign of senility. The same degree of forgetfulness in a younger person is considered just due to bad luck by both older and younger adult observers. A bumper sticker reads “You are never wrong until someone is listening.” Isn’t it a shame that we do not listen to how often we are correct and how 196 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"often we remember those important facts, dates, and er- rands? Instead, we amplify the times we are incorrect or cannot immediately recall a desired piece of information. Every time we forget something, it does not mean that we are entering the beginning stages of Alzheimer’s. Many of us joke about Alzheimer’s or senility when we cannot re- member something or cannot find the word we are trying to say. But these jokes hide our fears that we will be one of those members of the population who truly do suffer from senility and Alzheimer’s. There are many other reasons we may be forgetful. Increased stress can keep our minds occu- pied. Vitamin deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, simple disuse of brain cells, and other factors must be eliminated as legitimate causes of forgetfulness and memory impairment. After all other possible causes of memory reduction have been eliminated, then we need to consider Alzheimer’s dis- ease as a possibility. Many studies also indicate that mental “fuzziness” resulting from lack of sleep, poor nutrition, lack of exercise, or simple disuse of those neuronal connections can be misinterpreted as the beginnings of Alzheimer’s dis- ease. Don’t live in fear that the doctor may tell you some- thing you don’t want to hear. Your doctor may tell you that you suffer from a simple vitamin deficiency and that changes to your diet will take care of the problem. One other possibility for memory impairment in wo- men is a lack of estrogen. Women in their thirties who had certain diseases and were receiving estrogen-suppressing drugs exhibit verbal, but not visual or spatial, memory loss and reduced levels of concentration. Men also have estro- gen receptors in their brains. Researchers are beginning to examine the possibility that estrogen therapy may improve memory function in men as well. You need to weigh the risks against the benefits. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), although proven to be effective in reducing the symptoms of senility and Alzheimer’s disease in women, is not for everyone. Although ERT helps control osteo- porosis, improves memory, improves coordination, and protects against Alzheimer’s, it also is thought to increase Regain an Agile Brain • 197"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"the risk of endometrial and breast cancer. For women with a family history of breast cancer, ERT may not be an ap- propriate therapy. Consult your doctor. Notice the test scores for women diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease who were and were not using estrogen therapy. In all cases, the women using estrogen scored higher, especially on comprehension tests. Notice Figure 6-6, which demonstrates the results of es- trogen therapy on a group of retired women. This study demonstrates that those who took estrogen longer had a significantly lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen actually may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. Peo- ple who had taken these drugs for a minimum of two years had half the risk of Alzheimer’s disease as those who had not taken the drug. 22 198 • Chapter 6 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Visual Span Digital Span Verbal Recall Drawing Comprehension Verbal Fluency Naming Scores Test Category Using Estrogen No Estrogen Figure 6-5 Test Scores for Women Alzheimer’s Patients.

The effects of vitamin and herbal supplements some- times are controversial. It is possible to overdose and harm yourself. Recall from earlier discussions that you must check with your doctor first before you embark into new self-help territory, especially if you already are taking some medications. Some researchers believe that having a high degree of education and maintaining a high level of mental activity protect the brain against the ravaging effects of Alzheimer’s. Learning new things keeps the brain’s connections robust and flourishing. This gives you a greater supply of connec- tions to use as surplus in order to maintain your mental abil- ity if Alzheimer’s disease does affect you. Doctors and Medication We cannot begin to impress on you enough the importance of a yearly physical exam. As you can tell from the informa- tion we have presented regarding sleep, nutrition, exercise, psychological attitude, and spiritual values, your mental health and physical health are intimately intertwined. Sometimes what we think are irreparable consequences of aging can be corrected. If you notice changes, especially if they are sudden, in memory, energy levels, or even just a general feeling that all is not well, seek out your doctor. Have your doctor test you for inappropriate hormonal lev- els, vitamin deficiencies, high blood pressure, and so on. And if you check out fine and are physically able to start an exercise program, try various techniques described in the text to get those muscles moving and oxygen pumping. If your doctor cannot find anything wrong with you, but you still do not feel quite right, get a second or even third opinion. For example, Virginia Chestnut (whom you met earlier) suffered for many years from high blood pressure that was not adequately controlled by medications. She also felt “bone-tired” all the time and would fall asleep within 200 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"minutes of sitting down. Three doctors, including a geriatric specialist, did not find an underlying condition that might cause the symptoms and just prescribed more medication. After all, she thought, she wasn’t 29 anymore. Within 10 minutes of meeting her, a cardiologist using only a stetho- scope determined that both carotid arteries (which feed the brain) and the arteries to her kidneys (which elevated the blood pressure) probably were blocked. Further testing con- firmed his diagnosis. Surgeries to remove the blockages re- duced Virginia’s blood pressure and improved her memory, and she no longer falls asleep whenever she sits down. That was two years ago when she was 79. She is now 81, and a stronger, more vigorous woman you will never meet. We tell you this story to illustrate our assertion that you know your body. You’ve lived in it your whole life. If you don’t feel your doctor is meeting your needs, find another one. It only takes one right opinion to start you on the road to better health, happier spirits, and clearer thoughts. Now let’s address medications. Many medications slow the brain. Simple over-the-counter antihistamines come with the warning not to operate heavy machinery while tak- ing the medicine. That’s because it slows the speed of your mental processing and reaction time. Heavy machinery, by the way, includes your car and the riding lawn mower. Other medication, as previously mentioned, can disrupt your sleep patterns, dull the senses with which you input information, or affect your nutritional intake. Read the labels. Become a more careful consumer of your medications. Check with your pharmacist and doctor for side effects. Perhaps, if you feel like your brain is packed in cotton or are experiencing other side affects, you can switch medications. Another consideration is medicinal in- teractions. My husband, for example, who has had a severe heart attack, takes numerous medications. The doctor and pharmacist were keeping an eye on everything, and the pharmacist’s computer was programmed to flag for various interactions (including this particular one).

Take all of your medications to your doctor and to the pharmacist. Ask the pharmacist to check them all and deter- mine whether there are any potential adverse interactions. And when you are doing this, bring along your vitamins and supplements. CONCLUSION We hope that you have learned a few facts in this chapter that you did not know and found a few ideas to integrate into your lifestyle. Because rehearsals are one of the learning techniques you are incorporating and practicing, let’s take a minute to recap. Research has identified many factors associated with successful aging and maintenance of mental agility. Briefly discussing each one, let’s start with your general health. The absence of diseases and good overall health indicate that your body is performing at an adequate level and is able to provide the support (nutritional and physical) that your brain requires to operate efficiently. Another factor was high socioeconomic status. Having a little extra access to other members of society and having at least a little money for ex- tras allows you to indulge yourself in more educational ac- tivities and the stimulating environment that is conducive to mental animation. But if you do not have a lot of money, there are plenty of free opportunities for exercising those mental muscles. Visiting the library, having a friend over to your house, and going to rehearsals of plays and musical performances are all possibilities for exercising your mind. A stimulating environment keeps those neurons popping and creates new connections. Search out new interests and new opportunities. Many colleges will let seniors take classes at a reduced rate or will waive the fees entirely (see Appendix A). Next, having a flexible personality is an indi- 202 • Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"cation that you are willing to try new things. And last, but not least, keep in contact with your friends. Practice those mental skills. Have little contests to see who has the better memory. The loser has to practice harder the next week. SELF-QUIZ Here is a self-assessment on the six characteristics associated with successful aging and mental agility. For each one, list what you now are working on for developing these charac- teristics and then identify three things in each characteristic that you can start doing to regain your brain.

Recall Figure 4-1, where a PET scan demon- strated the different areas of the brain that are activated for a verbal skill when it is new and when it is practiced. You need to keep trying new things.

Also, remember (of course you do — you’ve been practicing) that in Chapter 2 we showed you the various areas of the brain. We discussed them in reference to Gardner’s multiple intelligences, which are linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, kines- thetic, naturalist, and personal. Like a body builder who wants the entire physique well developed and strong, you want all aspects of your mental abilities to be vigorous and well developed. Chapter 6 dealt with many of these intelli- gences in the context of possible alterations and improve- ments to your way of life. We have given you many suggestions on methods to im- prove the quality of your life throughout this text and dis- cussed why each one was important to both your overall health and your mental agility. These suggested strategies were based on well-grounded research by many individuals and groups. One of the researchers we mentioned was Dr. K. Warner Schaie. We are going to introduce you to some of his other results and especially those he obtained working with Dr. Sherry Willis, his wife. If you have been skimming over the technical sections of the book so far, we encourage you to read this section anyway. This is the basis of our reasons for writing this book. This is, shall we say, The Big Payoff. THE BIG PAYOFF K. Warner Schaie directs one of the most extensive longitu- dinal research programs on intellectual functions over the adult ages. The Seattle Longitudinal Study began in 1956. More than 5,000 participants ranging in age from 22 to 95 were interviewed and tested in seven-year cycles. Results indicated that participants gained in proficiency through their early forties and then functioned at approximately the same level throughout the rest of their forties through their late fifties or sixties. As Table 7-1 indicates, most participants actually maintained stable performances on most cognitive 208 • Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"abilities well into old age. As late as their sixties, most peo- ple do not show significant changes in mental abilities from the last testing. By their eighties, most people have experi- enced some decline in at least one area. Moreover, between the ages of 74 and 81, less than half showed mental declines on all of the mental activities tested. The other half showed declines in some but not all abilities, particularly those re- quiring psychomotor speed. Other studies, such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), confirm these results. The BLSA has followed Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility • 209 Word Fluency Number Inductive Reasoning to age 60 Spatial Orientation Verbal Meaning Percentage Maintaining Over Seven years 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 to age 74 to age 67 to age 81 Table 7-1 Proportion of Individuals Who Maintain Stable Levels of Performance Over Seven Years on Primary Abilities, Schaie, 1996."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"more than 2,000 participants since 1958. Results indicate that as we age past our sixties, our ability to remember figures and shapes may decrease, but our vocabulary increases into our eighties and then may decrease slightly. 1 This increase in our vocabulary skills is thought to be due to use and increased ex- posure throughout our life to words. As we age, however, many of us are not called on to practice and exercise skills such as spatial abilities, logic, and so on, and so it is thought that these skills decrease due to disuse. Dr. Willis and Dr. Schaie wanted to determine whether modest declines in specific mental processes could be re- versed in healthy individuals. This would lend greater cre- dence to the theory that mental declines in otherwise healthy individuals could be attributed to disuse. A Primary Mental Ability Test had been administered to the subjects participat- ing in the Seattle Longitudinal Study 14 years prior to this in- tervention strategy and was used as a benchmark. From this group, 229 subjects from 64 to 75 years old and in good health, who exhibited marked losses in mental functioning over the past 14 years, were selected to determine whether mental performances could be improved through tutoring and practice of skills. Dr. Schaie and Dr. Willis embarked on a training program to improve mental functioning in a set of the participants. These participants were given five one-hour sessions aimed at improving basic abilities such as inductive reasoning and spatial abilities and offered strategies for tack- ling tasks such as memorization. The seniors then were tested again. Their results were stunning. After merely five one-hour training sessions, 66 per- cent of the seniors improved dramatically and 40 per- cent regained up to 14 years in mental ability. Approximately 66 percent demonstrated significant im- provement. Some 40 percent regained everything they had lost over the years, scoring as well or better than they had 14 years earlier. Still more stunning is that this advance per- sisted for at least seven more years without further train- 210 • Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"ing.” 2 When checked on seven years later, they still demon- strated a distinct advantage compared to those who had not received the training. After seven years, without further training, these se- niors maintained this improvement. You may recall from earlier chapters that how much you, as an individual, decline is dependent on many things, such as genetics, disease, level of activity, and so on. Some of these factors, such as genetics, you obviously cannot change. K. Warner Schaie identified six of the factors associ- ated with retaining strong mental functions that you may be able to control: 1. Absence of cardiovascular and other diseases 2. High socioeconomic status 3. Involvement in complex and intellectually stimulating environment 4. Flexible personality at midlife 5. High cognitive status of spouse 6. Maintenance of high levels of perceptual processing speed In Chapter 6, we talked about how to control the first five factors in the list. We are going to discuss number 6 and readdress numbers 3 and 4 in this chapter within the context of training, exercising, and rejuvenating those brain cells. In this chapter, you will have an opportunity to take a preassessment test, experience a set of training exercises, and then retest to assess your gains. In general, to combat the effects of cognitive decline, you can 1. Accommodate: You alter the activities you used to per- form. You may start to write things down to help you re- member ideas that you are reading about. 2. Compensate: Use additional processes to supplement your abilities and maintain your usual activities. You Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility • 211"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"may use glasses to allow you to read as comfortably as before or select the large-print editions. 3. Remediate: Intervene by improving the affected ability. Investigate eye surgery to fix the problem once and for all. We have focused on compensation strategies and reme- diation strategies in this text. One of the methods you can use to compensate is external memory aids. One of the more interesting research studies involved the use of an ugly plate as a visual mnemonic device for seniors to use as a memory aid (see Figure 7-1). The plate was a cheap plastic three-sec- tion picnic plate in the ugliest color the researchers could find. The plate was placed in a prominent place in the home (where you couldn’t possibly miss it). It could only be re- moved for social occasions. Items to be remembered, such as 212 • Chapter 7 Figure 7-1 The Ugly Plate"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"glasses or medicines, were placed on the plate. Sticky notes (in a contrasting color) with terse, one-line descriptions of a specific activity that needed to be done, were placed at odd angles on the rim of the plate. This device, which could be vividly recalled as needed, reduced the frequency of every- day memory lapses an average of 57 percent to 65 percent. 3 What a wonderful idea and so simple and inexpensive an approach. Just remember that we are going for visually memorable, and the more obnoxious the color combination, the better. Here are a few other strategies: • Make a list. • Place frequently needed objects in the same place. • Leave yourself notes. • Twist your watch around on your wrist so that every oc- casion you check for the time and have to turn the watch, you can rehearse what you are trying to remember. Now we want to give you the chance we promised you to test your cognitive abilities, learn some remediation strate- gies, practice them, and test your cognitive abilities again. Be- fore you start, though, we want to remind you of a few things. • You tested yourself already to determine whether you are an auditory, visual, or kinesthetic learner. While try- ing to incorporate the mental exercises and techniques that follow, try to use your preferred method of re- hearsal. Also, include the other techniques as much as possible, even if they are not your preferred method. You want all of those areas recording information, and the more modes of inputting information you use, the more you should recall. • Similar memories may be confusing due to the number of associations in your mind. Try to find the differences among the various techniques as well as the similarities. Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility • 213"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"For example, can you remember the details of the last time you went to the bank? You probably can remember going to a grandchild’s recital, however. Unique situa- tions stick in your mind, while many instances of the same situation may run together. • If you are practicing one of the techniques or complet- ing an exercise, distractions may make you forget where you were. So if you get lost in the middle of an exercise, perhaps you should find a good starting point and go again. Try to notice whether you lose track of what you’re doing with or without distractions. • Some information never makes it to long-term memory. Not paying adequate attention accounts for approxi- mately 50 percent of reported memory problems. Con- centrate on what you want to remember. Try to make associations and use some of the techniques previously discussed. The inability to rapidly form associations is what accounts for much of the effect of aging on mea- sured cognitive abilities. If you need to remember something you need to do, concentrate and come up with little sayings or rhymes, or even write it down so that it w ill make more associations. The more you as- sociate new information with items alr eady firmly en- trenched in your memory, the more likely you will be able to recall the new information successfully. • One of the most common complaints by the elderly (and the young) is the increasing inability to recall names and particular words. The tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon is when individuals know that they know the name but cannot recall it at that particular moment. Ninety-two percent of the time, when older adults say they know a name but just cannot immediately recall it, they are correct. They actually do know it. Therefore, when people say they know something, believe them. One research study demonstrated a 48 percent retrieval success rate within two to three minutes without any external aids. 214 • Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"These were the strategies used for successful retrieval in the study previously described: • 27 percent use an alphabet strategy. (I know it starts with a “b.”) • 10 percent use a visualization strategy. (Where was the last time I saw those?) • 26 percent use an association strategy. (Let’s see, I know that he works with Jane t...) • 37 percent use a pop-into-the-head (in a blinding flash of light) strategy. 4 So if you just know you have the answer to the exercises and games, try one of the strategies just mentioned and give yourself two to three minutes to locate and retrieve the needed information before you give up on yourself. Are any of these strategies and techniques new? Are you learning a new skill? In the beginning, it is hard to remem- ber details (such as how to decide what the next number in a series is), but with more repetition and experience, you can create more associations and remember strategies easily and efficiently. Does it take longer to learn? It may while you are inte- grating new techniques. Don’t be discouraged. Keep these tips in mind: • Be aware. Now you know you may have to work harder. • Pay attention. Concentrate on what you really want to remember. • Associate. Associate what you want to know with what you already know. • Practice remembering. Choose a technique and try it out. Do you recall Gardner’s multiple intelligences presented in Chapter 2? We used them to identify the various areas of Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility • 215"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"the brain that perform different types of functions.

MENTAL AGILITY EXERCISES Inductive Reasoning One of the key questions regarding intelligence or high mental ability is whether a person can recognize patterns"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"and predict the next item in a pattern. This is called inductive reasoning. To a large extent, inductive reasoning is a learned skill. For the most difficult problems, however, insight and creativity are needed — two qualities that are considered to be possessed by very intelligent people. On the Mental Abil- ity Pretest, the questions that ask for the next item in a se- quence are inductive-reasoning problems. A large portion of inductive-reasoning problems involves numbers, and a word of caution is required here. It is not un- common for people to slide over numbers while they are read- ing. Numbers are not perceived to be important for some people. In fact, they think the numbers are superfluous, inter- rupt their reading, and get in the way of the meaning of the sentences. If you consider yourself a number skipper, you might think about developing a facility for observing and in- corporating numbers into the text you read. Some people are fond of saying, “Oh, I’ve never been very good at math.” Well, here is your chance to get good at math. There is a saying in mathematics that “a mathematician is a pattern seeker.” The following section will help you develop pattern-seeking skills. You can employ several strategies to determine a nu- merical pattern from a sequence of numbers. The place to start is identifying the pattern. In the following sequence, you can predict the next number: 1,2,3,4,5,6, . . . The next number is, of course, 7. You knew that. What you may not realize is that you recognized the pattern as the counting numbers and retrieved the seven from long-term memory. There are so many connections to this pattern of numbers that you probably were not aware of the recall mechanism at work! This process of immediate recall is quite different from problem solving. In problem solving, you do not have the answer already stored in memory. You must identify the question, note all of the facts you alr eady have, and then determine what is missing. After you figure out what is missing, the creative work begins. We will apply this sequence of steps to a few inductive-reasoning numerical problems. 222 • Chapter 7 @"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Find the next term in this sequence: 5, 10, 15, 20, . . . To solve this problem, you would go through these steps: 1. Identify the question. You need to find the next num- ber in the sequence. 2. Note all of the facts you already have. You have four terms already. They appear to be a collection of 1s, 5s, and 0s, with one 2. 3. Determine what is missing. You don’t know the pat- tern. (You may know already, but it will help to follow the sequence of inductive-reasoning steps to learn the process). 4. Do some creative work. Take a look at how each term is built from the ones before it. Notice that the numbers go up by 5 each time. This is the five times table. You have 1 × 5, 2 × 5, 3 × 5, and 4 × 5. Predict that the next term is 5 × 5 = 25. Find the next term in this sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . Follow these steps: 1. Identify the question. You need to find the next num- ber in the sequence. 2. Note all of the facts you already have. You have seven terms already. Except for the second term, they increase in value. The increase is not the same. 3. Determine what is missing. You don’t know the pat- tern. 4. Do some creative work. Take a look at how each term is built from the one before it. Notice that 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, and 5 + 8 = 13. Each number after the first two is the sum of the two numbers before it. Predict that 8 + 13 = 21 is the next term in the sequence. This is a famous sequence called the Fibonacci sequence, named after the Italian mathematician who studied Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility • 223"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"it. For a more in-depth treatment of the sequence, visit the Web site www.mathacademy.com/platonic_realms/en- cyclop/articles/fibonac.html. This next sequence takes you up a notch on the difficulty scale! Find the next term in this sequence: 1,101,1101,101101, . . . Follow these steps: 1. Identify the question. You need to find the next num- ber in the sequence. 2. Note all of the facts you already have. You have four terms already. They appear to be a collection of 1s and 0s. 3. Determine what is missing. You don’t know the pattern. 4. Do some creative work. Take a look at how each term is built from the terms before it. Notice from 1 to 101, it looks as if 1, 101, you put a 10 in front of the 1 to make the second term. But you didn’t do that for the third 1, 101, 1101, term.You put a 1 in front of the second term. Notice the fourth term. Here you are 1, 101, 1101, 101101 back to putting a 10 in front. So, now you guess that you put a 1 1, 101, 1101, 101101, 1101101 in front of the fourth term to make the fifth term. Notice that the word is guess. That’s the best you can do for inductive reasoning. Whatever pattern you make up, someone else might devise a different pattern. Here are a few other common strategies for finding the next number in a sequence.

In general, having good spatial-relationship skills means that you are comfortable and working well with the three-dimen- sional world. Kinesthetic learners usually have wonderful spa- tial-relationship skills. They seldom get lost. They know where their keys are! They function well with their bodies. Often, they are fine athletes. They make fine quilters. They generally pos- sess the body/kinesthetic intelligence Gardner tells us about. Those of us without a native ability in this area require training to develop spatial-relationship skills. This section provides an introduction to and exercises in spatial relationships (SR). First, consider inductive reasoning with objects. This will carry over from the previous section and tie in spatial skills. You will use a table of objects as your “space.” Each section of your table contains a special character, a i . If you would like to name this object, and some of you will find no need to do so, you may call it a burst. Notice that the location of the i varies in each cell. iii iii iii"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Each i occupies a different combination of top, middle, bottom, left, center, and right of the cell. No two i are in the same location within the cell. You now will observe a se- quence of squares and predict the next location of the i in each square. Use T, M, or B to identify the vertical location, and L, C, or R to identify the horizontal location of the i . In the following figure, the i is located as: Enjoy Your Ageless Mental Agility • 231 TL TC TR MR BR ii i i i TL TC TR MR BR BC BL ii i i iii Predict where the next two i would go based on the pat- tern established. It appears that the i is moving across the top row (TL, TC, TR), down the right column (TR, MR, BR). You may predict that the pattern looks as it appears in the following table. However, you may have identified another pattern altogether! Visit the Web site www.mentalagility.com for an in- teractive version of this exercise. A second type of spatial relationship is rotation of an ob- ject. You will consider this in two dimensions — that is, on a flat surface, such as this page, and also in three-dimensional space. This is very difficult, and you may find yourself want- ing to stop before you arrive at a solution. The advice we can offer that will help you to grow new brain cells is: Keep go- ing! Press on!

The die on the left was first rolled so that the 6 pips (dots) were on the top. 2. Then it was turned 90 degrees to the left. It also may help to find a pair of dice and try to set them up to match the picture. As a kinesthetic learner, you will want to turn them in your hands to help verify this result. Did you notice that all dice are alike in the placement of the pips? That’s a standardization you may not have been aware of! Now notice that the dice in options b, c, and d in the exercise are not even regulation dice. How can you tell? Hint: Try to arrange a die to resemble the dice in b, c, and d."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Another nifty fact about dice is that the opposite sides al- ways add up to seven. That means that the 1 is opposite the 6, the 2 is opposite the 5, and the 3 is opposite the 4. Using this extra fact, along with strategies you learned in the ear- lier example, find the die on the right that is a copy of the die on the left in Figure 7-7. 234 • Chapter 7 Did you select c? Visualize the rotation of the die on the left to match the die lettered c. First turn the die 180 degrees clockwise until you can see the 1 on the front. Then roll it over on its side, so that the 5 is on top. Now the die matches view c. This will take some practice. Use the die if that helps. You also could solve this puzzle by eliminating incorrect dice. You can eliminate both dice a and d, because they have adjacent (not opposite) faces that add up to seven pips. Ad- ditionally, die b has an incorrect face. The two pips on the top face are in the wrong corners. Check this with a regula- tion die if you like.

This is an interesting note for math lovers on the possible number of arrangements of a set of letters in a word. The number of arrangements of letters in a word of all different letters is calculated by a formula known as a factorial. Sup- pose that there are five letters in a word. Imagine five blanks: _ _ _ _ _ . Where might you place the first letter? You have five choices. Then there are only four places left for the second letter, three for the third letter, two for the fourth let- ter, and then only one place remains for the last letter. Mul- tiply 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. The result is 120. Mathematicians devised shorthand for writing out this problem: 5!. The ex- clamation point is read as “factorial.” 5! is read as “5 factor- ial.” So 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.

Number of Days in Each Month You may recall the jingle for remembering the number of days in each month. “Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November. All the rest have 31, except February.” This is an example of a mnemonic device. This works very well for an auditory learner. However, a kinesthetic or visual learner may experience difficulty remembering the order of the months in that device. A visual learner may remember the number of days in a month by remembering what a calendar looks like. For a kinesthetic learner, there is another way to remember the number of days in a month. It uses your hands as a tool. Make a pair of fists, as shown in Figure 7-8. Notice that your knuckles form peaks and valleys. Start at the left hand, first knuckle, and recite the months of the year, in order, using peaks and valleys. When you run out of knuckles on your left hand, go to your right hand for August on the first knuckle. Continue until you reach December. Notice that all of the months you named by a knuckle have 31 days. Those you named by a valley do not. All of those months, except Febru- ary, have 30 days. Most people remember about February. As an exercise, explain this calendar mechanism to some- one. Tell him it is a great mnemonic device — a handy digital device, solar powered, and pocket-sized.

This exercise was invented by Keith Harmeyer and his for- mer student, Lee Steer, as they conversed while Lee was in college. At the end of each letter, Keith would add a new So I Says, and in return, Lee would add one to her letters. You can use this game to build your auditory learning skills. In each of the following lines, you can respond by selecting a name that sounds like a word that is described by the first part of the sentence. For example: If I were to say to you, “So I says to the guy changing his tire, I says, Jack!” You would re- alize that a jack is used to change a tire and it is the name of a person. The coincidence of sounds introduces humor, we hope. Your job is to notice how many words sound like com- mon names.

The object of the game is to roll the dice as many times as you like on your turn, adding up the pips on the dice with the goal of eventually reaching 100. However, if you roll a 1 on either die, your score stays the same. If you roll snake eyes (a 2), your turn is over and your score reverts to 0. Otherwise, add the total of the pips to your score. End your turn when you decide to or if you roll snake eyes. Then the other person begins to roll the dice. The first person to reach 100 wins. Try to predict when you might roll snake eyes. Deter- mine how likely it is to roll them. Develop a strategy for winning this game. If you are lucky, you can get to 100 on one turn without rolling snake eyes. How much luck do you think there is in this game? Can you compensate with a clever strategy? How lucky do you feel today? At the beginning, you may want to use a paper and pencil to keep the totals. As you increase your concentration powers, you will want to keep the totals in your head, for both players. FIGURE AND GROUND Whenever a figure is drawn in a frame, the space becomes divided into two sections: the figure (or foreground) and the ground (or background). For some highly visual people with great spatial-relationship skills, the figure and ground readily change places. Consider the drawing in Figure 7-12. Let’s say this figure shows steps in your home. Are you looking at them from above or from below? It depends on what part of the picture your mind assigns to the back- ground and what part it assigns to the foreground. When the foreground is in the lower left corner, it appears that the steps are below you. However, if you can make your brain decide that the foreground is in the upper right, it appears that the steps are above you, as if you were standing on a basement step looking up. @"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"262 • Chapter 7 This same phenomenon applies to these stylized silhou- ettes of people in Figure 7-13.

Each of the other players creates a fictional definition for the obscure word on a separate piece of paper. Then Lex collects the papers and shuffles the papers. Lex reads each definition. Each player selects the definition he or she thinks is correct. Scoring is based on how well you fool other play- ers and how difficult the word is that Lex selects. Lex gets one point for every player who did not choose the correct de- finition. All players get one point for every player who chose their definition, and one point if they guess the correct defi- nition. That constitutes one round. Play enough rounds so that each player has a chance to be Lex. There are hilarious moments. Hearing people’s definitions for words about which they have no clue can be a hoot. This game is sure to help your auditory skills by practicing your concentration on the reading of the definitions. Some wonderful words spawn some clever, albeit incor- rect, definitions. Here are a few real definitions: bon’te bok, n . a species of purplish-red antelope of South Africa flot, n . scum, floating grease, as in fatty broth moff, n . a light silk fabric woven in the Caucasus my’ta cism, n. abnormally frequent or incorrect use of the letter m It would be very difficult to believe that these were the cor- rect definitions for these otherwise normal-sounding words!

After a year starts, there are only two options for the rest of the days. Either the year is a leap year and there is an extra day in February, or it is not a leap year. So, we need seven different calendars for a leap year and seven more for a non — leap year. To investi- gate further, use the words “perpetual calendar” to aid in your search. The year 1999 started on a Friday. It is the same calendar we used in 1993. The next non — leap year that starts on a Fri- day is 2010. Save your old 1999 calendar and use it again in 2010. The year 2000 calendar gets a rerun in 2028. Boxer Rebellion These figures make boxes without lids: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12.

By now, you know how important the learning process is to regaining and maintain- ing your mental agility. The very process of reading this book has generated millions of neuron signals that passed through previously existing connections. Other millions of signals have caused the creation of new connections. We hope you tried the various activities as you pro- gressed through this book. You can continue to reinforce these learning and memory strategies throughout the rest of your life. Lifelong learning can take place anywhere, at any time. We recommend that you explore other materials relat- ing to these topics. Start with the resources in the appen- dixes. If you were interested in some of the health issues, for example, go to the library, or go out on the Internet and re- search the topic. Apply the various strategies to learning about information pertinent to your lifestyle. But remember as you become comfortable with a topic or skill to stretch yourself again mentally and move on to other new and novel experiences and topics. Let us offer one last caution. We are bombarded daily with fast, easy solutions for everything from weight loss to brain enhancement. To paraphrase Euclid, there is no royal road to mental agility.

After a full career as an administrative assistant in an engineering department at a major oil company, Dorothy took early retirement at age 57. Her first reaction was “ What am I going to do with myself?” Dorothy had always wanted to go to college, so she enrolled in the Community College of Baltimore County, Maryland. Because her job had become so automatic in the last few years, Dorothy felt that she hadn’t learned much and was concerned about the chal- lenge of college work. Dorothy took one course, German, the first semester to “see if my mind still worked.” She experienced success and traveled to Germany to practice her newfound skills. Dorothy wants to take hard courses and is working up to tak- ing calculus. She tries out a course to see whether she can keep up. If it gets too hard, she doesn’t quit. She simply switches to audit the course and tries again for credit the next semester. “I’m really enjoying what I am doing,” says Dorothy. She is using her brain in new and novel ways.

It takes hard work and consistent effort to pro- duce results—but what remarkable results they will be! We would like to leave you with two fundamental con- cepts to mull over in your newly energized mind. Of primary importance to you are the research results that served as the basic motivation for this book. Dr. K. Warner Schaie, whose longitudinal studies focused on the effects of aging, became especially concerned with elders who, because of their mental decline, were dependent on others to care for them. His desire was to find a way to help these elders to regain enough mental ability to bring them back, or to slow the decline, so that they might live inde- pendently for a longer period of time. What he and his team found applies to all aging adults: Use your brain in new and novel ways, and you can enjoy ageless mental agility. Second, we want you to realize that these are measures for Jane and Joe ordinary guy and gal on the street. The mea- sures are not extraordinary. However, if you apply them daily, the cumulative effect is truly extraordinary. We’re not talking about the Sophia Lorens or John Glenns of the world. We’re talking about ordinary people with ordinary lives who can make their brains extraordinary simply by fol- lowing the ideas in this book. So, in summary, keep mentally and physically active. In- teract with others on a daily basis. Get proper nutrition and plenty of sleep. Above all else, keep learning. Never stop learning! Every day do something to use your brain in a new and novel way, and you can enjoy ageless mental agility. “You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.” — Les Brown Epilogue • 295"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"297 Appendix A Annotated List of Learning Opportunities for Senior Citizens This appendix contains a list of educational and travel op- portunities you may find helpful in increasing your mental agility.

Elderhostel was founded at the University of New Hampshire as a nonprofit organization in 1975 by Marty Knowlton, a social activist and former educator, and David Bianco, a university administrator, to provide challenging educational opportunities for older adults. In the summer of 1975, five colleges and universities in New Hampshire of- fered the first Elderhostel programs to 220 “pioneer” hostel- ers. The enthusiasm was so great that when the participants were asked about their experiences, every single participant said he or she would return to Elderhostel in 1976. In 1976 more than 2,000 hostelers participated; thus began the rapid growth of Elderhostel. 1 For questions regarding program details, enrollment, fu- ture program offerings, program availability, deposits, and so on, • Call toll free at (877) 426 — 8056. • Callers outside the U.S. and Canada: please dial (617) 426 — 7788. • Hearing-impaired individuals can call toll free TTY at (877) 426 — 2167."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"LIFELONG LEARNING IN THE USA Most states in the U.S. have tuition abatement or reduction programs for senior citizens.

Basically, it is a clever, easy way to use the Internet to get information with a minimum of fuss. What we need to know to begin using it is very little. It’s really a vocabulary lesson when we get right down to it. In the next few paragraphs, we will define the terms you may or may not have heard relating to the World Wide Web, or WWW, for short. You then will be able to use “old” technology, the telephone, to order what you need to get up and running on the Web. But first, let’s talk about a good reason why this appen- dix is in a book on new learning techniques. The ability to learn new things is pretty useless without resources to help you learn what you want to know more about. The Internet is chock full of new information. But if you can’t access it, what good is it? This appendix will help you learn the basics so that you can acquire the resources you need to begin learning what is on the Internet. One of the organizations that helps is the SeniorNet. Be- fore you think that this is an organization simply for older people, you should know that SeniorNet is a nonprofit group that helps bring technology to all people over the age of 30. The number of seniors who have access to the Internet"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"324 • Appendix C rose from 17 percent in 1995 to a whopping 75 percent in 1998, says Eileen Colkin, a contributing author to Informa- tion Week . 1 Here are some other interesting numbers Eileen re- ported: • 15 percent of seniors classify themselves as heavy users (more than 10 hours online per week). • 70 percent use electronic mail, or e-mail. • 40 percent check out hobby- or health-related sites. • 38 percent visit investment sites. The difference between the WWW and the Internet is a bit blurred. The WWW is a part of the Internet. When you use a computer program called a browser, you are viewing “pages” on the Web. Other activities occur on the Internet, but we gen- erally use the WWW to access free information. The Internet is the collection of individual computer networks all over the world that exchange information. The WWW is the collection of computers (Web servers) that provide specially formatted pages for people using a browser. Examples of browsers are Netscape Navigator™, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer™, and America Online’s™ (AOL’s) user programs. If you want to access the information on all of these computers all over the world, you need to have Internet ser- vice. A company that connects your computer to the Internet is called an Internet service provider (ISP). Samples of these are America Online, Erols, Compuserve, @Home, Microsoft Network (MSN), and many, many others. Each provider charges a bit differently for its service to you. So, you need a computer and an ISP. The ISP provides the browser for your use. You also need a modem and a mouse. A modem connects your computer to the ISP and then to the Internet through your telephone line. In some areas, your local cable com- pany offers a high-speed modem that connects you to the Internet via fiber-optic cable. A mouse is a device that en- ables you to perform a number of operations on the com-"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"puter without having to type a great deal on the computer’s keyboard. This is a bonus for those of us who are still one- finger typists! Using a browser is quite easy, once you get the hang of it. It communicates with the other computers on the Web to lo- cate information for you. The information is organized into collections of Web pages located all around the world. These collections are called Web sites. Each Web page has a unique identifier — a name, if you like. This is called its uniform re- source locator , or URL. You can’t miss URLs in our culture to- day. You see them at the bottom of the TV screen in advertisements, in magazines, on vehicles, on billboards — just about everywhere. They generally start out with these three lowercase letters: www . For example, the Web site asso- ciated with this text is www.mentalagility.com . If you know the addr ess of a page, you can type it into your browser, and the Web finds the page you want and displays it on your computer. This process is called downloading. After you find a page you are interested in, you will find blue highlighted and/or underlined words or phrases. These are called hyperlinks, or links for short. After you click on one of these links with your mouse, you get another Web page to look at without having to type in the URL. When you are moving around the Internet by clicking links, you are said to be surfing the Net. If you don’t know the address of a specific page, but you know what you are looking for by name, you can use a search engine. This is special type of Web page that locates other Web pages for you. Examples of search engines are www.altavista.com , www.yahoo.com , and www.snap.com . An easy search en- gine to use is AskJeeves. This site accepts English sentences and searches for what you want. For example, you might want to ask “How many senior citizens have computers?” Visit www.AskJeeves.com and type in your question. Jeeves will provide a list of Web sites to visit to answer that question. See Figure C-1. Most people join the Internet for one reason: e-mail.

Usually, you get an e-mail account in- cluded with your Internet service. There are also free e-mail accounts, provided by several Web pages that show adver- tisements. You can identify an e-mail address by its characteristic structure. At the front of an e-mail address is a person or a code for a person’s name. In the middle is the @ sign.

Many people are finding it fun and easy to send photos attached to an e-mail message. They have a device attached to their computers called a scanner. A scanner copies a phys- ical photograph into an electronic version that can be sent across the Internet and viewed at another computer. You can access other features on the Internet with an ISP. There are archives of conversations on myriad topics, called newsgroups. There are discussion groups you can join to ex- change e-mail messages, called mailing lists.

And generally, the price is very small if you do decide to keep the software. And, you can type in a message in a live conversation with other people using the Internet. This activity is called chat. Whatever you decide to use the Internet for, you will learn new things, feel connected to the world, exercise old connections, and create new connections as you learn how to use the Internet. In this appendix, we have collected a list of interesting sites for you to visit as you learn how to use the Internet. A word of caution, though: The Internet is a dynamic place. New pages are posted daily, and old ones are removed. Some people move their Web pages around. The problem is that an address may have changed. If the browser cannot lo- cate a page you specify, try typing the simple Web site name without all of the extra parts of the address. For example, there is a wonderful card trick puzzle on this page: www3. mcps.k12.md.us/users/rsfay/magic . However, the owner, Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, may choose to move it around in the future. Try typing in just the first half of the address: www3.mcps.k.12.md.us and surfing to find the card trick. As an assistance, the authors will keep an up-to-date list of these addresses that you can check out on www. mentalagility.com . Do not call the publisher!
