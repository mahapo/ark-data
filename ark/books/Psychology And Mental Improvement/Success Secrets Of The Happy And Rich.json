Over the past three decades, many mentors, heroes, and role models have crossed my path. W ithout the teachings and wisdom of each one of these men and women, my understanding of the life principles I am sharing inside these pages would be tremendously hindered. Thank you for sharing via your books, seminars, videos, and one-on-one chats. In order to create the space and find the time to undertake such a task as writing a book of this depth, it was necessary to have sup - port in many areas of my life. As usual, my father Curtis Baggett was always willing to lend a helping hand. Kay Keeton kept my training school HandwritingUniversity.com running smoothly while I was away writing. Honlee Beattie spent valuable time editing my early lecture transcripts into understandable literature. Mary Goldthorp kept me emotionally balanced and was instrumental in helping me make more leaps of personal growth during the peak of my writing sebatacle. And finally, the person who has contributed most to the completion and polishing of this work of art is Brian Moreland. Brian has not only been an outstanding editor and con - tributor to this book, but has been a coach, director, and close friend. W ithout Brian, this book would not have turned out on time or with the level of literary quality it is. Brian’s contributions were nothing short of spectacular . Thanks to all of you.

The trees are lush and green, the sky a bright cobalt blue. Birds are chirping overhead, and the scent of fresh pine fills your nose. Y ou pass over a bridge where a stream is trickling over rocks. On the other side of the bridge, you find yourself at a fork in the woods, where the path leads off into two directions. Y ou see two arrow-shaped signs in the center of the fork, describing the two paths you are now considering. One sign explains that the path on the left leads to a continuation of your life exactly as it is now . While the path on the right leads to a new life where you are richer , happier, healthier and more balanced. Y ou have new tools and new beliefs to achieve your greatest desires.

Y ou recognize that written on the scroll is a list of your highest dreams and desires. The things in life you want most. Y ou know them well.

I have spent half my life investigating the personality traits, behaviors and life strategies of successful people. I can remember reading the biography of Benjamin Franklin when I was just 12- years-old. From that book, I learned many great habits that still serve me well. I've probably read 500 biographies of men and women who have achieved some level of greatness in their lives. Furthermore, my career as an author and entrepreneur has allowed me introductions and access to many super wealthy and powerful people. In each case, I have tried to extract a kernel of wisdom or a nugget of advice on how to achieve more success. As you read this book, you’ll find out what criteria, what per - sonality traits it takes to be truly successful. Does it take integrity? Does it take diplomacy? Compassion? A high self-image?

Now that I have your curiosity peaked, you’re probably won - dering ... what are the Success Secrets of the rich and happy? Is there a universal formula to lifelong happiness? Is there an ancient scroll with the secret to accumulating piles of cash and laughing all the way to the bank? If there truly were such a hidden \"scroll to success,\" it wouldn't include financial spreadsheets and stock tips. It wouldn’t talk about exactly what to do to become rich and happy . Instead, I imagine it would include more noble lessons on who you need to be in order to attract wealth, influential people, resources and opportunities. This scroll would tell curious minds basic princi - ples of the universe, so they can work with the laws of nature instead of against them. In order for such an ancient scroll to have value in today's world, it would have to discuss humanity on a basis that would last generations. Therefore, a discussion about which technology stock to invest in or the latest tax loophole would not have much value in the long term.

I think we’ve all heard about the John Belushi and Elvis Presley types, where happiness still eluded them, despite their vast fame and fortune. What holds people back from truly achieving suc - cess and happiness? What makes people sabotage themselves once they reach their goals? W e’ll explore what works and what doesn’t.

W ith over sixteen years of experience as a handwriting expert, author and speaker, I’ve found that successful people have many personality and character traits in common. Before we get into the nitty gritty of this book, let’s find out if you can guess who these \"great\" people are. Let’s take a brief look at three biographical profiles of well-known, influential and suc - cessful people. What did it take to accomplish what they’ve accom - plished? What kind of character does it take to be this successful? Throughout this book, we will take a look at the character traits of successful people, such as the three popular heroes below. I will also reveal to you the belief systems and thought processes typical of such influential individuals. #1 W HO IS THIS GREA T MAN ? He was imprisoned in South Africa for 27 years, locked up in his cell during daylight hours, enduring the prime years of his life as a political prisoner . An opponent of the reigning government that endorsed apartheid, he wanted black people to have equal rights in their own country. He was peacefully working for a free and fair democracy in South Africa. When the South African government 9 Chapter 1 - Your Invitation to Gr e a t n e s s Most people do not really know what they want. They are not sure of their destiny and not clear on what will satisfy them at the deepest levels. Most people can write down a list of the things they don't want in life. Do you have such a list? (Struggle, arguments, an angry boss, disease, screaming kids, mean people, etc.) This list can be useful, but it doesn't program your brain to attract what you want. In fact, the more you focus on what you don’t want, the more you are programming your brain to bring more of it into your world. This is an example of an ineffective internal program. In this book, you will learn how to stop running negative programs and start run - ning positive ones that attract what you really want. First, you have to write the new program. I’ll show you how. Here is the first step. I ask you again, what do you want? Here is a game. Please play along. Imagine a MAGICAL WIZARD is standing in front of you right now. He is wearing a long silver robe, a pointy hat and holding his magic wand. He says, \"I am your own personal wizard. When I wave this magic wand, instantly your deepest desire will create into reality. I have no limitations - just speak it and it will be manifest - ed.\" So tell me, what do you want? W ould it be a bag full of cash, a paid college education for your kids, a life of champagne and caviar, lose four dress sizes, or would it be a better golf swing, a million dollars, or a new car ... you name it. Now, take a moment and pretend you did have a wizard, and you could create a life with no limitations. What would that life look like? It has been my experience, once I learned how to really run my mind, that I could work it as if I truly had a wizard inside me ... waiting for the instructions in a way he could understand them. So I invite you to imagine that you have a wizard inside you, 8 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"#3 W HO IS THIS GREA T WOMAN ? She was born poor and raised in a household where she was sexually molested. She could have chosen hundreds of excuses ranging from poverty, racism, prejudice, glass ceiling, etc. But she succeeded anyway. She is arguably the most influencial woman in America in an industry dominated by powerful men (television.) And, she is one of the wealthiest and highest paid women in America influencing millions of people daily via her TV talk show . There are key personality traits that these three heroes have in common. The one central theme that great people possess is some - thing all of us can have: a compelling mission. Each of these men made a decision to take on a mission that was greater than them - selves. When you have a compelling and powerful mission that strikes an emotional chord in your soul, you can overcome many obstacles who otherwise would seem insurmountable.

This for - mer American astronaut was a renown hero all over the world in 1962. After that event, he went on to have a successful career as a politician -- a Democratic Senator from Ohio. Then on October 29, 1998, he flew back into space again, aboard the space shuttle Discovery . That trip earned him the title of the oldest man ever to take a space journey .

Y ou might have had to change a light bulb, paint a wall, tighten a screw on a wobbly chair . When you do decide to fix things, isn't it easier to have all the tools you need within arms reach? Do you have a tool belt or toolbox? Even though my house doesn't need lots of attention, I do have a red toolbox I go to as soon as I find an area that needs improving. If the tool I need is in the toolbox, the repair is quick and easy. If the tool I need isn't there, the repair problem becomes more frustrating, takes longer , and often doesn't get fixed at all. For me, when I approach the human psyche, I picture the differ - ent avenues of psychology like a big tool belt. When I learned hand - writing analysis, it became one of my tools in my tool belt. For instance, I could meet someone, and in about two or three minutes I would know what he's scared of, how emotional he is, how good his self-image is, even his sex drive and his integrity . All these different personality traits I can tell thanks to the science of handwriting analysis. But if I wanted to help this person stop smoking or overcome depression, I probably wouldn't use just the tool of handwriting analysis. That would be like using a screwdriver to hammer in a ten-inch nail. There are better tools for that job. I would turn to hypnosis to assist him to stop smoking. For depression, I might use some NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) 13 Chapter 1 - Your Invitation to Gr e a t n e s s life. Y ou sure don't have to free an entire country, topple a govern - ment or rocket into space to make a difference. Y ou do have to find a compelling purpose that will drive you and allow you to satisfy all of your basic human needs. One of those needs is the need to make a difference and/or contribute to others. I will discuss the other five basic human needs in chapter 10. Once you find a career or purpose that satisfies all of these basic needs, you will find deep satisfaction effortless to achieve. As you study the thought processes of great men and women, you will realize they have a predictable set of beliefs and values that run their lives. Likewise, miserable angry criminals who create pain and torment in the world have a very different set of values, beliefs and purpose. In the coming section, you will have an opportunity to elicit the beliefs and values that you currently hold. Then, you will be given the opportunity to decide if these are beliefs that will take you where you really want to go. For most people, our beliefs and even our values were given to us in childhood without our permission. W e simply adopted them without knowing we have a choice. People who are \"in the flow\" of lots of cash have very specific beliefs about the nature of money and how it works. Likewise, people who have wonderful marriages and close loving friends have specific beliefs about people, love and relationships. Many people naively believe that the reason people have such positive ideas about money or love is because they have an abun - dance of it in their life. It actually works the opposite way . They have an abundance of love, money and happiness, because the beliefs, values, and ideas they hold about these things \"attracted\" them into their life. Their beliefs and values lead them to their desired outcomes. Change yourself first.

Y ou don't have to use the \"automatic sander,\" but trying to sand a desk by hand might take three times as long and won't look as good. The tools in this book are very effective and usually fast, as well. Many of the successful men and women I reference in this book might never have heard of these tools. That doesn't surprise me. These tools are designed to adjust your thinking to be more like the person you aspire to be. If you already have a powerful \"wealth consciousness,\" you wouldn't need to adjust it. If you grew up in a family that truly convinced you that you were worthy and loved, you might not need to boost your self-esteem. I have used each one of these tools to positively affect my life. I know from experience that they work. Here is a brief description of some tools that I have found trans - form the mind very quickly: • Goal Setting – Defining your highest goals • Changing Belief Systems – Creating new beliefs that empow - er you to be the person you choose to be • Eliciting V alues – Discovering what emotion is most impor - tant to you, what you value most in life • Handwriting Analysis – The science of determining personal - ity and character from someone's handwriting • Modeling Successful People – Doing what successful people do to be successful yourself • Grapho-Therapy – Changing your handwriting to change your behaviors • Six Human Needs – A model of your life and your interaction with people – also understanding the reasons you do what you do and how you feel fulfilled 15 Chapter 1 - Your Invitation to Gr e a t n e s s or T ime-Line Therapy techniques as well as take a serious look at the nutritional/chemical side of that condition. There are many dif - ferent tools to change ourselves and affect the quality of our lives. If your life is not everything you want it to be - right now - you will want to grab an effective tool and go to work on yourself. If you're having a lot of energy problems, I'm not going to say , \"Change your handwriting. This is going to solve your problems.\" I'm going to say, \"Let's talk about getting you to exercise more or change your diet.\" Or I might refer you to a medical doctor who specializes in energy related disease. There are all kinds of tools you can use to change your life. Y ou have to use the right tool for the situation. Because I've been attending self-improvement seminars and reading these types of books since I was 13 years old, I have seen many theories on personal change. I have found that handwriting analysis always ranks in the top five of the most useful tools. It's like a crescent wrench in your toolbox. Y ou can use it for so many different situations. But, handwriting analysis is just one of an assortment of amazing mental tools I will teach and reference in this book. I encourage you to approach these new tools like you would approach me handing you a piece of equipment in a workshop. If we were building a wooden desk together what tools would we need? If I ask you to pick up the \"automatic sander,\" what would you do? Just because you have never seen this tool before, you wouldn't assume it doesn't work. Y ou would simply ask what it is for and how to use it. Most likely, you would want to watch a demonstration to prove the tool works as I claim. Once you have used it once or twice, your comfort level and belief in this tool will increase. Then, you would probably choose to add it to your own tool belt.

Most business workshops I've attended forced me to write down my goals. W ell, sometimes I got what I wanted and often I did not cre - ate what I scribed. Statistics prove that writing down your goals dramatically increases the odds of being successful. 5% I S W ORTH M ORE T HAN T HE O THER 95% Harvard University conducted a study on the power of written goals. (It may have been Y ale circa 1955.) They asked the graduating class how many of them had written goals for their lifetime? Only five percent of the graduating class had written goals. T wenty years later, that five percent, (60 stu - dents) was worth 95 percent as much money as the rest of them. So out of the tens of millions of dollars that graduating class touched in their lifetime, this 5% controlled 95 percent of that cash. Why is that? Y ou can easily position yourself in the top 5% of the world. The simple act of getting clear on what you want gives your brain clear and concise instructions to follow . Y ou are telling your unconscious mind where you want to go. I want you to get more clarity about some of the things that you want.

In some cases, the goal and outcome will be the same word. In others, the outcome will reveal a deeper meaning. Be specific in describing your ideal outcome, and you’ll be surprised at how focused your intention will become. One thing is for sure ... you always get an outcome. In many cases, it might not be the outcome you were expecting. But, you will achieve an outcome. That’s why I emphasize writing down spe - cific outcomes. The more specific, the more likely you will achieve what you truly want. H OW I C REATED M Y G OALS AND F ORGOT TO G ET M Y O UTCOMES When I had just graduated from Pepperdine University, I had an interesting first hand experience with setting goals. I had lots of debt from the education and no cash savings. I said to myself, \"Okay, I want to be rich.\" I didn't have an obvious opportunity to make tons of cash. I didn't come from a rich family, but luckily I had a good education. Because I truly believed I could become wealthy, I focused my mind on finding out how . Although I had already begun earning $100 per hour as a handwriting expert, the work had not been consistent and I wanted to do something differ - ent. I moved to Las V egas and took a job at a major casino in a management training program. During the first three months, I think I was earning just $6 an hour. Later, I was earning more, but noth - ing to brag about. I knew I wanted to be a famous author and a well known speak - er. But, I hadn't really accomplished anything to speak or write about yet. (Details, details). So, after working a few months I found myself thinking, \"Bart, this is really going slow. I'm struggling financially. I'm not getting rich from working for someone else. 23 Chapter 2 -Goals & Outcomes in your life, more love, improved health, more wealth, or something else? This chapter will assist you in \"programming\" your brain to be automatically compelled to move towards these goals. As effective as simply writing down goals can be, we are going to apply 21st century mental tools to eliciting your inner desires. Y ou will learn how to do more than set goals. Y ou will learn how to install them and build your personality around happily and effortlessly achieving them. So, if goal setting only works for some... how can we improve on the process? If I were lazy, I could just assume you are reading this book to experience more abundance of money and happiness in your life. W e could skip right over this chapter and talk about ways to create exactly those two items. But, in truth, money and happiness are merely by-products of other areas of your life working effectively on autopilot. Instead of setting goals, I am requesting you create a list of \"outcomes.\" The reason we have changed the word is that your brain already knows it will always get an outcome. Y ou brain is probably unsure as to whether or not it will reach a goal. So, by set - ting a list of \"outcomes\" you have easier targets to move toward. Y our brain already feels more confident. The other reason I want you to focus on your \"outcome\" is that you can most likely achieve an \"outcome\" through a variety of means. This gives the \"universe\" more options when looking for ways to create for you. For example, if your outcome is to have a loving monogamous relationship, then, your brain has the option of finding you a lover, a friend, or a spouse. However, if you tell your brain you have a goal of being married by next year, then your brain is likely to find you a spouse, but it may not include the real out - come (feeling the benefits of a loving monogamous relationship.) So, instead of just writing down a goal, ask yourself what the 22 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"deal. It actually wasn't aired to the entire nation. It just aired on the East Coast. However, that experience allowed me to eventually appear on the Montel W illiams national TV show about a year later . I later found myself thinking, \"I got a free trip to New Y ork. I just got one of three goals accomplished, and it was basically hand - ed to me. They just called me.\" I felt lucky. But I knew my achieve - ment was based on more than luck. Luck is when opportunity meets someone who's prepared. I was prepared and I had \"spoken\" the desire to my friend Ross. I set the dominos in motion - the universe delivered. By the way, that appearance didn't make me any money. In fact, the next national TV show Montel W illiams didn't send people rush - ing to book stores either. I had set a goal, not an outcome. I should have set an outcome to sell 10,000 books. But, instead I made the assumption if I land on national TV, I will automatically sell enough books to make me rich. That wasn't the outcome I got. But, I did get one of the goals I asked for – to be on national TV . My second goal was getting a jeep. Now, I don't necessarily want to drive a jeep now, but when I was 22-years-old, a jeep was a really cool ride. At the time, I was driving a 1982 Buick Sedan De V ille. It was basically a tank built for a family of eight. It was so old I had to staple the headliner to the ceiling before each date so it wouldn't fall on her head when we hit a bump. I was really embar - rassed to own this car. Many times I thought to myself, \"Here I am writing a book on relationships, and I'm trying to convince a girl to like me, when I’m driving such a pathetic car.\" I was still reading all the books on success and trying to think positive. But it was hard to maintain a positive mental attitude, when I thought the car was so ugly. So I asked myself, \"How am I going to get a new car?\" I wasn't making enough money to buy a new car, so, I simply wrote down the goals and forgot about it. One day I was listening to a spiritual teacher discuss wealth and money. He said, \"Everything in your life is a reflection of who you 25 Chapter 2 -Goals & Outcomes What am I going to do?\" So, I signed up for a goal setting seminar . At 22-years-old, I set three goals for myself. They're not goals I would aspire to now, but at 22 I said to myself, \"By the time I turn 23 I want a new jeep, I want to be on national TV, and I want a book with my name on it in the bookstores. I want to walk into the bookstore and see a book on the bookshelf that I wrote.\" T o me, that would be success -- that would make me feel successful. That would be accomplishing something that would make me very proud. I thought those lofty goals would bring me happiness. Let me tell you how it turned out. Sometimes when you write down your goals, you don't even have to work for them. They just kind of show up magically . This is the power of your unconscious mind. Y our mind really is a \"manifesting machine.\" Program it, relax, and know your outcome is already in motion. In my case, all three goals were accomplished very close to the given date. One of the goals I worked my butt off for . T wo of them just came to be as a result of forces outside of myself. (But, I'm sure I set those forces in motion.) In 1991, I had not written a book yet. I had published the Grapho-Deck Handwriting T rait Cards and had appeared on a dozen or so small radio talk shows. I wasn't even a minor celebrity. How I was going to land a national TV show, I had no idea. About two weeks before my birthday, a friend of mine named Ross calls me, \"Bart, I'm going to New Y ork to be on the Jane Pratt Show. One of their guests canceled and I talked the producer into letting you take his place. Do you want to go to New Y ork, to be on national TV?\" It happened that fast. W e left three days later. I appeared as a guest expert talking about using handwriting analysis for dating.

I know I didn’ t crash my car on purpose. Those were two easy goals accomplished. Essentially, the uni - verse just handed me my first two goals without a lot of effort. Getting that first book written and published was not as effort - less. I had at least 30 rejection letters in my file from publishers. It took nine hard months to write and edit. Eventually, I chose the option of self-publishing the first book The Secrets T o Making Love Happen (Mastering Relationships using Handwriting Analysis). Now, guess what? I wasn't rich. I wasn't famous. But I had achieved all three of my goals, so that was good. Y et for some rea - son I still wasn't happy. I learned from that experience, that you have to evaluate your goals very carefully, know exactly what you want, and be specific. All of a sudden I had my books in bookstores and no one was buying them yet. I thought, \"Oopps, I forgot to state a specific out - come.\" For instance, I should have set the \"outcome\" to sell 100,000 books or earn $1 million dollars from book sales. Because my ego wanted to see myself on TV and see my book on the shelf, I set goals that did not get my true outcome. My \"outcome\" for this book is to make a difference in over a million people’s lives as a result of reading it. So, it really doesn't matter if I appear on nation - al TV shows or if it ever sits on a bookstore shelf. Now, in order to achieve my outcome, it is likely I will reach those milestones, but not necessary .

So if you're driving a cheap, ugly car, it's a reflection of who you are. It's a reflection of your self-esteem and your beliefs about money.\" I thought, \"Ooooh, I don't want to hear that. That's not me. I'm only 22. This is just temporary. Besides, the car was given to me. I'm really a total success.\" The spiritual teacher actually got me angry. I don't know if I was angry with him or myself. But the cruel reality of my world was that I was driving an '82 Buick with a bro - ken window and the ceiling falling down. I thought maybe, just maybe, he's right. Perhaps my current world really does reflect the quality of my thoughts. No more excuses. Just look around and take inventory . This is really what happened less than 30 minutes after hearing that lecture. On my way home, I was sitting at a red light, in the middle lane. I had this unexplainable desire to turn right. So I crossed two lanes of traffic and turned right on a red light. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very large tow-truck heading toward my rear bumper . The tow truck missed my bumper and slamed into the left side of my Buick crumpling the side of the car from the rear to the front. The crash was loud and startling. But, since the car weighed as much as an army tank, I survived with out injury . I thought, \"That was about the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life\" -- all for a right turn. I had no idea. It was like something possessed me to do this. I didn't put the two-and-two together until later. I got an envelope from the insurance company for $3,500 for the car repairs. So, I sold the old car for $500 and bought a $4000 used jeep. This is a roundabout way to get a goal, but your unconscious mind has a way of giving you what you want. I went, \"New jeep.

She was proudly showing me her latest report card. She had pulled four A's and two B+ grades. As we sat and discussed the various challenges of Math vs. Language vs. Science, I asked her why she made A's in some topics and only scored B's in other topics. Her answer was typical for a 10-year-old, \"I don't know.\" As I probed deeper, it didn’t surprise me to discover she actually enjoyed Science, Physical Education, and Social Studies classes. Furthermore, she found Math and Language quite tedious. I then asked Jessica, \"Do you notice that you make better grades in the subjects that you like?\" She responded, \"Well, I think Science is fun ... and, I want to be a marine biologist. So, science is easier because I like it.\" \"Really? That sounds interesting,\" I said. \"So you don’t think you will need to know Math as a marine biologist?\" I asked. \"I think you will have to use lots of math as any kind of scientist. But you might change your mind. I think you already know that if you are having fun, the math won't seem that hard. How much money does a marine biologist make?\" \"I don’t know .

I told T racy the bad news. \"Tracy, Jessica just informed me she is going to be poor the rest of her life, and she will not take care of you in your old age because she wants to be poor and work for a boss all of her adult life.\" Jessica became hostile and blurted out, \"I did not say that!\" \"You said you refused to be a millionaire because millionaires are snobs. In this day and age a million dollars isn't that much money. In fact, if you plan to own a house, raise a family, and take care of your mom, making a decision NOT to be rich is the same as making the decision to be poor.\" I turned to T racy, \"Don't worry T racy, perhaps your other daughter Stephanie will take care of you in your old age.\" Jessica was fuming at the turn of events in this debate. She was determined to hold on to her belief that all millionaires are snobs. T en-year-olds can be quite stubborn, so she stood up and asked knowingly, \"I’m not going to win this one, am I?\" \"Jessica, if you win this conversation and keep your beliefs you will lose in life. If you lose this conversation you will win in life. May I suggest you stop choosing to be right and start choosing to be happy?\" She took a moment to process my esoteric comment that I knew would most likely not be processed correctly by a stubborn, yet intelligent, ten-year-old. She then turned and announced, \"I’m leav - ing. I can’t win.\" 33 Chapter 3 -The Secret Power of Beliefs \"You can’t control how much money you make,\" Jessica responded with fervor . I queried the slightly confused 10-year-old, \"Who is in control of how much money you make?\" \"Your boss decides.\" \"Really?

Jessica rallied. \"So they decide how much money you make. Y ou don’t have any control over whether or not they will buy any - thing.\" \"That's not true.

Why is that?\" \"Because millionaires are snobs,\" Jessica said with conviction.

I have started this chapter by discussing money - but the ingrained beliefs about being happy, spiritual, loving, and living life on your own terms follow the same pattern.

Furthermore, if I have this conversation with an adult about his present financial situation, it is common to hear the excuses - not the possibilities. Adults will convince themselves they are just vic - tims of chance, luck, family, or bad timing. I'm wondering: Are you one of those people who may deny you might have limiting beliefs in this area? Here is a test. If you are lacking in any area of your life: love, family, money, spirituality, health, etc ... you have some limiting beliefs or destructive thinking patterns in that area. Period. End of story . And you’re not alone, because we all have limiting beliefs to some degree. Now, the proof of what is inside your mind is so clear all you have to do is look around you and take inventory . T ake inventory RIGHT NOW. Be honest. Y our thoughts have already cre - ated your reality. Do you like it? Can it be improved? Now, what reality are you going to create next? The reason I start this chapter on belief systems relaying a con - versation with a child is because most of our core personality traits, beliefs, values, and thinking habits were adopted during our child - hood. There are exceptions to this statement, but I find it is true in 35 Chapter 3 -The Secret Power of Beliefs I enjoy discussing ideas and beliefs with children because they are generally more honest than adults. They also have not devel - oped the exquisite levels of self-deceit and verbal sparring that can cover up true core personality issues. I had hoped that my one con - versation with Jessica would jiggle or dislodge the limited belief that being a millionaire has bad ramifications. The problem with Jessica is quite simple. She had already associated a negative emo - tion, represented by the word \"snob\" with the concept of being a millionaire. Our emotions drive us in one direction or another . Let's face it ... if a ten-year-old is already consciously choosing NOT to be a millionaire, what is the only destiny that is left for her? She will be firmly middle class (or worse) and overlook every opportunity that comes her way to earn big money. I was teasing her when I said she was choosing to be poor the rest of her life. Clearly that was not her intent. But by not choosing a path to wealth, you are taking the other road which leads to non-wealth. Financial prosperity is not an accident. It is a decision followed by choices followed by specific actions. Y ou see, this conversation would not have been as much fun with an adult, because adults have better stories and better argu - ments. Jessica is just a ten-year-old with a few untested opinions in her mind. One afternoon spent with a kind, non-snob millionaire and Jessica's mind will be changed. However, you are already grown. Y ou have a history and an ego to protect. Even if you had a chance to meet 100 millionaires that were kind and not snobs, you might have 200 more references in your past that that much money is either bad or simply not possible for you to attain. Y ou might simply decide that the 100 non-snob millionaires you met were exceptions. It all depends on how deep your beliefs are set. Because you are reading this book, I will assume you are willing to dislodge and change the beliefs that aren’t working for you. This will be a logical choice once you realize what a profound impact your beliefs 34 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"that belief could have led to over time. Beliefs are like very strong blinders on a horse. They automatically filter thoughts, opportuni - ties, and ideas that are not in alignment with that belief. Since your mind can only take in about seven bits of information at one time, your beliefs help you delete all the other information. Therefore, core beliefs tend to focus our mind on specific outcomes while avoiding alternative outcomes. This is extremely obvious if you run the core beliefs for twenty years starting at childhood. So, grab a pen and see if you can match the core childhood belief with the per - son the child grew to become twenty years later. Simply draw a line between the two columns.

Recently, a 27-year-old woman was cleaning my house. While she was taking a break, I turned the TV off of the talk show ( Jer r y Springe r) and turned to a show on personal finances. There was a famous author talking about wealth, buying a house, and how to pay less in taxes. I thought this is useful for the cleaning girl with two kids to watch. I knew she didn't make very much money, so this advice could make a big difference. She ignored the TV and picked up a hair magazine. I asked her, \"Doesn’t this interest you?\" She replied, \"Oh, that’s for people who have money, who are rich. This doesn’t apply to me. I’ll never have a house of my own.\" I thought, W ow, how sad. And, because she believes that, she will be right. Her beliefs are so corrupted she actually \"turns away from\" opportunities that could lead her to wealth. I had already looked at her handwriting before I hired her. So, I knew she had a low self- esteem and average intelligence. But no great personality trait could compensate for such a misinformed belief system. Because she so firmly believes she will never have money or own a house (unless she marries a rich man), she fails to set any goals. Good beliefs can attract and magnetize any worthy goal to you effortlessly. Likewise, a limiting belief can actually blind you from seeing opportunity that is standing in your path.

My mission for writing this book is to show you a simple, easy- to-follow map to living a life of wealth and happiness. The belief you must accept is \"your thoughts create your reality.\" Once you accept that premise, we can start choosing our thoughts, beliefs, val - ues, and events in our life from a position of choice and power .

He offered to talk to me about produc - ing a 30-minute long TV commercial to sell me in the form of a video home study course. At the time, the term \"infomercial\" was new and cable air-time was cheap. Many millionaires were born as a result of those early infomercials. W ell, I never called the guy to discuss it. I remember looking at his number and choosing not to call. I want to kick myself when I think about that today . The only reason I can justify my decision to \"miss that opportu - nity\" was a limiting belief system. I just didn't have the confidence to go for it at age nineteen. I waited almost ten years to attract another person into my life who had the ability to promote me in the form of an infomercial.

As you grew up, you formed an emotional attachment to certain people, emotions, and things. Things that made you happy were good. Things that made you unhappy were bad. If a puppy licked you on the face, then all puppies were good. If a puppy growled and bit you, then all puppies were bad. Thus your learning process really grew out of what was pleasurable and what was not so pleasurable. Y our brain made con - nections and chose beliefs that you are not even aware of. A firm belief can be formed two ways. It can be formed quickly by one very intense emotional experience of pain or pleasure. Example: A ten-year-old girl nearly drowns in the lake and watches her younger sister actually drown. Result: A set of beliefs relating to water: I can't swim. W ater kills. I hate the water . W ater scares me. And perhaps some other non-water related beliefs regarding death; \"Life isn't fair . There is no God. Or perhaps she’ll have a more posi - tive slant like \"I was saved by God because I am special.\" In any case, a strong emotional event can quickly establish a lifelong belief or an unconscious emotional response (fear, phobia, anger, joy, sad - ness, etc.) But it often takes more than one event to form a firm belief. It may take four or five pieces of evidence to form a belief. T ake a simple example of a child named Samantha on her first day of school. The teacher asks, \"Who knows the name of the presi - dent of the United States?\" Samantha proudly answers the question 43 Chapter 3 -The Secret Power of Beliefs Love is _______________________.

Money is _________________________________________ 42 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The more \"references\" you have, the more pressure the belief can handle and not buckle under the pressure. One way to change a belief is to provide many references to de- stabilize the current belief. However, if you are starting with a \"Stubborn Belief\" you might have an uphill battle breaking each metaphoric leg of each past experience or reference. In my experi - ence helping people change their beliefs, I often took them into the past using time-line therapy. Instead of fighting the merits of each experience, I found that if I could take the client back to the very first experience and alter the decision they made during that experi - ence, the other experiences just collapsed. They fell like dominoes. The Stubborn Belief became unstable like a barstool with only one leg. It just toppled. When it toppled, I picked a new, more useful belief and \"looked for\" new references and experiences so those would soon be accepted as truth. T WO K INDS OF B ELIEFS There are basically two kinds of beliefs. The first belief is what I call a \"CORE BELIEF\". (Some books call this a global belief.) This is a belief that makes a broad statement about the nature of something. Usually core beliefs are expressed in our language after 45 Chapter 3 -The Secret Power of Beliefs correctly . The teacher says, \"Very good Samantha. Y ou are so smart.\" Boom. One strong emotional experience has created one \"association\" with the word smart. Then a few weeks later she makes an \"A\" on a test. Another emotional \"association\" is created. Then her father tells her how \"smart\" she is. Etc. Etc. In this case, this little girl hears that she is smart over 24 times during the next six months. A core belief is established. Then, something interesting happens. She is watching baseball with some boys. All the boys scream with delight at the action on the field. She turns to the boy next to her and says, \"What hap - pened? Did they score a touchdown?\" The boy looks at her and says \"Wow . Y ou're stupid. T ouchdowns are only in football, not baseball.\" One negative. 20 positives. What is her belief about her - self? She might have her feelings hurt, but it is likely her brain says to herself, \"No, I'm not stupid. I'm smart. And you’re just a mean kid.\" Life goes on. The more emotionally laden evidence you can provide, the stronger that belief is against criticism. Now, imagine a little boy named Billy has just the opposite type of event occur in his life. Billy missed the question the first day of class. A student calls him lazy. One teacher even suggests he join the remedial class for slow students. His parents call him stupid. Etc. etc. Then, one day at a different baseball game Billy meets Samantha. Billy explains all the rules about the game of baseball. Samantha is so impressed at Billy's intelligence she says to him, \"Billy, you are the smartest boy I know!\" And kisses him on the cheek. W ow. Billy gets one extremely emotional positive affirmation that he is smart. The result is Billy will probably fall in love with Samantha. However, it is unlikely her one comment will de-stabi - lize the \"stupid\" belief that Billy now holds as truth. Think of beliefs like this. Beliefs are like the top of a stool. The more \"legs\" you have, the more stable the stool will be to sit on. 44 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Diagram 3A:Belief Stools W eak Belief Firm Belief Stubborn Belief"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"changing the rules you have can dramatically increase the quality of your life. But, just to tease you, answer this: What does it take for you to be happy? What must happen for you to be successful? What must happen for you to feel rich? The answer to the above questions will give you insight into both your current beliefs and your rules for being happy, successful, and rich. So, are you happy with the rules of the game? If you are making the rules, make them so you can win. Heck, if you can choose your beliefs (and you did) and a rule is just a type of belief (and they are) ... what is stopping you from changing the rules so you can feel happy all the time? Here is a secret. Shhh. Come closer . Y ou don't want everybody to hear this. You can change your own rules. So, what are the belief systems of the rich and happy? On this page I have listed some of the most common beliefs of people who change the world, make a difference, contribute to humanity, have great family, love their spouse, earn millions, and even wake up every day and go to bed every day in a state of happiness. 47 Chapter 3 -The Secret Power of Beliefs the words IS, AM, ARE. For example: Life is ______. People are ______. I am _________. Naturally, these can be associated with any context: Love, family, money, career, church, sports, society , gender, geography, etc. Core beliefs are a bit more difficult to change, because they seem to be true - despite your awareness that all beliefs are merely a result of your limited and myopic experiences as one person in just one body . Here are some examples of some very limiting core beliefs: I'm too young. I don't have the education. I don't have enough money . I'm not smart enough. Men are pigs. Marriage is a bad investment. All teenagers are trouble. Muslims are terrorists. Christians are dan - gerous. Americans are obnoxious. I’m fat. I’m broke. Life is hard. Money is hard to come by. People are selfish. Life is a bitch and then you marry one. All politicians are liars. Rock-n-roll is evil. Accepting any of the above statements as a belief instantly shuts down your ability to interact or learn anything from the sub - ject of the belief. If you think money is evil, then imagine how immediately \"crippled\" your ability to deal effectively with money . If a man thought all women were evil, how \"glorious\" would his marriage to a woman really be? Doomed from the start. R ULES The second kind of belief is what I call a situational belief or a rule. Don't we all love rules? Y our life is full of rules, even if you think you are a rebel. Rule beliefs are any statement or thought that could be described as having an IF > THEN in the sentence. IF you loved me, THEN you would marry me. IF I am smart, THEN I will always get straight A's in school. IF I am educated, THEN I can be rich.

Y ou spent most of your free time sitting on the couch eating moonpies watching television re-runs and sports events. Hmmm. Which history would you choose? Now I admit that I have chosen two extreme opposites along the spectrum of contributing to society, but I have a point to make here.

But, they were very clear on one aspect of their mission. They knew why . G ET A B IG W HY The secret to learning HOW to do anything is to create a big enough why . Before I tell you how to set up your brain and your nervous sys - tem to automatically \"wire \" in a compelling WHY , please imagine taking this test. T HE $100 T EST This is one of my favorite demonstrations in a live seminar. I ask who would like to win $100 cash? Imagine you raised your hand and came up to the front of the room. Here are the rules of the game: Y ou must hold your arm and hand in front of your body, palm facing down, for 90 seconds without moving it. That is how you win the $100. Are you willing to play? Good. Ready? Hold out your arm and start the timer. 89 seconds. As the sec - onds tick away, imagine I then pull from my pocket a large cigarette lighter. I light the lighter and a 4-inch flame rises from the top of the tiny butane tank. I then start moving slowly toward your hand. W ith each inch I get closer, I ask, \"Are you sure you want the $100?\" 55 seconds to go. Remember you can move your hand at anytime. When you move your hand away, you forfeit the cash.

Most of these early decisions are made completely outside or our awareness. The class clown learned early on that being loud and funny brought him plea - sure. While, the shy girl sitting next to him learned that speaking her mind brought her embarrassment (pain). Etc. Etc. So, when you learn to analyze yourself and your friends' personality traits in chap - ter 6 and 7, please have empathy. Even the really dysfunctional per - sonality traits like dishonesty or temper are based on a child's innate need to avoid pain and move toward pleasure. Our brain actually makes new neuro-associations with each new experience. Biologically, a new neuro-pathway is actually created in your brain. In non-medical terms, this means that a new cellular \"road\" is formed to assist in having that specific thought or feeling. The more often you feel a specific emotion, the bigger and stronger that cellular road becomes. Eventually, that road becomes a habit. So, your hundreds of cellular roads are what make up your person - ality . Y our brain opts to take those big paved highways, because it is much easier than creating a new road across untamed land. However, in order to form new personality traits and create new habits, you must force your brain to build new cellular roads. Most of the exercises, including all the grapho-therapy based handwriting suggestions in chapter 7, are designed to \"build new cellular high - ways\" in your brain. When you do these, change can happen faster . Y our own perceptions of what equals pain and what equals pleasure are the driving forces behind your life. By the way, very few people have the exact same definition as someone else. For some people, giving public speeches represents positive emotions like acknowledgment, respect, and contribution. However, for most of the world, giving a speech sparks emotions such as humiliation, embarrassment, failure, etc. So, which one is real? They are both real to each person. One of the most important steps to discovering how to live in a 55 Chapter 4 - True Fulfillment & Effortless Motivation flame moves closer . The lighter now sits 12 inches under your open palm. 30 seconds to go. Y ou can feel the heat rising from the flame. The lighter now moves up toward your palm. The heat is now a focused beam of flame searing your tender flesh. 25 seconds. Y ou can handle the pain. It hurts, it hurts. 20 seconds. Sometime between 20 seconds and 19 seconds your brain decides the pain of the flame is greater than the pleasure of the $100 cash. Y ou move your hand. So, the secret to motivation is having a large enough why . What if you were going to win $1 million dollars? I would burn my hand for $1 million bucks, no hesitation. When your why gets compelling enough, you are willing to go through larger amounts of pain to accomplish your goals. P AIN VS . P LEASURE Y our life is motivated by a constant assessment of pain vs. plea - sur e . Y ou might not be aware of it at the conscious level, but almost every decision you make is designed to move you either away from pain or closer to pleasur e . When you understand this basic truth of the mammalian brain, your life is easy to direct. Think about a dog. How many times does a dog have to get shocked by an electric fence before he learns new boundaries? These boundaries are taught by the simple principles of pain or pleasure. He rolls over for a doggy bone repeatedly. (Pleasure) Almost all the personality traits or \"roadblocks\" to success you will learn about in chapter 7 were formed as a result of a painful experience early in life. Being embarrassed at age 6 could result in the fear of ridicule . Being told you were stupid at age 10 could result in a low self-esteem . Being alienated for being the smartest kid in the class could have resulted in the fear of success rather than in a strong sense of self-worth.

By understanding how much you value each emotion, you can then determine what has been stopping you. Y ou can also create an extremely compelling mission that works with your values. T ake this simple test: Which of these emotions do you value most? (Security, adven - ture, success, peace, fun, love, trust) No, you do not value them all the same. One pops out as being the most rewarding. And, one probably stands out as being the least important. T ake a moment and rank them in order of your prefer - ence. #1 being the most desired emotion and #7 being the least important emotion to feel. The above seven words are actually just labels to describe an emotional experience. Whether that label is #1 or #7 is really the amount of value you have assigned to this emotional experience. Y our brain has already assigned a V ALUE to almost every possible experience. The problem is, you don't know what value it has assigned. In many cases it assigned a value to some experience when you were seven years old. T oday, your brain still perceives that emotion as a #1 value, when in fact you want it to be #7. For instance, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. At the time, I associated marriage with emotional pain. Although my mom’s second marriage has been 20 years of love and bliss, when - ever I got into serious relationships, my brain still remembered the pain of the divorce. So even though I wanted love, I spent my twen - ties valuing freedom over marriage. Most people have conflicting values that make them feel stuck or pull them in two different directions: security vs. adventure, love vs. freedom. 57 Chapter 4 - True Fulfillment & Effortless Motivation 56 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy There is more to life than increasing it’s speed. —Mahatma Gandhi"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Have you ever heard the Machiavellian phrase that says, \"The ends justifies the means.\"?

There are probably hundreds of words you can think of that describe your emotional states. Let’s explore which of your values move you towar d pleasure. I encourage you to take a few minutes and really answer the following questions as completely as possible. First, answer them in your own words. If you get stuck, I have provided a list of common values a few pages away. Use your own words. They contain more emotional juice than words you choose from a list. Y ou can choose values that pertain to your whole life. Or you can be more specific and elicit your values about being in a rela - tionship. If you are really serious about making all areas of your life work, I suggest answering the question five times- once for each category; Life, Career, Relationship, Health and Family .

(Life, Career , Relationship, Health, Family, etc) What else is most important to me in ___________. (Same cate - gory as above) Now, this question will guide you to rank the value of each emotion from highest to lowest. What has been most important to you , _____________ or _____________? In order to get the proper values, you must be careful to choose the actual \"ends value\" and not the \"means value.\" I’ll explain. 58 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"order of highest rank to lowest rank. Here are some common moving away from values: Frustration, anger, depression, humiliation, embarrassment and physical pain. W HA T D ID Y OU L EARN ? Now, look at both of your lists in ranking order. Do you see any conflicts? Ideally, your \"moving away from\" values will push you toward your goals, and your \"moving toward \" values will pull you toward your goals. If you know a person's value, you can predict a person's direc - tion in life. Y our values are like the walls of a pinball machine. They \"bounce\" you from one direction to another. Some \"push\" you in a direction and others \"suck\" you into another direction. If all your values are \"pushing\" you back and forth, you might begin to feel like a pinball. Moving very fast, but not getting very far . Just as your goals can change, so can your values. If values are merely the ranking you give to the value of the emotional experi - ence, your values will change with your level of experience. Don't despair if you find a value conflict. Just be grateful it has come to your attention, and you can begin to change yourself so that success will come easier than before. E XAMPLE #1: If you are a 21-year old virgin, the value of \"sexual stimulation\" might be ranked #1. But, after that same person has been married for 20 years, the value of \"sexual stimulation\" might rank lower on the value scale than love, connection, commitment, etc. W e tend to change our value of something given the rarity or the abundance of that experience. 61 Chapter 4 - True Fulfillment & Effortless Motivation The above two questions elicited values that you are drawn towar d . These tend to be positive emotions that you want more of in your life. Remember the test I did with the $100 bill and lighter? Which one was a more quick and compelling motivator... the flame or the cash? (Pain or pleasure?) That's right. Pain tends to get our attention quicker . And most people will work harder to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. How urgent do you get to earn $200? Is the motivation more when you want to buy a new dress or when you have an eviction notice stapled to your door? Many people live in a state of drama and urgency because pain is the only motivational strategy that gets them to take action. Therefore, it is equally important to know what emotional states your brain is currently programmed to avoid at all costs. What we want most and also what we fear most shape our lives. Example: if you really want success, but you are programmed to avoid the pain of rejection, you will have trouble succeeding in a sales job. People struggle with value conflicts all the time and don't know why they feel torn or stuck. H OW T O E LICIT Y OUR “M OVING A WAY F ROM ” V ALUES So take a moment to answer this question.

Bob had a self-confessed fear of commitment. His girlfriend, Nancy, was getting impatient with his resistance to getting married. Upon eliciting Bob's values, it was clear why Bob had such a difficult time making the long-term pledge of his love. Bob's #1 T oward value was freedom . Bob's #2 T oward value was love . Bob's #1 Moving away from value was loneliness. Bob's #2 Moving away from value was being controlled . Y ou can imagine the inner struggles Bob was having. Bob des - perately wanted to avoid feeling the emotion of loneliness but was ranking freedom as the #1 positive value he thought he needed to feel in order to be happy. Once this ranking came to his awareness, he was able to work through why he felt being married was a sacri - fice to his freedom. When he realized that in order to keep his ver - sion of freedom he must sacrifice his love and feel lonely, he felt pulled in two different directions. From his past both freedom and love had been very deep and important, and he associated pleasure with it. So, with his new awareness of his values, Bob began to re- assess his rules about having freedom. When he began looking, he found the evidence. Bob had unconsciously adopted a rule that marriage = no free - dom. Hmm. Bad rule for Nancy. She had a belief that marriage = freedom (freedom to express, to be authentic, to be vulnerable, etc.) Bob began to look for married people who experience freedom and 62 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Some people die at twenty-five and aren’t buried until they are seventy-five. —Benjamin Franklin"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"N EW V ALUE R ANKING For example, here are the newly designed values from this 40- year-old: T oward Pleasure V alues A way From Pain V alues Love Being Bored Success Physical Pain Fun Loneliness Adventure Being controlled Freedom Risk Security Failing For this demonstration only, I re-arranged all six values. In your life, you don't have to keep any values you don't want to. In the above example, I would most likely suggest he put fear of failing at the very bottom of his list of twelve moving away from values and put new values such as \"being mediocre\" or \"feeling broke\" near the top of his moving away from values. Do you think he will find achieving success much easier now than before? Notice how his life will change. First, I didn't suggest he re- arrange his #1 life value of \"love\". His wife might not appreciate that. So, he kept Love as #1, but we moved \"loneliness\" from #2 down to #3 moving away . This slight change will make it okay to spend more time working and less time with his wife in order to be successful. (If that is okay with her.) Second, we moved \"fun and freedom\" down on the list so \"suc - cess\" could rank higher. He obviously had a habit of choosing the short term \"fun\" instead of working toward a long-term success. Fun is still in the top three, but now he has balance. 65 Chapter 4 - True Fulfillment & Effortless Motivation asked them how they did that. He began to look for evidence to dis - lodge his limiting beliefs regarding marriage and freedom. So, both people wanted love and freedom. But, they had differ - ent rules about how to achieve these states. Bob eventually decided that love was a more compelling and rewarding emotion than this old version of freedom. Then, he and Nancy discussed all the ways he could feel free within a committed relationship. Once Nancy agreed to those rules, Bob felt comfortable moving forward with the engagement.

Y ou don't have to make it #1, but if you work to earn money, then put that value at #1, #2, or #3. Why? Because you make decisions based on what you value most.

On a daily basis, being aware of the decisions you make is a good place to practice living within your chosen value structure. Now, I will share with you an easy and effective way to move values higher on your list. For this demonstration, let's use \"Money\" as the value you would like to move higher on your list. Many people see money as merely a means-value. They feel money is merely the means (the path) to a more important value found in the end. That's okay . They don’t particularly get much emotional satisfaction in earning money . They do it to get the other values. Other people experience a strong positive emotional charge when they earn money . These people feel money is an ends-value. Because of this emotional charge attached to money, they often have an easier time earning money . If you want yourself to experience a more positive emotional charge to money, all you have to do is associate the same positive emotions of your top three values with the act of making money . This mental conditioning will train your brain to feel the same good 67 Chapter 4 - True Fulfillment & Effortless Motivation Third, we moved \"freedom\" down to #5 so he has the choice to work for a company that pays him big money, if he so chooses. For many people that have \"freedom\" so high on the scale, they avoid any type of career or opportunity that compromises their freedom. He might choose to work a high paying corporate job for three years and earn four times the salary. He now has that option. Fourth, we moved \"security\" down to the bottom of the moving towards list. This would be a difficult transition if it was #1, but since it was #3...it could be accomplished. Now, the concept of \"security\" is less attractive and he is free to take more risk. Fifth, we adjusted the moving away from values so he isn't so fearful of risk or failure. This isn't the ideal value structure. It is just an example. I was tempted to include the value structures of self-made millionaires and other successful and/or happy people. But, out of respect for your individual mission, I will not do so. Y ou might be tempted to \"program\" their values with the assumption that will make you happy. Nope. Y ou have to choose your own value chain based on your own desired outcomes. I will give you hints throughout the book to which #1 or #2 values tend to make people the most happy . I will relay this piece of advice that I learned from Dr . T ad James many years ago when I was struggling financially .

All you have to do is begin seeing \"money\" using the same mental processes as you are currently seeing your #1 value. Y ou do this by eliciting your submodalities. Submo-what-alities? Submodalities is one of those big scientific words that took me awhile to fully under - stand and to grasp the level of significance they can play in effect - ing the quality of my life. Now that I do understand the incredible power of submodalities, I have more direct control over all my emotions and internal thoughts. Submodalities are the fastest method to re-ranking values and changing anyone’s emotions relat - ed to any past or future event. Submodalities are the various ways your brain forms memories and emotions (loud or soft, in color or black & white, bright or dim, big or small, moving or still, fuzzy or clear, textured or smooth, panoramic or bordered, rectangular or square, you see yourself in the memory vs. seeing the event through your own eyes, etc.) Submodalities exist in every thought, memory, or emotion you already have. If you were to close your eyes right now and imagine yourself eating last night’s dinner - that memory will have sub - modalities to it separate from other memories: you may see yourself at the table or see through your own eyes all the food on the table; you may hear voices of people you were talking to or music in the background; you may feel the chair you were sitting in or sensations in your stomach; you may even smell the food and taste it in your mouth as if you were eating it right now . Research shows that by simply shifting these submodalities, you can have a dramatic effect on the emotional charge of that memory. I encourage you to elicit the submodalities you currently have relating to your lover, your ex-lovers, your job, your daily 68 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy V isual location in space quantity of images distance crisp & clear/ fuzzy or blurry bordered/ panoramic color/ black & white moving / still speed shape size horizontal & vertical perspective see event through your own eyes (associated) see event from outside yourself watching event (dis-associated) 3D or flat brightness/ dullness foreground background contrast Kinesthetic temperature intensity pressure vibration expanding/ contracting spinning still/ moving (where to where) location inside body moisture/ dryness texture rhythm smell taste Auditory quantity of sounds/ sources distance/ location in space style: music/ noise/ voice rythm & cadence mono/ stereo / surround sound speed clarity & intelligibility pitch volume (loud, soft) echo /reverb tinniness bass/ treble See chapter 11 for mor e information on submodalities."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Bart: \"That's nice.

I feel blessed that from an early age I felt very few limitations as far as my future was con - cerned. As empowering as that belief is, it still took me many years to figure out what I wanted to do and how to do it. The first step is having the empowering belief. The next step is asking the right questions. If you ask the right question enough times, you will find the answer. I was on a mission to find out how to be what I truly wanted to be. So, in my early teenage years, I found myself voraciously read - ing autobiographies of famous men and women. I especially was intrigued with Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Leonardo da V inci. I found myself imagining what it must have been like to be these men. As I imagined what kind of men they were, I began to imagine their life through their eyes. I asked myself what habits or personality traits they must have had to accomplish great things. As I studied these men and dozens of other self-help books, certain traits came to light. Even as a fourteen-year-old, I realized that these were self-made men. They created their own legacy by being a cer - tain way . Ben Franklin taught the value of honesty and hard work. Edison was the poster child for persistence. Leonardo was not afraid of failure. I also noticed their lifestyles and habits. Ben Franklin was a strict vegetarian. He lived to be 89 years old in an era when most men didn't live past 40. Hmm. That was clue to the value of 77"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"about, and many traits I was not proud of.

W as he just saying all this stuff because he knows me? Or , could handwriting analysis really reveal all that just from one para - graph? My dad had recently met a man named Dr. Ray W alker . Dad had started attending weekly classes to learn this 100-year-old science called handwriting analysis. And, it seemed to be the real deal. Knowing my prove-it-to-me attitude, my dad offered me a challenge. He said to me, \"Take this textbook with you this week to summer camp. Get handwriting samples from at least ten different kids and adults. Go back to your bunk and just compare their writ - ing to the handwriting samples in the trait dictionary at the back of the book. If you get a match, write down the trait. If it doesn't match, ignore it. Show your list to the author of the writing. They will tell you if it is true or not. Then, you be the judge if this stuf f works or not.\" T o make a long story short, I ended up analyzing over thirty samples that week. I even stood up on stage and did a handwriting analysis of the Camp Director. I told everyone that he was sarcastic and unorganized. They laughed and gave me a standing ovation. Not only did I have fun at the camp, but also I made more friends than every before. I had the cutest girlfriend and even received a trophy for best camper! W ow . What a gift my father gave me. I learned a few very important lessons that week. 1. Handwriting Analysis really works. 2. People behave the way they do because of their fears, desires, and personality traits. I learned empathy. 3. Handwriting Analysis can get me a lot of positive atten - tion and popularity. 4. If a fourteen-year -old can do it, anyone can learn it. When I returned home to Dallas the next week, I enrolled into Dr . W alker's Handwriting Analysis Certification Course.

Ben did reveal to me the strategy of saving a percentage of every coin earned. Etc. Etc. So, I too was convinced that if I could \"model\" successful men, I too could become a success. However, it wasn't easy to get a clear \"map\" of their thoughts and strategies. It was especially difficult because I lived in a different century than they did. The 1930's book called Think and Grow Rich gave a good road map to the mindset of success. The author, Napoleon Hill, inter - viewed dozens of rich men near the turn of the century. His work was revolutionary at the time. But, in a nutshell, he told me to \"Think and Grow Rich.\" Okay. Got it. Now what? It is my inten - tion, in this book, to give you actual mental \"tools\" which show you exactly \"how to think\" in order to be successful. One thing was clear to me at an early age. My success wasn't simply a matter of what I accomplished. My primary focus was on who I needed to become. I intuitively knew that, when I became the kind of man I wanted to be, success would follow as a natural law . So I focused on changing myself and expected the world to change with me. It did.

My t-bars are still crossed at the top of the stem. And the strokes of stubbornness, self-consciousness, and over-sensitivity to criticism have been gone for over a decade. The real test was what I found in the results. The first thing I noticed was my tendency to think more of myself. I wasn't a student who actually liked to study. However, I found myself walking into the school counselor's office one day requesting I be moved to a \"more challenging\" English class. I was bored. Then, I found myself ask - ing the prettiest girl in school out on a date. She said, \"No.\" But since I had begun to erase the fear of failure, I just asked out some - one else. It didn't take long to develop some better rapport skills and the girls started saying, \"Yes.\" I even noticed my grades were improving. I clearly remember the day I knew \"Grapho-therapy\" had worked for me. I realized it when I made an \"F\" on my first English paper . What? That's right. It was a horrible paper. In fact, my teacher actually suggested I go back to the \"non-advanced\" class, because it was unlikely I was ever going to excel at writing. Hmmm. I would say my defiance was a useful trait during that con - versation. I re-wrote that \"F\" paper and turned it into a \"C-.\" It was - n't the teacher's false opinion.

I was sitting at an Anthony Robbins seminar in 1989, when he began to discuss how our brains learn information. He said that learning is really a function of our brains establishing new \"neuro-pathways.\" Each time we have the same \"experience\" a spark of electricity moves along the neuro-pathways thus making the pathway twice as strong. If you have the emotion or experience 100 times, the brain creates 100 micro-strands along that neuro- pathway . This is how we establish habits. Now, if you have studied any brain biology, you realize this is a simplified metaphor for the complex neural-cortex. However, it is an accurate big picture description. Anthony Robbins referenced a study at UC Davis using macaque monkeys to establish a connec - tion between repeated physical movement and cellular development. Upon researching this study at UC Davis, I discovered that Dr . Amaral has been the man instrumental in this research. On the web - site, Dr . Amaral states that \"our research program is divided into three major efforts that use neuroanatomical, behavioral, electro - physiological and clinical studies to investigate: (1) organization of memory systems in the mammalian brain, (2) the organization of brain regions that contribute to social behavior in the macaque mon - key, and (3) human neuroscience.\" The UC Davis M.I.N.D Institute (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopment Disorders) explains the various advances in brain research like this, \"Advances in imaging technology are enabling researchers to unravel the complexity of brain function.

Monkeys and other nonhuman primates have brains organized comparable to humans, making them ideal research models for the study of neuro-develop - mental disorders.\" What I found revolutionary about the research is this: Repeatedly moving a macaque monkey's fingers in a slightly differ - ent motion path creates a totally new and separate neuro-pathway . A separate neuro-pathway means you have a totally new and different thought or experience. (You are literally building a habit at the cel - lular level.) The MRI can reveal this exact pathway each and every time the movement occurs. Then, when the scientist forced the monkey to move the same finger in a slightly different motion (as little as a centimeter different), the MRI revealed an entirely new neuro-pathway was forming. According to Mr. Robbins, they did this experiment by taping up the other fingers on the monkey's hand and giving him an MRI. In plain English this means ... moving your fingers actually affects the brain at the cellular level. Now, please don't misread the above research. Neither Dr .

Upon taking inventory of your own character, you will then want to choose which traits to adopt as your own and which traits to eliminate from your personality . Personality is a non-specific science. The subset of psychology called Personality Theory is an attempt to categorize and label clus - ters of thoughts, habits, attitudes and behavior. It has been a suc - cessful scientific pursuit. Some scientists still argue as to the origin of personality. Some will claim your personality is purely genetic and you have little control over your introversion, extroversion, or stubborn attitude. Other, more enlightened scientists realize there are hundreds of factors in determining a person's character. Most of the factors are a direct result of the \"nurturing\" or the environment you grew up in. The reason this argument is important is to point out that if you believe you are the way you are because of genetics or destiny, you have a very low chance of changing. However, if you believe that personality traits such as stubborn - ness, argumentativeness, self-consciousness are learned behaviors, then you will have an easy time unlearning them.

Upon closer examination of their life, they don't see those \"goals\" as par - ticularly risky. In fact, they function with all the elements of a low self-esteem (emotionally adverse to risk, defensiveness, fear of change, etc.) So, if you analyze other people's handwriting, you must be sensitive to their definition of \"high goals.\" A Zen Buddhist may have high t-bars and have aspirations for a happy marriage and a healthy garden this year .

Most people don’t know he is a Canadian who moved to Los Angeles when he was just eighteen years old with five dollars in his pocket and a dream. He lived over his aunt's garage and started going to auditions. He made it. He broke into Hollywood playing a conservative, Reagan loving Alex Keaton on the TV sitcom Family Ties . He went on to star in the blockbuster hit Back to the Futur e and many other hit movies. His most recent suc - cess was ABC's sitcom Spin City . In my view, the greatest success is his ability to maintain a loving marriage and family life among the challenges of a fickle Hollywood casting couch and a forgetful American viewing audience. He has succeeded, failed, and re- emerged a winner time and again. In the December of 1998, he received a lot of media attention because he has been silently living with Parkinson’s Disease for many years. I think his story is just another testimony to the power 107 Chapter 6 -Personality Success Secrets while performing. (Tennis, golf, negotiating, computer program - ming, speaking, etc.) However, self-esteem is really a \"cumulative rating\" of the various levels of confidence you feel in your entire life. Self-esteem is also tightly tied into the actual \"beliefs\" you hold about your own value and your own expectations. A confident baseball player could lead the league in home runs and still suffer a low self-esteem. This athlete has mastered the mental art of being confident. He feels confident by successfully controlling his internal images, voices, and feelings related to hitting a baseball. At the same time, some of his internal past wiring guides him to tolerate an unhappy relationship, turn to drugs, and lash out at those close to him. Confidence is contextual. Self-esteem expands across all con - texts of your life. When you raise your self-esteem, you will feel a higher level of confidence in all areas of your life. For example, if you come up to the plate to hit a baseball and you lack the confidence to know that you can hit it, here's what hap - pens. Instead of hearing that voice inside your mind saying, \"Bring it on you crummy little ball. I'm going to hit you out of the park!\" What often happens is the dominant thought is based in negativity or fear. So your internal voice might say, \"I'm going to strike out. I just know it.\" Now that thought actually predicts the future because it sends signals to your muscles to miss the baseball when it's thrown. Y ou can only visualize an event. Y ou can't visualize a non- event. If you lack confidence in any situation, then you put pictures in your mind of failing.

A bit of arrogance, too. I see a lot of rock musicians and movie stars with huge signa - tures. Some are illegible. I'm fairly confident the \"illegibility\" issue tends to be a result of signing their name in a hurry, frequently, and while walking in a crowd. Speed equals sloppiness. Often, when you see very big, bold strokes of hand - writing or when a signature is much larger than the rest of the writing, that is a sense of pride and ego, saying, \"Hey! I’m worth it. Give me the spotlight.\" But I tend to think that one of the rea - sons a musician works so hard to become famous is the need for \"recognition.\" A large ego has spe - cial needs.

P ERSISTENCE Strokes that double back over the letter and end toward the right indicate persistence. This trait is usually located in the \"t\" and \"f.\" This person has the quality of not giving up when confronted with temporary setbacks. He will persist until he completes the task. When you see this in someone's handwriting, realize they are very powerful people who tend to hit the wall and then break through it with great triumph and success. The only downside is they often stay on the same path too long when they realize there could have been another path with less resistance. Persistence is shown by a double-crossed t-bar, much like a star . If you think about drawing the star on the side of the Dallas Cowboy's helmet, you go down, up to the left, never pick up your pen, and back to the right. One metaphor for remembering this trait is someone hitting difficulty head on, going back into the past eval - uating what works and what doesn’t, and then coming back toward the issue head on. Of course, all the while never picking up the pen. Ben Affleck’s signature shows persis - tence in the letter “A”, not in the t.

I think they all work together . The three traits that reveal various aspects of determination are: enthusiasm, persistence, and determi - nation. W e have already discussed persistence. Enthusiasm is shown by a very long stroke, often in the cross - ing of the letter \"t.\" If the t-bar is extra long, it means lots of enthu - siasm. Y ou ought to notice that the opposite of enthusiasm is a very short t-bar, perhaps on the left side of the stem, and that would be someone who procrastinates. Obviously if you procrastinate exces - sively you may never get around to achieving your goals. The third trait is determination. Again these all sound similar , and they are distinctly different in the handwriting. If you combine them all together you get a massively powerful result. Determination is more of a physical drive rather than simply setting your mind on something and achieving it, like persistence. Persistence tends to focus on local goals and long-term goals. Drive is an addition of strong energy. If you have a strong drive, you might get up at 5:30 in the morning and go home at midnight in your work. Y ou could do that for weeks on end. Y ou often see drive even in letters like \"y\" and \"g\" that have complete loops, but the down stroke is very heavy -- a lot heavier than the upstroke. What you look for is any down stroke that is substantially heavier or even longer than other handwriting samples or other strokes. I often see it in the letters \"t\" or \"m\" which is an unusual way to end a letter . Superstar athletes tend to have a strong determination.

It is revealed in extra long horizontal strokes anywhere in the writing. The most common location to spot enthusiasm is in the cross bar of the letter \"t\". Martin Luther King has an abundance of enthusiasm and ambition. Making the cross in your t-bar long is always a posi - tive personality improvement. In addition to the long t-bars, Dr . King has lots of pride and dignity . A long t-bar indicates enthusiasm as shown in Martin Luther King’s signature. Enthusiasm is one common trait of great leaders. Also people whose handwriting have very short t-stems tend to start projects and not finish them. Which of course would be a lack of enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the enduring emotion of excitement. (Some men with ... you know, a short endurance sexual problem ... have t-stems that are just a dash - no lasting energy.) Similar to enthusiasm would be traits like determination and persistence, although a little different in behavior . They are very useful traits, and when they're all tied in together, you have someone who’s very powerful and usually achieves what they desire. S TRONG P HYSICAL D RIVES / B IG S EX D RIVES Some people may disagree with this success trait. I have noticed a strong correlation between high achievers and big sex drives. This does not mean that in order to make money you have to have lots of sex. (Although there might be a correlation to how much money you have to how many sexual offers you get!) What it does mean is 118 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"the negative term gullible is used to describe someone who allows too much information in without effective discernment. In handwrit - ing analysis, we see one clue to the amount of imagination one has by the width of the loops. If the d-loop is wide, we see the person has an unrealistic imagination relating to people's criticism. (Not healthy). In the h-loop, a big loop reveals a tendency to be open and investigative about philosophical and religious concepts. If the loop of the lower case cursive \"e\" is large, the person is called broad - minded. The most common location for a healthy imagination is the size and width of the lower loops in the \"j,\" \"g,\" and \"y.\" This is often combined with an assessment about someone's sex drive or sexual imagination. But, imagination can clearly exist exclusive from any sexual connotation. Imagination is the width of the loop. Physical drive is the heaviness and the depth of the downstroke in these letters. Many handwriting samples contain both elements. Thus, it is easy to confuse a healthy imagination for an adventurous sex drive. In general, a healthy size y-loop is a positive thing. Refer to the y-chart in chapter 5 for more information on the letter y . I NTEGRITY /H ONESTY One indicator of honesty is found in the lower case letter \"o.\" The way the lower case \"o\" is formed indicates traits such as blunt - ness, secrecy, self-deceit, and lying. Although true criminals and thieves may have other more devious handwriting traits not revealed in the letter \"o,\" you will find the letter \"o\" a valuable asset in searching for someone's level of integrity and honesty . There are many ways to make a lower case \"o\": the less inner loops, hooks or squigglies inside the oval increase the person's propensity to be can - did, blunt, and truthful. So, look for the letter “a” and “o” with no inner loops or only small inner loops on the right side. The cleaner the inside of the a and o is.. the more blunt and candid the person tends to be. 121 Chapter 6 -Personality Success Secrets I am different from Washington; I have a higher, grander standard of principle.

D ESIRE FOR R ESPONSIBILITY People who have a need to be responsible tend to gravitate toward leadership roles and get their sense of significance from con - tributing to the good of a team. This personality trait is revealed in a signature or a capital letter in the form of large loops at the begin - ning or ending of strokes. The larger this hook the more the person desires to be responsible or in the spotlight. This trait sounds like it is a desire for attention, but it is less self-serving. I also coined the term \"desire for fame\" which is the same stroke on a large signature. The reason I associate fame with this stroke is because of the shear number of famous people I have noticed that use this stroke compared to the rest of the population. It seems that a large signature and this hook stroke are common among famous musicians, actors, and celebrities. This same stroke is also found without the big ego in civic leaders, organizational presidents and volunteer leaders. This stroke indicates a deep need to win the love, affection, or respect of a group. D EPTH OF F EELING OR E MOTIONAL I NTENSITY IN H ANDWRITING 123 Chapter 6 -Personality Success Secrets Interviews with millionaires have stated that \"honesty\" is the most important element to their success. Honesty builds trust and is essential in maintaining long-term relationships. Research indicates 98% of millionaires have a supportive spouse and have been mar - ried for over ten years. From a spiritual perspective, all the great philosophies have preached the value of honesty and integrity as having its own rewards in this lifetime and after this lifetime. From a linguistic perspective, the question of the honesty of your \"word\" is very significant. Y our unconscious mind is constant - ly receiving programming from your own internal voices. The con - sistency of your spoken word dramatically affects your ability to successfully program your unconscious to assist you in manifesting your goals and dreams. If you have a habit of not keeping your word to others, your unconscious mind knows this and then lowers its own commitment to follow your own orders and requests. In essence, your unconscious stops believing what you say . Therefore, it stops working for you as effectively. If you lie to others, you will lie to yourself. If you lie, you are sabotaging your future. Integrity and honesty in handwriting are characteristics that are not easily spotted in any single letter. Entire books have been writ - ten on this one element of personality and how to spot it in hand - writing. It takes an advanced eye to know all the subtle clues. The letter \"o\" will give you a good head start and assist you in noticing any red flags. Read the following chapter for more information about the letter “o” and how it relates to dishonesty .

The secret is determining how to control which emotions you feel on a regular basis. T est yourself: If your hand hurts from pressing too hard on the pen and paper, you are a heavy writer. If a copy machine has trouble seeing your pen marks because you write so light, you are a light writer. For example, if you have strong emotional depth, and some - one angers you to the point of revenge or hatred, you will still hate that person many years later. Likewise, if you fall in love with someone you’ll probably still feel deep feelings many years later . Even if the relationship has long ended. In some cases, as you know, the deep feelings are just as intense, but we label them differ - ently after an ugly breakup. If you have lots of break ups in your love life, you will handle it much better if you are a light writer . In your case you have to look at your own handwriting, evalu - ate your own personality, and decide which traits you have now that support your success in a positive, ethical way, and which traits do not. If you do not have heavy handwriting, it doesn't mean you have to put it in there to be successful. If you do want to add this intensi - ty to your life, please make this addition only after you look at all other aspects of your personality. Remember, you are just intensify - ing what you’ve got. So make sure you have changed anything neg - ative or bad or you’re turning up the heat on the ugly part as well as the wonderful part. D IPLOMACY The ability to get along with people is essential to both financial and interpersonal success. The ability to gain rapport with people quickly will be discussed later in this book. One element of rapport is the ability to choose your words carefully in a way not to offend anyone. W e call this way with words: diplomacy. Diplomacy is revealed by a noticeable decrease in the height of the second hump compared to the first hump of an \"m\" or \"n.\" If the humps go 125 Chapter 6 -Personality Success Secrets Depth of pen pressure is a handwriting trait I have found in a majority of self-made millionaires. I wouldn't suggest you change your own level of pen pressure, but I felt obligated to mention it as a spur to achievement. Pen pressure is easy to notice if you just run your finger lightly across the backside of a sample of handwriting. I just flip the paper over and feel if the pen made an impression on the backside. The harder you press on the paper, the deeper your emotions run. The more intensity - the more depth of feeling. One descriptive metaphor is \"You may forgive but never forget.\" One good aspect of someone who writes lightly is that they get over angry situations much faster. Light writers never brood as long as heavy writers. Now, interestingly enough, deep enduring emotions are not always a positive element. In fact, most traits are not judged good or bad viewed separately. But, when you combine the many traits together they have a dynamic result. Y ou would probably agree that persistence, enthusiasm, and determination are wonderful personali - ty traits. Of course, like anything ... those traits could become a detriment if in the character of someone evil. Emotional intensity, determination and persistence would not be good for society if it was part of a psychological profile od a homi - cidal maniac. That desire to \"kill\" would then be supported by a deep burning emotion, determination and the tendency to try again and again to satisfy his dark desires. If you ever get a chance to view an actual serial killer's handwriting, you might be surprised what you would see. (Always heavy handwriting.) What I find in most successful self-made millionaires is that they get an urge to achieve something, and it drives them. It obsess - es them. They think about it day and night. An accurate indicator of this trait is heavy pen pressure. So, do you think emotional intensity is a benefit or detriment for the state of happiness?

I have not found downward humps in a majority of rich and happy people's hand - writing. However, I believe it would add to your repertoire. As a side benefit of programming diplomacy, you will be de-program - ming the fear of ridicule. Nice side effect. F LEXIBILITY It has been said the person with the most flexibility wins. This is obviously true in the physical manifestations of conflict such as the martial arts. T ai Chi and Hop Ki Do teach the student to move with the attacker ’ s energy and simply re-direct it. They teach the metaphor that wood breaks, water bends. Whether you are pursuing a goal or having a discussion with your spouse, the ability to change on the fly is essential. Flexibility is the tendency to have many options to succeed. In handwriting analysis, the lack of rigidity in the baseline reveals flexibility. On the other hand, excessive control is revealed when someone writes a sentence that appears to have been typed by a typewriter (each line is exact and perfect, the baseline could have been drawn on a ruler). The term \"anal-retentive\" comes to mind when I see pretty, precisely spaced, copy-book style, totally bal - anced writing. This tells me the person follows all the rules way Basketball player Michael Jordon is still a worldwide celebrity years after his own retirement from sports. Part of the reason is his kind and diplomatic demeaner . Notice the difference between these two handwriting samples. The bouncy baseline and lack of structure translates into a mor e free spirited flexible personality with less “rules.” The top hand - writing sample is someone who can handle unexpected events with ease. He also tends to be more sloppy and have less discipline.. The person below writes similar to what people are taught as chil - dren. This “copy book” style has a perfectly straight baseline and even spacing. He expects people and events to follow a prescribed set of rules. In fact, when things don’t go according to plan, this kind and simple person can go temperamental. (especially with a low self-esteem). Tight and perfect handwriting sometimes indicates some form of neurosis or at least an anal retentive “uptight” quali - ty. This person is not very flexible when things go haywire. There is no better or worse style. Each type of baseline and structure has its strengths. Thomas Edison and John Glenn’s writing have perfec - tionistic even baseline qualities. How many rules do you follow?"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"too closely. If they follow rules, they demand other's to follow their own rules, too. When you set up rigid rules, you experience fre - quent frustration when those rules are not followed. Naturally, there will be anal-retentive neurotic people who can achieve wealth and happiness. If I were flying a spaceship that required zero mistakes (John Glenn) I would want an anal retentive controlled personality. However, these people don't have the happy- go-lucky, change-paths-on-a-dime attitude that makes being around them fun and easy. Because I have a bouncy baseline, I don’t want other people’s rules imposed on me. I have a tendency to want these people with too straight of a baseline to just loosen up. I’ve never seen anyone try to change their own baseline. (I have seen other people’s baseline and overall slant or spacing change dramati - cally as a result of taking prescription medication such as Prozac or Paxil. Isn’t it interesting that the handwriting reflects the personali - ty shifts when a drug intervention is effective? Those drugs are often prescribed for either obessive compulsive disorder or depres - sion. I tend to suggest taking a middle of the road approach. Not too perfect, not too sloppy! I NTELLIGENCE Many people have very limited belief systems about their own level of intelligence. In the past thirty years, there have been many intelligence tests that have come and gone as far as validity. Even handwriting analysis has many subjective areas relating to judging intelligence. There is not just one, easy-to-identify handwriting stroke to spot intelligence. Therefore, instead of showing you geniuses handwriting and having you wonder if you stack up, I'm going to allow you to believe you are a genius. And, even if you never choose that belief, you will know it doesn't really matter .

For most of us, our performance in school was a major measurement device for establishing our own beliefs about our level of smarts. Book-smart people sometimes lack the common sense others seem to have so naturally . There seems to be a correlation with the level of \"emotional intelligence\" and happiness in life. The book Emotional Intelligence has forced many people to reevaluate their own definition of intelligence. Dr . Thomas J. Stanley's book The Millionaire Mind states that in a self-assessment of over 733 American millionaires, the success factor of \"High Intelligence / Superior Intellect\" was ranked just 21 out of 30 key important fac - tors of success. In fact, only 21% said it was very important and 47% said it was important. But, it fell considerably behind other more attainable qualities such as honesty, hard work, and discipline. Dr . Thomas J. Stanley’s book The Millionaire Mind revealed some interesting statiscal facts about millionaire’s and their thinking processes. One of the questionairres asked participants which per - sonality traits were most imortant in being successful. The #1 response was honesty and discipline. Y ou can read for yourself how someof America’s millionaires judged their own success factors. Intelligence is not found in just one stroke of the pen. It is a combination of many various strokes in various letters. Because of the advanced nature of this trait, intelligence in handwriting will not be discussed in detail.

I NTUITION T ruthfully, intuition is also a sign of intelligence and a lot of people are not familiar with the concept of intuition as a part of intelligence. But remember, intelligence is processing information and coming up with a good decision. Intuition is a 6th sense. It's taking information from your gut feeling. Research indicates that people who do follow their gut feeling, in addition to well- researched advice, often make better decision makers. In fact, after interviews with some top executives, many of their best hiring decisions are made \"going by their gut.\" Intuition is shown in handwriting by frequent lifts of the pen, rather than solid connected handwriting.

At the same time, I don't want to have a signature too large. I don’t need my ego to get any bigger . P RIDE & D IGNITY Pride & dignity are revealed by tall narrow \"t\" or \"d\" stems. As a grapho-therapist, I don't recommend people intentionally make their t-stems taller. If a stem is 4 times the size of the middle zone writing, the writer is often arrogant. This excessive pride and unnec - essary concern about the opinions of \"society\" (What will they think?) is usually excess baggage on the trip to the top. So, I feel programming pride via handwriting changes carries the risk of acci - dentally programming vanity . Therefore, limit yourself to removing the loop in a \"d\" or \"t\" stem, but keep them in between 2-3 times the height of the surrounding lower case letters. By the way, as you start to raise your t-bar, you might find the t-stem growing taller . Stop it. A void letting your t-stems grow too tall. A CQUISITIVENESS The desire to acquire is a trait that will accelerate someone's tendency to accumulate physical stuff. This may include money , cars, and shoes. Depending on your philosophy in life, this might be a positive trait or a negative one. Feng Shui experts say keeping too much stuff around the house compromises the flow of the chi. Therefore, acquiring too much stuff can stiffen your ability to earn more. I can't say this trait will increase the odds of you becoming rich and happy. I do know this fact. Acquisitiveness is a handwriting trait that I often see in people who have acquired lots of wealth. It is only a supportive trait. It indicates a burning need. When people have a burning need, they usually find a way to fill this need. Acquisitiveness is revealed by beginning hooks in the middle zone. When I see this in a woman's handwriting, I always tell them they have more shoes than they could ever wear. Most of them are 135 Chapter 6 -Personality Success Secrets 134 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Composer John Williams has many success traits.

I have found most people that consistently achieve simply take full responsibility for the outcome they get. If the outcome doesn't meet their expectations, they re-evaluate, create a new plan, and do it again. No worries. In the last chapter, I introduced to you many personality traits that increase the odds of experiencing success effortlessly. I even encouraged you to change your handwriting to adopt some of those handwriting strokes. Simply adding those traits to your handwriting is like adding nitro glycerin to your car. It will supercharge your engine and send you rocketing down whatever path you are already on. However, putting a turbo charged engine in a 1964 Ford Dart might not be a great strategy. I doubt the steering, tires and brakes are designed for that kind of speed. H OW DO YOU GET A L AND S PEED R ECORD ?

One man straps himself in and cheats death at a speed of 600+ miles per hour . Every few years someone else attempts to beat this record for a place in The Guinness Book of World Records . No matter how fast the car becomes, the driver must choose a track with miles and miles of flat, obstacle-free land. There is no 20 mile paved highway that is straight, flat, and empty of all other cars. So, the team races their cars across huge dried lakebeds in Nevada and Utah called the Great Salt Flats. The ground is smooth as silk. No obstacles are in the path that might slow the car down. Imagine the distress of click - ing on your turbo charger just before you come upon a broken down Chevy in your lane. Y ou must find an obstacle-free road. Y our path toward your goals is similar to these racers looking for a new record. In order to be successful, they must have a clear path free of roadblocks. In your life, you must take a look at the unconscious programming and remove the \"personality roadblocks\" that might be holding you back. Luckily, in the field of handwriting analysis, many of the most important personality roadblocks can be easily identified and changed through grapho-therapy . Grab a sample of your own handwriting and begin looking for areas of your internal programming that match the traits explained in this chapter . P LA Y ALONG WITH THIS GAME . Before we jump into explaining and eliminating roadblocks, please play along with this simple game. Imagine that you and I are standing in the middle of a basketball court in an empty gymnasi - um. As we are chatting about your life's purpose, you notice about twenty feet above your head is a shiny blue gift box with a bright yellow ribbon. Y ou ask me what that box is for.

If I got that box, someone would just steal it from me anyway . But, you are different. Y ou are determined to find a way to get what's inside that box? So, what's your solution? Did I hear some - one say, \"Get a ladder!\" A ladder. Now that's a great idea. Good suggestion. What the ladder really represents psy - chologically is that we need a plan.

W ell, most people might not even start because they might have a fear of falling, a fear of the ladder slip - ping, or they might be physically unfit to climb. Y ou are different. Y ou jump up onto the first step of the ladder with enthusiasm, but your foot doesn't take hold. Y ou look down and notice someone has placed a huge bag of cement on the first step. Y ou have hit your first roadblock. In life, deciding what you want and making a plan isn't enough. Y ou must have the flexibility to see the roadblocks, clear them, and start again. From a psychological angle, road - blocks are those habits, fears, or personali - ty traits that hold you back from accomplishing your goals. I will use the analogy of a big, black bag of rocks for each fear that holds you back. Whether you try to navigate around the bags or you pick it up and carry it with you, those bags of rocks will slow you down. There are nine key roadblocks that we will discuss in this sec - tion. If you will, imagine that for each of these per - sonality traits, a bag of cement has been placed on the ladder .

They don't get out because they imagine the pain of leaving (loneliness, financial hard - ship, physical threats, etc.) as being worse than suffering in the rela - tionship. If you find that half of your \"t-bars\" are crossed at the bottom and the other half at the top, this means that your self-image fluctu - ates with what you're doing. For instance, you might have a lot of confidence in certain areas, your job, but then personally you’ve got insecurities to deal with. Does it make sense? So you don't have to be 100% consistent. W e are humans not computers. Handwriting is really brain writing. It’s basically a projection of your neurology on paper. So if a trait is present only 20% of the time, it only occurs 20% of the time in your life. Handwriting can be very statistical. R yan W aton's parents purchased my workbook for kids when R yan was just 10 years old. This book Change Your Life in 30 Days for Kids was designed to effectively guide a child into erasing some of these personality roadblocks while programming the success traits. Ryan worked diligently for 30 days straight. I know he worked hard because he wrote me a letter telling me how much fun it was to complete the workbook. Like a good student, every t-bar was crossed at the top of the stem. Ryan told me that within weeks of starting the grapho-therapy, he began doing his homework with - out his mother forcing him to. His grades began to rise as a result of his improved habits and higher expectations. A year or so after that nice letter, Ryan's father called me to thank me. Apparently, as a 159 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success R OADBLOCK #1: F EAR OF F AILURE The fear of failure is revealed by the location of the cross bar on the lower case letter \"t\". This one handwriting stroke might be the most significant single stroke in the alphabet. This same stroke also reveals insight into someone's self- esteem, self-image, and confidence. A low t-bar is defined as a t-bar that is crossed inside the middle zone, not above that zone. The middle zone is defined by the typical height of all the single height letters such as \"a, o, e, i, n, m\" or the humps on such letters as \"h\". It would be easier to say the t-bar is below the halfway mark, but this wouldn't be accurate if someone made his stem 8 times as tall as normal. In the last chapter, you noticed most of the super successful men and women crossed their letter \"t\" near the top of the stem. Those who cross their \"t\" above the top of the middle zone are more practical, but still able to handle change well. In the ladder metaphor, someone with a fear of failure might imagine falling off the ladder or simply getting to the top and being unable to get the box. Because this fear is so real, people choose to stay in their current situation instead of taking any risks. Remember the pain vs. pleasure exercise in an earlier chapter? Y ou take action easily because the pain of taking action is so much less than the pain of not taking action. It amazes me how much dis - comfort people will tolerate in an effort to avoid failing.

But, you already know the reward for changing your t-bar is tremen - dous and the risk is minimal. Change it and be my next written testimonial. S ELF -E STEEM VS . C ONFIDENCE The next roadblock to success is low self-esteem / weak ego. This is very much the same discussion as the previous trait fear of change. So similar, handwriting analysis uses the same stroke to reveal it: A low t-bar. Because self-esteem is such a complex prob - lem, I feel I am oversimplifying it just spotting it in the t-bar. In fact, confidence can be labeled as an emotional \"state.\" Even people with terribly low self-esteems can experience states of confidence in sports, in school, or even with the opposite sex. Therefore, lumping these all together might be a bit of a generalization. Let me show you two other areas where we can get a clue to someone's overall ego strength and sense of confi - dence. The good news is that by raising the t-bar, all areas of self-esteem seem to be affected. The size of the personal pronoun \"I\" indicates your sense of ego and ego strength. The larger the capital \"I\", the less crap you tend to take from others. The smaller the personal pronoun \"I\", the more someone gets walked on or allows themselves to be treated poorly . The stand-alone capital \"I\" reveals a person's ego strength relative to the people in their world. In a similar vein, a person's signature reveals their ego in a more public venue. Because people are aware their signatures will be judged as an extension of themselves, people often \"doctor up\" their signatures trying to make some kind of state - ment. It is for this reason that I rarely rely on just a signature alone to make an accurate assessment about a celebrity. Our public persona is usually a bit different than our private persona. The size of your signature does reveal your ego strength. Contrary to popular opinion, ego strength is valuable to achieving 161 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success 160 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"an inflated ego. 3. Make the first letters of you signature a size that gets noticed. If you have aspirations of leadership, consider underlining your name (always end the stroke toward the right side of the page on an underline.) Naturally, the size of these first letters is in direct pro - portion to the size of your overall writing. As a guide, I recommend making your beginning letters of your signature about 3-4 times as tall as the size of your middle zone. F EAR OF S UCCESS W ith all this discussion of success, how could anyone actually fear it? This doesn't make any sense, does it? Why would anyone not want to rake in the rewards of succeeding? There are two rea - sons people might sabotage their own success or have a strong fear of succeeding. 1. This person links severe pain to the changes that will occur if they succeed. 2. This person links tremendous emotional pleasure to the act of failing or coming up short. Either model of their brain results in an unconscious effort to botch the best laid plans and self-sabotage their career or love life. People with fear of success get close to the finish line and then find an excuse not to cross it. Those of you who have it will be glued to every word in this section. Those of you who don't might be scratching your head as to how fear of success occurs. But, trust me, it is a very significant and common roadblock. This is the one \"hell trait\" that I will base a hiring decision upon without seeing the rest of the writing. If the \"y\" turns down, I turn down the application. This is not a trait that makes you a horrible employee. It makes you an unpredictable employee. When you get 163 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success success. Y ou might consider someone's ego as being bad and self- serving. I don't think that’s always true. I think that if the ego is too large, it begins to take over the spotlight for self-serving needs. But, likewise, an ego that is very tiny doesn't have the strength to draw a line in the sand and stand for what it believes in. One trait I do see in many leaders is an underline of their name. This is a bit of an explanation mark signifying our own importance. This doesn't bother me as a grapho-therapist. As long as we don't have arrogance, I think ego is a healthy function of a balanced per - son. G RAPHO - THERAPY SUGGESTIONS : If you can practice handwriting changes daily for at least thirty days, you will form a habit at the phsysiological level. This habit will serve you well for the rest of your life. 1. Cross your t-bar near the top of the stem on the lower case \"t\". (Exception. If you tend to cross the letter \"t\" using the t-cross - bar as an entry into the next letter, you can keep it in the middle. This \"connectedness\" is labeled fluidity of thinking. This is a posi - tive trait that supercedes the evidence of esteem in this letter.) 2. W rite the personal pronoun capital \"I\" with well-proportioned loops. And if it’s tiny, make it bigger. But not too big or you’ll have 162 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"men? Remember, successful and happy people take total responsi - bility for their own lives. If it happens once, take notice. If it hap - pens twice, it's a pattern. At some subconscious level, this bride wanted to fail. She wanted to sabotage her own success. I couldn’t 't imagine why until I heard her mother's response. After the second groom stood her up at the alter, her parents took her on an \"all expense paid trip to Europe.\" Her parents said, \"It's okay honey. Let's go to Europe. It will be all right. W e love you no matter what. A couple of first class tickets to France and a day at the Hotel Spa will heal your pain.\" They embarked on the trip, and my friend got rewarded with love and pleasure for screwing up her wedding. This is an example of how the rewards of failing can be more pleasurable than the rewards of succeeding. It is my opinion that many parents inadvertently reward their kids when they fail and set the seeds for the fear of success. The brain is constantly learning by linking pleasure and pain to different behaviors. This trait is a direct result of more pleasure (love, attention, connection, respect, com - fort, etc) to failing than succeeding. S UCCESS S T OR Y : J ENNY H A THA WAY In 1994, I was promoting seminars from my hometown in Dallas, T exas. My brother owned a small bookstore that specialized in self-improvement merchandise. W e received a resume from a lady named Jenny Hathaway who was moving to T exas from Boston. She made it very clear that she would like to work for the bookstore or my seminar company. Her resume was very impres - sive. She had great knowledge of all the various books, tapes, and self-improvement seminars. Plus, she was about as nice as anyone could be. I said, \"Fax me your handwriting.\" I don't do any hiring with - 165 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success ready for that promotion, something happens to sabotage it. It's not that you just decide, \"I don't want it.\" Sometimes something just happens. Magically somebody messes it up for you. Y ou have an accident. Y ou get sick. W ell unconsciously, it's sabotage. The fear of success trait shows up in the letter \"y\". If the last stroke heads up to the baseline and then turns away ... that’s the fear of success. Here’s a metaphor to make it really easy for you to memorize. Imagine the stroke of the letter \"y\" as the path of a racecar heading for the finish line. The finish line is the imaginary \"base - line\" in which each letter starts or stops at. If you don't actually write on lined paper, you might have to imagine where that line would be. If the car makes its turn at the bottom of the \"y\", it is driving on the home stretch going towards the finish line. Imagine that car sud - denly slams on the brakes and makes a u-turn to the right. Now, it didn't cross the finish line. That’s what the self-sabotage \"y\" does. If you have this trait, pay attention. Although it might not affect all areas of your life equally, it’ll affect some areas in very painful ways. Y OU WILL W ANT TO CHANGE THIS TRAIT . I met a girl who had this trait in every \"y\". She had been to the altar twice and the groom stood her up, both times. Now you could say, \"Bad choice in grooms.\" T rue. But why did she choose those 164 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"during that time of my life. In fact, the changes in her own personality were so pervasive, I wasn't the only one who noticed. W ithin a year of completing her handwriting changes, Deepak Chopra offered her a job with his seminar company. Jenny had been volunteering for many years at Deepak's events, but she was never part of the paid staff. But, once Jenny cleared her roadblocks, she manifested an ideal job with an ideal salary . W ithin the year, Jenny had packed up and hit the road managing Deepak Chopra's seminars worldwide. In fact, Jenny has been happily employed by Deepak's company for many years now. I am so happy for her. She is now living her dreams. She travels the world helping others transform their lives through spirituality . She told me, \"Bart, your advice is what changed my life. Before I changed my writing, I had never attracted this type of opportunity . And if they did come my way, I had always sabotaged them before they came to fruition.

H OW TO C HANGE E VEN F ASTER As you learned in a previous chapter there actually is a synaptic pathway that is formed with each thought. Handwriting is a visual representation of that thought process. What happens if you begin finishing the stroke on this \"y\"? Y ou create a new neuro pathway. If you do this every day, you end up creating a lot of neuro pathways. Y ou can even increase the growth of those little neuro pathways by adding emotion to this learning experience. Y ou add emotion by playing with your internal pictures, voices, or feelings. Y ou are welcome to doodle a page full of \"y's\" while you are 167 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success out looking at their handwriting. Absolutely not. I've been more strict about hiring based on handwriting than I have been about dat - ing! Jenny faxed me two pages of her penmanship. I was very impressed with 99% of what it revealed. She had enthusiasm, great self-esteem, unshakable integrity, energy, and a keen intellect. But she had the down turned \"y\". She had everything else going for her . She had everything I wanted in an employee, but that singe trait scares me. So I explained to her why I couldn't extend the invita - tion, \"Jenny, you have so many great qualities I look for. However , you have a trait that is a deal-breaker. I'm going to ask you about this and tell me if this is true. Do you have any self-sabotage or fear of success? I have found that people with the self-sabotage trait end up not working out for some reason. Something always happens. Does that ring a bell?\" She said contemplating my statement, \"Bart, that’s the strangest comment. In my personal life, I always finish what I start. But ... of the last three companies I've worked for, all three went bankrupt.\" Oh, come work for me. Y eah, when can you start? I thought sarcas - tically! She immediately saw the connection. Even though she didn't cause these companies to go bankrupt, she selected companies that had a pretty good chance of failing. And why? Because she was afraid of too much success. Jenny said to me, \"I'll tell you what, Bart. I will change my handwriting, and in 30 days, if my ‘y’ isn’t changed you don't have to pay me! Let me do a test run for you. \" I said, \"Okay . What do I have to lose?\" Jenny literally wrote me three or four pages a day of \"y's\" going straight up through the baseline. She was serious about making the change. Jenny ended up being our most dependable employee and one of my best friends 166 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"bored at work. However, you would experience faster change if you doodled \"y's\" during the fourth quarter of your favorite football teams comeback march to victory . Y ou would build stronger muscle memory if you doodled \"y's\" while listening to the theme to Rocky or Chariots of Fir e and imagining yourself as the champion! If you add emotions to anything you do, you increase the num - ber of neuro-pathways you create. When you add neuro pathways, the likelihood of this behavior becoming a habit increases. Handwriting is the same way. If you change it, and you do it consis - tently every day, you’re changing from one neuro pathway that’ s bad and giving it a new and better one (one that says you’re going to accomplish successful things). Now your brain has a choice. It has two highways to go down. If a person has the fear of success, their internal mind might think: \"If I work hard this week, I’ll most likely win the award for top salesman of the month.\" Then, because the self-sabotage is such an ingrained pattern, their mind will move forward to create scenar - ios in which he doesn't win the top award. If the person changes their writing, they may still think those thoughts occasionally, but the conclusion will be different. Y our brain will no longer tell itself the old self-sabotaging mantras. Y ou will have two neuro pathways to choose from. Y ou can choose a freshly paved \"success road\" or an old self-sabotaging road filled with potholes. Life is a bunch of choices. I T ' S M ORE C OMMON IN W OMEN THAN M EN It's interesting that the fear of success trait is more common in women's writing than men's. I find it about three times in women for every one time in men. It's significantly noticeable. My theory as to why this is the case relates to the difference in the way boys and girls are raised. When men were little boys, the culture emphasizes winning and achieving. There isn't much reward 169 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success 168 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty . T o conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom. — Bertrand Russell Y ou gain strength, courage and confidence by every experi - ence in which you really stop to look fear in the face.

I can take the next thing that comes along.\" Y ou must do the thing you think you cannot do. — Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"embarrassment. If this negative event is deeply emotional or occurs repeatedly, a fear of ridicule is developed. If you happen to be one of the millions of people who rank the fear of public speaking high - er than the fear of death, you might have some self-consciousness. In handwriting, a severe fear of ridicule is signified by the humps on the letters \"m\" or \"n\". This self-consciousness in their handwriting is shown when the second hump is higher than the first hump. It's interesting, because in handwriting analysis, the opposite of a stroke is not always the opposite meaning. In the letter \"t\", the low t-bar and high t-bar have reciprocal meanings. However, in the \"m\" and \"n\", it isn't the case. For instance, the opposite of the fear of ridicule does not mean you enjoy ridicule. Y ou also can't say, \"Just because I don't have a loop in my d-stem, I'm never sensitive to criticism.\" It doesn't work that way . This is why it may take a little bit of study with more advanced material to be 100% accurate when analyzing handwrit - ing. In this example, the \"m's\" that go downhill indicate diplomacy . Diplomacy means you have the ability to say things in a very kind way and be diplomatic. Diplomacy is a very positive trait. Self-consciousness has no redeeming factors. Therefore, the decision to exchange one for the other is a no-brainer. If your humps go uphill, it doesn't mean you can't be diplomatic. But it does mean that you have a little bit more self-consciousness than you have diplomacy. In handwriting, the stronger trait will occur in any letter where two or more traits might 171 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success for second place. Boys are much more competitive than girls. This might be one reason women grow up to be better team players than men. I have found that with women who have this \"fear of success\", there is a trend in the way their parents rewarded them. Their parents gave them love and affection if they came in second, third or fourth. Sometimes women and little girls actually got more affection for failing. \"Oh, it's okay, honey. Let's get some ice cream.\" One sure can't point fingers at a parent for being loving. But, since we learn based on pleasure vs. pain, winning must hold more pleasure than losing. Otherwise our brain gets wired to choose losing over winning. F EAR OF R IDICULE / R EJECTION (S ELF - CONSCIOUSNESS ) As humans, the need for love and connection sits at the core of our being. The fear illustrated by this \"emotional roadblock\" is dif - ferent than our basic emptiness when we are not loved. The fear of rejection or ridicule is a response to the social conditioning that occurs when we are children. Our brains are great learning machines. So effective that even just one strong emotional event can affect our behavior the rest of our lives. When a six year old stands up in class to answer a question, her brain makes a connec - tion. If she gets the answer correct and the teacher praises her, her brain connects standing up in class with a good feeling of approval. If she misses the question and the whole class laughs at her, her brain learns that standing up in class to answer a question equals humiliation and 170 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"evaluation. I'm not holding back on you ... it really can get compli - cated. I have found an interesting fact. Handwriting that indicates integrity is as much a function of noticing which traits are NOT pre - sent as a function of looking for specific strokes. Some of these roadblocks to success are exactly those \"negative traits\" and there are many more not discussed in this book. For this discussion, simply focus on the oval shaped letters such as the letters \"a\" and \"o\". I tend to use the \"o\" because it has proven to be more accurate. The way people write the letter \"o\" indicates how open they are with their communication toward others. Is your \"o\" clear and clean, like you could put your eye up to it 173 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success occur. Often, the letters will alternate one shape to the other shape. This indicates both traits are a significant portion of the personality . In a sales career, this trait is very detrimental to success. If you can't make cold calls because you're afraid they might say \"no\", you have a big hurdle to overcome. If you give me a stack of sales - men's handwriting, the one writing with self-consciousness is invariably the sales manager . Why? Because he has chosen to train and administer rather than deal with rejection on a daily basis. If you are single, you might experience self-consciousness when you meet someone new. If you feel nervous to speak or a bit uncomfortable about doing things wrong, you are feeling the fear of rejection. Here is a test. The next time you are in a social situation, pick someone across the room that you do not know . W alk right up to them and strike up a conversation. In many people, the level of anxiety in this scenario is in direct proportion with the level of self- consciousness you have. I guarantee you that by changing this trait you will feel positive results. There’s one way to find out if a man is honest- ask him.

A NGER OR R ESENTMENT A very important trait to eliminate right now is anger from your past. Clearly, the emotion of anger is in direct opposition to the emotion of happiness. Naturally, many people have issues from the past that are unresolved. Those issues can show up in a variety of ways in someone's personality. If you feel you have unresolved anger, then you must resolve it in order to be truly at peace with now and the future.

The following stroke does indicate anger. However, handwriting analysis does offer other indicators of such anger, but they are more advanced than I choose to describe in this book. So, if you have symptoms of anger, but don't have the stroke, don't be surprised. Thankfully the following stroke I do not find in high number of people. When I see a hard straight beginning stroke that starts below the baseline, I realize this person is hanging on to anger that has its source in the past. If the stroke starts within the middle zone, then the anger is more likely to be caused from a current situation. This stroke is usually very heavy and is straight and rigid like small metal ruler leaning toward the letters. I have only personally met a few people with a severe case of this anger and resentment stroke. One was an older bitter man who ran a Poker room in Las V egas. He was always rude to the staff and customers. Rumor had it the only reason he had the job was he pleaded guilty to a crime he didn't commit and spent time in jail in place of the casino owner . All I know for sure is he was one pissed off guy. He might have had some money in his pocket, but he sure wasn't happy . Another person was a man who faxed in his handwriting while I was on a radio show. He was actually a well-known politician in the Boston area. He had this resentment and anger stroke. Although he was pleasant during the interview and denied being angry, I think the handwriting was accurate. He was the state-wide tax enforcer for Massachusetts. I guess he found an outlet to express his anger - destroy people and their businesses if they didn't pay their taxes. I can think of more loving jobs on the planet.

Here is an interesting fact that might motivate you to find a way to rid yourself of all anger. Of the dozen or so handwriting samples I've taken from convicted serial killers, severe anger and resentment were the common traits found in all of them. This emotion doesn't make people violent or homicidal. This trait does fuel the fire if these traits are present. The most pervasive example of resentment is shown in the con - victed and executed serial killer named T ed Bundy’s penmanship. His handwriting is shown in the next diagram.

F EAR OF C RITICISM / S ENSITIVITY TO C RITICISM S ENSITIVE D-L OOP The tendency to be too sensitive to criticism is often confused with a fear of rejection. It is not the same. The fear of rejection is based on the fear of what might happen in the future. The sensitivity to criticism is a response to what is happening in the present. Naturally, if you feel pain each and every time you do something, you begin to expect the pain and adjust your behavior . In a phrase: words hurt. What people say or what we think they 178 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"have a high dose of pride, dignity, self-respect, or even vanity . People with tall skinny d-stems tend to dress very sharp. T all skinny d-stems indicate a preoccupation with their \"image.\" Y et the same person often doesn't give a flip about the criticism from just one individual. So if you have too much pride, it could end up as vanity . Arrogance is usually thought of as a negative trait. Pride is a good trait, but arrogance is a negative trait. These two traits are just a centimeter in difference. S TUBBORN D - STEM One last trait I want you to look for in the d-stem is stubborn - ness. This is depicted as a d-stem that looks like a teepee or a per - son’s legs spread wide like and upside down \"v\". A person who writes their d-stem like this will be very stubborn. In other words, they don’t like to be confused with the facts once they’ve made up their mind. They will argue a point even when they’re wrong. These people are hard to get to budge once they’ve made a decision about something. Y ou may know someone just like this. I would suggest that stubbornness is not a useful trait in most cases, because it means these people lack the flexibility to admit when they’re wrong and learn from their mistakes. Also, these people challenge relation - ships, because they have difficulty compromising when necessary 181 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success The best-case scenario is that I don't have a loop in my \"d\". It doesn't bother me if you laugh at my butt or tell me I walk funny . What if the wound on your arm spontaneously healed? No matter how much salt I threw at you, you would feel no pain. Re-tracing the d-loop is like healing an open wound. Does fear of criticism make a person bad? No. Does it make for a bad employee? Not necessarily. It does make us have strained relationships with those around us. Other people have to walk on eggshells around a d-loop person’s sensitive feelings. I would go as far as saying a very large balloon shaped d-loop is usually a big nega - tive. A large fear of criticism usually causes the person to lean on his defense mechanisms to handle the imaginary pain he feels. Do you have a loop in the lowercase \"d\"? A totally retraced short d-stem means that you don’t give a hoot about what people think about you. Y ou can still have compas - sion without being irrational and without feeling the emotional pain. W ouldn’t that be a nice way to relate to people? V ANITY D - STEM The height of the \"d\" also has significance.

There are many comedians who use this trait by making fun of themselves to be funny . By the way, this trait is accurate even if you are left-handed. Handwriting analysis does not care if you are right or left-handed. It also can't determine if you are male or female, black or white, Asian or American. Left-handed people tend to have the hardest time re- training themselves to cross the t-bar from left to right. But, it can be done. An example of how this simple change can affect your thinking is the story of Joe Lester. Joe was one of the first people I met as a freshman at Pepperdine University . W e have been friends ever since. Because I knew how to analyze handwriting even as a fresh - man in college, I offered my advice to my friends there. Joe is the only one I can remember who actually took my advice to change his handwriting. Even though Joe was left-handed and tended to print every - thing, he noticed he crossed the \"t\" backwards (right to left) and very low. So he made a conscious effort to change his t-bar. He gives me a lot of credit for his current successes, but I can only take credit for understanding the power of Grapho-therapy . When we were freshman, Joe drove an old 1979 brown T oyota Celica with the paint peeling off and no air conditioning. It was truly ugly. But, like most kids, we didn't have much budget for a new car . 183 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success or meeting people half way. If you notice this teepee-shaped d-stem in your handwriting, I would suggest you retrace the d-stem until the teepee closes. Y ou’ll find that after you do this, people are much easier to work with, because now you are. S TUBBORN D - STEMS / T - STEMS : The reason I have elaborated on the variety of shapes of the d stem is ... I want to make sure if you de-program one negative trait, you don’t accidentally program another one. So, remove the loop from you d-stem or make it smaller. But don't make the stem any taller than it already is. And retrace the d- stem, so that stub - bornness doesn’ t creep into your personality as well. Y ou’ll find that by closing that d- loop, you’ll quick - ly become less sensitive to what people say about you.

It reminds me of the Catholic guilt syndrome. Most people who are not happy with the Catholic Church's use of guilt as a mecha - nism for control find that the emotion of guilt can only be handled if they do something to suffer a while. Usually the emotion of guilt is painful enough to count as suffering. Other times, people attract relationships and even physical disease to keep themselves in a state of suffering. So, when Catholics conduct themselves in a behavior they were taught was wrong, they automatically feel bad. Remember our brain is an efficient learning machine. If you grew up Catholic, you may want to spend some time de-connecting the emotion of guilt from certain loving and pleasure-filled activities (like sex). I have no intention of picking on the Catholic Church. The same guilt feelings 185 Chapter 7 - Roadblocks to Success Joe drove his ugly Celica past the Ford dealership every day for almost two years.

I was meditating on this idea of how to best illustrate the art of maintaining happiness in one simple visual diagram. I sat in a quiet place and took inventory on my own life. I was happy, very happy. I thought about why my life was happy. I contemplated many models of psychology. I thought about Abraham Maslow's idea that we work up the pyramid of our own needs toward enlightenment (more on this in Chapter 10). I remembered Steven Covey's concept of categorizing your time into quadrants in which you stay out of urgency and focus on what is truly important. I analyzed my own satisfaction in the six human needs that will be covered in chapter 10, as well. Also, I remembered the very useful vocabulary words \"story\" and \"drama\" as originally coined from the 1970's EST semi - nars.

I set an intention of creating a useful model that I can use to guide myself daily toward maintaining a sense of balance and happiness. I asked my unconscious mind to take over. I left it to my inner source to figure it out, because at a conscious level I was coming up empty . Then I slept on it for several nights. Sometime within the following week, I woke up from a dead sleep with a vision. I scrambled for a pen and some paper on the bedside table. I started writing. I had a sense of what was in my inner mind, but I couldn't see it quite yet. As I drew the circle and imagined myself there, it became clear . I had created a model that makes keeping it all together as just a simple exercise in balance. The model even became more useful as I shared it with some of my more kinesthetic (feeling based) friends. It works. Here's what I came up with. I call this the \"Life Board.\" The purpose of the Life Board is to use it as a dynamic working metaphor for all areas of your life. The sport in which you pretend to play is \"Life-Boarding.\" Life-Boarding is an adventure sport that has its joy in \"being\" not \"accomplishing.\" There is no specific goal in mind.

The first step is listing what your stories currently are. Again, there is no judgment whether these stories are true or not. They just are your perception. What is happening right now in your life regarding your health that is unintentional? List any events you are dealing with: depression, cancer, the flu, a broken leg, a friend's health challenge, etc. What is happening in your love life right now? Make a list.

I even attend seminars and watch TV shows to pro-actively create excitement about my health and fitness. Because of this, I have very few health challenges that create drama in my life. I will discuss the impor - tance of living a healthy vital life in Chapter 12. So here is the bottom line. If you're not intentionally creating health, you are unintentionally creating sickness. If you're not inten - tionally creating wealth, you are unintentionally creating financial struggle. Invest early . THE FULL BLOWN LIFE-BOARD In my version of the Life-Board, I have outlined four quadrants. Actually, I prefer the model with six quadrants when I am meditat - ing on which areas need my \"intentions.\" In my six-quadrant ver - sion, I added separate categories for friends and spirit. Naturally , some people feel spirit travels with them in every category . Also, since my family is also part of my circle of friends, I often group them together in my dia - gram.

I will choose to believe that because my boyfriend did not come home last night means he was sleeping with another woman. Or you could choose... I will choose to believe that my boyfriend did not come home last night means he doesn't love me. Or you could choose... I will choose to believe that my boyfriend did not come home last night means he fell asleep again at his buddies and he is a bit irresponsible. Now. In most situations, we don't know which of the chosen meaning will turn out to be true. In fact, we may never know. So, it is wise to pick the meaning that creates the least amount of drama and emotional pain. Again, we are choosing stories and meanings without all the facts. Choose empowering stories.

From the past toward the future. It's like snow-boarding down a mountain. There might be bumps. There might be turns. It's all about handling what life hands you, and you come up standing anyway . I Imagine myself on top of the disk. I'm standing there looking down on the different areas of my life. I'm in balance. I spend time at the gym, I spend time on my love life, I spend some time work - ing on my long-term investments, and I call my Mom once a week. Everything is cool. Then, somebody comes along and whack, you lost $50,000 in the stock market. Then whack, your dog got hit by a car. Or whack, your mother is in the hospital. How do you keep balance then?

Y our weight won't throw off the balance if you have invested time in each quad - rant before you experience a crisis. Most people do this: they spend the time on the outside of the circle running from quadrant to quadrant like a rat on a wheel. Running as fast as they can putting one fire out before another fire gets out of control. Steven Covey, author of The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People, calls this living in \"urgency.\" Squeaky wheel does get the grease.

And the way you stay balanced is very, very simple: make good decisions. Every moment of every day, you have a choice what thoughts you focus on inside your mind. Spend time daily asking yourself, \"What can I do to create intentional excitement in each of these quadrants? How can I make an emotional deposit into my relationship, family and friends? Y ou know that if people get their needs met from you in peacetime (daily life), there is no reason to create a war (drama) to get there needs met. Imagine you are driving your car tomorrow.

Most of us just accept our rules as the right way to live. Then, as we age, we attract and select other people who have the same rules. The most obvious rules are the unwritten rules of what clothes are fashionable to wear. Perhaps you have to drive a certain brand of car to really fit in or live in a particular neighborhood. If you think about it, these are rules you have chosen to live by . This chapter is about more subtle rules you may not be aware of. I met an interesting guy recently . As I was opening a new cor - porate bank account, this nice older man sat down and patiently waited while a new clerk typed in my banking information. The clerk acknowledged him, and I had the distinct impression that Herb was one of the bank's most valued customers. Herb and I exchanged a joke or two then we went on our way . About a month later, I saw Herb lifting weights at my gym at 7 am. I'm sure I would have run into him sooner, but I don't get to the gym at 7 am very often. As Herb and I became friends, I marveled at his energy, youthful atti - tude, and even physical strength. Herb told me he was now 83 years young and never felt better. I thought to myself, I'm talking to an 83-year-old man who is both rich and happy - research time! I have this novel habit of asking the most successful and happy people I meet, \"What is your one secret of success or happiness?\" This morning Herb told me it was an easy answer.

What is the rule for allowing yourself to buy a new blouse or clothing item? Do you have to earn it? What is your own rule for letting your emo - tions show? (In other words, when is it appropriate or acceptable for you to cry, yell, scream, or laugh hysterically?) Does someone have to die before you allow yourself to cry? I remember the funniest scene relayed in one of Richard Bandler's books. A hysterical woman came storming into his coun - seling office yelling, crying, and sobbing. \"I can't take it anymore! I don't know what to do. I'm totally lost, etc.\" After about 20 seconds, Richard held up his hand in a stop position. He said calmly. \"Miss, just stop. Y our appointment has not started yet. Y ou are early. Hold on one minute.\" He stood up and got himself a glass of water . Meanwhile, the previously hysterical client simply stopped the tears and shut up. She sat down and waited while her eyes watched Mr . Bandler pour the water. One minute later Richard raised his hand and said, \"Now, continue.\" She started bawling and sobbing and resumed telling her story . The point to this therapist story is that everyone has rules when it is okay to feel certain emotions and when it is not okay to feel or express them. For this woman, during her counseling time was the totally appropriate place to let it all go. However, she truly felt like she had no control. When in fact, she had total control. She just had certain rules about when it was okay to act that way . Think about the real important emotions that you value so much.

Herb didn't realize he was telling me his rules for being happy. Herb's rules for being happy were simple. If he was alive, he was happy. Hmmm. Perhaps that is why Herb was happy all the time. I know another guy named Russell. He is an attorney who always appears to have just lost a big case. The brief time I visited with him, I asked him what was his secret to success. Russell answered without a smile, \"I'm successful because I've paid my dues. Someday I won't have to work this hard. I will have earned the right to relax and be happy. Life is hard so I work hard. There ain't no easy way to the top.\" W ow. Can you see why Russell is miserable most of the time and Herb always has a new joke to tell? Not only is Russell's belief system totally toxic, but his rules for being happy include being successful first. And, he believes he can't be successful unless he works hard for many years. Hmmm. That sure seems like a long road to drive just to be happy. I guess nobody told Russell he didn't have to live by his father's rules. (Russell's dad was an attorney, too. I have to guess his dad shared this \"success formula\" and Russell bought it.) I think it can be a revolutionary experience when we realize that many of our rules are actually keeping us from being happy. For most games we play, rules are designed to create order, structure, and perhaps fairness. In the game of chess, why can a Bishop move diagonal and a Rook only move horizontal? The answer is: that's the rule. In Soccer (European football), why must you use your feet only, but never your hands? The answer is: that's the rule. W e sim - ply accept rules as being fact without ever asking ourselves who made them or if they are the best possible rules to live by . As a society, we must have rules about traffic, ownership, real estate, sports, and the law. If we didn't have the commonly agreed upon rules, we might live in total chaos.

In fact, some people design rules as if their life were a game at a carnival - almost impossible to win. Remember those car - nival games along the Midway?

She is now firmly focused on being healthy without much concern about avoiding fat. Her rule for being healthy is 15% body fat. In fact, her younger sister suffers from Bulimia. More common among young women, Bulimia and Anorexia are diseases in which a person loses a tremendous amount of weight because she either refuses to eat or makes herself throw up after she eats. This is a case where the girl has extremely dysfunctional, irrational, and danger - ous rules about what her body must look like in order to be pretty . This family history may play a role in her particular rules. I know people who have rules about money that seem just as sick. Some believe that in order to be virtuous, a person must be poor. Some believe a rich man can't get into heaven. Some believe that the only way to be happy is to have money first.

If human beings have some basic predictable needs, then it would make sense that based on our indi - vidual history, we might see different options for meeting those needs. So, instead of focusing on the behavior we would like to change, perhaps we could ask what need the behavior fulfills and then simply find another action that could satisfy this need. T ake Bill for example. If Bill was getting a sense of \"significance\" by drawing attention via his obnoxious behavior, you would ask what other actions could Bill take in order to feel a sense of significance?

Self-actualizing people have many such peak experiences. In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a person must first satisfy his simple life needs before he can progress to more spiritual \"human\" needs. He states that a person will be very motivated by thirst, but quickly forget about their thirst when they can't get oxygen from the air. Breathing is a more fundamental need than drinking. Shelter is a security need which is more fundamental than experiencing love. His hypothesis is you must satisfy all the base needs before you can begin to experience the higher, Psychological needs. Here is Maslow's famous Hierarchy of Needs chart: Beyond the details of air, water, food, and sex, he laid out five broader layers: the physiological needs, the needs for safety and security, the needs for love and belonging, the needs for esteem, and the need to actualize the self, in that order . Y ou might notice that the need for self-esteem is just one step away from self-actualization. In my research self-esteem is also the key element in the personality profiles of rich and happy people. 1. The physiological needs . These include the needs we have 215 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs each day . The need of transportation still exists, so it must be dealt with. If you don’t provide an alternative vehicle, you might not like the results. Find him a ride. If you are discussing the action of saving money vs. blowing all your money on clothes, ask yourself what needs are being fulfilled by each action. For some people, having a large cash savings is essential to feeling the need of security or certainty. However, for others, they already feel a sense of certainty from their weekly pay - check. For them, the option of having new clothes fulfills the more pressing need for variety and perhaps even significance by wearing the right name brand of clothes. It is my opinion that if you can get your needs fulfilled in a healthy way, you experience ultimate fulfillment. Personally, ulti - mate fulfillment sounds like a very good outcome to aim for . The first time I learned about the concept of human needs was from the works of Psychologist Abraham Maslow . Abraham Maslow was a pioneer in the field of psychology. He was one of the first psychologists to study healthy people instead of sick people. His life work was devoted to investigating the inner workings of a \"self-actualized\" person and assisting others to achieving this peace - ful, happy, evolved state of being. Maslow believed that people already have the inner resources for their own growth and healing. Maslow is one of the founders and leaders of the humanistic school of psychology. He is most well known for his concept com - monly called, \"Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.\" The top rung of this Hierarchy is becoming self-actualized. He states, \"self-actualizing people tend to focus on problems outside of themselves, have a clear sense of what is true and what is phony, are spontaneous and creative, and are not bound too strictly by social conventions.\" He also coined the term \"peak experiences.\" These are profound moments of love, understanding, happiness or rapture. It is when a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient and yet a part of the 214 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"really onto something when he proposed that self-esteem issues were at the roots of many, if not most, of our psychological prob - lems. In modern countries, most of us have what we need in regard to our physiological and safety needs. It seems to be the self-esteem needs and the loving needs that keep us from experiencing the bene - fits of Maslow's self-actualization. All of the preceding four levels Maslow labels deficit needs. Which means if you do not satisfy them, your body craves you to do something to satisfy them. But once you satiate the need, you feel no craving at all. In other words, these needs cease to be moti - vating. As the old saying goes, \"You don’t miss your water till your well runs dry!\" I think Maslow's version of the human needs is a very useful model. If nothing else, Maslow has given us a reason for walking this planet. He believes we are here to evolve through the stages into enlightenment, or as he calls it \"self-actualization.\" In fact, this short summary doesn't really do the concept of his contributions justice. However, I don't think his ladder theory really covers the spectrum of all the needs and has a few notable exceptions. V iktor Frankl formed the basis of his book Man's Search for Meaning while suffering tremendous physical and emotional hardship in a Nazi concentration camp. Many artists could barely keep food on the table while they created their most outstanding work. Rembrandt and V an Gogh are great examples. So, it is clear humans can experience self-actualized thinking while experiencing deficits in the lower rungs of the ladder . All this theory on the human needs didn't fully explain why Bill chose to be obnoxious in my seminar or why a thirteen-year-old boy joins a gang in East L.A. It also doesn't explain why someone would spend four nights a week in a bowling league while his co- worker at the same day job works a second job in order to achieve financial and emotional freedom. Are there other needs that moti - 217 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs for oxygen, water, and nutrition. Also, this includes the needs to sleep, be active, heal, avoid physical pain and have sex. Maslow believed, and research supports him, that if a person lacks a specific vitamin, the body will crave a food that contains that vitamin. Some people crave orange juice not knowing con - sciously that they are deficient in vitamin C. This \"craving\" theory is important to understand that your nature as a human is to get your needs met. 2. The safety and security needs . When the physiological needs are largely taken care of, a person will become increasingly focused on creating a safe place to live and feel secure. In the ordi - nary American adult, this set of needs manifest themselves in the form of urges to have a home in a safe neighborhood, a job security and a financial nest egg. Fears and anxiety can occur when we fear losing this level of security . 3. The love and belonging needs . Once a person feels secure and fed, he might begin to feel the need to satisfy the emotional needs of being human. The person attracts friends, a lover, children, affectionate relationships, even a sense of community. Looked at negatively, he becomes increasing susceptible to loneliness and social anxieties. 4. The esteem needs. After the first three levels, Maslow says we begin to focus on self-esteem needs. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs, a lower one and a higher one. The lower one is the need for the respect of others, the need for status, fame, glory , recognition, attention, reputation, appreciation, dignity, even domi - nance. The higher form involves the need for self-respect, including such feelings as confidence, competence, achievement, mastery , independence and freedom. The negative version of these needs is low self-esteem and infe - riority complexes. Maslow felt that psychologist Alfred Adler was 216 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"vate us? I think there are. S IX H UMAN N EEDS I first learned about this model of the \"Six Human Needs\" from author and motivational speaker Anthony Robbins. He discovered that people all over the world seemed to display a pattern of the same life challenges. From his seminars and coaching practice, he noticed people were being pulled into different directions by needs that seem to be paradoxical. However, consistently across cultures, people always found a way to satisfy these needs. The problem was that these needs could be satisfied in a destructive or a healthy way . Y our brain wants you to find a healthy (no-drama way) to get its needs met. But, if you won't comply, you might find yourself smack dab in the middle of a destructive method of getting these six basic needs met. Let's take a look at these six basic needs and evaluate how you are getting them met in your life. The interesting thing about this version of the human needs the - ory is that you don't ever become completely satiated. W e simply fill up our tank for a while and have to fill up our tank again later. It is also a bit frustrating to realize that as we get one need really sati - ated, it pulls us farther way from another need. So we spend a lot of our life balancing these paradoxical needs. Realize that humans yearn to satisfy all six of these needs. Y ou are already finding ways to satisfy these needs. However, sometimes the method that you have chosen is filled with drama, crises and toxic thinking. I have arranged these six human needs in the form of a triangle. Naturally, you can exist while craving one or more needs, but it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain balance and avoid drama if you crave these unmet needs for too long. Remember that the needs described here are natural and necessary . The method you choose to satisfy these needs are a choice. 219 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs 218 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy If the essential core of the person is denied or suppressed, he gets sick sometimes in obvious ways, sometimes in subtle ways, sometimes immediately , sometimes later . -Abraham Maslow"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"C ER T AINTY / C OMFOR T The need for certainty goes much deeper than having a few dol - lars in your pocket or a roof over your head. The need for certainty is a deep-seated desire to have some predictable outcome, comfort, rules, or patterns in our life. The need relates to the basic motivation I discussed in chapter two: pain vs. pleasure. Certainty is the desire to avoid pain and gain pleasure. A high degree of certainty gives us comfort. Maslow’s lower needs such as food, air, shelter, and basic security would be considered a need for certainty . The opposite of certainty is total chaos. Earthquakes, war, and emergencies send our emotions stirring with anxiety. People will go as far as to give up their freedom to regain a sense of certainty . Germany elected Hitler in 1937 to regain some economic certainty . How many women have you known who stayed in a physically abu - sive relationship because they prefer the known pain vs. the unknown events that might occur if they leave? There are many positive examples of certainty. People get mar - ried because they want certainty in their relationships. Getting mar - ried often provides a feeling of consistent love and connection, improved financial security and sexual expression. This is a very healthy way to get this need met on a daily basis. The method you might be choosing to give you a sense of cer - tainty or comfort might also be the one thing that is holding you back from obtaining financial freedom. Many actions you could take to gain wealth require you let go of security long enough to develop another, more lucrative source of income. I would not sug - gest you quit your job without a logical way to pay your rent. However, if the job you are currently working in takes up all your spare time and you are not getting any closer to your financial goals, you must find a better way. It isn't just fear of failure that might be holding you back.

Because I live in an urban setting, I see many homeless people on a daily basis. I often pay them a few dollars to move boxes, take out the trash or sweep up the driveway. One summer day, I hired a transient named Dwayne to do some odd jobs around the office. Over the next few months, I hired Dwayne a number of times, and we began to form a mutual respect for each other. It was clear Dwayne had never been exposed to a lifestyle of abundance, kind - ness, and fairness. One day while taking a break, Dwayne confessed to me that he had lied. He hadn't worked in South Carolina for his sister. He had actually been in Federal Prison since he was 15 years old in Connecticut. I was one of the first people Dwayne met after he was released. He told me I was the only person who extended a kind hand to treat him with respect, offer him a job or give some cash when he needed it. I was honored by the compliment, but I must say I was very sad to imagine that my fifteen minutes of combined kindness to a stranger was a \"peak experience\" for this man. W ow. I'm sure I couldn't even imagine the pain he had experienced throughout his twenty-year prison sentence. T o make a long story short, here is how my short friendship with Dwayne ended. As we were taping boxes of books to be shipped, something strange happened. Dwayne had loaded some boxes into the truck and returned. I felt him walk up behind me and slowly put his right hand around my neck. At first, I thought he was hugging me with appreciation. (He had need - ed some hugs the night his mother died.) It wasn’t until his voice said with fear and regret, \"I’m so sorry I have to do this, Bart.\" It was only then did I feel the knife blade slightly touching my juggler vein on the left side of my neck. Dwayne was at least 6 foot 5 with hands the size of an NBA basketball player. He held the small kitchen knife in the palm of his hand – like I’ve seen people hold sharp objects in the prison movies. I knew he had held a knife like that before. 223 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs Some potential vehicles for obtaining certainty are: religious faith, property ownership, control, dominating behavior, learned helplessness, stockpiling food, a storm shelter, life insurance, money in the bank, etc. For most people, the need for certainty comes down to one word: control. People try and control their world and the people in their world to create a feeling of certainty. If you think back to the life-boarding diagram, you realize you can't really control all the events in your world. (I would argue that you have an influence in what events you attract, but that really is a more philosophical dis - cussion.) The one thing I know for sure is you do have total control of your decisions about what each event means. In other words, the only thing you can control is what something means. Once you decide to control the meanings of everything in your life, you can stop trying to control the events. Certainty is the feeling that an event will be as you expect it to be. T oo many surprises make us feel unstable, insecure, in danger. It is akin to the comfortable feeling of coming home after a long vaca - tion with tons of adventure. There is a special comfort about some place that is familiar to you. This is true even if every moment of that vacation was filled with luxury, silk sheets, milk & honey . Y ou still have a warm feeling to coming home to a house with a familiar smell. Until I fully grasped the concept of the six human needs, I would confuse this need with other values such as \"belonging, com - fort, familiarity, and security.\" After all, Maslow says security is a basic human need.

Uncertainty shows up in our love for surprises, adventure sports, movies, TV, competition, diversity, and all forms of excite - ment. Have you heard the phrase \"variety is the spice of life?\" How do you get a sense of variety into your life? Some potential vehicles for this are: new relationships, learning, accepting more responsibil - ity, taking on new challenges, sports, picking a fight, getting into trouble, breaking the law, drugs and alcohol. T ake a moment and list your methods for creating variety in your life. Just like the life- board game says, \"If you don't intentionally create what you need, life will create it for you in the form of drama.\" This may sound strange, but some people actually put them - selves into financial crisis, because it satisfies this need for uncer - tainty. Clearly not many people would admit to this at a conscious level. But how many times have people you know waited until the last possible minute to pay a bill or earn some cash. Procrastination is obviously a personality trait they might want to improve upon. They are also clearly more motivated by a deadline than the comfort they would feel if they just worked extra hard at the first of the month and relaxed having all their bills paid at the end of the month. As we learned from the life-boarding diagram, people often create drama because they despise boredom. I think the need for a bit of uncertainty or variety is also being satisfied by allowing drama to take over in financial situations. S IGNIFICANCE The need for significance can include a sense of being needed, important, different, famous, unique, making a difference and hav - ing clear sense of purpose. The need for significance is the need that I recognized most in myself.

Can you imagine a man needing a sense of \"certainty\" so bad that he would choose going back to federal prison where he had been raped and beaten? Clearly the need for a sense of \"certainty\" was stronger than his need for freedom, love, sex, creativity, fun, etc. Thanks to my encounter with Dwayne I understand the need for \"certainty\" at a much deeper level than I ever could have before. Also, my own survival needs were tested. As strong and physically fit as I am, my life was in danger. My sense of certainty was com - promised. I haven't hired a homeless man since. Because of that emotional encounter, my decision process about my own personal safety has changed. That was a minor incident in the scope of my life. But, I'm sure you have had major incidents in your life that have created an unconscious pattern for getting your \"certainty\" needs met. Y ou have to periodically go back and reevaluate those patterns. If you made the decision when you were 16 years old to never trust another person, then that system might not be the best choice to get your needs met as a 36 year old.

On the surface, I told myself it was for marketing. But at the core level, my need for fame was an overblown desire for recogni - tion. As I analyzed my own past, I recognized I had the \"not popu - lar\" emotions still hanging around from childhood. In my subcon - scious mind, I thought fame would make me feel significant. W ell, it actually was a very effective tool to make me feel significant. However, like any potential vehicle that you use to get your needs met, you have to ask what is the cost of getting this need in this way. My need to be famous was like a drug in which the same dose no longer had the same emotional response. For example, if I do a radio show these days or a local newspaper interview, my pulse doesn't race a bit. It has lost its sense of uniqueness. After about the 1000th interview, it felt like a natural extension of my career. So, I recognized that if I didn't find other ways to feel significant, I would be chasing higher degrees of fame all my life. I've watched celebrities play that game - I chose to find other solutions. For me, publicity is now simply a vehicle to contribute my ideas to other people. When I changed my perspective and intent, I found a rejuvenated motivation to hit the media circuit. I think I noticed the paradox most clearly at my high school ten-year reunion. I thought my recognition would make me more likable to my old friends. I have to assume they were either intrigued, curious or impressed. But my accomplishments did not create any more rap - port, love, or connection. In fact, with many kids it had the opposite effect. The child inside of me really wanted to connect or gain approval from this set of peers. The real emotion I was looking for was love and connection - I had wanted it through the vehicle of fame. That night, my sense of connection only came from the art of \"connecting\" on a humble compassionate level. I learned that the sense of significance and love / connection are two different needs that tend to have polarity. One pulls away from the other . There are hundreds of ways to gain a sense of significance.

Significance <----------- paradox -----------> Love & Connection LOVE & CONNECTION Many would argue that the emotion of love is the most power - ful emotion in the Universe. Many metaphysical and Eastern reli - gions believe that pure unconditional love and God are one in the same. It is clear that love and connection are basic human needs that we all must fulfill. Y ou can get the feeling of love and connec - tion in many healthy ways: bonding, oneness, sharing, intimacy , teams, marriage, sex, family, etc. I've heard of people getting this need met in very destructive ways. A friend's sister routinely smokes crack cocaine with her own mother . When asked why she does that, she simply stated, \"I didn't want to do it, but it seems to be the only way my mother and I con - nect.\" (And you thought your mother was dysfunctional! W ow.) Kids around the country get a feeling of connection and love from joining gangs. They feel connected and a sense of belonging that was often missing from their own family. It is often common for young girls to engage in sexual activity long before they are emo - tionally ready. So, they have sex with boys in an effort to get the love and connection they need. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it backfires. One of the paradoxes in the Six Human Needs theory is that the more significance you gain, the less love and connection is experi - enced. Because significance is also seen as uniqueness - most sig - nificance requires an elevated position or separation from the group. If you separate to be noticed, the ability to connect is weakened. I 231 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs obvious ones include winning a gold medal, being elected president or getting promoted. Other healthy avenues include taking on responsibility in clubs or churches, being the smartest kid in class, knowing the answer, being the class clown, having a different style, education, being a parent, owning certain possessions like original art. These ways do make us feel a bit unique. However, some people use destructive means to feel significant: schoolyard bully, violence, sarcasm and tearing down others, attracting a disease or physical disorder, or using scarcity as a means to get attention and recognition. Let's face it. If you are always the person who is \"down and out\" and the family is always coming to your rescue - you feel significant. In the therapeutic prac - tice called T ime-Line Therapy, Dr . T ad James frequently discusses how all people with a major disease have some emotional benefit associated with having that disease. Usually in hypnosis, Dr. James can discover the hidden emotional benefit they are receiving. In most cases, the needs of \"significance\" and \"love and connection\" are being met as a direct result of this physical crisis. It makes sense. If someone is having a tremendous craving for love, one of the fastest ways to spark their family to give it to them is to get really, really sick. Dr . T ad James and other time-line practitioners have had seem - ingly miraculous success assisting patients in spontaneous remission of life threatening diseases. The therapist’s job is to assist the patient in first locating and changing the original unconscious deci - sion that started the disease process. Secondly, they work with the patient in creating another, healthier way to meet these needs. The largest roadblock to recovery is finding a replacement method for obtaining the \"hidden benefit.\" V ery few patients will admit at a conscious level that contracting a life threatening disease has some hidden benefit. But, in James’experience it always does. As I stated before, your mind is a very powerful creator.

If you do not have a lover in your life that assists you in getting your love and connection needs met on a daily basis, I suggest you read it.

In summary, find a way to get your sense of love and connection in a healthy way. If you don't ... drama will step in to create it for you. G ROWTH For me, personal growth has been the background fabric of my life. I can track the level of my success by the amount of time and money I have invested into my own personal growth. I routinely meet people who have never read a self-improvement book. I scratch my head in disbelief. They claim they want to be rich, but never read a book on investing. They complain about being lonely , but never attend one seminar on relationships. Even the people with weight and health problems do try various diets, but few actually ever learn the fundamentals of being healthy . They are just focused on not being fat. It is my personal belief, that if you do not make an intentional effort to constantly progress in your personal and spiritu - al growth, life will create its own, harder, curriculum for you to learn things. The purpose of investing in personal growth is to discover ways to experience more life fulfillment. Perhaps this is a more spiritual idea than a psychological idea. I have a belief that we choose and attract people into our lives to learn lessons. I would go as far as to say our entire mission on this planet is to learn lessons. The Hindus 233 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs noticed it almost immediately in my early days as a handwriting expert. The more famous I became, the more of a target I became for other, less recognized, handwriting experts. If people have low self-esteems, then someone else's success often makes them feel like a failure. The easiest way to erase that jealous feeling is to criti - cize the person succeeding. Y ou see this in every corporation and political party in the world. For me, it was confusing. I personally introduced more than 5 million people to the incredible science of handwriting analysis dur - ing the 1990’s. That exposure and credibility had to assist in other handwriting experts selling more books, getting more business, and generally being more respected. However, because I was the one receiving the \"fame,\" I was getting less connection (and no love) from my peers in the industry . On a personal level, I also noticed the more I did things to make me feel significant, the more it alienated many of my friends. If you go through a period of sudden financial windfall, many of your friends will treat you differently. In fact, many studies of Lottery winners who win a million dollars or more reveal most of them believe their life was more fulfilled before they won the money . How can that be? Because they didn't have the wisdom to maintain the connection and love that was there before the money . Imagine a circle of blue-collar workers who get together weekly to drink beer and criticize the \"suits\" at the factory and complain about taxes. For these guys, part of the basis of their sense of con - nection is this sense of scarcity, anger, and feeling of being an underdog. If one of those guys wins a million dollars and quits his job - he has lost rapport. Most people find that as they increase their income and improve their financial status, they are forced to make new friends. Because rapport is based on a perceived sameness - people lose rapport when one of their group members outperforms them.

Eventually, one would achieve nirvana and not have to return to this earth plane for more lessons. The Buddhists use the word enlightenment to describe this state of spiritual awakening. Abraham Maslow describes this state of mind as \"self-actualized.\" All of these different terms refer to the end result of a lifetime of personal growth. If you don't make an intentional effort to read books, attend seminars, or constantly find ways to stretch yourself and grow, then you will be forced to learn the lessons and have growth the hard way . W ell-taught, interactive seminars are like \"boot camp.\" They set up situations that don't have dire consequences so your brain can learn new behaviors. If you learn it in a controlled, intentional envi - ronment, your brain starts to make new neuro-pathway connections to assist you in changing.

I do find that the this need to contribute is more commonly obtained on a daily basis by those people who are skilled at getting the other five needs met in a healthy and ecological way . This might be because inherent in the spirituality of contribution is that the other needs get fulfilled. When you are contributing, people respond to you in a way that meets many of the other needs automatically .

His name is Greg W ilson. And, I hope that by the time you read this, he is the most famous comedian in the United States. However, I've known him for five years and for the last four years, he has been stuck in second gear. His goal is to be a cast member of the TV show Saturday Night Live , and go on to be a famous comedy actor . He could easily be the next Robin W illiams or Eddie Murphy. But first, he has to make some shifts in his own thinking. He must be willing to take more risk. His struggle for success relates perfectly to the concept of \"needs.\" Before I explain, let me tell you that Greg is one of the funniest guys I have ever met. My sides hurt from laughing so hard even if we just have lunch together. Imagine how hard I laugh when he is on stage. Secondly, I really want Greg to succeed. I hope writing about this insight helps both you and Greg achieve success faster . I discussed the concept of the \"Six Human Needs\" with Greg on the set of The Process of Creative Deception (a recent independent movie we appeared in together). I quickly discovered the real rea - sons he has made very slow progress in his career. Greg thought his roadblock to success was merely a question of location. If you want to break into comedy and acting, it is commonly accepted that you must live in New Y ork or Los Angeles while you get started in your career. (That may be a limiting belief ... but it is a belief with lots of statistics that support it. Be where the action is.) Greg needs to move to New Y ork City. He has known this for years. When I asked him, \"When are you moving,\" his answer was he didn't know. Upon probing, the first excuse was one that many of us use: \"I don't have the money.\" In Greg's case, he had spent his early 20's hopping from temp job to temp job earning wages and not saving a penny. So, the thought of moving to New Y ork City to become an actor was frightening. New Y ork living expenses are about three times more expensive than Dallas, T exas. He \"believed\" 237 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs gram. Scheduling contribution as part of your life might be one of the most important \"success secrets\" that most people overlook. Y ou don't have to look any further than India's Mahatma Gandhi. If you haven’t watched the amazing movie starring Ben Kingsley, I encourage you to go rent it. There are so many incredi - ble pieces of life wisdom illustrated in the life and teachings of Gandhi. In the context of this discussion of needs, Gandhi's primary mission was contribution. He dedicated his entire life to the seem - ingly impossible mission of freeing India from British rule through his policy of non-violence. An interesting thing happened to Gandhi when he made his sole focus on contributing to the welfare and hap - piness of his country . All his other needs automatically became ful - filled. The world held him up as a national hero in his lifetime (sig - nificance). He had unending opportunities to travel, meet millions of people and create change (variety). He was loved and adored by his family, friends, and his country (love and connection). And, as a result of his work, people always surrounded him to provide his basic needs of food, clothes, security and comfort (certainty). Actually, he was famous for making his own clothes by hand using Indian yarn. T ruthfully, his incredible faith gave him a higher sense of certainty than most people ever experience. If you want to model some very useful and powerful belief systems, study some of Gandhi's teachings. Are you willing to sacrifice your needs to get your dreams? Have you ever seen amazingly talented people living mediocre lives? It is very common. Billy Joel sings about this in his hit song Piano Man . His lyrics go like this, \"They sit at the bar and put bread in my jar and say , ‘Man, what are you doin’ here?’\" Just because you have talent does not guarantee you will become rich or happy .

(Once a belief is set ... action or lack of action follows.) Hmmm ... I found myself thinking, what's the difference? He can be poor in New Y ork just as easily as he can be poor in Dallas. Why not be poor where he could be \"discovered?\" So Greg's lack of financial abundance and his unwillingness to \"learn\" what it takes to become financially wealthy has kept him stuck. Y ep, having no money really sucks. Ask Greg. I know this because I had repeatedly offered Greg advice on writing books, doing odd jobs, getting into radio, or other money making deals over the past few years. Greg always had resistance to any opportu - nity. Excuses varied - results were the same. For a long time he would never get a real job. He just took temp jobs. One day I asked, \"Why aren't you at a real job that pays well?\" He said, \"Because I'm going to go to New Y ork City and I'm going to make it big. I don't want to be tied down when that call comes.\" I said, \"If the call comes, you could just quit.\" He put himself in a state of uncertainty about both his finances and his moving to New Y ork. In fact, if you want to analyze it even more, one could say he found lots of benefit from living in scarcity . Much of his standup stage act focused on his lack of money. \"I’m so poor ...\" This is a good comedy tip: get rapport with most of your audience.

Greg needs some leverage - some hardcore moti - vation. He has to create for himself a strong enough \"reason\" to leave this all behind and go for his dream. J EWEL A great example of a star who had this leverage comes to mind. In 1998, a new pop music sensation hit the American music scene named Jewel. She was just 15 when she talked her mother into packing up their station wagon and moving to Los Angeles to break into the music business. They drove all the way from Alaska to Los Angeles and spent every last dime of their savings. The first month in Los Angeles, they both slept in the car and showered at the pub - lic showers on V enice Beach. Jewel had talent-o-plenty. She took her guitar and performed at every restaurant, bar and club she could. Sure enough, an agent heard her angelic voice one night and signed her to a record contract. Some would say she was lucky to be in the right place at the right time. I say luck is timing meeting preparedness. If it weren't that producer, it would have been another one. Jewel is very talent - ed. But, her unyielding persistence and commitment to her dream is why she is a star today . After all, it is unlikely she would have been discovered by a record producer if she stayed in Alaska. What do you think would have happened to Jewel had stayed at home and became a big star in her small town? What would happen if she were getting most of her needs met from her close family and 241 Chapter 10 -Six Human Needs information that really explained his lack of action. How could he be getting his needs met when he was financially struggling and his dreams were unfulfilled? First, think about the pain vs. pleasure principal. If there was no immediate pain in his life today, his moti - vation to make a change is less. Further more, if he was experienc - ing pleasure, he had incentive to stay . If he moved to New Y ork, what happens to his needs? He is no longer significant. He is insignificant. He is a \"nobody\" in a town of greatness. He knows nobody there, so he would be lonely . There is a lot of uncertainty in both the financial and emotional arenas. So, the first few months of his New Y ork experience, he would be crav - ing certainty, significance and love. Let’s evaluate his life in Dallas, T exas. He performs in Dallas' top rated Improvisational Comedy T roupe each weekend to a packed house of fans who scream his name. In fact, he is a local celebrity. People stop him on the street and recognize him. (Need fulfilled = significance.) Cute, young, single, sexy women come to his shows and treat him like a celebrity. (Needs fulfilled = signifi - cance, variety, love, and connection; and one more not on the list: Sex ... lots of sex.) Furthermore, his three brothers also live in Dallas. (Need fulfilled = love and connection.) If sense of family is an important value to you, you can see how this is fulfilling. Family that lives in the same town gives people an added sense of security . The guys in his comedy troupe are his best friends. (Needs fulfilled = certainty / belonging/ connection.) In summary, he's got a fun- filled life of local celebrity status, lots of young sexy girls throwing themselves at him and best friends. So why would he want more? W ell, he has a dream. A dream that is bigger than a part-time comedy troupe in Dallas, T exas. He thinks he is talented enough to be a top rated stand-up comedian, star in a sitcom and even work in movies.

What would have happened if she had six brothers and sisters begging her not to move out away from town. I don't know the answer to that, she might have moved anyway. But, I suspect Jewel wasn't getting many of her needs met in the small town in Alaska. If she was experiencing pain or getting none of her needs met, then she had a lot of leverage for her to \"get out of town\" and follow her dream. If you have a dream, you have to find a way to create some leverage on yourself to take action. There is an ancient legend in Greek mythology of a General burning his own ships after he landed in the harbor. He was telling his men that there was no turning back - that is leverage to do it, now . In Greg W ilson's situation, his local success might just be what was holding him back from his destiny.

And finally, if you allow yourself to \"feel\" the same feelings as the characters in your mental movie - it will feel real. What must you think about in order to go from sadness to hap - piness in under sixty seconds? What voices or thoughts did you hear yourself say in order to make that emotional journey? And finally , what did you do with your body to quicken the process? For most people in live seminars, they can do negative emotions with very little coaching. Is your brain wired to access those emo - tions faster than total elation? If so, start rewiring it now . There have been long books written on this form of state management. For that reason, I will not go into massive detail on this important topic. However, I will give you the big chunks of information and urge you to take actions to master your emotions. The difference between a champion and an \"also-ran\" is how effective the athlete is at con - trolling their internal state of mind. The mental part of sports is real - ly about controlling levels of enthusiasm, motivation, anger, energy , internal pictures, internal dialogue and physiology. Life is no differ - ent.

Get excited. Y ell, jump, laugh, smile. D ID Y OU P LA Y A LONG ? Are you happier than you were a second ago? Do you feel dif - ferent? Is your blood pumping? Did you break a sweat? Is your brain spinning? If you didn't play along - shame on you. If you use your body AND your brain ... you can change states instantly . And, isn't happiness just a state of mind? Learn to use your body to guide yourself into any emotional state. Any good actor knows this. In order to \"be\" a character, you must \"feel\" that character's feelings. The reason I lead people at my seminars to jump up and down and act like they just won a million dollars is so they can experience first hand the powerful effect that physical movement has on your \"state of mind.\" Intense movement or other physical sensations cre - ates instant \"chemicals\" to be shot through your bloodstream. The faster and more intense you move, the more intensely the chemicals are dispersed. That is why it is very hard to feel depressed when someone is tickling you or you are laughing hysterically . Imagine walking through the woods enjoying the peaceful scenery . Then, 20 feet away you spot a twelve-foot-tall grizzly bear growling in your direction. How quickly does your heart start beat - ing? How fast could you run if he takes one step towards you? How fast would your body change from \"joy and peace\" to \"fear and anx - iety?\" Scientists call this the \"fight or flight\" response.

As I dis - cussed in an earlier chapter, even a small micro movement in your finger fires off very specific neuro-pathways in your brain. Imagine what happens when you do ten jumping jacks or fifty pushups. Imagine what chemicals shoot through your body when you hear a train coming toward you while your car is sitting on the railroad tracks. Those fast, instant, fearful feelings you might have are actu - ally the result of chemicals shooting through your bloodstream in an effort to get you to take action. Y ou don't need an actual event to take place outside yourself in order to spark the chemical rush. All you have to do is be proactive with your body! Movement is a key to controlling your state of mind. Holding your body in certain posi - tions or moving them in specific motions triggers pre-set feelings that might be associated with that movement. Clapping your hands, jumping rope, or jogging in place might spark instant emotions from times past. Learn to get up and use your body to induce pow - erful emotional states. I NTERNAL P ICTURES Sad thoughts create sad emotions. Some people visualize a time when something sad happened (a funeral, their dog died, the close of a business, loss of a game, etc.). The key to quickly gaining emo - tional access from a mental picture is to adjust the way the internal picture is played inside your mind. Y ou can adjust your own internal pictures in many ways. Y ou can make the image bigger or smaller, darker or lighter, bordered or flush, colored or black & white, grainy or clear, closer or farther away. Remember the submodalities we discussed in chapter four? All these techniques will adjust the emotional intensity of any mem - ory or internal picture. It's like playing with the dials on your TV set. When you adjust these \"sub modalities,\" you affect your own 251 Chapter 11 - Secret of State Management \"emotional programs.\" Do you ever accidentally hit the \"run pro - gram\" button on these: Anger, frustration, upset, misery, pity, guilt, sorrow, jealousy, fear, anxiety, depression, hate? If you ever experi - ence any of these limiting emotional states realize this fact: These emotions are a result a very specific process that you \"do.\" Y ou don't just feel jealousy ... you \"run\" jealousy . People who can control their emotional states have more \"peak states\" and fewer \"bad days.\" Therefore, these people tend to be more productive, attract and keep better relationships, and have more energy to get things done. In short, you want to be a \"state management expert.\" There are three basic methods for controlling your emotional states. 1. Physiology - Learn to adjust your body . 2. Internal Images - Learn to control the pictures in your mind. 3. Internal Dialogue - Learn to control the words, phrases, and sounds inside your mind. All three of these techniques can be used to influence the kines - thetic/feeling part of you. Let's face the simple and brutal truth. If you can create states of silliness, happiness, and sadness in under 60 seconds, why aren't you happy all the time? The answer is that you haven't made up your mind to \"do happiness\" all the time. The mind and body are not seperate, they are one. You cannot use one without affecting the other.

What must you do before your mind directs you to feel such enticing states as passion, lust, happiness, laughter, joy or peace? Y our brain does one key thing ... it makes a decision. This sounds simple, but it is powerful. Y ou make a decision to allow yourself to \"create that state.\" For instance, if you were to actually see the bear in the woods, your unconscious mind would make the decision for you to feel the \"fight or flight\" response, leveraging on your autonomic nervous system. In this case, you make an unconscious decision to create an emotional state: terror . T error pumps adrenaline through your veins and you can run faster than ever before. A very useful state when being chased by a bear . The problem with most people is they believe events in the out - side world control their emotional states. When in reality, the out - side world gives you events. Y ou decide what that event means for you. Y our brain makes a decision as to whether that event means sorrow, fear, joy, laughter, etc. Here is a how it works... 253 Chapter 11 - Secret of State Management level of emotion. Many people use perspective to adjust the internal emotions. Y ou may find that a memory seems more realistic when seeing the event through your own eyes. This is called \"first person visualiza - tion.\" First person is the most effective way to go back and feel memories of past events. This is also useful to know in order to stop feeling emotions from past events. If you want to gain some emo - tional distance from the memory, you simply change your perspec - tive to \"third person.\" This is named for an imaginary person who could be observing you from 20 feet away . The term \"second per - son\" would be used if you were remembering talking to a friend and decided to imagine the entire conversation through her eyes. Simply switching to a third person perspective dramatically reduces the emotions you feel as you recall painful events. Once psychologists and hypnotists discovered the power of these simple changes and sub modalities, they became very effective in assisting clients in overcoming severely limiting emotional blocks such as traumatic memories, fears, and phobias. (These techniques come from the field of NLP.) I NTERNAL D IALOGUE Most people talk to themselves via an inner voice. Using the power of language, you can learn how to talk to yourself in a way that induces specific states. Car manufacturers have discovered that both men and women actually \"buckle up their seatbelts\" if they program a woman's voice to remind the driver to put on their seat - belt. If car manufacturers can change the voice in your car, why can't you adjust the voice in your head? Y ou could make the voice strong and bold, soft and sexy, yelling, begging, giggling, singing, laughing, etc. Some people can even adjust the location the voices come from, and it makes a big difference whether or not the com - mands come from behind your head instead of in front. The concept 252 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The reason you sometimes skip steps 2, 3, and 4 is that the event had occurred so many times in the past, you have already made the decisions of 2, 3, and 4 and those decisions became unconscious habits. Steps 2, 3, 4 are hard-wired into your nervous system to be at the beckon call of each event. Inanimate objects can hold instant triggers to past events. Y ou already count on this mechanism to make you feel good. Sometimes triggers can be a great part of being human. Think about the various inanimate objects in your life that spark an immediate emotional reaction: Perfume smells, religious symbols, sentimental songs, team logos, high school letter jacket, photographs, etc. Often, trig - gers can work against us in ways that are unproductive. For many people, the mere mention of their ex-spouse's name puts them into an instant state of anxiety. For many, the sight of the Nazi war sym - bol fills people with anger and sadness. (There is clearly justifica - tion for such emotions. However the symbol is the trigger to have the emotions. When you allow something outside of yourself to become a set trigger - you give up having choice over your emo - tions.) Furthermore, with a bit of further education and practice, you can intentionally set specific \"triggers\" so you can feel good auto - matically. It is also possible to erase a trigger even though it seems to have been programmed unconsciously. It takes conscious aware - ness, intense emotion, and a specific event. In the chapter on grapho-therapy, I recommended you actually think about your goals and even listen to inspiring music while you practice your handwrit - ing changes. The intent is to have the mere viewing of the letter \"t\" serve as a trigger to feeling confidence. The t-bar changes work without the added emotions that music or correct visualization brings.

If so, could you put your - self into that \"state of mind\" instantly? According to the above chart you can have the emotional state of happiness simply by participat - ing or observing in some event in which happiness is the appropri - ate emotion. Like a chain reaction, you will experience happiness each time this event occurs. In the field of NLP, this is called a trig - ger or an anchor . Examples: Y our lover whispers in your ear, \"I love you.\" --> Y ou feel loved. Y our lover kisses you on the neck. --> Y ou feel sexually aroused.

Instead of the movie of your boyfriend in a hotel with another lover, you ran the movie of him saving a dog's life. New movie = new emotion.

This is an act in futility . Y ou can spend all your energy trying to control other people, the traffic, your boss, the economy or your spouse. And, I agree, it would be wise to surround yourself with people and things that push the \"positive\" emotional buttons as often as possi - ble. Likewise, if you have buttons that create negative emotions, it would be prudent to avoid people who push those buttons, too. However, there is an easier way. Just take control of any deci - sion in steps #2, #3, or #4. At every point, you make a decision that eventually affects your emotional state. Let's face it. Y ou are going to have an uphill battle if you try to control #1 (all events in the world). But, it will be much easier to decide for yourself what meaning the event has, or what emotions to feel, or even if you choose to feel any emotion. So, here is the big secret to being happy: Make a decision to be happy in the moment. This is so important I'll say it again. What it takes to be happy is very simple. It takes a decision to be happy in that moment. Y et we go through life, and we let everything else screw up our attitude. Y ou get a speeding ticket, so you get pissed off at the cop. Don't you?

Remember that if you ask a question enough times, you will get an answer. I found out what was wrong with me, and I will explain how I fixed it in the following chapter . What was occurring was my focus was on #1 - the events. I was successfully controlling the events in my life to give me what I thought would make me happy. But, I had not been putting enough time or energy in controlling the specific thoughts or emotions that occurred as a result of my unconscious thinking, physiology, or actions. Once I decided that it wasn't the external events that would make me happy, I looked on the inside. I began an intense investi - gation of my health, my purpose, and my emotional states.

I hadn't seen her face-to-face in over 5 years. It was fun to catch up on old times and rekindle the friendship. Staying with someone 24 hours a day gives you a real nice snapshot of how much they value health and health related education. The sad truth was she had no understanding of what her body needed or what made her truly healthy. She complained that she was \"always get - ting sick.\" She knew her immune system was weak, so her solution to her weakened immune system was to become a clean freak. She went as far as to not use the same spoon as someone else when eat - ing ice cream. So, she adapted her world to deal with her \"compro - mised immune system.\" She tried to change the outside world instead of changing her inside world. It never occurred to her to go investigate the source of the problem and fix it. As I watched her food choices, it was obvious why she had some health challenges. First, she chose to eat red meat at every meal. She preferred hamburgers and French fries to anything vege - tarian. She kept a bag of chocolate candies in her purse for snack - ing. She even bought four pints of ice cream while visiting for just two days. None of these things are horrible in small quantities. But making these food choices over a lifetime can lead to dire consequences. Because she was thin, her poor eating habits were not obvious to the average person. She was unwilling to learn the art of giving her body optimal nutrition so it can fight it's own battles with full power. She was unaware of the value and necessity of fresh live food (vegetables) in her diet. She was unaware of the need to drink lots of water and eliminate or reduce her caffeine intake. She was unaware that too much caffeine overworks the adrenal glands. In a nutshell, she was simply ignorant about the commonly known fact that nutritional choices have direct correlation to your health. She simply thought, \"I'm skinny.

In almost all cases of those \"crappy Monday\" feelings, I can trace my loss of motivation back to poor eating, drinking, or health related choices. I felt miserable.

Many medicines such as \"antibiotics\" (anti-life) actually kill small micro-organisms. This is useful the first few times.

Anaerobic exercise includes those activities that create an oxygen deficit in order to get a burst of power - sprinting, weight lifting, power lifting, power yoga, etc. Both forms have their advantages. If you are low on energy - focus on aerobic. If you are low on strength- anaerobic will be very useful for you. Personally, I alternate both weekly so I am balanced in strength and stamina. W EIGHT T RAINING (A NAEROBIC EXERCISE ) In a normal week I invest about five hours into my health quad - rant via exercise. I usually spend one hour at the gym - three days a week. Then I jog, ride the stationary bike, or do some form of yoga for another 60 combined minutes during the week. I also figure I invest an hour into dressing, undressing, and getting to the gym. When I have the extra time, I’ll exercise for five days (3 weight and 2 aerobic sessions) and take two days off for rest. I use a simple yet powerful routine that I recently learned from author Bill Phillips in his book Body for Life: Twelve Weeks to Mental and Physical 270 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Strength. If you are interested in weight training or need to lose weight, I recommend you visit my health recommendation's web page and order Bill's book. Bill maps out an easy-to-follow routine that works wonders at burning fat and strengthening muscle in less than one hour per day. I've been lifting weights (off and on) since I was 15 years old. Bill's program is the first that I have used that actually proved to give me fun, fast, recognizable progress in my size and strength the first 30 days. When you add up the numbers, he asked that you invest just under 40 hours over a 12-week period to have the body of your dreams. W ow. Small investment - great reward. In addition to all the boosted energy and confidence you feel with a great body, you will also be 40 hours more intelligent. Y ou see, a small investment in a portable walkman and a few hundred dollars into some educational audio programs will equal two college courses. While you exercise, you learn via audio tapes. Health and learning become two emotional values you get to feel on a daily basis! I’m a believer of the phrase, \"Use it or lose it.\" If muscles aren’ t exercised on a regular basis, they atrophy, sag, and weaken. They become of little use to you. And believe me, it is hard to find your inner strength, when your outer strength is gone. Simple weight training is a great way to build and maintain strength. If you’ve never been to a gym or feel like your body lacks muscular defini - tion, then I recommend starting a weight-training program immedi - ately. Join a gym or buy some inexpensive portable dumbbells to keep near your desk. Y ou will be amazed at how many dumbbell curls you can do while talking on the phone. W eight training might be painful at first, but it becomes addictive in a good way . W eight training actually causes minor tears in the muscle fiber . As your body rebuilds these tears, using protein and amino acids, you are rebuilt stronger and firmer . Y ou’ll notice after weight training for a while, the stronger your muscles feel, the stronger you feel on the inside.

Y our muscles do not have to get old and weak. They only atrophy when you don’t exer - cise them regularly . A EROBIC E XERCISE I like to balance my exercise routine between aerobic and anaerobic. So on T uesdays and Thursdays I focus on exercising my cardio-vascular system: I get my lungs pumping. Also, fast move - ment is excellent for the lymph system. Because your lymph system has no organ to pump out the toxins, movement is the only way this system gets flushed. Aerobic exercise is where I really strengthen my stamina and feel that burst of endorphins to my brain. Research shows that aerobic exercise is essential in healing all forms of depression. I have many options to get that legal dopamine rush: I can get my lungs breathing heavily and increase my heart rate by jogging, fast-walking, swimming, bike riding, Kung-Fu, aerobics, etc. I’ll do this for as little as twenty minutes some days. According to Bill Phillips, you don’t need to do cardio exercises for an entire hour . T wenty is plenty . According to other health experts, you should warm up for fifteen minutes and exercise in your zone for forty minutes or more. I don't know who is most accurate - I just know what works for me. I suggest finding an exercise you enjoy doing. Some people pre - fer bike riding, while others love jogging through the park. For me, I like to mix it up. I’ll ride my bike one day, go jogging another . Make sure you stretch and warm up for at least ten to fifteen min - utes before any hard workout. I stretch using yoga poses or a light jog to warm up. 272 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy On weekends, I give myself the freedom to rest if I so choose. After all, I’ve put my body through 3-5 days of exercise, so it could use a couple of days to regenerate for the upcoming week. What is more often the case, I usually have so much leftover energy that I like to do a fun physical activity on Saturdays like hiking, dancing, mountain biking, skiing, or playing football with the boys. There is nothing like pure physical play to make you feel young again! \"Throw me the ball! I’m open!\" Y OGA / T AI C HI / K UNG F U While weight training and running are great for building strength and stamina, I’d like to recommend a couple of exercises that increase the body’s flexibility and balance. After spending time with some 70 year old men who look about 35 – I’m convinced that proper nutrition and exercise are the secrets to the fountain of youth. Y oga is a form of exercise that combines body postures with deep breathing. Although Y oga is somewhat new to the western world, it was developed several thousand years ago in India. For the past 30 years, Y oga has grown in popularity in the west. It is a great exercise for stimulating vitality, increasing flexibility, enhancing overall good health and the ability to relax. I highly recommend taking a Y oga class and exploring how it can benefit you. I find that after every Y oga class I take, my mind feels relaxed and at peace, while my body is tingling with energy . Any stress I had that day is gone. For me, Y oga is a moving meditation. And if you think Y oga is for sissies, try \"Power Y oga\" – the same poses, only longer and more strenuous. It will challenge you and make you sweat."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"275 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy A NCIENT T IBETAN R IGHTS No matter how busy you are, you can always find 7-10 minutes a day to stretch and bend in the middle of the floor .

This set of stretching exercises aligns the spine, releases endor - phins, balances your chakras (energy meridians of the body), and stretches your muscles. When I was younger, I used to have lots of lower back pain. After doing these simple exercises for less than one week, the back pain disappeared completely. Plus, it stays gone as long as I keep up these \"ancient rights\" and take care of myself. Everyone I know who has used these simple thousand-year-old techniques has seen profound results.

T AI C HI / K UNG F U I have always been enthralled at the acrobatic maneuvers I wit - nessed in those Chinese Karate movies. It wasn't until I was an adult that I began to realize the health and spiritual benefits of the martial arts. Before I studied Kung Fu, martial arts were some strange mystical fighting style for those guys who enjoyed fighting. Actually, most real eastern martial artists are spiritually balanced, peaceful, and very unlikely to actually start a fight. What's more, I discovered in Korea and China that the martial arts instructors also worked as the villages’medical doctors? Why? The concept of man - aging your Chi explains it all. In eastern medicine, Acupuncture practitioners believe that sick - ness is caused by a blocked flow of Chi - or energy. So, the art of managing your Chi could be accomplished through martial arts as well as health practices. In fact, since I've been studying with Master Song, I have seen him prescribe T ai Chi to most of his patients over 35. Stretching and strengthening the muscles are an essential step in recovering from injury. Plus, when you add the benefit of learning to control your Chi - it is a powerful elixir! Developed in China, T ai Chi is a \"soft\" martial art that focuses on building internal strength as opposed to the \"hard\" martial arts, 276 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy #2 Leg lifts - Lie flat on your back with your palms facing down. T ilt your head up so your chin touches your chest. Lift both legs into a vertical position. Hold. Repeat. This will strenghten your stomatch and lower back muscles. It is also supposed to fur - ther stimulate the seven chakras. #3 Neck Bend - Crouch on your knees (both feet behind you/ bottom of toes touching the floor.) Put your arms to your sides. T ilt your head back so you can see the ceiling above and behind you. Then tilt your neck forward until your chin touches your chest. Repeat. Don't fall backwards. This stretches your neck and back muscles. If you work at a computer all day, you will notice this will be a wonderful tool to loosen your upper back and neck tension. #4 Back Bend - This is the most challenging for someone who is really inflexible. W ork up to it. The process is to move from a sitting position to a squared off back bend. Start by sitting with your hands to your side, palms down, chin to your chest, toes up, legs extended in front of you. (Sitting position not pictured.) Then, in one movement, bend everything back by pulling your pelvis toward the sky. Keep your head aligned horizontally with your torso. Don’t arch your torso like a rainbow. Keep your body squared off. Repeat. These next two moves are key movements from modern Y oga. They are essential in keeping your whole body flexible and strong. Y ou will notice your shoulders getting stronger as you are able to hold these positions for a longer duration. #5 Y oga Full Body Back Stretch - Lay flat on your stomach with your palms face down next to your shoulders.

When you take a T ai Chi class, you will learn to move your body in ways that increase the flow of energy . The Chinese call this energy Chi or life force. For me, T ai Chi is like a very slow dance, where you gracefully move from one stance to the next. Y ou can lit - erally feel the tight parts of your body \"releasing and opening up.\" T ai Chi also clears the mind of all that unnecessary chatter and brings you to a state of inner peace. I’ve found that T ai Chi is excel - lent for keeping you balanced and stress-free. Again, it is a moving meditation. T IME & E XERCISE Now for those of you who might be thinking you \"don’t have enough time to exercise,\" that’s just your old limited belief system working against you. Ignore it. Y ou must think of exercise as a necessity - like food and water. It is the fuel for your body. Exercise is what gives you the strength to make the rest of your life run more smoothly. In reality, we all have the same amount of time in the day . W e have all the time that there is. Personally, I find that a five-day workout plan actually gives me so much energy I can reduce my sleep requirements more than 90 minutes per night. So, instead of eight hours of sleep, I can get up feeling refreshed after just 6 - 6.5 hours of sleep when I'm exercising regularly. In my experience - exercising gives you MORE TIME. When you search your busy schedule you will discover you really can find the time to squeeze in a little exercise each day . Think of it this way . There are 168 hours in a seven-day week. As I mentioned earlier I invest just over 4 hours a week into exercise. When you look at the big picture, just four hours a week can net you twenty extra healthy years. Or, if you are motivated by pain that four hours you didn't exercise could cost you a lot of pain and suffering during the final years of your life.

Remember , use it or lose it! S IGNS OF D EPRESSION OR J UST P OOR T HINKING P ROCESSES ? In the previous chapter, I alluded to a time in my life when I should have been happy but wasn't. Those dark thoughts led me to an important lesson in biochemistry. I have no idea if this section will apply directly to you or to a loved one of yours. Because I am writing a book on happiness, it makes sense to discuss one of the major causes of unhappiness — depression. According to recent studies, one in eight Americans (12.5% of the U.S. population) suf - fers from depression. If that statistic is true, that means there are a lot of unhappy people out there turning to their doctors for help. One of out of every twelve people you know could be struggling with the chemical side of un-happiness. Don't be quick to judge them for not simply controlling their thoughts. There might be a chemical basis for such emotions. When the word depression first entered my reality, I thought I was struggling with some existential crises about the meaning of life. I found myself thinking, \"I've created everything I want, but I'm still not happy.\" For me, I thought I could control everything with my mind. What I couldn't control with my mind, I could con - trol through physiology. I was right, but I didn't understand what I was dealing with. It wasn't until I realized the significance that brain chemistry has on my \"state of mind\" that I made serious effort to get all the facts about how to keep my brain in optimum perfor - mance mode. Until I acknowledged my brain was out of balance, I was unable to find a way to keep it in balance. Do you know anybody who has taken prescribed anti-depres - sants? The most common psycho-pharmaceutical drug in America is 280 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy 281 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy Prozac. This brand name is a drug sold for treating depression or social anxiety disorder. Even if you are not at all depressed or never ever take this drug, it is useful to understand what this drug does to the brain and why it is prescribed to millions of people a year worldwide. Research shows Prozac does affect certain seratonin levels in the brain. Seratonin is the natural \"happy\" chemical released by the brain. So for many people, Prozac does have a direct effect on the level of happiness they experience. According to the best selling book Listening to Prozac , this drug can turn shy people sociable, depressed people happy, suicidal people stable, etc. W ow . A pill can do that? (Yes, a pill can do that and a properly mixed batch of Korean health tea can, too.) Prozac was the first FDA approved selective seratonin reuptake inhibitor introduced to the American Market. T oday, there are many other brands of medicine to treat depression (Prozac, Zoloft, W ellbutrin, Paxil, Celexa, Nardil, Parnate, Elavil, Anafranil & more). There are many other \"natural treatments\" that don't get near the attention. www.stop-depression.com or www.bartbaggett.com/health Since 1988, Prozac has been used by over 38 million people worldwide. It has been prescribed so much because it has amazingly positive effects for many people. I would be the last person to endorse psycho-pharmaceutical drugs considering my life's focus on the power of the mind and bent toward alternative natural medicine. However, after experiencing the effects of this type of drug first hand - I now have a deeper level of empathy and understanding for this condition. If you are seriously depressed, then just by \"under - standing\" that you are not losing your mind but instead have only a chemical imbalance can provide tremendous relief to a struggling spirit. That being said, I don't recommend staying on prescription medication more than a month or two. There are natural treatments"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"283 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy that have no side effects and won't raise your insurance premiums. It may be an effective treatment if you are one of the people who doesn't get the short term side effects. But you should be aware of the side effects of taking Prozac. One common side effect is total loss of your SEX DRIVE. That alone would make me depressed! The following numbers are percentages of people having symptoms from the drug and the percentages have the same symptoms on a placebo: nausea (23 vs. 10 percent), headache (21 vs. 20 percent), insomnia (20 vs. 11 percent), anxiety (13 vs. 8 percent), nervous - ness (13 vs. 9 percent) and somnolence (13 vs. 6 percent). I don't have any statistics to tell you the long-term side effects. I do believe this though: taking a drug of this type does not help you heal the cause. It only affects the symptoms and can lead to a lifetime of dependency on the drug. As with any dis-ease (mental or physical), look for a completely natural solution before you turn to prescrip - tion medicine. Losing your sex drive is not fun! The three important lessons I learned from taking prescription anti-depression medication for two months was this: 1. Medications have horrible side effects that your doctors don't always warn you about or might not even know about. 2. Medication can have a fast and positive effect on the symp - toms of depression. It works. 3. Happiness can be induced by chemical changes in your brain chemistry . Knowing what I know now, I take extra care of my mind and body to insure I keep my brain chemistry balanced. I don't take pre - scription anti-depressant drugs and never will again. I found a nat - ural alternative to keeping my brain chemistry balanced. (Nutrition, vitamin supplements, and exercise.) 282 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy W HA T IS E CSTASY ? Have you ever heard of the designer street drug called \"ecstasy\" or \"X\"? W ell, there is a good reason they call it ecstasy. It's because this drug makes you feel the emotion called \"ecstasy.\" In America, around the turn of the century (2000), ecstasy passed up all other drugs (except alcohol) as the drug of choice for American teenagers. Back in the 1980’s, ecstasy was legal and very trendy. I tried it once during college. It was truly an awesome brain high. It's just plain and simply a \"get happy\" drug. It kick starts your own little internal pharmacy and injects the \"feel good chemicals\" right into your bloodstream. In my non-scientific opinion, I think ecstasy is like 20 Prozacs hitting your bloodstream at the same time. It essentially sucks the seratonin from the reserves in your brain and shoots dopamine out into your bloodstream. Essentially, dopamine is the brain's happy drug. Prozac simply adjusts the \"vacuums\" and inhibits the self-cre - ated chemical from dissipating as quickly. Ecstasy actually sucks your brain dry of all your storehouse of the chemical and treats you to an overdose of your own happy juice. So, you experience higher levels of your own happy drug. It's no wonder kids love it. It is hap - piness in a pill. Is happiness really just an emotional reaction to a chemical reaction in your brain? Are you creating dopamine & seratonin when you get up and dance, make love, or laugh? Are you actually creating drugs in your bloodstream naturally? Y es. Y our brain is actually \"shooting\" the chemicals into your bloodstream. Most of the chemicals are already made and waiting for the right \"cue\" to come out and play . Y ou don’t need drugs to experience happy feel - ings. So, learn to start pushing your own happy buttons. So the secret to happiness is to take ecstasy . Who said that? No ... I'm kidding.

B OOST Y OUR E NERGY U PLIFT Y OUR D EPRESSED S TA TE The state of low energy or depression can be a real momentum breaker on your way to the top. Whether you feel down because of physical or emotional reasons ... taking physical action can provide instant state shifts. Furthermore, consistent maintenance via nutri - tion and exercise can send the blues away for good. Whenever you notice that your body is low on energy or you feel depressed, try some of these techniques. Deep Breathing – Breathing sounds simple, but don't underesti - mate the power of this under utilized energy pump. The \"ha breath - ing technique\" is an exercise that gets the oxygen pumping up your body and to your brain. It’s quite fast and effective. This is great to do before a workout or while just sitting at your desk to give your - self that extra pep. Y ears ago, I taught hypnosis seminars to assist 284 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy people to stop smoking in one session. Hypnosis works because it allows your own mind to function roadblock free. Most smokers believed the act of smoking gave them energy . Actually, the deep breaths (albeit filled with smoke) actually provided an oxygen rush which they normally didn't get. Apparently, I was the first person to give them permission to just breathe deeply without a burning can - cer stick in their mouth. Give yourself the gift of pure oxygen. Here is how . First, take a deep breath, inhaling through the nose for about 5 seconds. As you do, raise your hands to shoulder level as if guiding the breath up your body . Then, as you exhale, make a long \"ha\" sound that lasts the length of your exhalation, about 10 seconds. While doing this, push your hands from your shoulders down to your waist. Repeat this three more times. Expanding your lungs and moving the breath up and down your body will increase the blood flow in your body, and you will notice that you feel more energized. If you are at work and are a bit self-conscious about making loud \"ha\" sounds while sitting at your desk ... relax. The mere act of taking a very deep breath, holding it in for a few counts and expelling it for a longer count will triple your oxygen intake. Remember to expel every last breath of air so you get all new fresh air on the next intake. Don't be surprised if this exercise gives you a fun head rush at first. Get Y our Body Moving – Sometimes when I feel unmotivated, I take a walk, jog, or go hiking. Now this may sound like the oppo - site of what you feel like doing when your body is lethargic. But you’ll be amazed how this simple act of \"movement\" changes your state. I’ve found that sometimes all my body needs to increase ener - gy is to get up and move. So I suggest doing anything that gets your body moving: walk, jog, dance, do jumping jacks. Moving your legs and working your lungs increase the oxygen to your brain and release happy brain chemicals called endorphins. After just fifteen"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"287 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy minutes of walking you will feel your energy increasing. There have been many days when I was under a deadline to work hard and keep going, but all I felt like doing was taking a nap. The decision to jump on the mini-trampoline for ten minutes or do fifty pushups has literally bought me two hours of effective work time. If you have the luxury of being able to take a walk in nature - you will really feel rejuvenated. (Remember, humans use oxygen. T rees and plants emit oxygen.) Play Some Fast, Upbeat Music – Music is a very quick and powerful state changer . There is something magical about upbeat rhythms that excites the brain and lifts the body’s energy . Do you remember the theme song from the movie Rocky . Whenever the boxer Rocky Balboa was training hard, the sound - track played very upbeat, energizing music to match the audience’ s feelings with Rocky’s drive to be a champion. Every time I hear the Rocky Theme song, I feel like boxing, jumping up and down, and waving my arms like he does when he reaches the top of those steps. Moving your body is the fastest way to change your state. Music accelerates this process. The scientific study of brain waves and brain synchronization gives us scientific reasons why we expe - rience different states while listening to different musical beats. Baroque music actually has the beat as our Alpha brain patter . Y ou are relaxed and learn faster in an Alpha brain state. (This is the tar - get brain wave pattern in hypnosis and meditation.) The Beta brain wave is a much faster, short sound wave. This beat is often found in disco, rap, Hip-Hop, Big Band, and modern Dance/Industrial music. Y ou can't help but get pumped up when you listen to music with this beat. So, pick your tunes carefully. I shake my head in pity when I see an office environment with a \"no music\" rule. How do they expect their employees to keep up their tempo? Since sadness and fatigue have a very high correlation with slow moving brain wave patterns, I highly recommend that when - 286 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy ever you’re feeling down or unmotivated, play some dance music, swing music or fast rock n’ roll. Then, get up and dance and shake your groove thing. T ake V itamins / Minerals – The conversation about vitamins and mineral supplementation could take up 12 books and not even scratch the surface. I will say this. In today's fast food world with a farming community of chemicals and depleting top soil minerals worldwide - it is highly unlikely you are getting all the essential and trace minerals you need just from your food alone. Now, you may be fanatical about getting your pure organic foods in every possible combination. But, in most cases, you are low on key vitamins and minerals which could dramatically change your health. I have seen men simply add copper to their diet and their gray hair turns back to black. I have seen a simple liquid potassium supplement double people's energy and cause spontaneous healing of aches and pains. I have seen the consumption of shark cartilage free arthritis sufferers from winter pain. My mom takes flax seed oil to give her smooth skin and strong nails. My dad eats raw garlic to keep the colds away - it works. There are hundreds of unconventional and effective nat - ural remedies that work by giving the body what it needs to heal itself. Y ou have to decide to discover what works best for you. I have found that in addition to a basic multi-vitamin, I function better on extra doses of vitamin C and complex B. These help in my energy creation and immunity. I also notice a profound difference in my \"life energy\" when I consume fresh real Blue Green Algae, Ginseng, Spirulina or Chlorella. If you buy the powder form, you can just mix it into a fruit smoothie in the morning. About ten years ago, my friend Dana Margolis suggested a vita - min mixture to help me have more energy. She told me to just visit the local health food store and ask for 500MG of V itamin C, 250 MG of V itamin B-6, and 500 MG of L-Phenylalanine. She said this combination would make me feel better. Funny thing happened, it"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"289 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy lifted my spirits immediately.

If you aren't experiencing that right now - your body is talking to you. Any nutritional supplements can have unexpected effects, so please test them for yourself. I don't use L-Phenylalanine anymore because it seems to eventually make me tired from its tendency to over spark my adrenal glands. St. John's W ort had the same effect on me (eventual fatigue), but this is not common for most people.

It moves us to where we want to go, it keeps us alive, it motivates us to eat, to sleep, keeps our blood flowing and organs doing their job.

I suggest turning the lights down and lighting a candle. This can create a very calming atmosphere. If you choose to listen to music – select instrumental music that has a very slow rhythm. Start with silence until you find music that simply blends into the nothingness. I suggest you sit on the floor with your back against a wall or in the lotus position (legs crossed).

That’s right, all those desserts, cakes, muffins and cookies ... they’re enemies to the successful person. Forget about the fat issue. That's obvious. Sugar content controls blood sugar level. I only truly understood the power of blood sugar while dating a diabetic woman in 1994. I didn't understand that even \"healthy foods\" like fruits and pastas quickly turn to sugar and send your blood sugar levels skyrocketing. Diabetes is one of the #1 diseases in elderly people. In my opinion, it is caused by all the work they forced their pancreas to do while they were young. Sugar is the enemy of the sugar sensitive person. White sugar is notorious for bringing your energy spiraling down after a brief high. There is an abundance of great information at the website: www.weightlossdoctor.com about the effect of sugar on your sys - tem. The information will astound you at how sugar affects your body, weight, and energy level. Most of my chiropractor friends that are trained in Applied Kinesiology say sugar is a pure poison that short circuits the electro-magnetic nature of our body. I sure like the sweet taste. Darn. So the next time you are tempted to eat a donut for breakfast, remember that that sugary food choice will bring your energy down after the initial high. Not a great way to start the day.

Remember detoxifying your system is key to being disease free. Live food and water cleanses. Dead animals, dairy and processed foods clog your system. Since your body is over 70% water, you might consider making 70% of your diet water rich live vegetable foods. Do it for a week - you will feel energized! Food clogging our system is one of the number one reasons our bodies feel weak and tired. Rather than write a whole book on nutrition (there are plenty I can recommend), I’m just going to mention a few of my eating habits that work for me. If they help you, use them. If they don't appeal to you, find your own. First, I rarely eat heavy red meats like steak, hamburgers, beef fajitas and pork. Red meat is one of the worst body cloggers. It can stay in your colon for days, weeks even. It’s also very high in cho - lesterol and can make you constipated. Ever felt like taking a nap after a huge meal eating lots of red meat? W ell, that’s because it takes most of your body’s energy to digest that animal flesh. T oo much heavy digestion can really slow down your momentum for the rest of the day. Now I admit I love a great hamburger every now and then, so I’m not asking you to stop eating the meats you love. I’m suggesting that you limit your heavy meals and increase your intake of light vegetarian meals. For instance, try eating vegetarian every other day, or at least every other meal. Y ou’ll notice a huge increase in your energy level, because you’re giving your body time to digest the meat from the previous meal. Some vegetarian alterna - tives are salads, grilled vegetables, tofu, veggie burgers, pastas and rice dishes. When you do decide to eat a meal with meat, choose chicken or fish over beef or pork. Chicken and fish are leaner and easier to digest. If you eat in restaurants frequently, ask the server if they have a vegetarian option. Most chain restaurants offer a few vegetarian entrees. Y ou will be surprised at how full you feel and the great flavor ."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"remember the TV images of the Alaskan coastline covered in oil when the Exxon V aldez spilled millions of gallons of oil in the ship - ping accident years ago? I can't erase the images of oil covered geese getting stuck in the oil and dead fish covering the beaches. When you fill your body with toxins and don't clean it up, your cells become like those struggling geese. They can't function nor - mally . Cleansing your body on a regular basis is just as important as eating healthy . The easiest way is to drinks LOTS of water each day (at least eight glasses). Eating a dependable source of fiber in your diet will also cleanse your colon. If you’re not regular, then you’re clogged. And if you’re clogged, you are creating a toxic wasteland at the base of your colon. If you think you aren't full of toxins, I dare you to go get a professional colonic. Even the healthiest eaters get toxins and need cleansing. A colonic will let you view with your own eyes what's been eating you. When you get unclogged, you will be surprised at how light and energetic you will feel. When I detoxify myself and eat a pure vegetarian diet, I sleep better, need less sleep, have more energy, and think clearer. (When I do that, I must take amino acids and iron supplements. T est everything on your own body.) Here are my suggestions for keeping the inside of your body clean and working properly: Fiber - Eat high fiber foods like bran cereal, apples, pears, prunes and vegetables like carrots and broccoli. I’ve discovered a whole grain cereal called Kashi that you can find at the grocery store. Y ou boil it like pasta and eat it hot. It has a chewy texture, and tastes great when you add honey or syrup. Kashi works fast to clean out the body and gives you a boost of energy as well. T ry it. Colon Cleanser – If the idea of a professional colonic frightens you, use the slower route. Y ou can fast for a few days on juice, water, or nothing. Or, there are colon-cleansing supplements at your 297 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy 296 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy occasion. But I eat sugar foods sparingly and not on days when I can't afford a huge spike and crash in my blood sugar level. Protein gives you slow burning energy. Sugar gives you spikes of energy . Here’s an idea that may help you keep track of your sugar intake. Make yourself some dessert coupons allowing yourself to eat one heavy sugar based dessert each week. Whenever you’re tempted to eat a candy bar, you can pull out your coupon and ask yourself, \"Do I want to spend my one dessert a week on this or save it for something better?\" Some people find keeping track in this manner helps them make better eating choices. I have found that repressing our desires for fun foods can be counter productive. Flat avoiding foods we like often causes resentment and a negative asso - ciation with the healthy lifestyle. Keep it all in moderation. Caffeine has similar effects on your energy level. Coffee increases your acidity level, overworks your adrenal glands and dehydrates you. T ea and Coke also contain high amounts of caffeine and sugar, too. I recommend bottled water with lemon with every meal. (I don't see how you can get your 8 glasses of water a day if you drink Cokes and Coffee, too. Y ou would spend your whole day in the bathroom!) T oo much caffeine borrows tomorrow’s energy for today. Eventually, it will cost you. When I want to drink coffee, I bargain with myself. I agree to drink two large glasses of purified water for every single cup of coffee I have. Y ou don't have to elimi - nate anything completely.

Y ou might visit an alternative practitioner every couple of months and check the overall conditions of your health. Y ou might go to a chiropractor for a spinal adjustment or some Applied Kinesiology, a Chinese Herbalist for a balancing for - mula or acupuncture.

The idea behind preventative medicine is that you take measures to keep yourself in optimum shape. I’ve gone through many flu seasons, when everyone was getting sick around me, and I remained perfectly healthy . The reason is when your immune system is strong you’ve got more defenses against people’s germs. Germs don't cause sickness.

Drink W ater – Drink lots of water . Y ou have heard this for years and yet you probably still don't drink enough. Think about Dr . Carrel's cell living forever.

He said it was from a non-cancerous lump in his chest that he didn't have checked out until it was so big his shirts looked funny . That was all the motivation I needed to get my butt into gear. First, I called my western doctor. I had to know if this was a freak of nature or if I was turning into a woman. I had heard of lumps in a woman's breast, but never a man's. And, I did not want to sit in the waiting room for a mammogram. No thank you. So, I made an appointment. As soon as I returned home to Dallas I was in Dr. Koval's office getting my chest examined. After the examination, Dr. Koval began asking himself two questions: \"Is the lump cancerous?\" and \"How can we get it removed the fastest?\" It turns out such nodules were quite common in men, and he recommended I get a biopsy immediately to find out if it was cancerous. The statistics say that if you spot cancer early , it can often be treated successfully. So, from a western perspective this was the right recommendation. They would most likely have the lump surgically \"cut out.\" Ouch. Now, this is sounding pretty painful and expensive. I keep health insurance, but knives and surgery are not my idea of fun. So, I said \"Thank Y ou\" to Dr. Koval and drove straight over to Dr. Song's office. (Dr. song is my eastern philosophy Oriental Medical Doctor . Y es, they have 8 year colleges for OMD degrees.) I was never the kind of kid who settled for an answer I didn't like. Dr. Song and I sat and shared some green tea before we began dis - cussing my medical problem. It's nice to actually visit with your doctor for more than three minutes. (Dr. Koval visits with me, too. But no green tea.) After the tea, Dr. Song inspected the swollen area and began asking me some questions. \"Have you been eating anything different?\" \"How long has it been there?\" \"Have you been taking any medications?\" 301 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy 300 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy fix it. Now, most people reading this would choose answer (c). Now be honest with yourself. If you had a source of irritation in your life, would you take the same approach?

Evaluate what you did to get yourself in that situation and fix it. Now, be honest, would you have picked (c) in this scenario. Most people do not. If you are reading this book, I suspect you did pick (c) at some point in the recent past. Y ou found yourself less than \"happy,\" or less than \"rich.\" Good job. I keep two doctors in my life: a western medical doctor (Dr . Koval) and an eastern medical doctor (Dr. Edward Song.) Both are very qualified, but they approach the world by asking different questions. I'll relay a rather personal story . A bit embarrassing, but I think you will learn something from my experience. I was showering a few months ago when I noticed a small nodule in my left chest. Since I have been on a structured weight lifting program, I was noticing my chest was getting bigger and stronger. But a lump in the left pectoral that hurt when touched was not part of the training program. I thought it was nothing and it would go away in a few days. That weekend I was in New Y ork visiting a friend of mine. He showed me a three-inch scar underneath his nipple from surgery he"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"two weeks. I paid Dr. Song for a custom brewed set of Korean tea - bad tasting liquid sealed in little brown packages. I took it three times a day and threw away the Propecia. The lump slowly shrank and then disappeared. (All without surgery.) The point of this story is quite simple. Y ou are at cause of everything that happens in your life. (You may never find out what the cause is ... but believing you are at cause gives you great power.) Y ou also have many options. Y ou have to look. When I spoke to my western doctor (Dr. Koval) the next week, to inform him of the good news, I asked him a very direct question, \"Have any of your other patients that have taken Propecia also had breast lumps?\" He said, \"Yes. It is not uncommon.\" I asked why he failed to mention this critical piece of information to me. He said, \"They all had lumps in both breasts, not just one. I didn't think it was related. In any case, the safest route was a biopsy.\" Y et, know - ing this pattern ... he still didn't try to find the cause. I wasn't upset because Dr. Koval wanted to fix the symptom - that was his job. Medicines have so many side effects, it is impossi - ble for any one man to keep them all straight. Dr. Koval is one of the most well read physicians I know on herbs and alternative natur - al health. He always supports my unconventional eastern cures. But, he has years of training to ask a different set of questions. The same questions he was taught in western medical school. He means well. His intentions were good and his methods were proven - from his own belief systems and own experiences and literature supplied by drug companies. I would probably be okay using either method. The reason I have two doctors is because I want the best of both worlds. I want to choose which belief system, which methodology , and which process is going to work best for me. In this case, it seemed obvious to me that the drug caused the lump. Stop taking the drug - lump stops growing. T ake special herbs - heals the wound. I took total control and total responsibility . 303 Chapter 12 - Secrets of the Super Healthy 302 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Clearly, Dr. Song was asking a very different set of questions than my western doctor. Dr Song was asking himself, \"What is the cause?\" W ell, upon thinking about Dr. Song's question, I remembered I had been taking a popular hair loss drug called Propecia (aka Proscar). I began taking it two months ago when I noticed my hair thinning a little bit on top. \"Ahhh,\" Dr. Song said. \"You must stop taking that right now! Y ou have been taking female hormones - that is what causing your problem. I will make a batch of custom herb tea that will make lump go away.\" (He has a rather thick Korean accent - but it is worth listening to him extra close for the pearls of wisdom.) Then, it clicked. My friend in New Y ork had started taking the same hair loss drug one year ago. Hmmm. That could be the cause. Notice Dr. Song began looking for the cause - not trying to sim - ply \"remove the symptom.\" Dr. Song wanted to give my body what it needed to heal itself. Let me set the record straight about my thinning hair. Losing one's hair is a common thing for men, especially after they turn 30. But, my hair has always been my best feature - and I was deter - mined to hang onto it. My father lost his hair and has been happily bald since he was 23. Since my mom still had a full head of hair, I thought my chances were 50/50. So, when it began happening to me, I was noticeably perturbed. I was not giving in to nature with - out a fight. So, I asked Dr. Song what he was going to do about me losing my hair. (As if it was his fault that I couldn't take the hair loss med - icine anymore. Ha.)

H OW T HIS L ESSON C AN A PPL Y TO Y OU & Y OUR M ONEY This lesson can apply to any problem in your life. If you are constantly broke - fix the cause. Some people start looking for a new credit card or a loan. They refinance their house. They start looking for a higher paying job. Or, they might work really hard to elect a new politician to change the system. These are all ways of fixing the symptom and not dealing with the cause of the money problem. W e will go into more depth on the cause and effects of not hav - ing enough money. But here is a basic quick fix. First, you are most likely spending more than you make. In America, this is practically a modern day ritual. Cut up the credit cards, stop spending as much money, save 10% of every dollar you earn, and stop the bleeding. Now, make a plan to build financial security . What is the cause of you being the age you are and earning the level of income you are earning? What decisions did you make last year, five years ago, etc? What path did you choose? What are your beliefs about how much money you can earn? How important is being rich to you? What choices can you make this year to build more wealth? The truth is all you have to do to take inventory of your mindset is to look around you. T ake inventory of you life. The reality you are living in right now is a direct result of your thoughts and beliefs about the world. If you’re alone, poor, stressed out, or unhealthy ... your thinking is at the root cause. Begin changing your mind now , and your body and world will start changing. It may take six months for the changes to be obvious, or you may notice changes immediately - but start now . By the way, after I got my body and hormones back in balance ... my hair loss stopped. I believe because I made such a firm deci - sion to keep my hair ... my head obeyed. I also decided to become detached whether or not it happened. Let me explain that last state - ment. I made a decision of the outcome I wanted: T o keep my hair . But, because I also accepted the possibility of losing my hair, I stopped worrying about it. I stopped putting focus on what I didn't want to happen. Remember your mind is a creating machine. It tends to manifest into reality your most dominant thoughts. So, if you focus on what you do not want to happen ... that is often what you get. Y ou might want to check my photos ten years from now. Let's see how well my hair obeys my brain. Hey, according to my 62- year-old father, women dig bald men. What? Me worry?

My father espe - cially was impressed with my new ability to create rapport with anyone. However, when I explained the specific techniques, he said, \"That’s nothing new. I've been doing this for 20 years!\" T rue, Dad has always been a natural at creating rapport, and the techniques have been around for ages. But what is new is we are now able to teach rapport in a step-by-step analytical way . The reason we know these techniques is because researchers studied the most charming, the most influential, and the most effective communicators on the planet - and modeled their behavior. Dad was correct in that many of the techniques were not new to him. However, until now, he couldn't effectively teach the skills to a new person because he was 309 Chapter 13- The Secret Power of Rapport is enough to create a sense of trust with your circle of friends. If you make it a habit to treat everyone you meet with fairness, kind - ness, and generosity, these people will be around to support you for the next thirty years. Even if deals go sour, your behavior in the deals will be remembered. Before you can call up a friend from five or ten years ago and ask him to help you achieve a goal... you must have done something to create that friend years earlier. Everyone reading this book has a few good friends. But, ask yourself honestly... how big is your black book? How many people can you get on the phone and have instant sincere trust and rapport? It is my belief that the larger number of people that you can put into your black book, the larger your emotional and financial bank account will become. Investing in relationships is a sound invest - ment. Some people seem to naturally make friends easier than others. Good sales people have mastered the art of developing quick rap - port with total strangers. Sales people are traditionally one of the highest paid positions in any organization. This statistic alone should tell you the value of understanding and relating to people. In the early 1970's my father, Curtis Baggett, worked as a finan - cial planner for a company called IDS. At just 35 years old, he con - sistently sold more insurance, mutual funds and financial services than any other salesperson in the company. He has often relayed the real reason he became an entrepreneur. He said, \"Most of the time I worked for IDS, I earned more money than the vice president earned. For some reason, he felt threatened by a young salesperson out-earning him. He didn't want me to earn more. Jealousy, I guess. So, he kept reassigning me to the worst territories so my income would drop. But, like clockwork, I would build that sales team to #1 in the nation. Eventually I got tired of working against my own company and started my own.\" 308 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"occur when people have no rapport. Y ou can now take conscious control of what many people call \"chemistry.\" The applications of this in a romantic setting are obvious. Instead of waiting around for the one person in a million that turns your motor - you can push the emotional buttons, and ignite a relationship with yourself and that person. My first book, The Secrets to Making Love Happen , and the audio course, The Secrets To Creating Chemistr y , are very thorough resources to apply these techniques to romance if that is your out - come. In addition, you can use these same skills in you interperson - al relationships, with your family, with co-workers, and with total strangers. What I’m offering you here is the ability to truly connect with people on their level so you can understand each other fully . People will thank you for making them feel so understood. I T FEELS LIKE WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON Y ou already know the secret of gaining rapport with people. Y ou do it all the time. When you first meet someone at a party, what do you do? Y ou both ask a series of questions until you find some - thing in common. Right? As soon as you find something in com - mon, you feel a sense of connection. If you discover that you grew up in the same town or went to the same college, you experience some commonality . Y ou look for clothes in common, people you both know, and even movies you like. The more things in common you find, the more comfortable you begin to feel with this person. And you’ll notice the more \"chemistry\" develops. There is a basic rule for all rapport. The more similarity - the more rapport. The more difference you have - the harder it is to maintain rapport. Rapport simply means the ability to enter someone else's world, make them feel you understand them so that you both feel a strong common bond. It is the ability to go from your map of the world into their map of the world. Rapport is the essence of successful 311 Chapter 13- The Secret Power of Rapport just doing it naturally. Some of the definitions didn't even exist until the late 1970's when Richard Bandler and John Grinder pioneered the field of NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming.) T erms like \"matching, mirroring, pacing, and leading\" are commonplace in communication workshops, dating books, and sales training world - wide today . As much as they have been absorbed into the training and self-help community, I am still shocked at the profound value these \"rapport skills\" have on the vast number of participants in my live seminars. Even if you are a social butterfly, take a few minutes to really memorize and practice this set of rapport tools. Y ou will be shocked at both the simplicity and effectiveness of doing a few things differently . Y ou will notice people, even the most difficult people, will begin to treat you as if you were their best friend. T HE S ECRET OF R APPOR T Think about a time when you just instantly clicked with another person. Think about someone whom you feel like you've known for years. Go back to that time and imagine being completely in sync with them. It might have been a family member, a friend, or some - one you just met. Go back to that time and think about what it was about that person that made you feel so attuned. Chances are you felt you were alike because you lived in the same towns, liked the same movies, held the same beliefs, or even had similar patterns of speech. Whatever the reasons that came to you for the sense of warmth you felt is based on the concept of rapport. Most people can't put their finger on why they like someone or why they do not. Most people just have a \"good feeling\" about someone or an \"awkward or creepy feeling.\" This is why most peo - ple feel so helpless in the dating scene. They are just rolling the dice with hopes that someone happens to be a match. The good news is researchers have discovered specific process - es that occur when people are in rapport and different processes that 310 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"When you are \"in rapport,\" you are experiencing similar emo - tions as the other person. Positive emotions are what make people want to trust you, like you, love you, and even listen to you. Because emotions are chemical processes that occur in our physical bodies, it makes sense that we can then influence other's emotions through the medium of our physical senses. The simple art of \"mirroring\" or \"matching\" another person might seem silly or simplistic. Actually, this is one the most power - ful tools for creating instant and long lasting rapport you will ever learn. Ever since I learned the art of mirroring and matching at age 19, my ability to get along with people has improved ten fold. I still use these skills in every telephone call I make, every radio show I appear on, and in every person-to-person meeting I have. Naturally , since these skills works so well in business, I use them to make my relationships smoother as well. Once you feel the results for your - self, you will keep these tools within arms reach whenever you are interacting with other people for the rest of your life. They are that powerful. T HE AR T OF MIRRORING Can you remember those hilarious black and white comedy slapstick movies filmed in the 1940's starring the Marx Brothers? Remember Groucho, Harpo and Chico? I vividly remember a scene where one of the brothers pretends to be looking into a full-length mirror and the other brother is facing him (from inside the mirror). Obviously, there is no glass in the mirror and the other brother mimics every move he makes. He moves his arms fast, slow , dances, whistles, spins around, etc. This \"mirror\" image is why they call gaining rapport through matching someone's physical move - ments \"mirroring.\" T echnically, the word \"matching\" is the same thing, but you would move the same arm as your partner, instead of the opposite arm. The technical differences between the two terms 313 Chapter 13- The Secret Power of Rapport communication. The downfall to simple conversational skills is that all the rap - port is based on \"content\" of the conversation. That may be useful at a party, but not in a negotiating session with an adversary. How do you make people like you when the \"content\" is an issue? The answer lies in the other ways that we communicate. If you have ever been in a romantic relationship, you don't need to be told in words when your spouse is having a bad day . Y ou can read it on their face. Imagine saying, \"Hi Honey, is something wrong?\" Y our spouse growls back, \"No. I'm fine.\" She falls down into the couch with her arms crossed and a frown distorting her face. Y ou don't simply say, \"Great! What's on TV?\" Y ou uncon - sciously sense that your spouse is in a bad mood. Even though the \"content\" of her sentence said she was fine, you know differently . The reason you know your spouse’s emotional state is because we are masterful communicators even without choosing the right words. Even my cat makes it abundantly clear when he wants to go outside or needs some more water. He can't talk - but he communi - cates. W e communicate with both our bodies (physiology & body lan - guage) and our voice (word inflections, word choices, and tone of voice). Studies reveal that the most effective tool is the use of our physical bodies in communicating what we really mean. That means the crossed arms and the pouty face speaks more truth than the words \"I'm fine.\" Furthermore, the way someone says, \"I'm fine,\" speaks more truth than the word choices alone. Y ou must listen to the intonation, inflection, volume, pitch and even rhythm. All these things you already know intuitively . Y ou just might not have ever separated the various aspects of communication into such finite detail. When you begin to recognize the different parts of communi - cation, you can then adjust your own style to be more effective. 312 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"instance, if you tilt your head, your partner should tilt his head. If he/she lifts his foot, your partner should mirror that. And so on. Y our job is to simply follow the other person's lead. After doing this for a few minutes, you will find yourself feeling connected to the other person. In a seminar, the results are often comical and silly . Even though both partners know what the purpose is something interesting invariably happens. The two partners like each other much more than they did before the exercise. Even when exchang - ing no words, people feel a sense of connection with each other . I challenge you to mirror someone's body positions today . The most common concern about using this rapport tool is that the other person will catch you and think you are mimicking them. This will not happen. In fact, most people are so self-absorbed, they won't even notice your movements at a conscious level. Y ou will be sur - prised at the number of times people will simply say things like, \"I know we just met, but it seems like I've known you for years.\" Y ou don't have to just use your body to mirror someone. I was forced to master the art of matching someone's voice when I started appearing on radio shows by telephone. Out of the 1300 radio inter - views I have been featured on, I would guess over 1,100 of those have been by telephone. Because of this fact, I was essentially handicapped from using my body language to create rapport with my audience or the host. It didn't matter what I was wearing or what I looked like. I was forced to learn how to adapt my voice alone to meet the various criteria of all three types of people. I often spoke fast, slow, loud, soft, etc. I was often the host's favorite guest, because I sounded just like him. Because I grew up in T exas, my natural speaking voice contained a slight southern accent. I learned very quickly that New Y orker's don't care much for a slow talking T exan. Therefore, I would turn my accent on and off depending on which part of the country the radio show was airing in. People occa - sionally ask me why I don't have an accent. I simply tell them it was costing me friends and money, so I \"got rid of it.\" 315 Chapter 13- The Secret Power of Rapport are really unimportant. In my mind, they are interchangeable words. In a nutshell, you move just like the person you are talking to moves. Y ou sit like them, stand like them, hold the same postures, breathe the same. When people first try this concept, they feel self-conscious. They confuse mirroring with mimicking. In my mind, mimicking is what younger siblings do to their older siblings in order to irritate them. Mimicking is copying to the point of being obnoxious. On the contrary, mirroring is the subtle art of matching the body position of the person you are talking to. If she leans back, you lean back. If she puts here left hand on her hip, you put your hand on your hip. If she laughs, you laugh. If she talks really fast, so do you. When researchers have studied couples in love or two business people experiencing a deep state of rapport - mirroring occurs natu - rally . There is evidence that when two people are in deep levels of rapport, the rhythm of their breathing are strikingly similar. It is common to see their body postures exactly alike. They even speak with the same volume and cadence. The next time you are at a restaurant, notice the way people are sitting across from each other . When in deep rapport, you will notice both people are leaning for - ward together or leaning back together . Y ou might even notice that their hands are resting in the exact same position. They don’t even realize they are matching and mirroring one another, because most of rapport is on an unconscious level. So when you match and mir - ror people, they won’t notice you doing it. What they will notice is that they suddenly like you more and feel very comfortable with you. T ry this simple experiment. Choose someone as a test subject (preferably someone you don’t know) and move your body in the same direction, manner, and movements as they do. During live seminars, we have partners stand facing each other face-to-face in order to match and mirror each other ’ s body movements. For 314 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Effective communication is the ability to create rapport by matching as many of these \"channels\" as possible. If you think about one of your best friends, it is likely, you both utilize the same primary channel to tell stories and share information. Personally, I speak very fast and tend to move my hands a lot when I speak. This style is indicative of someone who functions primarily from a visual channel. That's true. I tend to see images in my head before I start to communicate. Because I am so visual, I even talk on the phone using visual word choices. I often say, \"I can see what you are say - ing. I'm picturing it this way. It's not clear.\" These words are clues to the people who I am talking to that I really like using my visual channel. If they want instant rapport with me, they can do two sim - ple things. First, they can speed up the pace of their speech to match my fast talking style. Second, they can choose words that have a visual reference. It doesn't matter what the content of the conversa - tion will be. If they speak using these two techniques, I will uncon - sciously like this person more. And I will understand their commu - nication much quicker . I've been aware of these techniques for over a decade and they still work on me. This is how we are programmed. Just because I am aware of my programming doesn't change the fact I build rap - port faster and more naturally with people who communicate in my primary channel. I invite you to match me. As a professional speaker and writer, I am extremely aware that my audience may not prefer the visual channel as much as I do. Therefore, you will see me intentionally write using words that inflect a more auditory meaning or a more kinesthetic meaning. These words allow my reader to \"feel more in tune\" with me. The words are like serving the same dinner on a paper plate or fine china. The food could be exactly the same, but depending on your cultural upbringing, you would be completely at home with the right plate or feel totally alienated by the wrong plate. I know peo - ple who would rather starve than eat off a paper plate. So, if you try 317 Chapter 13- The Secret Power of Rapport T HE S ECRET W ORLD OF R EPRESENT A TIONAL S YSTEMS What researchers have found is that there are three major repre - sentational systems that we use to communicate. NLP refers to these channels as the V isual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic channels. V isual refers to anything you can see or visualize in your mind. Auditory includes all things that you can hear or any sounds that you create, including voices inside your mind. And of course, the Kinesthetic channel is the part of you that feels things using your body or emo - tions. Actually, there are two other channels (smell and taste.) However, I'm not going to discuss these two other systems in detail, because they don't apply to this conversation about influence and rapport as much as the other three. The Five Representational Systems 1. V isual See 2. Auditor y Hear 3. Kinesthetic Feel 4. Gustator y T aste 5. Olfactor y Smell Many people communicate primarily using just one representa - tional system. All of us have experience using all three. If you think about these channels as different ways to receive information, they are easy to memorize. Imagine the visual channel as a movie screen or TV set on with the volume turned down. Imagine the auditory channel as the telephone or stereo speakers. Finally, imagine the kinesthetic channel as a Braille book, a feeling in the heart, or a big hug from a friend. Y ou use all three of these channels to give and receive information. The one you are most comfortable with is your primary channel. Master communicators use all three channels in balance. 316 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"in our natural communication style, we didn't have automatic rap - port.

If you are a telephone sales person soliciting people at their work, you usually have to pace them into talking to you. If a busy real estate agent answers the phone out of breath sounding terribly busy, you must enter her world. I would say something like this in a clear, fast, rapid, speaking voice, \"Beth, you sound so busy! Can you squeeze one minute to answer a quick question?\" If she says, \"Yes. But only a minute.\" I then must match her fast-pace voice for about fifteen seconds before I stop speaking, take a deep breath, and hope she follows my lead. In order for Beth to feel I respect her and connect with her in her manic busy state of mind, I have to meet her on her turf. Then, after I have matched her world, I can lead her into my world. Even if I were able to establish rapport with Beth in under one minute, I would then tell her my sixty seconds was up and ask her for a few more minutes. Otherwise, I would offer to call her at another time. If I offer to hang up after one minute, she feels respected and she already knows I can talk fast. If she liked me in that first sixty seconds, it is likely she will want to hear what I have to say. It may be tough to gain rapport over the telephone in under sixty seconds, but it is great practice. T ruthfully, people make judg - ments about you everyday in less time than that. Using just your voice inflections, speed, and volume are all you need to master tele - phone relationships. I am still amazed at the number of cold-calls I get at my office that do not even attempt to gain rapport with me. I'm wondering if these people just aren't trained well or just hate their job? No rapport, no sale. No rapport, no influence. No rapport, no relationship. After people test these simple rapport tools, they are amazed. However, there is always one person in the audience who has a problem with using them. They say something like this, \"I don't feel comfortable manipulating people with these techniques. If people don't like me for who I am, then I don't think it was meant to be.\" I sit. I listen. And I resist my urge to say something sarcastic. That 321 Chapter 13- The Secret Power of Rapport H OW TO PUT IT ALL T OGETHER If the essence of rapport is sameness, then the overriding princi - ple is to become the same as the person you are talking to. There is an animal in the reptile family called a chameleon. This little crea - ture's strength is not speed, strength, or intelligence. The chameleon has the ability to change its skin color to blend into its own sur - roundings. Y ou must be a chameleon. One of greatest benefits of being able to create warm and fuzzy states in others is they begin to listen to you. Before you can effec - tively influence anyone, you must first gain rapport. As soon as you have this emotional connection, you can begin leading them to your way of thinking. The most interesting experiment you can do for yourself is lead someone using your posture. Find someone to mir - ror that is totally unaware of the fact you are going to mirror them. Once you have mirrored their posture, leg positions, arm positions, and even head position - start changing. In other words, you move your leg and see if his will follow . Y ou will be surprised at how easy it is to get people to follow your lead. Likewise, once you establish rapport on this level, you can lead them to your opinion, idea, or toward your product or service. Rapport is the beginning point of all effective persuasion. I once mirrored a CEO while he was sitting behind his big mahogany desk. After gaining rapport, I crossed my legs in my chair. Less than thirty seconds later, I heard a \"thump\" under his desk. He had unconsciously tried to cross his legs under the desk. He was following my lead and he didn't even realize it. Y ou can pace or lead people in a variety of contexts. If they are tapping their finger on the desk, you can move your finger in the same rhythm. If they are blinking their eyes rapidly, you can blink your eyes at the same pace.

Alex holds onto the pipe dream that there is one woman out there who will just effortlessly \"click\" with him and love him \"just the way he is.\" He doesn't believe he needs to change anything about himself. I am in no position to say whether his dream woman exists or not. Because Alex is 43 and has never had a relationship last more than six months, it seems to me his strategy for life-long romance is not working. It would behoove him to start changing himself because \"who he is\" is repelling all the women he dates. Likewise, if your ability to instantly connect and create long lasting rapport with people is drastically underdeveloped, you owe it to your future friends to learn the skills.

Not only did my dad understand that specific words affect our mental pictures, but he understood words are a powerful programming factor in lifelong success. One particularly interesting event occurred when I was eight. As a kid, I was always climbing trees, poles, and literally hanging around upside down from the rafters of our lake house. So, it came to no surprise for my dad to find me at the top of a 30-foot tree swinging back and forth. My little eight-year-old brain didn't realize the tree could break or I could get hurt. I just thought it was fun to be up so high. My older cousin, T ammy, was also in the same tree. She was hanging on the first big limb, about ten feet below me. T ammy's mother also noticed us at the exact same time my dad did. About that time a huge gust of wind came over the tree. I could hear the leaves start to rattle and the tree begin to sway. I remember my dad's voice over the wind yell, \"Bart, Hold on tightly.\" So I did. The next thing I know, I heard T ammy screaming at the top of her lungs, laying flat on the ground. She had fallen out of the tree. I scampered down the tree to safety. My dad later told me why she fell and I did not. Apparently , T ammy's mother was not as an astute student of language as my father . When T ammy’s mother felt the gust of wind, she yelled out, \"Tammy, don't fall!\" And T ammy did... fall. My dad then explained to me that the mind has a very difficult time processing a negative image. In fact, people who rely on inter - 325"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"drop the pencil. Now please do it again.\" Most people then pick up the pencil and pretend to be in excru - ciating pain while their hand tries but fails to drop the pencil. The point is made. If you tell your brain you will \"give it a try,\" you are actually telling your brain to fail. I have a \"no try\" rule in my house and with everyone I interact with. Either people will do it or they won't. Either they will be at the party or they won't. I'm brutal when peo - ple attempt to lie to me by using the word try. Do they think I don't know they are really telegraphing to the world they have no inten - tion of doing it but they want me to give them brownie points for pretended effort? Y ou will never hear the words \"I'll try\" come out of my mouth unless I'm teaching this concept in a seminar . If you \"try\" and do something, your unconscious mind has per - mission not to succeed. If I truly can't make a decision I will tell the truth. \"Sorry John. I'm not sure if I will be at your party or not. I've got an outstanding commitment. If that falls through, I will be here. Otherwise, I will not. Thanks for the invite.\" People respect honesty . So remove the word \"try\" from your vocabulary . My dad also told me that psychologists claim it takes seventeen positive statements to offset one negative statement. I have no idea if it is true, but the logic holds true. It might take up to seventeen compliments to offset the emotional damage of one harsh criticism. These are concepts that are especially useful when raising children. Ask yourself how many compliments you give yourself daily versus how many criticisms. Heck, I know you are talking to yourself all day long. W e all have internal voices that give us direction. So, are you giving yourself the 17:1 ratio or are you shortchanging yourself with toxic self-talk like, \"I suck. I'm fat. Nobody will like me. I'll try this diet. I'm not good enough. I'm so stupid. I'm broke, etc. etc.\" If our parents can set a lifetime of programming with one wrong statement, imagine the kind of programming you are doing on a daily basis with your own internal dialogue. 327 Chapter 14- Toxic Vocabulary nal pictures cannot see a negative at all. In order for T ammy to process the command of not falling, her nine-year-old brain had to first imagine falling, then try to tell the brain not to do what it just imagined. Whereas, my eight-year-old brain instantly had an inter - nal image of me hanging on tightly . This is why people who try to stop smoking struggle with the act of stopping smoking. They are running pictures all day of themselves smoking. Smokers are rarely taught to see themselves breathing fresh air and feeling great. The language itself becomes one barrier to success. This concept is especially useful when you are attempting to break a habit or set a goal. Y ou can't visualize not doing something. The only way to properly visualize not doing something is to actual - ly find a word for what you want to do and visualize that. For example, when I was thirteen years old, I played for my junior high school football team. I tried so hard to be good, but I just couldn't get it together at that age. I remember hearing the words run through my head as I was running out for a pass, \"Don't drop it!\" Naturally, I dropped the ball. My coaches were not skilled enough to teach us proper \"self-talk.\" They just thought some kids could catch and others couldn't. I'll never make it pro, but I'm now a pret - ty good Sunday afternoon football player, because all my internal dialogue is positive and encourages me to win. I wish my dad had coached me playing football instead of just climbing trees. I might have had a longer football career . Here is a very easy demonstration to teach your kids and your friends the power of a toxic vocabulary . Ask them to hold a pen or pencil. Hand it to them. Now, follow my instructions carefully .

In the sport of soccer , you might remember Pele's trademark scissor-kick where he falls to his back, upside down, swinging his legs over his head and torpedoes the soccer ball into the corner of the net. W e all love those winning plays. But, if you talk to any professional coach or athlete, they will tell you those plays are only possible when and if the player has mastered the \"fundamentals.\" As children, we prac - tice mimicking our heroes only to wonder why we are never as effective as they are. I used to watch Chinese Martial Arts movies and run around the house karate chopping the curtains. W ithout the fundamentals, you simply can't achieve mastery . As an adult, I took three years of Kung Fu from Master Edward Song. Many times dur - ing the first year I was tempted to quit because learning the funda - mentals was often arduous, tedious, and boring. I later found out that Master Song still practices every single move - every basic move- once a week. He realizes the power of mastering the funda - mentals. He told me the reason more people don't complete their training to become a \"black belt\" is most people do not have the discipline to master the fundamentals. This holds true for profes - sional athletes, salespeople and musicians. 333"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"335 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s 334 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy This chapter is designed to reveal the fundamentals of getting rich. Before I discuss these basic 2000-year-old truths, ask yourself this question, \"Am I willing to master the fundamentals - no matter how boring, tedious, or risky they might seem?\" If you aren't will - ing to follow the proven route, what's the use in even reading the map? Are you willing to get past a silly childhood belief that said, \"I'm not good at math,\" in order to grasp an essential element of money? W arning... there may be a spreadsheet in this chapter! Are you willing to read this entire chapter twice? Are you willing to analyze every chart and really study every graph? Okay, if you are committed... read on. When I was a teenager, Dad gave me a book called The Richest Man in Babylon . This easy to read story of an ancient metalworker contains as many applicable money truths as any of today's best sellers. The main character , Arkad, found himself working in the proverbial \"rat race.\" He worked long hours bending metal to make shields and weapons. It was a respectable middle class job in the thriving city of Babylon. Like many of you reading this book, he barely made ends meet and wondered how to ever get ahead. The story goes onto reveal how he formed a relationship with the wealthiest man in Babylon and learned his secrets. The reason this little book made such an impact on me is that I was too young to appreciate it. In other words, I read the words, but I didn't get the meaning. I didn't follow the advice and it cost me. The first ancient principal shared by the rich wise man was this: \"Pay yourself first.\" Pay yourself first applies to many areas of your financial life. For example, if you learn the simple habit of saving at least 10% of every dollar you make, you will quickly be sitting on a small nest egg of cash. This may sound difficult, but every one I know who has committed to paying themselves first had this surprising reac - tion, \"I didn't really miss the money at all.\" This is a tip you can use Universal Truth # 18 Pay yourself first."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"337 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s 336 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy no matter how much money you are earning. Most people spend wasteful money on sodas, cigarettes, or even $3 cups of coffee at Starbucks. They don't stop to think what that $1 or $2 a day could grow into in 20 years. Many people feel buying weekly lottery tick - ets is their retirement plan. It's a great plan only if you want to retire flat broke. Research indicates that the one single behavior that poor people frequently do and rich people rarely do is play the lottery . There is an undeniable statistical inverse correlation between your net worth and playing the lottery. In my opinion, lottery is a tax on people who are very bad at math. (1 in 40 million are not odds I want to take.) I recently read about a school bus driver who saved just $3 a day and retired with over 3 million dollars in assets, because he was willing to live below his means. Can you say no to lottery tickets and dessert? See the spreadsheet on the next page labeled Spreadsheet 15-1 busdriver .

The book also goes on to explain that even though all of the millionaires in the study could afford a bigger house, a newer car, or more expensive jewel - ry, they didn't choose to spend their money there. It was these same fundamental habits that got them to the place of a balance sheet over a million dollars. They save a portion of every dollar earned and live below their means. Eventually, they are worth so much money they do buy luxuries. Those luxuries are still below their new means. Actually, when I say \"save,\" I actually mean \"invest.\" They do spend a portion of income on living expenses, entertainment, or miscellaneous goods. A small portion of every paycheck is ear - marked for a pool of money that earns more money. Depositing your \"nest egg\" money into the savings account at the bank earning just 4% interest is about as stupid as letting your brother-in-law invest it in that restaurant bar scheme! However, it is smarter than leaving it under your mattress. But, with just a bit higher risk and a bit of financial education, you can earn ten times the amount of profit using the power of compound interest. The secret to how the school bus driver turned that $3 per day into $3 million is in the second piece of wisdom. The bus driver spent those boring hours while the kids were at school studying investments, stocks, and financial strategies. He wasn't any smarter than the other bus drivers. He was more disci - plined and more educated than the other guys. The main difference was he was willing to learn how to make his small savings grow and grow and grow . While the other bus drivers played cards and watched TV, he became rich (slowly).

(Work with me here. Imagine they are adopted if the thought of pig ranching is beneath you.) On their 20th birthday, you make them a very simple offer . Y ou will invest to get them started in the pig ranching business. Y ou tell them very clearly that this is a simple contest. The kid with the most pigs bred and living on their ranch on their 40th birthday inherits your entire 10 million dollar estate. T HE RULES ARE AS FOLLOWS : Y ou will give them both a ranch of equal size, the same amount of money, and four pigs each to start with. Each year, you will give them four more pigs to add to their stock. They can't buy more pigs from outside. They must breed them. So, the contest begins. The first few years go along smoothly. Each kid happily gets four new pigs every year and the pigs do what pigs do. They eat, play in the mud, and mate, creating lots of little piglets. Each kid is up to about 35 animals when Jack decides he wants a new car. So, he sells five of his pigs and drives a shiny new car into town and impresses all his girlfriends. Jill smiles and continues to drive her two-year-old car that she purchased for less than two pigs in a trade with a neighbor. She hated to spend her savings on a car, but it was an emergency.

T HE P OWER OF C OMPOUND I NTEREST If the bus driver would have only mastered the fundamental habit of saving 10% of his income, he might have had around $118,036 of cash for his retirement. (This is if he had kept his cash in a savings account at his local bank and earned the traditional 4% compounded interest.) By the way, if he had kept that cash under his mattress for twenty years, he would only have $65,003 for his retirement. Just the act of earning a meager 4% a year in a no risk savings back almost doubled his savings. What the bus driver did was he mastered another principle: compound interest. If the bus driver had invested his 10% monthly savings into the typical mutual fund during 1969-1999. He would have retired with over 2.2 million dollars! Now, because the bus driver actually played the stock market and his money performed better than the average mutual fund, he earned over $3 million dollars. Do you see the secret power of compound interest? The concept of compound interest can be illustrated many ways. I find I learn best when people let me see visual examples. If you learn better when you see, hear, feel and touch... you are not alone. A spreadsheet is about the least entertaining teaching prop ever invented. Play along with this story and you will get it. Imagine you have two twin kids, Jack and Jill, who grow up"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"use to avoid taxes: corporations. The corporation is an amazing invention that gives you back control of your cash flow. Let me explain. Most poor and middle income earners are working too hard for wages to ever imagine having time to run a successful corpora - tion or even a small business. There is no law that says you have to be successful. In fact, many small businesses and corporations go four or five years without ever turning a profit. Y ou may be asking, \"Are you recommending we start a busi - ness that loses money? That would leave me with even less money than I started with!\" Nope. Y our math is bad. What I am suggesting is that you KEEP YOUR MONEY out of the hands of the govern - ment as long as legally possible. Y ou see corporations have a differ - ent set of tax laws than individuals. Did you know that corporations pay about the same percentage of tax as you do... but they pay it only on NET INCOME. Net income is the money left over after you’ve paid out all your business expenses. In other words, if a corporation earns $100,000 from one client and spends $100,000 on rent, labor, and expenses, the government gets to tax the difference between those two figures: $100,000 income <$100,000> expenses $0 Net Profit 33% tax on $0 = $0 taxes owed. Pay tax on your net income, not your gross income. This is such an important concept to start applying immediately . Y ou must learn to earn more money on your savings and have more money to live on. Y ou can accomplish both these things by paying yourself first and paying the government last. This is more difficult 343 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s fast. Jill jokes it is pig V iagra, but she likes the result. More pigs. A year later the drug is recalled and pig production goes back to normal. As the years go by, Jill's stock of pigs get so large, she has to expand the ranch a few acres. T ruthfully, she wonders if it was worth all the trouble. Since she became a vegetarian for health rea - sons people think she is really weird being a pig rancher! By the fif - teenth year, it becomes clear Jill is going to win. She has over ten times the number of pigs. Jack scratches his big sagging-over-the- belt belly in confusion. He asks, \"How could a few pigs taken here and there make that much difference?\" As his skinny sister stares at her overweight twin brother, she explaines the power of compound interest. After a blank look came over his face when she used math, she tries the brutal approach. Look at your belly. Do you think one slice of bacon did that? No. It was one slice of bacon, every day, for 15 years. Y ou were making your belly fat simultaneously making your wallet thin, one slice at a time. Y ou have heard of the goose that lays the golden egg, haven't you? W ell, you ate the pigs that bred 10 million dollars. On Jack’s 45th birthday, Jill gladly pays his medical bill for the triple bypass surgery on Jack’s heart. She is a good sis - ter. Jack isn't a stupid fellow. He just doesn't understand the power of compound interest, and he lets a few bad habits ruin his physical and financial health. The other application of paying yourself first has to do with tax - ation. In most western countries, an individual is taxed between 25%-60% of their income depending on how much money they make. W ithout discussing the fairness of this policy or not, one can clearly see that giving your money away to the government is like giving away two pigs a year...with no benefits! Therefore, it is high - ly recommended you educate yourself on how to legally pay less taxes. Right now, I'll reveal to you the number one method rich people 342 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"is nearly impossible to build wealth, when you give it all to the gov - ernment. So when I tell you to look for ways to avoid paying lots of taxes, what I’m saying is pay as little taxes as legally possible and no more. Put the rest of your money in places that are legally acceptable to the government. That’s how the rich people keep most of the money they earn. Y ou can keep most of your money too, if you are open and willing to learn new ways of managing your money .

Rather than fight them, join them. Y ou see, as an employee, you pay the government its money first. In America, the employer is required by law to deduct the expected amount of taxes out of your paycheck and send it to the government for safekeeping. Those lawmakers in W ashington know the average person would spend every penny and have none left to pay their taxes when April 15th rolled around. They are right about most people, but not about you. Y ou have discipline and you know the law . Y our mission is to keep your money and let it grow using smart investing as long as you possibly can.

(Imagine Jack loaning out his best pig nine months out of the year. She can't have piglets, if she ain't here.) Y ou can't earn interest on money that you don't have. What if there was a legal way to pay the same 33% tax on less money than you actually earned? This concept is called tax deductions. If you own a small home 345 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s to pull of working as someone else's employee than working for your own company/ being self-employed. Y ou must get creative and find a legal way . There are many paths to the same goal. For many Americans, the first step to financial freedom is turning in your employee badge and starting a career of self-employment. Now, I want to make one thing clear. I do believe it is appropri - ate to pay some taxes to the government. There are many great gov - ernment funded institutions that benefit society as a whole, like hav - ing police officers on the street, a strong military, paying teachers to educate our children and paying construction workers to build better roads. All these come out of our tax contributions. However, if you are not careful, you can become so heavily taxed that you will feel like you can never get ahead. This is because the government, with all its good intentions, will suck more than its fair share of money right out of your wallet. Think about it. When you get a paycheck, the government pulls out a considerable chunk for income taxes, social security and welfare. So, you worked all those long hours and only got a portion of what you earned. Then you take that leftover money and go buy stuff: car, food, clothes, toys, computer, etc. And you will notice that nearly every time you pay retail for something, you pay an additional sales tax. Guess who gets that? Da govern - ment. Then if you live in certain states in the U.S.A., you might pay an additional state income tax. Who gets more of your money? Da government. Then if you’re buying a home, you pay a property tax to fund the schools. That’s an additional tax you pay after your pay - check has been deducted for income tax, state tax and sales tax. The government, designed to work in your best interest, even taxes you when you die. In order for your heirs to receive the house, car and stuff you left them, they often have to pay a probate tax. And it’ s pretty hefty. So my point is this. If you only work for a living with - out putting your money into any tax exempt investments, you will find that most of your hard-earned money goes to the government. If you do that all your life, you will feel financially stuck, because it 344 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"based business, you automatically qualify for up to 30 deductions you didn't have before.

If you can't think of anything to do, just sign up as an independent dis - tributor for some multi-level marketing company and begin taking deductions today. (See some low start-up cost, home-based busi - nesses at Bartbaggett.com/business.) The more legal deductions you have, the more of your money you get to keep. And I highly recommend getting a good tax attor - ney and especially a tax accountant to figure your taxes at the end of the year . A tax accountant knows all the new tax deductions (and they change yearly). He knows what the government will let you get away with and what will raise a \"red flag\" and make the IRS suspicious. Rich people have tax experts on hand to ask advice and keep them paying the least amount in taxes while acting within the tax codes. If you are ready to act like the rich people, then it’s time you surround yourself with some tax experts. They are worth the investment. If they are good, they will save you more money each year in taxes than they will cost to hire them.

Edward is a very successful Internet consultant for X-Corporation. He routinely earns $60,000 per year working in the Internet Division. He noticed that even though he was making $60,000 per year, 33% of it was going to taxes. That’s $19,800 of his hard earned money . This frustrated him because such a huge chunk was getting deducted before he ever got his paycheck.

Does that bother you? If you really think you own something free and clear, think again. Don't pay your property tax and see who really controls your prop - erty. (The government does). Ownership is really just paper permis - sion to occupy the premises. If a war breaks out you will quickly see who can roll their tanks through your yard. Begin focusing on \"controlling\" the things you want, not necessarily \"owning\" them. Did you know you could own 100% of a corporation stock and that still doesn't mean you own your house? Even if you lose a lawsuit, the creditor can't just take the house. The creditor would have to take control of your stock, take control of the company, then try to get your house. Corporations can provide valuable protection from lecherous lawyers, creditors, and pissed off ex-spouses. Y ou never want to expect those negative things will actually happen, but it is wise to set up your financial house so one natural disaster doesn't wipe out the whole pig ranch. So far I've talked about four key principles that RICH live by and the poor do not: 1. Pay Y ourself First. 2. Live below your means. Invest 10% of every dollar into your future.

Then one day he met a friend, Judy, who was also an Internet consultant making $75,000 per year. Only Judy was self- employed and ran her client fees through a corporation she had formed. She showed Edward on paper how her clients paid checks directly to her company . This was her \"gross\" income. Judy then deducted all the business expenses she could legally deduct: partial rent of her home office, laptop computer, cell phone, company car , postage, business lunches, etc. Then after she had subtracted her expenses, what was left over was her \"net\" income. For an entire year, Judy received the sum total of $60,000. She deducted $24,000 worth of expenses. That left her a net income of $36,000. At the end of the year she paid 33% ($11, 880) to the IRS. Interesting. Edward had earned the exact same $60,000, but he paid $19,800 to the IRS. In other words, he paid $8,250 more than Judy to the government. Now, imagine how quickly he could have grown his wealth, had Edward had an additional $8,250 0 to invest. W ell, as the story goes, Edward quit his job and for less than $500 incorporated him - self. And now he’s watching his money grow, because he gets to keep more and more of it each year . The bottom line is this: If Edward had stayed at his job, he would have had little after-tax money left over to build for a solid retirement. Now, if he keeps earning at least $60,000 through his corporation for 20 years, that $8,250 tax savings would become over $1.8 million compounded at 20% per year . If you are an employee, the government tax system is stealing your retirement. So what are you going to do about it? Naturally, Edward found his own way to work within the tax laws. Edward didn't even have to quit the career he loved. He just changed the way he made money for the same services. I don't know how you are going to start paying yourself first.

Can you tell me if a $30,000 payment goes in the credit or debit column? The answer to all of the above questions is ... both answers are correct depending on who's paperwork you are looking at. T o the landlord, the house payment is income. T o the renter, the same pay - ment is an expense. A car is an asset on your balance sheet, but it costs you money every month. Hmmm. A $30,000 payment goes into the credit column if you are getting it, debit column if you are writing the check. So, how do you keep up? Leaning on Robert Kiyosaki's rich dad's wisdom, I’ve adopted entirely new definitions of assets and liabilities. His rich dad said, \"An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.\" Remember, rich people buy assets. Poor and middle class peo - ple buy liabilities, and they think they are assets. A perfect example is the car in your own driveway . Y ou might think that is an asset. But, using Kiyosaki's definition, it is a liability.

Before you jump to conclusions about my dear stepfather , T ex, the story doesn't end there. A few years later , T ex surprised me with an envelope full of cash. He felt responsible for my savings, so he has paid me back every penny out of his own pocket. Y es, he dou - bled my initial amount. T o this day, I deeply appreciate the integrity and responsibility he took. And, he didn't have to pay me back. I made the investment decisions. I took responsibility that I lost the money. I learned three lessons in one: integrity, compassion, and financial risk. Key Principle: Choose your advisors carefully . Before I wrap up this brief and incomplete discussion on invest - ments, there is one more key concept I must cover: Assets. What is an asset? When studying for my business degree at Pepperdine University, my accounting teachers told me very clearly what was an asset and what was a liability. However, I'm beginning to change my mind. According to my new financial hero, Robert Kiyosaki, they have it all wrong. In his book Rich Dad Poor Dad , Kiyosaki says this, \"You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is Rule #1. It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle finan - cially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability. Rich people buy assets.

Make your money work for you. Y our assets have to work for you, not against you. Money is just the form of energy that buys assets or buys liabilities. Money under your mattress is neutral. Money in a mutual fund is an asset. Money in your gas tank is a liability .

Notice that nowhere in that definition is the word job, work, career, etc. The basic model of financial abundance is not dependent on employees and employers. These two methods are really the starting point. W ork is basically exchanging your time for some amount of money . As long as you work for money, you will be somebody's employee. (If you are your own boss, you are your own employee.) The way to gain riches is to have your money go to work for you. If you are a bit confused, this diagram should solidify the point I am hammering home. As you read this today, ask yourself which of the following categories you fit best into? a. Employee b. Self-Employed c. Business Owner d. Investor 357 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s For many people, owning their own business is a giant leap in lifestyle compared to the option of working for someone else as paid labor. However, if you want to be rich, self-employment is not your outcome. It should not be your ultimate goal. If anything, self- employment is just the next step along the path to financial abun - dance. Let me explain. Remember the financial wisdom that states \"Do not work for your money, make your money work for you?\" If you simply exchange one boss for another - you are still an employee. In fact, when you start your own business, you are the worker, the boss, the accountant, the sales team, the marketing department, and the trash detail. Y ou have traded one job for six jobs. In exchange, you do get the emotional benefits of freedom, significance, variety, creativity and ownership. Also, you take back control of your tax situation. There are many other benefits, too. However, the reason over 80% of small businesses fail within the first five years in the United States is because rarely does one person have the skill or energy to fill all six roles. Y ou might make excellent widgets, but have poor skills selling them. Or you might sell lots of widgets, but you can't manage the cash flow . Small business management aside, what is the real purpose of working? I think there are two purposes: 1.) Become rich as fast as possible. 2.) Spend your day doing something that you love to do. Have passion for your career and it won't seem like work. In my humble experience, once you have reached the first goal (financial independence), finding work that fills you with passion and fulfillment is easy . The challenge for most people is finding a great paying job that meets their inner most emotional desires. Listen carefully, even if you find that great job... you are still not guaranteed wealth. Y ou might be able to create a high cash flow and a way to spend your day working a job that you love. But, you are still a few steps away from financial freedom. 356 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"book The E-Myth . In his book, Mr. Gerber outlines a very clear model for running your business by successfully replacing yourself at every job position. He illustrates clearly that as long as the busi - ness depends on you, it cannot replicate itself and be self-sufficient. Gerber explains how to grow a business from the self-employed quadrant into the business owner quadrant. I was washing my car one day at one of those self-service car washes that requires you to put in four quarters to spray wash your car. I never thought about who owned those little self-operating businesses until I saw a man dumping hundreds of quarters out of the machine into a large bucket. As I visited with him, he explained that he purchased this little car wash for less than $20,000. He spent about one day a week collecting the money . All the other duties, such as refilling the soap, cleaning the stalls, and repairing the machines, were handled by his one employee. He said he gets the money himself if he is in town. He thinks his employees are honest, but buckets of cash would be an easy temptation for anyone. As I discovered, this little car wash in my neighborhood grosses this guy about $1500 per week in income. So he invests a few hours a week in an asset that earns him a huge residual income. Here is a guy who gets the value of being a \"business owner\". This asset pays him cash. If he could only find a trustworthy person to collect the money, he would be a pure business owner and not even have to spend an hour working as an employee. All in all, he made a great business decision. There are businesses you could buy in your own neighborhood. How many car washes did you pass by this week? Start looking for assets! Remember, these quadrants are not a ladder . Y ou don't have to experience one to make the transition into the other. Most people graduate from one to the next because of cash flow restraints. Y ou can take a short cut if you make up your mind to do so. But you have to make a decision that is your outcome. 359 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s Most self-employed people assume they are business owners. They are not. If you cannot leave the country for at least one year and come back to a business that is worth more than when you left it... you are not a business owner - you are an employee. Y ou must begin to think like an \"investor\" or a \"business owner\" in order to become financially free. Don't get me wrong. Y ou can keep working as long as you find it fulfilling, but don't confuse your work with your financial purpose: acquiring assets that earn you money . Residual Income > Expenses = Financial Freedom Most people think that if they save enough money to quit their job they are free. Not true. If your assets are not paying you enough profit monthly to cover your expenses, without dipping into your cash savings, you are just on vacation between jobs. If you pour all your savings into your own business, you become self-employed with the potential for massive profit or bankruptcy. If you take the same money and buy assets, you can earn an immediate positive cash flow and move yourself into the two quadrants that the rich live in. I am not dissuading you from self- employment. As an entrepreneur, I like this life. However, I have learned self- employment is not the easiest or shortest route to wealth. Look at all the options. Most people believe that owning their own business is the shortest route to wealth. It might be for you if you become an educated business person. If you are determined to run your own business, please read Michael Gerber's 358 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy Have you ever noticed that the wealthiest people have the least amount of titles on their business card? I used to wonder why. Now I realize that because super wealthy people are not employees, they have no title. They are in the business of buying and selling assets. Those assets could be businesses, houses, stocks, etc. Because they no longer have the employee mentality, they don't have a flashy title on their business card. Less is more."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"361 Chapter 15- Fundamental Cash Flow Secr e t s D ANIEL RETIRES AT AGE 28 I know one person who took the shortcut to financial freedom starting the day after graduating college. Daniel T ibeto was a close friend of mine while we attended Pepperdine University. He knew something when he was 19 that I didn't learn until I was 29... the secret of wealth is buying assets. I spent my twenties moving slow - ly from quadrant to quadrant. Daniel spent his early twenties buying assets. He spent his late twenties in semi-retirement with his lovely wife and their new baby. Hmmm. I wonder why I didn't learn this earlier. Daniel was very clear on his intent. His only purpose from the day he graduated college was financial freedom. He knew that the only way to get financial freedom was own assets that paid him a monthly residual income. So, he basically skipped the whole job thing. He skipped the whole self-employment thing. He focused on one thing only: buying assets. For two to three straight years, he lived in a crappy apartment in Santa Monica, California existing on nothing more than peanut but - ter sandwiches and tuna fish! He drove the same 1970 yellow Karman-Gia car he owned since high school. He got up early every day and went to bed late. He and his partner were searching for real estate deals in the Los Angeles area. They knew if they found the right deal, they would have cash flow for life. After two years of missed deals, failed closings, and struggle... they signed their first deal. It was a real estate development deal that turned ugly . After a year of struggle, both Daniel and his partner lost several hundred thousand dolloars and had to get real jobs to pay off the debt. It was a big risk that didn’t pay off. However, Daniel relays that bad deal taught him to be more educated, more prudent, more calculating, and be a better investor. Daniel didn’t give up. He took a part-time job as a real estate appraiser to learn about the things he didn’ t know the first time. After another few years, he started risking his own money again. 360 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy He found a good deal on a pair of houses in Santa Monica. It wasn't a huge deal, but it created enough cash flow to look for big - ger deals. Then, disaster struck. A major earthquake totaled his one piece of property. He turned disaster into opportunity by using the insurance money and a loan to convert this old piece of property into a sixteen-unit apartment complex. This one deal still earns Daniel and his wife over $10,000 a month in residual positive cash flow . Y ou might say he got lucky because of the earthquake. Nope. Luck finds those who are prepared and ready. Or another way to put it: preparation meets opportunity. If the earthquake hadn't hit, it might have taken another three years to earn the cash or qualify for the credit to do a bigger deal. In any case, Danny would still have been retired by now if he chose not to work. The stroke of luck just speeded up the path. Daniel was clear on his outcome - buy assets and retire young. He could have just quit after the first loss. It set him back a few years. All-in-all, he still took the fast track to resid - ual income. He was willing to live below his means, sacrifice his ego, learn from his mistakes, and work toward one goal: positive cash flow. Now, it is time for you to create your own plan. Key Points: 1. A void getting stuck as an employee who earns about as much as your expenses. 2. Owning a business is different from being self-employed. If you can't leave the country for a year or more and come back to see the business is worth more than when you left - you are self- employed. 3. W ealth is created by owning assets.

Build investments that create passive income to support your living without having to work for it. The goal sounds simple, but the execution is something 90% of the world never does in real life.

Evidence is all around, but it takes a bit of faith to really grasp the whole thing. When I use the term Spirituality, I don't mean religious. The concept I am introducing will apply to any religion or anyone who has no religion. In fact, physics actually plays an important role in the theory of Prosperity. It's hard to argue with physics. Did you know that according to the laws of physics matter never actually disappears? Things are just energy in various forms of movement or non-movement. Energy can change forms. The most common example is the molecular structure H20. One part hydrogen and 2 parts oxygen is called ice when it finds itself in an environment below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. If you put the piece of ice on a warm stove it becomes liquid (water). Then, if you heat it up, it changes forms again into gas. This makes sense even to me as a guy who never took a physics course.

When you see yourself as simply a person who redirects a portion of the billions of dollars a day that flies around this planet, the job of being wealthy seems so much easier . Y ou are just a traffic cop on the highway of wealth. Now, in order to begin to \"see \" the billions of dollars that are flying around your head as we speak, you must adjust your financial vision receptors. People stuck in poverty consciousness are blind to the fact we live on a planet of total abundance. They only see scarcity . D O Y OU H A VE F INANCIAL G LAUCOMA ?

That river has been flowing since birth and you expect it to be flow - ing long after you die. If that is your reality, do you need to fight over the water with your brothers and sisters? People burdened with financial glaucoma can't see the flowing river of money all around them. In fact, poverty consciousness forces people to see only drops of water where there are buckets. Scarcity thinking feels a draught coming when there are rainstorms over the mountain. Scarcity thinking changes a happy loving river community with unlimited water resources into a miserable, thirsty, water-hoarding town of bickering siblings who fight and sue each other over buck - ets of water . When people feel scarcity of a needed resource (love, 367 Chapter 16 - The Spirituality of Prosperity ing planet we are on ... it makes sense. There is no huge trash dump where things we need anymore just go and pile up. Our planet is a living ecosystem that produces and consumes and changes forms over thousands of years. Our trash, our homes, our exhaust, and even our bodies eventually are recycled into the earth. So, if you get out of your own small body for a minute and look at the world as a whole: you realize you are just part of one big system. Y ou can fight it, but in the end you are part of the one-ness with the planet. This one-ness is the key to abundance thinking. If you have the firm belief that there are unlimited resources to take care of you, then you think, act, and speak in a very different way than if you believe in scarcity . As human beings we have an ego that creates separation from each other and the planet. Since our ego drives us to meet our basic needs (food, water, reproduction, etc.) it makes sense the ego separates us from other humans in an effort to guaran - tee we get our needs met first. The ego isn't very spiritual. So, to move beyond our basic ego needs and into prosperity conscious - ness, we must imagine the universe as a part of ourselves. When you realize that money is just a form of energy exchang - ing hands, it loses it mystery. Money is just a form of energy that some government printed on paper . These days, money isn't even printed on paper. Right now, where you sit, there are billions of dol - lars being sent through your body in the form of radio waves, TV signals, and satellite information. Even worldwide banks transfer billions of dollars nightly around the world in the form of simple electrical pulses. Y ou are already in the flow of more wealth than you could possibly spend.

Author Stuart W ilde says that our ego separates us from the flow. Most of us would always give the last sip of water or the last bite of food to our close family members. W e feel connected, so we take care of our own. In fact, just at a family picnic with baskets of food - we are generous and loving. \"No, you take the last chicken wing. Oh!

When they find themselves in a situation that requires a decision, they ask themselves what Christ would do. If they think they know the answer, they act as Christ would act. This is just another form of modeling. Buddhists do the same thing with their image of Buddha. Muslims do the same thing with their image of Mohammed. If you are attempting to stick true to a belief system, it is useful to have one individual whom you can model. When I encounter situations in which I become angry or feel oppressed, I ask myself how Gandhi would react. I act as I feel Gandhi would have and I usually feel at peace. When modeling the rich and happy, you might pick one person whom you admire and ask yourself how she or he would act. This will guide you to the right actions to take with the intent of maintaining prosperity thinking. T HE S ECRETS OF S PIRITUAL C ASH F LOW If the money is just billions of energy particles flying through the air, what does it take for you to reach out and direct your share into your pocket? T o get your turn directing the energy flow, you must get yourself into the flow . There is a simple metaphor to illus - trate this point. Imagine you are on a shoulder of a major interstate watching cars speeding by at 70 miles per hour . Y ou want to get onto the road, and you are thinking about the best strategy. Clearly , 371 Chapter 16 - The Spirituality of Prosperity systems call it Karma. Y ou get what you give. Y et when it comes to money, we feel the pressure of today is more pertinent than the Universal Law that says we will get back tomorrow what we give today . H A VE A BUNDANCE IN L OVE , T OO The same concept of abundance can be applied to other areas of your life besides finance. The term \"jealousy\" is in direct conflict with abundance thinking. Jealousy is based on a fear of loss of love. Y ou can only fear a loss of love if you think the love in question is limited and finite. If you feel love is in abundance and always flow - ing, you wouldn't feel threatened by your spouse loving another , too. I'm not suggesting it is always easy to be fearless and jealousy- free. But, because we attract the most dominant thoughts into our lives, fearing loss ... brings loss. Giving love brings love. Sharing wealth brings wealth. People who naturally live in this state of \"abundance thinking\" see the world as a place of unlimited resources. Therefore, the behavior, thoughts, and fears that rule a scarcity thinker's mind don't enter the thinker's reality. Effectively, they think differently . And, as you already know by now, thoughts do create our reality . B ELIEF S YSTEMS Think back to the chapter in which I discussed belief systems. Prosperity thinking is rooted in a few core beliefs.

Did you know a volcano blast in Hawaii can affect fish breeding in Japan? Did you know a two-degree change in the South Pole can flood beaches worldwide by a rising tide? Have you ever been on a plane sitting next to exactly the person you needed to meet? Have you ever picked up the phone and the person you were about to call was already on the line calling you? Have you ever looked down and found money right under your feet? When these things happen, you are in the flow. Some call this syn - chronicity . The best selling book The Celestine Prophecy illustrates a belief that \"There are no coincidences.\" As I stated in an earlier chapter , the belief that holds \"everything happens for a reason\" is an empowering belief that shifts you from victim-mode to cause-mode. When you put yourself at cause you regain control. Prosperity con - sciousness takes this concept beyond personal control. Prosperity consciousness actually insinuates that you give up direct control and put faith in the \"universe\" to mysteriously deliver to your doorstep what you need.

The best way to get yourself onto the highway of wealth is to crank your car up and start rolling. If you are moving too fast, you can't enter. If you are moving too slow, you will get hit from behind. The easiest way to join the flow is to match the speed of the other cars and slide right in as one of the team. Y ou must get your thinking moving into the \"flow\" of money . The opposite of flow is struggle. Struggle not only stops the cash-flow, but is emotionally draining. Struggle causes a lot of pain because it involves a lot of negative emotion. Struggle is also a lot of hard work. Stuart W ilde says in his book Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle , \"Struggle is effort laced with emotion. As humans, we are required to exert effort in order to get things done. So if you're cycling up a hill delivering loaves of bread, you will expend calories pedaling. Effort is natural, but when one's energy expendi - ture gets wrapped up in loads of negative emotions, that's when you flip to the unnatural—from effort to struggle. At that point you should pull back and ask yourself loads of simple questions, ques - tions that highlight silliness.\" One of the reasons I enjoy reading Stuart W ilde's books so much is his love of humor, silliness, and tomfoolery as a mecha - nism to live in joy and abundance. I resonate with irreverent humor . I think seriousness is a mental disease. The end result is a living death. Get over yourself. If you can't laugh at yourself, you will have to start enjoying people laughing at you, because they will be! If you find yourself struggling, here are some questions you might ask yourself to instantly change your focus. What little adjustment can I make to get things moving? Are my plans realistic?

Manifesting what you want takes a combina - tion of proper thought and well executed action. I remember meeting a man on my most recent trip to India who was fasting for world peace. He fasted for one full year on nothing but boiled water - quite incredible. However, about ten days after he ended his fast, India and Pakistan tested nuclear bombs in this man's own backyard. I began to wonder if meditation alone is enough to change the planet. Y ou must eventually take ACTION. Getting \"in the flow\" takes precise thinking and good decisions. Then when you are firmly \"in the flow,\" you will notice the opportunities come to you. And then you take action to make your dreams a reality . Thoughts ---> Opportunities ---> Actions ---> Results So let me elaborate on a few principles to change your thinking in order to increase your abundance mentality . After you become aware of these key principles, I'm going to give you action items to start implementing them. Then at the end of this book, I'll teach you a mental time-line exercise where you will close your eyes and begin to reprogram yourself at the uncon - scious level. Let’s face it ... the difference between successful peo - ple and unsuccessful people is the quality of their thoughts. Likewise the difference between happy people and unhappy people is the quality of their thoughts.

I haven't even sent one press release out about this book (which I am writing at this moment) and I have writers from two of America's most influential magazines calling me wanting to do a book review. How does this happen? I feel like I'm in the flow so it doesn't surprise me anymore. And, I'm gracious and appreciative. I have the feeling I am one lucky guy. I think we are all lucky. I just decided to live in my natural state of abundance and good-luck. The above random events can logically be traced to their source. One writer read the article about me in Biography Magazine. Then, she looked on the Internet for my telephone number, etc. Y es, that's the logic process for this random event. However, there is something more. People can sense when you are in this \"zone\" and they want to be a near you. When you are in \"the flow\" people and things are magnetically attracted to you. Y ou \"attract\" instead of \"repel.\" If you have ever been single, you know the truth about dating that states, \"Women can smell desperation a mile away.\" When you don't need a date, you get lots of offers. If you seem desperate and lonely, people avoid you like the plague. Money is attracted to more money. It is basically like the financial rapport. Like attracts like. Be like money, money will find you. H OW TO T URN T HINKING INT O M ANIFEST A TION Manifesting abundance doesn’t necessarily happen overnight. I have mentioned how powerful our mind really is.

If you hold onto every little penny, you become rigid. Y ou become obsessed with poverty; and the foremost thought is what you get. If you’re always thinking, \"There’s not enough money,\" that will be what’s true, and you will get that reali - ty. So instead, simply get into the flow. Realize that the more you spend, the more you receive. Y ou will have to spend money to make money . There is a flow . When you get into that flow, money comes to you naturally . I can remember many days when I spent all my money on bills. I found myself thinking, \"How am I going to pay the next bill? I have no event happening or no promotion going on.\" But I was in the flow. I knew that it would come in. Sure enough, the next day someone would call and spend money buying my books and tapes. This would be somebody who seemed to have just mysteriously shown up. I didn’t advertise to them. I didn’t cold-call that person.

W ealth attracts wealth. Y ou don’t have to be flamboyant with your spending. In fact, I don't recommend doing this with any intention of other people noticing. This is for your brain to notice only. Definitely don’t buy more than you can afford, but realize every time you pinch and save, and make a decision based on your belief that there’s not enough money in the world, you send a signal to the world that says, \"No, there’s not enough money. I might not earn anymore. Money is scarce.\" It’s similar to the concept of dieting. When I’ve done research with overweight people, I found that a lot of the severely over - weight people actually only eat one meal a day. Now that’s interest - ing. Y ou would think, \"If someone is obese, they probably eat three, four, and five meals a day,\" but that's usually not the case. Most obese people only eat one meal per day . They are starving them - selves into obesity . What happens is this: When someone only eats one meal per day, a message is sent to the brain that says, \"I’m only getting fed once a day. I’m going to hold onto every bit of fuel (fat) that I pos - sibly can. I don't know when the next meal is coming.\" Therefore the body goes into hibernation phase - holding onto all the fat. It is only after months of dietary changes that the body finally realizes it will be \"safe\" to let go of the fat because all the nutrients it needs to survive are coming in daily . Then, the person's metabolism changes, they exercise with ease, and the natural body begins to appear as the fat dissolves.

That’s right. 10% of every penny they earn goes back to the universe to help others. Imagine the great karma you bring yourself when you give your money away to selflessly help others. Ever heard the saying, \"What goes around, comes around?\" W ell, in the case of money, there is a spiritual law that says whatever you give comes back to you ten fold. That means if you donate $100 to charity, your goodwill will come back to you in the form of $1000. I’ve tested this theory over and over and it works. When I first heard about donating 10% of my income, I thought no way can I give that much money away each month. All I kept thinking were all the things that 10% could buy me. What if I had a tight month and I needed that extra money to pay bills? The fear got to me. W ell, I decided to go on faith and give away the 10% even in my slow business months. What I discovered was there is an incred - ible joy to helping others. Suddenly I could hand a few bucks to a street person and feel richer. I could donate money to a children’ s hospital, knowing that my money was going to make some kids very happy . After a while, I didn’t even miss the extra money . Y ou will be surprised at how easily you can live off 90% of your income. Not only did I easily get along without that 10%, but I also noticed that my income was increasing each month. Hmmm.

In every house we have ever lived, the garage has been overstuffed with so much junk the garage door barely closes. We weren't even poor - but the same belief system he learned when he lived in a one bedroom wooden house raising five siblings still runs him. \"There isn't enough. I must hold onto everything. It costs too much to replace it.\" Now, Dad has actually gotten much better in the last few years as he and his financial situation have matured. Clutter is a sign of an impoverished mind. I have had the privilege of visiting many ultra rich estates and houses. For most ... less is more. Their lawns are big and well mani - cured. They have room to park the cars in the garage. Even the house is furnished in a surprisingly sparse and elegant manner . And, of course, there are no broken down cars in the yard or washers or dryers on the front porch. If you are firmly living in abundance, you TRASH what you don't use frequently and repair or replace things that break down. If you have the core belief that more stuff will always be coming your way— you throw the crap away and make space for the new stuff! The opposite of clutter is open space. In the Chinese art of Feng Shui, \"space clearing\" is the term practitioners use to clear clutter and restore the natural energy flow to a room. Feng Shui sounds like a martial art but it is really the ancient art of changing your environment to improve your life. Developed in China several thou - sand years ago, it is a proven science that helps you fine tune the energies of your home or workplace to resonate with your unique energies. Y ou do this by arranging your furniture, art and plants to create a balanced and harmonious space to conduct your life. This sounded a bit hokey to me the first time I heard of it. However, after spending time analyzing the recommendations of my feng shui consultant —they made sense. I’m not sure how painting my wall red or putting a water fountain by my door brings me suc - cess. But I know my \"thoughtful intent\" has some effect on my 383 Chapter 16 - The Spirituality of Prosperity believe this is one of the key ways of staying in the flow . My friend Brian is also big into donating 10% and has proven over and over that any money he gives returns to him ten fold. One night Brian was walking through downtown Dallas and a homeless couple approached him. Because Brian is used to giving 10% he didn’t try to avoid them or ignore them. The couple looked in dire need of some help. They asked Brian if he could spare $9 so they could stay in a shelter for the night. Brian looked into his wallet and saw he had one ten-dollar bill left. He gave them the ten dollars and a ride to the shelter . The next day Brian’s dad gave him a lottery card just for the heck of it, and Brian won $100, exactly ten times what he had given the homeless couple the night before. The universe works in mysterious ways and seems to favor those who are charitable. Donating 10% is the most direct route to train your brain in believing \"I have plenty of money.\" This act alone will change your belief system.

From a totally practical angle, the act of \"clearing clutter\" is both emotionally and physically refreshing. I notice this even at my desk. When I put all the loose papers in labeled folders and start the day with a clear desk, new opportunities find me in a state of readiness. If your garage is filled with junk, where are you going to park your new car? Clearing space prepares your mind for the flow of new forms of energy. (Things, money, jobs, people, etc.) I bet if you were to go into your garage or rummage through you closets, you’d find clothes you never wear anymore, books you no longer read, items like old TV sets that are broken, but you've been hanging onto them anyway . All this stuff is just cluttering up your life and blocking the flow of prosperity. Part of living with abundance mentality is being able to let go of material things. Space Clearing is simply getting rid of stuff that takes up space in your life, so that new stuff can fill that empty space. For instance, let’s say you’ve been wanting a new television set. Y our old TV is on the blink but it isn't totally broken. Y ou’re tired of it, but don’t think you have enough money to go buy a brand new one. Here is how you turn this situation into an opportunity to oper - ate in the \"flow.\" Y ou take that TV to the back of your car and drive around until you find someone to give it to. Y es. Just give it away! This sends a huge signal that there is an abundance of the TV ener - gy in your life. Now, every time you look at that blank hole on your entertainment center, you will start asking how you can get a new TV . Y ou might find one just appears to you with no money out of pocket. Y ou might stop by a garage sale and find one for sale or a friend of yours may suddenly decide to give you theirs. I give stuff away all the time. It seems magical, as soon as I give away an old item, a new one shows up almost immediately . That’s the way the universe works when you live in abundance.

Y ou can analyze people's thoughts, beliefs, history, and even their experiences. There are lots of other things, which I could go into it, but it all begins with a thought.

If you’re a vet - eran reader of self-improvement books, then you may have been frustrated by doing lots of positive thinking and NOT seeing any manifestation of wealth and happiness in your life.

H OW Y OUR B RAIN L OOKS FOR O PPORTUNITIES Did you know that part of your brain is already designed to search for opportunities? It’s true. The lower portion of your brain, inside the Medulla, contains an area known as the Reticular Activating System (RAS). It keeps the higher brain centers alert and ready for input. The reticular activating system also filters out con - stant stimuli such as things you see everyday in your environment. T ake for instance your living room. When you are sitting in your living room watching TV, you probably notice the program on TV , but not the other details of the living room. Y our brain tunes every - thing but the TV out when you are focused. It would become annoying if our RAS didn't tell our brains that we don't have to con - sciously notice every detail in our living room. The RAS allows you to tune out everything that is unnecessary to pay attention to and to focus on what’s important to you in the moment. One way to direct your RAS to focus on something specific is through asking ques - tions. I’ll demonstrate. \"What color are your eyes?\" Y ou thought about your eye color, didn’t you? The color blue, green or brown probably came right to your attention. When I asked you that ques - tion, your reticular activating system had to go search for an answer . Now since you know the color of your eyes, the answer probably popped into your head immediately . When you ask questions that you don’t know the answer to, it will take your mind a little longer to come up with an answer. Sometimes your brain needs to do a lit - tle research, have you talk to people or process the question a while. It could take moments, days or weeks to find the answer depending 391 Chapter 17- Questions Wealthy People A s k Nice try.\" Etc. Etc. This is why affirmations don't work consistently - they bump into reality and your brain filters them out. Positive thinking has to be performed with the proper syntax.

The word choice and images you use during self- talk and goal planning are significant to you getting your outcome. T urning any affirmation or desired outcome into a question is magical. This may seem like a silly assignment but it might be the most powerful habit you will ever adopt. Instead of saying affirmations, you ask empowering questions that your brain is forced to answer .

Then days later the woman’s name suddenly pops into your aware - ness. W ell, that’s how your brain works. Even though your con - scious mind had let the question go unanswered, your unconscious mind kept searching your memories for an answer until it was satis - fied. So how does knowing this information about the RAS make you richer? W ell, when you ask your unconscious mind specific questions like \"What is the fastest way I can earn $5,000?\" you are giving your RAS a specific opportunity to look for . The back of your brain will work constantly until it locates the fastest way you can earn $5,000. Once it does, your RAS will bring the opportunity to your attention and you will experience an Aha!

In order to take on such a huge feat, Brian first adopted the belief system that he could pay back that money. On his current income, that took a leap of faith. He set a date three years into the future to be debt free. He charted out his debts and visualized each one going down to zero. He paid small payments to each at first, and then started paying more and more as he gained momentum. All along the way, Brian kept asking himself a series of key questions: \"How can I pay off this debt within three years?\" \"What needs to happen for me to pay off this debt quickly and easily?\" \"I wonder where I can earn extra money to pay this debt of f even faster.\" \"How good will I feel when I am debt-free?\" What Brian was doing was challenging his unconscious mind to find solutions to his desired outcome.

It's called the What's Good and New? game. I suggest playing it with your significant other, your family, or your roommate. Y ou can do it alone, but after the first two weeks, it gets harder . When it gets tougher, that's when you start to learn and create new habits. If you do this simple 60 second game for one month, you might do it for life! Each morning, before you start the day, you must articulate in words something that is good and new. It can be one thing that is both good and new. Or you can choose one thing that is good and one thing that is new . This forces you to take daily inventory of your world. W e forget to be appreciative or even notice the good 396 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy things in our world. Ask your partner to keep you accountable. Don't cheat. Don't let them start their day until they speak loud and clear what they find good and new . There is only one rule, you can't name the same item twice ... ever . Therefore, if you say, \"You Honey . Y ou’re good and the milk is new.\" you are not allowed to pick \"you or milk\" ever again. This is easy for the first dozen items. But as you run out of the obvious things, your brain starts to do a mental search each day . This \"men - tal search\" actually grows new neuro-pathways while creating a habit of finding what is good and new in your world.

When, in fact, all time is free. T ime just exists. None of use has any more or any less time than anyone else. At the same time, time costs us money . According to economic theory , time costs you money in the form of \"opportunity cost.\" I first learned the term opportunity cost while getting my business degree at Pepperdine University. Essentially, every decision we make can be viewed as an opportunity. Even something as simple as sitting in your car at a fork in the road. If you drive north, you forfeit all the experiences than the south road could have given you. If you turn south, it costs you the lessons the north route could have given you.

Dr Stanley interviewed thousands of millionaires since 1973 to deter - mine their lifestyles, spending habits, belief systems, etc. One inter - esting revelation relating to time was this: The typical millionaire wakes up at 6:40 am. Only about one if five rises before 5:40 am. I had heard through the grapevine that self-made millionaires woke up at 4 am. I read that Donald T rump, the New Y ork real estate tycoon, always gets up before sunrise. I tried that a few times. It doesn't work for me or my body . When I go to bed at 2:00 am, I sure can’t get up at 4:00 am. Through his research, Dr. Stanley found this fact: \"There is no statistically significant correlation between the time one wakes up in the morning and one's wealth.\" So, you don't have to give up on your sleep to become wealthy , but you clearly can't sleep 12 hours a night either .

A man asked, \"What think you of the times? W on't these heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How shall we ever pay them? What would you advise us to do?\" As Benjamin Franklin watched from afar, Father Abraham stood up and said, \"If you'd have my advice, I'll give it to you in short, for a word to the wise is enough, and many words won't fill a bushel.\" The crowd gathered around for his words of advice. Father Richard spoke, \"If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest prodigality, since, as he elsewhere tells us, lost time is never found again; and what we call time-enough, always proves little enough. Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity. Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all easy, as Poor Richard says; and He that riseth late, must trot all day , and shall scarce overtake his business at night. While laziness trav - els so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes him, Drive thy business, let not that drive thee; and Early to bed early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\" Old Ben smiled as his words were preached by the Father. He was proud that perhaps he had made a difference. But, to his dismay, as soon as the shops opened the crowd rushed in to spend every coin in their pockets. They bought extravagantly, notwithstanding his cautions and their own fear of the taxes. Naturally, they continued to complain about the taxes, the economy, and their financial condition as they spent. He had stopped from purchasing a new overcoat.

Since this is a gross income figure, not a net income figure, it can be deceiving. Y ou might be thinking, \"Sure Bart, that is if I worked 24 hours per day. Nobody works 24 hours per day.\" Y ou are right, most people don't work 24 hours per day. But, self-made millionaires don't work the typical labor union's 8.5 hours per day either. Here is a hard fact to realize. It's not the hours that you work that matter. It's the amount of money you put in your asset column. The reason this number is soooooooo important is because most people burn a lot of their time doing non-income earning activities. The chances of you getting rich only working just 8.5 hours per day for someone else's company are very slim. I'm not saying you have to be an entrepre - neur . What I am saying is that you must put an additional 1-3 hours of your day into learning, investing, networking, or otherwise turn - ing your time into wealth. The statistics reveal that the typical \"millionaire\" household in Dr. Stanley’s study earned about $436,000 last year . This household has a net worth of $4.3 million. Over 32% of the Americans in his study are business owners or entrepreneurs. Nearly 16% are senior level executives. 10% are attorneys. 9% are physicians. The other 1/3 consist of a mixed group of teachers, accountants, sales profes - sionals, professors, housewives, retirees, middle managers, etc. The lesson here is simple. Y ou don't have to earn $436,000 this year to be rich. However, you do have to start investing your time as if you were already earning that kind of money. Remember ... \"Act as if.\" Act as if you were already rich. Fake it till you make it. The secret to modeling successful people is find out what they do and live that way .

When I realized this, I stopped answering my office line. If you call my office, you will very rarely hear my voice pickup the phone. Before I could afford to hire an assistant, I simply let the calls go to voicemail. It might have cost me a book sale or two by not answer - ing those calls.

Much of what I've talked about in this book has to do with reshap - ing the ego/personality part of your life and interacting with the world in a new way . This is an essential component. An equally important component is to use the power of your inner spiritual self to tap into higher powers that move the world in ways we cannot see. Many practitioners of various forms of meditation actually feel, see, attract, and move energy through their body and out into the world. This may sound a bit hocus-pocus to the typical western mind, but there is lots of scientific evidence that even the most tan - gible concrete items in the universe (like this book or the chair you are sitting in) are nothing more than energy atoms vibrating at vari - ous frequencies. In physics, energy never dies... it just changes forms.

In most meditation techniques you will want to physically become still, comfortable, and attempt to quiet the mind from external distrac - tions, your to-do list, worries, and turn off all the internal pictures for a few moments as you take yourself from the waking Beta brain wave pattern, into a more relaxing meditative Alpha brain wave pat - tern. Some people count backwards twenty down to one. Others suggest you focus every aspect of your breathing. Say to yourself, \"I'm breathing in. I'm breathing out.\" For many busy minded people, just sitting alone is difficult and very good for you. I have found that the electronically induced meditations using \"light & sound\" machines take me into deep states of trance even more quickly that simply closing my eyes.

Y ou may find 10 minutes a day in silence can reap many times more rewards than ten minutes of busy-ness. (Notice busy-ness sounds a lot like doing business.) Meditation can make you money . There are thousands of theories on how to meditate properly. In my opinion, all systems have value. Deepak Chopra offers the guidance to quiet the mind of all internal thoughts. He suggests finding the space between the thoughts. The point of mental silence between the thoughts is where you begin to communicate with your higher self. I do know this about Deepak. He is an incredibly wealthy and happy man that has found a way to be \"of service\" to humanity and walk firmly inside his divine spirit while contributing the betterment of society and his own family. In my mid 20's I vol - unteered to work on his staff during one of his seminars where he taught many meditation and healing techniques. The staff and I were having lunch in a tiny room in the hotel. My back was to the door and I was visiting with a friend. I felt a powerful and kind energy shift flow over me. In an instant something had changed. I knew someone had entered the room. I turned around to see Deepak had quietly and humbly entered the staff room to grab a piece of fruit. The young lady I was talking to also noticed the pro - found \"wave\" of positive energy that went through us. Hmmm? Is it possible that some people that are truly in touch with their \"inner God\" vibrate at a higher frequency than others? Is energy vibra - tions like the stations on a radio dials, a personal power we can learn to do control through meditation? Many people believe we can. I have met some amazingly kind, wealthy, happy, and power - ful people that I can only describe through a feeling I get... not by what they do, say, or look like.

This is going to be a lesson on where you store your time in your mind. If this sounds confusing, hang on. I’m about to intro - duce to you a mental process that can double or triple the speed of the manifestation process of your goals. In fact, discovering how you store \"time\" can have profound effects on your future goals, your current pleasure in life, and even in dealing with things in your past. I encourage you to utilize this technique in your weekly closed eye meditation sessions. (By the way, this is much more than just another meditative technique. This is also a therapeutic technique used successfully by NLP practitioners, hypnotherapists, and psychologists worldwide to heal past issues and program bright and wonderful future events. I actually have carried a line of cas - sette tapes that use this technique for the past ten years.) The animal kingdom doesn't have an exact understanding of time. The clock and the concept of time is a human concept. For animals, now is all there is. It is either time to fly south... or it isn't time to fly south.

Do you agree? The reason it is important to discover the exact process of how 411 Chapter 19 - Time Line & Meditation might think. Thinking about nothing is tricky. But with practice, you can learn to let go of your thoughts. Then, let your mind wan - der free. I often visualize myself floating through the stars in outer space. I imagine fewer and fewer stars as I travel into total peaceful blackness. Naturally, there is no noise in space except the sound of my own breathing. Eventually, I stop thinking and my unconscious mind takes over . After you come back and open your eyes... you might attempt to analyze the metaphors, stories, or mental imagery for clues to how they might relate to today's issues. Many people keep a notebook or diary of their meditative experiences. T HE E DISON T ECHNIQUE Another powerful creative problem solving technique was first reportedly used by Thomas Edison, the great inventor. Mr. Edison was known for solving his creative roadblocks using short cat naps. If he found himself at an analytical stuck point, he would simply boil down the problem into one simple question. Once he had the right question, he would excuse himself for a nap. In the late 1800's, it wasn't very acceptable in America to fire up some incense and meditate in the lotus position at the factory. His nap was really just a quiet meditative time in which he simply repeated his one question over and over and over in his head until he drifted off into a light sleep. When he woke up, he usually had an answer. In my case, I often get the answer hours, days or weeks later. But the answer always comes and it feels like a higher being just hands me the envelope with the correct answer inside. It seems effortless if you let your higher self assist you solve to your problems. Get quiet, ask a question, stop thinking, and let go. The other technique I am going to share with you is much more pragmatic and self-directed.

Y our mind has a way of taking one event and encoding it as part of your past, present, or future. That encoding process can be described in part by your internal time-line. Most people who have never studied NLP or T ime-Line have never thought about the inside of their minds as huge 3-D holo - graphic studios. Instead of just running movies in your mind, you actually have an entire theatre with sound, voices, distance, volume, and the ability to turn your head 360 degrees and view your memo - ries and life from different angles.

Y ou have already given people clues by the language you choose and even the hand motions you display . Y ou may have noticed as people talk, they give you a description of what they are doing inside their mind. Have you ever said, \"You are going to look back on this and laugh?\" Have you heard, \"Let's put this behind us as soon as possible.\" What about, \"Time is creeping on me.\" I have also seen people point to places inside the house to describe events that have nothing to do with the house. My friend Chris always points to his right when he describes what he is doing next week. (Is next week in the kitchen?) Likewise, he uses his hand and points to his left when he talks about things that have already happened. I bet he doesn't even notice it, but I do. The use of temporal language and physical ges - tures are just clues to how people are structuring their own internal time machine. 413 Chapter 19 - Time Line & Meditation you store time is once you know your own internal map of the past and future - you can chart an exact route to your desired destination. Y ou can be more exact in \"installing goals\" into your memory banks of your unconscious mind. Furthermore, if you have memories in your past that are still bothering you (childhood traumas, loss, pain, etc) you have a more direct route to go back and adjust the memory to be less influential over your current state of mind. In reality, your past isn't the prob - lem. The past is over . The problem is your \"memory\" of the event is stored in a way that drives and directs your current emotions.

Other people have an internal clock that can wake them up each morning without an alarm no matter how late they stayed up. Some people have a totally organized time schedule while others do not.

Imagine being able to program your future into the future memory banks of your unconscious mind, much like you would transfer a file into the hard disk of your personal computer . What if you could create a mental image of the accomplishment of this goal? And then, in your mind, take that event and mentally place it in your future time line, in the future memory banks of your own conscious mind? And then your unconscious mind would see to it that you do the things you need to do to lead up to the accomplishment of the goal. This is, in a nut - shell, how T ime-Line works for creating your desired future. The result is what some researchers call \"sustained unconscious motivation\". That is, you feel motivated without having to try to do it consciously, because your unconscious mind is working on the goal 24 hours a day and believes that you will achieve your desired future. The mental technique can instantly change how you feel about the goal you've put on your internal time line.

Y ou are leaving nothing to chance. The next diagram shows an example of how I see my time-line. Don't model me. Use your own time-line unless you feel your time line is a disservice to you. For example, if your past is in front of you and your future is behind you...you obviously have a tendency to focus on the past and find it hard to see the future. In that case, practice switching the time line for experimental purposes. For most people, use your current structure for the following time-line exercise. I store time with the past behind me to the left and the future in front of me to the right. Because today and tomorrow are \"right in front of me\" I often let today's activities usurp tomorrow's obliga - tions. I get caught up in today and forget about tomorrow. So, I get lost \"in time.\" Because the future is slightly off to the right, I can see long term goals unconsciously. I don't want to change this because being able to be so \"present in time\" also makes me very happy in the moment and do well performing \"in the moment activ - ities” like speaking and writing.) I prefer to have an accountant and manager who sees time from left to right. Hopefully, they can keep to a tight schedule and help me not miss appointments.

(Submodalites are explained in more detail by Richard Bandler in his book Using Your Brain for a Change .) Submodalites are the various elements that shape an internal image, thought, or feeling. Y ou could imagine yourself winning a gold medal using a bright image, a dark image, a large image, a small image, a loud crowd, no sound, in full color, in black-n-white, grainy film, clear film, warm feelings, hot sensa - tions, etc. Submodalities assist you in fully associating into any memory or future outcome.

Y ou will want to use this model of your time-line when you do goal set - ting exercises and meditation. During the closed eye meditation, you will be asked to float above your time line and move into the future or past. This is most effective if you can actually see or feel yourself moving up and down the time-line of your life. The image of the actual time-line varies. I have used a golden glowing neon type line as my time line. I have also used purple paint and white light to represent the line. The farther Up, Up, and Up you go above your body, the tinier the time line will become. If you imagine yourself floating far enough above your head, the entire time line of your life will seem less than one inch long. This is a great place to go to get per - spective on your life. (I find when I mentally float high enough into space and view the entire planet from outerspace, I feel the one-ness of the planet and my problems seem very insignificant in contrast to the vast universe.) I will ask you to float a few feet above and even inside your time-line during the closed eye media - tion. The following chapter can be used as a template of how you guide yourself through the process of using your own time-line to accelerate achieving your outcomes. I mastered the technique using actual live seminars and guided visual imagery via CD's and audio tapes. Y ou might want to review chapter 2 and discover if there is anything more you want to program into your future. During the process, it is essential you fully associate with the goals or outcome.

I'm curious, if you have no past and no obligations... what would you create of your life from this point forward?

One phrase that sums up the lives of happy and rich people still holds true today as it did when I was four years old. My dad, Curtis used to say, \"Habits can be the best of friends or the worst of enemies.\" The concept of building habits toward success was illustrated beau - tifully in Stephen Covey's best selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People . In my life, the healthy habits that I adopted young were the key reasons I achieved such a high level of success at an early age. Even such character traits as honesty, diplomacy, and generosity take conditioning to become habits. Behavioral habits such as turn - ing off the lights when you leave the room, drinking 8 glasses of water per day, or paying your bills before the due date also require a period of conditioning. If you think back to the chapter relating to handwriting analysis and grapho-therapy, I discussed neuro-logically how habits are formed in the brain. The habit of tying your shoes laces is created the same way the habit of crossing your t-bar at the top of the stem. Practice, practice, practice. In order to really master the concepts in this book, you have to practice. The art of making a decision to live in a \"drama-free\" zone takes practice. If you currently live from one crisis to the next, you will have plenty of opportunities to practice starting now . 429 Chapter 21- Turning Wealth & Happiness into Habits"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"noon sometimes. Naturally, when I finally \"got up and moving\" I felt like I had lost half the day . So, as we discussed some mechanisms to \"motivate\" ourselves to get out of bed at a reasonable time, we concocted a plan. We gave each other permission to dump ice water on the other's head if he didn't get up on the first alarm. Ouch. That's motivation by pain! I remember days hitting the snooze alarm just watching the door of my room, worrying Rand was going to fly in with a bucket of ice water. It worked, the pain of the threat of ice water motivated both of us to create new habits and only two times did our pillows get soaked with water! If you are thinking that game sounds sophomoric and silly , wait...it gets better. Because of our mutual agreement that not being able to control something as simple as when we get out of bed was childish and embarrassing, we agreed to treat each other like children. How are kids motivated? Pain vs. pleasure. So, we created a system where we rewarded ourselves like we were in grade school again. I remember getting gold stars for every book I read in elemen - tary school. That was the ticket. Gold stars for habits we did. No gold star for not doing the habit. So, we bought poster board and created a 3 foot by 2 foot chart with a list of all our habits that we could get gold stars for doing. W e listed all the habits we wanted to do on a daily basis and gave ourselves gold stars at the end of each day. It became a open- to-the-public checklist of our success habits. Rand's list had items such as 50 push ups, daily teeth flossing, no TV, making his bed, and of course, getting up at the first alarm. My list had such items as daily carrot juice, daily teeth flossing, the ancient T ibeten exer - cises, journal writing, and of course getting up at the first alarm. T o motivate ourselves even more, we posted our charts on the 431 Chapter 21- Turning Wealth & Happiness into Habits If you are already living a very peaceful life, you will have to look for and even schedule learning opportunities to flex that new mental muscle. One of the reasons people from all over the world have seen dramatic results with the handwriting changes is that they have a daily opportunity to practice. Many people use pen and paper daily, so they have a vehicle for practice. If you never write, you have to schedule the practice. If you are not in the habit of eating vegetables or exercising, you must schedule them until they become habits. If you aren't saving 10% of your income, you start today and do it until it becomes habitual. Once you create habits out of doing the things necessary to live in the flow of money, good health, and happiness - it seems natural and effortless. I'll share with you a funny true story that reveals the embarrass - ing fact that I too still have a lot to learn about life. When I was about 25 years old, I was living in Dallas with a roommate and close friend named Rand Stagen. Because both Rand and I were entrepreneurs, we created our own schedule. Neither one of us had ever developed the habits of getting up early or getting out bed on the first alarm. I've been reading books and attending self-improvement semi - nars since I was fourteen. I didn't need any more knowledge. What I needed was better habits. For Rand, his major problem was he had a lifelong habit of watching television to wind down at the end of the day. He actually had tremendous difficulty falling asleep if he didn't have the TV on! He knew that staying up until 2 am watching reruns of bad sitcoms was not the shortcut to the cover of Fortune Magazine ! For me, I preferred to stay up late and didn't seem to wake up in the mornings unless I had an appointment. If I didn't have an appointment, my body would beg me to sleep until 10, 11, even 430 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"432 Bart Baggett’s Success Secrets of the Rich & Happy kitchen wall so all our friends could see what dorks we were. I imagine we had a monthly prize for the guy with the most gold stars. The habit of keeping track of our habits was rewarding enough. Now, many years later, both Rand and I are professional speak - ers who teach people how to live more prosperous fulfilling lives. (www.stagen.com) Both of us still use a more advanced form of that silly daily habit success checklist. W e don't use gold stars, we use check marks. W e don't post the list on poster board, we write inside our daily organizer/ time planner . The principle is the same. Until it becomes a habit, it stays on our healthy habits success checklist. Sometimes, we have to recycle habits that we forget to keep. I recently saw Rand's Success Checklist and he had written the habit of attending Kung Fu training twice a week. He gets the reward of getting that checkmark twice a week if he keeps that commitment. I had to again add into my success checklist lifting weights three times per week. During the time I wrote the majority of this book, I stopped lifting weights or exercising as often as I would normally do. So, back into the \"success checklist\" that habit goes. I already turn off the lights when I leave the room, so I don't include that habit on my list. From a personal growth standpoint, I have committed to medi - tate at least twice a week. Some weeks I get three checks, some weeks I only get one. In any case, this weekly session of planning and the daily confirmation of keeping track of my healthy habits gives me great perspective on how balanced I am keeping my life. If you found yourself really out of balance using the \"life boarding\" disk program in chapter 8, you will want to schedule making deposits into the areas of your life you need improvement. If your relationship is suffering, you might schedule \"Sincere compliment to my spouse daily.\" Or, you might schedule one evening per week as a \"romantic time with my spouse.\" 433 Chapter 21- Turning Wealth & Happiness into Habits Healthy Habits Success Checklist W eek of January 14-January 28 W ake T otal Sleep (hours) Make bed (7x) Floss T eeth(2x) Meditate /Time Line Visualization (2x) T ibetan Rites (2x) No Coffee (4x) 6 Glasses Of Water (7x) Y oga / Aerobic (2x) No Drama Zone (7x) T alk to parents by phone (1x) Contribute to Charity (1x) Read 20 minutes per day (7x) Review Real Estate in classifieds (1x) Date with Spouse (1x) One page of handwriting changes (7x) Clean Car (1x) Don't use the word \"try\" T ake Vitamins (7x) No T elevision (3x) Put 10% of income into investments.
