In a lop-sided kind of comparison, if you already have a good memory, training is not needed, and if you do not—well, how useful really is training? I can answer this conundrum by suggesting that memory exists only in the use of it. It may not be true that everyone has a good memory to begin with, although I should like to think so; but it is certainly true that many people simply do not use the memory they have. It has always seemed to me that memory systems tend to be cumbersome, even though, as you will see, I have developed one of my own. They are like crutches, when one ought to walk unaided. How much simpler to remember the thing directly rather than to have to remember a way of remembering It! A fine way to send off a book on memory training, you may say—but let me add quickly that to my mind the real value of memory training and a book such as Tony Buzan's is that it is, or should be, self-liquidating, so to speak. No doubt memory can be trained, like an unused muscle, on a dumbbell, but in the end the dumbbell is thrown away and the muscle goes to work on the job to be done rather than on a training aid. Could you remember something—let us assume you have a 'bad memory'— if you had to? James Bond lay dying. 'The formula,' he whispers, '... can say it only once.... Your life depends on it.... The world will go smash if you don't. ...' Would you remember? I think you would. This attention set seems to me all-important in remember- ing. Let me give you a small example. Someone gives you his telephone number over the telephone. Almost invariably nine persons out of ten will say: 'Would you mind repeating that?' Why? He said it perfectly clearly the first time. All you had to 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"do was to press the switch marked 'attention set' rather than leaving the one on that says 'Oh, I'll get it on the second or third try'. A matter of habit. Of course, I happen to be one of those lucky people who can repeat the number out loud, and then actually 'hear it' for a long time, simply by listening. Try it some time. One more thing. Memory is not just a quantitative faculty. Its potential capacity is probably astronomical, but I suspect it is not unlimited, although few of us are in danger of getting even near the limit. Yet I do know two men, each of whom speaks—and speaks fluently, idiomatically—more than a dozen languages, and, sad to relate, neither of them has any- thing of importance to say in any of them! Don't try to turn yourself into an 'idiot savant'. I long ago gave up making a vast parking lot of facts and figures of my mind. It's enjoyable enough to dazzle people with displays of esoteric knowledge (I have sometimes described knowledge as 'the opium of the intelligent'), but what is the point, really? Do you want to be a walking almanac? It's no great hardship to carry a small book of telephone numbers, or to keep an encyclopaedia on your shelves. Today I try to use my memory for storing up relationships, how things hang together, insight. I see the great function and aim of mind, with its marvellous tool, memory, as integration, or, if you will forgive the grandiloquent term, wisdom. Tony Buzan's book Speed Memory is an excellent 'first step' toward the realisation of that goal.

You will also be able to perform 'memory feats' with * number games and cards. The course was compiled over a number of years, taking Into consideration the latest educational and psychological theories as well as a wide range of material concerned with memory systems. As a result Speed Memory will give you as wide an introduc- tion to the art of memory training as do the much-publicised memory training courses advertised in the national press. The course will enable you also to see how the 'Super-Brain' memory experts perform their amazing feats, while at the same time enabling you to perform with the same competence! In other words, anyone who approaches this book seriously can himself become, in the popular sense of the term, a mental wizard! It is a number of years since the widespread publicity sur- rounding Pelmanism made the art of memory training well- known. But it has taken all this time for the various systems to be completely developed, and for new and exciting systems to be introduced. Speed Memory brings the reader to this exciting point in time. The book is programmed to make the learning of the various systems especially easy. The first section introduces the history of memory and the development of ideas and practices sur- rounding it, thus providing a context for subsequent learning. The next few chapters introduce simple Link and Peg systems, 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"enabling you to exercise your growing capacities on progress- ively more difficult material and advanced concepts. Among these systems is an entirely new and original system, Skipnum, recently developed by my close friend, Heinz Norden, the well- known polymath. After these basic systems have been introduced an important chapter is devoted to the memorisation of names and faces, as well as facts relating to them. This is followed by the introduction of the Major System, a highly developed mnemonic system that serves not only as an almost infinite Peg system (1,000 Peg words are included in this chapter!), but also a system that may be applied to the memorisation of numbers in their various forms. The remainder of the book is devoted in part to these numerical memorisations (dates, prices, telephone numbers, anniversaries and birthdays, etc.) and in part to the more general application of memory systems to remembering speeches, scripts, jokes, articles, narratives, languages, appoint- ments and schedules. In conclusion, special examination techniques are discussed and general advice is given. 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE HISTORY OF MEMORY From the time when man first began to depend on his mind for coping with the environment, the possession of an excellent memory has placed individuals in positions of both command and respect. The amazing feats in remembering accomplished by particular people were so impressive that they have become legendary! The Greeks It is difficult to say exactly when and where the first inte- grated ideas on memory arose. It is reasonable to state, how- ever, that the first sophisticated concepts can be attributed to the Greeks some 600 years before the birth of Christ. As we look back on them now, these 'sophisticated' ideas were surprisingly naive, especially since some of the men proposing them are numbered among the greatest thinkers the world has ever known! In the 6th century B.C., Parmenides thought of memory as being a mixture of light and dark or heat and cold! He thought that as long as any given mixture remained unstirred, the memory would be perfect. As soon as the mixture was altered, forgetting occurred. In the 5th century B.C. Diogenes of Appollonia advanced a different theory. He suggested that memory was a process which consisted of events producing an equal distribution of. air in the body. Like Parmenides he thought that when this equilibrium was disturbed forgetting would occur. Not surprisingly, the first person to introduce a really major idea in the field of memory was Plato, in the 4th century B.C. His theory is known as the Wax Tablet Hypothesis and is still accepted by some people today, although there is growing disagreement. To Plato the mind accepted impressions in the same way that wax becomes marked when a pointed object is moved around on its surface. Once the impression had been made Plato assumed it remained until, with time, it wore away, 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"leaving a smooth surface once more. This smooth surface was, of course, what Plato considered to be complete forgetting—the opposite aspects of the same process. As will become clear later, many people now feel that they are actually two quite different processes. Shortly after Plato, Zeno the Stoic slightly modified Plato's ideas, suggesting that sensations actually 'wrote' impressions on the wax tablet. When Zeno referred to the mind and its memory he, like the Greeks before him, did not place it in any particular organ or section of the body. To him and to the Greeks 'mind' was a loose and very unclear concept. The first man to introduce a more scientific terminology was Aristotle, in the late 4th century B.C. He maintained that the language previously used was not adequate to explain the physical aspects of memory. In applying his new language Aristotle attributed to the heart most of the functions that we properly attribute to the brain. Part of the heart's function, he realised, was concerned with the blood, and he felt that memory was based on the blood's movements. He thought forgetting to be the result of a gradual slowing down of these movements. Aristotle made another important contribution to sub- sequent thinking on the subject of memory when he introduced his laws of the association of ideas. The concept of association of ideas and images is now generally thought to be of major importance to memory. Throughout Speed Memory this con- cept will be discussed, developed and applied. In the 3rd century B.C. Herophilus introduced to the discus- sion 'vital' and 'animal' spirits. He considered the higher order vital spirits to be located in the heart. These higher order spirits produced the lower order animal spirits, which included the memory, the brain, and the nervous system. All of these he thought to be secondary in importance to the heart! It is interesting to note that one reason advanced by Hero- philus for man's superiority over animals was the large number of creases in man's brain. (these creases are now known as convolutions of the cortex). Despite the fact of his observation, Herophilus offered no reason for his conclusion. It was not until the 19th century, over 2,000 years later, that the real import- ance of the cortex was discovered. In summary, the Greeks made the following significant contribution: they were the first to seek a physical as opposed 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"to a spiritual basis for memory; they developed scientific con- cepts and a language structure that helped the development of these concepts; and they contributed the Wax Tablet hypo- thesis which suggested that memory and forgetting were opposite aspects of the same process. The Romans Surprisingly, the contributions of the Romans were minimal. The major thinkers of their time, including Cicero in the 1st century B.C. and Quintilian in the 1st century A.D., accepted without question the Wax Tablet concept of memory, and did little further work. Their major contribution was in the development of memory systems. It was they who first introduced the idea of a Link system and a Room system, both of which will be described in later chapters. The Influence of the Christian Church The next major contributor to the progress of ideas on memory was the great physician Galen in the 2nd century A.D. He located and delineated various anatomical and physiological structures, as well as further investigating the function and structure of the nervous system. Like the later Greeks, he assumed that memory and mental processes were part of the lower order of animal spirits. These spirits he thought were manufactured in the sides of the brain, and it was consequently here that memory was seated. Galen thought that air was sucked into the brain, mixing with the vital spirits. This mixture produced animal spirits which were pushed down through the nervous system, enabl- ing us to feel and taste, etc. Galen's ideas on memory were rapidly accepted and con- doned by the Church which at this time was beginning to exert a great influence. His ideas became doctrine, and on that account little progress was made in the field for 1,500 years. This mental suppression stifled some of the greatest minds that philosophy and science has produced! St. Augustine in the 4th century A.D. accepted the Church's ideas, considering memory to be a function of the soul, which had a physical seat in the brain. He never expanded on the anatomical aspects of his ideas. From the time of St. Augustine until the 17th century there 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"were virtually no significant developments in ideas on memory, and even in the 17th century new ideas were restricted by doctrine. Even such great a thinker as Descartes accepted Galen's basic ideas, although he thought that animal spirits were sent from the pineal gland on special courses through the brain until they came to the part where memory could be triggered. The more clear-cut these courses, the more readily, he thought, would they open when animal spirits travelled through them. It was in this way that he explained the improve- ment of memory and the development of what are known as 'memory traces'. A memory trace is a physical change in the nervous system that was not present before learning. The trace enables us to recall. Another great philosopher, who 'went along with the tide' was Thomas Hobbes, who discussed and considered the idea of memory but contributed little to what had been said before. He agreed with Aristotle's ideas, rejecting non-physical explana- tions of memory. He did not, however, specify the real nature of memory, nor did he make any significant attempts to locate it accurately. In summary, it is evident from the theories of the 16th century intellectuals that the influence of Galen and the Church had been profound. Almost without exception these great thinkers uncritically accepted primitive ideas on memory. Transitional Period — The 18 th Century One of the first thinkers to be influenced by the new surge of science and by the ideas of Newton was Hartley, who developed the vibratory theory of memory. Applying Newton's ideas on vibrating particles, Hartley suggested that there were memory vibrations in the brain which began before birth. New sensa- tions modified existing vibrations in degree, kind, place and direction. After influence by a new sensation, vibrations quickly returned to their natural state. But if the same sensa- tion appeared again the vibrations took a little longer to return. This progression would finally result in the vibrations remain- ing in their 'new' state, and a memory trace was established. Other major thinkers of this period included Zanotti who was the first to link electrical forces with brain functions, and Bonnet who developed the ideas of Hartley in relation to the flexibility of nerve fibres. The more often nerves were used, the 14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"more easily he thought they vibrated, and the better memory would then be. The theories of these men were more sophisticated than previous ones because they had been largely influenced by developments in related scientific fields. This interaction of ideas laid the groundwork for some of the more modern theories of memory in the 18th century. The 19 th Century With the development of science in Germany in the 19th century, some important developments occurred. Many of the ideas initiated by the Greeks were overthrown, and work on memory expanded to include the biological sciences. Prochaska finally and irrevocably rejected the age-old idea of animal spirits, on the ground that it has no scientific basis and no evidence to support it. He felt that limited existing know- ledge made speculation on the location of memory in the brain a waste of time. 'Spatial localisation may be possible', he said, 'but we just do not know enough at the moment to make it a useful idea.' It was not for some 50 years that localising the area of memory function became a useful pursuit. Another major theory presented in this century was that of Flourens, who 'located' the memory in every part of the brain! He said that the brain acted as a whole and could not be inter- preted as the interaction of elementary parts. His views held the field of physiology for some time, and it is only recently that great strides have been made in the development of our thinking on memory. Modern Theories Modern developments in memory have been aided to an enormous degree by advances in technology and methodology. Almost without exception psychologists and other thinkers in this field agree that memory is located in the cerebum, which is the large area of the brain covering the surface of the cortex. Even today however, the exact localisation of memory areas is proving a difficult task, as is the accurate understanding of the function of memory itself. Current thought has progressed from Ebbinghaus's work with learning and forgetting curves at the turn of the century, to advanced and complex theories. Research and theory can be roughly divided into 3 main 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"areas: work on establishing a biochemical basis for memory; theories which suggest that memory can no longer be consid- ered as a single process but must be broken down into divi- sions; and Penfield's work on Brain Stimulation. Research into the biochemical basis for memory was initiated by Hyden in the late 1950's. This theory suggests that RNA (ribonucleic acid), a complex molecule, serves as a chemical mediator for memory. RNA is produced by the substance DNA (deoxyrinbonucleic acid) which is responsible for our genetic inheritance—for example DNA decides whether your eyes will be blue or brown, etc. A number of experiments have been performed with RNA, lending support to the idea that it does indeed have a lot to do with the way in which we remember things. For example, if animals are given certain types of training, the RNA found in certain cells is changed. And further, if the production of RNA in an animal's body is stopped or modified, these animals have been unable to learn or remember. An even more exciting experiment showed that when RNA was taken from one rat and injected into another, the second rat 'remembered' things that he had never been taught, but which the first rat had! While research into this aspect of memory is progressing other theorists are saying that we should stop emphasising 'memory', and concentrate more on the study of 'forgetting'! It is their position that we do not so much remember, as gradually forget. Encompassing this idea is the Duplex theory of remember- ing and forgetting, which states that there are two different kinds of information retention: long-term and short-term. For example, you have probably experienced a different 'feeling' from the way in which you recall a telephone number which has just been given to you, and the way in which you recall your own telephone number. The short-term situation is one in which the idea is 'in' the brain but has not yet been properly coded and is therefore more readily forgotten. In the long-term situation the idea has been completely coded, filed and stored and will probably remain for years, if not for life. Research into direct brain stimulation has been recently initiated by Dr. Wilder Penfield, a clinical surgeon. When 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"performing craniotomies (removal of a small section of the brain) in order to reduce epileptic attacks, Penfield had first to remove a portion of the skull lying over the side of the brain. Before operating Penfield conducted, and conducts, a system- atic electrical stimulation of the open brain, and the patient, who remains conscious, reports his experience after each stimulation. In an early case Penfield stimulated the temporal lobe of the brain and the patient reported a recreated memory of a childhood experience! Penfield found that stimulating various areas of the cortex produces a range of responses, but that only stimulation of the temporal lobes leads to reports of meaningful and integrated experiences. These experiences are often complete in that when recreated they include the colour, sound, movement, and emotional content of the original experiences. Of particular interest in these studies is the fact that some of the memories stimulated electrically by Penfield had been un- available in normal recall! In addition to this the stimulated experiences seemed to be far more specific and accurate than normal conscious recall which tends to be a generalisation. It is Penfield's belief that the brain records every item to which it pays conscious attention, and that this record is basically permanent although it may be 'forgotten' in day-to-day living. That brings us roughly up to date! Looking back over history, we see that real thinking in this area has been going on for only a little over two thousand years years, and that for as many as 1,500 of those 2,000 years virtually no advances were made. In fact only a few hundred years of progressive thought have passed, and during those years man has progressed from thinking of memory in terms of spirits and vague concepts, to tracking it down to a fairly small area in the body. But even now he is still only at the beginning of his search. Every month more than 80 new articles are published from the major research centres in the world. It may not be long before final and dramatic breakthroughs are made. 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE MEMORY TEST Few people ever put their memory to the immediate test, and it is for this reason that most are unaware of the limits and habits of their mind's work.

Do not worry about poor performance, since it is the purpose of this book to make the memorisation of all items in the following tests an easy and enjoyable exercise. Looking at this situation from a positive point of view, the more difficulty you experience now, the greater will be your improvement by the time you have completed this book!

The method is known as the Link method, and is the most basic of all the systems—the ideas and methods that you use when applying this system will prove invaluable in mastering the more sophisticated systems. 'Link' can be considered to be the key word in memory, another word for it being 'association'. Before going into the details of the link system, I shall say something about the principle of association and its connection with the entire field of Memory. As I mentioned in the introduction, psychologists have come to the conclusion that we remember things by joining a certain part of them with other things. For example, on returning to an old home or your old school, you may have realised that seeing a certain picture on the wall, or a certain piece of furniture, etc., made you 'suddenly remember' things that you would otherwise, have entirely forgotten. Your mind was linking all the ideas and memories that had been associated with the object at which you were looking. This principle applies, no matter how complicated the memory situation is. Even when remembering complicated mathematical formulas or very abstract ideas, there is a link in the background which triggers the memory you want. It is this basic concept that we shall make use of throughout the book, using methods that enable the mind to link or associate far more readily than it would otherwise have been able to. Without further ado let us apply the link method of remem- bering to a simple shopping list. In a rushed moment, and with no paper or writing instruments nearby, you have been asked to buy the following items: 27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1. Bananas 2. Soap   ' 3. Eggs 4. Drinking glasses 5. Bandages 6. Matches 7. Washing up liquid 8. Toothpaste 9. Shoes 10. Tomatoes Most people when given a list quickly like this manage to remember six or seven of the items. If you haven't already spent some time trying to remember the list, close your eyes now without looking at the list again, and see how many you can recall, giving yourself extra credit if you remember the correct order! The link method makes it all so much easier! Instead of frantically trying to remember everything randomly, you must quickly and decisively link the objects with each other. In die list that we have set out to learn this can be done as follows: Bananas and Soap are both items commonly used in jokes about people falling on their behinds! Immediately imagine yourself therefore stepping on a banana peel with your right foot and a bar of soap with your left foot, causing you to fall down. What happens when someone falls down?—He breaks things! Rather than making our memory device into a medical catalogue, we remember the next two items on our list by picturing eggs in our right hand and glasses in our left hand, both of which get broken during the fall. Our first four items are now firmly linked together. How do we link the rest? Again the task is quite easy; bandages are used for cuts which are caused by broken glass. Our next item, matches, can be linked with the idea of a bandage if we think of one of those long rolled bandages, the end of which has been set alight and is slowly burning. Matches! Having created a mental fire we had better put it out! And what better device than a fire extinguisher, or a container of washing up liquid which we mentally 'put' in the fire extin- guisher's place. 28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The next item on our list, toothpaste, can easily be linked with die washing up liquid as they both come from containers which have to be squeezed. Simply imagine a fire-extinguisher- soap-container beginning to squirt toothpaste instead of soap. We can move rapidly onto the next item by picturing the toothpaste no longer being squirted at the fire, but being badly aimed and covering our freshly polished shoes which were about to step on a rotten tomato anyway! And there we have it: our list often items neatly associated: we slip on the bananas and soap, break the eggs and drinking glasses, and need bandages which are set alight by matches. The resulting fire is then put out by washing up liquid which is similar to squeezing toothpaste which goes all over our clean shoes which were about to squash a tomato! The system is easy, but you might have already thought 'Ah yes, it might work for that list, but what happens when I have to memorise my own?*. In fact it will be just as easy for you to make up your own, and eventually even easier, if you follow these simple rules: 1. Exaggerate your associations 2. Move your associations. 3. Substitute your associations. 4. Be Absurd! 1. Exaggerate Your Associations Items are remembered far more easily if they are pictured in your mind's eye as being much greater than they really are. For example when you pictured yourself slipping on the banana peel and the bar of soap, your remembering task would have been made easier if you imagined a banana peel the size of a ski, and a bar of soap as large as a boulder. 2. Move Your Associations Whenever you are establishing links include if possible, movement or action. By doing this you create images which are\"; far more alive. The movement in your image helps to nudge the picture back into consciousness. Imagine for example how much more difficult our shopping list would have been to memorise if we had not used the idea of falling, breaking, bleeding, burning, squirting, and squashing! Action and move- ment always make remembering not only easier, but also more enjoyable. 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"3. Substitute Your Associations The art of remembering well relies on a number of factors, and it is advisable, especially in associations which you might feel are a little weak, to bring all your weapons to the fore. By substituting one thing for another you can often very strongly reinforce a link that might have been not quite strong enough. An example of this was our substitution of the fire extinguisher for the washing-up liquid container. The substitution itself made the association and the movement links more complete, and thus more readily recalled. 4. Be Absurd! Remembering is one area where you can really 'let yourself go'! There is no point at all in being conservative about the links you form—in fact the more conservative and retiring you are, the weaker your associations will be, and the worse your memory! Whenever you are trying to associate anything with anything else, think up the most extraordinary and outrageous combina- tion you can, and you will find it will last much longer. In day- to-day living you will find the same principle works. It is never the humdrum, mundane, ordinary events that catch one's attention; it is the exciting, new and unusual events which do so. And even if somebody does mention the uninteresting or boring, doesn't he always commence his statement with 'It was the most extraordinarily boring ...' or 'The most deadly dull ...'? In other words it is those events which stand out which are remembered (even if they stand out because of their mediocrity!). As a final note, and in a hushed breath, I feel obliged to mention that associations using some form of vulgar or sexual imagery are for many people among the strongest form. In view of this, and if a sexual image seems appropriate, do not hesitate to use it. Just be sure your imagination doesn't run away with itself! 33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE MEMORY SYSTEM 2 THE NUMBER-SHAPE SYSTEM In the last chapter we established the ground-work for all our memory systems. We learned that memory is a linking process and that it can be aided by exaggeration, by movement, by substitution, and by being absurd. We now move on to the first of the Peg memory systems. A Peg memory system differs from the link system in that it uses a special list of items which never change, and to which the items you wish to remember are joined or linked. A Peg system can be thought of as a clothes cabinet which contains a number of hooks for hanging clothes on. The hooks never change, but the clothes which are hung on the hooks can be infinitely varied. The first system we shall use is a fairly short one which uses the numbers from 1 to 10. It would, of course, be possible for me to give you the system outright, but it will be far more valuable if you create most of it yourself. I shall therefore explain exactly how to construct the system, and shall then progress to its practical use. The first Peg system, which we shall call the Number- Shape system, requires initially that you think of a noun which you are reminded of by the actual shape of the number. For example, and to make your task a little easier, the memory word that most people associate with the number 2 is swan, because the number resembles very closely the shape of a swan. I shall list the numbers from 1-10, leaving a blank beside each number for you to pencil in the words which you think best approximate the shape of the other nine numbers. These words will be your constant memory hooks, so try to make sure that they are good visual images—words to which you will be able to join other ideas without too much difficulty. Give yourself not more than five minutes to complete the list from 1-10, and even if you find some numbers impossible, don't worry, just read on! 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Number Number shape memory word 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Many readers will have realised while making up their Number-Shape memory words that what they were doing was using their creative imagination, while at the same time using the basic concept of linking! In other words, you were taking two basically unconnected items, a number and an object, and associating them by substituting the idea of shape. You will probably have come up with words similar to the following: 1 Pole, pencil, pen, straw, penis 2 Swan, duck. 3 Double-chin, breasts, mole-hills 4 Table, swastika, sail 5 Hook, pregnant woman 6 Golf club, cherry 7 Fishing line, cliff, boomerang 8 Bun, hourglass, shapely woman 9 Flag, sperm, tadpole, 10 Bat and ball, Laurel & Hardy Now, having worked out your own memory words, and having seen some other suggestions, I want you to select the Number-Shape memory word which for you is the best one. When you have done this print it large and clear in the box below, and put a large X through each of the previous lists. From now on you will be interested only in the words you have selected, and should forget the other choices. 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Now I want you to test yourself! Close your eyes and mentally run through the numbers from 1 -10 in order. As you come to each number mentally link it with the final Number- Shape memory word you have selected. When you have done this run through the numbers in reverse order, again linking them with your chosen word, and finally pick out numbers randomly and as quickly as you can, Unking the words to the numbers. Do this exercise now. If you managed to do this fairly successfully, you have already accomplished a memory feat which most people would find difficult, if not impossible. And what is more you will find that these associations will be so strong it will not only be easy to remember them, it will be almost impossible to forget them! The use of this system is quite simple, and involves of course the idea of Unking. Suppose we have a list of ten items that we wish to remember not simply by Unking, but in numerical order, reverse numerical order, and random numerical order. The simple link system introduced in Chapter 2 would help us somewhat with the numerical order, but would certainly leave us straining to rattle-off reverse order and random order! The Peg system leaves us with no such problem. Let us put it to the test. You have been asked to remember the following list of items: 36 Number Final number shape memory word 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"1. telephone 2. farmer 3. waterfall 4. aeroplane 5. meat 6. apple 7. teapot 8. rocks 9. bicycle 10. hatpin To remember these items in order all that it necessary is to link them with the appropriate Number-Shape memory word. Remember that when you link them the associations should be exaggerated, should be moving where possible, and should be absurd. Give yourself not more than three minutes to compete your memorisation of these items, and then test yourself as you did when you were creating the system. That is, mentally run through the items in order, in reverse order, and random order. Start this exercise now. As a guide to those readers who might have had a little difficulty, the following are examples of possible associations: 1. For telephone you might have imagined an enormous telephone pole being toppled, with a giant telephone either on top of it or being broken by it; or a telephone with the receiver which turned into a large pencil or pen every time the phone rang. 2. For farmer you could have pictured him being attacked by a giant swan or duck, or riding fairy-tale-style on one of these giant birds. 3. The waterfall could have been cascading down an enormous double chin, over a woman's very ample bosom, or onto molehills which were flattened by the water's force. 4. Aeroplane can be remembered by imagining it covered with swastikas, crashing into an enormous table, or being absurdly propelled by means of a giant sail. 5. Meat fits very nicely onto a large hook, or a pregnant woman can be thought of as 'meaty'! 6. If golf club was your choice for number 6 then you can imagine teeing off at an apple instead of a golf ball; or the apple might be thought of as a giant mutation on a cherry tree. 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"7. Your fishing line could be cast into an enormous teapot; or you might be pouring tea over a cliff instead of into a cup; or a neatly placed teapot could be imagined being knocked off the table by a boomerang. 8. Buns (as they often are!) could become rocks; the hour- glass could be enormous, passing rocks instead of sand for telling the time; or a shapely women might have her shape ruined because her clothes were stuffed with rocks. 9. The bicycle could be imagined as having an enormous Union Jack on the front which obscured the rider's vision caus- ing him to wobble all over the road; it would be imagined (substituted for) a sperm racing to conception; or it could be imagined ploughing through a swamp filled with enormous tadpoles. 10. And finally the bat of the bat and ball could be thought of as a large hatpin; or some typical Laurel and Hardy prank with a hatpin could be imagined. The examples I have given here are of course only examples, but they are included to indicate the kind of creative thinking that is necessary to establish the most effective memory links. I am sure that many of you will have devised some excellent associations, and what is necessary now is that you practise this system, and make sure that your ten Number-Shape memory words are completely second-nature to you. One of the best ways to make sure of this is to test yourself with members of your family or with friends. Ask them to make up a list of any ten items, and to read them to you with about a five-second pause between each item. The second they have spoken the word make your association, consolidating it before they reach the next one. You (and they!) will be amazed at the ease with which you can remember the items, and it is most impressive when you are able to repeat them in reverse and random order. Do not worry about getting previous lists of items confused with new ones. As I mentioned before this little Peg system can be compared to coat hooks—you simply remove one association and replace it with another! In the next chapter I shall be introducing another small system similar to this one. The two can then be combined to enable you to remember, just as easily as you have remembered ten items, twenty items!

Because of the knowledge you are building up as you go along these systems will be introduced without too much preliminary explanation as the principles already discussed are common to all of them. The Number-Sound system is almost identical to the Number-Shape system except that (and this you may have already guessed.) we think of nouns or noun-verbs which are similar in sound to the number. As in Chapter 3 I am going to list the numbers from 1-10, leaving a blank beside each number for you to pencil in the rhyming images which you think are best for each number. Make sure that the images will be good memory hooks for you. As an aid, the word which nearly everyone uses for number 5 is 'hive', the images being associated with this varying from one enormous bumble bee leaving the hive to a sky-covering swarm of monster bees!

Spend about five minutes on this exercise now. This list can be used in exactly the same way as the Number- Shape list, although many of you will have already realised that in a way you already possess the ability to remember 20 objects in and out of sequence! All you have to do is to establish one of these two Peg systems as the numbers from 1-10, letting the other represent the numbers from 11-20. Let us put this to the test. You will remember (I hope!) that Chapter 1 contained two tests, each of which asked you to remember 20 items. The first of these tests could have been adequately done by using the Link system, but the second was more difficult and required some form of Peg memory system. Let us then apply our present knowledge to the more difficult of these two tests.  < Decide which of the two Peg systems is to be first, and which, second and then give yourself not more than four minutes to remember the list When your four minutes are up, close or cover the book and then write down your answers in the same way as you did in the original test.

The only way to overcome this is to practise and practise still more. Tonight and tomorrow throw yourself in at the deep end, testing yourself whenever possible, and having as many of your friends and acquaintances as you can try to catch you out on lists that they make up for you to remember. On the first few tries you will probably make a few errors but even so, you will be performing far beyond the average person's capacity. If you persevere, you will soon be able to fire back lists without any hesitation, and without any fear of making mistakes! 43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE MEMORY SYSTEM 4 THE CLASSICAL ROOM SYSTEM Before moving on to two of the more major Peg systems, you shall have a light and easy day's work with a simple little Room system. In the section dealing with the history of memory, I men- tioned that the Romans accepted without question the theore- tical ideas of memory introduced by the Greeks. I added that one of their major contributions was the introduction and development of memory systems. One of their most popular systems made use of objects in a room. Such a system is easily constructed. Try to imagine an enormous room with a door. Now fill this room with as many items of furniture and other objects as you wish—each item of furniture will serve as a link word. Don't make a mental rubbish-dump of it, though! Your objects should be very precisely ordered. For example, you may decide to start on the immediate right of the door as you enter the room, placing there a finely carved coffee-table, on which you might put anything from a statue to an attractive lamp. Next to this you could have an antique sofa, and so on. You can see that the possibilities are almost limitless—but make sure that your objects are memorisable and that you can keep them mentally placed in the right order. How is such a system used? When you are given a list of objects you wish to remember in order (it being not necessary to remember reverse, random, or numerical order), you simply associate the items to be remembered with the objects in your room. Suppose, for instance, that your first three items were 'oil', 'insect', and 'girl'. Using the examples given, the oil could be imagined flowing all over the coffee table, the insect could be enlarged and perched on top of the statue or could be flying around the lamp, and the girl could be draped seduct- ively on the sofa! 44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"YOUR CLASSICAL MEMORY ROOM 45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The advantage of this system is that it is entirely your own, that the room may be as large as you wish, may have as many walls as you care to imagine, and may contain a great number of memory-peg objects. On the blank page provided here you should now construct your own room, selecting the shape you feel is best, and then finally printing in the objects with which you are going to furnish it. When you have completed this task, take a number of mental walks around the room until you are completely familiar with the order and arrangement of things. As with the previous memory systems, practise alone and with friends, until your system is firmly established. In the next chapter I shall be introducing the Alphabet system, which will enable you to remember more than 20 items."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX MEMORY SYSTEM 5 THE ALPHABET SYSTEM The Alphabet system is another Peg system similar in construc- tion to the Number-Shape and Number-Sound systems; but instead of using numbers, it uses the 26 letters of the alphabet. Its advantage is that it enables you to remember 26 objects, its only disadvantage being that most people find it hard to reel off the alphabet in reverse order, or to know immediately the number order of a given letter in the alphabet. As with the two number systems, I suggest you first con- struct your own list, then compare it with alternative sugges- tions, and finally select your own list to be entered in the memory box. The method of constructing your Alphabet memory system is as follows: Select a word that starts with the actual sound of the letter, is visually outstanding, and comes first in the dictionary. For example, for the letter 'L' it would be possible to use elastic, elegy, elephant, elbow, and elm, etc. If you were looking up these words in the dictionary, the first one you would come to would be elastic, and that is therefore the word you would choose. The reason for this rule is that if you should ever forget your alphabet word, you can mentally flick through the letters in order, rapidly arriving at the correct word. In the example given, if you had forgotten your word, you would try el'a' and would immediately be able to recall your first word—elastic! Another rule in the construction of the Alphabet memory system is that if the letter itself makes a word (for example 'I' makes 'eye') then that word should be used. In some cases it is possible to use meaningful initials instead of complete words, for example D.D.T. I have listed the letters of the alphabet. Paying close atten- tion to the rules for constructing the system, pencil in your own Alphabet system words. 47"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Letter Alphabet memory word A B C D ..................

Many people have difficulty in constructing an Alphabet memory system, because they tend to be far more visual- than sound-oriented.

As before cross out your own list and the list of suggestions when you have finished with them. A Ace,—those of you with knowledge of American history might use Abe. B Bee—the letter makes a word; this is the word that should be used. C See—the same rule applies. D Deed (legal)—the initials D.D.T. may be preferable. E Easel F Effigy G Jeep, or gee-gee! H H-bomb I Eye J Jay—a gaily coloured member of the crow family. K Cage L Elastic, or elbow if you pronounce elastic with a long 'e'. M Ember N Enamel O Oboe P Pea—first alphabetically! Q Queue R Arch S Eskimo T Tea—or perhaps T-square. U U-boat—'you' is too vague V Vehicle, or the initials V.D. W Wolf—the sound here is difficult; the initials W.G can be used instead.

Each of these systems can be used either independently or in conjunction with another system. Furthermore, one or two of the systems can be set aside, if you wish, as 'constant memory banks'. That is, if you have certain lists or orders of items that you will need to be able to recall over a period of a year or more, you can set aside the system of your choice for this purpose. Before moving on to the broader systems, however, I want to introduce you to a simple and intriguing method for instantly doubling any of the systems you have so far learned! When you have reached the end of a system but still wish to add further associations, all you have to do is to go back to the beginning of your system and imagine your association word exactly as you usually imagine it, with the exception that it is contained in a huge block of ice ! This simple device will drastically change the association pictures you have formed, and will double the effectiveness of your system by giving you the original list plus the original list in its new context. For example, if your first key in the Number-Shape system was 'telephone pole', you would imagine that same telephone pole either buried in the heart of your giant block, or protrud- ing from the corners or sides; if your first word in the Number- Sound system was 'sun', then you could imagine its fierce rays melting the edges of the ice block in which it was contained; if your first word in the Alphabet system was ace then you could imagine a giant playing card either frozen in the centre or forming one of the six sides of the ice cube. Practise this technique. You will find it extraordinarily helpful."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT MEMORY SYSTEM 6 SKIPNUM Skipnum (Self-Coding Instant Phonetic Number Memory grid!) is an entirely new memory system. It was developed by my close friend and associate Heinz Norden, the well-known writer, translator and polymath. Skipnum differs from other major memory systems in that it is based almost entirely on phonetics. The system is based on two elements everyone knows: 1, The initial letter of the memory word is the same as the initial letter of the number which is attached to that word. For example the numbers from 60 to 69 all begin with an 's', and therefore so do the memory words for the numbers from 60 to 69. 2. The vowel sound of the memory word is the same as the vowel sound of the unit digit in the number for which we are making the word. For example let us take the number 42. The first letter in our memory word must be an 'f because 42 begins with an 'f'. The next sound in our memory word must be '00' because the digit number in 42 is two, and its vowel sound is '00'. That means we have 'foo' which we can easily make into a word by adding either T or 'd' giving us 'fool' or 'food'. Let us try another example. The number we wish to create a memory word for is 91. The first letter is 'n'. The digit number in 91 is 1, and its vowel sound is 'uh'. To complete our memory word for 91 we simply have to complete 'nuh'. A 't' or an 'n' completes this most satisfactorily giving us 'nut' or 'nun'. There are a few exceptions to these two basic rules, but they are logical and easily remembered. 1. Ten to nineteen. These numbers do not of course have the same initial consonant. They are however collectively the 'tens' or 'teens' and therefore we use the letter 't' for these numbers. 2. Twenty to twenty-nine. A full set of memory words 53"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"beginning with 'tw' is not available so 'tr' is used instead. We can remember this fairly easily by recalling that children often confuse 'tr' and 'tw'. 3. Fifty to fifty-nine. We cannot use 'f' as the initial letter because we have already used it for forty. Instead we use 'h' because it stands for 'half', and fifty is halfway between 0 and 100. 4. Seventy to seventy-nine. In the same way that we could not use 'f' for fifty because we had already used it for forty, we cannot use V for seventy because we have already used it for sixty. This is overcome easily by using the second consonant of seventy, i.e. 'v'. 5. Eighty to eighty-nine. There is no initial consonant here so instead we use the first consonant in the word eighty, which is 'g'. 6. Vowel sound for nine. We cannot use the 'i' sound for nine because we have already used it for five. Instead we use one of the most common remaining vowel sounds (which is contained in the word vowel!) 'ow'. 7. 00-09. These are included in the Skipnum grid for convenience, because these two-digit units occur frequently in telephone numbers and elsewhere. We use the initial conso- nant 'b' because it is easy to remember when we think of 007, James Bond! Before reading on, have a quick look at the memory grid in this Chapter, trying to familiarise yourself with the ideas that have so far been explained. The grid is laid out simply and dearly, and should not be hard to follow. You have noticed from looking at the grid that a preferred memory word is given in bold It is usually the simplest possible word formed by the above two rules, and is preferably one that can be used both as a verb and a noun. If possible it should have more than one meaning, and should be able to serve as a connector in making phrases from the memory words. Vulgar, action and emotionally charged words are also prefer- able because they are easier to remember. Where they arise, silent initial letters such as 'g' 'k' 'w' and 'y' are ignored in the memory words. Since more than one word can often be formed within the boundaries of the rule, alternate words may be used. Some of these are given in the Skipnum grid for you to choose from. This possibility of alternate words is particularly useful in 54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"situations where you might be trying to remember a long number which contains the same two-digit sequence more than once. You don't have to repeat the same word, but can use another word representing the same number! Another advantage of this memory system is that you don't have to learn the memory words by heart since they are 'self coding'. They will pop into your mind instantly as long as you know the rules! Up to this point in the Chapter you have been given a lot of detailed information which at the moment you may have found a little bit difficult to absorb completely. It is advisable now to review quickly the entire Chapter, consolidating those areas which have given you some trouble. To assist you in further consolidation, I have randomly listed the numbers from 1-100 on the next two pages so that you can readily test yourself in either remembering the words on the grid or 'self coding' your own.

In every walk of life, every level of occupation, and every social situation, there are literally millions of people who say they 'just can't remember' the people they meet. In business and the professions this can be most embarrass- ing. If you are at a conference, attending a course, or involved in any situation in which you are meeting new people, it is not only embarrassing to be unable to remember the names and faces of those who are with you, it can also be a serious handi- cap when you meet them again. Even should you not have occasion to meet them again, the ability to remember names and faces without seeing them may be useful when you are 'mentally thumbing through' people who might be of assist- ance to you. In a social setting, the inability to remember the names and faces of people you meet is a discomforting and unpleasant experience. Many people devise little tricks and methods for evading the issue! One of the favourites is to ask for the person's name, and when he replies with his Christian name to say 'Oh, I knew that! it was your surname I had difficulty remembering', and of course if he replies with his surname 'Oh I knew that ! it was your Christian name I had difficulty remembering'! The disadvantages of this little technique are two-fold: Even if it works you have had to admit that at least in part you had forgotten his name; and secondly, many people reply immed- iately with both their Christian and surnames! Another device commonly used by people who have forgot- ten a name is to say something like 'Oh, I am sorry, but how was it that you spelled your name?' This of course can work in situations where a person has a name like Pattlesserie Zhytni- ewski! But when the retort is a sarcastic 'J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H' you can be made to look a little silly! 59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"These tricks are nothing more than tricks, and apart from the obvious pitfalls I have mentioned they inevitably leave the person who is using them in an insecure and uncomfortable position. Aware of his inadequacy, he tends to be afraid that his tricks won't work or that he will be placed in a situation where they will be inappropriate and his poor memory will be on full view! Tricks, then, are not enough. At the other end of the scale from the person who 'just can't remember' names and faces, is that well-known person who always does remember. At school it might have been a particu- lar teacher (or the headmaster ! ); at university a well-known professor, and in business a successful manager. Whatever the situation I am sure you will confirm the fact that the person was socially confident, generally successful, and almost certainly well-known. I remember well the first class I ever attended at university. It was an eight-in-the-morning English lecture, and the excitement of the first day and the first class had not quite managed to shake off the sleepiness from most of the students. Our professor had! He strode into the room with no brief- case and no books, stood in front of the class, announced his name, and then said he would call the attendance. He started alphabetically, listing off names such as Abrahamson, Adams, Ardlett, and Bush, in response to which he got the usual mumbled 'Yes, sir' and 'Here, sir'. When he came to Cartland, however, there was no reply. He paused for a moment and then said 'Mr. John Cartland'. To which there was still no reply. Without change of expression he then said 'Mr. John W. P. Cartland?' and proceeded to list the boy's birthday, address, and telephone number! There was still no reply so our professor (who by this time had thoroughly awakened the class!) carried on with the remaining names. Each time he arrived at the name of a person who was absent he called out that persons initials, birthday, address and telephone number! When he had completed the roster and everyone sat with jaws hanging open, he repeated very rapidly the names of all the students who were absent and said, with a wry smile on his face, 'I'll make a note of them some time!' He never forgot one of us, either! From that day on he became a legend, for none of us could imagine or hope to compete with the brilliance of a mind that could so completely and perfectly remember names and dates. 60"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"We were, of course, mistaken. Using the proper memory system, the kind of performance that our professor gave is by no means an impossibility, and is in fact quite simple. In this chapter I shall introduce you to the systems and techniques that make remembering of names, faces and related facts a relatively simple and certainly a rewarding task. Before getting down to the specific methodology, there are a few rules that should be observed, even when one is not using special memory systems. These rules or pointers apply mostly to situations in which you are meeting new people. The pointers rely on one of the most important factors in memory: Repetition. When you are introduced to somebody first make sure you listen. Many people actually 'turn off' when they are intro- duced to people and haven't the faintest idea what the name of the person is to whom they have just been introduced! Second, request that the name be repeated even if you have heard it. Most people tend to mumble introductions and even if an introduction is clear no one will be disturbed if you ask for a repetition. Third, repeat the name when you have been given it the second time. Rather than saying simply 'how do you do?' add the name to the end of your greeting: 'how do you do, Mr. Rosenthal'. Fourth, if the name is at all difficult, politely ask for the spelling. Fifth, if the situation seems to warrant it ask the person something about the background and history of his name. Contrary to what you might expect most people will be flattered by your interest, and pleased that you have taken the trouble to enquire about their name and remember it. Carrying the principles of repetition and involvement further, make sure that during conversations with people you newly meet you repeat the name wherever possible. This repetition helps to implant the name more firmly in your memory, and is also socially more rewarding, for it involves the other person more intimately in the conversation. It is far more satisfying to hear you say 'yes, as Mr. Jones has just said ...' than to hear you say 'yes, as this chap over here as just said...'! And finally of course when you are taking leave of those you S.M. —4  61"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"have met make sure you say, rather than just an impersonal farewell, 'good evening, Mr. Jones'. These aids to memory are, as I mentioned, useful to the person who is not using memory systems as well as one who is, although they are naturally far more beneficial to the latter, because he has additional 'artillery' which he can use to back himself up. Without further ado, let us learn the system for remembering faces and names. To begin with, we must become far more observant of the faces we wish to remember! Many people, especially those who have a poor memory for names and faces, have great difficulty in remembering how one face differs from another, and find it almost impossible to describe the individual characteristics of faces. Our first task then is to become more observant. To aid you in this the next few pages will give you a 'guided tour' from the top of the head to the tip of the chin, enumer- ating the various characteristics and the ways in which they can be classified and typified. You may well be surprised at just how varied faces can be! HEAD AND FACIAL CHARACTERISTICS 1. The Head Usually you will first- meet a person face-on, so before deal- ing with the run-down of separate characteristics we will consider the head as a whole. Look for the general shape of the entire bone structure. You will find that this can be: a. Large b. Medium c. Small And that within these three categories the following shapes can be found: a. square b. rectangular c. round d. oval e. triangular, with the base at the chin and the point at the scalp f. triangular with the base and the scalp and the point at the chin 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"g. broad h. narrow i. big-boned j. fine-boned You may, fairly early in your meeting, see the head from the side and will be surprised at how many different shapes heads seen from this view can take: a. square b. rectangular c. oval d. broad e. narrow f. round g. flat at the front h. flat on top i. flat at the back j. domed at the back k. face angled with jutting chin and slanted forehead 1. face angled with receding chin and prominent forehead 2. The Hair In earlier days, when hairstyles used to be more consistent and lasting, hair served as a better memory hook than it does now. The advent of dyes, sprays, wigs, and almost infinitely varied styles makes identification by this feature a somewhat tricky business! Some of the more basic characteristics, however, can be listed as follows: Men a. thick b. fine c. wavy d. straight e. parted f. receding g. bald h. cropped i. medium j. long k. frizzy 1. colour (only in notable cases) 63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Women a. thick b. thin c. fine Because of the variability in women's hairstyles it is not advisable to try to remember them from this characteristic! 3. Forehead Foreheads can be generally divided into the following categories: a. high b. wide c. narrow between hairline and eyebrows d. narrow between temple and temple e. smooth f. lined horizontally g. lined vertically 4. Eyebrows a. thick b. thin c. long d. short e. meeting at the middle f. spaced apart g. flat h. arched i. winged j. tapered 5. Eyelashes a. thick b. thin c. long d. short e. curled f. straight 6. Eyes a. large b. small c. protruding 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"d. deep-seated e. close together f. spaced apart g. slanted outwards h. slanted inwards i. coloured j. iris—entire circle seen k. iris—circle covered partly by upper and/or lower lid Attention may also be paid in some cases to the lid above and the bag below the eye, both of which can be large or small, smooth or wrinkled, and puffy or firm. 7. The Nose When seen from the front: a. large b. small c. narrow d. medium e. wide When seen from the side: a. straight b. flat c. pointed d. blunt e. snub or upturned f. Roman or aquiline g. Greek, forming straight line with forehead h. concave (caved in) The base of the nose can also vary considerably in relation to the nostrils: a. lower b. level c. a little higher The nostrils themselves can also vary: a. straight b. curved down c. flaring 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"d. wide e. narrow f. hairy 8. Cheekbones Cheekbones are often linked very closely with the character- istics of the face when seen front-on, but the following three characteristics may often be worth noting: a. high b. prominent c. obscured 9. Ears Ears are a part of the face that few people pay attention to, and yet their individuality can be greater than any other feature. They may be: a. large b. small c. gnarled d. smooth e. round f. oblong g. triangular h. flat against the head i. protruding j. hairy k. large lobed 1. no lobe This feature is of course more appropriate as a memory hook with men than with women, because the latter usually cover their ears with hair. 10. Lips a. Long upper lip b. short upper lip c. small d. thick (bee-stung) e. wide f. thin g. upturned 66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"h. downturned i. Cupid's bow (U Thant) j. well-shaped k. ill-defined 11. Chin When seen straight on the chin may be: a. long b. short c. pointed d. square e. round f. double (or multiple) g. cleft, h. dimpled When seen from the side it will be either: a. jutting b. straight c. receding 12. Skin Finally the skin should be observed. It may be: a. smooth b. rough c. dark d. fair e. blemished or marked in some way f. oily g. dry h. blotchy i. doughy j. wrinkled k. furrowed Other characteristics of faces, specially men's, include the various and varied growth of facial hair ranging from short sideburns to the full-blooded and face-concealing beard with moustache. There is no point in listing all the variations. It should suffice to note that these hirsute phenomena do exist, 67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"but that they, like hairstyles and colours, can change dramatic- ally overnight! Having acquired all this information about the face, how do we make use of it? You may be surprised to learn that the answer is contained in the earlier chapters of the book! To put it briefly all that we have to do is the following: 1. Make a definite note of the name of the person. 2. Examine his face very carefully noting the characteristics that have been enumerated in the preceding pages. 3. Look for characteristics which are unusual, extra- ordinary, or unique. 4. Mentally reconstruct the person's face, exaggerating in the way that a caricaturist does these noteworthy features. 5. Link, using exaggeration and movement etc, where possi- ble, these outstanding features to the name of the person. The best way for you to learn the application of these methods is to practise them, so following I have doubled the number of faces and names you were asked to remember in your original test, have given suggestions for linking them, and then have rearranged the faces without names for you to test your new skills. 'An impossible task!' you might say. But before you actually test yourself on these names let's look at each person separ- ately to see what kind of associations we can make between the face and the name. Mrs. Ruff. Mrs. Ruff has a fairly distinct hairstyle which it is unlikely that a woman such as she would change. It doesn't take much imagination to change her hair into an Elizabethan ruff—the frilled neck collar common to that age. Mr. Hind has enormous jowls! As a matter of fact they look a little bit like a person's posterior! Be Hind ! Mr. Pickett. The outstanding feature of Mr. Pickett's face is it's overall rectangular quality and its straight neck. An image can conveniently be made using the type of placard that people on strike who are picketing their employers carry. To make the image more complete, you might even imagine the word 'picket' being written on the placard. Mr. Rolls is perhaps one of the easiest. His triple chin bulging in rolls beneath his face makes no other image neces- sary. Miss Shute. Attractive though she may be, Miss Shute has one of those characteristically in-curved noses, a little similar 68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Mrs. Ruff Mr. Pickett Mr. Rolls Miss Shute Mr Sawyer Mr. Hind"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Mrs. Knapp Mr. Callis Mr. Marshall Miss Hammant Mr. Dockerill Mrs. Nash"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Mr. Swallow Mr. Lynch Mrs. Cirkell Mrs. Paukowski Mr. Fieldwick Mr. Ray"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Miss Sherriton Mr. Newell Mrs. Carstairs Mr. Dombrower Mrs. Heyburn Miss Jazcolt"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"to a certain famous comedian. We can exaggerate this variously imagining a giant coal-chute, or a fairground shoot-the-chute. Mr. Sawyer. The outstanding characteristic on this man's face is his large, straight and shaggy eyebrow. With a quick mental twist we convert this into a large saw, the shaggy sections of the eyebrow representing the teeth of the saw. Mrs. Knapp. Mrs. Knapp is noticeable for the fairly large bags beneath her eyes. Concentrate on this aspect and imagine that these were caused by a lack of sleep. In other words they might go away if she were more often able to take a nap. Mr. Marshall. Fairly obviously Mr. Marshall would be noticed for his large protruding ears. To link them with his name is not as difficult as it might appear: Imagine that each ear is a gun holster! Mr. Callis. A number of features might be picked for Mr. Callis, but probably the best is his rough pock-marked skin. Our link here is the word 'callous', which refers to a hardened or rough area on the body's surface. Miss Hammant. Two features should immediately strike you about Miss Hammant. First her beefy, strong face, and second her rather small nose. The caricature is easy: make the beef into a large ham; make the small nose into an ant crawling over the ham. Mr. Dockerill. Mr Dockerill is slightly more difficult than Miss Hammant, but he is not impossible! To begin with he is a large man, which fits in with the general impression of a docker. Add to this his large eyes (like harbours !) and the first part of his name—Docker—is easily remembered. Further more he does look a little run down, many of his features tending to either droop or sag. We thus arrive at 'ill' and the complete Dockerill. Mrs. Nash. One of the most noticeable characteristics of Mrs. Nash is her upper lip which is drawn back, leaving her upper front teeth slightly uncovered. To remember her name we concentrate on the teeth rather than on the lip, thinking of the gnashing of teeth. Mr. Swallow. Mr. Swallow is an ideal subject! For those people to whom the word swallow immediately brings to mind images of eating or drinking he has a prominent adam's apple which can be exaggerated with ease. For those who are more inclined to ornithology his fine arched eyebrows look very much like a swallow in flight! 73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Mrs. Cirkell. Again an easy one! With this face we need not be concerned with particular characteristics—simply the overall shape which is circular circle—Cirkell. Mr. Lynch. In remembering Mr. Lynch let us try a different approach. We will think first of a lynching, realising that it concentrates on the neck! Next we will link this image with our man. Mr. Lynch has a particularly thick neck so we imagine an especially strong rope being needed to complete the job! Mrs. Paukowski. Of Mrs. Paukowski's major features, one of the most outstanding is her large, sloping forehead. To remember her name we convert this into an enormous ski- slope, and imagine (here we have to get really ridiculous, which is good!) a poverty striken cow skiing or attempting to ski down the slope: poor-cow-ski! Mr. Fieldwick. Another person whose memory-feature is to be the forehead. Mr. Fieldwick's forehead is noticeable not for its size or shape, but for the wrinkles and creases upon it. Imagine it therefore as a ploughed field. His tufty hair can be likened to a candle-wick. A field above which there is a wick. Mr. Ray. This young man is noticeable not so much for any particular feature, but for the general quality that emanates from his face. It seems almost to glow. A quick mental trip takes us from 'glow' to 'gleam' to 'ray'. Miss Sheriton. Miss Sheriton is made even more attractive than she would otherwise be by the large dimple in her chin. Think of the dimple as a large cherry, so large that it weighs a ton. A slight slurring of the 'ch' gives us 'sh' Sheriton. Mr. Newell. As with Mrs. Paukowski Mr. Newell's memory- feature is his nose, although in his case we are interested in the fact that it is slightly shiny and flared at the nostril. The shiny quality can easily be interpreted as newness, and the flared nostril can be likened to a well. Mrs. Carstairs. Rather than attempting to combine two images here we will concentrate on Mrs. Carstairs eyes which are noticeably round. The image is of a car's headlights. We need not imagine stairs, as the round eyes themselves stare. In other words we imagine: car stares! Mr. Dombrower. This intelligent looking gentleman is characteristic of the 'intellectual' or 'highbrow' look because of his large, domed forehead or brow. The link is easy: dome- brow. 74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Mrs. Heyburn. Mrs. Heyburn has lank, straight hair. Imagine it as cut hay, and then set the lot on fire! Miss Jazcolt. Miss Jazcolt has pouting lips which can quite easily be imagined playing an instrument such as the trumpet— jazz! She is also 'frisky' in appearance. just like a colt. Miss Jazzcolt. That completes our list of 24 names. Before proceeding to the following pages in which you will be testing your memory of these names, quickly run back over the list and the associa- tions, fixing them firmly in your mind. You should by now be quite an expert at remembering names and faces! Before this chapter comes to an end, how- ever, we shall quickly cover the memorisation of facts related to the names and faces we wish to remember. Now that you have basically grasped the link system and the remembering of names and faces, this next step will be quite simple. All you have to do is to add another link to the face-name picture you already have. For example, if Mrs. Ruff were a typist, you would imagine either: a typewriter within the Elizabethan ruff; typing on an Elizabethan ruff; or a typewriter sitting on Mrs. Ruff's head! If Mr. Sawyer were a college professor you could imagine him standing in front of his class sawing his desk or lecturn in two! If Mr. Swallow were an apprentice plumber you could imagine him swallowing his employer's tools, and so on! One other point about remembering people is the following: if you are certain that you will be meeting this person only once and that you are not concerned with long-term memory, it is often useful to use an outstanding item of clothing that the person might be wearing. This method of course is no good for long-term memory, as the person may not be wearing the same clothes next time. Another general pointer concerns names that are common, such as Smith and Jones. To remember people with names like these, establish a 'Smith-chain' and a 'Jones-chain' etc. To do this pick a 'basic Smith' or Jones and use that person's face as a link with any other person having the same name. You will find that the more people you have on the chain, the easier remembering becomes. And finally, how did my professor perform his amazing feat? By now the answer should be fairly apparent: firstly he used 75"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"one of the basic list systems to remember the names in the proper order, obviously making extravagant associations with the memory word and the name to be remembered. The numbers and addresses he remembered by a system with which I will be dealing in a later chapter. Once he had called our names and we had identified ourselves, the rest was easy. He linked the names with the very motley collection of faces in the class! 80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN THE MAJOR SYSTEM The Major system is the ultimate in the development of the peg systems discussed earlier. It is a system which has been in use for over 400 years, although it has been continually improved since the middle of the 17th century, when it was introduced by Stanislaus Mink von Wesnnsshein. Von Wennsshein's basic construction was modified in the early 18th century by Doctor Richard Grey, an Englishman. The system makes use of a different consonant or consonant sound for each number from zero to ten as follows: To save you the trouble of remembering these by rote, there are simple little remembering devices: 1. The letters t and d have one down stroke. 2. The letter n has two down strokes.- 3. The letter m has three down strokes. 4. The letter r is the last letter in the word four. 5. The letter 1 can be thought of as either the roman numeral for 50 or the shape of a spread hand which has five spread fingers. 6. The letter L is the mirror image of 6. 7. The letter k, when seen as a capital, contains two number sevens! S.M. —5 81 1 = t, d, th 2 = n 3 = m 4 = r 6 = j, sh, ch, dg, soft g 7 = k, ch, hard c, hard g, ng, q 8 = f,v 9 = p,b o = s, z, soft c"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"8. The letter f, when written, has two loops; similar to the number 8. 9. The letter p is the mirror image of 9. 10. s or z is the first sound of the word zero; 'o' is the last letter. As with the Number-Sound and Number-Shape systems, our task is to create a visual image that can immediately and permanently be linked with the number it represents. Let us take for example the number 1. In order to assign to it a memory word we have to think of a word that is a good visual image and that contains only 't', 'd' or 'th' and a vowel sound. Examples include 'toe', 'doe', tea', 'the' and many others. When recalling the word we had chosen for number 1, let us say 'tea', we would know that it could represent only the number 1 because the consonant letters in the word represent no other number, and vowels do not count as numbers in our system. Let us try another example: the number 34. In this case we have first the number three which is represented by the letter 'm' and then 4 which is represented by the letter 'r'. Examples can include 'more', 'moor', 'mire' and 'mare'. In selecting the 'best' word for this number you once again make use of the alphabetic dictionary-order to assist both in choice of word and in recall. The letters we have to choose are 'm' and 'r', so we simply mentally run through the vowels 'a-e-i-o-u' order using the first vowel that enables us to make an adequate memory word. The case in question is easily solved, as 'a' fits in between 'm' and V to direct us towards the word 'mare\" The advantage of using this alphabet-order system is that should a word in the major system ever be forgotten it can literally be 'worked out' from the basic information. All you have to do is to place the letters of the number in their correct order and then 'slot in' the vowels. As soon as you touch the correct combination your memory-word will immediately come to mind. Before going on, jot down the numbers from 10 to 19, letting the letter t represent in each case the '1' of the number. Next try to complete the words, using the alphabet-order system for these numbers. Don't worry if this exercise proves a little difficult, as just over the page you will find a complete list of memory words for 82"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"the numbers 1 to 100. Don't simply accept them—check each one carefully, changing any that you find difficult to visualise or for which you have a better substitute. You now possess a peg memory system for the numbers from 1 to 100—a system which contains within itself the pattern for its own memorisation! As you will have seen, this system is basically limitless. In other words, now that we have letters for the numbers 0-9, it should be possible for us to devise memory words for the numbers not only for 1 to 100 but also for the numbers from 100 to 1,000! This system could of course go on for ever but I doubt that anyone would need more than 1,000 peg words. On the pages that follow I have devised a list of key memory peg words for the numbers 100 to 1,000. After certain of the more 'difficult' words I have included either: 1. A suggestion for a way in which an image might be formed from the word. 2. A dictionary definition of the word, the definition includ- ing words or ideas that should help you to form your image. 3. 'New' definitions for words which place them in a humourous, or different, but certainly more memorisable form. The remaining words have blank spaces following them. In the space provided you should write in your own key words for, or ideas about, the image you will be using. In some cases, where the combination of letters makes the use of single words impossible, double words have been used such as Wo Cash' for the number 276, (n, hard c, sh). In other cases it is necessary to include vowels (which have no numerical meaning) at the beginning of the word. For example the number 394 (m, p, r) is represented by the word 'empire'. In still further cases words have been used, the first three letters only of which pertain to the number. For example the number 359 (m, 1, b) is represented by the word 'mailbag'. The final 'g' has no significance or importance. Your next task should be to check carefully this Major System list. It would obviously be too much to ask you to do this at one sitting, so I suggest the more modest goal of checking, making images for, and remembering, a hundred words each day. As you go through the list make every effort to make your images of the words as solid as you possibly can. 83"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"1. TEA 2. NOAH 3. MA 4. RAY 5. LAW 6. JAW 7. KEY 8.

Remember the four rules in the early chapter: Exaggerate; Move; Substitute; be Absurd. In cases where words are similar in concept to previous words, it is most important to make your images as different as possible. The same caution applies to words which are pluralised because of the addition of V. In these cases imagine an enormous number of the items as opposed to a single enormous item. You will find your consolidation of the words in the major system useful not only because it will enable you to remember the astounding number of 1,000 items in order or randomly, but also because it will exercise your creative Unking ability which is so necessary for remembering anything. In addition, a number of the words used as mnemonics in this Major System are interesting in their own right. As you check through and memorise each list of 100, have a dictionary by your side—it will serve as a means of solidifying the images for you, will enable you to select the best possible images or words and will be of value in the improvement of your general vocabulary ! If you are also reading my book Speed Reading, combine where feasible the vocabulary exercises included in it with your exercises on the Major System. 100. Dust. 101. Design. 102. Disease. 103.

The. major system can be used, like the smaller systems, to remember' short lists. Its advantage of course is that it is limitless. It can therefore be used to store information. For example if you wish to remember a certain list of facts to which you would have to refer continually over a period of years you could memorise that list using the key words from, for example, 400 to 430. In this way you can build up a permanent library of important or interesting facts which you will never forget! The major system is not only a peg system. It is also the basis for remembering numbers, dates and telephone numbers, etc., and to these we shall shortly turn. 123"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN CARD MEMORY SYSTEM Magicians and memory experts often amaze and amuse audiences with their ability to remember complete packs of cards in the order in which they were presented. They similarly astound their audiences by being able to rattle off, without any difficulty, the six or seven cards not mentioned when an incomplete 'pack' is randomly presented. Extra- ordinary as these feats may seem, they are not all that difficult and are usually quite straightforward—even though many people accuse the performer of having hidden assistants in the audience, marked cards, and a number of other tricks! The system for remembering a complete pack of cards is similar in concept to the peg systems so far discussed. All that is necessary is to know the first letter of the word for the suit and the number of the card in that suit. For example, all words for the club cards will begin with c, all words for the hearts with h, all words for the spades with s, and all the words for the diamonds with d. The second consonant for the card-word will be the consonant repre- sented by the letter from the Major Memory System. Taking as an example the 5 of spades we know that it must begin with V because it is a spade card, and that its last consonant must be 'l' because it is the 5, and 5 is represented by 'l'. Without much difficulty we arrive at the word 'sale' which represents the 5 of spades. Taking another example, we wish to devise a word for the 3 of diamonds. The word must begin with 'd' because it is the diamond suit and its final consonant must be 'm' because 'm* is represented by the number 3 in the major system. Filling in with the first vowel we arrive at the word 'dam' which is our image word for the 3 of diamonds. Following is a list of the cards (aces count as 'one') and their memory words. A few of the variations I will explain when you have had a chance to familiarise yourself with the list. 124"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"In this system the jacks and queens have been counted as the numbers 11 and 12, and 10 as 's', and the king simply as the name of the suit in which he resides! The memory words for the clubs are in many cases the same as those for the major system words for the 70's, but this need not concern you, as the two lists will never come into conflict. How does the memory expert dazzle his audience? The answer is quite simple—whenever a card is called out he immediately associates that card with the appropriate number on his major system (you will of course be able to use mo systems for this task, as the Skipnum system also contains enough pegs to hold a full pack of cards.). 125 Clubs  Diamonds CA—Cat  DA—Date C2—Can  D2—Dane C3—Cam D3—Dam C4—Car  D4—Deer C5—Call  D5—Dale C6—Cage D6—Dash C7—Cake D7—Deck C8—Cafe  D8—Dive C9—Cab  D9—Dab Cio—Case D10—Daze CJ—Cadet  DJ—Dead wood CQ—Cotton DQ—Deaden CK—Club  DK—Diamond Hearts -  Spades HA—Hat  SA—Sot H2—Hen S2—Son H3—Ham  S3—Sum H4—Hair S4—Sore H5—Hail S5—Sale H6—Hash  S6—Sash H7—Hag  S7—Sack H8—Hoof  S8—Sage H9—Hub S9—Sap Hio—Haze Sio—Seas HJ—Headed SJ—Sated HQ—Heathen SQ—Satan HK—Heart HK—Spade"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"If for example the first card called out was the 7 of dia- monds you would associate the word 'deck' with the first word on your major system which is 'tea'. You might imagine the entire deck of a boat being covered in tea, or perhaps even the Boston Tea Party! If the next card called were the ace of hearts you would associate the word for this card—'hat'— with the second word on you memory system 'Noah' and would link these two. You could imagine Noah on the ark wearing an enormous rain-hat in order to keep off the flood! If the next card called were the queen of spades you would associate the word for that card —'satan'—with your third major system word 'Ma'. You could imagine your mother bashing satan over the head! From these few examples I hope you can see how easy it can be to memorise an entire pack of cards in whatever order they happen to be presented to you. It is a most impressive feat to be able to perform in front of your friends! Your facility in remembering cards can be taken a step further. It is possible to have someone randomly read you the names of all the cards in the deck, leaving out any six or seven he chooses. Without much hesitation you can tell him which cards these were! There are two ways of doing this, the first being to use a technique similar to that explained in Chapter 8. Whenever a card is called out you associate the image word for that card within a larger concept such as the block of ice previously mentioned. In different situations you can use a coal-cellar or a boat etc. as that in which you contain your card memory word. When all the cards have been presented you simply run down the list of card memory words noting those words which are not connected with the larger memory concept. If the 4 of clubs had been called you might have pictured a car slithering across the huge cube of ice, or being trapped within it. You could hardly forget this image but if the card 4 of clubs had not been called you would immediately remem- ber that you had nothing to remember! The other system for this type of feat is to mutate or change in some way the card memory word if that card is called. For example if the king of clubs were called and your image for this was a cave-man like club you would imagine it being broken in half. Or if the card called were the 2 of hearts and 126"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"your normal image for this was a simple farm hen you might imagine it with an extraordinarily large tail or with its head cut off! The systems described in this chapter are basic to the remembering of cards, but it does not take much to see that in the actual playing of card games, a memory system such as this can be of enormous help. You have probably watched people repeating over and over to themselves the cards which they know have been put down or which are in other players' hands, and you have probably seen them sigh with exasperation at their inability to remember accurately! With your new memory system such tasks will become only too simple! 127"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE LONG NUMBER MEMORY SYSTEM Give a long number such as 95862190377 to someone to remember and he will try: to repeat it as you present it to him, eventually getting bogged down in his own repetition; to subdivide it into two-or-three number groups, eventually losing the order and content of these; to work out mathematical relations between the numbers as you present them, inevitably getting confused; or to 'picture' the number as it is presented, the photograph in his mirid always becoming blurred! If you think back to the initial test in which you were asked to perform a feat like this, you will probably recall your own approach. Remembering long numbers is really quite simple if you apply the Major System. Instead of using this system as a word system to remember objects, it is possible to use the basic words of the system itself to recall the numbers from which they are made. Let us take the number at the top of the page. It is com- posed of: 95—ball 86—fish 21—net 90—base 37—mac 7—key In order to remember this almost impossible number all that we now have to do is to link the key words which relate to sub-sections of that number. The image-chain here could be of a large ball bouncing off the head of a fish which has just broken out of a net and fallen to the base level of the pier where it struck a man wearing a mac who was bending over to pick up his key. Recalling these words and transforming them to numbers we get: b-9 1-5 128"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"f—8 sh—6 n—2 t—1 b- 9 s—o m—3 c—7 k-7 95862190377! There is no need, of course, to remember these large numbers by taking groups of two. It is just as easy, and sometimes more easy, to consider groups of three. Let us try this with the number 851429730584. It is composed of: 851—fault 429—rainbow 730—cameos 584—lever In order to remember this number, which is slightly longer than the previous number, it is once again a matter of linking our key words. We could imagine a force which caused a break or fault in rainbow coloured cameos which are so heavy they needed a lever to move them. Recalling these words and transforming them we get: f—8 1-5 t—1 r—4 n—2 b-9 c—7 m—3 s—0 l 5 v—8 r—4 851429730584! A further system for remembering numbers such as this, especially if you have not committed the major system entirely 129"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"to memory, is to make up four-consonant words from the number you have to remember. Let us try this with a 16 digit number: 1582907191447620. From the digits we get 1582— telephone, 9071— basket, 9144— botherer, 7620— cushions. Our image chain can be of a telephone being thrown into a basket where an annoying person (a botherer!) has also been thrown with some cushions. Recalling the number should by now be a familiar process to you. To check on the amazing difference this method of number memorisation makes, go back to the original test-chapter and see how easy those initial numbers were! 130"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN TELEPHONE NUMBER MEMORY SYSTEM Most people 'just can't' remember telephone numbers! In order to overcome this disability they employ ail kinds of elaborate systems (and some not so elaborate), ranging from the person who keeps card files of the numbers he needs to re- member and carries these around with him, to the one who jots down numbers on odd pieces of paper and is continually ringing the wrong person! Remembering telephone numbers is actually not difficult at all as long as we remember the number-letter correspondence from the major system. All that is necessary is to substitute a letter for the number we wish to remember. Having done this, we make up association words that link the number to the person. Let us try this with the ten people from the initial test: Your local butcher Your dentist Your bank manager Your doctor Your local grocer Your local chemist Your tennis partner Your plumber Your local pub Your garage HSM-8737 NAH-9107 CAM-5323 HOB-3981 CEL-8801 BOT-9939 SER-4112 LEA-8519 PMB-1427 TRK-9340 In these examples we have letters as well as numbers to deal with, but these will prove of little difficulty as you shall soon see. The butcher's number—HSM-8737—starts with the letters 'HSM'. These letters can be remembered in a variety of ways, but the ones which immediately spring to mind are: 'He. Sells .Meat' and 'Ham, Sausages, .Mince'. The numbers we have to deal with are 8737 which can be converted to 'v or 131"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"f 'k, c, g' 'm' and 'k,c,g'. Our task here is to make up either one word which contains these letters in order, two short words which also contain these letters in order or four words, the initial letter of which represents the number we are trying to remember. In the case of the butcher the last of these choices is probably the best. We select v, g, m, and hard c to give us ' V ery G ood M eat C uts'. We could of course, substi- tute 'Fairly' for 'Very' and 'Gory' for 'Good' etc. As practice on these items is always important, take a quick look again at the people and their numbers, noting the letters. When you have practised them, consider the following sugges- tions for each one—I am sure that many of you will be able to create some most original methods! Your dentist—NAH-9107. The initial letters 'NAH' could form the phrase Weedles Always Hurt' or Wasty And H orrible!' The letters we have to choose from are (9107) 'p,b', 't,d', 's,z, or soft c', and 'k,g. hard c etc.'. One two-word com- bination that we might use for this is 'Bad Suck' because people with toothaches often tend to suck at the painful tooth. A four word suggestion of a more positive nature is 'Pain Does Certainly Go' (or 'Come' if you still feel none too kindly toward your dentist!). Your bank manager—CAM-5923. The letters might be used in the phrases ' C ash And . M oney' or, if he has just refused you a loan, ' C rabby And M ean!' The numbers translate to the letters 'l', 'm', 'n', 'm' which in view of the second phrase, might well be translated into 'Lent Me No Money!' Your doctor—HOB-3981. The initial letters could be remembered either by 'HOB ble' or ' H eals O ur B acks (or .Bones)'. The numbers translate to 'm', 'p,b', 'f,v' and 't,d,th'. An obvious linking phrase is ' M akes P ain F eel B etter'. Your local grocer—CEL-8801. The letters fit neatly into the word ' CEL lery', or with a bit of a stretch, into 'Cabbages, . E xtra L eafy'. The numbers translate to the letters 'f,v', 'f,v', 's, z soft c', and 't,d,th'. A phrase from this is ' V ery F ine Celery and Tomatoes'. The initial word could be changed to 'Fairly' or 'Few' and the second to ' F owl!'. Your local chemist—BOT-9939. The initial letters could be remembered either as the first three of the word ' BOT tle' or as the first letters of ' B ottles O f T oxins!' or 'Boxes Of Tissues'. The numbers translate to 'p,b', 'p,b' 'm', and 'p,b. A sug- 132"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"gested four word phrase is 'Potions, Poisons, Medicines and Pills'. Your tennis partner—SER-4112. The initial letters can be remembered as the first three letters of the word 'SERve'. The numbers translate to the letters 'r', 't,d,th', 't,d,th', and 'n'. Our memory phrase here might be '. R arely T ouches T he Net'. Your plumber—LEA-8519. As with the grocer and tennis partner the first three letters fit conveniently into the word 'LEAk!. The numbers translate to the letters 'f,v', ' l ' , 't,d,th', and 'p,b'. Our memory phrase could either be 'Fixes Leaks, Drips and Plumbing' or 'Faulty Lines, Taps and Pipes'. Your local pub—PMB 1427. The initial letters are difficult to make into a word, but can be used in such three letter phrases as ' P ublicans M anage B eer'. The numbers translate to 't,d,th', 'r', 'n', and 'k, g, hard c etc' In this case there is no need to make up a phrase—we can contain it all in the one word 'Drink'. Your garage—TRK 9340. As with the number section of the telephone number of your local pub this group of letters need not be made into separate words. The word 'TRuCK' perfectly conveys the first three letters. The number translates to 'p,b' 'm', 'r', and 's,z, soft c'. This can be put into the phrase ' B roken M otor R epair S ervice'. The examples given above are of course very particular, and it will now be up to you to apply the system outlined to the telephone numbers which are important for you to remember. In some cases the telephone number may have no letters in it at all, as may soon be the general case in Britain when the all-digit number system is completely introduced. This will present no extra difficulty, as you simply have three initial numbers instead of three initial letters, and these three numbers themselves will be translatable into letters. In some cases the combination of numbers may present a greater than usual difficulty, and 'appropriate' phrases or words may be almost impossible to devise. In such cases the solutions are still fairly simple. In the first case, you may make up inappropriate words out of the numbers you have to deal with, and then use the basic system, making absurd and exaggerated images which you link with the person whose telephone number you are trying to remember. For example, if the telephone number of one of your friends 133"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"whose hobby is cricket is 411-4276 you would take the Major System word for 41 which is 'rat', the Major word for 142 which is 'drain', and the Major word for 76 which is 'cage'. Your image for remembering this number would be of your friend swatting a rat instead of a cricket ball and of the rat flying through the air landing in a drain, the iron grill of which is similar to the bars of a cage! The telephone number memory system is easy and enjoy- able to practice, once you have mastered it. As with all other systems, it requires practice, so before you proceed to the next chapter make sure you have committed to memory at least 10 numbers which are important to you. 134"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN MEMORY SYSTEM FOR SCHEDULES AND APPOINTMENTS. As with telephone numbers, many people find appointments and schedules hard to remember. They employ similar systems for coping with their problem, the most common, of course, being the diary. Unfortunately many people don't always keep their diaries with them! In this chapter I introduce two systems, the first of which is for immediate daily use, the second for remembering schedules and appointments for an entire week. The first involves your basic peg systems. Simply equate the number in your system with the hour of your appointment. Since there are 24 hours in a day, you can either join the shorter system together, with an appropriate total of 24, or use the first 24 peg words in one of the larger systems. Let us assume you have the following appointments: 7—Early morning training 10—Dentist 1—Luncheon 6—Board meeting 10—Late film We will assume that you are using the Skipnum system to remember these appointments. At the beginning of the day, which in this case will certainly be no earlier than 5.30 a.m., you run through the list and check for words with associations. 7 a.m., represented by the word egg, is the time for your Early Morning Group Athletic Practice. Imagine your whole team running on eggshells, or enjoying a breakfast of egg before or after. At 10 a.m. (toast) you have an appointment with the dentist. Imagine all your teeth sinking into a piece of toast which causes pain. Your next appointment, at 1 p.m. (13.00) is for lunch. The 135"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"key word is 'tea'. Imagine the rather depressing prospect of a lunch at which nothing but tea is served. At 6 p.m. you have a Board Meeting. The Skipnum memory word for 18 (18.00 hours equals 6 p.m.) is 'tape'. The associa- tion here is not difficult—imagine the confidential matters of your Board Meeting being tape-recorded on an enormous machine. Finally you have an appointment at 10 p.m. (2200 hours) to see a late film. The Skipnum key word is 'troop'. Imagine the audience of which you will be a part as a well organised military force! The second system for remembering schedules and appoint- ments may be used for an entire week. As with the memory system for dates, take Sunday as day 1 of the week and ascribe a number to each of the other days: Sunday — 1 Monday — 2 Tuesday — 3 Wednesday— 4 Thursday — 5 Friday — 6 Saturday — 7 Having given a number to the day, we treat the hours as they are treated in the small system discussed above, and as they appear in railway, shipping and airline schedules. The day is considered to have 24 hours, from 2400 (midnight) through 1 a.m. (0100), noon (1200), 1 p.m. (1300) and back to midnight (2400). Thus for any hour and day of the week a two- or three-digit number is formed—day first, hour second. All that is necessary is to transfer the number into the word of the major system list. Having arrived at the word we link it with the appropriate appointment. Supposing you had an appointment to see a car you wanted to buy at 9.00 a.m. on Tuesday. Tuesday is represented by the number 3 which in the major system translates to the letter 'm'. The hour, 9, translates to the letter 'b,p'. Referring to the basic list we see that the key word for Tuesday at 9.00 a.m. is 'map'. To remember this appointment you might imagine the car you are going to see either bursting through a giant map, wrapped in a giant map, or driving across a giant map. 136"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"As another example, suppose you have an appointment for a guitar lesson at 5.00 p.m. (hour number 17) on a Thursday (day number 5). The number we derive from Thursday at 5.00 p.m. is 517, the word for this being 'leading'. To remem- ber this, imagine yourself leading an entire orchestra with your solo guitar! You may think this system a bit cumbersome, because it requires a fairly thorough knowledge of the larger numbers in the Major System, but this can be overcome by 'rotating' the hours of the day to suite those hours in which you have most appointments. If, for example, your day does not usually start until 10.00 a.m., then 10.00 a.m. can be considered to be number 1 in your appointment memory system. In this manner the most important and often-used hours in your day will nearly always be represented by only 2-digit numbers, i.e. the numbers from 10 to 100 in the Major System. 137"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN MEMORY SYSTEM FOR DATES IN OUR CENTURY When you have finished this chapter you will be able to give the correct day of the week for any date between the years 1900 to the present! Two systems may be used, the first of which is faster and simpler and applies to only one given year while the second spans many years and is a little harder. These systems owe much to Harry Lorayne, a well-known North American memory expert. Using the first of these systems, let us assume that we wish to know the day for any given date in the year 1971. In order to accomplish what may sound like a rather considerable feat, all that is necessary is to remember (or jot down), the following number: 377426415375 'Rubbish!' you might say, but when this system is explained you will see that it is in fact very clear and easy to operate. The individual digits of the 12-digit number represent the first Sunday for each month of the year 1971. The first Sunday in April, for example falls on the 4th day of the month, the first Sunday in December falls on the 5th day of the month, and so on. Once you have remembered this number, and I recommend that you remember it in the way that was explained in the Long Number memory system chapter, you will rapidly be able to calculate the day of the week for any date in the year. It is best to explain this concept with examples, so let us assume that your birthday fell on April 28th, and that you wished to know what day the date represented. Taking the 4th digit from your memory number you would realise that the first Sunday fell on the 4th. By the process of adding sevens to this initial Sunday date you rapidly calculate that the second Sunday of the month fell on the nth (4 + 7 = 11); the third 138"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Sunday of the month fell on the 18th (11 + 7 = 18) and that the last Sunday of the month fell on the 25th. Knowing this you recite the remaining dates and the days of the week until you arrive at the date in question: April 26th = Monday; April 27th = Tuesday; April 28th = Wednesday. In other words your birthday falls on a Wednesday in the year 1971! Suppose you wish to know the final day of the year. The process is similar. Knowing that the 1st Sunday of the last month falls on the 5th day you add the three sevens represent- ing the following Sundays to arrive at Sunday 26th. Reciting the next few dates and days we get: 27th Monday; 28th Tuesday; 29th Wednesday; 30th Thursday; 31st (the last day of the year!) a Friday. As you can see this system can be applied to any year for which you may especially need to know days for dates. All you have to do is to make up a memory number for the first Sunday, or for that matter the first Monday, Tuesday, etc. of each month of the year, add sevens where appropriate to bring you near to the day in question, and recite to that day. An interesting and quick way to make use of the memory number of one year with relation to surrounding years is to realise that with each year the first date for-the days at the beginning of the month goes down one, with the exception of leap years when the extra day produces a jump of two for the following year. In the years 1969, 1970, 1971 for instance the first Sunday for January in each of those years fell respectively on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd days of the month. The second of the two systems to be introduced in this chapter is for calculating the day for any date from 1900 to the present. It is necessary in this system to ascribe to each month a number which will always remain the same. The numbers for the months are as follows: 139 January — 1 February — 4 March — 4 April — 0 May — 2 June — 5 July — 0 August — 3 September — 6"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"October — 1 November — 4 December — 6 Some people suggest that these be remembered using asso- ciations such as January is the first month, the fourth letter in February is r which represents 4, and so on but I think that it is better to use the number: 144025036146 making the words drawer, snail, smash and tired. These can then be linked by imagining a drawer on which a snail with a very hard shell is eventually smashed after an effort which made you tired. In this way the key numbers for the months can be remembered. In addition to the key numbers for the months the years themselves have key numbers and I have listed them from 1900 to 1984, after which date, according to George Orwell, memory will be 'taken care of!'. How does this system work? Well, for once the answer is that it is not completely easy although with a little practice it can become almost second nature. The method is as follows, given the month, numerical date, and the year, you add the number represented by the month key to the number of the date, and add this total to the key number representing the year in question. From the total you subtract all the sevens, 140 0 1900 1906 1917 1923 1928 1934 1945 1951 1956 1962 1973 1979 1984 I 1901 1907 1912 1918 1929 1935 1940 1946 1957 1963 1968 1974 2 1902 1913 1919 1924 1930 I94I 1947 1952 1958 I969 1975 I98O 3 1903 1908 1914 1925 1931 1936 1942 1953 1959 1964 1970 1976 1981 4 1909 1915 1920 1926 1937 1943 1948 1954 1965 1971 1982 5 1904 1910 1921 1927 1932 1938 1949 1955 i960 1966 1977 1983 6 1905 1911 1916 1922 1933 1939 1944 1950 1961 1967 1972 1978"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"and the remaining number represents the day in the week, taking Sunday as day i. In order to check this system, we will take a couple of examples, one from a recent year, and one which if you have bought this book before the end of 1972, will be a day in the future. The day we will try to hunt down is the 19th March, 1969. Our key number for March is 4 which we must then add to the date in question which is 19, 19 + 4 = 23. To this total we must add the key number for the year 1969. Referring to the list we find that this is 2. Adding 2 to our previous total we arrive at 23 + 2 = 25. Subtracting all the sevens from this (3 X 7 — 21) we arrive at 25 — 21 = 4. The day in question is consequently the 4th day of the week which is a Wednesday! The date in the future we shall be concerned with is August 23rd 1972. Our key number for August is 3 which we add to 23 giving 26. The key number for the year 1972 is 6 which added to 26 gives us a total of 32. Subtracting all the sevens (4x7 = 28) from 32 we arrive at 4. The 4th day of the week is a Wednesday which is the day for August 23rd, 1972! The only exception to this rule occurs in leap years, and then only in the months of January and February. Your cal- culations will be identical but for these two months only the day of the week will be one day earlier than the day you cal- culate. As with other systems the best way to gain confidence with those discussed in this chapter is to practise them. I suggest that you start with the easier of the two first, become skilled in it, and then graduate to the more advanced. Both of these systems are excellent for entertaining your friends and social acquaintances. S.M.—8 141"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN MEMORY SYSTEM FOR IMPORTANT HISTORICAL DATES The two systems you have just learnt enable you to remember the day for any date in this century. The next system will assist you in the memorisation of significant dates in history. In Chapter 1 the memory test included a list of 10 such dates. They were: 1. 1666 — Fire of London. 2. 1770 — Beethoven's birthday. 3. 1215 — Signing of Magna Carta. 4. 1917 — Russian Revolution. 5. c.1454 — First Printing Press. 6. 1815 — Battle of Waterloo. 7. 1608 — Invention of the telescope. 8. 1905 — Einstein's theory of Relativity. 9. 1789 — French Revolution. 10. 1776 — Declaration of American Independence. The method for remembering these or any other such dates is simple, and is similar to the method for remembering tele- phone numbers. All you have to do is to make a word or string of words from the letters which represent the numbers of the date. In most cases there is no point in including the one representing the thousand, as you know the approximate date in any case. Let us try this system on the dates above. 1. The Fire of London in 1666 virtually destroyed the city leaving it a heap of ashes. Our memory phrase for the date 1666 would thus be ' a sh es , axAes, a sh es!', or 'cAarred ashes generally'. 2. Beethoven is famous for many musical accomplishments, but among his greatest and perhaps most controversial was the 9th Symphony in which he included a choir. His style of music made full use of the percussion instruments. Knowing this, 142"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"remembering his birthday in 1770 becomes easy: 'Crashing Choral Symphony'. 3. The signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 marked a new age of sense and reason. To remember this date we can use the phrase Wew Document—Liberalisation'. 4. The Russian Revolution of 1917 was an uprising of the people against what they considered abnormal oppression. They demanded greater equality in the form of Communism. Our memory phrase: 'People Demand Communism'. 5. Printing presses are often great rotating machines that churn out thousands of pages a minute. We can imagine a small version of this as the first printing press, in approximately 1454, which can be remembered by the word 'R o L le R'. 6. The Battle of Waterloo in 1815 was triumphant for Wellington but .can be considered fatal for Napoleon. Once again we use a memory word rather than a memory phrase to remember the date: 'FaTaL'. 7. The invention of the telescope by Galileo in 1608 changed the way in which man's eyes saw the sky. Our memory phrase: 'Changed Sky Focus'. 8. In 1905 Einstein's theory of relativity shed new light on the way in which matter and energy exist. His theory solved a number of puzzles that had occupied man, but also gave rise to many more. Our key word ' P u ZZL e'. 9. In the French Revolution in 1789 the king was ranged against the people. Hence we remember the date by '.King Fights People'. 10. The declaration of American Indepencence in 1776 marked a new feeling of optimism and confidence in the American way of life. This can be encapsulated in the one word: 'C o CKS ure '. As you can see, the system for remembering important dates in history is a simple one and should make a task which most people find hard an enjoyable exercise in creative remembering. 143"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN REMEMBERING BIRTHDAYS, ANNIVERSARIES AND DAYS AND MONTHS OF HISTORICAL DATES This next system will be easy for you because it makes use of systems you have already learned. It is also easier than most other systems suggested for remembering such items, because the two large memory systems you have learned—Skipnum and the Major System—may be used together as 'keys' for the months and days (other systems usually require code names that have to be especially devised for the months). The system works as follows: months are assigned the appropriate key word from the Major System. The days from 1 to 31 are assigned the appropriate word from the Skipnum system. To remember a birthday, anniversary or historical date, all that is necessary is to form a linked image between the month- and day-words and the date you wish to remember. For example, your girl-friend's birthday falls on November 1st. The key word from the Major System for November is 'tate'; and the key word from Skipnum for 'one' is 'up'. You imagine that your girl-friend is framed or hung up in the Tate Gallery. 144 January — Tea February — Noah March — Ma April — Ray May — Law June — Jaw July — Key- August — Poe September — Pa October — Toes November — Tate December — Tan"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The anniversary you wish to remember is your parent's Wedding Anniversary which falls on February 25th. The Major System key word for February is 'Noah'; the Skipnum key word for 25 is 'try'. Imagine Noah, who 'married' the pairs of animals, trying to marry your parents at the same time. Historical dates are just as easy to remember. For example the date when the United Nations came into formal existence was October 24th. The Major System key word for October is 'toes', and the Skipnum key word for 24 is 'trot'. We imagine the different shaped and coloured toes of representatives of the world's nations hurrying (trotting) to meet because of the urgency created by the end of the Second World War. There is one small danger in this system, and this is epitom- ised by those people who don't forget the date—they forget to remember it! This can be overcome by making a habit of checking through, on a regular basis, your memory links for the coming one or two weeks. The memory system outlined in this chapter can be effect- ively linked with the previous system for remembering historical dates by year. In this way you will have provided yourself with a complete date-remembering system. 145"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN MEMORY SYSTEM FOR SPEECHES, JOKES, NARRATIVES, DRAMATIC PARTS AND POEMS, ARTICLES The problems and embarrassments with the items listed in the title of this chapter are almost endless! The speech maker, terrified that he will make a blunder in front of his audience, usually reverts to reading word-for- word from a prepared text, the result of which is inevitably a monotonous and de-personalised presentation. The slightly more courageous speech-maker will often commit his speech to memory, falling into the trap of scrambling through it as fast as possible in order to get to the end before he forgets something! In most cases he does forget something and the most awkward silences ensue as he gropes for the lost thread. Similar, although not so important, situations arise in the telling of jokes. These are not so much embarrassing to the story teller as annoying to the person to whom the joke is being told. How familiar is the situation in which, after ages of build up, the story teller suddenly looks at you with a slack jaw and the exclamation 'Damn! I've forgotten the punch line, but anyway it was a really funny story'. Dramatic parts present a different problem in that they are usually to be memorised by actors who have continual practise sessions with the same material. Their task is nevertheless still difficult, and each member of the group must make sure that his familiarity with the material is at least on a par with that of the other members. In more lengthy and difficult works, soliloquies and poems are among the items that have to be remembered, and the task becomes even more difficult. Remembering articles is often necessary in an academic or business situation, embarrassment usually arising during exam time when the student 'knows that he knows' but just can't get the information off the tip of his tongue or his mind; and in the business situation where one is asked to discuss a report that 146"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"everyone else has read, and either goes completely blank or cannot recall a major point. These are the problems. How can they be solved? Un- fortunately there is no simple system such as the Link and Peg systems discussed previously, but there are methods and techniques that make the remembering of this kind of material much easier. As the techniques vary slightly in different cases, I shall consider each individually. Speeches If you wish to make a good speech one of the cardinal rules is never to memorise it word for word. Another is never to read it. 1. Generally research the topic about which you are going to speak, making recordings of ideas, quotations and references which you think\" might prove relevant. 2. Having completed your basic research sit down and plan out the basic structure of your presentation. Do not start to write your speech before you have completed your basic design. I have known people who have written the 'same' speech seven times before arriving at their final draft. If they had organised themselves a little more adequately to begin with, weeks could have been saved! 3. With your basic structure in front of you fill in the details in note form so that you complete an outline which needs only grammatical and sentence structure changes to become a coherent presentation. 4. Practise making your speech from this completed out- line! You will find that, having completed the research and having thought about the structure of the material, you will already have nearly memorised your speech! Initially, of course, there will be points at which you hesitate, but with a little practice you will find that not only do you know your speech, you also know what you are talking about ! This point is especially important, for it means that when you finally do speak to your audience you need have no fear of forgetting the word-order or what you are presenting. You simply say what you have to say, using the appropriate voca- bulary and not a rigid succession of sentence structures. In other words, you become a creative rather than a static speaker. This is Always preferably. 5. As a precautionary step it is advisable to jot down on a 147"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"small card, or to remember on one of your smaller memory systems, the key words in the basic outline of your speech. This greatly reduces the possibility of forgetting. The only problem you may consider still unsolved is that of not being able, immediately, to find the right word at the right time. Don't worry about this. When the audience senses that a speaker knows what he is talking about, an effective pause makes it obvious that he is creating on the platform. This adds rather than subtracts from the enjoyment of listen- ing, for it makes the presentation less formal and more spontaneous. Jokes and Narratives Jokes and narratives are far easier to deal with than are speeches, because most of the creative work has already been done for you! The problem is nevertheless a two-fold one: first, you must remember the joke or narrative to begin with, and second, you must remember its details. The first of these problems is easily solved by using a section of the major system as a permanent library for the stories you wish to file. I need go into this point no further, as it is simply a matter of selecting a key word and associating it with the key word of the System. The second problem is slightly more difficult to overcome, and involves once again our use of the link system. Let us take, for example, the joke about the man who went to the pub and bought a pint of beer. Having bought this beer, he sud- denly realised he had to make a telephone call, but knew that some of the 'characters' in the bar might well swipe his pint before he returned. In order to prevent this he wrote on his glass 'I am the World's Karate Champion.' and went to make his telephone call, securely thinking that his beer was safe. When he returned he saw immediately that his glass was empty and noticed more scribbling underneath his own. It read 'I am the World's fastest runner—thanks!' To remember this joke we consciously select key words from it, joining them into the basic narrative. All we need from this full paragraph of narration are the words 'pint', 'phone', 'write', 'karate champion', and 'runner'. With these few words, which can be linked in whatever way we please, the whole sequence and essence of the joke will 148"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"return immediately, and those horrible silences as one runs out of steam in the middle of a story need never recur! Articles Articles may need to be remembered on a very short-term basis or on a long-term basis, and the systems for remembering each are different. If you have to attend a meeting or to make a brief resume of an article you have only recently read, you can remember it almost totally, and at the same time can astound your listeners by remembering the pages you are referring to! The method is simple: take one, two or three ideas from each page of the article and slot them on to one of your peg memory systems. If there is only ono idea per page, you will know that when you are down to memory word 5 in your basic system, you are referring to the 5th page, whereas if there are two ideas per page and you are at memory word 5 you will know you are the top of page 3! When an article has to be remembered over a longer period of time, we once again revert to the link system, taking key words from the article and linking them in such a way as to make them most memorable. This method of remembering will enable you not only to recall the sequence of the events and ideas but also to retain a more adequate general impression of what the article was about. The act of consciously attempting to remember is itself a part of learning. Dramatic Parts and Poems The last section of this chapter deals with those two items that have been in the past, and are still unfortunately today, the bane of the schoolchild. The method usually employed (and recommended) is to read a line over and over again, 'get it'; read the next line, 'get it'; join the two together; 'get them'; read the next line and so on ad nausum until the first lines have been forgotten! A system recommended and used successfully by well- known actors and actresses is almost the reverse. In this system the material to be remembered is read and re-read quickly but with understanding over a period of four days, approximately 5 times a day. In this manner the reader becomes far more familiar with the material than he realises and at the end of his 20th reading tries to recall, without looking at the text, the material to be remembered. Almost without fail the mind will 149"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"have absorbed 90% or more totally, and remembering will have been a natural outgrowth of reading! As I have said, this system has been found far more success- ful than the line-by-line repeating system, but even it can be improved considerably. Once again the link system and key words come into play. If the material to be remembered is poetry, a few major key words will help the mind to 'fill in' the remaining words which will almost automatically fall into place between the key words. If the material to be remembered is part of a script, once again key words and linking images can prove essential. The basic content of a long speech can be strung together with ease, and the cues from speaker to speaker can also be handled far more effectively. It is these cues that often cause chaos on the stage because of the silences and breaks in continuity that may occur when one performer forgets his last word or another forgets his first. If these last words (or even actions) are linked in the way that we link objects in our memory system, breaks and confusion can be completely avoided. In summary, the remembering of speeches, narratives, jokes, articles, dramatic parts and poems involves a number of slightly differing techniques. In all cases, however, the use of some form of link, key words, and repetition is necessary. 150"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEEN MEMORY SYSTEMS FOR LANGUAGES When hearing the word 'language', some tend to think only of foreign languages. Seldom do they stop to think that the term includes their own tongue! The title of this chapter conse- quently refers to English as well as to other languages! As I mentioned in my book Speed Reading vocabulary is considered to be the most important single factor not only in the development of efficient reading but also in academic and business success. This is not surprising when one realises that the size of one's vocabulary is usually an indication of the depth of one's knowledge. Since vocabulary is the basic building block of language, it it desirable and necessary to develop methods of learning and remembering words more easily. One of the better ways of accomplishing this aim is to learn the prefixes (letters, syllables or words recurring before root words) the suffixes (letters, syllables or words recurring at the end of root words) and the roots (words from which others are derived) that occur most frequently in the language you are attempting to learn. A comprehensive list of these appears in the vocabulary chapters of my book Speed Reading. Here are some more tips on how to improve your word memory: 1. Browse through a good dictionary, studying the ways in which the prefixes, suffixes and roots of the language are used. Whenever possible, use association to strengthen your recall. 2. Introduce a fixed number of new words into your vocabulary everyday. New words are retained only if the principle of repetitions as explained earlier, is practised. Use your new words in context and as many times as possible after you have initially learned them. 3. Consciously look for new words in the language. This directing of your attention, known as 'mental set', leaves the 'hooks' of your memory more open to catch new linguistic fish! 151"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"These are general learning aids to assist your memory in acquiring knowledge of a language. They may be applied to English, as a means for improving your present vocabulary, or to any foreign languages you are beginning to learn. Having established a general foundation for learning words, let us be more specific in the remembering of particular words. As with other memory systems the key word is association. In the context of language-learning it is well to associate sounds, images and similarities, using the fact that certain languages are grouped in 'families' and have words that are related. To give you an idea of this linking method, I shall consider a few words from English, French, Latin and German. In English we want to remember the word 'vertigo' which means dizziness or giddiness, and in which a person feels as if he or surrounding objects are turning around. To imprint this word on the memory we associate the sound of it with the phrase 'where to go?' which is the kind of question you would ask if you felt that all surrounding objects were rotating about you! Two words which many people confuse in the English language are: 'acrophobia', which is a morbid fear of heights, and 'agoraphobia' which is a morbid fear of open spaces. The distinction can be firmly established if you associate the 'aero' in acrophobia with acrobat (a person who performs at great height!) and the 'agora' from agoraphobia with agriculture, bringing to mind images of large flat fields (though the Greek word actually means marketplace!). Foreign languages are more 'approachable' when one realises that they form groups. Virtually all European lan- guages (with the exception of Finnish, Hungarian and Basque) are part of the Indo-European group, and consequently contain a number of words which are similar in both sound and meaning. For example the words for father: German 'vater', Latin 'pater', French 'pere', Italian and Spanish 'padre'. A knowledge of Latin is of enormous help in understanding all the Romance languages, in which many of the words are similar. The Latin word for 'love' is 'amor'. Related to 'love' in the English language is the word 'amorous' which means inclined to love; in love; and of or pertaining to love—the links are obvious. Similarly we have the Latin word for 'god': 'Deus'. In English the words Deity and Deify mean respect- ively 'divine status; a god; the Creator' and 'to make a god of. 152"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"French was derived from the vulgar speech of the Roman legionaries, who called a head 'testa', a crockery shard, hence 'tete', and the shoulder 'spatular', a small spade, hence 'epaule', etc. About fifty per cent of ordinary English speech is derived either directly from Latin (+ Greek) or by way of Norman French, leading to many direct analogies between French and English. As well as language similarities based on language grouping, foreign words can be remembered in a manner similar to that explained for remembering English words. As we are discuss- ing French, the following two examples are appropriate: In French the word for 'book' is 'livre'. This can be remembered more readily if you think of the first four letters of the word 'Library' which is a place where books are classified and studied. The-French word for 'pen' is 'plume' which in English refers td a bird's feather, especially a large one used for ornament. This immediately brings to mind the quill pen used widely before the invention of the steel nib, fountain pen and biro. The link-chain 'plume—feather—quill—pen' will make the remembering of the French word a simple task. Apart from the Latin, Greek, and French, the rest of English is largely Anglo-Saxon, going back to German, giving rise to countless words that are virtually the same in German and English—glass, grass, will, hand, arm, bank, halt, wolf, etc. while others are closely related, light (licht), night (nacht), book (buch), stick (stock) and follow (folgen). Learning languages, both our own and those of other people's, need not be the frustrating and depressing experience it so often is. It is simply a matter of organising the informa- tion you have to learn in such a way as to enable your memory to 'hook on' to every available scrap of information! The methods outlined in this chapter should give you a solid basis for becoming more proficient in the various languages, and for enjoying the process of becoming more efficient. 153"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY REMEMBERING FOR EXAMINATIONS Few people hear the word 'examination' without a slight feeling of fear or distaste. In Speed Reading, I have dealt comprehensively with methods for studying three to ten times more effectively. Here I'm going to discuss examinations in relation to memory systems. Typically, the person taking an examination dashes to his seat in order to use all the available time and reads his exam- ination paper so nervously, quickly and confusedly that he has to read it over again to find out just what it is he is being asked. At this stage he usually becomes flustered, desperately trying to co-ordinate all the information which he thinks might relate to the question he is trying to answer, but which is buried in the mire of all his other disorganised knowledge. How often have you yourself, or have you seen someone else write an examination, spending as much as 15 minutes of an hour's time jotting down notes, scratching his head, resting his chin on his hand, and frowning as he frantically tries to recall all that he knows and yet at this moment does not know? Such students often possess more knowledge about the subject than others. I remember at least three students in my undergraduate years who knew more about certain subjects than virtually everyone in the class and who used to give private tuition and coaching to those who were struggling. Extraordinarily and regularly, these students would fail to excel at examination time, invariably complaining that they had not had time in the examination room to gather together the knowledge they had. Problems such as theirs can be overcome by preparing for examinations using the Major and Skipnum Memory Systems, in conjunction with the link system. Let us assume that the subject to be examined is psycho- logy. Reviewing your notes, you realise that in the year's study you have covered four major areas, and that each area had four 154"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"or five main theories, four or five major figures, and a number of experiments. Applying this information to the memory system, you link the name of the first major area with the first word of the system, list the main theories on the following numbers, the main figures on the next numbers and after that the experi- ments. For the next major area you repeat this process until you have covered the major key words and ideas for the content of the year's course. Should any of these items have smaller items which you think might be significant, they can be linked to the key psychology words. It may surprise you to learn that in circumstances where my students have applied these systems, their memory list for any given subject in a yearly exam seldom exceeds 70 items! In the examination room they are immediately far ahead of their erstwhile \"peers. When considering their answers to questions, they simply survey their organised knowledge in less than a minute, selecting those items that are relevant. In addition, the items selected are already in an 'essay' form. In the example we are using, the answer to any question could take the following form 'in considering the problem of blank and blank I wish to discuss three of the major areas of psychology, citing the theories of blank from the second, and the theories of blank and blank from the third area. In connec- tion with these areas and theories I will also consider the importance of the following major figures in the history of these ideas, and shall discuss in relation to the entire question the following experiments: ...' Without having said anything our imaginary student already sounds well on the way to a 1st class! Indeed he may well be, for as his initial fact getting-down task has been made so much more easy, the amount of time left to him for creative discussion and comment on what he has written will be greater. To carry this last point a little further—it is advisable to peg on to your memory system creative or original ideas that flash into your mind concerning the subject of examination. These often make the difference between a 1st and 2nd class, yet normally they tend either to get mixed up in a generally con- fused presentation of knowledge and ideas or lost in the heat of the moment. Smaller details, including the titles of books, articles and 155"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"dates, can obviously be co-ordinated with the system explained above. Examinations are not all that difficult. Explaining what you know in an organised and coherent fashion to an examiner can be—use your memory systems to help you! 156"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE REMEMBER TO REMEMBER! You have now completed your basic course and should have learnt no fewer than twenty different systems for remembering different items! After being given a rough historical context within which to work, you were given an initial memory test designed to establish the limits of your memory at that time. The first chapters (in an attempt to overcome as rapidly as possible the deficiencies laid bare by the test!) dealt with the basic principles of remembering, giving you practice in the rules of exaggeration, movement, substitution and absurdity. The principles learnt in these systems were then applied to the new memory system of Heinz Norden, Skipnum, and to the Major System. From the Major System you were able to branch out into the remembering of numbers, anniversaries, birthdays and historical dates, including the year, month and day. Apart from this you learnt systems for remembering names and faces, speeches, jokes, narratives, articles, languages, and playing cards. With the information you now possess you are ready to use your memory in a far more adequate and comprehensive way. Apart from your business and social life many of the systems may be used to give 'memory demonstrations' ranging from reeling off lists of items to picking out the 'missing cards' from a deck. Building a good memory is much like growing up. You develop a little day by day but seldom notice the changes until you suddenly look back at yourself, often through other people's eyes, writing or photographs. You may not even now be fully aware of the strides you have made during your reading of Speed Memory. To see just how far you have come, go back and look at the 'photograph' of your memory as recorded in the initial memory 157"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"test. Things which at that time appeared (and were!) difficult will now seem like child's play. We have come to the end of the course, but in a sense it is only a beginning. At the moment you are using abstract systems to remember items that have given you difficulty in the past. By continuing to use these systems and actively concerning yourself with remembering to remember, you will find that the systems themselves will become unnecessary, and that through the process of consciously working to improve your memory with 'artificial aids', you will have helped it to become vigorous and independent. 158"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"If you feel you have benefited from reading this book why not invest in a copy of Tony Buzan's SPEED READING by Sphere Books.
